 A gang of boys on the road to crime

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Catch them young and watch them grown as criminals police have stumbled upon the strategy put into practice by a South 24-Parganas gang. 

 The case came to light on Friday morning, when four boys in the age-group of 10 to 15 were caught red-handed in Baruipur while they were trying to escape with an electronic weighing machine and other machinery from an oil mill. 

 The youngest member of the gang, caught by local residents, was identified as Sheikh Raja. 

 I saw the children coming out from the back door of the mill, carrying jute bags on their shoulders. I got suspicious when they tried to run away as I approached them. But finally, we managed to catch them, recounted Samarjit Sarkar, owner of the oil mill.

 The commotion near the mill drew more people and it was decided that the boys be handed over to the police. They were then taken to Baruipur police station. 

 When the cops searched the jute bags, the weighing machine and other mill equipment were found. 

 During interrogation, the boys revealed that they were engaged by a dada, said an officer of Baruipur police station. All the boys are from poor backgrounds and are school drop-outs. 

 The police have learnt that the boys have been used in trailing people and collecting information about their assets. We believe that the children can throw up some leads for us about some recent cases of theft in the district, the officer said. 

 As the interrogation revealed that there were some more children in the gang, the boys were taken to their village in Canning, in South 24-Parganas. The police detained three boys of the same agegroup from Canning. 

 According to the police, they are now trying to locate the leader of the gang, which had hired the services of the boys. 

 Our officers from Baruipur police station took them to different places and obtained some vital clues about recent thefts and dacoities. We are looking for the gang leader and hope to get him soon, said South 24-Parganas police superintendent S.N. Gupta.

 The police are in touch with the parents of the boys, who have been detained for interrogation.

 We are yet to take a decision on producing them in juvenile court, said an officer.

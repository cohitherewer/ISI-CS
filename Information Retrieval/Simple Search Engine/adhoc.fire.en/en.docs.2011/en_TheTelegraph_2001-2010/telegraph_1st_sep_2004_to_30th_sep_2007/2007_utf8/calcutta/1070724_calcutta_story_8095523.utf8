 Meeting on cable problems

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The nodal officer of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) met representatives of MSOs and cable operators on Monday following a spate of complaints from cable television subscribers. 

 According to industry sources, the complaints reached the Trai office in Writers Buildings in the past 75 days from both CAS and non-CAS areas.

 The Trai chairman, Nripendra Mishra, had asked Abhijit Sanyal, the nodal officer, to sort out the problems.

 The meeting was attended by representatives of three MSOs and 11 organisations of cable operators. There will be another meeting on July 25

 Consumers have always had grievances against cable operators. But this is the first time in two decades that Trai conducted a meeting to resolve the problems faced by the consumers, said an industry insider.

 The regulatory body is aware of an attempt by a section of MSOs and cable operators to sabotage the launch of CAS and have decided to take stringent measures against those who are involved in it. Theres a provision for cancellation of licences, he added.

 Most of the complaints from the CAS areas were regarding unavailability of set-top boxes and lack of rental options, in violation of Trai directives. 

 Subscribers have also complained of poor picture quality even after digitisation of signals, said Sanyal.

 Complainants from non-CAS areas have written about the same problem and also of non-availability of channels. Many popular channels have been taken out of the prime band and slotted in the secondary band, resulting in poor picture quality. Channels are also being taken off air without notice. The MSOs are pressuring the cable operators to force the consumer to opt for set-top boxes even before CAS is launched in their area, said an official of the state information and cultural affairs department.

 We hope to find a solution to these problems soon. We need to address these issues before CAS is launched in the remaining parts of the city and its suburbs, stated Sanyal.

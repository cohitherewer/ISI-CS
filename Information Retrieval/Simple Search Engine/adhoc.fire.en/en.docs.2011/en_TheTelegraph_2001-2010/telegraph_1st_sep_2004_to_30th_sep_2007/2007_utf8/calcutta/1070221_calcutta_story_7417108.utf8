The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Honesty by jobless youth

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 24-year-old unemployed stumbled upon a packet containing Rs 25,000 in a near-empty bus. He took the packet home and fought moments of temptation to keep the money, but finally handed it over to police.

 We were taken aback when Uttam Dey, a resident of South Sinthee Road, walked in to deposit the packet. He has set an example, said Bimal Chowdhury, officer-in-charge of Cossipore police station. 

 Uttam, who once worked as a daily-wager, boarded a minibus at the Shyambazar five-point crossing around 9.15 pm on his way home on Monday. He was the only passenger when the bus reached Sinthee. 

 Uttam spotted the packet while getting off the bus and took it home. 

 I opened the packet after dinner and was stunned to find 50 currency notes of Rs 500 denomination inside. My initial impulse was to keep the cash, he recalled. 

 But soon, I realised that the person who had mistakenly left behind the packet in the bus must be in need of money. It would be inhuman not to return the packet to him, he added.

 Left without any clue about the owner, Uttam thought it best to approach police and hand over the packet to them.

 No one has come forward to claim the money. All police stations have been alerted to trace the owner of the packet, said Cossipore thana officer-in-charge Chowdhury.

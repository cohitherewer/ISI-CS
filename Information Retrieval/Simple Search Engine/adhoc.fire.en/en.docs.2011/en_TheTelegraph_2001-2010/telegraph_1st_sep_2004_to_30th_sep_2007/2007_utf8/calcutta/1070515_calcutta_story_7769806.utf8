 Cop breather for criminal

 Community policing seems to have gone for a toss.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees brainchild aimed at ensuring closer cooperation between police and public for better tackling of law and order problems has ended up giving legitimacy to law-breakers.

 Complaints are pouring in at the Lalbazar headquarters that quite a few criminals have been inducted into the coordination committees working as an interface between the force and the people. 

 Recently, a criminal was invited to a blood donation camp organised by Tollygunge thana on its premises as part of police-public initiative.

 An outcry by local residents forced the authorities to sack the officer-in-charge (OC) of the police station on charges of inviting the goon.

 An Alipore resident said two alleged criminals from the area, Raju and Osman, have been made members of the coordination committee of the local police station.

 Each and every complaint is being investigated and officers found guilty of joining hands with criminals will be sternly dealt with, asserted a senior officer at Lalbazar.

 Another officer said that the OCs of all 48 police stations in the city have been asked to furnish the names of the members of the coordination committees. The panels were formed on orders from the chief minister himself.

 Community policing has been our thrust area, as it has proved successful in curbing crimes. But of late it has received a blow, as respectable citizens are being made to share the coordination committees with local rowdies . We are determined to stop this, the officer added.

 Insiders said community policing has not been properly implemented over the past couple of years because of cynicism of local residents and lack of planning by the OCs.

 Initially, the concept was successful, as police officers would regularly sit with coordination committee members. On the eve of festivals like the Durga puja and Id, we would together chalk out the security plan. But over the past few months, not a single meeting has been called, said Arindam Banerjee, a member of the coordination committee of Alipore Police Station.

 The committee in our area has not met even once for the past year. Criminals now have a free run at night. The local police station is least bothered, said Abdul Rashid, a school teacher and member of the coordination committee of Ekbalpore police station.

 Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee said: I will take action if you can name the thanas where community policing is not being implemented. The police stations have been asked to send detailed reports of meetings.

 Snap out of reality

 Maitys Art 

 SOUMITRA DAS

 Bhupen in the Morning

 Snehasish Maity was trained at Government Art College and MS University at Baroda. So, although he has been exposed to a cross-section of experimentation, he cannot give up his training rooted in academism. In his practice, however, he gives it a twist that separates his work from straightforward realism.

 The 36-year-old artist, whose works are being displayed at Gallery Katayun, calls it hyper-realism and it is very closely related to photographic realism that was in vogue some time ago. Some of his canvases are quite large and he joins two or three frames to produce these. So, many of them could look like Bollywood posters, now that vinyl is used to make billboards. Maity clarifies that he uses oil paint, not acrylic, in keeping with his academic training.

 The surfaces of his paintings are glossy and smooth, like the skin of hoardings. He heightens the unreality of these more-than-real paintings by using colours that could be recommended for the advertisements of a paint company. A self-portrait is deep purple and bottle green, giving it the look of a funeral that may have appeared in a dream. He also uses fresh peaches and cream and rose that would be just perfect for miladys walls or even her skin.

 He appropriates images of musclemen and other icons of machismo and turns them on their head. Imagine a bilious green Bhupen Khakkar, who made no secret of his proclivities, flexing his non-existent muscles. Behind him is a small figure of a man holding a hat who is perhaps David Hockney, and an even smaller figure of a boy in shorts in the distance. The message could not have been clearer. 

 In another work covering three canvases, the artist reveals his lanky body and strikes a poster-boy pose squeezed between two halves of the head of a snarling tiger. There are such touches of humour waiting to be discovered in Maitys work.

 Maity looks at the jingoism of the defence forces and that of the so-called terrorists as two sides of the same coin. Their motives may be different but they could both be harbingers of death and destruction. The most disconcerting of his paintings is that of a sinking man, his face and consciousness about to turn into a blur. We stare death in the face.

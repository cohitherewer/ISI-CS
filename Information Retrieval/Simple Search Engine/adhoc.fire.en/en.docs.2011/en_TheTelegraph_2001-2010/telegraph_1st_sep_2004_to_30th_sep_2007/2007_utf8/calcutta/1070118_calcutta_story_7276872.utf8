 Signal was worth the Risk

 Juggling item numbers for real roles, TANUSHREE DUTTA tells Pratim D. Gupta how the Bengali bombshell in her became a Marathi mulgi for Hichki

 Tanushree Dutta with Randeep Hooda in Risk 

 After being the centre of attention in films like Aashiq Banaya Apne and Chocolate, what are you doing in a man-man movie like Risk?

 Yes, Risk is definitely a man-oriented film revolving around the underworld and cops. But I do figure there somewhere. Otherwise I wouldnt be doing the film, would I? In between all the fighting, I provide the glam element in the film, the emotional quotient in the movie. I am there to soften up all the action, at a few places.

 So its not about two songs and one-and-a-half scenes?

 Not at all. Risk is very special to me because director Vishram Sawant has cast me in such a real and sensitive role. Thats something I have not really done before. When he approached me, Vishram told me, Tanushree, the way you will look and perform in this film will be totally different. And he has kept his promise. 

 But all everyone is talking about is your Lavani (popular Marathi music form) number in the film, Hichki

 See, you cant deny the fact that songs promote the film. Unless the songs become popular among the masses, the film wont get a good start and that much-required push. Of course, if the films not good, no song can make it work. But I am very happy with the way Hichki has become popular. I enjoyed every moment of doing a Lavani song, something in the tradition with Bollywood actresses from Dimple Kapadia (Bobby) to Madhuri Dixit (Sailaab). And they have a penchant for being popular with the masses. I had to wear the kashta (the nine-yard sari) and the nath (Maharashtrian nose ring).

 Were you at ease dancing in such outfits in public places like the Gateway of India?

 Its a job. I am not a trained dancer as such. But there is the choreographer and all the extras and we have to do it for the movie. For Hichki, I couldnt have pulled it off without (choreographer) Masterji Ganesh Acharya. He has made it look so Indian, so enduring.

 This is the first time you are being made to look Indian

 Completely! And thats good for any actor because one can now get a variety of roles. Film-makers have seen me in those Western outfits in films like Aashiq Banaya Apne and Chocolate and now they can see me in this desi avatar in Risk.

 How was it working with Randeep Hooda and Vinod Khanna in Risk?

 Randeep is a fabulous co-star. There is a beautiful relationship between his character and mine in the film. Randeep is very hardworking and that shows in his performance.

 As for Vinod Khanna, unfortunately I have no scenes with him. I have definitely been a big Vinod Khanna fan and I even told Vishram to create a scene featuring the two of us. But that was not to be. I comfort myself saying that at least he and I are in the same film.

 After a dull 2006, you have a long list of releases this year

 Yes, theres Raj Kanwars Raqeeb with Rahul Khanna, Jimmy Sheirgill and Sharman Joshi, shot mainly in Bangkok. Theres Vikram Bhatts Speed which has Aftab Shivdasani, Sanjay Suri, Zayed Khan and Urmila Matondkar. Then theres Mukta Artss film Good Boy Bad Boy with Emraan Hashmi, Tusshar Kapoor and Isha Sharvani. I play the bad girl. So, thats experimental, too. But the film I am most excited about is Priyadarshans Dhol. I am the only heroine in the film starring Kunal Khemu, Tusshar Kapoor, Sharman Joshi and Rajpal Yadav. It is a big comedy and a completely mad caper.

 So the Signal item number in Priyadarshans Bhagam Bhag sealed the deal...

 Signal has been one of the best decisions I have taken till now. When I was doing the song, everyone asked me why I was doing an item number. All I did was shrug my shoulders and asked them to wait and watch. Some offers do not look lucrative at the onset but I knew Signal was a goldmine. It wasnt exactly a typical sexy item song in small clothes, it had a comic side to it. The number has done so well and I have a superhit song to my credit. It has also boosted my stage performances. And now Priyanji has given me a full film for that one song. Now I have been turning down item songs. But that one Signal was worth the risk.

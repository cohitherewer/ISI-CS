 Five students of Hare School and Hindu School had a close shave when the pool car they were travelling in rammed into a private bus after being hit by another bus on Bankim Setu, in Howrah, on Wednesday afternoon.

 Police said no one was injured. The students were rescued from the damaged vehicle by a traffic constable and passersby. 

 The bus, on route 55, hit the pool car, a Maruti Omni, around noon. The driver of the car lost control and hit another bus, said an officer of Howrah traffic police.

 It was a case of reckless driving. Fortunately, the car did not overturn. This was the third accident on Bankim Setu in the past five days, pointed out the officer.

 The driver of the bus on route 55 managed to escape, though the vehicle was impounded.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Balance between growth amp; nature

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With the forces of development changing the citys skyline, the immediate need for Calcutta is a balance between development and environment. 

 It was the unanimous view at a panel discussion in search of an alternative metropolis in West Bengal on Holi eve at Loreto College.

 The state of the citys environment is shocking. We must strike a balance between development and environment, said M.L. Meena, a panelist and state environment secretary, adding that the need was to look beyond Calcutta.

 In the war of words, organised by Loreto College, the panelists differed on the role of government in catalysing the growth of such a metropolis.

 Kalyan Roy of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority felt the government did not have any significant role, as the metropolis has to evolve automatically. 

 But Monideep Chatterjee, former professor of Jadavpur University, thought otherwise and argued that the Siliguri-Jalpaiguri area had the right potential to become states next metropolis. 

 Asok Bhattacharya, state urban development and municipal affairs minister, had advocated the same argument during the inaugural session.

 The students of the colleges geography department made a presentation on potential metropolitan centres in Bengal, which the participants appreciated.

 As the issue of spreading urbanisation kept coming back time and again, developers Harsh Neotia and Rahul Todi observed that the state government was playing an important role in creating urban centres across the state.

 And the effect of urban centres away from Calcutta was visible, claimed Biswadeep Gupta of the Confederation of Indian Industry. Even knowledge-based companies are looking at options beyond Calcutta, he added.

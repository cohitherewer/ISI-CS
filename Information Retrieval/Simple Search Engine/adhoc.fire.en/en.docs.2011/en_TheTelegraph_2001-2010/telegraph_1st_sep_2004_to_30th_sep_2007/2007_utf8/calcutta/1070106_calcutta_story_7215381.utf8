 Joy Bangla!

 A thought For Food

 What: Kakra Chingri Mahotsav. 

 Where: Tero Parbon at 49C Purna Das Road.

 When: Till January 31.

 Big bite: The Bengali speciality restaurant is serving seafood dishes that are quintessentially Bengal, with a twist here and there to make them palatable to todays generation. 

 The crab spread includes Kurkure Kakra, Tel-E-Jhara Kakra, Rajadhiraj Kakra, Posto Kakra and Shahebi Kakra. 

 The prawn list is innovative with Maharani Chingri, Doi Chingri, Apple Chingri, Shahebi Chingri and Mohun Bagan Chingri. If you want the best of both, a must-have delicacy called Jugalbandi combines both prawns and crabs.

 Pocket pinch: Dishes are priced between Rs 40 and Rs 250. An average meal for two would cost Rs 350.

 Voiceover: Now that all the parties are over, most people want to relax with home food, especially NRIs who miss authentic Bangla food and are in town for a holiday. The kitchen repertoire of Bengalis is vast and we wish to give our customers the best, says Subrata Ghose Chaudhuri, director of the restaurant.

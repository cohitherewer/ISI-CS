 Town planner post

 - Brief is to regulate development

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 For the first time since Independence, Calcutta has got a qualified town planner who will supervise and regulate development activities across the city.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has appointed Dipankar Sinha, a postgraduate in town planning registered with the Council of Architecture, India, to the post.

 His main function will be to redress the problems created by unregulated development for the past 50 years and to frame guidelines, both at the individual and institutional levels, for future projects to ensure a balanced growth across the city, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 The revival of the town planners post created in 1903 and replaced with a Town Planning Committee that functioned till 1947 followed repeated prods by foreign funding agencies, such as the Asian Development Bank (Manila), Department for International Development (UK) and the US Aid.

 Stressing the need for a town planner for Calcutta, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said the appointment is the first step towards curbing adhocracy in the planning and execution of infrastructure projects, resulting in long-term problems instead of creating long-term assets.

 We have made a mess of the city in the name of development be it in laying roads, setting up civic markets, boring tubewells or sanctioning building plans, said Bandyopadhyay. The city will die of suffocation if the practice is not stopped immediately.

 According to civic engineers, a classic example of uncontrolled and unplanned development is the constant demand for booster pumping stations. Even after commissioning around a dozen stations at a cost of more than Rs 300 crore, several pockets in the city are in the grip of water supply problems.

 Sinha pointed out: Water from Tallah would rise to the second floor in Sealdah, Maniktala and Bhowanipore in the early 1960s. Now, water pressure has fallen so low that taps in these areas have to be fitted below the road level.

 A civic official admitted that drainage, water supply, conservancy or other facilities are not taken into account while sanctioning a building plan.

 JEE tests ticked off

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state joint entrance examination (JEE) board has introduced a string of changes in the selection process of engineering and medical colleges.

 The board has decided to do away with its three-year-old system of setting test papers with only multiple-choice questions (MCQ). From 2008, the question papers will have 80 per cent MCQ and 20 per cent short questions.

 After discussions with experts, the board has come to the conclusion that short-answer type questions should be introduced from next year, N.R. Banerjea, the board chairman and the vice-chancellor of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu), announced on Tuesday. 

 Students will be required to answer the short questions in two to three sentences.

 Though Banerjea did not explain the reason for the change in the question paper pattern, sources in the higher education department said the move was aimed at minimising the risk of malpractice.

 The need to incorporate changes in the examination system became apparent after some people were found to be rigging the system and selling medical seats at a premium to undeserving candidates. 

 With police investigations revealing that the MCQ pattern had made it easier for the dummy candidates to crack the test, the council had to revise the process.

 Most other states follow the MCQ pattern. So, it is easier for dummy candidates from other states to operate here. As students need to merely tick the right answer, there is no scope of checking the hand writing, said a higher education department official stressing the need to develop a foolproof system.

 The board has also decided to redesign examination forms and admit cards. A rigorous process will be put in place to verify the residential proof of each examinee.

 We have five committees working to examine how the system can be made foolproof. The committees will take their decisions after consulting the police, Banerjea said.

 The board has also made 50 per cent marks in physics, chemistry and mathematics at the plus-two level mandatory for admission in engineering colleges.

 The board chairman did have some good news for examinees, though. From 2008, the ceiling of a maximum of three attempts will be done away with and students above 17 years can appear for the exam as many times as they want till they turn 24.

 The next JEE will be held on April 27, 2008.

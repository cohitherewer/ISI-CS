 Woman held for swindle

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Heema Trivedi, co-owner of an all-woman non-banking finance firm, was arrested on Wednesday on charges of duping thousands of depositors.

 The alleged victims had deposited money in the Bhowanipore-based company, Saheli, lured by its promise of stupendous returns. 

 Against a one-time deposit of Rs 2,000, the company had promised a return of Rs 1,000 a month for eight months. The first instalment would be paid four months after the deposit.

 Heema was picked up from office following a complaint by a depositor, who had alleged that she did not get back money as stated in the agreement.

 The agreement was absurd. It was a bait and the depositors fell for it, said Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters). Had anyone given a second thought to the terms and conditions, the owners would have been exposed.

 Heema and other two women had set up Saheli eight months ago on Mohini Mohan Road. 

 The three had announced that their goal was to make women independent. They also made it clear that only women could deposit money in their company, deputy commissioner Chatterjee added.

 Within months, the number of investors reached nearly 10,000 and the amount they together put in had crossed Rs 2 crore.

 Initially, a few depositors were refunded money according to the terms in the agreement. But the company stopped repayment in a couple of months. Faced by persistent queries from the depositors, the trio kept saying that all dues would soon be repaid, said an officer of Bhowanipore police station.

 Sensing something was wrong, one of the depositors, Kanchan Singh, lodged a complaint with police. We raided the office and arrested Heema. Another owner gave us the slip, as she left office minutes before we went there, the officer added. A search is on for the other co-owners.

 Heema has been reman-ded in police custody till February 21.

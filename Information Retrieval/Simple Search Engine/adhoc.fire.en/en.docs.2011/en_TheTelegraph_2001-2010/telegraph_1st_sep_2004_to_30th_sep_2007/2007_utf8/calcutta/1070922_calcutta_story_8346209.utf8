 Girl falls off bus

 - Accident spate on city streets 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 15-year-old girl fell off a private bus when it started moving before she could step down from the footboard on Friday morning. Tanushree Das, who was injured in the head, told police that one of the conductors had signalled the driver to move while she was getting off the bus on route 34B.

 Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), claimed no action could be taken against the conductor as Tanushree did not blame him for the fall. She merely narrated what had happened on the bus.

 Witnesses to the incident at the crossing of Bidhan Sarani and Vivekananda Road chased the bus for some distance, but failed to stop it.

 Tanushree, a Class IX student, boarded the bus at Dunlop, where she lives, on her way to school. 

 I was about to get down when the bus stopped at the Bidhan Sarani-Vivekananda Road crossing. I just put out my right leg when the conductor pressed the bell, asking the driver to move. My left leg was still on the footboard, Tanushree told officers of Girish Park police station.

 She lost her balance and fell to the ground, sustaining injuries in the head. Bystanders rushed her to Medical College and Hospital, where she underwent a CT scan.

 Pool car mishap: Three children, aged between four and eight years, and the driver of a Sumo they were travelling in were injured when the vehicle lost control and overturned after hitting a road-divider in Rajarhat on Friday morning.

 The pool car was carrying 10 students of Delhi Public School Megacity.

 Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas), said the driver will be grilled after he recovers.

 We heard a bang and our car overturned. Local people came to our rescue, said Disha Khandelwal, one of the injured children. 

 The school authorities refused to comment as the car did not belong to them.

 Other mishaps: Ramprasad Sahani, a taxi driver, was crushed to death under the wheels of a Sumo. Sahani was sleeping on the pavement when he was run over by the car. 

 Samir Sen, 70, was injured when a tram hit him on Deshapran Sashmal Road, near Tollygunge post office. Mumtaz Khan and Kaiser Khan were injured after being knocked down by a truck on Transport Depot Road, in Taratala.

 Rina Das, 25, was injured when a Sumo hit the two-wheeler she was riding on with her brother on Rashbehari Avenue.

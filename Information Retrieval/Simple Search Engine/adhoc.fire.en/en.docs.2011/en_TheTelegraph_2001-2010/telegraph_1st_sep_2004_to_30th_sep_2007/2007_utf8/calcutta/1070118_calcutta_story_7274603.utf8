Five young girls from Calcutta along with 79 fellow students of Pune-based Sadhana Centre for Management and Leadership Development set a new benchmark on January 14 by memorising and recollecting over 250 random objects in a correct sequence.

 Rashi Mohta, Deboshree Roy, Namrata Daga, Jyoti Mohta and Priyam Kabra participated in the event called Salam Kalam, in honour of President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. The attempt was a tribute to the qualities Kalam wants youngsters to imbibe.

 The students have broken the current record of 225 random objects recalled and have registered their claim with The Guinness Book of World Records under the category of the largest number of objects recalled.

 The memory test was conducted under set international guidelines with strict monitoring by specially-appointed invigilators. V.V.R. Murty, marketing manager, Limca Book of Records, was present during the event and monitored the proceedings.

 The students achieved the feat after three months of gruelling practise sessions that involved learning a special technique of memorising with high efficiency. Some of the students can now recall even 500 objects.

 The technique involves a new language of memory, which hinges on the students ability to imagine, visualise and use creativity.

 P. Mahadevan, visiting faculty and a human resources professional, developed the special technique to train the students. The praiseworthy attempt by the youngsters goes on to prove that it is possible to motivate and train students to achieve goals on a par with international standards.

 We practised rigorously for three months and Professor Mahadevan helped us a lot, said Priyam Kabra.

 I am extremely proud of my daughter. All the students who broke the record deserve kudos, as do the teachers who showed confidence in them and trained them to achieve this feat, said Ram Mohta, father of Rashi, one of the Calcutta girls who was successful in breaking the record.

 Jaikishen Daga said about his daughter Namrata who was another participant: She always had it in her. She could memorise things quite well since childhood.

 Back to school

 Remembered joys are never past. They were, they are, they shall be! For the old boys of Birla High School, it was school life ldquo;lived all over again rdquo; at the annual reunion of the school recently. 

 They assembled for the school prayer to be followed by an evening of fun, frolic, food, fiesta, friendly bear hugs and fond memories.

 Alumnus Amit Fuhaar, fondly known as Sandeep Agarwal to his batchmates, treated the boys to a mimicry performance. The crowd danced to some electrifying numbers of Dhwani. The programme culminated with a lucky draw and a sumptuous dinner. 

 A webcasting of the entire programme ensured that those who could not make it to the reunion did not feel left out. Each alumni member was presented with a memento and a copy of the BHS Alumni rsquo;s annual magazine Setu.

 Media mire

 Bhavan rsquo;s College of Communication amp; Management, Salt Lake, hosted a daylong seminar on ldquo;Media at the Crossroads rdquo; on January 14.

 The speakers expressed their concern over the constant pressure that media faces from the advertisers and warned that ldquo;the days of sponsored editorials are not far away rdquo;. 

 In the first business session, Snehasis Sur of Doordarshan explained through a PowerPoint presentation the conflict between media rsquo;s role to do social good and news becoming a consumer product.

 In the post-lunch session, Krishna Dhar accused the general people of being too insensitive to tragic incidents. He said: ldquo;Even war has become entertainment for people. rdquo; Supriyo Routh of National University of Juridical Sciences then talked at length about ldquo;The RTI Act and its implementation rdquo;. 

 The third business session ended with the students rsquo; feedback.

 Poetry paper

 Kalamanjari Howrah held a three-day lecture and workshop series on Paper II ndash; Poetry, especially oriented for the English honours students of Calcutta University, at Charukala Bhavan in end-December.

 The programme flagged off with an introductory speech by Rai Kamal Dasgupta, head of the English department of Ashutosh College. Then there were lectures on Shakespearean sonnets, with special focus on sonnet 18 by Suman Chakraborty. Nilay Agambagis then presented an unconventional approach towards John Donne rsquo;s The Good Morrow. The young learners had the opportunity to clear their doubts on the topic at a question hour. 

 Day Two started with Chakraborty discussing the themes and meanings that Shakespeare would like his readers to decipher in his sonnets 73 and 116. There was a workshop on writing answers on questions based on Shakespearean sonnets. Computer presentations were made to illustrate various facets of Shakespearean themes.

 Day Three sparked off with a talk on Blake rsquo;s Tyger and Lamb by Chakraborty, followed by a discussion by Chakraborty and Agambagis on the ways to tackle literary terms in the CU syllabus.

 The experts advised that students preparing for the BA Part I (new syllabus) and BA Part II (new syllabus) examinations should emphasise on good introductions and conclusions. There is no compulsion to state the critic rsquo;s comments using ellipses. The students can frame it in their own language.

 Line of no control: The mark to delineate the space allotted for hawkers 

 It is amazing that the state government is issuing identity cards to hawkers despite mishaps due to lack of space on the footpaths. Scant regard is being shown to the shop-owners who would now find their store fronts blocked by encroachers. 

 Hawkers with identity cards will rule not only the major roads, but the streets, lanes and bylanes. It goes without saying that the thin white line that is supposed to demarcate the hawker and pedestrian zones on the pavements will barely be visible, if at all. And we will wait fruitlessly for officials to hit the roads with tapes to ensure that there is no hawker within 50 ft of intersections. 

 The Left Front had earlier tried to violate the rights of house-owners by legalising graffiti. Pandering to collectivism has been a hallmark of communists the world over throughout history. 

 Our communists may wear dhotis instead of high-necked coats and caps with red stars, but the fundamentalist mindset that George Orwell described so well remains unchanged. The communists provide muscle power to the semi-educated so that they can trample on individual rights and make the partys power absolute. 

 Amit Banerjee,

 Apropos the report Tagore to soothe moods, nerves, November 23, it is appreciable that psychologists and surgeons are using Rabindrasangeet for music therapy. Tagores songs indeed have a palliative effect and relieve the sufferings of patients. Some banks have recently started playing Rabindrasangeet to keep employees engaged in monotonous work in good spirits. 

 Govinda Bakshi,

 Budge Budge 

 The idea of using Rabindrasangeet to treat depression is brilliant. Tagores numbers act as balm for the wounded soul and inspire people to take on the world with renewed vigour.

 Apropos the report Crater claims life, November 22, the pothole on the road, and certainly not the Matador, was responsible for the death of six-year-old Unzruna. If she had not been thrown off the rickshaw as it fell into the pothole, she would not have been run over. Even a vehicle moving slowly could not have avoided the mishap. Contractors and engineers benefit from poor roads; everyone else pays for them. Its time the government did something more than issuing statements. 

 Chandan Ray,

 Sarsuna 

 The negligence of the government has claimed yet another life on the road. No concrete effort has been made by the government to fix the pothole problem. The citizens are forced to pay exorbitant taxes though the condition of the pathways is deteriorating steadily. The government should take care of the basics before becoming busy in building flyovers. 

 Mahelaka Begum,

 AJC Bose Road 

 Apropos the report Pills to party, risks be damned, November 29, it is disheartening that after a hard days work young people are trying to relax by attending parties and nightclubs. Party drugs being peddled freely in Park Circus, Ripon Street and Free School Street. The pills affect the nervous system, raise blood pressure and heartbeat, and could well prove fatal. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park 

 The blaze at the leather factory in Topsia proved devastating because there was no safety arrangement in place (Fire mocks rescue cries, November 23). Every time such a fire claims lives, the government makes the right noises but ignores its responsibilities. The labour department should immediately start a survey of illegal factories in the state. And having failed to ban child labour, the worker-friendly Left Front should at least try to protect the labourers from exploitation. 

 A.F. Kamruddin,

 Chandbati, Hooghly 

 Lives were lost due to the governments failure to take precautionary measures in fire-prone zones (Scant regard for tinderbox alert, November 27). Unfortunately, in this part of the world, remedial measures are taken after mishaps. Illegal factories must be shut down and fire stations set up in every zone. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala 

 Apropos the report A rape every 38 minutes, November 27, it is alarming that atrocities against women are on the rise throughout the country. People guilty of crimes like bride-burning, rape, molestation and eve-teasing often get away scot free. The judiciary should ensure that they are given exemplary punishment. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia

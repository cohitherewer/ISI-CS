 Committee on college union poll

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The governing body of Presidency College on Wednesday set up a five-member committee to examine the SFIs demand for a re-poll in two seats in the students union elections.

 The panel will submit its report to the state government on Thursday morning, said college officials. The higher education department runs the college. It will decide whether there will be a re-poll or not. 

 The results of the students union election were announced on February 27. Independent Consolidation (IC) was re-elected after bagging a handful of seats more than SFI.

 The SFI and AIDSO candidates secured the same number of votes in two seats in the postgraduate I constituency. 

 The SFI had alleged that evening that IC had brought in false voters in the constituency.

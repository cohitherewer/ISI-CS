 Craters waiting to cause mishaps

 - South Calcutta streets in perilous shape after being drowned and damaged

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Potholes, craters and stone chips that is the sad song of the road in south Calcutta, a week after the downpour that first drowned and then damaged the streets.

 As soon as you get off the Gariahat flyover and hit Gol Park, a large pothole forces you to slam the brakes. Vehicles come down the flyover at high speed, especially at night. An accident can occur any day, says Montu Das, a resident of Dhakuria. 

 A relatively smooth ride till Jadavpur police station ends abruptly in another crater right in the middle of the thoroughfare.

 This is an accident-prone crossing. And this pothole in the middle of the road makes the chaotic crossing even more perilous, says a sergeant struggling to manage the sudden surge in traffic ever since the Bypass connector was thrown open.

 A right turn into Prince Anwar Shah Road from Jadavpur police station spells a car crawl due to a combination of craters and congestion.

 Further south, just outside the Tollygunge Club gate, is a gaping pothole filled with water. This crater is so deep that it renders half this crucial road off-limits. Peak-hour traffic here is one loud snarl.

 According to officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), responsible for upkeep of the roads, work on righting the wrongs is underway in the boardroom.

 We have already started preparing the list of roads that have been damaged by the rain and the waterlogging last week. We are waiting for the roads to dry up completely before we start the repair work. If the sun keeps shining this week, the patchwork should start, said Tuhin Bera, the mayoral council member (roads).

 Back on the streets, Rashbehari Avenue, one of the prime arteries in the south, is host to a dangerous ditch near the Gariahat junction that slows down traffic, yet again.

 Next, a drive along Hazra Road towards Alipore bears the scars of shoddy repairs. The tram tracks on Hazra Road are in particularly poor shape.

 Even the plush avenues of Alipore are not immune to pothole peril. Many cars turning into Belvedere Road are stopped in their tracks by a crater.

 We have tried to bring this to the attention of the CMC, but there has been no response. At night, when practically none of the streetlights are on and the road is so potholed, its a miracle that no major accident has taken place, said a resident of the area.

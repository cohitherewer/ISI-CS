The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Waterworld woes across city

 - FLOODED CANALS, CONTAMINATED PIPELINES

 It barely rained on Tuesday, but the water just refused to recede in several parts of the city. Metro waded through some waterlogged pockets...

 North Calcutta 

 Kankurgachhi and Ultadanga resembled a large pond, punctuated by vehicles that had broken down from small cars to state buses. Bangur Avenue was among the worst hit, with water entering all ground-floor homes, drinking water getting contaminated and no electricity for hours.

 The authorities say both Bagjola and Kestopur canals are flooded, so they cannot pump out the water. The water level is rising here, cried Balak Manhersaria, a resident of Bangur on the protest path.

 It was no different in Paikpara or on Amherst Street, both under waist-deep water. With the Thanthania Kalibari flooded and the pumping station unable to take the load, there was no respite in sight for residents. Parts of College Street were also submerged.

 Salt Lake - Rajarhat 

 In Salt Lake, which had gone under water like never before on Monday, wards 4 and 19 were the worst hit the day after the downpour. In Duttabad, more than 150 families had to be evacuated. We will have to draw up a master plan so that we can get rid of this problem, once and for all. This will require a lot of funds, said Bidhannagar Municipality chairman Biswajiban Majumdar, adding that the township has only one drainage pumping station.

 In New Town, residents of several new housing estates were marooned in waist-deep water. Here, too, the municipality officials blamed it on the Bagjola and Kestopur canals being flooded.

 South Calcutta 

 Swinhoe Street, Jamir Lane and Cornfield Road, near Gariahat, Jodhpur Park, Lake Gardens and Golf Green, Naktala and Bansdroni were all under knee-deep water till late on Tuesday.

 Residents complained of waterlogging woes ranging from depleted stock (as all markets in the locality were shut), frequent power cuts, absence of domestics and phones going dead. In the past 27 years, I have never seen waterlogging like this, said a resident of Jodhpur Park.

 Behala

 Jaya Chakraborty, a student of Class VII, sat on the window sill of her submerged ground-floor home in Adarshanagar (East).

 Manoranjan Pal, a 79-year-old resident of Adarshanagar (West), has been confined to his bed from Monday, in a room filled with knee-deep water. Families in Kshudiram Pally, Green Park, Basundhara Park, Adarshanagar, Hemanta Mukherjee Road, Subhas Marg, Airport Road, Pallisree, Anandanagar, Joyrampur and Dakshin Behala Road were similarly marooned.

 It will take time for the water to recede, as the Begor, Moni, Charial and Suti canals are overflowing, said Sovan Chatterjee, the chairman of Borough XIV of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

 Howrah

 Even 20 hours after the rain had stopped, at least 10 wards in the Howrah Municipal Corporation area remained under water. The large iron market at Ghusuri had to be closed because of waterlogging on Girish Ghosh Road.

 In many residential areas, water had invaded the ground floors. Mayor Gopal Mukherjee said: Water is not receding despite eight pumping machines being pressed into service as the river is in spate.

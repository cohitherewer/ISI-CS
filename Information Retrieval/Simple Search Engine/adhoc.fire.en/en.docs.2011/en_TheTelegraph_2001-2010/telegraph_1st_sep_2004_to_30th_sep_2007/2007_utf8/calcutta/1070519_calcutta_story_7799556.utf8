The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cellphone lost in airport X-ray zone 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An executive lost his mobile phone at Calcutta airports security-check counter last week, months after a techie lost his laptop and a medical student her phone.

 Darshan H. Sheth, assistant vice-president of Senco Gold Pvt Ltd, lost his N70M set (IMEI no. 351863015451913) to the X-ray machine while travelling from Calcutta to Guwahati on an Indian flight on May 10.

 The flight was to take off at 9.50am, but got delayed by an hour, Sheth said. He arrived at the security-check counter around 10.30am.

 The CISF men at the counter asked him to deposit his mobile phone on a tray for an X-ray scan. When he returned to the counter after the security check, the phone was missing from the tray. An old phone was there in place of mine, he recalled. Sheth alleged that the CISF men not only failed to provide any clue about his phone, but refused to register a complaint.

 I could not press the matter then as my flight was about to take off, but I lodged a complaint in Guwahati. On my return to Calcutta on May 15, I took up the matter again with the CISF, Sheth said.

 This time, he was shown the feed from a closed-circuit camera placed near the security-check counter.

 But the camera was positioned in a way that the view was obstructed by a pillar, he alleged. Later, he filed a complaint with the airport manager in Calcutta.

 Its a rare case. Several mobile phones get lost and are deposited with the manager, said a CISF officer.

 On March 14, the mobile phone of a medical student from Dibrugarh was stolen from the airport. It was later found in a toilet at Dibrugarh airport. On March 2, Judhajit Sen Majumdar, an IT professional, lost his laptop before boarding a Bangalore flight.

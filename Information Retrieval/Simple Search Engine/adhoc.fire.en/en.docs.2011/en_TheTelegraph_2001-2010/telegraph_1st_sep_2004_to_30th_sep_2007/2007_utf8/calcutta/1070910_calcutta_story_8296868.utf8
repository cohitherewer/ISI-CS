The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Youths body found in UP

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Fazlur Rahman, who was found dead in Uttar Pradesh

 Fazlur Rahman alias Jahangir, a 28-year-old loan recovery agent and political worker from Kidderpore, was found dead beside railway tracks at Shikohabad, in Uttar Pradesh, on Saturday.

 Jahangir was missing from September 6 along with local rowdy Chikna Raju, who was also a loan recovery agent. Raju and Jahangir were friends but had recently parted ways.

 The body was found lying beside the tracks about three km from the Shikohabad railway station in the afternoon. There were multiple injuries on his head, chest and legs. His hands were fractured. He might have fallen off or thrown out of a moving train, S.K. Chowdhury, the investigating officer of Shikohabad police station, told Metro. Shikohabad is in Firozabad district.

 The police found a phone diary in Jahangirs pocket and called up the numbers in it. Thats how we got to know that he was from Calcutta. There seems to be foul play behind the death. There was a cut on the head. We are waiting for the post-mortem report, which will be available on Monday, added Chowdhury.

 Jahangir lived with his parents and three brothers at 18/1 Maulana Mohammad Ali Road. Tension prevailed in the locality after news of his death spread. We are sure that my brother was murdered. Its a mystery how he had reached Uttar Pradesh. We have not broken the news to my ailing parents, said Altaf, Jahangirs younger brother. 

 Their father Habibur Rahman lodged a missing diary with Ekbalpore police station on Saturday evening.

 Jahangir had been involved with several political parties, including Forward Bloc and Congress. He was an active worker of Trinamul Congress, said an officer of Ekbalpore police station. 

 Weve detained some local youths close to Raju to find out whether he was involved in the death. His family could not tell us about his whereabouts, the officer added .

 Shamima Rehan Khan, the local Forward Bloc councillor, said six people from the locality have left for Shikohabad to bring back the body.

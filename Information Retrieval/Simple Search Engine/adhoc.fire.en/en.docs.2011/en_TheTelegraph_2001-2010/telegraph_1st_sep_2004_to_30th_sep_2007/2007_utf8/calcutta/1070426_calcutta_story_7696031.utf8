 A cooperative society started by a handful of Sonagachhi residents has taken banking services to the doorsteps of sex workers across the state.

 Usha Multipurpose Cooperative Society (UMCS), launched under the aegis of NGO Durbar Mahila Samity in 1995, now has six branches and 8,500 account-holders, all of them sex workers. We are planning to open branches in more red-light areas, said Pratima Das, a sex worker from Bowbazar and current president of UMCS.

 The annual turnover of the bank, which is in the process of digitising operations, is about Rs 9 crore. Daily deposits touch Rs 45,000. 

 The bank of the sex workers, by the sex workers and for the sex workers doesnt have stringent rules. No identity proof is required to open an account. The initial deposit can be as low as Rs 15. The daily collection scheme is the most popular, revealed Shantanu Chatterjee, in charge of the credit division of UMCS. 

 A group of 13 sex workers started the bank on the Samitys premises at 12/5 Nilmoni Mitra Street, in Sonagachhi. While conducting a survey in Sonagachhi, I found that economic insecurity forced sex workers to entertain clients who refused to use protection. Most of the sex workers didnt have a savings plan and were often harassed by goons, recounted Smarajit Jana, the brains behind the Samity.

 After being duped by con men, we were initially apprehensive about UMCS. But the members of the society explained the benefits of investing our hard-earned money, said Mamata Nandi, a sex worker from Sonagachhi. 

 Gauri Das, president of the Samity, said: Initially, the public relations officer had to try and convince the sex workers to deposit money in the bank. If we spoke to 100 women, only two would open accounts. Gradually, they understood that the bank was trying to help them. 

 The bank has sanctioned loans of up to Rs 15 lakh, often to sex workers who wanted to start businesses. Financial independence has made us stronger. We now refuse clients who are not willing to use protection, said an account-holder.

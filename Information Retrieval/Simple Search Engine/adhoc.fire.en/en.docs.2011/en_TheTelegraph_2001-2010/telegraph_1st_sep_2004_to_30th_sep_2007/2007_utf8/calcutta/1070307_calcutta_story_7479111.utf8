 TB tentacles spread beyond lungs

 - EXTERNAL FACTORS PUSHING DOWN OVERALL IMMUNITY LEVELS

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Manoj Sharma (name changed on request), 32, was complaining of a dry cough for three months, along with loss of appetite and weight. He was also having fever in the evening regularly.

 After initial examinations, doctors suspected Sharma was suffering from cancer in the thymus gland and advised surgery and chemotherapy. 

 But his clinical and metabolic profile suggested tuberculosis (TB) in the gland (located below the thyroid in the lower neck), which was later confirmed by biopsy reports.

 A 55-year-old man complained of fever and shortness of breath. Examinations revealed the functioning of the heart was being hampered because of fluid accumulation within the covering. TB germs were later found in the fluid.

 Doctors said there has been a spurt in the incidence of tuberculosis in parts of body other than the lungs and bones, which were earlier not very common. In Calcutta, TB germs have been detected in the thymus gland, arm muscles, spleen, heart and even the brain.

 Use of steroid and immuno-suppressive drugs, morphological change in TB germs and the rise in the number of AIDS and diabetic patients are some of the causes for the occurrence of the disease in organs and glands.

 TB is now no longer a disease of the poor. We are getting patients from the affluent section of society, said Milan Chetri, consultant in internal medicine, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Calcutta. The overall immunity level is going down because of various external factors and this is pushing up the number of TB cases.

 The incidence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis caused by bacteria resistant to at least two of the most widely-used medicines has been steadily rising. Patients affected with such bacteria are extremely difficult to treat. Therapy may continue for up to two years, compared to the standard regimen of six months, Chetri pointed out.

 Disseminated tuberculosis, involving any organ of the body, is on the rise, confirmed critical care expert Subrata Maitra. One reason is the administration of immuno-suppressive drugs to patients undergoing organ transplants, especially renal transplants, he pointed out.

 The rise in diabetic cases is another factor, Maitra stressed. Diabetes brings down the immunity level of the body, making the patient susceptible to TB infection.

 Doctors have also observed emergence of TB cases in those having vegetarian diet. In many cases, it has been observed that people are not following proper chart while having a vegetarian diet. As a result, the intake of protein goes down and so does the immunity level.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mystery law makes it worse

 If there are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways can result in a catastrophe, then someone will do it, said Edward A. Murphy Jr., an American aerospace engineer and eternal pessimist and became the author of one of the most strongly believed hypotheses in the world: Murphys Law. Put more simply, it means: Things will go wrong in any given situation, if you give them a chance. Put even more simply, it is: Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong. At the worst possible time. 

 Its a dark way of looking at life and though invented in the West, finds much acceptance all over the world. How does it work or doesnt work in the city? 

 It comes most into focus rather, doesnt at the time of power-cuts. Which is happening so much this summer. How do you explain a power-cut exactly on the day its blazing hot, and just when you are getting ready to go to work? asks Sohini Dutt, 24, an assistant designer. 

 Murphys law seems partial to public transport in the city. 

 It happens all the time in Metro. The Kalighat Metro Station has more than three ticket counters open at peak hours. What are the chances of the counter you decide on of having the longest queue? Or is the queue moving the slowest? Is that the one where the machine gets stuck? When will you realise that you do not have change and the man behind you isnt that obliging? When you have changed one queue, the one that you have left starts moving faster. 

 One of the situations is bound to happen, says medical student Ishani De. Whenever Im just in time for a train and the queue is short, I realise that Ive got a Rs 100 note on me and the lady at the counter snarls and I invariably miss the train. 

 It happens all the time with taxis. When you want to go to Salt Lake, no taxi will take you there and it starts to rain. In fact, Calcutta taxis will hardly ever agree to take you where you want to go and perhaps theres more than Murphys at work there.

 It happens all the time with buses. The day Im running late, the buses will decide to go slower, says Amrita Majumdar, a college student. And every Salt Lake resident knows about S-19. As soon as you reach the bus stop, you see the disappearing back of a bus no one has to tell you which one it was. 

 How about shopping? Says Aditi Paul, a research analyst: If Im out window-shopping, Im bound to see all the clothes Id love to buy. But if I come back the very next day armed with cash, theyll have disappeared. 

 Murphys law affects food. Says Pradipta Sarkar, a Jadavpur University student: Somebody always buys the last piece of Chocolate Excess at Caf Coffee Day just when Im about to reach the counter. 

 However, if Murphys law doesnt always work out for you, try considering the Sivermans paradox: If Murphys Law can go wrong, it will. If you arent that optimistic, try using Murphys first corollary: Whenever you set out to do something, something else must be done first.

 But you know it isnt as accurate as Murphys law when you go out armed with a towering umbrella and a huge raincoat on a blazing June day, but theres no rain.

 Deepa Mehtas film Water 

 is creating ripples in the virtual world.

 Pramod Sharma (http://pramodworld.blogspot.com/) 

 feels that the movie has finally got its recognition. 

 He writes: Water is in the Top 5 in the Oscar race 

 now At Oscars, they dont want to see big sets, Indian 

 culture or Indian scenes, all that matters is an appealing 

 story in a sensible package. Paheli, the movie which 

 was not accepted in India also, how could they expect it 

 to be accepted outside? Hope the censor board gets some 

 brain(s) to at least understand the nature of Oscar-deserving 

 cinema.

 In a blog titled Prediction vs 

 My Choices, 46-year-old Michael (http://allaboutoscar.blogspot.com/) 

 writes: Okay Im ready to make some predictions. Ive got 

 like a month to change my mind, but to be honest I think 

 these are pretty sure winners. But as many of us do, we 

 prefer other people and movies to win rather than the favourites, 

 or the sure thing. So I will list my predictions and the 

 why behind my choice...

 The predictions: The Departed 

 for the Best Picture and Best Director (Martin 

 Scorsese); Forest Whitaker for Best Actor because Whitaker 

 is pure evil and pure perfection in this role; Helen Mirren 

 for Best Actress; Eddie Murphy for Supporting Actor and 

 Jennifer Hudson for Supporting Actress.

 Kenji Fujishima (http://mylife24fps.blogspot.com/) 

 feels that overall this years Oscar noms pretty much 

 stayed on the dull, unadventurous side of the fence, especially 

 with its Best Picture nods.

 He explains how this years frontrunner 

 Babel is undoubtedly superior to last years pernicious 

 multi-narrative Oscar winner Crash.

 If you arent interested in the 

 films, you could always play a little fashion game of who 

 will wear what to the Oscars. Thomas (http://thomaslindaman.blogspot.com/) 

 blogs: Were in the middle of what is called award 

 season... And each award show tries to be more glamorous 

 than the last We get stories about the Oscars a week or 

 two prior to the event, about whos wearing what, whos 

 throwing after-parties, how local folks celebrate the Oscars, 

 how to throw an Oscar party...

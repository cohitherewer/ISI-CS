The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Taxi driver returns Rs 42,000

 A STAFF REPORTER

 HONEST CABBIE: Driver Haru Sardar. A Telegraph picture

 I do not want any reward. But I will be grateful if you help in the treatment of my ailing mother.

 This was all taxi driver Haru Sardar had to say when a councillor offered to reward him for returning Rs 42,000 that two passengers had left behind in his vehicle.

 Somnath Mishra, a resident of Mukundapur, hired Sardars taxi on Thursday to go to Baranagar. With him was Bikash Banerjee, a cardiac patient from Ragunathpur, in Murshidabad, who had been admitted to Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences in Mukundapur.

 Mishra was accompanying Banerjee after his release to a relatives house. They got off the taxi without the bag containing the money. 

 Soon after, another passenger took the taxi to Tallah Park. After he got off, Sardar got down to dust the car. He saw the bag lying near a rear window. 

 Out of curiosity, I opened the bag and found the money inside. But I could not figure out who had left it behind. So I came to the taxi stand in Mukundapur and deposited the money at the union office, said Sardar.

 Within minutes, Mishra came to the taxi union office to ask if any of the drivers had deposited the money. He was asked to come back on Friday and collect the money after proving that it was his.

 The union officials then contacted Samarendra Roy, the chairman of the local borough of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, and told him of the incident. On Thursday, both Mishra and Sardar reached the office. After Mishra produced the necessary papers, the money was handed over to him by Roy. 

 When Roy wanted to reward Sardar, he only asked him to make arrangements for the treatment of his 72-year-old mother Malati, who has been ill for a long time. 

 We were very pleased to hear him and have decided to offer help, so that he can look after his mother properly, said Roy.

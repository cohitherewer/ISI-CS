 Lone Rangers: Roadside trees that form part of the citys receding greenery 

 Apropos the report Census to save trees, December 22, it is heartening that the state forest department and the civic body have chalked out a plan to take care of the roadside trees. Given that greenery and wildlife in and around the city are dwindling, the civic body and the government should strive to preserve whatever little is left. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 Buses plying along VIP Road towards Ultadanga move at a snails pace between the airport and Kestopur (Buses race to fatal end, December 22). The drivers stop the buses in such a manner that other vehicles cannot overtake them. But after crossing Kestopur, they start driving recklessly. The only way out is abolition of commission-based payment to drivers and conductors. 

 Debabrata Paul,

 VIP Road. 

 Theres a bus accident every day, but nothing is done to prevent them. Police must be asked to explain their inaction. Why dont the passengers force the buses to stop? 

 Shiv Shanker Almal, 

 Lower Rawdon Street. 

 Apropos the report Monitor bodies a must, December 21, the principals of missionary schools have done a wonderful job for over a century. The need to seek approval of a managing committee at every step might delay their decision-making process. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

 Apropos the report Women to check cell smut, December 30, the argument of the Criminal Investigation Department that people who tease women on cellphone get SIM cards using fake identity proof seems illogical. Why arent the service providers being pulled up? Those who abide by the law are the ones harassed at every step. When they submit official forms, even minor spelling disparities are not tolerated by the administration. But criminals can procure cellphones without any problem. 

 Tapan Pal,

 Batanagar. 

 It is shocking that malls in the city are stocking items of dubious quality (Spurious items under scan, December 28). Action on the basis of complaints by consumers is seldom taken on time. Products whether imported or locally produced need to bear a certificate of quality. A heavy penalty should be imposed for such offences to protect the consumers. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 A flyover is needed over the Park Street-Mullickbazar crossing (New decongest duo, December 18). It should be extended to the AJC Bose Road flyover instead of building an exit ramp on it. Otherwise, the traffic using the ramp will get stuck at the Shakespeare Sarani crossing. 

 Rupnarayan Bose,

 Salt Lake.

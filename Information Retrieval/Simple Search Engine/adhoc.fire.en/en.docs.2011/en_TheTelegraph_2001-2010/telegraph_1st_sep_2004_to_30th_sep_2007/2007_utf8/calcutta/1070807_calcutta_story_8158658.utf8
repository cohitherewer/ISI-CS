 Kin pin hope on justice

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Seventeen-year-old Arani Chakraborty returned home from school on Monday evening, only to learn that his father may be behind bars again.

 The peace in the Chakraborty household, restored in March after eight long years, lies shattered once more.

 The high court on Monday ordered Aranis father Lakshmi Narayan, 52, acquitted of the charge of murdering the Pals, his next-door neighbours, to surrender in the trial court within seven days. Failure to surrender will lead to the schoolteachers arrest, the court ruled.

 Chakrabortys wife Kalpana, however, seemed to be confident that the high court would finally uphold the acquittal order.

 We will get justice again. The Alipore courts verdict proved that my husband was innocent, said Kalpana, who learnt about the high court order from TV channels.

 Chakraborty was not available for comment, having left home in the morning for his tutorial classes. Kalpana had no clue when he would return.

 He left home after breakfast. He was supposed to come in the afternoon for lunch but did not turn up. All my attempts to contact him failed, said Kalpana.

 The couple will decide their course of action after consulting their lawyers.

 Kalpana, in her 40s, recalled how life returned to normal after the trial court acquitted her husband of the murder charge.

 The small garden in front of our house is my husbands creation. He also placed those flower pots on the roof and tended to them regularly. We were happy again after a long time, but the respite was brief. Todays order has revived those dark days, she said.

 Neighbours said they knew about Chakrabortys affair with Sohini, the elder daughter of the Pal family. Kalpana often complained to us about the affair. But we could never imagine that it might trigger such a ghastly crime, said Amit Munshi, a neighbour who has been living in Oxytown for the past 20 years.

 The chargesheet against Chakraborty had also mentioned the affair. Police had claimed that Sohini became pregnant and pleaded with Chakraborty to marry her.

 But the teacher refused, following which his relationship with the Pals soured. The prosecution claimed that on June 9, 1999, Chakraborty had offered the Pals tea laced with Nitravate, a sedative, following which they lost consciousness.

 A contract killer, Chandan Das, then allegedly entered the house and killed the Pals.

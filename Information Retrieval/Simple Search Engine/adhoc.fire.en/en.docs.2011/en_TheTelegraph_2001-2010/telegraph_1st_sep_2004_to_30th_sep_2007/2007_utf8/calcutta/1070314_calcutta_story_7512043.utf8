 Abhirup Dutta will not have to waste a year to appear for the Higher Secondary (HS) examination. The Class XII student of Jodhpur Boys School learnt the good news on Tuesday afternoon, as the high court upheld his plea and allowed him to write the test, starting this Friday. 

 As Abhirup had failed to fulfil the attendance requirement 70 per cent of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education, his name did not figure on the list of examinees of the south Calcutta school. 

 But a division bench of the high court, comprising Justice P.K. Roy and Justice T. Giri, passed an interim order and directed the council to issue an admit card to Abhirup. 

 The students father will go to the school tomorrow and fill up the form. The school authorities are directed to send the form to the council the same day. The council is directed to issue an admit card to the student by Thursday, said the division bench. 

 According to his parents, Abhirup was ill in early 2006 and missed classes for a long period and so, his attendance was 65 per cent, five per cent below the stipulated norms. But he managed a Grade B 45 to 59 per cent marks in the test and pre-test. 

 Despite knowing about his illness, the school authorities did not forward my sons name to the council and he was not issued an admit card. As our repeated appeals fell on deaf ears, we had to move court, said Tapan Dutta, Abhirups father. 

 He pointed out that most of the students and their parents were not aware of the attendance criteria. 

 The session for Class XII started in April 2006. But we learnt later that the council had issued the circular on October 19, Dutta added.

 The council, however, maintained that the attendance rule was nothing new. 

 We had only added that students will have to attend 70 per cent classes both in Class XI and Class XII, said Debasish Sarkar, secretary of the HS council.

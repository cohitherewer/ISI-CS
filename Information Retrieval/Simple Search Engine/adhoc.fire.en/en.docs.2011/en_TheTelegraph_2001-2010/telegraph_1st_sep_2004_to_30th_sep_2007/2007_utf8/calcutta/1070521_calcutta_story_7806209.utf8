 Kingpin of dacoity on train held

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Sailendra Singh and his associates Satyendra and Dhananjoy were arrested outside a cinema in the heart of Patna on Saturday for the Rs 99-lakh dacoity on the Geetanjali Express in July 2005.

 Sailendra, in his early 40s, masterminded the dacoity, which was carried out by a 12-member gang as the Mumbai-bound train was entering Jhargram. The dacoits robbed the passengers in two compartments, before getting off the train by pulling the chain. 

 A few months ago, Sailendra was involved in a dacoity at a nationalised bank in Chapra. The gang members walked away with Rs 10 lakh after shooting a man waiting outside the bank, said a senior officer of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

 We obtained a lead about Sailendras whereabouts while probing a murder in Howrah, said another CID officer.

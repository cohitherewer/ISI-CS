 Finance minister P. Chidambaram wooed pet-lovers by slashing import duty on pet foods by 10 per cent on budget day. The announcement was greeted with catcalls and barks in political circles. Enough for Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee to ask the howling Opposition members: Dont you like dogs?

 Pet households across the city, though, are resonating with happy meows and woofs. With quality pet food set to become cheaper, sale of pet food is sure to rise. Says Shantanu Mitra, owner of Paws, the pet care shop on Ballygunge Circular Road: This is good news for pet-owners but even better news for pets, who will now get more of quality food.

 Metro ran this by some pet-owners in town:

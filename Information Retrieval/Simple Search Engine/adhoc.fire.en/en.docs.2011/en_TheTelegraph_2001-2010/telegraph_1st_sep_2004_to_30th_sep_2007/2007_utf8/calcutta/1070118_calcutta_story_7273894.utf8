 Fusion choreography

 Ananda Shankar Centre for Performing Arts, in association with US Consulate General, Calcutta and American Chamber of Commerce in India (AMCHAM), Calcutta Chapter, presents A Slipping Glimpse, a hybrid choreography fusing contemporary Western and Indian classical dance. Developed simultaneously in San Francisco and India, it features dancers from Margaret Jenkins Dance Company, USA and Tanusree Shankars troupe in Calcutta. A one-of-a-kind performance, it explores the intersection of the private and public realms at a divisive and artistically challenging moment in history. A stunning work of theatre, it is a rapturous celebration of fragility and resilience, offering an insight into the real meaning of being alive. What distinguishes the performance is its emphasis on fierce physicality, besides its brilliant set-design, with multi-level platforms and elevated walkways. Concept and choreography: Margaret Jenkins. Creative inputs: Tanusree Shankar.

 Event: A Slipping Glimpse, a choreographic presentation 

When: Today and tomorrow, at 6.30 pm 

Where: Science City Convention Centre

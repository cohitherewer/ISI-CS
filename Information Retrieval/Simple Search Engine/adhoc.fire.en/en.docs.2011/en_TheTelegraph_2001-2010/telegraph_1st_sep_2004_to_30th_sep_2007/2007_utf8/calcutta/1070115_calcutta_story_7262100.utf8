 Flowers in the waterworks

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has decided to utilise the vacant fertile land on the compound of its Palta waterworks for growing export-variety flowers.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya on Saturday said: Our state has already made its presence felt in the global flower market in Holland, Japan and Dubai. We want to expand our trade.

 Civic horticulturist Ranajit Samanta said the state was earning more by exporting flowers than rice or potato.

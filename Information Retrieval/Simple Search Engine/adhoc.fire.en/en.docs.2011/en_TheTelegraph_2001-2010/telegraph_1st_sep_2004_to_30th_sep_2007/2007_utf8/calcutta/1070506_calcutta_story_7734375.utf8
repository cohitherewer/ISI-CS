The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Twin Towers of tickets 

 Calcuttan of the Week

 Name: Abdul Kadir (picture by Bishwarup Dutta)

 Claim to fame: Makes models with old Metro Railway tickets

 Achievements: Taj Mahal, World Trade Centre, Metro cinema hall 

 Metro mania: Born on the pavement outside the office of an English daily in Esplanade, Abdul never had a teacher. But he was always interested in art. He started by sketching in the mud and slush. In 2000, when he was just 12, he saw the Metro Railway staff throw away used tickets. He began crafting small models with them. The tickets are hard and hence, easy to work with. I initially made small models of a palki, bus and a taxi before attempting more elaborate structures like those of temples, says Abdul. 

 Minds eye: He has built things he never saw, like the Twin Towers. Abdul was so moved after 9/11 that he had created the model in four days. Whatever I did, I managed on my own. The Metro Railway employees are very helpful, and have never refused me the tickets, says the nimble-fingered youth. Abdul expressed his gratitude by making them a five-foot pandal made of tickets for Vishwakarma puja. 

 Cost factor: The model of the World Trade Centre sold for Rs 800. Some of Abduls more elaborate works sell for Rs 2,000. He has priced his model of the Metro cinema at Rs 4,000. Smaller pieces like a palki are priced between Rs 20 and Rs 30. The works are on display at the tea-stall run by his mother in front of the Esplanade Metro station. Passers-by often stop to admire Abdul at work or buy his models. The prices of the works depend on the craftsmanship and the time spent on them, says Abdul. He insists that money is not the driving force. I used to work in a shop for a livelihood. Now I assist my mother at her stall, he says.

 Return to dreams: Abdul recently won the first prize at a government-organised handicraft fair, but has not been able to work since losing his sister two years back. I was very disturbed and couldnt concentrate. I have not made anything since, he says. He now feels that he needs to go back to his passion to come to terms with the loss. Dreams drive him. I hope to make it to the Guinness Book of Records some day, Abdul says with a shy smile.

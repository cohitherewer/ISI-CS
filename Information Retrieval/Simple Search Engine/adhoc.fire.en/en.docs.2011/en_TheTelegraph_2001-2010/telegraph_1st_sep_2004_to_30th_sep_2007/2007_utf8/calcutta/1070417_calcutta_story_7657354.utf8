 Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury (picture below by Bishwarup Dutta) can take one look at a 100-digit number and tells in reverse order. He can do the same with giant formulae. Meet the memory man who has cracked the Guinness World Record for memorising most birth dates. He visited the city in the first week of April and demonstrated his skills at the Science City auditorium.

 How does the man, who memorised the names and dates of birth of 14 unknown people to crack the record, manage to remember so much in just about no time? I use three techniques mainly, said the 33-year-old who stays in Chandigarh. They are association, imagination and ridiculous thinking. Using these methods anyone can improve their memory like I have done.

 He explained the trick behind remembering minute details. Biswaroop draws on the fact that visual memory is sharper than aural. You have to find associations between facts and use your imagination to visualise otherwise uninteresting facts and figures. Also if you think in terms of the ridiculous, recollection becomes easier.

 These methods have been around for a long time, Biswaroop told Metro during a chat after his presentation. I just made them more user-friendly.

 He has a few other tips for students. One needs to forget unwanted information. Its like deleting files to make room for new data. It is also important to get your regular dose of sleep something most youngsters ignore before and during exams.

 An engineer from Punjab University, Biswaroop had travelled all over the country in his formative years before settling down in Chandigarh. He has two Guinness Records in two categories that are poles apart one for memorising the maximum number of birth dates and the other for completing 198 push-ups in a minute.

 Biswaroop has recently published a book on his latest work on memory techniques, titled, Tera Kya Hoga Kalia. He is now eyeing a national record for the most books sold in a year.

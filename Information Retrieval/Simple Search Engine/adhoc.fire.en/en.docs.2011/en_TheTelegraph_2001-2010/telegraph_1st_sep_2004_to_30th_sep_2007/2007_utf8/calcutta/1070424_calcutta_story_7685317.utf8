 Looking back on Fassbinder

 The enfant terrible of the New German Cinema, Rainer Werner Fassbinder ruthlessly attacked both German bourgeois society and the larger limitations of humanity. His films detail the desperate yearning for love and freedom and the many ways in which society, as well as the individual, thwarts it. Concluding today, the ongoing retrospective of films by the celebrated, controversial German filmmaker highlights his breathtaking command of the formal narrative, the social critique and as well as his wide canvas of operation. To be screened today: Bolwieser (5 pm) and The Marriage of Maria Braun (a still from the film appears right; 7 pm). The first of Fassbinders trilogy about women in post-WWII Germany, Maria Brauns stark atmosphere, icy performances and poignant revelations make it one of the most important films to emerge from Germany in the 1970s and certainly one of Fassbinders best. Newly-wed Maria is separated from her soldier-husband Hermann Braun. Bill, an African-American soldier, becomes her lover long after she receives news that her husband has died on the front. However, the starving and emasculated Hermann turns up while Maria and Bill are beginning to make love. The effect of the film is one of helplessness; the audience can only watch as the beautiful, young Maria Braun places herself in an emotional vacuum.

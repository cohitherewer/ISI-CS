 Hunt on for real killers

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Sleuths are trying to find out who had accompanied Pradip Mullick, or Dom Pradip, when he visited Chetlas Lockgate area on Saturday night.

 The gangster was reportedly killed by a mob, comprising mostly women, in Lockgate that night.

 Though initial reports suggested that Pradip was killed in a spontaneous uprising, the sleuths now suspect that some of his associates had a hand in the lynching.

 If the suspicion proves to correct, the names of Pradips companions that night may shed some light on the identity of the real killers.

 Among the names the sleuths are verifying is Gurupada Halder, alias Gurey, one of Pradips most trusted aides since he entered the crime world. After Pradips arrest in connection with a murder in October 2000, Gurey had stepped into his shoes.

 In April, a few weeks after Pradip was released on bail, Gurey had reportedly masterminded a late-night bomb attack on Lockgate while the residents had gathered around a temple for a puja. Among those present with Gurey during the attack was Mandela, another associate of Pradip.

 It seems Gurey and Mandela were keen to keep the area under their control even after Pradip was out on bail. The duo might have masterminded the lynching for that reason, said an officer of Chetla police station.

 The sleuths are also surprised that not a single person in the crowd could recall the registration number of the vehicle in which Pradip and his men had entered the area on Saturday night.

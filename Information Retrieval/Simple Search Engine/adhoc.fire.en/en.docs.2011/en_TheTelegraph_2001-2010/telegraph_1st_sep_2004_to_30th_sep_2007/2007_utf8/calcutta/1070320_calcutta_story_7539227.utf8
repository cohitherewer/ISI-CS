 The controversy over police firing in Nandigram has spread to the world wide web. 

 A member of Orkut, a popular social networking website, has put up online the username and password of a state government email account, urging Netizens to use them to build public opinion on the Nandigram issue.

 We have received news of the post on Orkut. We are trying to trace the person responsible and will request the authorities of the forum to delete the topic, said deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Gyanwant Singh.

 The member, who identified himself as Amar, created a topic titled Lets play the game Nandigram on Orkut and invited members of the forum to protest the killings in Nandigram. He also uploaded a username and password of a government email id and requested people to send mails using the account. 

 Surely some of you want to protest against what happened in Nandigram. Do it to be one of them. Mail from here (the government website) as their mail server administrator, wrote Amar.

 He suggested that the users of the account pose as the chief minister.

 The topic was created on March 16. Till Monday evening, nine members had responded to Amars post. Most of them were apprehensive and wrote that they might get into trouble if they accessed the government email.

 It is not known how many people have sent emails using the username and password, said an officer of the detective departments cyber crime wing.

 A member with username Rahul asked to whom should the mails be sent and what should be their content. Another member, identified as Nilanjan, advised Amar not to get involved in mischief.

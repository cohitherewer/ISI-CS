 The state government will build a flyover at the JK Saha bridge intersection in Salt Lake to ease traffic flow to and from the Sector V tech hub.

 The 500-metre, north-south flyover will stretch from Bowlers Den, on the Salt Lake Bypass, to the Wipro office. The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) will start work on the Rs 18-crore project next month-end.

 The concrete-and-steel structure will have four lanes and offer vehicles moving towards the Rajarhat flyover a speedy passage over the intersection. 

 We carried out a survey to identify the cause of traffic problems at the intersection and find a way to tackle them. The flyover was conceived after the survey, said the CEO of the government agency, P.R. Baviskar.

 One traffic outpost, two constables and a traffic light were not enough to handle traffic at the intersection, the study had concluded. 

 Two people died this year after mishaps at the junction.

 The waiting time at the crossing, according to Sector V employees, varies between two minutes and seven minutes, depending on the time of the day. 

 The intersection has always been a problem, said Ajoyendra Mukherjee, vice-president and head of Calcutta operations, Tata Consultancy Services. The flyover will reduce the traffic problems in the area, said Rabindra Chamaria, chairman, Infinity.

 The study found on an average, about 60,000 vehicles use the crossing daily. The number will shoot up once Main Arterial Road and the New Town tech hub are ready.

 The chief engineer of the traffic and transportation wing of the CMDA, Debdas Bhattacharya, said: There will be service roads beside the flyover. The Salt Lake Bypass will be widened to prevent a bottleneck at the intersection. 

 In addition, two roads will be built near Nicco Park and the entry point of AL and BL blocks, off Amartya Abasan, to improve traffic flow in Salt Lake.

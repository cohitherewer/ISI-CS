 The state government is planning a permanent fairground near Central Park, in Salt Lake, to showcase Bengals handicrafts. Artisans from other states will also be allowed to sell their products from here.

 The micro and small-scale enterprises and textiles minister, Manab Mukherjee, had written to the urban development minister, Asok Bhattacharya, seeking land for the project, modelled on Dilli Haat in New Delhi.

 The plot that has been identified by the urban development department hosts fairs through the year. As soon as the plot is handed over, we will start work, said minister Mukherjee. 

 The urban development minister said: Of the 10 acres, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority is developing as a permanent fairground, we will hand over 2.5 acres to the small-scale enterprises department, where it can showcase handicrafts. 

 The fairground will have permanent structures that will enable proper display of the products and will also help the artisans to directly interact with the customers. 

 The interaction between artisans and customers will open up opportunities of tie-ups, said Mukherjee.

 According to him, the necessity of the permanent fairground has been felt for a long time.

 A fairground showcasing Indian handicraft will attract hundreds of foreign tourists. But we could not find land for such a fairground till now, the minister added.

 The department plans to set up such permanent fairgrounds at Durgapur, Murshidabad, Bolpur and Siliguri.

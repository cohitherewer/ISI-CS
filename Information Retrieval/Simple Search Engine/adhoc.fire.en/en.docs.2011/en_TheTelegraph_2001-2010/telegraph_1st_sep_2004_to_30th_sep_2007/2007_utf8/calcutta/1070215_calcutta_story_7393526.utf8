 JD Birla Institute has been chosen as the nodal agency to oversee a capacity building project on street food being implemented by the central government with assistance from World Bank.

 A total of 16 home science colleges from across the country have been selected for the project, which has been divided into three phases by the ministry of health and family welfare. The objective of the first phase was to identify indicators on the awareness, attitude and practices related to food hygiene and safety.

 The faculty members and students of the home science department of JD Birla Institute have started working on the second phase which involves sensitising street vendors. The first orientation session in the city was recently held in Tangra where 25 street food vendors interacted with the students. They showed interest in improving their habits and were enthusiastic to undergo training in preparing and selling hygienic and nutritious food.

 Non-stop fun

 This years Xavotsav, organised from January 26 to 28 in association with The Telegraph, rocked with events like the Xoadies, which included unusual contests like eating as much as possible within five minutes and picking up a coin from a bowl of flowers with the mouth. Vishal Anand Rao from St Xaviers College won the event.

 Bhawanipur College was a hit in the western group dance while Sensex was all about the buying and selling of stocks. Nach Baliye saw couples dancing to the theme Love is in the air. I really liked the War of the DJs. We danced late into the night, gushed Madhuri Menon, a first-year student of B.Com. Recalled Harshvardhen Daga, a first-year student of JD Birla Institute of Management who participated in War of the RJs: I had to speak impromptu on the topic If you were a child. For War of the Rappers, I had to fill in for the original participant.

 The debate was won by Neelanjan Chatterjee, a second-year physiology student at Presidency College, who spoke for the motion Technology is curbing creativity among the youth. Said Rajrupa Das, a first-year student of English at JU: I enjoyed the eastern solo item by St Xaviers College. But security was too strict this year while Xavotsav is all about having fun. Cassinis Division belted out signature tracks on Day II for live music enthusiasts, including Drowning and Caesar. DJ Akash was a hit, with students going wild grooving to Hips dont lie and Wheres the party tonight.

 The host college was declared the winner, with Bhawanipur College and Umesh Chandra College coming runners-up.

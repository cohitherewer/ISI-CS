The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Civic map for green details

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is drawing up a detailed environment map of the city to check illegal landfill, felling of trees and unlicensed factories. Work on the map, a first for the CMC, will start soon.

 The map will have details of all existing waterbodies, factories, vacant land and big roadside trees in a particular ward. We will consult environmentalists and draft NGOs to help us, said Sushil Kumar Sharma, mayoral council member (environment).

 The map will be uploaded on the Net and can be available at the click of a mouse. We will start work on the map next month, he added.

 Sharma explained that now, even if the department comes to know of a particular waterbody being filled, it is difficult to get details of its ownership, its actual size or if it is used for pisciculture. 

 Recently, we cleaned a waterbody in Behalas Fakir Para Lane. But we had no idea before starting work that it could hold at least 20-ft-deep water. Residents of the area are quite happy that they will be able to swim in it. We also plan to help local youths to start pisciculture in it, he said. 

 There exists a number of factories in congested areas of some wards. Some of these industries produce chemicals. The map will give the location of a particular factory and it will also declare what items it produces and who owns it. 

 All this information will be of immense help in case of an accident. We will get the primary details of the unit and at the same time, know whether it had the mandatory clearances, Sharma said. 

 The map will also list the big trees in every ward. So, as soon as we come to know of a tree or trees being cut down, our men can rush to the spot and take appropriate steps. Also, if a ward needs trees to be planted, the map will show it and we will act accordingly, Sharma signed off.

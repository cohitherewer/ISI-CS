 The day after a mobile phone battery exploded at their Ganguly Bagan home, the Sahas geared up to move consumer court for compensation from the manufacturing company. The firm had not contacted them till late on Thursday.

 I bought the phone two-and-a-half years ago from a shop in Durgapur. I still have the Nokia box and users manual. Since then, the original battery and charger were being used, said Suman Saha, whose wife Kishori was the closest to the Nokia 2100 set when it exploded while being charged.

 The 25-year-old homemaker, who is five months pregnant, was traumatised and had to be taken to hospital. She was feeling much better on Thursday.

 With Nokia not contacting the Sahas, Suman was planning to approach the Federation of Consumer Associations, West Bengal, to claim damages.

 Nokia officials in Delhi claimed they were in the process of meeting Kishori Saha, but did not indicate any time frame. We take any report regarding the integrity of our products extremely seriously. We are working closely with the relevant authorities and battery suppliers to investigate the matter further, said an official. Should there be any doubt about the safety of our products, Nokia will take immediate and appropriate action, he added.

 The battery that exploded on Wednesday, BL-D3, does not belong to the BL-5C series that Nokia had issued an advisory about on suspicion of overheating. Thursday saw many cell phone users flocking to Nokia Care Shops, asking whether their BL-D3 batteries were safe.

 Mala Banerjee, president of the Federation of Consumer Associations, West Bengal, said the Sahas should write to Nokia, claiming damages of up to Rs 1 lakh and keep the federation in the loop. The documents that the family must produce, she added, are:

 Cash memo of the cellphone purchase

 List of articles damaged with cost

 Doctors prescription with mention of trauma

 Mention of pregnancy.

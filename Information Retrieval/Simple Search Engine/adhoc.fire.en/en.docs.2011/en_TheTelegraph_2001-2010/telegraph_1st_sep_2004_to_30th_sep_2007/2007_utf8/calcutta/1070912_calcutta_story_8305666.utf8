 A fire in the kitchen of fast food outlet Bedwin in Gol Park at Tuesday noon caused panic in the area. No one was injured in the blaze.

 According to police, leak of cooking gas from a cylinder resulted in a small fire inside the kitchen. There were four employees in the kitchen at that time.

 The pipe of a gas cylinder had come unstuck from the oven. A spark led to the blaze. Our officers inspected the site of the fire and asked the owner of the outlet to replace the pipe, said Dulal Chakraborty, the officer-in-charge of Gariahat police station.

 It was a freak incident. Luckily, no one sustained burns. The manager of the restaurant informed us and we immediately rushed to the spot, added Chakraborty.

 The fire was brought under control within minutes.

 There were fire extinguishers in the restaurant. The employees doused the blaze using the extinguishers. The fire was put out before the tenders arrived at the spot, said another officer of the police station. 

 As soon as the news of the fire spread, pedestrians and shopkeepers in the area panicked. 

 Initially, we thought that a major fire had broken out and immediately recalled the incident at McDonalds. Some of the shopkeepers near the outlet started fleeing. There were very few customers at the restaurant when the fire started, said the owner of a neighbouring shop.

 Enchanting summertime blues

 The blues started out as the gut-wrenching and heartfelt musical call of the oppressed. It reflected the angst of early black Americans and gave birth to a sound that marched hand in hand with gospel and soul music. The only mainstream blues band in the country, The Saturday Night Blues Band are stalwarts of the Someplace Else phenomenon. This evening, Jet Airways, Open Doors and Tollygunge Club host Blue Mood, a music concert by the band. Showcasing authentic, live blues music while giving the audience an overview of the blues, the group creates a musical time-line of the blues, starting from down home Mississippi delta blues of greats like Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters to Chicago greats like Elmore James. They also trace the journey of blues music right up to contemporary sounds of the likes of Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt and others. Their music will be interspersed with blues history as well as interesting anecdotes to liven up and give more meaning to the songs. Band members: Jayanta Dasgupta, Arunima Dasgupta, Stuart Munro, Pradyumna Singh Manot and Jeffrey Rikh.

 Event: Music concert by The Saturday Night Blues Band When: Today at 7.15 pm Where: HSBC Hall, Tollygunge Club

 A law exists which makes it compulsory for children to take care of dependent

 parents. But the number of complaints of neglect is meagre compared to

 reality. A bond can be a starting point for claiming redress but, like

 in the case of any legal contract, one can always slip out through loopholes.

 It is not enough to get a bond signed. One needs proper counsel to pursue

 the case in court. How many in rural India can afford this? Neither is

 there an authority to supervise if one is fulfiling ones duty to the

 parents in accordance with the bond or as ordered by the court.

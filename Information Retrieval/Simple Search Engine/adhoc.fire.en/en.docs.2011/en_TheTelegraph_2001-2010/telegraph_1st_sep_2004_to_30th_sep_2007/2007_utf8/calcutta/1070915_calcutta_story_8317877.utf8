The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Forged car papers haul

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Amal Kumar Dutta has blood on his hands.

 For a year and a half, the young man from Dakshin Notunnagar, in Barasat, ran a racket that churned out fake driving licences, registration papers, carriage permits and every other document required by rogue vehicles.

 Amal, in his mid-20s, was arrested on Thursday night by the detective department. So many forged licences were seized from his house that till late on Friday, the officers had not accounted for all of them.

 In its three-week-long campaign for safer streets, Metro has highlighted how drivers booked for rash driving return to the wheel armed with a fresh licence to kill. 

 The arrest of Amal and four others underlines how easily they can do that.

 It is difficult to tell the forged licences from the original ones. There was enough material in Amals house to produce a huge number of forged licences. He had fine marker pens to copy signatures from the original licences, said city detective chief Ajoy Kumar.

 An electronic typewriter and a lamination machine were also found.

 The driving licences had signatures of regional transport officers from the public vehicles departments in Barrackpore, Madhyamgram, Calcutta, Howrah, Alipore and Hooghly.

 The arrested men, too, were held in different parts of the city Mostak Ali in Madhyamgram, Azizul Gazi and Sisir Ghosh in a Bowbazar hideout, and Vinod Kumar Chauhan in his Agarpara residence.

 Amals agents would charge between Rs 1,200 and Rs 1,500 for a fake licence. The rates for the other documents would vary according to their nature. There was no vehicular document that could not be made to order by this gang, said an officer.

 We will find out if officials in the public vehicles departments were involved and whether the racket catered to the Bangladesh market also. Their list of clients included car-lifters, added Kumar.

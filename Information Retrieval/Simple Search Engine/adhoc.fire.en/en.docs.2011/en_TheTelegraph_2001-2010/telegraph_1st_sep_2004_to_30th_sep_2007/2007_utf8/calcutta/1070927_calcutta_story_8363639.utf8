 Three senior officers of the city police had violated the law by summoning Rizwanur Rahman and Priyanka Todi to the Lalbazar headquarters without registering a case and counselling them to part ways.

 Section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) states that the police cannot summon a person without registering a case against him under the Indian Penal Code, said a legal expert.

 The police have confirmed that no case was registered against Rizwanur, who had married Priyanka against the wishes of her businessman father Ashok Todi.

 Yet, the three officers deputy commissioner (headquarters) Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (detective department) Ajoy Kumar and assistant commissioner (anti-rowdy squad) Sukanti Chakraborty summoned the couple thrice to Lalbazar.

 Rizwanur had written to the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights (APDR) that Kumar had given him two options to let Priyanka go back to her parents or face arrest.

 This was a threat. No one can be arrested without a case against him and a probe. The police had received two complaints from Todi, but no FIR was lodged. Besides, Section 163 of the CrPC states that no police officer or person in authority shall make inducement, threat or promise to compel a person to do something, said a senior police officer.

 Kumar denied having threatened Rizwanur, but said he had told the 30-year-old computer graphics teacher that he might be arrested as a formal complaint had been lodged against him. Todi had lodged a missing diary a day after meeting Priyanka at her in-laws house in Tiljala, and another complaint accusing Rizwanur of abducting his daughter and stealing valuables.

 We were about to start a case based on the complaints. Thats why Kumar told Rizwanur that he might be arrested, said an officer of the detective department.

 According to criminal lawyers, Rizwanurs letter to APDR will play a key role in identifying the guilty officers. It could also be used as a dying declaration during the trial, said a lawyer.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has laid the responsibility of running the Calcutta Leather Complex (CLC) on land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah.

 A project-monitoring committee chaired by Mollah, which held its first meeting on May 25, decided to take on the problem of pollution first.

 Union finance minister P. Chidambaram flagged off the CLC last year before the Assembly elections, but so far, only 118 tanneries have set up shop here. Even these function with creaky infrastructure and minimal benefits. 

 We have received complaints that the four effluent treatment plants at the CLC are not functioning properly, said Mollah. Harmful chemicals, like chrome and lead, are finding their way into the Karaidanga canal and there have been reports of cattle deaths because of this polluted water. 

 The minister has asked environment department officials to study the problem and submit a report. Ive asked the promoters, ML Dalmiya and Company, and also the tanneries association to seriously address the issue, he added.

 However, it is not yet clear how the committee will tackle the problem of relocating other polluting tanneries here the prime reason why the Supreme Court had ordered construction of the complex.

 By Mollahs own admission, at least 300 tanneries still operate out of Topsia and Tiljala, when around 35 acres of land meant for these units are lying unutilised in the CLC.

 The minister, however, stressed that the committee will prioritise pollution. Our first priority is to reduce the pollution and make the CLC functional by removing the infrastructure bottlenecks, Mollah asserted.

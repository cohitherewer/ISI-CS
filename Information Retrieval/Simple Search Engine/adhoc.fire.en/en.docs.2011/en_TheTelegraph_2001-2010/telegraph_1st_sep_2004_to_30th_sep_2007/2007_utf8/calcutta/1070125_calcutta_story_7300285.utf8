 Mum on Maidan maul cry

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The army, in its affidavit to the high court on the Book Fair case, has not countered the allegations made against it by petitioner Sabyasachi Roy Chowdhury.

 The PIL will come up for hearing before a division bench of Justice B. Bhattacharya and Justice K.K. Prasad, on Thursday. 

 Roy Chowdhury, an advocate of the high court, had claimed in the PIL that the armys decision to allow the Book Fair on the Maidan was against its policy of opposing fairs on the greens because of the resultant environmental degradation. 

 In its four-page affidavit, the local army informed the court that they allowed Publishers and Booksellers Guild, organiser of the fair, use of the Maidan from January 31 to February 11 on the basis of a directive from their superiors, said Roy Chowdhurys counsel Kalyan Banerjee.

 The army, in the affidavit, did not state that the environmental condition of the Maidan would remain unaffected due to the holding of such a fair, added Banerjee.

 The petitioner had pointed out 

 that the neither the army nor the government had the right 

 to allow one organisation use of the Maidan while denying 

 others. The army did not submit anything in its defence, 

 said the petitioners counsel.

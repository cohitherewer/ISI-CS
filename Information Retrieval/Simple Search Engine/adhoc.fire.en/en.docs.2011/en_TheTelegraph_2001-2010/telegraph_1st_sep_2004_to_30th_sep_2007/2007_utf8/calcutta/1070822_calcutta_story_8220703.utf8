The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mobike duo put in cuffs

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The two men on a motorcycle, who had followed three young women in a taxi from Lake Gardens to Bijoygarh on Saturday night and tried to drag one of them out, were arrested on Monday night. 

 They were identified as Gautam Ganguly, 35, and Biswajit Das, 41. They said they ran a security agency and are married with a child each. Both live on Rakhal Das Auddy Road, in Chetla.

 The men were produced in the additional chief judicial magistrates court at Alipore on Tuesday and granted bail. They will have to appear for an identification parade. According to police, both have confessed to their crime. The two friends have been charged under sections 114 (abetting a crime), 354 (outrage of modesty), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 341 (illegal detainment) of the Indian Penal Code.

 Following a tip-off, we conducted a raid and picked them up from their homes, said South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar.

 The three young women Debashree Majumdar and Malini Banerjee, who work for The Telegraph, and a friend of theirs were returning home from Park Street on Saturday night. The men started trailing them around 12.30am near the Lake Gardens bridge. 

 Near the Golf Green TV Centre, they tried to cut into the taxis path and waved at the girls to stop. The driver didnt and the motorcyclists fell behind. 

 They reappeared as the taxi approached Debashrees house in Bijoygarh. When the taxi stopped in front of her house, the men first tried to chat up the driver and then tried to open the backseat door through his open window.

 One of the men grabbed Malinis hand and tried to drag her out. Debashree started screaming for help. A cousin heard her and came running towards the taxi.

 When confronted, the men, who appeared drunk, claimed that they found something suspicious about the taxi and were enquiring about it.

 When Debashree and Malini identified themselves as journalists, the two fled on the motorcycle, a Royal Enfield Bullet, whose registration number the women noted down.

 Space jam at venue

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The axe has fallen on some of the permanent features of Calcutta Book Fair such as Childrens Pavilion, Books of the Year Hall and the artists corner Monmarte thanks to a space crunch at the new venue.

 The actual space at Salt Lake stadium is much less than what has been shown in the layout, forcing us to do away with some of the star attractions of the fair, Publishers and Booksellers Guild general secretary Tridib Chatterjee said on Wednesday, after the lottery for allotting the stalls.

 A section of the booksellers and publishers, not happy with the preparations for the 32nd Book Fair, feared that several stalls would not be ready before Fridays scheduled inauguration.

 They demanded that more workers be deployed and that they be made to work round-the-clock at the stalls.

 Several participants have told Guild that they want the fair to continue till February 26 (the scheduled closing day is February 21). The Guild is yet to decide on the demand.

 There was, however, one good news for the Guild. Bidhannagar Municipality has waived the trade licence fees of the stall-owners. 

 The amount would have varied from Rs 500 to Rs 1,500. But the municipality will collect the other charges, amounting to Rs 2.5 lakh, said an officer of the civic body.

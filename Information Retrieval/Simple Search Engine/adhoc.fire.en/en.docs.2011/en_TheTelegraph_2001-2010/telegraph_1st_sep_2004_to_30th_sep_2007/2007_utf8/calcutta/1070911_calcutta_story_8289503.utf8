The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bypass park poised for makeover

 - Study centre, architecture school on cards

 SUBHRO SAHA AND DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Swabhumi, the Bypass theme park, is poised for a Rs 150-crore makeover powered by hospitality and education.

 We are looking at a three-pronged action plan to re-energise the place rejuvenation of the existing campus, creating an international study centre with guest rooms and adding an academic block to house a school of architecture and an arts college, Harsh Neotia, the chairman of Ambuja Realty, told Metro.

 The 6.5-acre park was developed by Ganapati Parks Limited, a joint enterprise of Ambuja Cement (an erstwhile company of the Ambuja group) and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).

 The civic authorities have given conditional approval to the construction of a hospitality address at Swabhumi, but municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay stressed this must be accompanied by public-benefit projects like a school of architecture, a scholars guest house and a school of public policy.

 In the first phase, targeted for completion in 12 months, vertical movement up the hill will be boosted by escalator/ lifts and a new food court, more accessible to cinema traffic, will be built. Designed by Vivek Rathore, it will offer a broad basket of Indian fare.

 The urban courtyard will use up its provision for another floor, to house 12-14 rooms. These will be given out to research scholars camping in town at a 50 per cent discount.

 We will try to create an old-world, cosy ambience and students staying there will also benefit from the lively atmosphere at the multiple-element theme park, observes architect Partha Ranjan Das, overseeing the urban courtyard renewal.

 Takshashila, the international study centre, scheduled for the second phase, will have conference rooms, coffee shop, emporia, library, bar and restaurants and around 100 guest rooms. The 125,000-sq ft integrated project is being designed by Delhi-based architect Manit Rastogi of Morphogenesis.

 The centre could be a crucible encouraging convergence and thought-sharing. For the hospitality rooms, we want to have a Bengal Club-like positioning, with membership options, reveals Neotia.

 The academic block, to come up simultaneously, will house a school of architecture and design to cater to Calcuttas fast-developing urbanscape, while talks are on with Calcutta University to set up a private arts college.

 As far as the municipal commissioners pet project a centre for public policy on urban affairs goes, Neotia said the idea was to showcase best practices from leading cities of the world in urban and municipal affairs and discuss elements we can replicate or use.

 As part of the Swabhumi expansion plan, a parking lot for 400 cars is also being created.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Thats what friends are for...

 A STAFF REPORTER

 First, gaze at the giant black-and-white billboards rewinding to the romance of the Coffee House. Then, tune in to a new frequency of nostalgia from Wednesday morning.

 At 8 am on February 28, the ABP group launches its radio channel, 91.9 FM.

 From Manna to Chandrabindoo, Hemanta to Cactus, Kabir Suman to Mohiner Ghoraguli, music and lyrics to go with the Calcutta adda will play on the frequency, 24x7.

 The channel focusing on friendship promises to cut through the clutter of choices available on the radio and take listeners back to the best years of their lives.

 Songs that the now 20-to-40 grew up with is what we will be playing. All those songs they hummed in college and at para addas. All those songs associated with the best years of their life, says Jaideep Banerjee, programming head of the station.

 Film music will merge with the non-filmy, the traditional with the trendy as the pathos of Coffee House-er adda melts into Fossilss Opodartho.

 While the popular picks will be from 1971 to 2003, there will be space for songs before and after. Of course, we wont leave those out. But they will not be part of our core list. They will be part of special segments or requests, explains Banerjee.

 The content will also be a healthy mix of Bengali and Hindi, with select English numbers thrown in. All the growing-up pleasures and pangs of Gen-Ex and GenX.

 The channel also promises to play songs according to the changing moods during the day, moving from classical and meditative in the morning to cheerful and upbeat in the evening.

 At the end or beginning of the day, 91.9 FM will be an ode to friendship, through every mood and moment. After all, thats what friends are for.

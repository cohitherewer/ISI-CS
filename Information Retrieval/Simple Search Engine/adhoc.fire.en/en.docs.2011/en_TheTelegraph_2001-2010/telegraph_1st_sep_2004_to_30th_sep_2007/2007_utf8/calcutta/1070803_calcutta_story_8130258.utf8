 Snag halts landing system

 SANJAY MANDAL

 The multi-crore Category-II Instrumental Landing System (CAT-II ILS), which became operational at Calcutta airport a month ago, has developed a snag and stopped functioning.

 The mid-runway visual range (MRVR) equipment, a key component of the CAT-II ILS, has ceased to function after its cable got damaged twice.

 A software in the MRVR equipment, too, was damaged beyond repair following a short-circuit during the prolonged downpour early last month. Replacing the software has been ruled out till September.

 The CAT-II ILS, which the airport had been demanding for long, has been installed on the primary runway at a cost of Rs 6 crore to ensure that flights remain on schedule even in low-visibility conditions, especially during winter and monsoon.

 The system allows pilots to land even when visibility dips to as low as 350 metres. Without it, a pilot needs a minimum visibility of 550 metres to land (see graphic above).

 CAT-II is badly required during heavy rain and also in winter, when visibility around the airport falls below 550 metres, resulting in severe disruption of flight schedules, said an official of the Airports Authority of India.

 Flight services have not been hit since the CAT II system stopped functioning, but that can happen any time now, as monsoon is still active over south Bengal, he warned.

 The MRVR equipment, imported from Finland, was installed at a cost Rs 1 crore in September 2006. It is one of the three key components of the CAT-II ILS, the others being the localiser and the glide path.

 The localiser aligns the aircraft to the centre line of the runway, the glide path gives the pilot the correct angle for descent and the MRVR provides data about visibility on the runway.

 The MRVR became inoperative after its uncovered cable got damaged twice during extension of the secondary runway.

 The 2,399-metre secondary runway is being extended by another 440 metres on the northern side. The primary runway is 3,627 metres long.

 The MRVR software that was damaged beyond repair was supplied by the meteorological office in Pune. It is used for recording the visibility and supplies data to the air traffic control, area control and the meteorological department at the airport.

 The software became defunct following a short-circuit, caused by seepage of water in the unprotected cable during the July 3 downpour, the official added.

 The airport officials have been asked by the higher authorities not to reinstall the software till the extension work on the secondary runway is complete and the cable is covered.

 The extension work is likely to be over in September, after which the cable will be covered.The CAT-II ILS will be functional again then, the official said.

 Avi Naskar, 13, scored 499 runs in six matches in the Ambar Roy Memorial Tournament last season, with a highest score of 218 not out. The opener from Sinthee Roypara Cricket Coaching Club was dismissed only once in the Cricket Association of Bengal meet. However, his future in the game is uncertain. The boys father, who repairs glass panes, and his mother, a tailor, struggle to fund his passion. 

 There are many other players in and around Calcutta who fight a daily battle for survival before they pad up to face a pacer or mark their run-up to rein in a batsman on the rampage. The young talents often do not know whether they will play another match, no matter how successful they are on the field on a given day. 

 A programme by the recently formed Eastern Zone Cricket and Talent Development Institute can work wonders for the likes of Avi. The institute will hold trials in September to select 10 to 15 male and female cricketers in the under-15 and under-17 categories and fund their cricketing expenses, including coaching fee and price of gear, said the organisations general secretary, Pawan Bengani. The institute will also hand over a monthly allowance to the families of the very poor cricketers among them, he added.

 We have asked coaching camps to identify players who are talented yet needy. A formal announcement will be made in the first week of September, stated Bengani. 

 Up for selection will be 14-year-old left-arm spinner Somnath Maity, who has made it to the Bengal Under-15 squad and has taken 18 wickets for International club in the second division league this season. My father washes cars and doubles as a driver sometimes. My mother works as a cook. I have a 12-year-old brother, who also plays cricket. Such an initiative will be helpful for cricketers like us. Ill try to do well at the trial, said Somnath.

 We want to help more players when we get more funds. We will organise specialised training camps for the selected players, said the institutes treasurer, Milan Biswas. The money is coming both from corporate bodies and individuals.

 There are people who want to help needy cricketers. We are providing them a platform, said the institutes assistant secretary, Avrojit Bhattacharya.

 Former Bengal players Barun Burman and Pranab Nandi, Manoj Tiwaris coach Manabendra Ghosh, former junior Bengal womens coach Subhra Bhaduri and P Sen Memorial Cricket Coaching Club coach Swapan Dasgupta are on the selection panel.

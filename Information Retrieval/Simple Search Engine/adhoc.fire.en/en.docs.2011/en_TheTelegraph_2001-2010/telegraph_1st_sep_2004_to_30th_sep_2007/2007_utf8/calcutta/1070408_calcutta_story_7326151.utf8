The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Prestige post for architect 

 From September 1, 2007, Indian-born Sunand Prasad will take over as the first Asian president of the chief architectural institution of Britain, The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). Metro on Sunday talked to him about Calcutta, the nation and climate change.

 Born in 1950, Prasad spent his childhood in Gandhijis Sevagram ashram, while his family had strong connections with Santiniketan, where his father was taught. Prasad later studied at the Architectural Association in London. A founding partner of the multi-award winning London-based practice Penoyre amp; Prasad, Prasad has overseen a wide range of projects, many of them in the public sector.

 The president-elect is looking forward to his stint at one of the worlds most prestigious architectural organisations. I think being RIBA president is more important than being the first Indian-born RIBA President.

 He expresses concern on the subject of architecture and city planning in India. So much of Calcutta (and Indias) architecture is imported from places like Singapore, and of course Europe. There is so little attention being paid to the actual requirements of the people who live in the cities. 

 Prasad also feels that climate change might have a very adverse effect on Calcutta and West Bengal if environment issues are not addressed sooner rather than later. If things dont change, Calcutta may experience a vast number of climate refugees from Bangladesh, which will be very hard hit by climate change.

 Prasad is keen, however, to point out that its not all bad news. I dont want to sound too gloomy. There are lots of great things happening, like the introduction of the Metro in New Delhi Calcutta has had one for some time now. I dont think we can overestimate Indian intelligence when it comes to addressing these problems.

 Question baffles students

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 An incomplete question confused Madhyamik candidates writing the English second language paper on Friday.

 Question nine of the paper asked the examinees to write a letter about a fair without mentioning to whom it would have to be addressed. The question carried 12 marks.

 Soon after the examination started at noon, the authorities of several schools serving as examination centres across the city and the districts called up the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education office and sought a clarification.

 It was definitely a slip on the part of those in charge of preparing the question paper. We are probing how such a mistake could appear in the paper. Action will be taken against those responsible, stated board president Ujjwal Basu.

 The board directed the heads of the examination centres to tell the examinees that they could address the letter to whoever they liked. Students will be awarded marks irrespective of who they have addressed the letter to, stated Basu. The decision has been conveyed to head-examiners.

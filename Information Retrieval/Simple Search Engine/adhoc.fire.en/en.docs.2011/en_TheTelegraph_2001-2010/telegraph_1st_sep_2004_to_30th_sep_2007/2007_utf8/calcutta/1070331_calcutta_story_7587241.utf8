 Tips for urban resurgence

 Balkrishna Doshi: For enhanced interaction. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta

 Selective pedestrianisation of urban zones, diversion of non-functional traffic from core congested areas, taking pride in our splendid architectural heritage and riverside regeneration

 These are some of the prime points in architect-planner Balkrishna Doshis prescription for Calcuttas policy-makers, going forward over the next two decades.

 Every city has to grow, but in this mad rush for urbanisation, we are losing our own special domains for interaction. Dont divide us by buildings and roads. Instead, try to figure out how we can come together, because we Indians are gregarious by nature, the Ahmedabad-based architect stressed on Friday.

 Doshi was in town for the launch of Efficiency and Comfort, the LIG and MIG segments of Upohar The Condoville, the social housing project he has designed for Ambuja Realty, set to come up behind Peerless Hospital, off the Bypass.

 He emphasised that the only way to decongest the central core of a city is to find out if it is necessary for all the traffic to go through. You must find ways to divert traffic which has no function in that area. Its also critical to improve the quality of the public transport system to control car population, Doshi added.

 Endorsing the proposal to redevelop the riverfront between the two bridges as a pilot project, the veteran architect said awareness was the key. If you can make people say our river is our source of pride and we want to develop it, then it has to happen.

 He felt it was important to pedestrianise areas in BBD Bag where the buildings are fabulous for their proportion and grandeur. Also, the streets are so beautiful and you have heritage not many metros have. The Strand warehouses could be restored and converted into rare rendezvous for recreation, arts and culture and education, Doshi pointed out.

 He expressed confidence that Upohar would become another benchmark after Udayan The Condoville, Calcuttas first organised large-format residential complex, which he had designed for Bengal Ambuja 12 years ago.

 Harsh Neotia, Ambuja Realty managing director, pledged greater clarity in terms and conditions for Upohar.

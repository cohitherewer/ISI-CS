 MOHUA DAS

 The cover of the seventh and final book of JK Rowling

 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is set to hit the bookracks on July 21. But the seventh and last book of JK Rowling has already launched the magic word pre-booking in stores and a discounts war. 

 Landmark has notched up 200 pre-bookings over the past month. Potter lovers can pay an advance of Rs 300-Rs 500 to book a copy and avail of a 15 per cent discount after its release. 

 Bookstores started pre-booking last year, when they sensed the crazy demand for Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. This year, the frenzy for the young wizard is more intense. We plan to take in orders till the end of May. The demand seems greater this year, so we plan to ship in 1,500 copies, compared to last years reserve of 1,000, says Manish Samson of Landmark. 

 Crossword Bookstore is offering customers a chance to pre-book with an advance payment of Rs 975 the book costs that. This will give the buyer free membership of the bookstore for further offers, updates and invitations to events, as well as a free gift voucher of Rs 200. There are discount Harry Potter six-in-one sets and VCDs and DVDs.

 Since Potter maniacs queued up at its door from 5 in the morning last year, The Family Bookstore on Park Street has decided to mark down its price to Rs 750 for a copy of the new book. There is no need for advance payment. The order can be placed over the telephone. Were ready to open shop at 5 am this year, too, says Ashok Burman of the store. He sold nearly 500 copies of the sixth book on the first day. 

 Oxford Bookstore has been receiving an extremely good pre-booking response, building up over the past three months on its website and its retail store. It has on offer a 15 per cent discount on online bookings and other attractive packages and events around the book.

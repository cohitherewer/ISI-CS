 Dry taps in repair wake

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Taps in over 200,000 households in the city proper remained dry on Sunday due to emergency maintenance work by CESC at the Palta waterworks and Tallah pumping station.

 There was no power supply at the Palta waterworks for 13 hours from 9 am. Chief engineer (water supply) Bibhas Maity said work resumed at Palta at 10 pm. There will be normal water supply on Monday.

 About 260 million gallons of filtered water are supplied daily to the city from the waterworks. The net shortfall was 190 million gallons. 

 Water supply was not affected in the areas within the command zone of the Garden Reach waterworks.

 The northern pockets of the city, from South Sinthee to Maniktala, were the worst affected. Central Calcutta pockets like Sealdah, Burrabazar and Esplanade were also affected. In south Calcutta, the stretch from Park Street to Gariahat and Beleghata, Tangra, Topsia, Kasba and Tiljala in east Calcutta also went without water.

 Three institutions an ayurvedic hospital, a ladies hostel and ESI Hospital had requested the civic water supply department for supply of potable water in tankers. Twelve tankers of water were supplied to them.

 They hang out near the City Centre fountain, shop at the stores in the mall and have sampled every dish served at the restaurants and food court there. And now, they have taken their love for the Salt Lake address online. 

 There are three communities of City Centre lovers on Orkut, a social networking website popular in the city. The mall seems to be the only one with such a large fan following on Orkut. 

 I have discovered during my frequent visits to City Centre that there is hardly any Calcuttan who has not been to the mall. So, I was quite confident about attracting people to my community, said Ritam, a final-year MCA student and owner of the most popular of the City Centre communities.

 The community, started last April, has over 2,100 members. The other two City Centre communities on Orkut have around 1,000 and 130 members.

 There are also communities on Orkut of Netizens who frequent the INOX multiplex and KFC outlet at City Centre.

 The members comprise not just Calcuttans, but those who have visited the mall and are now settled outside the city, added Ritam.

 The topics of discussion range from ones favourite part of City Centre to upcoming events. 

 For some members, though, the growth of the community has come at a price. When the community started, almost every member contributed to the discussion. With the increase in membership, some people have joined just to post advertisements, complained Sanandita, a law student and a member of Ritams community.

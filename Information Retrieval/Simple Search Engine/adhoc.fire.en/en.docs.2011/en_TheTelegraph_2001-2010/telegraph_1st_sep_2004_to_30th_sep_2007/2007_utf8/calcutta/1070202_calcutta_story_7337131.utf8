 Bhaskar Mukherjee duped hundreds of unsuspecting investors, luring them to a joyride of the upwardly mobile Sensex in the capital market.

 Six months after the technical analyst with a private television channel and owner of Biniyog, a finance company, was arrested, a lawyer couple defrauded his mother Chitra Mukherjee, using the complexities of the legal system.

 But Ramapada Jana and wife Anima failed to give the law the slip and were arrested from their Chetla residence on Thursday on charges of cheating their client of more than Rs 3 lakh.

 Bhaskar and his father Smritimoy were arrested last July and were behind the bars for swindling people by promising them high returns from the capital market. 

 The advocate couple promised Chitra that her son and husband would get bail if she was willing to spend some money, said an officer in Chetla police station. 

 Chitra gave them Rs 2 lakh in cash and jewellery worth over Rs 1 lakh, which the couple promised to spend on their contacts for the duos immediate bail.

 But, according to police, Ramapada and Anima did nothing for their client and the father-son duo only got bail after three months.

 On returning home, Bhaskar and Smritimoy found out that the lawyers had played a trick on Chitra in their absence and demanded a refund from the couple. 

 But the lawyers refused to pay up, which forced the Mukherjees to file a complaint with the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) of Alipore court in December. 

 We were instructed by the CJM to conduct a probe. After investigating the case, we found there was truth in the complaint and arrested the couple, said the officer. 

 Ramapada and Arunima were produced in the CJMs court on Thursday and granted bail.

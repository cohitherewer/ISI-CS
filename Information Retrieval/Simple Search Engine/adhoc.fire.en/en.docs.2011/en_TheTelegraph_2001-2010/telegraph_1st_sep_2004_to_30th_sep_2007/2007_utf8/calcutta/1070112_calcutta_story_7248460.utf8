 Tribute to the sur-yogi

 In Sanskrit, sur stands for divinity and musical tone. Indian philosophy, mythology and science together assert that a living being is the microcosmic representation of the macrocosmic universe. The navel, heart and throat points generate a-u-m, the three constituent sounds of the celestial omkaar. All worldly music is, therefore, cognate to spiritual, celestial music. Swami Vivekananda, a yogi who was a true music aesthete, emphatically declared it to be the highest worship because the keynote running through music is I am He. To celebrate the birth anniversary of the sur-yogi, eminent musicians of the country offer homage with a day-long festival of music. Participants (at 9 am): Hari Prasad Chaurasia (flute), Ramakant Gundecha and Umakant Gundecha (dhrupad), jugalbandi by Anindo Chatterjee (tabla) and Bhawani Shankar (pakhawaj). At 2 pm: Guru Gangadhar Pradhan and the troupe of Odissi Dance Academy (Odissi dance recital), Debasish Bhattacharya (guitar). At 6 pm: Nayan Ghosh (sitar), Ulhas Kashalkar (vocal).

 The Prince of Calcutta did not only play saviour with the bat on his comeback tour in South Africa. Beyond the boundary, he was involved in another rescue act. One that might save a young life. 

 I called Sourav in South Africa, seeking support to save the life of 19-year-old Raj Goswami, who needs a liver transplant. Sourav immediately agreed, as he has always done, urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya told Metro on Sunday morning from Siliguri. The relatives of the Siliguri boy had approached the minister for funds to carry out the transplant.

 Bhattacharya will be present along with Sourav at the auction of cricket gear autographed by Maharaj in the city on Monday evening to raise money for Rajs treatment.

 About Rs 16 lakh is needed for the transplant. I expect the money to be raised at the auction, said Bhattacharya.

 Raj is suffering from advanced cirrhosis of liver. A transplant is costly and can be done only in a handful of hospitals in the country. 

 There are generally two problems in transplant of liver availability of donor and funds. In Rajs case, his mother is the donor. The funds will be taken care of by the minister, explained Abhijit Choudhury of SSKM Hospital, who is treating the teenager. 

 According to the doctor, after a liver transplant, both the donor and recipient regenerate the residual part of the organ naturally. The success rate is about 95 per cent. 

 A typical transplant costs between Rs 20 and Rs 25 lakh. Subhas Gupta of Apollo Hospital in Delhi has agreed to carry out the surgery at almost half the cost, added Choudhury. 

 Rajs father Mridul, who works as a clerk in North Bengal University, recounted: When the doctor explained the necessity of a liver transplant and informed us about its cost, I did not know what to do. But for the support of Dr Choudhury, who took it upon himself to organise everything, the transplant would not have made possible.

 He added: The minister, too, has been extremely helpful. He roped in Sourav to ensure that the funds are generated and kept assuring me all through that everything would be alright.

 The father and son will leave for the Capital on Monday morning. The surgery is expected to take place in end-January.

 Raj, who was treated in Siliguri and Guwahati before being shifted to Calcutta, said: After coming back from Delhi, I want to meet Sourav once to thank him. 

 The ex-India skipper has said that Rajs fight is more important than his effort to re-establish himself in Team India.

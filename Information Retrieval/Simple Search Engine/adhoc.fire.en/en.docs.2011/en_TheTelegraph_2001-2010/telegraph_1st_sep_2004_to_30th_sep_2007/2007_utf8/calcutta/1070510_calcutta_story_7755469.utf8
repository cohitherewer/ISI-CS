 Suicide bid by student

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A Class XI student of Bally Girls School attempted suicide by setting herself on fire on Wednesday after failing in the annual examination.

 A school employee managed to foil the attempt, after which the girl was handed over to police. She was released on an undertaking that she would not repeat such acts.

 Both the school authorities and the police claimed that the student had enacted the suicide drama to pressure her teachers into promoting her to Class XII.

 Chaitali Bagchi, head teacher of the school, said: A minimum score of 20 in English (second language) is one of the criteria followed by the Higher Secondary council for promoting students to Class XII. But this girl scored only 18.

 The police said the student, a resident of Kakeswartala, in Belur, had plotted the drama in advance as she had a hunch that she would not be promoted. She carried a bottle of kerosene and a matchbox in her school bag, an officer said.

 Soon after finding out on Wednesday morning that her name did not figure on the list of successful students, the girl requested the English teacher, Shampa Bhattacharya, to promote her to Class XII.

 After Bhattacharya pleaded helplessness, the girl entered the teachers room, poured kerosene on her body and tried to set herself on fire. 

 However, Tarun Ganguly, a non-teaching employee, snatched the matchbox from her in the nick of time.

 The head teacher immediately called Bally police station, from where a team rushed to the school. The girls family members, too, came to the school and blamed the authorities for forcing her to attempt suicide. They backtracked after the police threatened to take action against them.

 Asit Sau, inspector-in-charge of Bally police station, said: We have not taken any action against the girl as she is a minor.

 Rs 650cr plan to unclog roads

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY AND SIMI KAMBOJ

 The civic body and the state government are planning to build five mini-flyovers at intersections and widen and extend several arterial roads to decongest important zones in the city.

 The five flyovers will be constructed at Moulali, Ballygunge Phari, Mullickbazar, Ultadanga and Shyambazar by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) at a cost of Rs 150 crore.

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and the transport department, on the other hand, have joined hands to draw up a Rs 500-crore blueprint for widening and extending arterial roads. 

 The plan includes extension of Amherst Street from BB Ganguly Street to Lenin Sarani, extension of Jadavpur Central Road to Deshapran Sashmal Road and construction of a link between Belgachhia Road and Ultadanga.

 According to government officials, extension of Amherst Street via Sashi Bhushan Dey Street will help south-bound vehicles to reach Lenin Sarani without taking Chittaranjan Avenue and clogging Esplanade. The proposed extension of Jadavpur Central Road is expected to help vehicles moving westward to reach Deshapran Sashmal Road, Rashbehari Avenue and Tollygunge.

 The construction of the link from Belgachhia Road to Ultadanga (over the Ultadanga railway yard) will benefit south-bound vehicles, including those moving towards Salt Lake. The cars will be able to avoid the congestion at Jessore Road-Lake Town crossing and Shyambazar. 

 The flyover on BT Road, connecting Bhupen Bose Avenue and RG Kar Road, will reduce congestion at the Shyambazar crossing, while the one at Ballygunge Phari will reduce congestion on Gariahat Road by connecting Hazra Road with Bondel Road and Broad Street.

 The Mullickbazar flyover will start near Assembly of God Church school and stretch over AJC Bose Road to the tram tracks. The flyover on Moulali will connect Lenin Sarani to CIT Road over AJC Bose Road.

 The flyovers will be built on turn-key basis and the CMC will soon invite expressions of interest along with conceptual designs from builders. 

 Five more flyovers on city intersections will be considered in the second phase, said officials.

 The CMC is also working towards providing a mastic asphalt coat to all city roads. About 80 per cent of the city roads have a mastic asphalt cover now. 

 After two or three years, the civic roads department will only have to do maintenance work. The number of cars on the road is likely to shoot up. We should prepare for that, said CMC commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 The roads to be widened in the north under the CMDAtransport department master plan include Jessore Road (from Shyambazar to Barasat), Rajarhat Road, Howrah-Amta Road, Andul Road (from NH 6 to Vidyasagar Setu), Foreshore Road (from Telkalghat Road to Vidyasagar Setu) and Dum Dum Road.

 In the south, Biren Roy Road (East and West), MG Road, Coal Dock Road, Hyde Road and Taratala Road will be widened.

 The metropolitan centre is the hub of cultural and business activity. Though it covers only 15 per cent of the total metropolis, around 47 per cent of Calcutta Metropolitan Areas (CMA) population is concentrated here, said a CMDA official. 

 Transport department officials feel that the measures would cut travel time by 50 per cent and decongest Shyambazar, Ultadanga, Belgachhia, Dum Dum, Howrah, Esplanade, Sealdah station, Behala and the Port area.

 There is no scope to build new roads. But existing roads will be widened to the extent possible, said an official. The department is trying to determine to what extent the roads in the city can be widened.

 Thirty per cent of the funds for the projects will be provided under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission while the state government will foot the rest of the bill. 

 Road widening will begin after Puja and will be carried out in phases.

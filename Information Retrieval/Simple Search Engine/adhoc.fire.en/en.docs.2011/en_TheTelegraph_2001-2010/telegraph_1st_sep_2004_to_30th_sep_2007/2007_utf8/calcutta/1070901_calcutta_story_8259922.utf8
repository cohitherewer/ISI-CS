The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta cry of battery bias

 - Delay in replacement of faulty cellphone parts resented

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Nokia is yet to replace the faulty cellphone batteries of many city customers, more than 15 days after it issued an advisory on a batch of BL-5C batteries that might overheat during charging.

 The company has been much more prompt in Delhi and Mumbai. People in Mumbai, I gather, got their batteries replaced in 48 hours, alleged retired bureaucrat Manindra Nath Banerjee in a letter to Metro.

 He and his daughter filed online applications for battery replacement on August 15. The newspapers said the defective BL-5C batteries would be replaced in 10 days. We have not received even a phone call from the company yet, said the Jodhpur Park resident. 

 Ishani Dutta Roy, a resident of Dum Dum, has the same tale to tell. Only, she had filed the online application a day earlier than the Banerjees. 

 Nokia declined to provide a city-wise break-up of batteries replaced. An operations manager at a Nokia Care shop claimed that four Nokia Priority Dealers and Nokia Care shops in the city have replaced over defective 1,000 batteries.

 We have enough BL-5C batteries with us. We have just started sending the new batteries by courier, he said. According to him, the delays might have been caused because of improper registrations.

 There are complaints regarding that, too. Sodepur homemaker Dipannita Ganguly told Metro that she learnt at a Nokia shop in Dunlop on Thursday that she and her daughter had not received new batteries because their complaints had not been registered. Both of us received SMS texts from Nokia saying that the new batteries would reach us by courier, asserted Dipannita.

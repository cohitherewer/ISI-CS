 It was a tourney featuring young, aspiring school footballers in town at the TTIS Shootout 07. The finals were held on August 12 at the Sports Authority of India (SAI) grounds in Salt Lake. North Point Day School, Dum dum, (picture by Bishwarup Dutta) emerged on top in the rain-soaked match, thanks to a Tanmay Kundu hattrick. His school also completed a hattrick of title wins.

 The North Point team came back thrice against St Thomas Boys School, Kidderpore, in regulation time and went on to lift the Link Champions Trophy. The juniors of St Thomas, however, won the finals in their category defeating Kendriya Vidyalaya, Ichhapur 4-2 in a largely one-sided clash. 

 The five-a-side annual TTIS Shootout this year saw 80 schools participating in the seniors event while 32 teams were in the fray in the junior category. 

The seniors final started at a brisk pace with North Point team, clad in orange, launching a flurry of attacks on the St Thomas citadel. Two shots ricocheted off the crossbar in the very first minute. The boys from Dum dum kept up the pressure and won three corners in quick time. In the eighth minute, however, a spanking left-footer from St Thomas skipper R.L. Sang Zelei gave the boys in red the early lead against the run of play. But Tanmay equalised soon for North Point. As the match went on, St Thomas took the lead two more times, but on each occasion Tanmay emerged the saviour for the holders, the last of them in injury time in the second half. North Point then went on to win the tie-breaker 3-2.

 In the junior final, St Thomas outclassed Kendriya Vidyalaya, Ichhapur, scoring four goals in the first half itself. The second half was more evenly contested and the Ichhapur school was able to pull two goals back, both scored by their lanky skipper Sourav Majumdar.

 Making a change

 Gender equality can be brought about only by nurturing youngsters to appreciate it. Thoughtshop Foundation organised an awards programme recently for college students (picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha), youth groups and youth networks at Madhusudan Mancha. 

 It recognised the social initiatives taken by youngsters who were part of the We Can End All Violence Against Women campaign of Oxfam, an international organisation working against poverty and injustice. 

 The programme started with a short film on gender equality that included Rahul Bose and Javed Akhtar as the speakers. The film, with the refrain, Bas bahut hua, ab zulm nahin sahena was appreciated by the audience. 

 A game show, Kaun Banega Changemaker, modelled on Kaun Banega Crorepati, compared by RJ duo Rakesh and Pragya followed. 

 The questions on the show focused on concepts like healthy sex ratio, on missing women, the term coined by Amartya Sen to refer to women not alive due to the neglect accorded to the girl child, and on the causes behind missing women. 

 The interactive show was followed by the award ceremony. The special guests invited to give away the awards had broken gender stereotypes themselves: Jaswant Kaur is a heavy vehicles operator in Jamshedpur while Asha Hansda operates earth-moving equipment. Jasbir Kaur drives a taxi, and Gobinda Bhakta is a male nurse. 

 City colleges like Maulana Azad College, St Thomas College of Engineering, groups like Ramnarayanpur Kalika Sangha and youth networks like NCC 33 Bengal Battalion were rewarded for their efforts in fostering changemakers. Oxfam aims at making 5,000,000 changemakers in Southeast Asia by 2011. Thoughtshop Foundation has helped create 10,000 changemakers among the youth, from areas like Howrah, Calcutta, South and North 24-Parganas.

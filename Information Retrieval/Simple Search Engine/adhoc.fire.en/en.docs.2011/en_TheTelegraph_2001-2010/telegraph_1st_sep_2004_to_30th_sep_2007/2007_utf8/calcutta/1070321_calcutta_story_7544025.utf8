The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Civic budget passed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) chairman Nirmal Mukherjee on Tuesday ensured that the Rs 2,300-crore civic budget for 2007-08 was passed within 15 minutes of the House being convened.

 It was the first time a civic budget was passed without a debate or an amendment moved by the Opposition. The chairman did a headcount of Left Front councillors, passed the budget and adjourned the House for the day amidst altercation between councillors of the treasury and the Opposition benches.

 The Congress, Trinamul Congress and the BJP condemned the partisan role of the chairman. 

 Leader of the Opposition Javed Ahmed Khan claimed that the budget has no legal or constitutional approval. Congress municipal party leader Pradip Ghosh observed: What was passed could have been a puja budget as well. 

 BJP leader Debabrata Majumdar said: The incident proves Communists have no faith in democracy.

 Chairman Mukherjee, however, asserted: The budget was passed following the procedure of the civic House.

 The second day of the budget session of the civic House was tense from the start over the Nandigram issue. Both Trinamul and Left councillors were in a combative mood.

 Trinamul councillors Aroop Biswas, Prahlad Chakraborty, Firhad Hakim and Shyamali Bhadra and CPM councillors Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, Goutam Das, Badruddoza Molla and Manju Kar got involved in altercations. Some of them were carrying eggs and pebbles, but did not get a chance to throw them as the House was declared adjourned abruptly by the chairman. 

 According to a former law officer of the CMC, the budget was not passed in a proper manner. Since the session was scheduled to continue till 7 pm, the chairman could not have asked councillors to raise hands for passing the budget long before that and before a debate.

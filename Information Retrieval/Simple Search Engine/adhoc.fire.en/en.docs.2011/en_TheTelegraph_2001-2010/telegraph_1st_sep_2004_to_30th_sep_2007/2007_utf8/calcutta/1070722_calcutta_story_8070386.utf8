The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 When nothing was weird

 A young man from Allahabad talks about life in Presidency College

 Inside Out

 I came to Calcutta to join Presidency College from Allahabad, a place very different culturally. So different that I find it almost impossible to convey to my friends back in Allahabad the spirit and milieu of College Street and Calcutta.

 One of the things that made my stay here such a unique experience was, of course, the people. While I believe that people everywhere are basically the same, what ultimately makes them so different are their priorities and choices. While most of my school-friends were shocked at my decision to opt for studying physics and not appear for the engineering entrances, I found scores of students here who had given up potentially more lucrative career options to groom themselves to do later what they were truly passionate about. Whether it was research, poetry or politics. 

 A more striking example would be that of the economics senior who thought at length about what it was that he really wanted to do in life and finally decided that all he needed in life was to travel. He made up a list of places that he must see before his death. Everything he would do, his job included, would be geared to achieve this goal. 

 Such students who were brave enough to make unconventional choices whether it was related to what they wanted to do in life, their appearance and dress or their moral and ideological beliefs were never called weird or ridiculed. 

 In Presidency no one was out of place, almost nothing was taboo and every one, no matter how weird, was respected and understood. I think it is true for the people of Calcutta in general that they have a list of priorities very different from people in other parts of the country (and money is relatively low in the list). An average person in Calcutta would, for instance, spend much more on books, travel and food than people in other cities.

 There are, however, other things about Calcutta that I, as an outsider, have never really understood. 

 Although I still miss the lazy hours I used to spend in the college canteen, many of my friends had a rather extreme attitude towards work. Or its absence. They would glorify laziness and hard work for them was just not cool. Another thing about my friends from Calcutta that was a touch irritating at times was that they had such rigid opinions on just about everything, opinion they would rarely question. I feel, for instance, that some of the students in college had not discovered Marxism but simply inherited it as a part of the tradition of Calcutta, like a religion without questioning (which does not mean that their deep concern for society could be doubted). 

 Then there was the strange notion, some had, that a bit of cleanliness, maintenance and punctuality would somehow rob Calcutta of its charm. Also the belief, held by a few, that disrupting the daily life of thousands is the only effective way of protesting.

 Despite all this, however, Calcutta is a city that one gets addicted to. As I said earlier, to someone who has not experienced it, any description of the intoxicating quality of life in College Street would probably be inadequate. Memories of the endless adda sessions in the Hindu Hostel lawn or the college canteen, the incredible love stories and the gossip surrounding them, the pranks we played, the heated arguments, the poets and the intellectuals some of them so pretentious, others equally stimulating the slogans, the elections and the politics (which was so entertaining if you were not emotionally attached), will always be very special. 

 Even now the nostalgia overwhelms me at times. For many school life is the time they remember most when they get older. But for me the three years I spent in college in Calcutta would always be the most unforgettable, for they were truly the wonder years.

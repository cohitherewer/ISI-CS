The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tall claims in foul-air defence

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The next time you choke on foul fumes belched out by a public vehicle at a crowded crossroad, dont blame it on the government.

 For, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is allegedly doing everything it can to check pollution caused by auto emission in the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) area.

 Thats the claim that all suffering Calcuttans will term preposterous the government is poised to make before the high court. This was decided at a meeting chaired by chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb at Writers Buildings on Tuesday afternoon.

 Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury told the chief secretary that his department had upgraded 88 auto emission-testing centres across the city to monitor pollution and issue pollution-under-control certificates.

 In addition, the department has given out 50 gas analysers to motor vehicle inspectors and traffic police for random testing of vehicles, claimed Chowdhury.

 On April 4, Metro had reported on an Asian Development Bank (ADB) survey warning of 6,700 additional premature deaths by 2014 in the city if desperate measures were not taken by the government to check auto emission.

 The ADB action points included conversion of polluting vehicles to cleaner fuel for which Writers has done precious little and banning older vehicles for which the government has decided to blame the court.

 In an affidavit responding to a PIL filed by environment activist Subhas Dutta in Calcutta High Court last week, the government will blame the court for scuttling its move to check auto emission by quashing a notification last year, banning pre-1990 vehicles from the CMDA area.

 In his petition, Dutta has pointed out that despite the city topping most pollution charts, nothing was being done to curb the killer.

 The court has directed the government to submit a status report on auto emission and the measures being taken to combat it.

 At Tuesdays meeting, when the issue of a crackdown on polluting autorickshaws was brought up, the transport secretary shouldered arms. Chowdhury confessed that his department was unable to crack down on three-wheelers, since most of them enjoy the patronage of Citu, the CPMs labour wing.

 About 30,000 registered and another 30,000 unregistered autos ply in the CMDA area. Less than 10 per cent of them a major source of pollution have switched to LPG.

 This was the first stock-taking exercise on automobile pollution in the past nine months and it was all about false claims of government action. That says it all, said a disgruntled green lobby member.

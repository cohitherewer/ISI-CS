The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Special buses, extra policemen

 OUR BUREAU

 The government will run special buses and deploy extra policemen on Wednesday to prevent disruption because of strikes called by Citu and the Bengal Taxi Association. 

 The chief minister said at Writers Buildings that the Citu strike would not have much of an impact on life. There should be no confusion. This bandh is only for the unorganised sector, he said.

 Transport department officials announced on Tuesday that airconditioned and Volvo buses would ply from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport to facilitate passenger movement .

 The special buses will be run by West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation, said an official. The buses will connect different parts of the city and its outskirts, including Esplanade, Santragachhi, Gariahat and Joka. 

 Those arriving at Howrah, Sealdah and Calcutta stations may face problems, though. With taxis not available, many passengers could be stranded. 

 Our strike has coincided with that of Citu and it will inconvenience people. But we are helpless, said Bimal Guha, the secretary of the taxi association. He said 35,000 taxis would go off the road on Wednesday.

 The Citu strike, on the other hand, will keep rickshaws and autorickshaws off the road. The state leadership of the union claimed that they would try to avert a bandh-like situation, but the leaders of the private bus unions and market wings of Citu made it clear that there would be a ripple effect on public transport and bazaars. 

 Though markets have been kept outside the purview of the strike, Matadors and rickshaw-vans that carry vegetables and fish to the markets will not ply. Also, the porters and other daily-wage labourers, who carry such goods, and street vendors will join the strike, said Asim Banerjee, a leader of Citu-run Dokan Karmachari Samiti. 

 Bani Dattagupta of the Citu-controlled Bus Workers Union echoed him.

 Private buses as well as school buses and chartered vehicles have been exempted from the strike. However, the earnings of the bus workers depend on the number of passengers and we cant blame them if they withdraw buses from the road if few people venture out, he said.

 About 1,500 police officers will be deployed across the city to ensure normalcy, stated Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 City set to dazzle by night

 - Free flow of civic funds to light up roads

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Make the city dazzle at night is the latest directive of municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay to the civic lighting department. He has promised a free flow of funds for the project.

 In the first phase, Rs 2 crore has been allotted for the illumination of the Sealdah flyover and its surroundings, Chittaranjan Avenue, Ashutosh Mukherjee Road, Jawaharlal Nehru Road (between Shakespeare Sarani and AJC Bose Road), Bondel Road, the stretch between VIP Bazar and Bondel Gate flyover, Judges Court Road, BK Pal Avenue and Ballygunge Place. 

 The work will commence in April and is scheduled to be completed before Puja.

 The roads were shortlisted after a survey found them to be dimly lit, said chief engineer (lighting) Pradip Jyoti Biswas. Dark roads are more prone to accidents and criminal activities, he pointed out.

 As part of the scheme, 150-Watt vapour lamps used for lighting roads will be replaced by 400-Watt ones, stated Biswas. 

 Mayoral council member (lighting) Sushil Sharma pointed out that of the 232,000 bulbs in the citys 126,000 lamp posts, only 52,000 are of the vapour variety. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has taken up a scheme to phase out incandescent lamps and fluorescent tubes.

 We also plan to introduce solar-powered street lights in the city, said Sharma. The West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Authority will initially set up about 100 solar-powered lamp posts in Khanaberia, on the eastern fringes of the city. 

 If the experiment proves successful, the civic body will set up more solar-powered street lights in Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Monday summoned police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and reportedly rapped him for his comments on the Priyanka Todi-Rizwanur Rahman case. Soon after the meeting, Bhattacharjee ordered a CID probe into Rizwanurs death.

 The police chief met the chief minister at 11.30am in the presence of chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy. The meeting lasted 35 minutes.

 At 12.05pm, Mukherjee emerged from the chief ministers chamber and said: We discussed several things.

 Around 1.30pm, Bhattacharjee announced a CID probe into the death of the 30-year-old graphic designer, found dead on the railway tracks on September 21. Police claim he committed suicide, while the Rahmans allege he was murdered.

 The chief minister reportedly expressed displeasure over Mukherjees comments made at a media conference at Lalbazar on Sunday afternoon. The chief minister was upset by what the police chief had said about the gulf in the social and financial status of the Todis and the Rahmans, said an official.

 Terming the death of Rizwanur tragic, Bhattacharjee said: Ive decided on a CID probe. They will investigate how the boy died and the circumstances leading to his death. They will also probe the allegations that have arisen. The CID will investigate all this and give me a report at the earliest.

 Niraj Narayan Pandey, the deputy inspector-general of police (CID), stressed that all three angles of murder, suicide and abetment to suicide would be probed.

 Mukherjee put up a brave front when asked whether he was upset over the probe being handed over to the CID. Why should I be upset? This happened with my consent. There should be an impartial probe and we welcome it, he said, adding that the Todis should be back in town by Wednesday.

 With Lalbazar agog about the top cops discomfiture, CPM strongman Rabin Deb added fuel to the fire by telling the Rahman family in Tiljala that the government had earlier removed then police commissioner B.K. Saha and so no police officer, however senior he might be, would be spared if found guilty.

 Rizwanurs brother Rukbanur said the family did not have faith in the CID, as it was part of the same police establishment and demanded a CBI or judicial probe.

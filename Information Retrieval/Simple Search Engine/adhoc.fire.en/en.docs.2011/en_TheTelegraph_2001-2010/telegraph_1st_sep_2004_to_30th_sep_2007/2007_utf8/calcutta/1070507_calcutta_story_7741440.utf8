 Tap snap illegal, says HC

 - CMC eyes apex court route for right to disconnect water lines

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The high court has rendered useless the most potent weapon in the civic bodys armoury for collecting property tax dues.

 A division bench of the court ruled in end-April that Section 275 (aa) of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) Act, 1980, which provides for disconnection of water supply to recover dues, was illegal.

 The civic body has recovered hundreds of crores of property tax in the past few years by snapping water lines. The outstanding property tax figure now stands at Rs 515 crore.

 Stung by the verdict, the state government has decided to move the Supreme Court.

 In addition to the CMC, the government will also be a party to the case. It is our legislation that has been challenged in the court, said municipal affairs secretary P.K. Pradhan on Sunday.

 According to government officials, the division bench held that it was not ethical on the part of the CMC to snap water lines when there were other means of recovering property tax dues under the civic laws.

 The CMC now has four penal measures at its disposal for recovering outstanding property tax. These are issuance of warrant of distress and sale of movable property, attachment and sale of immovable property, recovery under Bengal Act III, 1913, and attachment of the rent of the tenant(s).

 Of the provisions, disconnection of water supply was the only workable solution. People would invariably pay the dues. Were trying to file our plea before the apex court goes on summer vacation, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 A single bench of the high court had struck down the provision of water disconnection about two years ago. The CMC then moved the division bench, which has upheld the ruling.

 The bench stated that the provision was included in the municipal laws only in the late 1990s and it gave excessive powers to the civic body. The court also observed that there were no guidelines or proper classification of defaulters under this law, meaning those owing Rs 100 and those owing Rs 1 lakh could be treated in the same manner, said an advocate connected with the case.

 The CMC had drawn up a list of defaulters whose dues had crossed Rs 25 crore. The court ruling has scuttled the civic bodys plans of disconnecting water supply to the defaulters premises.

 Many people have challenged the provision in the CMC Act. This ruling will have a bearing on all those cases pending in the high court, added the advocate.

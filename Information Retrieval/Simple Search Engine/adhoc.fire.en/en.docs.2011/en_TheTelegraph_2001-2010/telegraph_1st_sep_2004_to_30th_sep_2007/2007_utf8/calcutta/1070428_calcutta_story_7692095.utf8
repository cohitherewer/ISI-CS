 Classes have been on for six months, but Calcutta International School (CIS) will be formally unveiling its new home on the EM Bypass on April 30.

 A special day, in association with The Telegraph, has been planned on the 121-cottah campus, thrice as large as the previous Lee Road premises.

 The 53-year-old school now has about 550 students, a mix of Indian and foreign, pursuing O-Level and A-Level.

 There will be a series of events on April 30, with a focus on fund-raising. 

 The highlights will be an art auction and a raffle with a variety of prizes. The proceeds from both will go towards the development of facilities on the new campus.

 We are a non-profit school and also the cheapest international school in the country. We need fund-raisers and such events are central to the funding of the school, said CIS principal Anuradha Das.

 The spotlight will be on the auction, where parents and other guests will buy works from some leading artists, including Wasim Kapoor.

 We will also be auctioning works of art by our own students, which is, of course, very important to us, added principal Das, whose office walls are adorned with works by some senior students.

 The art and design talent at the school is fantastic, stressed the principal, and this will be reflected in the quality of the works that will be up for auction.

 The auction will be conducted by old girl Konkona Sen Sharma, who has promised to take time out from her busy Bollywood schedule.

 Besides the public auction, there will be a silent auction, where discreet bids will be placed by jotting down names on pieces of paper and putting them in a box.

 The chief guest for the day will be British deputy high commissioner Simon Wilson, with a VIP dinner rounding off the proceedings.

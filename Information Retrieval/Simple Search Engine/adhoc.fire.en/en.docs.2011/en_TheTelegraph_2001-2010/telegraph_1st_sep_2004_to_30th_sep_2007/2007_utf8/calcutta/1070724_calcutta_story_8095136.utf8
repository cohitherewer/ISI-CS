 Winning strokes

 Offering due recognition to young, upcoming artists has been one of the primary objectives of Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture. Accordingly, in the course of its 40th annual exhibition held in January 2007, the Academy has identified six artists from among a sizeable number and awarded them for achieving excellence in their respective areas of artistic pursuits. Svikriti, the ongoing exhibition, presents works by the awardees: Koushik Coomar (Indian painting; Making of Durga; picture right), Shuvrakanti Mitra (watercolour), Subhash Chandra Nath (graphics), Animesh Dutta and Pappu Bardhan (painting) and Gourab Malakar (sculpture). Coomars paintings take us on an idyllic sojourn into rural Bengal. Mitra concentrates on urban landscapes done in contemporary style. Naths works reveal his preference for medieval themes. While Duttas landscapes are enveloped in a rhythmic mystery, Bardhans canvases articulate his frustration with urban life. Malakars ceramics are studies in personality and character rather than that of living forms.

 Event: Art exhibition featuring works by six award-winning artists When: Till August 5 (except Monday); 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture, 1st floor

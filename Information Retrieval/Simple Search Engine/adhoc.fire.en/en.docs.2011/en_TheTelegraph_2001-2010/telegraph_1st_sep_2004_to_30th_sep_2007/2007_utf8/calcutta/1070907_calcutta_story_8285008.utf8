 Beacon atop cars, list swells

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The state government has decided to enlarge the list of those who can use the beacon atop their official cars.

 The police commissioner, district magistrates, superintendents of police and vice-chancellors are among the new candidates on the beacon list.

 The move follows a decision by the Centre, empowering state governments to prepare their own list of those who are entitled to use the beacon atop their cars.

 A Calcutta High Court order had forced the beacon-entitled dignitaries to remove the red light from atop their vehicles and attach it to the front bumpers.

 But the Centres stand has also empowered the state to allow the dignitaries to put the beacon back on the roof of their vehicles.

 To implement its decision, the state government will have to seek formal permission from the high court, where a case on the issue is pending.

 Advocate-general Balai Ray conveyed the states stand to the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar on Thursday.

 The government is likely to get a copy of the Centres order in a couple of days. After receiving it, we will inform the court how we propose to implement our revised rule, Ray submitted before the bench.

 On February 23, a division bench of Justice B. Bhattacharya had asked the government to remove the beacon from atop its vehicles and attach it to the front bumpers.

 Sick of the swelter? There is respite in sight, promises the weatherman.

 Heavy rainfall is likely in Calcutta and its adjoining areas in the next 36 hours, G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section, Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore, said on Monday.

 Met officials warned of widespread and heavy rains closer to the coast.

 Monday brought a bit of rain to the city as dark clouds gathered in the afternoon. The Met office recorded 0.7 mm of rainfall, but it drag down the Mercury by two degrees.

 Sundays deep depression over east-central Bay of Bengal intensified into a cyclonic storm and lay over east-central Bay of Bengal at 8.30 am on Monday about 750 kilometres south-east of Calcutta.

 Later in the evening, Met officials said the depression lay over east-central Bay of Bengal, 500 km off Calcutta. 

 This is likely to intensify further and move in a north, north-easterly direction and cross south Bangladesh and the adjoining coast by Tuesday afternoon, said an official.

 The weather office even warned of gale wind, touching 55 to 65 km per hour, in the next 24 hours. This could continue for 48 hours along and off the Bengal coast. Fishermen have been advised not to venture out into the sea.

 With heavy rains imminent, Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) officials were busy gearing up to tackle the threat of waterlogging.

 Monday saw a CMC team touring the citys 19 pumping stations following the Met office alert. The pumps are in order and we are ready to face any emergency, claimed Farzana Choudhury, member mayor-in-council (sewerage and drainage) of CMC.

 On May 8, the city had recorded 40.7 mm of rainfall, leading to pockets of waterlogging.

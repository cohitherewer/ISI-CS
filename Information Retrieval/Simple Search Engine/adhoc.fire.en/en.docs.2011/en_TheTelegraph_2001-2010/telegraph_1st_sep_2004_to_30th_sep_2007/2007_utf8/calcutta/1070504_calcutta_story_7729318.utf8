 Loan dupe nets 2 girls

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two young women were arrested at Agartala and Mumbai on charges of duping a central Calcutta-based trader of more than Rs 26 lakh with promises of arranging a bank loan. 

 The women had allegedly pretended to be executives of a private bank and promised to arrange a loan of Rs 2 crore for the trader, said sleuths of the detective departments bank fraud wing.

 In a modus operandi similar to that carried out a fortnight ago by Kuheli Chatterjee the 26-year-old woman from Behala, arrested on the charges of duping a trader of Rs 2.6 lakh the duo allegedly submitted forged loan documents of a Mumbai-based private bank to the businessman and took the money from him as commission for the approved loan deal. 

 I was looking for a bank loan and I had started contacting various banks and their agents. One day, the girls contacted me over the phone, said Bikas Biswas, the trader from the Jorasanko area, in his complaint. 

 Sleuths, hot on the trail, rounded up Panchali Deb Burma at Agartala a couple of days ago.

 After interrogating her, we learnt of her partner in crime, Paramita Chakraborty, who lived on Jogeshwari Link Road, in west Mumbai. A team of officers left for Mumbai and arrested Paramita on Wednesday, said an officer on the case.

 A month after contacting the trader, the two women had produced some fake papers, including a sanction letter, and claimed that the loan amount was soon to be disbursed.

 According to the deal, Biswas paid them the commission. But after a couple of weeks, he contacted the banks Calcutta branch, only to find that he had been duped, said the officer.

 Phone calls that promise

 pre-approved bank loans can land you in serious trouble,

 for banks give loans only after evaluating your credit-worthiness,

 warned the officer.

 Said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department): These women are from well-to-do families, and we suspect there are other people involved in this racket. We are trying to track them down.

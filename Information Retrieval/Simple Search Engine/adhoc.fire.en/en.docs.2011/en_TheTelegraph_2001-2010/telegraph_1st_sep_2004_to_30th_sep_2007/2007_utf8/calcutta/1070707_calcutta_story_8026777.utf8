 Girls of home ill after treat

 A STAFF REPORTER

 About 40 inmates of a girls home in Thakurpukur fell ill on Thursday night after eating confectionery distributed by a voluntary organisation. 

 Twelve of the residents of Welfare Association Home, on Rakhal Mukherjee Road, were admitted to Vidyasagar Hospital, in Behala, on Friday after their condition deteriorated. All, except one, are out of danger.

 According to Ashrukana Chakraborty, the superintendent of the home, members of the voluntary organisation had distributed the snacks, brought from a shop, on Thursday. 

 At night, some of the children complained of abdominal pain, accompanied by vomiting and loose motion. We called doctors and informed the civic body, which sent a health officer, she added.

 Nearly 300 destitute and orphan girls between five and 18 years of age stay in the government-aided home. It runs a Higher Secondary school, where the girls study.

 Local councillor Shyamadas Roy visited the home and made arrangements for testing the drinking water. It is pumped from a deep tubewell and stored in tanks.

 The superintendent told me that the tanks are regularly cleaned but we are not taking any chance, said Roy.

 He asked the superintendent to ensure the girls do not eat food from outside. 

 I have sent an adequate quantity of chira (beaten rice) and gur (molasses) to the home. We are trying to contact the organisation that had supplied the snacks, the councillor said.

 The superintendent said such an incident had never happened.

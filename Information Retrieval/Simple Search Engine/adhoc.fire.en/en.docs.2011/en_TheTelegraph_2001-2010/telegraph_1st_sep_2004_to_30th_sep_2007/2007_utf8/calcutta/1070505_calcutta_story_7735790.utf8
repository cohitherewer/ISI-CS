 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) gave the outdoor advertisement agencies a breather on Friday, following a warning by the East Calcutta Wetlands Management Authority to dismantle all billboards and displays immediately on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass between Nicco Park and Parama Island.

 In a meeting at the civic headquarters, the advertising agencies told the CMC that all the billboards could not be removed at once. They insisted that the sudden decision to remove the billboards could put the livelihood of many at stake. The civic body told them to submit their plea in writing. 

 We would like to have their views and opinions represented in writing, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay on Friday.

 The plea of the advertisers will be sent to the wetlands authority for consideration, Bandyopadhyay added.

 We might not take immediate action against them, but we have made it clear to these firms that they have to move away from the wetlands and the Bypass, said the municipal commissioner. 

 In March, the wetlands authority had ordered all outdoor advertising agencies to dismantle within a month all the 80-odd billboards dotting the Bypass between Nicco Park and Parama Island, to prevent pollution around the East Calcutta Wetlands.

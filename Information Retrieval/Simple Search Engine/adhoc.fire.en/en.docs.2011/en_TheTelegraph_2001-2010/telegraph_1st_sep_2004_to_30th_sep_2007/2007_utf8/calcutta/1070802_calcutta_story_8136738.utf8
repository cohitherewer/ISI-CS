The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 End of road for rickshaw

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has finally clamped a ban on hand-pulled rickshaws, which have been part of the city life for more than 100 years.

 The ban order was issued recently by home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray. Police have been asked to enforce the ban, Ray said on Wednesday.

 According to government estimates, there are more than 12,000 hand-pulled rickshaws, around 4,500 of them registered, in the city. 

 The government has been trying to phase out handpulled rickshaws for the past five years and has periodically threatened to stop renewing their licences.

 A final move to repeal the Hackney Carriage Act was made last year, with the introduction of the Calcutta Hackney Carriage Bill in the Assembly in November 2006. 

 The bill was passed in December last year, despite initial resistance from the Opposition, which had argued that the ban would leave several thousands jobless.

 The chief minister had made no secret of his dislike for hand-pulled rickshaws, which he claimed were clogging the already congested city streets.

 However, it is only six months ago that Calcutta police had stopped issuing licences to the rickshaws. 

 We had proposed that the government issue them licences to run some motorised means of transport, but our plea was ignored, said Intucs Pramathes Sen.

 Mukhtar Ali, of the West Bengal Rickshaw Pullers Union, said their association had filed a case in the high court against the government move.

 A case related to rehabilitation of the rickshaw-pullers is pending in the high court. We hope the government will take proper steps to rehabilitate the rickshaw-pullers, said Sabir Ahmed, of Calcutta Samaritans, which has been working with the rickshaw-pullers for the past decade.

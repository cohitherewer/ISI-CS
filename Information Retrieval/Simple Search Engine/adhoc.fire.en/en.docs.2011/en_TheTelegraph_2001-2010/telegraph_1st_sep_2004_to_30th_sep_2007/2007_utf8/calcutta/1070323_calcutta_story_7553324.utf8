The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cocktails, coffee and Cup

 - Party people gear up for a Friday night full of cricket fever

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Sachin vs Vaas. Sourav vs Murali. Zaheer vs Jayasuriya... Those are some of the symptoms for the Friday night fever set to grip the city. Yes, Calcutta will be glued to the screen the bigger the better as the Indians take the Queens Park Oval field for a winner-takes-it all tie.

 It is a crucial match for the team as well for us. The time, energy and money spent on the World Cup preparations will all go down the drain if we lose on Friday, says Amit Hathiramani of Underground and Virgose, at HHI. But for now, its party time in front of the flat-screen TVs. Bookings for the India vs Lanka match started three days ago. We are expecting a 400-plus footfall at Underground (where every Indian six and Sri Lankan wicket will signal a free round of beer). Some guests have even come in and asked for their favourite spots to sit and cheer Team India from.

 At Tantra and Aqua, where special projectors have been put in place for the big match, the crowd count is expected to be double that of any given Friday, says Namrata Ray at The Park.

 At standalone leisure addresses like Soho, on Sarat Bose Road, cricket mania is set to reach fever pitch on Friday. Around 140 prior bookings have been made by party people keen to watch the match beamed by two projectors and enjoy free shots of Indian Blue Flame cocktail for every six hit by an Indian batsman.

 From cocktails to coffee, theres no beating the cricket craze. Cafe Coffee Day, for instance, is padded up for a long night ahead. Says Sharan M H, regional head, east, CCD: At all our outlets we are expecting a footfall increase of 30 per cent from Friday evening.

 But for some like Avantika Kar, this is one Friday night when the party will be at home. My living room will turn into the action zone, with my brother and friends, says the 23-year-old software professional.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Culture call at tech college 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 From Bollywood chartbusters and headbangers ball to star turns on stage, Spring Fest 2007 at IIT Kharagpur, which took off on Thursday, promises a blast.

 The railway and tourism-themed fest was inaugurated by V.K. Raina, general manager, South Eastern Railway, followed by performances by singers Shivani Kashyap and the Band of Boys.

 By the afternoon of the first day, 250 students had registered, with more coming in as the day progressed. Students from Institute of Engineering and Management, BIT Mesra, have already registered, along with groups of five to six people from other colleges, said Yagnish Rathi, a student at IIT.

 The expected footfall at the four-day extravaganza sponsored by Airtel and Reliance Industries Ltd, with The Telegraph as the media partner, is around 12,000, including the students of IIT Kharagpur.

 The most popular event is Wildfire, the rock-band competition, with a registration of more than 40 bands. Out of these, 20 bands have been shortlisted for the prelims on a first-come-first-serve basis. 

 January 26 will begin with a Republic Day celebration at the Tagore Open Air Theatre (TOAT). But patriotic tunes will soon be replaced by hardcore rock with the prelims of Wildfire, which kicks off at 11 in the morning. 

 Delhi based rock group Prestorika will judge the event, which will continue for the next two days. Wildfire will end with a gala on the evening of January 28.

 Another crowd-puller on Friday will be the star night Pal, which will showcase a performance by Shaan. 

 The highlight of January 27 is Fine Frenzy, the fashion show, which will see colleges competing with each other. 

 The closing day of the cultural fest will be a frenzy, with Centrifuge, the dance competition, which will see 10 teams fighting it out, Nukkar, the street play competition, and debate. 

 The fest will come to an end with a bang with two star performances. Sarod siblings Amaan Ali Khan and Ayaan Ali Khan will take the stage at 5 pm.

 An hour later the finalists of Wildfire will take the stage followed by a performance by Prestorika.

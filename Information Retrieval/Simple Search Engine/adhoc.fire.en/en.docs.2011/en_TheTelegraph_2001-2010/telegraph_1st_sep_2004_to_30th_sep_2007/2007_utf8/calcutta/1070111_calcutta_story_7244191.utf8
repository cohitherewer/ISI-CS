 Voices on verses

 What is poetry? If you ask me, 

 I know not, if you do not ask, I know this was the general 

 perception of the participants at the UGC-sponsored national-level 

 seminar on Indian Poetry in English Many Voices and the 

 Problems of Canon held at Ramakrishna Mission College, 

 Narendrapur, in December. 

 The event was attended by litterateurs like Nirmal Kanti Bhattacharya from Sahitya Akademi, Niranjan Mohanty of Viswa Bharati University, Ranjit Hoskote, a Mumbai-based poet, Sumit Chakraborty of Rabindra Bharati University and Amit Chaudhuri, novelist and anthologist.

 The seminar began with Bhattacharya tracing the growth of Indian poetry, the problems of English becoming an increasingly popular medium of expression and the difficulty of anthologising todays Indian poetry in English.

 Jharna Sanyal, professor of English at CU, chaired the first session, between Mohanty and Hoskote. She spoke in defence of the early Indian poets writing in English. 

 Hoskote then articulated the anxiety of belonging a poet feels when he embarks upon composition. He said that anthologising and canon-forming are next to impossible because of the anthologists individual subjectivity.

 Mohanty, on the other hand, concentrated on whether or not Indians can write in English. Replied to the allegation that the early Indian writers in English were imitators of the West, he reasoned that imitation was necessary because the early Indian poets had no Indian tradition of English poetry to build on.

 The second session was presided over by Swapan Chakravorty, professor of JU, and Arya Ghosh from the host institution. Sumit Chakraborty presented their papers.

 Ghosh deliberated on the role of anthologies in canon formation. He pointed out the elements of assumption and judgment that are inherent in the task of preparing an anthology. On a different note, Swapan Chakravorty spoke on the poetry of Lakshmi Kannan and the emergence of the woman poet.

 In the final session, Chaudhuri spoke about the thought process behind the making of his Picador anthology.

 Before wrapping up the seminar, the principal of the host college, Swami Suparnananda, said: Poetry is an echo asking the shadow to dance.

 THE DIARY 

 Living a lie

 Dream on, you silly child, 

 it shall not last.

 What stories have you been told

 of far, far away?

 Dragons, unicorns, magic wands...

 What will happen when you know,

 that they dont exist?

 That they were red hot lies

 That youve been fed since you were a child?

 What do you do, when you realise

 that your whole life has been 

 a finely woven web of lies?

 Those simple lies that you were told...

 so that you did not cry?

 You cried, nevertheless...

 You cried aloud when your peacock died...

 and also when the sun didnt shine when you wanted 

 it to.

 Was it worth it?

 Was it worth telling you stories that would silence

 you momentarily

 but haunt you till the end of time?

 Sealed cynicism

 The sky trembles, the earth 

 shrinks an inch, 

 woe covered hills shift focus to 

 the dull moon hovering over the night sky. 

 The ravens prey over human sentiments, 

 over raw blood, over us.

 Silence that persisted has been woken

 by the glaring eyes searching for vulnerability

 Skies seem to be shattering,

 blinking, dropping tears,

 then thundering fears away.

 Mutilated shadows, sabotaged happiness,

 peeled off skins, slaughtered beliefs

 haunt my days, follow my nights,

 bring forth, light to thee

 Barkha Sharda, 

 JU

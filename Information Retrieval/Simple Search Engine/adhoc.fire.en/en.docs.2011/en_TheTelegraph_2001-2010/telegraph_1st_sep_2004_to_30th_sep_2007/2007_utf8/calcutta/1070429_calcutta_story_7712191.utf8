 Waste

 Stat Talk 

 Three thousand metric tonnes or 3,000,000 kilograms. The waste that Calcutta produces. It is dumped into 350 open vats and as many closed ones. There is a system of collecting waste from households, but that is not followed in many places.

 About half of the waste is biodegradable the waste from markets and kitchens; 30-35 per cent debris and the rest 20-25 per cent is non-biodegradable waste dominated by, you have guessed right, plastic.

 Where does the garbage go? Till now to Dhapa area on the eastern fringes, but that can hardly absorb waste for another couple of years. Dhapa II is in the pipeline.

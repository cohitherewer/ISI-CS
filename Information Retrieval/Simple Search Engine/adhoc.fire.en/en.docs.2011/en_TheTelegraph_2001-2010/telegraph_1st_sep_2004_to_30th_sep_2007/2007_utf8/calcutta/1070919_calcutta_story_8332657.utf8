 Firing at factory off port

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Jawans of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) fired two rounds in the air late on Monday to scare away a group of criminals when they tried to enter an abandoned factory in the port area. The criminals managed to give the jawans the slip.

 The deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), Gyanwant Singh, said the incident took place around 11.50pm. The criminals assembled in front of an abandoned factory on Garden Reach Road with an intention to steal scrap from the premises, he said.

 According to the officers of South Port police station, who were patrolling the area, they heard the sound of firing and blowing of whistles. The sound seemed to come from the factory. We immediately rushed there, said an officer.

 At the factory gate, the officers met the CISF personnel, who told them why they had opened fire. We alerted the police vehicles patrolling the area. But our efforts to track down the gang proved futile, added the officer.

 Singh said theft attempts at abandoned factories in the port area have become common. There are a number of places in the area where criminals can either take refuge or hide stolen goods. We have drawn up a list of 22 such places and will soon raid them, he added.

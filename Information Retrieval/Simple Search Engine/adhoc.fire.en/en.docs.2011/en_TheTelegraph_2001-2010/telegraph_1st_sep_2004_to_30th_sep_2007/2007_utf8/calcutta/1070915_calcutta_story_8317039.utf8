 The other Gandhi

 Oxford Bookstore, in collaboration with Orient Longman, presents the launch of C.B.Dalals book, Harilal Gandhi: A Life, translated into English by Tridip Suhrud. The author has been posthumously awarded a major literary prize in Ahmedabad on September 14 by Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi and Mahasweta Devi. Apart from the life of Harilal Gandhi as chronicled by Dalal, Suhrud has also included 12 appendices consisting hitherto unpublished letters and archival material. Harilal, the eldest son of Mahatma Gandhi, remains to this day a mysterious figure and the subject of much speculation in recent times.The book attempts to bring Harilal Gandhi out to the shadow of his illustrious father. A copy of the book will be presented by Mahasweta Devi to Gopalkrishna Gandhi, nephew of Harilal Gandhi. Excerpts from the book will be read by theatre personalities Dolly Basu and Dhruv Mukherjee, and by Feroz Abbas Khan, director of Gandhi:My Father, a film based on Harilals life.

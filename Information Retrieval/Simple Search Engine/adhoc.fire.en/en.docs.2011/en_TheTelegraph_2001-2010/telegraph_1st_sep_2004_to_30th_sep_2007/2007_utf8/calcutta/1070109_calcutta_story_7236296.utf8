 Armymen complain, cops crow

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The complaint lodged by Major Chandra Pratap Singh and Captain Mahesh at Park Street police station on January 5, alleging that they were beaten up by cops on New Years Eve, has strengthened Calcutta Polices case against the army. 

 The complaint indicates that the army officers were present at the police station on December 31 night when a brawl broke out there a fact that the cops would have otherwise struggled to prove.

 The complaint also raises the question why the army officers took four days to lodge a complaint with police.

 In keeping with the law, one would have to justify why there was a delay in lodging the complaint. It will not be easy to explain the delay. If the army officers were, indeed, beaten up, why did they wait so long to lodge a complaint? asked city detective chief Gyanwant Singh.

 The complaint has another implication for the cops. 

 We would like to know from the complainants what exactly had happened. If they turn up to explain their role in the incident, we may arrest them, since they are also the accused, said an officer probing the case.

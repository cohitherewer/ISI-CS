The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Beauty of brick, mortar 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Does architecture have to be timeless? Can the quality of our built spaces bring about better bonding? How do we make our buildings behave or react well to the streetscape where they sit?

 Posers that swirled around the packed Atira auditorium in Ahmedabad recently could be asked in any urban context. What makes 12 on 12 special though, is the overwhelming response from students, a phenomenon the architects fraternity in Calcutta craves.

 A time to introspect and learn from peers. Thats the seminal basis of 12 on 12, a unique daylong conclave held in the Gujarat capital every December that allows architects to share concerns, listen, contemplate and improve. The first 12 on 12 was held on March 12, 2005. Twelve minutes on Twelfth of March. Hence, 12 on 12.

 About 40 architects come to Ahmedabad, on their own steam, for a day (usually a Saturday before Christmas) and present to an audience of about 400-425 architects, from across the country.

 They are free to decide the content and nature of their presentation in a timeframe of 12 minutes. Its a platform shorn of trappings, that treats all of us for what we are architects searching for ways to deal with our realities every day, every moment, explains landscape architect Aniket Bhagwat, the prime mover.

 Its a wonderful opportunity to soak in new trends and also to network, says CEPT (Center for Environmental Planning and Technology) Ahmedabad student Hiral Katkoria. She was among the lucky batch, which could attend, while hundreds of other students, equally keen, couldnt be accommodated.

 Senior architect Dulal Mukherjee, one of the two participants from Calcutta, was moved by the students intense enthusiasm. This is mind-boggling and it would be great if we could replicate this in Calcutta. We need our students to be more proactive and open to inputs, he says.

 Gita Balakrishnan, the other presenter from Calcutta, agrees. I had the opportunity to visit architecture and design workshops in Dhaka. Even there, I found the students really motivated, something we can hardly guarantee in Calcutta, she observes.

 Calcutta-based architect Mukul Mitra admits students involvement in Calcutta for a similar event would struggle to match Ahmedabads, and feels the primary fault lies with the faculty, which hasnt been able to inspire students.

 Mitra opines architecture students in Bengal tend to have an engineering bias, while betraying a generic lack of aesthetics. This is not unusual, since architecture here is taught in engineering colleges, unlike CEPT or SPA Delhi, where the stress is more on design, he says.

 City architect and urban designer Partha Ranjan Das laments the lax attitude of teachers here. At CEPT, faculty and students are like a family and the active exchange of ideas contributes to better design concepts, he points out.

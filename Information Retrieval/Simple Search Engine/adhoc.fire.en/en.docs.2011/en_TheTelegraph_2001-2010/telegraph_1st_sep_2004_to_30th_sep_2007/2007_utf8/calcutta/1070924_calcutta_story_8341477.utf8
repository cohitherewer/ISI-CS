 Mountain man on marathon trail

 Malli Mastan Babu atop Africas highest peak in Tanzania

 Malli Mastan Babu is on a roll. The IIT and IIM alumnus summited the seven tallest peaks in the seven continents in 2006, did a 900-km trek of Gangotri-Yamunotri-Kedarnath-Badrinath in July and followed it up with an expedition to Mt Kilimanjaro last month. He has now set his sights on completing a mega marathon. 

 Starting February 1, 2008, he plans to run 29 marathons in 29 consecutive days in the 28 states and Delhi.

 It is the challenge of stretching his limit that eggs on the 33-year-old from Andhra Pradesh. I wanted to do something new after the mountains. I had read a book about an American woman walking a billion mile across the US. People think Im crazy for making such an attempt, but I know what I am capable of, he says.

 Babu plans to run half marathons in 15 states, including West Bengal, between October 20 to November 3, to practise for his attempt. He will run 21 km every day, starting at Sandakphu and ending at Hyderabad.

 It is a hectic itinerary. Babu will get to recover from the four-hour runs only during the journey to the next stop. He wants to touch the major cities in each state. In Uttar Pradesh, I want to run in Agra, while in Jharkhand, I plan to run past Dasham Falls in Ranchi.

 Babu is in Sandakphu from Friday. He will practise there for the half-marathons till October 18. Running the nearly 13-km stretch from Sandakphu to Phalut, through rugged terrain at a height of above 10,000 ft, with oxygen supply half of that in the plains, he feels, will equip him for the challenge. I will find it easier to run in the plains under normal conditions, after training under harsh conditions. The capacity of my lungs will increase and the steep gradient will strengthen the muscles for the run in the plains.

 Through the marathon, Mastan wants to send out a message for a healthier India. I will be running 21 km a day. If people cover the same distance in a week, be it running, walking or jogging, it will make a difference to the quality of their lives.

 Babu, who has a postgraduate diploma in business management from IIM Calcutta and an engineering degree from IIT Kharagpur, has no plans of climbing the corporate ladder. Since passing out from the IIM in 2004, he has concentrated on mountaineering. His dream is to set up an institute that will provide corporate training through adventure sports. Once Babu finishes the mega marathon, hed like to set off for a trek to the Everest base camp.

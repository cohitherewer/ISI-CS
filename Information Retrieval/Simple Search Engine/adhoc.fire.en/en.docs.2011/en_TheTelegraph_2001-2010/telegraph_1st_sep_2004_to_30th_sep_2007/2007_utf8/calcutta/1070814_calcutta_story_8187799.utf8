The three employees of McDonalds who were injured in Sundays explosion have been shifted from SSKM Hospital to Woodlands nursing home in a critical condition.

 The fourth injured Ashoke Dhanuka, 35, a contract labourer working at the Park Street outlet was still lying on the floor of the emergency observation ward of SSKM on Monday afternoon. 

 A McDonalds official had said on Sunday that Dhanukas employer Ashok De would take care of him.

 The McDonalds authorities contacted Woodlands on Sunday evening and ambulances were immediately sent to SSKM to shift Sanjit Biswal, 25, Subhas Mani Rai, 24, and Bijan Biswas, 23.

 All three, suffering from critical burns, are under strict medical vigilance, said Sumedha Sen, the chief executive officer of the clinic.

 A doctor at Woodlands said: They are being administered intravenous fluids and antibiotics. The three had sustained burns in the eyes, and on the face and torso. They may have to be taken to the operating theatre for proper treatment of the wounds.

 The three, along with Dhanuka, were rushed to SSKM after the blast. Later, Ajitabh Jha, the restaurant manager, said they were planning to shift Biswal, Rai and Biswas to a nursing home or another hospital.

 Binod Tamang, the brother-in-law of Rai, said not a single doctor had attended to the victim in the 12 hours he had been at SSKM.

 Lying on the emergency floor, Dhanuka said: My employer did not turn up today. A doctor said: He has fractures in both legs, and a few injuries on his face and head. We have done a CT scan and a neurologist will be consulted.

 SSKM superintendent Ashoke Ghosh had claimed that the injured were getting proper treatment.

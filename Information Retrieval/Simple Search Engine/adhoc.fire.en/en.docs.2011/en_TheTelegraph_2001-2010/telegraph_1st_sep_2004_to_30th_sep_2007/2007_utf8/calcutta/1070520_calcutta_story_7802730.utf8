 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Lachung

 A picturesque village named after a river in the lap of the eastern Himalayas, Lachung is now a favourite holiday destination of nature-lovers. It offers the bliss of solitude to the weary city soul.

 The hamlet is situated at a height of over 8,000 ft in north-east Sikkim, near the border with China, about 121 km from Gangtok. A visit to the area is almost a botanical odyssey due to the wide variety of flora and fauna found there.

 The village, spread out on either side of the river Lachung, has managed to retain its unique culture and tradition. The roads are fringed with towering pine trees. The changing hues of the snow-capped mountains take your breath away.

 The army has a base in Lachung. Before the annexation of Tibet, the village served as a trading post. Tourism has been driving the villages economy in the last few years. People from all over the world visit Lachung between October and May. There is generally heavy snowfall during winter.

 The inhabitants are of Nepalese and Tibetan descent. Lachung Monastery, on the slope opposite to the highway, is where they hold their religious functions. If you can, drop in at the monastery during a religious function. 

 Yumthang is about 24 km from Lachung. The valley is known for its natural beauty. Yumthang is also the home of Shingbha Rhododendron Sanctuary, which has 24 species of the flower. There are also several varieties of orchid and poppy. Katao, which is every bit as beautiful as Yumthang, is another must-visit.

 Going 

 Jeeps are available from Gangtok to Lachung. You will have to rely on the jeeps for sightseeing. The airport nearest to Gangtok is Bagdogra. The nearest railhead is New Jalpaiguri. Buses are regularly available to Gangtok from Siliguri. It takes about four hours to reach Gangtok. Cars are also available on hire

 Staying 

 There are several hotels at Lachung. Alpine Resort, Primula Lodge and River View Lodge are some of the options

 On your grades, go

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The state government is on its marks to get the grade system going from Madhyamik 2008.

 The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education has called a meeting of its executive committee on February 2 to finalise the decision on assessing Madhyamik examinees with grades, not marks.

 The proposal on introducing the grades system is the main issue on the agenda, said Ujwal Basu, board president. We have completed the process of examining all sides. The board will announce the details after the meeting. 

 The new system will award students grades and marks in individual subjects, but the aggregate or a division will not be mentioned in the report cards. This is expected to ease a lot of exam-related stress and end an admission process where just one mark in the aggregate can prove crucial.

 The February 2 meeting will decide on which scale the grades would be divided, said an official of the state school education department.

 Grades, instead of marks, were introduced in Higher Secondary this year. In its wake, the state government directed the secondary board to begin the process of establishing parity between the two boards. 

 The secondary board held a meeting with representatives of several teachers bodies last October for their opinion, particularly on the scale for dividing the grades.

 Their views will be discussed at our meeting on February 2, said board president Basu.

 While some teachers organisations suggested a 10/12-point scale, the CPM-controlled All Bengal Teachers Association (ABTA), the largest schoolteachers body, has proposed a nine-point scale, sources in the board said. The higher secondary council has adopted a five-point scale.

 Since Madhyamik involves a larger number of students than Higher Secondary, a nine-point scale will be appropriate, said Shibaprasad Mukhopadhyay, ABTA general secretary.

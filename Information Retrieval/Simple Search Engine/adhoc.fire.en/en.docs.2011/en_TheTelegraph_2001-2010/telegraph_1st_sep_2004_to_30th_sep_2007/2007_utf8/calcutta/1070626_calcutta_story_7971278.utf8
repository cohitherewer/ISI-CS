 Enlivening Bengali culture

 Directed by Anjan Dutt, The Bong Connection is the story of two young men trying to achieve their dreams in a foreign land. For one, Calcutta is dying and stagnant. For the other, it is still the Mecca of culture and arts. It presents two stories that run parallel, never quite merging yet colliding. A warm-hearted, hilarious yet deeply touching drama about two men in this crazy, global world, it takes a sensitive look at the city and its denizens and the changes they have been adjusting to over the years. To coincide with the release of The Bong Connection, Moxie Entertainments, Open Doors and Tollygunge Club present a quintessentially Bong pursuit, an adda session, Our Second Cultural Renaissance The Bong Connection. Participants: Dhritiman Chatterji, Suvaprasanna Bhattacharya, Barun Chanda, Anjan Dutt, Arindam Sil, Oindrilla Dutt, Shayan Munshi, Peeya Rai Chowdhuri. Topic: Brain Drain The Bong Connection. The adda will be interspersed with live performances by Anjan and Neel Dutt, from the films hugely popular music, which has just been released.

 Event: Adda and music performance When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Oxford Bookstore, Park Street

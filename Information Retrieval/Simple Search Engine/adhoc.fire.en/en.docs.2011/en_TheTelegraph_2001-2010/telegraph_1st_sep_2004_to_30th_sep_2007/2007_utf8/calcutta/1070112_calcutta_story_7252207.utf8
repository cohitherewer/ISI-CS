Screen On amp; Off

 Releasing this Friday along with Guru is an all-action chick flick called DOA Dead or Alive. Distributed here by INOX, the film directed by Corey Yuen is based on a popular computer game and stars Holly Valance, Sarah Carter, Jaime Pressley and Devon Aoki.

 The story revolves around a number of fighters who are invited to DOA, a mega martial arts contest. Fighters are pooled against one another in a knock-out style tournament, with the loser of a battle sent home, and the winner progressing to the subsequent round. The film focuses on four female fighters who begin as rivals, but subsequently find themselves teaming up against a force of evil.

 Its hot sexy women who are strong and independent and feisty and all very individual, with their personality and the way they dress; they are tough girls, feels Pressley about DOA.

 All the characters are really fantastical, Aoki, whose younger brother is a big fan of the game. We all have different colours of hair and we wear different sorts of costumes and the fight scenes are amazing.

 Says director Yuen of the flesh-and-fist film: Its quite difficult to have a movie that is very similar to a game. But this movie is actually very alive. Its much more human than the game is which is from the computer, or the Xbox really. What I really wanted to capture of the game was the spirit, the liveliness and the energy.

 Riverbanks are known to be cradles of civilisation and what better way to set forth on a cultural mission than a cruise along the ghats in the city?

 To promote research in Indian art, culture and spirituality, Jnana-Pravaha, a 10-year-old centre for cultural studies based in Varanasi, is expanding operations to Calcutta. It already has branches in Mumbai and Delhi.

 Its a way of stimulating the thoughts of the younger generation and allowing them to learn differently through seminars, heritage visits and interactive sessions, said Madhu Neotia, director of Jnana-Pravaha, Calcutta. 

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay started proceedings at the inaugural ceremony of the Calcutta chapter. A pair of dhakis welcomed guests to MV Pari before it set sail on the Hooghly.

 After introductory talks by Bimla Poddar and Suresh Neotia, founder-members of Jnana-Pravaha in Varanasi, Bandopadhyay spoke on history of the ghats along the river and the heritage structures in the vicinity.

 The guest list included historians, architects, teachers, artists, writers and environmentalists. They took part in an interactive session on beautification of the ghats and contributed ideas on how to boost the cultural scene in the city.

 Europe on the Ganges, a documentary by Intach, and another film on the French settlement in Chandernagore, by Payal Mohanka, were screened on the lower deck of the launch. An exhibition of pictures of European settlements on the banks of the Hooghly was also organised.

 Some of the guests joined in with the bauls who entertained the audience as the launch steered past Prinsep, Chandpal, Nimtala, Ahiritola, Bandha, Cossipore and Botanical Garden ghats. 

 Jnana-Pravaha has planned several programmes on performing arts, photography, theatre, textiles, arts and crafts from March, starting with a workshop on restoration and conservation of valuables.

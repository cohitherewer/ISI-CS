 Directive on ICSE papers

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Close on the heels of the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education, the Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (ICSE) has come under the Calcutta High Court scanner.

 Justice Tapen Sen passed an order on Tuesday directing the council to preserve the physics and chemistry scripts of Madhushree Acharya, a student of St Teresas School, Kidderpore, who appeared for her ICSE this year. 

 Madhushrees father, Arun Acharya, had moved a petition before the court stating that his daughter, who had been a meritorious student throughout school, was not satisfied with her ICSE marks.

 Acharyas lawyer, Bilwadal Bhattacharya, said: Madhushree got 90 per cent marks in all the subjects, but scored only 64 and 72 in physics and chemistry, respectively.

 Madhushree wanted her papers to be reviewed and deposited a sum of Rs 400 for each paper as caution money.

 A few days later, the school authorities sent her a letter saying that only eight marks had been increased in her physics paper, while her marks in chemistry remained unaltered, said Bhattacharya.

 Madhushree then urged the school authorities to take steps so that her answer scripts could be reviewed again. They allegedly refused.

 On being asked to produce the answer scripts before the court, the lawyer representing the ICSE authorities said that the answer scripts may have been destroyed 60 days after the publication of results, according to regulations of the council.

 Acharyas lawyer, however, argued that as Madhushree had demanded a further review of her answer scripts, the council may have preserved them.

 The matter will come up for hearing again after the Puja vacation of the court.

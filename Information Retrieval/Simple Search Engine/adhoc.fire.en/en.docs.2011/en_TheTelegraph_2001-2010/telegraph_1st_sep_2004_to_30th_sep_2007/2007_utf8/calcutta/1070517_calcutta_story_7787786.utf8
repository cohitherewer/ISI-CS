 Wife role in murder rejected

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Wednesday absolved a 30-year-old woman of the charges of being involved in her husbands murder.

 Laxmi Das, languishing in jail for seven years, had been been sentenced to life imprisonment by the Alipore court for being involved in the murder of husband Tapan.

 But a division bench of Justice A.K. Basu and Justice K.D. Mukherjee of the high court observed: The prosecution has failed to prove that Laxmi was involved in the murder. We set aside the order of the trial court. She should be released soon.

 According to the case diary, Pappu Singh, Manoj Rajak and Debi Patra had entered Tapans house in Cossipore on July 30, 2000, and shot him dead.

 Tapans brother Debu lodged a complaint with Shyampukur police station, alleging that Laxmi had illicit relations with all three. She had masterminded the murder, Debu had alleged.

 The four were arrested on September 2, 2000. The trial started before the first magistrate of Alipore court. The magistrate delivered his verdict on January 24, 2005, pronouncing the four guilty and sentencing them to life imprisonment.

 Laxmis lawyer argued in the high court: Debu had a motive behind lodging the complaint against Laxmi. Tapan and Laxmi had no child. He thought he could grab their property if Laxmi could be put behind bars.

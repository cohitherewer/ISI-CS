The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Bodhgaya

 The journey from Gaya to Bodhgaya is memorable. The 12-km road is bordered by clusters of hillocks and lush green forests of Sal, Segun, Palash, Kendu and Akashmoni. River Falgu, too, flows by the side of the road. 

 In contrast to Gaya, Bodhgaya is clean, green and quiet. There are temples and monasteries in every part of the town.

 Bodhgaya is where Buddha attained nirvana and hence is a popular pilgrimage spot. Emperor Ashok had visited the town. In more recent times, the Dalai Lama is a prominent visitor. He stays a month at Bodhgaya every winter. 

 Bodhibriksha, the tree under which Buddha is believed to have meditated, can still be seen. The red sandstone on which he sat is referred to as the diamond throne by the pilgrims. 

 A fair is organised here in May, during Buddha Jayanti. But the best time to visit Bodhgaya is November to March, when the weather is most pleasant. 

 One of the most visited tourist spots in the town is the 180-ft high Mahabodhi temple. It is an architectural beauty with a golden statue of Buddha in the basement.

 The temple was renovated by a Bengali curator named Raja Rajendralal Mitra with financial help from General Cunningham in 1880. There is a lake near the temple. Magadh University was set up on its banks.

 Among the temples and monasteries in Bodhgaya, the Tibetan, Thai and the Bhutanese monasteries and the Chinese Buddhist temple are the most well-known. Most of the structures are architectural landmarks.

 The Bhutanese monastery looks like a pagoda. The Thai monastery was built in 1967 with financial assistance from the government of Thailand. Most of the monasteries remain open from 10 am to 5 pm, except Friday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A business house, a park to tend

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has decided to rope in private parties for better management of the 500-odd parks it owns in the city.

 Industrialist Pawan Ruia and Bengal Shelter Housing Development have already agreed to take up the responsibility of two parks, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said on Tuesday.

 While Ruia is interested in Maddox Square, managing director of Bengal Shelter Housing Development Samar Nag has written to the CMC, asking for Citizens Park.

 The civic body has spent around Rs 10 crore on Citizens Park and Rs 50 crore to raise a rose garden at Maddox Square.

 Talking about the new policy, being loosely called One park to one business house, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said: If private parties come forward and share the burden of the upkeep of the parks, we will be able to set up more parks in the city. Well-maintained parks are what we need to keep the citys environment clean.

 Municipal commissioner Bandyopadhyay said most parks and squares in the city are in a state of neglect. A good number of them have turned into no-mans land, thanks to decades of neglect.

 We want to deck them up anew with help from private parties, he said.

 The civic authorities, however, have made it clear that a private party taking over a park will not be allowed to charge entry fees, no matter how much money it spends for beautification.

 There are now more than 500 small and big parks maintained by the CMC. Three more are coming up in Bijoygarh and Sarsuna this year.

 Mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan said it is not possible for the 250 gardeners hired by the CMC to look after so many parks.

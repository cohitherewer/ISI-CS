The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 For the love of the game

 Todays question: Will the Nehru Cup victory revive the spirit of football in the city? 

More letters will be published next week

 WE ASK, YOU ANSWER

 Skipper Bhaichung Bhutia lands in Calcutta with the ONGC Nehru Cup trophy (PTI) 

 Paramananda Pal, Karaya Road

 Defeating Syria in the final of Nehru Cup is indeed a turning point in the history of Indian soccer. Our soccer is way behind compared to teams of other countries yet Bhaichung Bhutias team can now definitely look forward to gaining in strength and spirit to challenge the other powerful teams of the world. 

 Manash Kumar Das, Behala

 Winning a tournament does not mean there will be a revival of football in the city. The grounds on which our football matches are played, especially during the monsoons, speak volumes about the local administration and management. This victory will help only in increasing the popularity of Bhaichung. 

 Subhankar mandal, Palta

 The victory of India in the Nehru Cup will definitely boost football in the city. Football is still the most loved game in the city, but the national team losing in international matches dampens the spirit of spectators. But this victory has given a new lease of life to the game and its lovers which might go a long way in reviving interest in football.

 Subhobrata Basu, Ballygunge Station Road

 The Nehru Cup victory will definitely catapult Indian football to new heights. We need to be consistent and more ruthless on the field. Bob Houghton, the Indian coach, should ensure discipline in the camp, but given the present scenario I am pretty sure that Indian football is moving in the right direction. 

 Muddasir Zafar, Narkeldanga

 The history of football in Bengal dates back to the pre-Independence era. But the status of this game could not be maintained due to poor infrastructure and inadequate coaching facilities. The Nehru Cup victory will revive the fanfare associated with this game in Calcutta. 

 Debashish Chakraborty, Chandni Chowk

 The Nehru Cup win will definitely boost the spirit of budding footballers of Bengal. Bhaichung Bhutia has created history and the golden era of Indian football is surely going to be revived.

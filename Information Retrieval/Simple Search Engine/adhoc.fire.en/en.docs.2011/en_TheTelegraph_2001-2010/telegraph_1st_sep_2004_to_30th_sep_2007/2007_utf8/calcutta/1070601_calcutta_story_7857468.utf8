The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Scurry for seats in mission admission

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 With more than 2.5 lakh students successfully clearing the Plus II hurdle of various boards and eyeing a little over a lakh seats in colleges in and around Calcutta, the battle for admissions is on this summer. 

 The final leg of mission admission will start on Friday, with Calcutta University (CU) having directed that the process be kicked off within 24 hours of the publication of the higher secondary results. 

 But getting admission into the college of choice will not be easy. The number of applicants in top colleges in Calcutta is growing every year and there is a big rush, admitted Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor, academic affairs, CU. 

 According to CU estimates, the 102-odd colleges in the city can accommodate around a lakh students. In 2006, some 2.5 lakh students (from ISC, CBSE and HS) took part in the admission race and the scene will be much the same this summer. 

 The message from the top colleges is clear students scoring 85 per cent or above need not worry. But those in the middle order will find it difficult to pursue preferred courses in premier colleges. 

 The reason is simple There has been a steady increase in the number of high performers, but there are very few good colleges in the city, said a university official. 

 According to Mamata Roy, principal, Presidency College, the number of applications to study honours courses in subjects like economics, chemistry, geography and biological sciences like zoology, botany and physiology are increasing every year. 

 We were forced to deny admission to many deserving aspirants last year for not having an adequate number of seats, said Roy, principal of one the most sought-after colleges in the city. 

 St Xaviers, Asutosh College and Lady Brabourne College also feature on the list of premier colleges. 

 The admission heat can also be felt on the Jadavpur University campus. The rush will be more this time, as the CBSE and ISC results have already shown an upward trend in pass percentage But we cannot increase seats just like that, said Sidhartha Dutta, pro vice-chancellor, Jadavpur University. 

 Some colleges have decided to do their bit to resolve the seat crisis. We have increased our seats in some of our most sought-after subjects, like English, computer science and mathematics, announced Manimala Das, principal, Bethune College.

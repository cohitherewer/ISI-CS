 The retail chains in the city now have an American rival. Californias My Dollarstore Inc. has opened its first outlet in Calcutta at New Market. 

 The 1,200-sq-ft shop, advertised as the original American bargain store, is selling a variety of products imported from the US, the UK and China. All the items are priced at Rs 99.

 The chain has a range of stores in low-rent malls in the US where the items are priced at $1. The transportation cost and import tariff have pushed the price up to Rs 99 here.

 Hersheys chocolate syrup, non-cholesterol cookies, shampoos and cosmetics have emerged as the most popular items, said Ajay Kumar Shaw, manager of the My Dollarstore franchise in India. We keep changing our stocks to check what clicks with the customers.

 A trip to the shop reminded me of my country. Its nice to see the store in Calcutta. The products are almost the same, but the price is higher here, said Andrea Dankert, a US tourist in the city. 

 Local customers, though, are wary of the low price. I am here to check out the stuff. Lets see if they are as good as they seem to be, said a customer.The products are more varied in Calcutta than in Bangalore, stated Ida Gnanaraj, a housewife, who has visited the chains outlet in the south Indian city.

 In an attempt to encourage customers to try unfamiliar products like blueberry syrup, My Dollarstore offers a money-back guarantee, no questions asked. One customer returned a partially-eaten jar of peanut butter and a used shampoo bottle, said a salesperson. 

 Why did the chain choose New Market over other malls to open its store? New Market has one of the highest footfall figures among shopping destinations across India. This prompted us to set up the store there. It wasnt a mistake, said Shaw. 

 Tirtha Das, a customer care associate at the store, claimed: About 700 people visit the shop every day. 

 My Dollarstore plans to open four more outlets in the city at South City mall, Lake Mall, Mani Square in Salt Lake and Howrah by the end of the year.

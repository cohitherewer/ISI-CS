 - ACTION PLAN YOKE ON SCHOOLS

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state government on Thursday decided to prepare an action plan to stop corporal punishment of students in schools.

 It will also restructure its school-inspection network to enforce the ban on corporal punishment, announced several years ago but violated rampantly.

 The government will immediately intervene if there is a complaint of a student being beaten up by a teacher, school education minister Partha De said.

 The move is primarily aimed at all government or state-aided schools, though private institutions, too, are expected to abide by the rule.

 De on Thursday met senior officials of his department, the authorities of the state primary and secondary education boards and representatives of various teachers bodies to discuss details of the action plan.

 De said the government will spread awareness against corporal punishment among all those involved with the school education system, including teachers, students and parents.

 Psychological counselling of teachers and students, training teachers in anger management and increased participation of parents in the running of schools are likely to figure in the plan.

 A particular student may not be intelligent and he/she may take a little more time than other boys and girls to learn a lesson. The teacher should understand that a child does not commit an offence by not being able to do well in studies, the minister asserted.

 At the same time, he pointed out, parents must realise that it is the duty of the teacher to impart quality education to every student.

 The teachers associations have been asked to suggest by September 30 how best the ban on corporal punishment can be enforced. The action plan will be framed after that.

 The curtains came down on the Book Fair on Sunday, but with a pledge by the chief minister to see the curtains come up again at a venue better than this. 

 Organisers Publishers and Booksellers Guild, too, resolved to shift the Book Fair out of Salt Lake stadium following an hour-long meeting with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. He had dropped in at the fair to take stock of affairs. 

 The chief minister shares our concern about the lack of space at the stadium. He asked us to start preparations for the next Book Fair within the next few days so that it is held on schedule. He will soon visit New Delhi, where he will to take up the issue of holding the Book Fair on the Maidan, said general secretary of the guild Tridib Chatterjee.

 The sales figures at the Book Fair dropped by almost 40 per cent compared with last year. Even the turnout was lower than last years fair. There are reasons for us to be concerned, added Chatterjee.

 According to the guild officials, the venue for next years fair must be well-connected, should offer space for free movement and scope to set-up stalls in an organised manner. If the 28 acres on the Maidan are not available, the organisers are ready to settle for a 22-25 acre plot elsewhere.

 The permanent fairground project seems mired in controversy, with chunks of land locked in litigation. If these tracts are made available, holding the Book Fair there shouldnt be a problem. Things, however, dont look bright now, said a senior member of the guild.

 The 2008 Book Fair will be held from January 30 to February 10. It will be inaugurated on January 29. The theme will be the US. A number of Nobel laureates are expected to attend the fair.

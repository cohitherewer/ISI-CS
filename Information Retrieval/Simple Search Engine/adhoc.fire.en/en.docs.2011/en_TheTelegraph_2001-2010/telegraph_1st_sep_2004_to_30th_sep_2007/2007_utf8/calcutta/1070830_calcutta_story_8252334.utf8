Postgraduate students of Rajabazar Science College have threatened to lodge a complaint with the University Grants Commission (UGC) against the move by the Calcutta Universitys SFI-controlled students union to force freshers to disclose their political leanings.

 The students want to mention in the complaint how the union was allowed to use the office of the universitys science secretary, Shyamal Sarkar, for distributing the forms. 

 The forms contain questions about newcomers links with unions at the undergraduate level and their involvement in social activities. 

 Suranjan Das, the pro vice- chancellor (academic affairs) of the university and a member of the UGC executive committee, said he was unaware of the details of the matter. We are looking into it. The UGC usually does not interfere into the internal problems of state-aided universities, he said.

 Subhankar Sarkar, a Chhatra Parishad leader, said: We will meet state higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri and university vice-chancellor Asis Kumar Banerjee and lodge complaints with them. 

 The SFI leaders of the university, however, maintained that they have not violated rules. It is important to assess how politically aware the new students are. This way it is easier for us to reach out to them, said Sanhita Bhattacharya, the joint secretary of the Calcutta Universitys local committee.

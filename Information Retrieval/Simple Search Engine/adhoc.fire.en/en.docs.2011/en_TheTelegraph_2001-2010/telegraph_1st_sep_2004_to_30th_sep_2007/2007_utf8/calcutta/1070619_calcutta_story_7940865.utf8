 Hard line on felling

 Bengal forest minister Ananta Roy plans to go tough against people felling trees in the city.

 Roy also expressed his unhappiness with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) for failing to implement the West Bengal Trees (Protection and Conservation in Non-Forest Areas) Act, 2006. 

 I have reports that advertisement agencies are flouting the law and felling trees to put up their billboards. I will take stringent action against them, said the minister.

 Over 80, 000 saplings were planted across the city in 2006. This year, over a lakh saplings will be planted between July 14 and July 20, said the minister. But if some people continue to fell trees, our endeavour to make Calcutta green will fail, he added.

 I will also write to the mayor and request him to see that the Act is enforced. Though it came into force in 2006, nobody bothers to implement it properly, said Roy.

 According to the Act, a person found guilty of felling trees will have to serve a prison term extending up to a year or a fine up to Rs 5,000, or both. 

 However, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya rejected the veiled criticism aimed at the civic body. We always take stern action against persons or agencies involved in felling trees. In at least five cases, we have even lodged FIRs against the offenders, said Bhattacharyya.

 We have a prevention team on the move and citizens can inform our control room if they spot anyone felling trees, said an official from the parks and gardens wing of the CMC. Two persons were arrested on Saturday night from Lake Town for felling 50 neem trees across VIP Road.

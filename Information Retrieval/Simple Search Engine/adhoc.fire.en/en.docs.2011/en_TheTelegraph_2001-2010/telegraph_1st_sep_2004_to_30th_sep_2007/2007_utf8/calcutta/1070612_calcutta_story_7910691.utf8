 Suicide after husband death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mou Chakraborty and Subhasis Pandey 

 A 23-year-old leukaemia patient hanged herself in her Rahara residence on Monday, two days after the death of her husband in a road mishap.

 Mou Chakraborty, who lived with her parents, and Subhasis Pandey had a registered their marriage last year. Their social marriage was to be held this month-end. 

 Subhasis was killed after a truck crushed his motorcycle on Kalyani-Barrackpore Expressway on Saturday. The death devastated Mou. She may have been afraid that no one would take care of her after the death of her husband, said a relative close to her. 

 Mou, the daughter of a government employee, had been quite happy since she returned to the city from Mumbai in September 2005 after undergoing treatment for leukaemia. Doctors had told her that she would have to continue taking medicines but would be able to lead an otherwise normal life.

 The disease had been diagnosed earlier that year. Mou and Subhasis, who owns a dairy in Kalyani, had fallen in love a year before that.

 Mou had fainted after hearing of Subhasiss death on the way to his Barrackpore home from the dairy. For the past two days, she was in a trauma. She kept looking at the saris bought for their marriage, said Amala Das, a neighbour of the Chakrabortys. We never thought that she would take such a step, she added.

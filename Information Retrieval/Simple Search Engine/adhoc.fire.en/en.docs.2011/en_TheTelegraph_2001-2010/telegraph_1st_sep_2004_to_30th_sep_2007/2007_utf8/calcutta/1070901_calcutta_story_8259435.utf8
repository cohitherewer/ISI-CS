 Creative expressions

 Founding his ideal abode of knowledge at Santiniketan in 1901, Tagore envisioned a place of learning which would combine the best of both the East and the West. Kala Bhavan, its college of arts and crafts, gave the liberal arts a new meaning and dimension, where renowned masters like Abanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose and Ramkinkar Baij gave the finest expression to their extraordinary creative genius. Santiniketain continues to sketch eminent personages of the art world even today, of the stature of Jogen Chowdhury, A. Ramachandran and Ramananda Bandyopadhyay. Young Expression, the ongoing group show featuring works by young artists of Santiniketan, best endorses the prosperity of the seeds of creativity sown by Tagore over a century ago. Participants: Bhaskar Goswami, Ramu Das, Deepak Rajbhar, Tathagata Mukherjee, Swapna Biswas (a painting by her appears right), Mirnmoy Debburman, Bilassendu Sil, Mahmud Hussain and Anirban Mitra.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by young artists of Santiniketan When: Till September 5 (except Sunday); 3 pm - 7 pm Where: Kanvas Art Gallery, 53 Syed Amir Ali Avenue, 2nd floor

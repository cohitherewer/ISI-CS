 10 chest clinics for swift care

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Coming up, 10 chest clinics with facilities for immediate treatment and a 24x7 helpline.

 The first of the clinics, planned by Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, was inaugurated in Gariahat on Wednesday.

 Anyone suffering from a chest pain can walk in at any of the clinics even in the middle of night. We will provide immediate medical attention to the patient, said Anil Maini, president (corporate development), Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.

 A person in distress can also dial a toll-free number 1066 and an ambulance will rush him to the nearest clinic free of cost.

 Arijit Bose, chief of the hospitals emergency medical services, said: If the pain is due to an impending cardiac attack, the person will be treated on an emergency basis. If not, the person will be kept under observation for six hours.

 If the pain is not indicative of a cardiac attack, the patient will have to pay only the doctors fee and for diagnostic tests, which will not exceed Rs 2,000, added Bose.

 Land dispute angle to realty killing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two days after the daylight killing of Biju Roy, an employee of a construction firm in Lake Town, police said on Wednesday that the murder could have been the fallout of property-related disputes. 

 Biju Roy, 25, an employee of Somani Realtor in charge of booking flats, was shot dead from point-blank range by two youths on Monday afternoon. The assailants are still at large.

 We are verifying a number of points about Roys background and his work, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 After visiting the victims Champahati residence in South 24-Parganas, police said Roy was involved in some property disputes with family members.

 Property dispute might be the cause. Initially, we thought dubious deals with local goons had led to the murder. But circumstantial evidence does not support it, an officer at Lake Town thana said. 

 Had the assassins extorted the money from the firm, the obvious target would have been the promoter. Biju was just a booking officer; meeting the extortionists demands was beyond his means, he added.

 Investigation also revealed that Biju, who had been working with the firm for the past one-and-a-half years, had taken a loan from moneylenders in Lake Town. We are trying to trace the moneylenders. We have alerted all the police stations, an officer said.

 On Monday, Roy was in his office, near a building under construction, in lake Towns Dakshindari when two youths arrived in a taxi around 3.20 pm.

 According to a witness, the three spoke for a few minutes. After which, one of them started shouting at Biju. He then whipped out a revolver and fired thrice, shooting Biju in the head and chest. 

 As Biju slumped to the ground, bleeding, his assailants got into the waiting taxi and fled. The assassins knew the area well. Two more youths were waiting on a motorcycle, keeping a watch on Biju and the assasins. They, too, fled after the murder, said an officer on the case.

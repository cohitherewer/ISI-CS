The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Blast accused had cops on his heels

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The prime accused in Fridays Hyderabad blast, Mohammad Andul Sahed, alias Bilal, had brought Hyderabad Police to Calcutta a month ago.

 A police team from Hyderabad had spent a couple of days here in April to grill Sheikh Sameer, a Calcutta-based Lashkar-e-Toiba operative whom we arrested, about Bilal. The team returned empty-handed, as Sameer claimed not to have met anyone by that name, said a CID officer.

 But the suspicion of Hyderabad Police later proved to be true, as Sameer admitted during a narco-analysis test that he had, indeed, met Bilal. He said he had discussed with Bilal the safe points along the Indo-Bangla border for terrorists to sneak in. The two had also discussed the use of various types of explosives, said an officer.

 Sleuths may again question Sameer, now in the custody of Mumbai Police, in connection with the Mecca Masjid blast in Hyderabad.

 Sameer, who hails from Aurangabad but settled in Jorasanko, was arrested with two alleged suicide bombers on April 1 at Petrapole.

 Md Illius and Md Yunus, who were detained on Sunday night for interrogation, were released on Monday. Two more, Anil Jain and Md Shahid, were examined on Monday.

 The Hyderabad police team that grilled the suspects left the city on Monday. A bigger team will arrive on Tuesday.

 About the four suspects, deputy inspector-general of police (operations), CID, Rajeev Kumar said: All of them are in the business of selling handsets and SIM cards. They could not recognise the name and the photograph against which the SIM card recovered from the blast site was issued.

 Sleuths have collected the application form for the SIM card a prepaid connection from the service provider. The photograph is of a man in his mid-30s. He is yet to be identified. The address mentioned in the form was fake, said Kumar.

 The SIM was issued on June 4, 2006, and deactivated 20 days later, after the service provider found the information submitted in the form to be fake.

 The terrorists had used the SIM for other reasons. A handset can be used as a timer even with a defunct SIM, said Kumar.

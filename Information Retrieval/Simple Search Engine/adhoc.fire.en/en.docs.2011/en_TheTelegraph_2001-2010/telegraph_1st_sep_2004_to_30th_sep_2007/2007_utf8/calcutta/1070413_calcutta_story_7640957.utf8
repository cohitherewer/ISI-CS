 Disease link to despair

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Depression triggered off by thalassaemia prompted assistant manager of the airports air traffic control wing Arup Kumar Banga to take his life, according to his colleagues.

 Banga was found dead with wrists slit at his Harish Mukherjee Road residence on Wednesday. His wife was at her parents in Belghoria. 

 Banga was weak because of the congenital disease, but he was mentally strong and used to ride a two-wheeler from Bhowanipore to the airport every day, recounted a colleague.

 Recently, however, he had started suffering from depression and could not work in office, he added.

 His seniors and colleagues helped him with his work. According to them, Bangas behaviour had been odd for the past few days, but they did not expect him to commit suicide.

 Lately, Banga had appeared depressed. He kept to himself most of the time, said another colleague. 

 Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee said: Banga was desperate to ensure his death. He slit his wrists and also tried to hang himself from the ceiling fan with a sari. He died of blood-loss after falling off the chair. He was standing on it to tie the noose around his neck.

 Banga had first tried to slit his left wrist with a kitchen knife, added Chatterjee. As it was not sharp enough, he got hold of a new blade to slash his wrists. 

 When Banga did not come out of the house even in the afternoon and the telephone continued to ring, his neighbours called the police, who found him lying in a pool of blood. 

 The Air Traffic Control Guild (eastern region) held a condolence meeting at the airport on Thursday.

 The executive director of Airports Authority of India, S.P.S. Bakshi, said: Assistance will be extended to his family as soon as possible.

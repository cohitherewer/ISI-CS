 Cops take to cricket pitch

 - Counterparts to clash

 KINSUK BASU

 Top cop Prasun Mukherjee should not be upset over the sad fate of Thursdays ODI at Eden Gardens.

 For, he will soon get another opportunity to prove his cricketing acumen on the same ground, not as an organiser but as a captain.

 Come Sunday, Eden Gardens will host a 25-over match between Calcutta Police and its state counterpart.

 While Mukherjee, who skippers the Cricket Association of Bengal, will lead the city team, director-general of police A.B. Vohra will don the captains cap for the Bengal squad.

 The players on either side include officers of the ranks of additional director-general, inspector-general, deputy commissioner and superintendent of police.

 We often play cricket among ourselves, but this is the first time the match is being held in an organised way. It will be great fun, says Zulfikar Hassan, joint commissioner of Calcutta Police.

 Insiders said the players for Calcutta Police are practising for more than two hours every morning at the Alipore Bodyguard Lines. Those likely to bowl are deputy commissioner Jawed Shamim and joint commissioner Sudhir Misra.

 In the Bengal squad, special inspector-general Soumen Mitra is likely to keep. 

 We hope the weather god will not let us down this time, said a senior officer at Writers Buildings.

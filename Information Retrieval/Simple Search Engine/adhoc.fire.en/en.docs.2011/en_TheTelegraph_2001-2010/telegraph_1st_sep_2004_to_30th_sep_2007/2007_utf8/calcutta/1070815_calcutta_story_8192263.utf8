 Fresher haunted by assault memories

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Suman Das, the first-year student who was allegedly ragged at Saroj Mohan Institute of Technology, Guptipara, last Thursday, is still in a trauma.

 He is recovering physically but is still haunted by the memories of that day. He needs psychiatric help to overcome the trauma, said father Shankar Ranjan Das, who too was allegedly beaten up by the students when he tried to save his son.

 Suman was admitted to MR Bangur

 Hospital. Das lodged an FIR with Balagarh police station

 in Hooghly through Jadavpur police station on Friday.

 He, however, did not name any student.

 The college, too, lodged an FIR with Balagarh police station without naming any student and has formed a committee to probe the complaint. We have formed a five-member committee which will submit its report within seven days, said the director of the college, N.K. Singh.

 The superintendent of police (Hooghly), Rajiv Mishra, said: We are conducting an inquiry and the victims, students and college authorities will be interrogated.

 Suman has been admitted to Asutosh College. Debabrata Chowdhury, the principal of the college, said: I am trying to get Suman into one of the engineering colleges run by Techno India in and around the city so that he can study mechanical engineering.

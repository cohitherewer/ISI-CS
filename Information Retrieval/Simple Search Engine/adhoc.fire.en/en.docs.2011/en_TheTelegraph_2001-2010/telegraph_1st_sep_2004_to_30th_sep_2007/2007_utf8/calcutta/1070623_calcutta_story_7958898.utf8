 Slices of Italian life

 The Consulate General of Italy in Calcutta, in collaboration with Federation of Film Societies of India, hosts the screening of a package of Italian films (with English subtitles). Freshwater Man (dir: Antonio Albanese; today at 4 pm) is about the comical campaign of a man who tries to win back his wife, having wandered away after losing his memory in a freak accident. Set against the background of violence kindled by social and racial tensions, The Munchies (dir: Antonio Bocola amp; Paolo Vari; today at 6.30 pm) portrays two friends facing up to their feelings for a girl who suddenly appears in their lives. One Hundred Steps (dir: Marco Tullio Giordana; tomorrow at 4 pm; a scene from the film appears right) is the true story of a boy from the south of Italy, who daringly struggles against the complex set of honour relationships in the sick, corrupt environment of Sicily in the 1970s. We Want the Colonels (dir: Mario Monicelli; tomorrow at 6.30 pm) offers an insight into Italian politics with the satirical account of an attempt of a coup dtat by some fascist officers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Wanted: Eligible brooms 

 Caleidoscope

 SWEEPING STATEMENT: A college student during a clean-up drive

 What goes into keeping Calcutta clean? About 400 tonnes of brooms every year, which cost Rs 50 lakh. Despite the mechanical sweeper, its the classic broom thats made out of the spines of coconut fronds. 

 What else? About 9,000 sweepers, who are supposed to clean 45 lakh square metres of the city roads daily, says controller of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) stores Rehan Sanyal. Each of the 141 wards in the city on an average uses up 400 kg of broom every month.

 There are strict specifications for a CMC broom: each should be 75 (plus/minus 5) cm long. Recently a supply of several tonnes from Contai were rejected since the length of the spines was less than 70 cm. The civic authorities feel Deganga and Badu of North 24 Paraganas, Amtala of South 24 Paraganas and Chaitnyapur of Midnapore are more reliable. 

 Yet Calcutta roads can compete for the worlds dirtiest. Maybe we need better quality brooms. 

 If plants could speak

 AIR OR EXHAUST? Dalhousie Square. A Telegraph picture 

 A MAD magazine cartoon had shown potted plants wilting as a man woke up from sleep and yawned so foul was his stale breath. 

 How do the plants around Dalhousie Square feel? The area is one of the most polluted in the city. 

 During office hours the pall of exhaust fumes becomes so thick that from Red Road, St Andrews church is barely visible of afternoons. Not that we were around, but we are told that only 150 years ago, the environs of Laldighi used to be so calm that people used to go there for walks. An entry in Recollections of Calcutta for over Half a Century by Montague Massey by Thacker, Spink amp; Co, 1918, on Writers Buildings, goes: I lived there myself for some months and very pleasant my quarters I found them. I recollect in the early morning quite a number of small green poroquets used to fly all about the place Now, of course the poroquets wont come at all, not even if they are called parakeets. With work on the underground parking lot soon to begin, one trembles to imagine the amount of dust that will mingle with the exhaust fumes. 

 Spell-bound

 What is your name? A Bengali spread. 

A Telegraph picture

 Noticed how the Bengali menu has changed? 

 We are all familiar with the Fish Butter Fry, which had started life some time as Batter Fry. Fish Muniya, derived from Fish Meuniere, a slice of fish lightly dusted in butter and fried, also doesnt create a flutter. But recently a wedding menu thrust a Capsicum Stupid at a stunned wedding guest. Only after much contemplation did she realise that she was being requested to taste some Stuffed Capsicum. 

 Even more shocking was the experience of three nuns from a missionary school, attending the wedding of one of their students. After the pleasantries were over they were directed to the dining hall and as they sat down for dinner where the menu cards were handed to them. On reading it, they were bewildered. Sisters, I believe we are on the menu! exclaimed one. Naan had been spelt in a novel way.

 Lap-aroscopy 

 One lesson most Calcutta women and young girls who use the citys public transport learn is that there is no escape from what is commonly known as eve-teasing. From lecherous looks to muttered comments to roaming hands, there is no telling what a poor woman might have to endure in a crowded bus or Metro.

 But certain strategies work. A young attractive woman travelling in an autorickshaw had a fellow passenger trying to edge too close to her. The woman tried to shift to her right. The man shifted to the right, too. Kole boshben? (Want to sit on my lap?) the woman asked, furious. It made the auto-driver snicker. The passenger did not quite take up the offer.

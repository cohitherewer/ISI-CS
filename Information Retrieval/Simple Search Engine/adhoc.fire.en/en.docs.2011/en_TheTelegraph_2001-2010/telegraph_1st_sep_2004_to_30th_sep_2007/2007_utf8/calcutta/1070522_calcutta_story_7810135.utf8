 A fun ride after dinner left a bitter taste in the mouth of five students and a businessman, who were hauled to Shakespeare Sarani police station late on Sunday.

 Their crime: stopping their motorcycles in front of the American Center as one of them received a call on his cellphone. The sight of the six, on three motorcycles, was enough for the cops manning the high-security address to suspect them to be terrorists.

 Fearing an attack the memories of the January 2002 strike at the site and the recent Hyderabad blasts fresh in their minds the guards called a police patrol team that rushed to the spot. 

 A group of terrorists planning to attack American Center had been intercepted, the Lalbazar control room was alerted.

 Such was the panic in the force that all senior officers, including police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, were alerted.

 It took a whole nights grilling for the police to realise that the six were anything but terrorists. They were released on Monday morning. 

 An officer said two of them are studying MBA and three are preparing for CA.

 Upendra Mishra, a second-year MBA student, said that he and his friends were on their way back home in Howrah after dinner at McDonalds, on Park Street. They were in front of the American Center around 10.15pm when Sandip Arora, also doing his MBA, got a call on his cellphone.

 Sandip stopped his bike and took the call. We, too, stopped. Suddenly, a police team rushed to the spot and we were taken to Shakespeare Sarani police station. We told the officers that we were students, but they would not listen to us, Upendra added.

 Deputy commissioner (south) Ajoy Kumar said: They were talking over cellphones in front of the American Center. It was very suspicious. As a precautionary measure, they were all examined.

 An officer of the police station added: We thought they had planted bombs nearby and were talking on the phone to trigger a blast, just as what happened in Hyderabad.

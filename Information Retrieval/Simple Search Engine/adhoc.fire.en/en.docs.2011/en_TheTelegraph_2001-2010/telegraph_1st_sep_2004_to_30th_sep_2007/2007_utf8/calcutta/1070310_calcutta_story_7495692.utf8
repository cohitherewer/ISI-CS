The princess of Thailand dropped in at two city colleges on Friday to meet Thai students studying there.

 This is Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorns third visit to Calcutta, according to the Royal Thai consulate. She is popularly known as princess of information technology in Thailand.

 She came to meet two Thai students here, said an official of the consulate. The two students Urai Yangcheepsujarit and Pakorn Wichitiyungyong are supported by Her Royal Highness Scholarship.

 Urai, a first-year student of communicative English at Loreto College, said: We are getting full scholarship for studying here. Pakorn is a first-year BA general course student at St Xaviers College. 

 The princess, who flew into New Delhi on March 5, spent about 45 minutes at each college. A cultural programme was organised at Loreto on the occasion. At St Xaviers, there was a felicitation, followed by an interaction between the princess and students.

 The princess also visited the archaeological museum at Behala tram depot. She was accompanied by the Thai ambassador and the consul-general.

 AbhiAsh: It rocks, sucks

 - Hype, say experts

 Whats the latest trend at the nightclubs? To walk up to the DJ and request an AbhiAsh number.

 The songs picturised on the stars are enjoying a rerun of popularity among the party crowd after their marriage. Kajra re and Barso re megha have now become nightclub staple.

 Its interesting how people have taken to the songs picturised on Abhishek and Aishwarya. So many couples, engaged or newly married, walk up to me and ask for songs picturised on the two, says DJ Akash.

 The term AbhiAsh, coined during the build-up to the wedding of the century on April 22, has also captured the imagination of the party-goers.

 Experts, however, dismiss the use of the term and the popularity of the songs featuring the couple as a fad. People who frequently refer to the two as AbhiAsh or dance to their songs might not be big fans of the stars. The group is drawn in by the hype. Once the euphoria over the marriage fades, the party crowd will try to latch on to another trend, says neuropsychiatrist Sabyasachi Mitra.

 The marriage, widely covered by the media, has left a bad taste in the mouth of many. Even the ardent fans want a break.

 I just do not feel like talking about Abhishek and Aishwarya or watching them, says a fan of the former Miss World. The marriage circus made Abhishek look like a complete loser. He is basking in the glory of Aishwarya and his father Amitabh.

 Mitra explains: Many think that Abhishek and Aishwarya neither complement nor supplement each other. They have enjoyed success as separate brands but their fans might find it difficult to accept them as a single brand.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Entry point for German biz mission

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Superior intellectual resources, low wages, harnessed civic efforts to decongest city core areas and, of course, a forward-looking administration combine to make Calcutta a great city to do business in, according to members of a German biz team in town.

 The 23-member cross-sector delegation is the first from Germany to use the city as its entry point to India on a reconnoitre trip, a fact that makes us proud, Gnter Wehrmann, German consul-general in Calcutta, observed at an orientation conclave on Monday. The meet was hosted by Indo-German Chamber of Commerce, Calcutta.

 The buoyancy was echoed by Wilhelm Werhahn, head of the German delegation. Calcutta is the fastest-changing city in India and provides ample opportunity across various sectors. Besides, Bangalore is totally congested, like some other Indian metros, and many German firms now have Bengal on their radar. 

 State industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen welcomed the delegation and promised all necessary help for ties to fructify. We are aiming to bring investment to Bengal, raise the quality of life, create more jobs and better infrastructure, and we are doing all this because people want change and development, Sen observed.

 Werhahn, also president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Central Rhine Region, was representing a conglomerate group of banking, aggregate, slate, leasing services and other interests. 

 He hoped India would soon be the market leader in the service-driven business and Bengal would play a key role.

 The team comprised a mixed bag, with profiles ranging from transport services to neckties and scarves, packaging to investment banking, translation services to a publisher of telephone directories, textiles to management studies.

 Its great to see so many German business teams touching down on Calcutta. Once they are here, they often realise reality is much better than perception. The image correction is being hastened by big names like Metro and Lufthansa setting up shop, said Bernhard Steinruecke, director-general of Indo-German Chamber of Commerce.

 Steinruecke, who made a presentation on Indias core strengths and the business opportunities existing here, felt once the Tata small car plant in Singur was up and running, it would surely enthuse other automobile makers.

 The team went to see the campus of the Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (IISWBM), while factory visits and sightseeing tours are scheduled for Tuesday.

 Meanwhile, German recce missions will continue, with four more delegations expected in the first quarter itself. In March, we will host a team from Saarland, besides two from North-Rhine Westphalia, one on IT and ITES and the other on steel and metal industries, said B.G. Roy, regional director, Indo-German Chamber of Commerce. 

 Another team from Berlin is due in April.

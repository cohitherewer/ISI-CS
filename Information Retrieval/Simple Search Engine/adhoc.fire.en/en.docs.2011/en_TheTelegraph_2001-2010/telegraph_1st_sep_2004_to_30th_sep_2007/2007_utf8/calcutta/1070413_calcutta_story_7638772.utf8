 Chronicle of immortal lives

 Max Mueller Bhavan, Calcutta hosts Docu-Forum, the screening of two documentary films by Navina Sundaram, a television journalist and independent filmmaker who lives and works in Germany. Portrait of a Patriot: Search for a Rebel (a still from the film appears right), a film on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, traces his adventurous journey on his escape from India, concentrating on the period between 1941 and 1943, when the Indian freedom-fighter operated from Britain. Boses political work and activities in Nazi Germany are reflected upon by key witnesses of that period like A.C. Nambiar, Balakrishna Sarma and Alexander Werth. Also including reminiscences by Boses wife Emilie Schenkl, it is a fascinating document of its time that retains its freshness to this day. Amrita Sher-Gil, A Family Album, offers a personal account of the life and work of the filmmakers legendary aunt. Using old photographs, letters, diary entries and newspaper cuttings, as well as nuggets from stories her mother told her, Sundaram investigates the art and life of Amrita Sher-Gil both as a journalist and a family member.

 Event: Screening of two documentary films by Navina Sundaram When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Max Mueller Bhavan auditorium

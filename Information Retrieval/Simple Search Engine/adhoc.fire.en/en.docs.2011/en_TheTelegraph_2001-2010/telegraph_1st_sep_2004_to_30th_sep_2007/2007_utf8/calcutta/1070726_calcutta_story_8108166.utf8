 Green drive on campus

 A clean

 place breeds a clean mind, believe

 the students of St Xaviers College

 and they would do anything to keep

 their campus and the neighbourhood

 clean. 

 The department of social work, a part of National Social Scheme (NSS), launched their Campus Cleanliness Drive on July 16 to spread awareness about the importance of a clean campus. This is the second year that NSS is organising this week-long event, said Aishik Barua, a second year student of St Xaviers College who is not a member of the department but volunteers to work. There are about 600 members in the colleges social work department. 

 The project kickstarted with the distribution of roughly 700 feel-good written comments. Part of the message was a plea that receivers dispose them in bins if they read them. 

 Students from different departments took up the safaigiri, cleaning different parts of the college premises according to a planned schedule with time slots for each department. NSS members placed a number of plastic bins at various litter-prone zones of the college. 

The annual drive was made more appealing through a colourful street play on July 19. More than 40 students participated in the play. We have been working on this project for quite a while now. Almost everyone was worked for the event, said Aditi Agarwal, a second year BBA student. She is also a member of the editorial team of the annual magazine of NSS, Kadam. 

 The six-day Campus Cleanliness Drive is an annual event organised at the beginning of each academic year. It is aimed at freshers who are involved in large numbers. Even professors from all three sections (morning, day and evening) of the college are roped in. This year we had many freshers and they seemed to be having fun while working to maintain the hygiene standards of the college, said Aishik. 

 The project ended with an exhibition (picture

 college hall on July 21, which

 showcased posters and slogans made

 by the students on the event of

 the project. The project definitely does not end here. Its a long term operation and this week-long drive adds impetus to the original year-long project, said Aditi.

 Inspiration

 I saw

 A

 crystal clear stream,

 Elegant

 but fast,

 That

 no one could tame.

 I

 saw my reflection in the water.

 She

 was the stream,

 I

 saw purity

 Inside

 me, through her. 

 Through

 her eyes,

 Large and deep.

 Her smile

 brings happiness to the world.

 I

 do not believe in

 life

 after death,

 But

 if this life 

 fails

 to be her foil,

 Maybe

 life will

 Unfold

 times of immortality.

 I have faith...

 Lost in

 neons, time meanders.

 The

 lines change. 

 We

 swap places and 

 Sway

 in the wind.

 From

 gloriously publicised signboards

 and prohibited Stick-no-bills

 zones, 

 We

 as banners, posters, bills

 look

 back on the city, 

 The

 roads, the passing vehicles,

 And empty hearts with hollow

 desires. 

 Money,

 love and cosmetics 

 Inhabit

 side by side here.

 The

 world has become unfaithful. 

 But

 its easy to be trusted here: 

 The

 cover must be fantastic. 

 Then,

 a little media hype. 

 In

 this market, brand you,

 And brand me sell alike.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ride with a burly rogue

 I have always protested whenever any of my outstation friends complained of Calcutta becoming an increasingly unsafe place.

 I believed that tales of eveteasing and misbehaviour in Calcutta were isolated incidents and that Calcuttans would surely protest if they saw such a thing happening. 

 But on Sunday, an autorickshaw driver made me change my views on the city and its residents.

 I boarded an autorickshaw (WB04 B8593) on the Behala-Rashbehari route near the New Alipore branch of the State Bank of India around 2.30pm. The back seat was full, so I sat beside the driver, who was smoking. I suffer from allergic asthma and avoid places where people smoke.

 I requested the driver a burly man to stub out his cigarette, referring to the ban on smoking in public places, including public transport.

 He not only refused to do so, but started blowing the smoke directly on my face in defiance. Sarkar ki ainer chhappa lagiye diyechhe dewale je apni janen? (How did you come to know about the ban? Has the government pasted the law on city walls?), he yelled at me.

 Pointing a finger at me, he shouted out that it was because of women like me that there were problems.

 All through this ordeal, he was driving only with his left hand, the right hand holding the cigarette. And after my protest, he kept brushing his left hand against my side. 

 When I asked him to stop, he started abusing me again: If you are wearing such clothes, you have to be prepared for a little bit of this. (I was wearing a long cotton top and a denim capri.) 

 None of the passengers on the rear seat two men and a young woman dared to protest.

 I couldnt take the insult anymore and asked the driver to stop the auto so I could get off.

 I was immediately dumped and the auto sped off. Luckily, a taxi was standing nearby.

 I got into the taxi and asked the driver to follow the auto. As it stopped at Durgapur Bridge to pick up passengers, I took down the number. I also lodged a complaint with New Alipore Police Station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Combo cure for car crawl

 OUR BUREAU 

 A consortium of Malaysian firms, led by Jurutera Perunding Gea, rolled out a Rs 4,200-crore elevated ring road plan before a clutch of ministers at Writers Buildings on Tuesday. The project promises faster transit on a 42-km ring road, circling the city. 

 They have proposed a four-lane mass rapid transportation system with 14 entry and exit points The investors plan to realise their money by collecting a toll, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said after the meeting.

 With the state government

 weighing various options to counter the car crawl

 on roads, it has been offered a slew of proposals. 

 Though the government has not decided which project to take up first, experts in the field of mass transit systems stress the need for proper planning to avoid the errors made while laying the Metro and Circular railway networks.

 The problem with the Metro Railway is that it operates only in one part of the city, which is not the case anywhere else in the world. The problem with the Circular Railway is that it is yet to become circular and commuters are not sure about the frequency of trains, said B.K. Sadhu, chief engineer, traffic transportation department. 

 The proposals lying with the government will require huge investments and also involve a lot of complex issues, like land acquisition. 

 So, a concerted approach to planning the projects is a must, said a professor in urban planning with a leading B-school. I think both the East-West Metro corridor and the Light Rail Transit are necessary in Calcutta, not as two independent means of transport but as complementary systems, he added. 

 According to him, complementarity among various modes of transport is a must to meet the target of decongestion. 

 During the planning stages, the Circular Railway was thought of as an elliptical line, with the Metro Railway as the central axis and the intention was to develop a synergistic relationship. But the Metro Rail capacity has not been fully utilised. So, before taking up big-ticket investments, bus, tram and auto routes should be altered to get more passengers to the underground railway, added the expert. 

 The feasibility studies, which the investors are conducting, may throw up some more light on what adjustments can be made in the existing set-up for a smoother ride on city roads. 

 Almost 60,000 new cars hit the road every year and with various forms of encroachments, the road space has shrunk from five per cent to four per cent in the past few years. We have to find alternative options and the planning should include both the city and the fringes for the desired results, summed up Sadhu.

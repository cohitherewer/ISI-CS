 A gold hallmarking unit in Burrabazar is allegedly being run in violation of an order issued by the state pollution control board.

 Local residents alleged that GN Hallmarking Refinery Private Limited, at 6 Adi Banstala Lane (ward 23), emits toxic fumes, stores nitric acid beyond the permissible limit and uses a generator without installing a silencer.

 The owners of the unit, however, denied the charges.

 The pollution watchdog had organised a public hearing on April 27 following complaints from the residents against the unit.

 The order asked the unit to cut down on its use of nitric acid, responsible for the toxic fumes. The unit was also asked not to store more than a litre of nitric acid at a time the limit set by the board in its no-objection certificate.

 The unit was found to have installed a 15-KVA diesel generator on the third floor without the boards permission. The order issued by Dipak Chakraborty, head of the boards technical cell stated that the generator, if fitted with a silencer, could be installed on the ground floor. 

 The unit has hardly taken any step to carry out the order. It is still running the generator, without a silencer, on the third floor. The sound is deafening, said Pappu Saraf, a local resident.

 The residents also alleged that the unit had not cut down on the use of nitric acid and that it still stores the acid much beyond the limit.

 Denying the charges, the owners claimed they have installed a scrubber to check nitric acid fumes. But the scrubber reportedly failed to operate during an inspection by the pollution control board.

 We are abiding by the order. We are not using the generator and have stopped stocking nitric acid in excess of the limit, said Uday Shinde, who is on the board of directors of the unit.

 The pollution control board will seek police help in enforcing the order if the residents lodge a complaint regarding the violation, said Chakraborty.

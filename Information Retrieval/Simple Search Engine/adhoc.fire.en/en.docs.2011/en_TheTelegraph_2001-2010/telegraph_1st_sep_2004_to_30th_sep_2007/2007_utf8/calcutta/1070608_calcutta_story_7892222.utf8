 20-year-old woman throttled for dowry

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Nasima Bibi: Tale of torture and death 

A man who wanted a motorcycle for his dowry strangled his 20-year-old wife on Wednesday night. 

 Cops are on the hunt for Sheikh Nazibul, 24, who fled after neighbours entered their house and discovered the body of Nasima Bibi, bearing marks of torture and strangulation.

 Nazibuls younger brother and his parents have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the murder, said S.N. Gupta, district superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas).

 Two years ago, Nasima had married Nazibul, a tailoring business proprietor of Raipur, Mahestala, on the southern fringes of the city.

 Ever since their marriage, Nazibul and his parents tortured my daughter for money, said Sakina Bibi, Nasimas mother. 

 Nasimas father, who also runs a tailoring business, used to pay but he couldnt keep up with Nazibuls demands, said Nurul Amin Sheikh, husband of Nasimas sister.

 The latest demand was money for buying a motorcycle, said Nasimas mother. She had run away to us with her year-old child. But we sent her back to her husband after counselling, said Sakina, weeping bitterly.

 Neighbours said that they had heard the couple quarrelling late on Wednesday. We decided to interfere when we heard a groan coming from the house, said Saukat Ali Mollah, next-door neighbour of Nazibul.

 The neighbours found Nasima on the floor with a bloated throat and took her to a local hospital, where the doctors declared her dead. 

 We have sent the body for post-mortem and hope to arrest Nazibul soon, said the district police chief.

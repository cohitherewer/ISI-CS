 Hospitals bicker, patient suffers

 - NO AID FOR WOMAN WITH CIRRHOSIS

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 40-year-old woman suffering from cirrhosis of liver has been left untreated at a government hospital for almost a week, because of the inadequacy of the state healthcare system and administrative protocol.

 Kusuma Maity, a resident of Nabin Mukherjee Lane, in Howrah, has been suffering from severe stomach pain and other abdominal problems for a month. Last Tuesday, she was admitted to Howrah State General Hospital and diagnosed with cirrhosis of liver.

 A large amount of fluid was aspirated from her enlarged abdomen. The doctors there told us to shift her to Calcutta as the hospital does not have the required treatment facilities, said Prashanta Chakraborty, a relative of Kusuma.

 Husband Joydeb, who works in a private firm, brought her to Medical College and Hospital the same day. We took her to the hospital in the morning but she was left unattended to in the emergency ward till the afternoon, Joydeb alleged.

 Finally, the hospital authorities said Kusuma could not be admitted as there was no bed. We took her back home but her condition worsened at night and she had to be rushed to SSKM Hospital, recalled Chakraborty. But there was no bed at SSKM, too. We were advised to get her admitted to any other hospital, he added.

 The family then took Kusuma to nearby Sambhunath Pandit Hospital, where doctors claimed they had no facilities for treating liver cirrhosis. Kusuma was admitted but the doctors are administering only painkiller injections to her twice a day. They told us that staying in the hospital was like staying in a hotel. There will be no real treatment, Chakraborty said.

 The family members approached SSKM Hospital on Saturday, but were asked to bring a declaration from the Sambhunath Pandit authorities that the hospital did not have the treatment facilities.

 But the Sambhunath Pandit authorities would not issue such a letter. Rather, they threatened to discharge her in that condition, said the relative.

 A Sambhunath Pandit official said: We will speak to SSKM and try to get her transferred there.

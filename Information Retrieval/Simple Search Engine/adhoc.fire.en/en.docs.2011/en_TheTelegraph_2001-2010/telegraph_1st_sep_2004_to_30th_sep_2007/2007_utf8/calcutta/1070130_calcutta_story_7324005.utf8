A legend, minus Lata

 He will always be remembered as much for his hit parade as his ability to make it to the top of the Bollywood music chart without Lata Mangeshkar. After all, in 1952, when you are doing your first film score for a certain Dalsukh Pancholis Aasman and you resolve never to work with the Nightingale of India because she didnt turn up to sing a lori, you better know what youre doing. Omkar Prasad Nayyar sure did.

 Making the most of Shamshad Begum, Geeta Dutt, Mohammed Rafi and Asha Bhonsle (his muse for years), the man from Lahore wove a musical tapestry that had a sound so distinctive, a rhythm so delightful.

 We pick our five favourite OP Nayyar scores.

 CID (1956): The best thing about OP Nayyar was he wouldnt have one stray chartbuster here and there. His soundtracks would be replete with one gem after the other. In this Raj Khosla film there was Ye hai Bombay meri jaan (Geeta Dutt, Mohammed Rafi), Aankhon hi aankhon mein (Geeta, Rafi), Kahin pe nigahen kahin pe nishana (Shamshad Begum), Jaata kahaan hai deewane (Geeta) and Leke pehla pehla pyaar (Shamshad, Geeta, Rafi). 

 Naya Daur (1957): In this B.R. Chopra classic, Nayyar produced a brilliant mix of robust chorus and soft silken duets. So, while on the one hand there was Reshmi salwar kurta jaalidar (Asha, Shamshad) and Yeh desh hai veer jaawanon ka (Rafi, Balbir), there were also ballads like Maang ke saath tumhara (Rafi, Asha), Udein jab jab zulfein teri (Rafi, Asha) and Saathi haath badhana (Rafi, Asha).

 Howrah Bridge (1958): The Shakti Samanta film will always find mention in Indian film history for Helens dance to Mera naam chin chin choo (Geeta). The film had another Nayyar classic in Aaiye meherbaan (Asha).

 Kashmir Ki Kali (1964): Perhaps Nayyars most heard, sung and remixed score, this Shakti Samanta film had Ishaaron ishaaron mein dil lenewaale (Rafi, Asha), Tareef karoon kya uski (Rafi), Kisi na kisi se kabhi na kabhi (Rafi) and Deewana hua badal (Rafi, Asha).

 Mere Sanam (1965): This Amar Kumar film had another classic score by Nayyar picturised on Asha Parekh, Mumtaz and Biswajit. Some great songs in the movie were Jayiye aap kahaan jaayenge (Asha), Pukarta chala hoon main (Rafi), Yeh hai reshmi zulfon ka andhera (Asha) and Humdum mere maan bhi jaao (Rafi, Asha).

 Postscript: One OP Nayyar song that stands out beyond these five films and remains one of the most haunting melodies, ever, is Chain se humko kabhi (Asha in Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye).

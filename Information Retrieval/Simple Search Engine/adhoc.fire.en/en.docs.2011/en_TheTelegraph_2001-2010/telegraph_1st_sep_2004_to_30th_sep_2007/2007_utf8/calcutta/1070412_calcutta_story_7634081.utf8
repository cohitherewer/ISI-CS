 Music masterpieces

 Born in Alessandria, Italy in 1976, Alessio Nebiolo began his musical education as a pupil of Giampiero Biello in Asti. He pursued advanced studies with masters such as Stefano Grondona, Guido Margaria, Betho Davezac, Dusan Bogdanovic and Dagoberto Linhares at the Lausanne Conservatory where he was awarded the Diploma of Virtuosity. Since his first appearance at the Palazzo Ottolenghi in Asti, in 1995, he has given solo performances in many concert halls all over Europe. He has also been on tour in Romania with the Orchestra Philermonia Marea Neagra. Presently, he teaches guitar at the Conservatoire de Musique de Gneve in Switzerland. Sponsored by the Government of Italy through the Italian Institute of Culture, New Delhi and the Regione Piedmonte, in collaboration with the Calcutta School of Music, this celebrated classical guitarist is currently touring India. This evening, Nebiolo presents a solo music concert that promises to charm the audience with the dulcet magic of his classical guitar. His music amply illustrates the wealth of sonorit and dynamics than can be gained from his instrument and succeeds in creating a harmonic equilibrium between the impulse of the compositions and the depths of the subconscious mind which it seeks to touch. Featuring Gaspar Sanzs Suite Espaola, Joaquin Rodrigos Invocation et Danse, Nicolo Paganinis Romanza e Andantino Variato, Johann Jakob Frobergers Tombeau, a jazz sonata composed by Dusan Bogdanovic and the sonata op.47 by Alberto Ginastera.

 Event: Classical guitar recital by Alessio Nebiolo When: Today at 7 pm Where: Calcutta School of Music, 6B Sunny Park

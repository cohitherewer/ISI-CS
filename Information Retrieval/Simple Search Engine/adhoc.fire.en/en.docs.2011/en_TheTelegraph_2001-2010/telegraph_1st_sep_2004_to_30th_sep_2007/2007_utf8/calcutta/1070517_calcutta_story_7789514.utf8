The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Make a difference

 My mother

 was the most beautiful woman I ever

 saw. All I am I owe to my mother.

 I attribute all my success in life

 to the moral, intellectual and physical

 education I received from her George

 Washington had said.

 And what would Sarbori Guptas 14 kids at the Salt Lake address of SOS Childrens Villages of India say? They were not born to her but her life revolves around them just like the lives of the 14 other mothers at the village revolve around the children who stay with them. One hundred and fifty-three orphaned children have found a home with the Calcutta chapter of this international organisation.

 In 1987, as a 22-year-old, I was working with Hindustan Lever. But I chucked that job to join here. I guess I could have made it big in life in the conventional sense. But I have never regretted bidding the corporate world adieu. It could never have given me the kind of job satisfaction I derive being a mother without literally being one, Gupta said.

 SOS mothers are not permitted to marry. They can visit their folks on their off days or when they are on leave. But they share such an intimate relationship with their children that many of them end up taking them along. 

 The mothers are assigned the charge of around 10 children and live with them like any other family in three-room apartments. Most households have a television, refrigerator and washing machines. The children attend the neighbourhood schools like any other kid.

 Most mothers have their task cut out bringing up one kid. So how much trouble is caring for 14 children? My kids are very well behaved, said Gupta with motherly pride. The older ones take care of the younger ones. They also help each other with homework. I have to supervise but its no trouble at all. 

 Gupta is especially proud of her 28-year-old daughter Anita Sarkar, who had attended Loreto Convent School. She is all set to join Wipro in Salt Lake as an associate. I want to work with the SOS village in New Delhi in future, Anita told Metro,

 She added: I owe a lot to SOS villages and wish to give something back to the organisation. I will be able to make a greater difference from there. 

 Mothers Day is celebrated on May 10 every year (instead of the second Sunday of May) at SOS villages around the world, is a special occasion for all the mothers there. At this years celebrations, the management bought saris for the 15 mothers, which the children gifted at a function at the NGOs B.K. Block premises. 

 The children also made small gifts on their own. Poornima Balmiki (15), a Class VIII student of Shishu Niketan, made a beautiful table cloth for her mother Nibha De. The mothers also took the kids out to a restaurant to round off the eventful day.

 Whats on your mind this

 week

 That new world

 Man has

 always wondered whether there is

 life beyond earth. So the discovery

 of a new planet brings hope about

 the existence of life there. Even

 through all uncertainty, space explorations

 and missions are still carried out. 

 Gliese 581, the new star that was spotted a few days back, is reported to have a reasonably narrow range of average temperature, from 0 to 40 degree Celsius. Evidence of liquid water has also been reported. Future explorations will help in dispelling doubts about extraterrestrial life and the existence of other life-supportive forms there. 

 With the onset of the 21st century, technological advancements are on the gallop. With the use of highly specialised gadgets, science can find out the answer to otherwise unknown facts in the universe. But can we think of a picture-perfect life on a new planet today? The earth that we live in is scarred with violence, destruction and turmoil. Socio-economic disasters claim the lives of millions. Communal prejudices have become the order of the day. In modern society, psychological disorders are on the rise. The philosophers within us are dying. The rational being in our minds is being swept aside by stringent social turbulence. At this juncture, should we not aspire to a better future? Whether on this land or in a new planet? Obviously, we shall not eye for a Utopian society. 

 To make the new world our ideal destination, let us learn to believe in ourselves and in a well-defined society. 

 We need to realise what it is to live in a wounded world like ours. We would like to have a new world that wouldnt have the pricks of communal living and without the pain that women have felt in this world, without the pangs that the poor undergo and the disgrace of the unfortunate. Let us advance in our minds, in technology, in society and in the spirit of brotherhood in our lives. All this, let us hope, shall be the markers of a new world.

 Hyped marriage

 The Abhi-Ash marriage

 is the most hyped marriage in the history of Indian

 media. It is ridiculous that the media has blown

 up such a trivial affair, as if it were an issue

 of national importance. To add to the mad frenzy

 are the equally hilarious polls that are being

 conducted on the couple. It is high time the media

 realised that such news may capture attention,

 but is in bad taste.

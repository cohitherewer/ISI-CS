 Plot sale for fleet upgrade

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government has decided to sell or lease out a plot on AJC Bose Road to collect funds for the upgrade of the Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) buses and the addition of Bharat Stage (BS) III buses to the fleet. 

 Bids have been invited from private parties for the plot on 83 and 84 AJC Bose Road, which belongs to the CSTC, said a transport department official. A few years back, a private party had offered Rs 30 crore for the plot. We expect a better deal this time, added the official.

 Going by the market rate, the CSTC can mop up about Rs 50 crore by selling the plot. That will allow the corporation a free hand in expanding its fleet. A BS-III bus costs about Rs 17 lakh.

 The project could prove a trend-setter. The state transport department owns prime property at Maniktala, Lake Gardens, Tollygunge, Salt Lake, Shyambazar, Kalighat and other places.

 Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said the plot might be given on long-term lease. We floated the tender on March 31 and received a couple of bids. We then modified the terms and extended the deadline to May 30. The chosen private party can develop a mall or a residential estate on the plot. Apart from upgrading the fleet, we will use the money to improve the condition of the depots, he stated.

 The developer has to provide the CSTC floor space of 4,000 sq ft, a bus bay, an operation room and toilets in the basement, added an official.

 Several estates had been planned by the department over the past five years, but the projects did not take off. Keeping in mind the track report, we decided to sell the land, the official added.

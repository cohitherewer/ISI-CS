The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Thrashed by headmaster 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Prasad Naskar, a Class VIII student, was seriously injured after he was allegedly beaten up by the headmaster for not showing up in the school uniform on Saturday. 

 A complaint has been lodged against Prabhakar Das, the headmaster of Dakshin Durgapur Sreekrishna Chandra High School, in Baruipur.

 Milan Kanti Das, Prasads classteacher, said the boy had come to school in casual clothes as his uniform had not been washed.

 But the headmaster ignored the plea and started beating him up with a stick. Prasad fled, but while trying to inform a classmate about his condition, he hit his head against a bench and injured himself further, he added.

 Prasads friends took him to Sri Ramakrishna Sevashram Hostel in Bishnupur, where he stays. The hostel authorities admitted him to a local hospital as he kept vomiting and fell unconscious.

 He was shifted to National Medical College and Hospital, as his condition deteriorated.

 The hostel authorities lodged a complaint against the headmaster with Baruipur police station.

 The headmaster admitted that he had beaten up the boy, but not in a way that could have caused grievous injuries. He was not wearing the uniform and also turned up late. He kept arguing with me while I was trying to point out his lapses, he said. 

 Police have contacted the boys parents.

 Martial art at home

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Champa, 18, was seven months old when she was abandoned by her parents at Khardah railway station. Police took the crying child to court and then sent her to the Liluah Home for Destitute, which has ever since been her refuge. Now, she is an expert in kickboxing and karate.

 Sharmistha Das (name changed), 15, was raped by her employer in Cooch Behar two years ago. As her stepmother refused to take her back, she was sent to the Liluah home. She, too, is a karate champion.

 Last Sunday was a memorable weekend for Champa, Sharmistha and 10 other inmates of the state-run home. For the first time, they stepped out of the confines of their refuge and were taken to Bhowanipore Byayam Samity, where they were given certificates in karate and kickboxing.

 I had never seen the world outside for the past 18 years. It was such a wonderful experience, said Champa, tears welling up in her eyes. 

 She wants to become a teacher. I want to teach the hapless girls at destitute homes and help them become independent, she said.

 As part of their effort to make inmates all victims of injustice independent, the home authorities decided to teach them karate and kick-boxing a couple of years ago.

 The girls also go to school on the home premises where they are taught Bengali, English, painting and embroidery.

 Now that I have learnt karate, I can protect myself. All girls should learn the martial art for self-defence, said Sharmistha, who landed at the Liluah home two years ago.

 Her stepmother had sent her to a businessmans house in Burrabazar in 2004 to work as a maid. Finding her alone in the house one day, the trader raped her. Her parents shunned her for the stigma.

 I am very happy at the home and do not want to go back to my parents, she said, sobbing.

 The authorities are helpful and we are planning to form a karate team which will participate in competitions, said Sumati Das, a trainer and an employee of the home.

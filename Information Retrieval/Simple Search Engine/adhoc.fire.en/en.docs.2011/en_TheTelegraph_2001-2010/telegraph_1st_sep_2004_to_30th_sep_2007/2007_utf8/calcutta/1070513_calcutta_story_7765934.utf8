 Mountains can fly

 Nature is making an exit from Salt Lake. Snails used to come once to my house. Not any longer. Bees used to build hives once. They still do but the smell of turpentine and noise drives them away. Once we used to find snakes sleeping on the floor. They have disappeared. Nature used to surround us once. Now we are hemmed in by brick and mortar, says Jayashree Chakravarty in her studio on the first floor of her house. 

 This ecological change has perhaps influenced her current body of paintings soon to be exhibited in New York. She has always been innovative, but it is only of late that her worth has gone up several fold in the art market she is in the half-a-crore-canvas league.

 However, the artist does not put too high a price on this. Earlier, on many occasions I could not buy paint. Even now I am not in an overdrive. Only 14 works over a period of one-and-a-half years. Mine is not repetitive work. I always have to pull myself out of the cushion I may have created, says the artist whose hallmark is experimentation.

 Chakravartys work has acquired a simplicity that comes only with maturity. Besides large areas of white soft, gleaming and creamy blue and sepia and grey are the only colours she uses, sparingly. The electroencephalogram, a graphic record of the electrical activity of the brain as recorded by an electroencephalograph, was not so long ago one of the most visible images in her canvases. It is fading out. She gives free rein to her imagination and has bid adieu to the conventions of composition.

 Her canvases seem to grow from all sides, and images crop up all over the place. Drawing has always been her strong suit but now she often prefers to draw like a child. The tiny houses scattered across the length and breadth of her work could be out of a childs drawing book. She tosses them around like playthings.

 Nature in the form of myriad birds and insects has crept into her canvases. I used to see geese in Tripura where I was brought up and also in Santiniketan. I had heard in my childhood that mountains could fly at one time. My mountains too take wing. This is in between fantasy and reality, says Chakravarty.

 Thrushes, sparrows and quails and birds without pedigree invade her paintings as do ants, roaches, beetles and spiders, which become the centre of gravity in one work held together by a giant web.

 Her work has a deeply meditative quality symbolised by the heads deep in thought and the genderless figures reminiscent of unclothed Gandhara Buddhas, although devoid of any religious significance. So much is happening at the same yet a sense of calm prevails.

 I put many things on a platform, layer upon layer. I observe without commenting. All the ingredients are put into a mixie and churned around, she says.

 She buys pumpkin flower (she paints its blue instead of its natural yellow) from her Salt Lake market. In her scheme of things that is as important as a chateau or a church which she has seen in the course of her travels.

 I dont know if I am talking of displacement or not but this is all about my experience and I am mapping that through my work. Internally, I belong to this world and not to India alone, asserts Chakravarty.

 She is being true to herself.

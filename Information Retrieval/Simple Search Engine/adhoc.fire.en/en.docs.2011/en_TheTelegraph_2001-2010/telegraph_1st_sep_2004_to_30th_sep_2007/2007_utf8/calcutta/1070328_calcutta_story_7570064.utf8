 From soft drinks to antiseptic cream, aromatic candles to petroleum jelly researchers in the chemical engineering department of Jadavpur University are working overtime to develop products for the market. 

 This is a new trend. More and more companies are approaching us for projects, said Siddhartha Datta, pro vice-chancellor of the university. According to him, even proprietary businesses and small companies are seeking research support from the university. 

 We are specialising in product development from flower extracts. We started about three years ago with a drink made from betel leaf extracts. Guidance, a Howrah-based food and beverages company, bought the technology, said Asim Chatterjee, technical superintendent of the chemical engineering department. The technology changed hands for about Rs 3 crore. 

 We are planning a joint venture with the government, but cant spell out the details now, said Alekhya Roy, director of Guidance. The drink made from betel-leaf extracts will be available before the Puja, he added. 

 The 86-year-old department is trying to utilise flowers wasted at Howrahs Mullickghat due to overproduction. It is a matter of pride that the researchers and students have managed to develop products from what was being wasted, said Dutta. 

 The department is exploring the possibility of marketing an antiseptic cream made of aloe vera extracts. It has also developed a petroleum jelly, which has been distributed to over 600 people for tests. Companies like Emami have expressed interest in the product, but we have not decided what to do with it, stated Chatterjee. 

 Aromatic candles, insect repellents and green chilli paste are some other products the department is developing. We started our research with an academic perspective, but now want to expand its scale with the help of the industry, said Chatterjee.

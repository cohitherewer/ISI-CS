The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Roman holiday amp; beyond

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The smaller islands of Italy offer marvellous spectacles under the surface,too

 What is the fatal charm of Italy? I believe it is a certain permission to be human, which other places, other countries, lost long ago.

 Now, you can be an actor in your own holiday movie with Italy as the backdrop, according to Salvatore Ianniello, Indian representative of ENIT, the Italian State Tourism Board, back in Calcutta to hard-sell Italy as a complete tourist destination after last years Festa Italiana.

 Ianniello, who made a video presentation at the seminar, Italy A Unique Work of Art, organised jointly by ENIT, the Indo-Italian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IICCI), eastern region, and the Italian consulate in Calcutta on Tuesday, felt the city was poised to boost its tourist traffic to Italy.

 We have been supporting Calcutta tour operators with information workshops and also exposing them to the product directly, so that they can formulate customised packages for their clientele. Of course, the lack of a direct flight remains a deterrent, but things are looking up, he smiled.

 The conclave, which addressed over 40 representatives from the local travel trade, included an interactive session on visa procedures and guidelines and also launched an ENIT publication, The Little Book of Italy, penned by Bandana Tewari, offering tips to tour operators on the 20 Italian states.

 The simplification of visa norms has seen a 50 per cent jump in visas issued to Calcuttans. However, while Mumbai and Delhi are now more mature markets looking at rare and exotic destinations, Calcutta is still at the entry level and prefers the Rome-Venice-Florence loop, Italian consul-general in Calcutta Agostino Pinna told Metro.

 The visit of Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi to Calcutta has had a very positive impact among the business community here, stressed Pankaj Parekh, IICCIs eastern region chairman, the ripple effects of which will be felt in tourism too, he felt.

 Ianniello, who thought the profile of the business traveller from India was changing with the young generation more keen to mix pleasure with business hoped the information technology boom would buoy Calcuttas share. We are training tour operators to be specialists in different areas, he added.

 So, the rolling green meadows, craggy mountains and exquisite coastline of Basilicata, the spa resorts of Salsomaggiore or Tabiano, the scenic trails of the Apuane and Orecchiella National Parks in Northern Tuscany are all likely to find their way into Italy packages offered by the city travel trade soon.

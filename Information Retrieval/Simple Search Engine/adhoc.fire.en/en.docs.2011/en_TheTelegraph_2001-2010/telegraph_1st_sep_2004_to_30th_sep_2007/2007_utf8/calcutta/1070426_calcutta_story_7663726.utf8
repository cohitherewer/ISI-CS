 College in autonomy dither trap

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Presidency College is set to miss the autonomy bus. 

 April 30 is the last date for colleges wanting autonomy in the 11th Plan period to submit their applications, but the committee set up by the state government to examine the issue of autonomy for Presidency College is yet to submit its report.

 A college needs permission from the state government and its affiliating university to seek autonomy from the University Grants Commission (UGC).

 If Presidency College fails to submit its application by April 30, it will not become autonomous in the next five years. The UGC set the deadline in a circular sent last month to the universities and the state governments. St Xaviers College was granted autonomy in July last year. 

 The high-powered committee that is trying to determine since last year the ideal status of Presidency College as an autonomous institution or a deemed university is at least a month away from submitting its report.

 The committee is examining all possible ways of improving Presidency College. Autonomy may not emerge as the ideal status, said P.N. Ghosh, a member of the panel and the dean of the engineering faculty of Calcutta University.

 According to him, the panel is trying to submit its report to the government by June.

 Subhankar Sarkar, director of public instruction, said: The government will be in a position to take a decision on the upgrade of Presidency College only after the committee submits its report.

 Emphasising his intention of keeping centres of educational excellence free of politics, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had stated last year that Presidency College would become autonomous by July 2006.

 The deadline was extended and the high-powered committee set up after pressure from the CPM-dominated West Bengal College and University Teachers Association and the Government College Teachers Association. The teachers bodies feared Presidency College would be a precedent for other government colleges, which would press for autonomy and escape political control.

 The teachers had said Presidency should be turned into a university, to which all 17 state-run colleges will be affiliated.

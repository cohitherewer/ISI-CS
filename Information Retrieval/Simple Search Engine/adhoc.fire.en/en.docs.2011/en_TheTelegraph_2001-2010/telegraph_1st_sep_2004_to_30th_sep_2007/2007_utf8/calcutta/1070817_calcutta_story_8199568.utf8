 Trio convicted for murder

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 An Alipore court on Thursday convicted Paresh Mukherjee, Notan Talukdar and Kochi Halder for the death of Biswarup Roy Choudhury on Saptami night in October 2004. 

 Roy Choudhury, the owner of an eatery, Pink Giraffe, on Lake View Road, was assaulted by his landlord Paresh Mukherjee for refusing to vacate the premises. He later succumbed to his injuries.

 This is a case of culpable homicide, where the accused had no intention of murder. The victim died due to the assault, judge Suryendu Biswas said in his verdict. The sentences will be pronounced on Friday.

 After the assault, a case was registered against the landlord and he was arrested along with the two others.

 According to sources, the landlord had repeatedly asked Roy Choudhury to vacate the premises as the three-year contract was over. In retaliation, Roy Choudhury demanded compensation for certain damage caused to his restaurant by Mukherjees negligence.

 Rajarshee, the victims son and also the main witness to the incident, deposed before the trial court. Around 12.30am, Mukherjee entered the restaurant and asked me to leave. When I refused, he caught me by the collar and started beating me up. Soon after, Notan Talukdar and Kochi joined him. One of them kept beating me. I lost my balance and fell on the floor, said Rajarshee.

 His father, Biswarup, sprang up to his defence, but failed. They pushed my mother Ratna aside, holding her by her hair, and then started beating up my father. They continued to shower blows on him till he collapsed, Rajarshee said. His father was rushed to a Tollygunge nursing home, where he was declared dead.

Trader Swapan Mukherjee was found unconscious in a train compartment at Sealdah station. He had been drugged and robbed of his belongings. The government railway police (GRP) officers huddled around the 43-year-old as his pulse rate dropped, unable to provide help in the absence of doctors on the premises.

 Mukherjee was taken to a hospital by the GRP officers, but many passengers are not so lucky. They suffer due to lack of medical aid at the station. A long debate between the GRP and the Eastern Railway on this count has not yielded results. 

 It is important to have a doctor around at Sealdah station, which registers footfalls of over 10 lakh daily. The railway has only arranged for a private ambulance service. Even that is not available after sundown, said senior superintendent of railway police (Sealdah) Barun Mallick.

 We have requested the railway several times to set up a medical assistance booth at the station, but it has not paid heed to our concerns. We do not even have first-aid kit in our office and lack the expertise to deal with an emergency, added Mallick.

 According to another GRP officer, none of the stations in and around the city has medical facilities. There is a first-aid booth at Howrah station with an attending doctor, but it does not stay open for more than seven hours. The best we can do if a passenger suffers a heart attack is take him to hospital.

 Senior public relations officer, Eastern Railway, Samir Goswami argued that there are hospitals close to both Sealdah and Howrah stations and hence, there was no need to have round-the-clock medical assistance on the premises.

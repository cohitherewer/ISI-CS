 The CID on Thursday unearthed a racket in fake stamp papers and arrested three men, including a father-son duo, in Dum Dum and Birati. Fake non-judiciary stamp papers worth Rs 2.76 lakh and 50 pieces of rubber stamps were seized from them.

 Following a tip-off, a team went to Shibtala, in Dum Dum, and arrested Ajit Maity, 70, and his son Robin, in his early-50s. Apart from fake stamp papers and rubber stamps of land revenue officials and the additional district magistrate (land revenue), we seized fake letterheads of various municipalities, said a CID officer. 

 nterrogating the duo, the sleuths came to know of Kamalendhu Dhar, who was arrested at his Birati home. The three used to deliver the fake papers to Barrackpore, Barasat and Salt Lake courts, the officer added. 

 A section of students of SSKM Hospital, led by the AIDSO, boycotted classes and gheraoed the acting director for more than three hours, demanding action against outsiders who had assaulted a few student union members. A police team went to the hospital to bring the situation under control.

 Several employees of Ruby General Hospital organised an agitation on Thursday evening to protest ill-treatment by the management. A protester said the management was misbehaving with the staff and had even slapped a Group D employee. The management, however, denied the charges. The protest continued for two hours. A police picket has been posted at the hospital.

 A 50-year-old mechanic was injured after being hit by a car on Shyamlal Street, in Ultadanga, on Thursday afternoon. Police said Nilu Pal was repairing a vehicle on the road when the mishap occurred. He was admitted to RG Kar Hospital. 

 A fire broke out in a four-storeyed building on Rabindra Sarani around 3.30am on Thursday. Ten tenders brought the blaze under control around noon. No one was injured. The building houses several business outlets.

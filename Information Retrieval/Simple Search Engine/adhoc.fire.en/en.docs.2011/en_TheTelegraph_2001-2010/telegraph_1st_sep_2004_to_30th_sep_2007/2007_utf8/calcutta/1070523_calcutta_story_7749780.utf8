The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Spat clouds CAS launch

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The spat between broadcaster Zee Turner and multi-system operator (MSO) Shrishti may delay the launch of the second phase of the conditional access system (CAS) in Calcutta. The broadcaster has questioned the right of the city representative of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to issue a directive asking it to share signals with the MSO. 

 The nodal officer of Trai, Abhijit Sanyal, had issued a letter to the broadcaster under instructions from the principal secretary in the state information and cultural affairs department, Dilip Chakraborty directing it to provide decoders to the MSO. The decoders will enable Shrishti to beam the Zee bouquet of channels.

 Zee challenged Sanyals authority and served a notice asking him to explain his stand. The letter from the broadcaster may stand in the way of launching CAS II in the city in August. The letter from Zee has been forwarded to Trai by the state government, said an official of the department.

 The nodal officer has asked Trai to explain his role in the CAS roll-out. He has also sought authorisation to resolve disputes. Sanyal said in the letter that if he, a representative of the state government and Trai, is not authorised to resolve issues that affect the consumer, the state government will not be part of the CAS launch in the city, added the official.

 According to industry insiders, the post of Trais nodal officer is ornamental.

 It is true that I had sent a letter to Zee Turner asking it to sort out its differences with Shrishti. I have provided details of the communication to the Trai authorities. I cannot say anything more on the issue before I receive an order from the regulatory body. The order is expected soon, said Sanyal.

 A senior official of Zee Turner said the broadcaster has informed Trai about Sanyals letter and its stand on the issue.

 Calcutta High Court on Monday frowned at the disruption of train services in all three divisions of Sealdah station on Saturday, which left five lakh passengers stranded for more than five hours and resulted in scuffles between the railway police and commuters. 

 On Monday, the high court set up an administrative panel to probe the disruptions that snowballed from altercations between the driver of a local train and the Sealdah railway magistrate, Mintu Mallick. 

 Soon after the incident, a subordinate court judge apprised Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar of the matter. On the basis of the information, the chief justice has asked the administrative committee of the court to conduct a probe, said a senior high court official on Monday.

 The administrative committee has sought a report from the chief judicial magistrate of Sealdah court, who has already been briefed by the railway magistrate.

 The committee will also ask the Eastern Railway authorities to furnish a report. After receiving both reports, the committee will submit its report, added the official. 

 Eastern Railway officials held a meeting on Monday to review Saturdays collapse of railway operations. Dipak Sarkar, driver of the Budge Budge-Sealdah local that Mallick had boarded, lodged a formal complaint with the railway police.

 Memorial museum fee low: HC

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court wants the entry fee of the Victoria Memorial Hall museum to be on a par with that of other monuments and historical museums.

 The division bench headed by Justice B. Bhattacharya on Friday asked green activist Subhas Dutta to prepare a list of entry fees charged by the Taj Mahal, Red Fort, Nizams Museum in Hyderabad and other historical museums.

 The court, while hearing Duttas petition on pollution around the Memorial, expressed dissatisfaction over the fact that the museum entry fee is only Rs 10. We think the fee should be hiked for better upkeep of the monument, it observed.

 City police chief Prasun Mukherjee tabled an affidavit, praying for time to ensure smooth flow of traffic around the Memorial to curb pollution.

 The bench asked the police to take the necessary steps by Puja 2007. The court also stressed the need for 24-hour vigil around the complex to prevent parking of vehicles. The police should take an initiative to prevent morning walkers from parking their cars near the complex gate.

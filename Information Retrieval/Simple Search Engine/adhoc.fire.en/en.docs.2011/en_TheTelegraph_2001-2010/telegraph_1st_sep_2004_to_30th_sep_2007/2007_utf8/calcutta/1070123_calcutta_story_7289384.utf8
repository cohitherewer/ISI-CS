The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Virtual rage erupts over fair menace

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Book Fair should not be 

 held on the Maidan. If it is held there, people should boycott 

 it. The government is to be blamed for the problem 

 a post on the discussion page of a community of Book Fair 

 lovers on Orkut, the social networking website now a rage.

 The virtues of shifting the Book Fair out of the Maidan are visible to the virtual world, but in the real world, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Co. remain blind to the danger posed to the citys precious patch of green.

 On Monday, the Publishers and Booksellers Guild, the local army authority, city police and state government agencies filed affidavits before the high court on staging Book Fair 2007 from January 31.

 The discussion in the Book Fair communities on Orkut revolves around the best stalls and the fondest memories. The chorus for a new venue, however, has now drowned the nostalgia notes. With the mauling of the Maidan having begun, more and more members are joining the protests.

 Even the owner of the community on Orkut, Amlan Ray, currently in New Jersey, feels that the Book Fair should be moved from the Maidan.

 On the ground, the green brigade is closing ranks against the Maidans marauders. Green activists and people who feel for the environment have decided to form the Calcutta Green Network. Our plan of action will be announced on Tuesday, said Subhas Dutta, whose petition to save Victoria Memorial sparked the save the Maidan movement.

 Green activists like Chiro Dutta, Sibabrata Chatterjee and S.M. Ghosh have joined the Network. Lt Col S.R. Banerjee of WWF and former CBI honcho Upen Biswas have expressed support.

 With the chief minister, the environment minister and the state pollution control board silent on the Maidan issue, it is up to the green lobby to save it from the Book Fair, states the new forum.

 Buddha 

 promise: Inaugurating the Industrial India Trade Fair 

 at the Salt Lake stadium Helipad ground, the chief minister 

 on Monday said the permanent fairground, off EM Bypass, 

 will be ready by next year. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee even 

 said he felt bad for the inconvenience caused to Bengal 

 National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, organisers of 

 the trade event shifted out of the Maidan.

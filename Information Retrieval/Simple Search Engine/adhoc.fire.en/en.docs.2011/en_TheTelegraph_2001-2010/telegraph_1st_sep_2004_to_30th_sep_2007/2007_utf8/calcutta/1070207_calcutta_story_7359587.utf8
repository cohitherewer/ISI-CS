 Low-fat food and high-intensity fitness routine top the diet charts of Team India in the run-up to the Eden Gardens showdown on Thursday. The only exception celebrating S. Sreesanths birthday at Pizza Hut. The 22 Camac Street address was the venue for the pacers 24th birthday bash late on Tuesday, attended by some young guns.

 Earlier in the day, Team India trickled into town. Players dropped in, almost one by one. Hardly anyone came in together and Sachin, Zaheer and Agarkar are yet to arrive, revealed a spokesperson for Taj Bengal late on Tuesday.

 Big guns Rahul Dravid, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh and, of course, Greg Chappell chose room service for lunch. Special instructions have been given to the chefs to prepare low-fat, non-greasy and non-fried food. The special diet for the team as set in consultation with the team dietician and coach will have no cheese and no red meat, but include light white meat and plenty of fruits, added the spokesperson.

 Frugal with food and full-on with fitness seems to be the mantra in the countdown to World Cup 07. For that, the newly-renovated Taj Salon and Spa is where the team members are sure to spend a lot of time during their 72-hour stay.

 The word is out that Indian crickets big boys will not be allowed to play at night on the eve of the ODI versus Sri Lanka, but that hasnt stopped the party places from making their plans. We are keeping Babushka shots (Red Bull Effect energy drink with a dash of peach or lime) and non-alcoholic Caipiroska ready, with a platter of mixed kebabs, said Sovan Mukherjee, manager, Shisha Hookah Bar.

 With Dada back (and how!) Souravs: The Food Pavilion is all padded up. Nothing is confirmed, but we hope to host a dinner after the match, said Saikat Sarkar, general manager, Souravs.

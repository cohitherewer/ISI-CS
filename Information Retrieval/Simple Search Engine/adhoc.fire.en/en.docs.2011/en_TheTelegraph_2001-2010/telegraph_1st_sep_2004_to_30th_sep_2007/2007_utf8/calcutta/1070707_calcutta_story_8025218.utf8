 Pointers make a mark

 Catch it!

 South Point High School has been honouring achievers since 1995 at their annual prize distribution ceremony. This year, the school organised its annual prize distribution ceremony at Science City Auditorium on July 4. Three hundred and eighty eight students from the school were honoured, not including the special awards, informed Jayati Solomon, principal, South Point High School. Despite it being a rain-drenched afternoon, there was no dearth of eager parents who wanted to take photographs of their wards. 

 Mohammed Arif, this years Madhyamik topper, was given the M.P. Birla Memorial Award and a cash prize of Rs 7,500. For Arif, a student of Al Amin Mission, the honour was unexpected. The resident of Hatpara village in Nabagram whose brothers run a grocery shop, getting an aggregate of 795 was not really unexpected. When asked if he would use the money for his education, he said that he would rather give it at home. 

Pramit Kumar Paul, a student of Class II who suffers from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia was awarded the Priyamvada Birla Bravehearts Award, carrying with it a cash prize of Rs 5,000. Despite his illness that requires him to take chemotherapy sessions once every week, he balances his studies with lessons in light karate and swimming. Father Paresh Kumar Paul, a school teacher himself, said: Pramit refuses to let his studies suffer in any way. For us, the recognition of his effort means more than the money. Rik Sengupta of Class XII, the only Indian selected to participate in the six-week Summer Science Programme organised by California Institute of Technology, Stanford University and University of California, Los Angeles, received the M.P. Birla Toppers Award. Rik is away at the camp now.

 The school also gave away passage money for studying abroad to two ex-students of the school, Balsubramaniam Ganesh and Anupam Roy. Ganesh is headed for the US to study engineering mechanics at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, in August, while Anupam, a Political Science student at St Xaviers College, is headed to the UK to do a course in three-year undergrad music at Oxford. 

 The day finished with two dance presentations Living in Harmony (picture by Anindya Shankar Ray), performed by students from classes II and V and Abhiyatra performed by students of classes VI to XII.

 Warnie in the making?

 Priyank Bengani eats, drinks and breathes cricket. Ask the Bengal Under-15 cricketer what he would like to become if he cannot make it big in cricket for some reason, and he is at a loss. After much introspection he tells you: I dont know. I havent thought about it. And thats just the way to go about it. Becoming a successful cricketer is not a matter of choice for Priyank. Its his only option. 

 Priyank played in four of the six matches in the series between the Bengal and Bangladesh Under-15 teams earlier this year. Yet, he emerged the highest wicket-taker on both sides, claiming 14 wickets with his right-arm leg-spin. 

 Former Bengal wicketkeeper Rajesh Dani, who coaches the state Under-15 side, says that Priyank has a bright future in cricket. Priyanks bowling was right up there in the top drawer. Also, his fielding has improved immensely from what I saw four months ago. Priyank is a bowling all-rounder. 

 A Class VIII student of M.P. Birla Foundation Higher Secondary School, Priyank practices at Sourav Gangulys Videocon School of Cricket in Salt Lake. Apart from playing the game, he watches all the cricket matches on television. Having modelled his action on Shane Warne, he nurtures a wish to meet his idol one day.

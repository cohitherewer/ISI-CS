 Boy falls into canal at Dhapa

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A seven-year old boy fell into the storm water flow channel of the Dhapa lock pumping station on Tuesday morning and couldnt be traced till the evening. To help the search operation, the Dhapa lock pumping station did not pump out water on Tuesday.

 Acting chief engineer (drainage and sewerage department) Tushar Ghosh said the boy fell into the channel while playing on its bank and was swept away.

 Officials in the drainage department feared that the body had got embedded in the silt, since two-thirds of the channel is filled with silt.

 If the body is not embedded in the silt, then it could have been traced at Bantala, an official pointed out.

 Engineers of the drainage department said since pumps were not run on Tuesday morning, they will have to be operated after 11pm on Tuesday to clear the pits. 

 About nine years ago, a boy fell into a manhole at Ultadanga and went missing. 

 A girl, too, had slipped through an inspection pit at the Palta waterworks.

 The power within

 The grossly capitalist, decadent society of the modern world has brought in its wake an acute perception of the need to survive and protect oneself against all odds. Based on Arnold Weskers Roots, this evenings maiden performance of Jakhan Eka (a scene from the play appears right) portrays a young womans solitary struggle against oppression and her ultimate journey towards self-consciousness. Having grown up in abject poverty, Bithi finds a job in Delhi and is naturally amazed and delighted to get the taste of a life that promises hope, freedom and love. The gradual unfolding of a world hitherto unknown to her, enkindles in her a flame of awareness. She meets Chinmoy, a young labour leader, and learns to discover the world through his eyes. Chinmoy eventually refuses to marry her, and she is also disowned by her own family. Being thus doubly rejected, Bithi looks desperately for support and, strangely enough, finds within herself a core of strength that she never knew to be there before. Direction: Asit Basu.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Jakhan Eka, produced by Samskar Bharati When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts

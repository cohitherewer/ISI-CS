The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Saved, but wanting to die

 - Man rescued from Metro Rail tracks insists he kill himself

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Swapan Banerjee made one request to his saviours to let him die.

 I have left behind a suicide note at home. Please let me die, the 45-year-old unemployed man pleaded with passengers at Jatin Das Park Metro Railway station, while still standing on the tracks.

 Moments before that, Banerjees suicide attempt on Thursday morning had been thwarted by the driver of a Tollygunge-bound train, who slammed the brakes in time.

 It was around 10.10am when Banerjee, a resident of Ishwar Ganguly Street, in Kalighat, stepped on to the crowded platform after buying a Rs-4 ticket.

 He was behaving strangely, looking upset and lost, said a Metro Rail official.

 As the Tollygunge-bound train was entering the platform at 10.18am, Banerjee climbed down on to the tracks. He did not jump, but slowly got off the platform and stood on the tracks, said a witness.

 Driver S.N. Banerjee had spotted the man and with the train rolling in slowly six of the eight coaches had entered the station he quickly brought it to a halt.

 As soon as the train stopped, passengers on the platform jumped down to rescue Banerjee. The driver and Metro Rail officials joined in.

 They requested Banerjee to get back on to the platform, but he refused. He said he had left a suicide note at home and so he must die, said an official. He pleaded with us to let him die.

 Banerjee relented after much persuasion and was handed over to a team from Bhowanipore police station.

 He was a bit incoherent in his statements. We handed him over to his family, said an officer.

 Police learnt from Banerjees family that he was unemployed. He once worked in a shop, the officer added.

 A Metro Rail official said Banerjee was saved as the trains speed was slow and the driver was alert. The train was delayed by seven minutes but there was no major disruption.

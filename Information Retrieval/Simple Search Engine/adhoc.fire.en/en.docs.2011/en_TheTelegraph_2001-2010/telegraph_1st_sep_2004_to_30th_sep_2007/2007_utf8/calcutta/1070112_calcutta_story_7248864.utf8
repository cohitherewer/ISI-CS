 The missing Scout from Maharashtra

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Three days have passed since a 

 15-year-old Scout from Maharashtra went missing in Baguiati, 

 but cops remain clueless about his whereabouts.

 Anil Harishchandra had come to 

 Rajarhat for the six-day Special National Jamboree of the 

 Bharat Scouts and Guides, marking 100 years of the Scout 

 movement.

 All 16,000 boys and girls from all over the country and beyond who took part in the meet have returned home, but there is no news of Anil.

 The teenager had set out for his Mumbai home along with the Maharashtra team on January 8, the day of the bandh. He was last spotted in Baguiati.

 We received a complaint from the Scouts group about Anil on Monday and alerted all police stations to trace the boy, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24 Parganas).

 The Scouts and Guides team from Maharashtra got in touch with the West Bengal State Association of The Bharat Scouts and Guides to file a complaint with Rajarhat police station. We have taken all necessary steps after learning of the incident, said Siddhartha Mukherjee, a senior official at the camp. The CID took up the case of the missing Scout on January 10.

 According to police, the Maharashtra team took a bus from Joramandir, near Baguiati, which Anil missed. He boarded the next bus. Bandh supporters were stopping buses on VIP Road. The first bus was allowed passage after police intervened, but the next bus was stopped and so Anil got off, said an investigating officer.

 A group of teachers from Madhya Pradesh then spotted the boy in front of a retail outlet in Baguiati. Anil told them he had got separated from his team and was buying some things for his family members.

 Asking him to wait in front of the mall, the teachers went to round up the other team members. But when they returned after 15 minutes, Anil was nowhere to be found, police added.

 Not ruling out the possibility of Anil returning home on his own, police are trying to contact his family in Mumbai.

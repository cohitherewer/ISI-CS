 An artistic journey

 Artists tend to be travellers, roaming the world in search of aesthetic enrichment, or in the more philosophical, intellectual sense of exploring the subtleties and depths of human nature. Danville Chadbournes recent visit to India has been like a dream fulfilled. All the sculptures on show at the ongoing exhibition of his works, were created at Artspace, Baruipur, where he has worked throughout last month. His sculptures have been done entirely using local clay, thus relating the pieces to their natural environment. Chadbournes sculptures include strong, colourful, graphic elements, his incised, painted ceramic forms defying typical Western associations with functionality and conventional processes. His use of wood, metal, bone or beaded attachments suggests a sort of obscure, indefinite ritualistic purpose. Choosing to work with natural materials and processes, his images are timeless and culturally non-specific, though they appear to have a specific esoteric dimension. Non-literal, non-narrative and non-representational, they nevertheless suggest an organic familiarity. The ultimate traveller, transmitting and translating ideas, forms and experiences, he invites his viewers to come along for a ride.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings and sculptures by Danville Chadbourne When: Till March 9; 12 noon - 7 pm Where: Artspace India, 7 Deodar Street

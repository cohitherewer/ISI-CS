 Civic fanfare a farce

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A year ago, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya had announced a slew of schemes which he promised would minimise waterlogging in monsoon 2007.

 A year later, the promise was but a cruel joke, as the city struggled to keep itself afloat.

 In July 2006, the mayor had promised to set up two more drainage pumping stations at Marcus Square and Gokhale Road, a bypass sewer for MM Burman Street, bigger sewers under Congress Exhibition Road and Gariahat Road, desilting of sewers under AJC Bose Road and Camac Street and replacement of all old pumps. The schemes together would cost the civic coffers Rs 200 crore.

 Not a single project has been completed, while some are still on paper.

 The mayor, however, blamed Wednesdays waterlogging on non-availability of power for three hours at Chowbhaga pumping station. As for the civic bodys performance, he said he was satisfied.

 Acting chief engineer (drainage and sewerage) Tushar Ghosh said the high tide in the Hooghly did not allow the civic body to drain out water directly to the river before noon. 

 Water started receding faster only after the onset of the ebb tide, when all the Pen Stock gates were opened.

 The civic body operated 50 pumps that can officially drain out 500 million gallons of water an hour. But they managed to drain out less than 200 million gallons an hour.

 Its true that more than half the pumps need to be replaced, as their efficiency has gone down, said Ghosh.

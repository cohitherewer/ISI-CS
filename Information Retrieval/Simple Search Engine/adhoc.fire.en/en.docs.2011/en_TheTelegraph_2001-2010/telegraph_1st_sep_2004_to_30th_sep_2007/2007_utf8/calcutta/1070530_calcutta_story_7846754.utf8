 The CBSE Class X results brought glad tidings to the city schools on Tuesday. Students of both government-controlled Kendriya Vidyalayas and private schools, including some of the citys best institutions, have fared well.

 The private schools claimed a pass percentage of 100. The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sanghathan authorities said the success rate in its 54 schools in and around the city had gone up by six per cent from last year. 

 I was overwhelmed by the performance of my girls in mathematics. Thirteen students have scored 100 out of 100 in math. Six of them are girls, said Anindita Chatterjee, principal, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, in Salt Lake.

 Malini Bhagat of Mahadevi Birla Girls School echoed her counterpart: Five of my students have scored 100 in math. According to her, like in many other schools, her students have also done well in English and Hindi.

 The math and social science question pattern in the examination will change from next year. The number of multiple-choice and short-answer questions will be increased, said CBSE chairman Ashok Ganguly.

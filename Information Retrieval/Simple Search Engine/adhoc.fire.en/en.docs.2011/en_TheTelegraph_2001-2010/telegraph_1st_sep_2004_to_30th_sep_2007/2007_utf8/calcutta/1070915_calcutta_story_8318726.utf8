 The CBI on Friday arrested a city-based businessman on Friday morning on charges of duping a nationalised bank of Rs 1.18 crore by submitting forged documents. 

 Three associates of the businessman, Ujjwal Das, were also rounded up for helping him forge the documents.

 A team from the CBIs economic offences wing picked up Das, who owns a guest house, from his Ballygunge Place home. His aides in the net are Amiya Kundu, Utpal Dalui and Bikodhar Mallik. They have been remanded in CBI custody till September 18.

 A CBI spokesperson said Das had applied for a loan of Rs 1.18 crore from the Sealdah branch of UCO Bank a couple of years ago to open a chain of eateries across the city.

 The bank granted him the loan after Das handed over documents of his property as security, said the officer.

 Officials of the bank realised they had been duped when Das stopped paying his equated monthly instalments a few months after taking the loan. The bank sent him a number of reminders, which Das ignored, said the officer. The bank then decided to freeze his property.

 But all the papers submitted by Das turned out to be forged. There was no existence of the properties mentioned in the documents. The bank then lodged a complaint with the CBI.

 The sleuths arrested Das and after interrogating him, they came to know about the trios involvement in the scam. The three helped Das forge the documents against a payment, said another officer.

 The CBI has not ruled out the involvement of a section of bank officials in the scam.

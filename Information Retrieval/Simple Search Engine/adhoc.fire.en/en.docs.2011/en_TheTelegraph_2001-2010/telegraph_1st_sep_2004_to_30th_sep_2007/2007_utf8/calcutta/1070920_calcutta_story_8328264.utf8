The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 150 acres freed for realty

 SUBHRO SAHA

 At a time when scarcity of land has been pushing property prices steadily northward, Calcuttas real estate trade has been bolstered by a 150-acre windfall, with an ailing public-sector behemoth reinventing to stay afloat.

 National Textile Corporation (NTC) Ltd has sold nine of its 12 sick units on the fringes of the city lock, stock and barrel through open tenders for conversion into residential or commercial properties.

 The transactions have yielded over Rs 150 crore till date, all of which will be pumped into modernisation of our three operational mills, according to the BIFR (Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction) directive, NTC managing director R.C. Tiwari told Metro.

 The campuses of the nine NTC mills, idling since 2002-03, add up to 150 acres. Most of these are located in Hooghly and North 24-Parganas districts and will be converted into housing estates or shopping malls by the new owners.

 While the Happy Group of Companies has snapped up four mills, the Sugam Park Group has acquired two, one each being picked up by Forum Projects and Paharpur Cooling Towers. 

 A four-acre campus in Lake Town, sold earlier, went to a Hyderabad firm.

 The state government has allowed the conversion of the industrial land into residential or commercial properties in principle, added Tiwari. While the liquidity has enabled NTC to settle the dues of 3,000 workers, it has also given the PSU an upgrade lifeline.

 Calcuttas real estate fraternity has hailed the win-win land-sale move, hoping it will enthuse other ailing units to follow suit. Its definitely a positive trend. If supply of land goes up, it could correct property prices, and benefit the consumer in the long run, said Pradeep Sureka, the president of Credai Bengal.

 Pradip Chopra of the PS Group, the erstwhile secretary of the developers body, agreed that this was the way forward. Sick units must reinvent by agreeing to conversion of their idle premises. The land banks thus freed can give the real estate market a real boost, Chopra felt.

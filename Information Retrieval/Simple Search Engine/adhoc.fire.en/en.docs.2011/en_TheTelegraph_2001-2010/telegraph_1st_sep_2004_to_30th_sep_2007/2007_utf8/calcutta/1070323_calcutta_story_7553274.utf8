The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 CU scurry for swift results

 - Spot evaluation, raised 

rates for script examiners

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The Delhi diktat to all universities to maintain a uniform academic calendar has forced Calcutta University (CU) to draw up measures to speed up the evaluation process.

 Spot evaluation, use of technology for greater accuracy, and increased remuneration for examiners are some of the guidelines put down by the universitys undergraduate council. The recommendations will be placed before the syndicate for final approval.

 To ensure easy mobility of students from one institution of higher education to another across the country, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has sent a directive to all universities to maintain a uniform academic calendar by completing the process of holding undergraduate and postgraduate examinations by June-July.

 For this, CU must cut down on the 70-plus days it takes to declare results. Spot evaluation must be introduced if we have to abide by the UGC directive, said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic). This will speed up evaluation for all undergraduate and postgraduate examinations.

 Spot evaluation involves examiners sitting at a centralised location to check scripts. At present, spot evaluation is carried out only for subjects in which the number of examinees is low. Otherwise, spot evaluation is used as an emergency measure when there is a real shortage of examiners.

 Spot evaluation apart, the introduction of a hi-tech system to make the evaluation process fool-proof and raised remuneration for examiners to involve more efficient teachers in the evaluation process are on the anvil.

 The guidelines adopted by the undergraduate council are based on the 40-page report submitted by a team of officials that had travelled to Chennai, Mumbai and Delhi to examine the evaluation process that enabled them to declare undergraduate and post-graduate examination results within 30-45 days.

 According to Das, for total revamp and modernisation of the examination system, the report recommends revision of the universitys existing rules for affiliating colleges and also its present course and curriculum structure. 

 The team has also suggested introduction of credit transfer and semester system for all undergraduate and post-graduate courses.

 Evening Star gets brightest

 MUCH LIKE THE MOON: The planet Venus. (AFP)

 Venus, getting brighter by the day for the past month, will be brightest on July 12.

 The Evening Star will loom low in the western sky just after dark on July 12 and will shine with a magnitude of minus 4.5.

 Astronomers said the phenomenon occurs in the weeks before Venus passes between Earth and the Sun. The passage falls on August 18, when Venus will go eight degrees below or south of the sun. The phenomenon repeats itself once or twice every two years.

 The orbit of Venus lies inside Earths orbit. Venus goes through phases, much like the moon. On July 12, only 25 per cent of the disc of Venus will appear illuminated from Earth. Yet, thanks to its closeness to Earth, it will shine more brightly than the full Venus as seen by us, explained Mrinal Kanti Pal Ray, of Positional Astronomy Centre.

 People can see the planet with the naked eye after sunset (it appears in the western sky after sunset and in the eastern sky before sunrise). However, when seen through binoculars, the planet will look larger but only 25 per cent of the disc will be visible.

 When Venus comes around from behind the Sun, it is very far away and appears quite small. As it moves towards us, it turns more and more of its dark side towards Earth. Thus, it becomes larger, though the sunlit side gets smaller. The planet is getting dimmer but its closeness to Earth during this phase overrides the dimness, Ray said.

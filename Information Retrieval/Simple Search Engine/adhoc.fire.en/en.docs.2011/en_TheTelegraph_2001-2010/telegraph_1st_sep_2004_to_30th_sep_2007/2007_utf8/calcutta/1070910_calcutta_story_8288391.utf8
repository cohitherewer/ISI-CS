 Port roads prompt civic prod 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has urged the port trust to thoroughly repair roads in the port area before the Puja.

 During a pre-Puja coordination meeting between agencies, civic deputy chief engineer (civil) Soumitra Bhattacharya told the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) representative that the overall condition of the city roads now is better than what it was at this time last year. However, four major arteries near the port Strand Bank Road, Taratala Road, Circular Garden Reach Road (from ITC to Old Dock) and Remount Street have been in terrible shape for a long time.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, additional police commissioner Prabir Chatterjee and representatives of the CMDA, the fire brigade, the state pollution control board, CESC and Calcutta Telephones attended the meeting.

 Besides the CMC, the CMDA, PWD, CPT and the HRBC maintain roads in the city but whenever people find a road in bad shape, they blame only the civic body. We have been repeatedly asking the other agencies to hand over the roads to us but they are reluctant to do that, said mayoral council member (roads) Tuhin Bera.

 It was decided at the meeting that plastic bags would be banned in pandals and puja organisers would have to approach the parks and gardens wing of the CMC for permission to trim trees. The engineers of the wing will decide on trimming.

 The police will take action against the secretary of a community puja if there is an attempt at trimming trees without our consent, said mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan. Like last year, the civic body will set up enclosures in ghats where trash will be dumped during immersion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Funds allotted for drainage

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) informed the high court on Tuesday that the Centre has granted it a fund of Rs 80 crore for setting up four pumping stations in the city.

 The city will be rid of waterlogging once the pumping stations are in place and the drainage canals desilted, the CMC said in an affidavit, filed in the court in response to a petition by environment activist Subhas Dutta.

 Following the July 3 downpour that inundated several areas in the city, Dutta and two lawyers had pleaded for the courts intervention in solving the problems faced by the people. Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar had asked the three to file cases on the issue.

 The petitioner did not hold the CMC responsible for waterlogging and claimed that the canals are not being cleaned because of lack of communication among state government departments. Desilting work has already started, the affidavit said.

 The CMC claimed that the citys unfortunate geographical position and the development of Salt Lake and New Town had disrupted the drainage system.

 The civic authorities are finally paying heed to the problem, but a lot more needs to be done. The CMC will have to overhaul the drainage system, petitioner Dutta said.

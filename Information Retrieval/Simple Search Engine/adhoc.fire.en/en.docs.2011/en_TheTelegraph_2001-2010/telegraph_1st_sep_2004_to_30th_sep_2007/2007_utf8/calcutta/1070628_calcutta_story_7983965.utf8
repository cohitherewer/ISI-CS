 A domestic help from Orissa has been arrested on charges of stealing Rs 1.5 lakh and ornaments worth Rs 2.45 lakh from the house of her employer on Loudon Street. The helps husband is absconding.

 Sunita, rounded up from Jaripara, in Orissas Khurdah district, and husband Kailash had been working for Tapan Ghosh, a chartered accountant, for over a decade.

 They duped him into believing that they needed Rs 1.5 lakh for their daughters marriage, offering to have the amount deducted from their monthly pay, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Ajoy Kumar.

 In May, Ghosh gave the couple two cheques for Rs 70,000 and Rs 80,000, drawn on his account at the Shakespeare Sarani branch of HSBC bank. 

 The two left for Orissa on May 20, saying the marriage would be held five days later. 

 A few days after the couple left, Ghosh realised that almost all his household jewellery, around 30 bhari of gold, was missing, said Hiren Das, officer-in-charge of Shakespeare Sarani thana.

 A police team reached Jaripara in search of the couple. On June 24, the cops managed to track down Sunita and recovered Rs 44,000 and 12 bhari of ornaments.

 We hope to catch Kailash soon, said Das.

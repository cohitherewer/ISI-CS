 Scanner on Bangla goons

 - Criminals have settled down as businessmen, say cops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A missive from the Interpol has prompted the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to launch a hunt for Bangladeshi gangsters holed up in and around the city for years.

 The letter, issued by the CBI, which acts as the nodal agency of the Interpol in India, mentioned the names of 24 gangsters wanted for serious offences in Bangladesh.

 Among them are Subrata Bain, Mollah Masud, Agha Shamim and Jahangir. We are collecting information about them, said a CID officer.

 Besides, there are another 70-odd criminals, hiding in the city and its suburbs, who are wanted by Bangladesh police for crimes like murder and extortion, he added.

 The CBIs letter followed the arrest of two Bangladeshi gangsters, Tanveer-ul-Islam and Hariz Ahmed, alias Mohammad Hassan, by the special operations group of the CID.

 Tanveer, picked up from an apartment in Rajarhat, was allegedly involved in a grenade attack on an Awami League rally in Dhaka in 2004. The blast killed 24 people. After interrogating him, police rounded up five of his associates.

 Hariz, arrested in Kaikhali, has more than 42 murder cases pending against him. Some of his alleged victims were senior political leaders.

 In its letter to the CID, the CBI has wished to take the two in its custody. We will hand them over to the CBI after verifying whether they have committed any crime in the city, said an officer of the special operations group. Interpol had issued a red-corner notice against them long ago.

 Rajeev Kumar, deputy inspector-general of police, CID (operations), said: Most of the gangsters we are looking for have settled here in the guise of businessmen.

 About the Bangladeshi criminals who are not on the Interpol list, Kumar said: If our probe reveals that they have not committed any crime here, apart from entering India without a valid passport and visa, they will be booked under the Foreigners Act and pushed back into their country.

 As part of the drive against Bangladeshi goons who have set up base in and around the city, sleuths have prepared a map identifying pockets that are likely to be used as hideouts. 

 Central Calcutta is one of the sensitive zones. Areas like Jorasanko, Jorabagan and Posta have turned into a haven for criminals from across the border. Recently, our officers and teams from Calcutta police have netted several Bangladeshis from these areas, said a senior CID officer.

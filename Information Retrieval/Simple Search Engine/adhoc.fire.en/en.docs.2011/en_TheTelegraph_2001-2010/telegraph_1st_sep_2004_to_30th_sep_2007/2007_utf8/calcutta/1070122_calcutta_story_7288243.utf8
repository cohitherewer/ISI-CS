 Tribute to a maestro

 Ecstasy is a word that best describes Dilip Kumar Roy, the prolific poet and soul-stirring composer. A visionary in the true sense of the term, his spiritual ideal demystified the prevalent ethos, which was reflected in his songs and writings. Roys study of Indian classical music is exemplary and his literature manifests the spirited patriot whose internationalism can be considered a doctrine in todays distressing global environment. Surakavya Trust, headed by Raka Sen, offers its tribute to the maestro through a collage of dramatised reading and music. The evening begins with an oration by Prof. Alokeranjan Dasgupta. Next on the cards is an enactment by Barun Chanda and ideator Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee, who essays the roles of Romain Rolland and Dilip Kumar Roy. The concluding item is a music recital by Haimanti Shukla. The programme is knit together by Biswajit Ganguly and painter Shuvaprasanna.

 You share your birthday with...

 you share your bday with...

 Robin Williams

 Your creative juices are always at work and your ideas are always interesting. You are a serious worker and cannot tolerate lackadaisical attitude of co-workers. Although you are stern, you also know the value of having fun. You have a strong sixth sense whereby you can analyse a situation correctly without studying it in detail.

 Youths in net for assault on teacher

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A teacher of a government school was critically injured after being beaten up by two youths in Bhatpara, on the northern fringes of the city, on Thursday.

 The teachers fault: he dared to protest after being knocked down by the youths, who were riding a bicycle.

 Partha Bhattacharya, who teaches at Sodepur High School, is being treated at a Salt Lake nursing home. The youths, Bhatu Mondal and Bappai Das, were arrested on Sunday night following an FIR lodged by the teachers father and wife.

 The incident occurred at Pumppukur, in Bhatpara, while Partha was returning home from school. He fell after Bhatu and Bappai, who were riding a bicycle, hit him from behind, said an officer of Jagaddal police station.

 After collecting himself, Partha protested the youths behaviour. The two then hit my husband on his forehead. As he fell, they started kicking and punching him, said Ratna, Parthas wife. They also abused him and warned him not to lecture anyone other than his students, she added.

 The youths fled on seeing some local residents rushing in to Parthas rescue.

 They brought him to his house, from where Partha was taken to Bhatpara State General Hospital and then to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. As his condition deteriorated, he was admitted to a nursing home in Salt Lake, said a relative of the teacher.

 At a time when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has been wooing retail giants, a city retailer, unable to open his stores for three months because of labour trouble, has complained of lack of protection.

 CitiMart, the readymade apparel store in the Lighthouse cinema building, has been closed since May 24 following a management-staff stand-off. The outlet opened on Thursday following a high court order barring picketing, but trouble still brews. Metro takes stock:

 Courtspeak: The high court 

 order passed on August 29, 2007, by Justice Soumitra Pal 

 said CitiMart, at Lighthouse building, should be opened 

 at once and requested the New Market police station officer-in-charge 

 (OC) to ensure that no obstruction occurs. Copies were 

 marked to the deputy commissioner (central) and the commissioner 

 of police.

 Ownerspeak: Today, I have 

 the second-largest retail format in Calcutta after Big Bazaar, 

 with 90,000 sq ft of sales area, and the government doesnt 

 give me any protection. I have been held to ransom by some 

 hooligans, who wont let any customer enter the store, blatantly 

 violating court orders. They are heckling anybody who dares 

 to enter the store. The New Market OC pleads helplessness, 

 saying Ill be transferred to the dog squad if I evict 

 them forcibly. Where do I go for justice now? John Mantosh.

 Unionspeak: The management 

 retrenched 98 permanent employees and wants them back only 

 as contractual staff. John Mantosh cant do this without 

 any proper closure notice. We havent used force or abusive 

 language against any customer. He has to give the retrenched 

 staff proper benefits and adequate compensation. Prabhakar 

 Mandal, leader of the Citu-affiliated staff union.

 Biotech leap in diagnosis

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA 

 Diagnosis of diseases in the city will soon receive a boost, with a state-run healthcare centre preparing to set up a medical biotechnology unit.

 Once the Rs 5-crore project is commissioned the deadline is August the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine will be Indias second unit, after a Chandigarh-based hospital, to have the sophisticated facility.

 In the conventional approach, diagnosis depends on the report of the pathologist and the doctors clinical experience. The margin of error in the process is very high, explained Samaresh Chaudhuri, head of the project and senior professor at the School.

 But using biotechnology, we can detect a disease probing at the cellular or molecular level. The system, with a near-zero margin of error, gives an authentic picture of the ailment and also cuts down on the waiting period, he added.

 Citing an example, Chaudhuri said: In case of cancer, a conventional biopsy takes eight to 10 days. The new technique will do the job in just 48 hours.

 The unit will also boost stem-cell research, being conducted in the School since 1996. There will be close collaboration between the stem-cell unit and the new set-up, said Chaudhuri, whose team is now working overtime to install around 20 machines in the biotech laboratory.

 Stem cell holds the key to the treatment of diseases like leukaemia, thalassaemia and aplastic anaemia which require regular blood transfusion or bone marrow transplant. Stem-cell therapy increases the life-expectancy of patients and also cuts down on the cost of treatment to a great extent, said Chaudhuri.

 If conventional therapy costs Rs 50 lakh to keep a patient alive for 15 years, stem- cell technology will cost between Rs 7,000 and Rs 10,000, he claimed.

 Terming the biotechnology project Calcuttas pride, director of health services Sanchita Bakshi said: The project is very exciting. Our goal is to provide quality treatment to the poor at an affordable rate.

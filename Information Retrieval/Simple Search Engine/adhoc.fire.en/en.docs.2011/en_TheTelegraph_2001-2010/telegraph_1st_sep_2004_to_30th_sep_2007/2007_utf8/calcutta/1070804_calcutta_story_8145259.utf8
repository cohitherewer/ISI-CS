The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Harassment on Metro

 SUVRA DEY

 As a journalist, I am used to working late and taking overcrowded public transport. Like all women, I have had to suffer passes made by co-passengers but I never felt as humiliated as I did on Thursday evening.

 I took the 7.46pm Dum Dum-bound Metro from Chandni Chowk and jostled through the crowd of passengers to reach the ladies section of a compartment. As I reached for the overhead rod to steady myself, I felt a mans palm on my hand. I shifted my hand and the mans hand followed mine. I asked him sternly to move his hand, but he simply smiled through his moustache and came closer. 

 He was in his mid-50s, well-dressed, carrying a briefcase and chewing paan masala nonchalantly.

 I asked him to behave himself. He pretended to look away and started making lewd remarks. By that time, the train had reached Girish Park and many passengers had got off. Some of those still on the train weakly protested and asked him to move away from the ladies section. He turned a deaf ear. 

 The other women in the compartment, too, were feeling uncomfortable and protested, but to no avail.

 The torture continued till I reached my destination, Belgachhia. The man also got off and walked past me with a sardonic smile. I couldnt take it any more. I rushed to the policemen at the station and urged them to take down my complaint.

 The men in uniform were courteous. They encouraged me and praised me for being brave. I dont know if the protest was born out of bravery. Inside, I was shattered to pieces. I felt humiliated, helpless and exposed.

 Policespeak: On seeing three officers taking down Suvras complaint, the man sensed trouble. He ran after a private bus and jumped on to the footboard.

 A plainclothesman ran after him and got on the bus. The accused was trying to melt among the passengers. He was made to get off, said an officer.

 The man identified himself as Tushar Kanta Bose, an employee of a nationalised bank. He was taken to Ultadanga police station. We requested Suvra Dey to accompany us and lodge a complaint, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Gyanwant Singh. Bose received bail on Friday.

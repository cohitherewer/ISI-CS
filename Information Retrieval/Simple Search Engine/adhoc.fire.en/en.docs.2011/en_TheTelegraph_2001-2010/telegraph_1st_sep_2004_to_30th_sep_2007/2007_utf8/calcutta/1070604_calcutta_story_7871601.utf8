 A 45-year-old man fought off an armed gang in his jewellery-manufacturing unit in Howrah town on Saturday night.

 The gang fled after Sadhan Roy grabbed the barrel of a pipe-gun one of the robbers had aimed at him just before pressing the trigger. The pellets pierced his right arm.

 An injured Sadhan chased and caught hold of the robber, but the rest fled.

 A hunt is on to track down the criminals. A preliminary probe has revealed that they had been roaming in the area since Saturday afternoon, said an officer of the local Shibpur police station.

 Sadhans workshop is on the ground floor of a two-storeyed building in Shibpur Bazaar, which also houses two other jewellery-manufacturing units. One of them is owned by Sadhans brother Bhajan.

 It was around 10.30pm when two youths entered the building. Bhajan had closed his unit and was standing in front of mine. One of the youths told me that they wanted to place an order. But I asked them to come tomorrow, as I was about to pack up for the day, recalled Sadhan.

 The youths left, but returned soon with two others. Two of them forcibly entered the third jewellery manufacturing unit, adjacent to Sadhans, in the building. 

 The other two came to Sadhans unit. One held a revolver against Bhajans temple and the other ordered me to open the vault and hand over all jewellery items and cash. But I refused, said Sadhan.

 The two said they would kill my brother if I did not carry out their order. I still did not give in and told them they would not be able to leave the building alive if they caused any harm to my brother, he added.

 Hearing it, one of the youths took out a pipe-gun and started walking towards Sadhan. But I pounced on him, held the nozzle and and twisted his hand just before he pulled the trigger. The bullets pierced my right arm, said Sadhan.

 All four robbers panicked after the gunshot and ran out of the building. They were chased by several businessman of the market, who were alerted by the firing. 

 Sadhan, too, ran after the one who had aimed at him and managed to pin him down. He has been identified as Chottu Roy.

 Two of the robbers who had entered the other unit, owned by Osman Mondol, beat up the workers and snatched Rs 2,000 and jewellery worth Rs 10,000 before fleeing.

 Rhythms of Israel

 The Idan Raichel Project burst on the Israeli music scene in 2002, changing the face of Israeli popular music. It offers a message of love and tolerance that resonates strongly in a region whose headlines are often dominated by conflict. With an enchanting blend of Ethiopian and Middle Eastern flavours coupled with sophisticated production techniques and a spectacular live show, the Idan Raichel Project has become one of the most unexpected success stories in Israeli music today. The architect of this unique recording project is Idan Raichel, a 29-year-old keyboard-player, producer and composer from Kfar Saba. In its recordings or on stage, the Project features a fascinating, eclectic array of participants: Cabra Casey (of Ethiopian heritage), Mira Anwar Awad (Arab Israeli), Sergio Braams (Surinam), Bongani Xulung (South Africa), among others. To celebrate the international release of The Idan Raichel Project, a compendium of popular songs from the Projects two Israeli albums, the group has embarked on an international tour to present their powerful and entertaining musical message to new audiences throughout the globe. To commemorate 15 years of Indo-Israel relations, Indian Council for Cultural Relations and Embassy of Israel present the group live in concert. Ethnic rhythms and melodies meet modern Israeli grooves to offer an unforgettable music experience.

 lEvent: A music concert blending ethnic and modern tunes of Israel lWhen: Today at 6.30 pm lWhere: Kala Mandir

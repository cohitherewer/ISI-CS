 Campus scripts RTI

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) is all set to open its doors to students seeking information on answer scripts. 

 With the Right to Information Bill empowering the students to demand information on answer scripts, officials of the fledgling university and principals of the affiliated colleges discussed the various aspects of the law and its impact on the colleges. 

 During the meeting, we discussed some of the issues related to showing answer scripts to the students, said Ashoke Ranjan Thakur, vice-chancellor, WBUT. 

 Around 105 colleges, offering a gamut of professional courses, are affiliated to the WBUT. Over 63,000 students are enrolled in these colleges and the authorities expect the number to go up to 75,000 by 2008. 

 Most of the college principals agreed that in the right to information era, the examination authorities are bound to make answer scripts available on demand. 

 But the participants also stressed on the need to put in place a mechanism to make the process error-free and less chaotic. 

 If a large number of students want to see their answer scripts, it will become chaotic. So, the matter has to be handled properly. We are trying to put in place an appropriate mechanism, said Thakur.

 Though no decision has been taken yet, the WBUT authorities will frame a set of guidelines by the end of this year to make answer scripts available to students.

 The weather office predicted rain in the next 24 hours, even as reports came in of deaths caused probably by the current spell of sweltering heat.

 Tuesdays maximum temperature was 36.1 degrees Celsius, which is normal. On Monday, the mercury had soared to 38.4 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal.

 A 70-year-old man was found unconscious at the crossing of Lock Gate Road and KL Das Road, in Chitpur, around 6 pm on Monday. Local residents took him to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

 Kanhu Murmu, 40, a resident of Jharkhand, was found unconscious under a roadside shelter in Taltala on Tuesday afternoon. He was taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead.

 As the bodies bore no injury marks, police said both might have died unable to bear the scorching heat.

 G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre, said the city might experience rain in the next 24 hours following the development of a cyclonic circulation over Jharkhand and its adjoining areas.

 The phenomenon has sucked in lots of moisture from the Bay, leading to the formation of large columns of thunderclouds over a vast stretch in south Bengal, said Debnath.

 The citys northern suburbs experienced brief spells of gusty winds on Tuesday evening.

 The relief, however, will be brief and we dont expect the mercury to climb below 34 degrees, said an official.

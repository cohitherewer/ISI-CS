 Feud in the family

 In celebration of Soumitra Chattopadhyays 73rd birthday, Mukhomukhi hosts Tiattorey Soumittir, a festival of plays written, directed and acted by the veteran theatre virtuoso. Aarohan, to be staged this evening as part of the festival, is a family drama with a dark, Machiavellian twist. A story of theft and greed, plots and counter-plots, it confronts us with Madhumita, who sees in her brothers new business venture an opportunity to grab the maximum wealth for herself. Driven by evil ambition, she conspires against her brothers. Even her husbands failing health does not deter her from her sinister purpose. No less a match for her, is her brother Tarakdas, who, too, does not hesitate to resort to unethical and immoral means to secure his ends. It shows us a world where siblings are pitted against one another in a bitter rivalry for extracting personal gain. Full of hatred, jealousy, selfishness and animosity, we discover, to our horror, that this world is all too familiar to us. Also being staged today is Pran Tapasya (3 pm).

 Event: Play in Bengali, Aarohan, produced by Mukhomukhi 

When: Today at 6.30 pm 

Where: Academy of Fine Arts

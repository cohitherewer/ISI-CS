 More names in abduct attempt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police have got a few more clues in an abduction case in Howrah.

 Cops claimed that the main suspect Gopal Chakraborty, who tried to abduct two students, had revealed the names of a few more persons involved in a trafficking racket active in Howrah and its adjoining areas.

 He identified the gang leader as Arup Ghosh. 

 On Saturday, Gopal, who worked as a help at a roadside hotel in Jaynagar on National Highway 6, tried to abduct Pusphita Maji, 10, and Pallavi Maji, 13, while they were on their way to school. The girls immediately raised an alarm and Gopal was caught by a few bystanders.

 He reportedly told police during interrogation that Ghosh had promised him to pay Rs 2 lakh if he could abduct the girls.

 Superintendent of police, Howrah, Niraj Kumar Singh, said: We have got a few clues and names after interrogating Gopal. A racket seems to be active in the area.

 Police said the gang Gopal worked for has been involved in several abduction cases and immoral trafficking.

 A few months back, the police had rescued an 18-year-old girl of Golabari from Orissa. Cops said she was was abducted and sold at Sonagachhi, from where she was taken to a brothel in Orissa.

 Last year, a gang had tried to abduct Manika Adak and Piu Samanta, both Class IV students.

 Gopal was produced before the Howrah chief judicial magistrate on Sunday and remanded in police custody for three days, Singh added.

 We are trying to trace Ghosh and the other persons named by Gopal. They will be rounded up soon, said a senior officer of the district police.

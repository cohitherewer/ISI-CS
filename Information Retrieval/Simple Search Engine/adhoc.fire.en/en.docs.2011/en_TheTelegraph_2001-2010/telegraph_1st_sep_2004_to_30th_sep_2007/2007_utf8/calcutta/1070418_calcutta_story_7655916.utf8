 From the margin, scripted in verse

 He has received almost every literary award in the country, from the Gyanpeeth to Sahitya Akademi to Kabir Samman. The state has crowned him with a Padmabhushan, too. Addressing the gathering at the Bharatiya Sanskriti Sansad auditorium last weekend, Sitakant Mahapatra looked back on a career that started with never coming second in class, be it in school or in the three universities he went to Utkal, Allahabad and Cambridge.

 One of his biggest contributions, perhaps, is his work with the oral poetry of a marginalised section of society the tribals. 

 I am fluent in Santhali, says the 70-year-old, whose research in the field of social anthropology took him to tribal pockets like Chhotanagpur and Bolpur. 

 But space for the creative arts is shrinking. Writers are marginalised, he says. 

 This is a greater truth in the case of the vernacular authors. That hardly means the poet who has always written in Oriya is upset. It is not an unmixed blessing. May be from the margin, they can see better, he says, with a twinkle in his eyes.

 In fact, Mahapatra believes writers should not crave the spotlight. The courage of the humble is greater than that of the sloganeering crowd. Anyway, the age of the poet as the seer is past, he reflects.

 Rather, his bigger concern is the lack of quality translators. Though National Book Trust (which he used to head) and Sahitya Akademi are doing their bit, not enough is being done. It will be a pity if Tarashankar Bandyopadhyay is not read by, say, a Malayalee. 

 Mahapatra himself has been translated into Spanish, German, French, Russian and Hebrew other than all major Indian languages. Of the international ones, only the French and German translations were done from the Oriya original.

 Yet, he would not be bogged down. There is a kind of revolution going on in all Indian languages. So many young voices are taking up the pen. It is good to have so many flowers blooming. The problem is of finding readers.

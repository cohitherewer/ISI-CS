 Mishap rerun in Sector V 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Rash driving has claimed yet another life in Salt Lakes Sector V. A 50-year-old interior designer, Balmiki Sharma, died after the motorcycle he was riding rammed into a car at College More on Sunday morning. 

 Police said both vehicles were being driven at a high speed on a stretch that lacks a speed bump. Sharma, a Beleghata resident, was heading for a clients office in New Town around 11.30 am when the mishap occurred.

 A Lancer was coming at a right angle to it. As it tried to whiz past the motorcycle, the driver lost control. The car crossed Sharmas path, leaving him with no time to slow down and change track. He hit the car at a high speed, said an officer of New Town Electronic Complex. 

 Sharma was flung off the motorcycle and received critical injuries in the head and chest. The driver of the car slammed the brakes hard, causing the vehicles to pivot and hit the motorcycle again.

 As Sharma lay on the road writhing in pain, a police jeep patrolling the area reached the spot and took him to a local hospital, where he died. Businessman Manoj Agarwal, 35, who was driving the car, was detained but later released.

 The mishap occurred because of rash driving. It could have been averted if the vehicles were being driven slower, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 According to police, the stretch between College More in Sector V and the New Town crossing has become accident-prone for want of speed bumps.

 Visual reminiscences

 A journalist and prose writer of considerable eminence, Souren Mitra has always displayed a tremendous urge for painting. A meditative observer in the midst of nature, his works clearly portray his passion for art as an intensely personal, creative medium of expression. The ongoing maiden solo exhibition of his paintings reflects his belief that art is essentially visual reminiscing. Nature is the main inspiration behind his paintings, whether they convey venomous emotion or pure pleasure. His images succeed in arresting memories that lie forgotten in the hidden depths of the mind, carrying them to the surface of our consciousness with all nuances of sadness and pathos. They also carry the suggestion of halcyon beauty, long-lost love or deep-rooted agony. The curious interplay of line and colour in his paintings acts as a tool to help reconstruct and refresh lost memories.

 lEvent: Paintings by Souren Mitra lWhen: Till May 31; 3.30 pm - 7.30 pm lWhere: Gallery Katayun, 4A Auckland Square, Flat 21

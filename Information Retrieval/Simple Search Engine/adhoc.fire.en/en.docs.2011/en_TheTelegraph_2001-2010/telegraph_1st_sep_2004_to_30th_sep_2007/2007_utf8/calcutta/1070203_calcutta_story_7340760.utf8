 Look east for education

 SINGAPORES TOURISM ECONOMY, MULTI-ETHNIC CROWD AND MULTITUDE OF COURSES PULL IN OVERSEAS STUDENTS, SAYS BRINDA SARKAR

 Taking the Boards this March? Interested in pursuing higher studies abroad? An increasing number of Indian students are now looking East, instead of West, for taking up educational courses in a multi-cultural environment. And topping their destination chart is Singapore.

 With the University of New South Wales (UNSW) opening its first offshore campus in Singapore, opportunities seem aplenty in the region. Almost a quarter of our UNSW students in Australia are from other countries, with a large proportion of them coming from Asia, said Greg Whittred, president of the institute. Our Asia campus should draw in many more students from the region, the professor added.

 UNSW Asia, Singapores first comprehensive international university, will begin its first academic term next month, offering undergraduate programmes in engineering, science, commerce, international studies, media and design. After the results of the Indian board exams are declared later this year, more students from the country should be joining us in our August intake too, pointed out Whittred. An added advantage for students enrolling in the Singapore campus is the option of transferring to Sydney for part of their degree.

 A number of such foreign institutes, including Indias SP Jain Institute of Management, are setting up campuses in the garden city, thereby making it a regional hub of education. 

 The University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) set shop in Singapore with its bachelors degree in hotel administration and executive Masters degree in hospitality administration last year. 

 Said Andy Nazarechuk, dean of the institute: Tourism has always been an important part of Singapores economy and with the new Integrated Resorts coming up in 2009 there will be tremendous demand for personnel in hotels, public relations, marketing etc.

 The Integrated Resorts is an ambitious new project coming up in the Marina and Sentosa regions of Singapore, according to a spokesperson of the Singapore Tourism Board. Not only will it have new hotels and offices but it will also boast of casinos a first for the island nation. Hospitality courses such as those offered by the UNLV therefore are tentatively equipped to teach everything from information technology in the hospitality industry to principles of casino and gaming management.

 The fee structure of most of the foreign institutes is consciously being kept on a par with that in the main ones. In government colleges, such as the Singapore Management University (SMU), students can earn a tuition grant from the government and also seek scholarship from the individual institutes over and above it. Students who avail of the governments financial assistance, however, have to sign a bond and work for a Singaporean company for three years after graduation.

 Foreign students studying in Singapore have a good word to put in about their college life. Third-year student of SMU Projjal Ghatak, who traces his roots back to a Calcutta school, said: As opposed to the content-heavy education system back home, I find a lot of vibrancy and interaction here. The food is familiar, the multi-ethnic crowd gives us a new perspective and I know, at the back of my mind, that Im only a three-and-a-half hour flight away from home.

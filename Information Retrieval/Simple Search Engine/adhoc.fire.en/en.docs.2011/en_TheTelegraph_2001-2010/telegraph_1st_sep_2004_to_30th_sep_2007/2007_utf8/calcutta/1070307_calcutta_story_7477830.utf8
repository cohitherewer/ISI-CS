 Reliving the Broadway of Calcutta

 Bengali commercial theatre, at this time, is a shadow of its past and gingerly moving towards extinction. Gone are the days when a Sunday matinee show at the Rangmahal was a craze. Most of the city theatre halls have closed down and the towering personalities of the Bengali stage have moved to other pursuits. Theataari... is an attempt to give the kiss of life to theatrepara through performances by theatre stalwarts and eminent film and television personalities. The enigma of long-lost plays like Barbadhu, Shetu, Shaheb Bibi Golaam (a scene from the play appears right) and Lolona, among others, will be woven together by Jagannath Basu and Urmimala Basu, Sudipa Basu, Badsha Maitra, Manoj Mitra, Suchita Raychaudhury, Choiti Ghoshal through readings, interspersed with popular drama songs by Anandee Basu. Concept and direction: Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee. 

 Event: Readings from popular, long-lost Bengali plays accompanied by theatre songs When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Sandhyatara, Star Theatre

Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi on Friday expressed concern over the increase in human trafficking and asked the city police to swing into action against it.

 In his speech during the inauguration of the renovated Calcutta police museum on APC Road, Gandhi said: You can send a message to the rest of the country and the world by preventing trafficking.

 A fortnight ago, the chief minister had expressed similar concern over the rise in human trafficking while inaugurating an anti-trafficking unit at the Bhabani Bhavan headquarters of the Criminal Investigation Department. 

 Gandhi said he was impressed after a short tour of the museum. 

 The items displayed are simple. You will not find too much of text. But the museum will give you an idea of Calcutta polices history quickly and the exhibits will leave an impression on your mind, he said.

 Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee said: The arms and ammunition seized by the British police from freedom fighters are displayed at the museum.

 The governor also launched a book Origin of Calcutta Police, written by P.T. Nair on the occasion.

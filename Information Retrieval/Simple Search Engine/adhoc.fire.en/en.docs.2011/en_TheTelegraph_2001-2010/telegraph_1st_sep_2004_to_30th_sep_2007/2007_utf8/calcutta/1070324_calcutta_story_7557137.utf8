The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tough talk on minority school nod

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state government will violate a central act if it fails to decide on an application for a no-objection certificate (NOC) for setting up a minority school within 90 days.

 This was pointed out on Friday by Justice M.S.A. Siddiqui, chairman of the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions, who is in town with two other members to probe alleged harassment faced by Christian schools in the state.

 Sources in the state education department admitted that several applications for the NOC have been pending for more than three months.

 The National Commission for Minority Educational Institution Act clearly states that NOCs or affiliations have to be granted to minority schools within three months of submission of the application, said Justice Siddiqui.

 And if the NOC is denied on unjustified grounds, the commission is empowered to issue a certificate on its own. A school can approach any board or council for affiliation with the commission certificate, he added.

 Submit your application and wait for 90 days. Let us know immediately if the state government fails to meet the deadline, asserted Justice Siddiqui, at a meeting with the representatives of more than 80 Christian bodies at Don Bosco, Park Circus.

 When contacted by Metro, school education minister Partha De said he was unaware of any such deadline, as mentioned by the commission chairman. The state government delays the process of issuing the NOC only when there is a valid ground.

 The certificate will not be issued unless the government is convinced about certain points, including constitution of the managing committee and the staff recruitment procedure, he clarified.

 Justice Siddiqui, however, made it clear that the commission would act tough if a minority school is found compromising on the quality of education. Academic excellence will have to be maintained by every minority school. Not a single institution will be allowed to exploit the act and compromise on the quality of education.

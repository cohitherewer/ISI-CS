 Horror and haunting

 Symbolising an important facet of the growing cultural relations between the European Union and India, the ongoing 12th European Union Film Festival comprises a bouquet of prestigious, award-winning films from the various member states of the Union. Today, the concluding day of the festival, features Summer with the Ghosts (dir: Bernd Neuburger, Austria; 1.45 pm) and The Death of Mr Lazarescu (dir: Cristi Puiu, Romania; 4.45 pm). The former is about the adventures of a boy and a girl who spend the summer with an elderly special-effects man and a troupe of eccentric ghosts. The latter (a scene from the film appears right) unfolds the crisis and confusion following the sudden illness of its eponymous protagonist. When Mr Lazarescu, a lonely widower, is taken ill, paramedics and neighbours who come to help, decide to take him to the hospital. However, what looked like a simple formality at first, turns into a terrible nightmare.

 Event: 12th European Union Film Festival 2007 When: Till today; 1.45 pm and 4.45 pm Where: Nandan

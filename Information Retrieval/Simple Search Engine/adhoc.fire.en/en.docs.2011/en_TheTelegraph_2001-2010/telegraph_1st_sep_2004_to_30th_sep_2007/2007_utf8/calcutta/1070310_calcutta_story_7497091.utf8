 Counsel concern 

 Amrita used to feel overwhelmed by parental pressure to perform well. Sayans teenage tantrums had become unmanageable, while Rajashree would cry incessantly at school for no reason. But they are fighting to come back on track with the support of family, friends and school.

 Students of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Ballygunge, have overcome psychological disturbance with the help of their school. Though counselling is done in many schools and in other branches of Kendriya Vidyalaya, our school places great importance to students mental well-being, said RS Sharma, principal of the school. 

 The principal started the initiative in 2002 to help the students. Now they feel comfortable to come up to us and discuss matters that they would otherwise hide even from parents, said Arundhati Roy Chowdhury, a teacher who helps in the counselling process. Students are either counselled in a group or alone depending on the seriousness of the problem.

 Rajashree Banerjee enjoyed school when she joined in Class I. But when she came back to school after vacations, her problem began to surface. Rajashree would cry the whole day. Instead of washing its hands off the matter, the school came forward to help her. It undertook parental counselling while also treating Rajashree. She has improved a lot, now, said her father.

Presently, it is the teachers who do the counselling. Four of our teachers work with the students. But I am planning to get a professional counsellor soon, informed the principal.

 Teachers in all classes keep an eye on students behavioural patterns. A class teacher of standard X, who refused to give her name, recalls helping one of her students overcome bouts of depression. She sought attention by saying negative things about herself and would often go into phases of depression, said the teacher. 

 It was the teacher who stepped in to take control of the situation. The girls parents were also counselled and the familys problems sorted out. She is in Class XI now and has improved a lot, said the teacher.

 All kinds of disorganised behaviour is treated in the school. Nothing is brushed aside as too trivial. Samarpita Chakravorty of Kasba was very mischievous. It started when she was in Class IV. She would lie and even bite her friends, said her father. Worries started brewing between Samarpitas parents. 

 But the school authorities decided to counsel her parents and the student to solve the problem. Instead of chastising the children, we prefer to talk to them and understand the reason behind the problems. If there is any family trouble we also take that into consideration, said Sharma. 

 The teachers have also received complaints of sexual assault within the family. I decided to have a drop-box where students can give problems anonymously. I have letters where students have asked questions we would not even think of, said Roy Chowdhury. 

 We are thankful to the school for its effort. They not only counsel the parents and the students but also help children understand that a transparent relationship with parents fosters a healthy life, said Sharmistha Maiti, a guardian.

 Recognising text images

 Abhijit Gupta

 OCR, here we come! The expanded version is quite a mouthful optical character recognition and is the name given to all computer software capable of converting images of handwritten or printed text into a machine-readable format. Ok, now that we are done with the official definition, let us try to properly explain what OCR means.

 Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts will remember a story called The Red-Headed League in which the hapless protagonist is hired to copy out the entire Encyclopaedia Britannica, by hand. Nowadays such a task will be given to a scanner, who will scan each page and record them as a file. Ordinarily, the scanner treats every frame as an image and records them as such that is, an image file. It is nothing more that a collection of black and white or colour dots, technically known as a raster image.

 This is all very well if you only want to look at the page. But if you want to make changes say, increase the font size, or alter spellings you need software which will allow you to analyse the images. You will also need OCR if you want to search the document. Let us say you have a humongous legal document where you want to search the number of times a certain word occurs. Ordinarily, such searches would take hours or days but can be now achieved in a matter of seconds.

 But things become really interesting when it comes to recognising handwriting. While OCR of Roman script is largely a solved problem, this is not so with cursive handwriting and older forms of printing. It is even less so with Indic languages. Many of us use programmes which allow us to write text or send e-mails in Bengali or Hindi. But none of these programmes can perform the task of OCR software. This means that many of the tasks which we now take for granted in Roman scripts cannot be performed in Bengali or Devnagari.

 Last month, the School of Cultural Texts and Records at Jadavpur University held a wide-ranging conference on digitisation, electronic editing, and the challenge of devising a reliable and accurate OCR for Indic languages. The key word is of course accurate any OCR which is 99 per cent accurate is in fact unusable for any kind of serious use. The previous paragraph in this column contained 527 characters, counting the spaces. This means that there will be at least five errors in it if scanned by 99 per cent accurate-OCR.

 Most Indic languages have a large number of letters, conjoints and modifiers so that the task of devising OCR becomes even more challenging. But if the Jadavpur conference is any indicator of the shape of things to come, then it will not be long before we will have our very own Project Gutenberg in Bengali.

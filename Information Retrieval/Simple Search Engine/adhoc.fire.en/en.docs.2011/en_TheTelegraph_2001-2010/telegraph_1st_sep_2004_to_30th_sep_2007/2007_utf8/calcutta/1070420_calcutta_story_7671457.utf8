 Clear the air; heres how

 Todays question: What should the government do to check Calcuttas pollution?

 Stop that: A bus belches dark fumes on a city street 

 Arindam Basu,

 Address not given

 The government should adopt the Singapore model. In Bangkok, the odd and even-numbered cars are not allowed to move on the same day. For example, if on Mondays, the odd-numbered cars are out, on Tuesdays it will be the even-numbered cars plying. Use of CNG in buses and autos is also a good alternative. Engines with Euro II specifications in buses can also check pollution. 

A.S. Mehta, 

 New Alipore

 The government should at once ban all smoke-belching vehicles and autorickshaws. Nearly 75 per cent of the air pollution is due to the vehicles and autos run on condemned engines. The government should introduce autorickshaws and buses run on CNG. More and more trees should be planted to restore the citys green cover.

 Indrani Ganguly, 

 Ho Chi Minh Sarani

 Awareness is the key to controlling pollution. We must educate people. The state should adopt alternative fuel like CNG. Smoke-belching buses and unlicenced autos are the main causes of pollution. Regarding long term measures, a rapid transit system like elevated high-speed tram or rail is a must. Polluting factories should be relocated on the city fringes. More trees should be planted to restore the green cover.

Dinabandhu Mukherji,

 Behala 

 Tree-cutting should be stopped at once. Trees help in keeping the air clean. Use of alternative fuel for vehicles should be encouraged. Environment-friendly vehicles like trams, Metro Rail and trains can also bring down the pollution level. 

Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum Park

 The best way to control pollution is to fine the smoke-belching vehicles. Planting trees and introducing green fuel are good alternatives, too.

Anil Kumar,

 Ramachandra Lane

 The government should run an awareness campaign to control pollution. Newspaper, television, radio and internet are effective media to propagate the idea. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia

 Planting trees is the best way to reduce the pollution level. Roadside trees and shrubs are good purifiers. Besides, old buses and autorickshaws should be banned. 

Biswajyoti Bagchi, 

 Alipore

 Unlicensed autorickshaws and buses should be banned to control air pollution. The government should spread awareness about polluting agents and how to maintain the ecological balance. 

S.M. Sen,

 Sarat Chatterjee Lane

 The government should make stringent laws to control pollution. Factories producing harmful pollutants should be shut down. Old buses should be dumped for new CNG ones.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Held for runway robbery

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four contract labourers, working on the extension of the secondary runway at Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport, were arrested on Tuesday night for stealing cables of the runway visual range (RVR) equipment.

 Sristi Sardar, Ajay Sarkar, Gopal Mondal and Ranjit Oraon were caught while trying to steal 30 metres of cable, worth over Rs 9,000, following a complaint lodged by officials of the airport Met department, said a police officer. Ajay Mondal, an accomplice of the accused, is absconding.

 The four were booked under sections 379 and 411 of the Indian Penal Code, pertaining to theft and receiving stolen property. The cables were part of the RVR equipment, which is a vital component of the Category II Instrumental Landing System (ILS) being installed at the airport.

 Thefts have gone up in the past few months. Even with closed-circuit cameras installed at both terminals, it is not possible to keep a watch over the entire airport, said an official.

 On Tuesday, around 3pm, labourers working with the four saw them carrying away the cables. They reported the matter to the authorities. The Met office, off the runway, was alerted. The four labourers were detained by Central Industrial Security Force for questioning. They were later arrested by airport police.

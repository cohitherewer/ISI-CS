 Power-saver lamps to cut civic street light bill

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The civic authorities have decided to use power-saving, compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) as street lights on an experimental basis in the Sealdah area. 

 Initially, incandescent lamps or bulbs will be replaced with CFLs in narrow lanes .

 It has been estimated that if 40 per cent of the street lamps are replaced with CFLs, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will save around Rs 8 crore as power bill annually. If the additional cost of fitting CFLs is taken into account, the net saving will be to the tune of Rs 6.5 crore.

 Unlike the regular incandescent lamps, power-saver lamps come with a years warranty, pointed out mayoral council member (lighting) Sushil Sharma.

 An incandescent lamp, on the other hand, hardly lasts six months. That is another reason for our decision to switch to CFLs on a limited scale. If the lamps prove effective, we will think of introducing them across the city, Sharma added.

 Civic chief engineer (lighting) Pradipjyoti Biswas, however, stressed that the brightness of the CFLs needs to be verified first. 

 If necessary, we can hold a meeting with the manufacturers and give them our specification before making a bulk purchase, said mayoral council member Sharma.

 The civic body procures three lakh electric lamps halogen, tube and bulb every year to light the streets. Biswas said the CMC shells out more than Rs 30 crore every year to foot power bill for street lighting alone. There are 1.26 lakh lamp posts in the city. Of late, power expenses have been a major headache of the civic authorities. The CMC has to pay Rs 120 crore annually as power bill from its own coffers. Earlier, the state government used to pay the power bill for the CMC.

 We think we can achieve economy in power bill through rational utilisation of power, said Sharma.

 The City Diary

 A fire broke out in a six-storeyed building at Golaghata, off VIP Road, on Monday morning. The blaze gutted the entire fourth floor, but no injuries were reported because there are no residences on that floor. Eight fire tenders took an hour to douse the flames. 

 quot;We noticed the flames on the fourth floor of Ganga Jamuna building, commonly known as Nut-Khut building after a restaurant it housed. We informed police and the fire brigade. The firemen reached the spot within half an hour, said Dinesh Jain, a resident of VIP Tower, an adjacent building. Residents of the area said there had been two more fires in the building in the past two months. 

 Firemen claimed the oil stored in one of the rooms might have helped the blaze to spread. It seems that an electrical short-circuit ignited the oil stocked in the room. We can pinpoint the exact cause only after an investigation, said Bibhas Guha, divisional fire officer.

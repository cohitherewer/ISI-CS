 An existential identity

 Born in Paris in 1956 of parents from Guadeloupe, the Antillean identity is very strong in the writings of acclaimed author Gisle Pineau, particularly in oral tellings, tales and specific history. The trauma of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade and the 1928 cyclone, among others, strongly influence Pineaus novels.They are all linked with the Antilles in some way; a specific situation, that she describes as a post-colonial wreckage of racism, sexism, and the challenge of socio-economic and political instability, characterise her writings. Themes of alienation, exile and insecurity of a Guadeloupean cultural identity, plagued by natural disaster, racism and sexism, dominate her novels, often symbolised through figurations of abuse, sexual abuse and incest. A displaced woman herself, Pineaus works depict women, often struggling in an unstable environment, trying to define themselves. Her protagonists are always in search of an elusive identity, of home, loss and recovery. She is presently in the city to discuss these topics, that are sadly, relevant to our time. She will participate in a discussion and interactive session with students of Comparative Literature Department, Jadavpur University; tomorrow at 3 pm. The author will also meet students on March 28 at Calcutta University at 2 pm. Hosted by The French Association and French Embassy in India.

 Event: Lecture, discussion and interactive session with French author Gisle Pineau

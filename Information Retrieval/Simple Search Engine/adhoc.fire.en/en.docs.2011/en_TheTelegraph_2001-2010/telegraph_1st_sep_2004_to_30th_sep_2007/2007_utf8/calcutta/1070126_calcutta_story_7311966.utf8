The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Demolish squad in Tiljala

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The civic building department on Thursday demolished the third floor of the illegal building at 50 Kustia Road.

 Concrete casting of the floor was in progress on Monday morning when an iron rod fell on 18-year-old Munna Pandey and pierced his skull. The Class XII student of National High School, Hazra, died in Peerless Hospital on Tuesday.

 Local residents had staged a series of protests on Wednesday demanding a crackdown on illegal construction.

 Officials of the building department have demolished the third floor, where piling was going on, said officer-in-charge of Tiljala police station Swapan Pal.

 Metro carried a report on Thursday of how local CPM leaders and police had decided at a meeting in the police station to allow construction of the top floor in the name of compensating Pandeys family. 

 Civic officials asked me about the meeting. I told them that police had no role to play. If they want to demolish the building, we will provide men so that the work can be carried out, added Pal.

 The CPM leaders on Thursday requested the civic officials not to demolish the entire building, as the six families staying on the first and second floors would be rendered homeless.

 It will be difficult to demolish the entire structure because of local resistance, admitted a building department official.

 Love conquers parental hostility

 - Port Blair girl wins bail, walks out of court with man she wants to marry

 A moment from Saathiya, where Rani and Viveik face parental opposition

 After a day of despair, the power of love triumphed over parental opposition. With the judge in Barrackpore granting her bail plea, Roshni (name changed) walked free with the man she loves on Tuesday afternoon.

 The 20-year-old girl from Port Blair paid the price for going against her parents wishes and was detained at Calcutta airport on Monday. Her father had filed a complaint that she had fled home after stealing cash and jewellery.

 Roshni had to spend the night in the airport police station, but as nothing was recovered from her, she got bail from the additional chief judicial magistrates (ACJM) court in Barrackpore.

 The girl told police that her parents were opposed to her choice a 25-year-old Shipping Corporation of India contractor and were determined to marry her off to someone else. Running away from home was the only option, she reportedly told the cops.

 On Tuesday, Roshnis mother appealed to the magistrate to allow her to take her daughter back home. I asked my client whether she was ready to return home but she refused, Krishnendu Sarkar, defence lawyer, told the court.

 The court observed that since Roshni was an adult, it could not interfere with her personal life and left the choice to her. 

 Roshni, in a yellow salwar suit, emerged from the court with her suitable boy, who looked relaxed as he escorted her out and drove her away.

 Their freedom ride has just one rider Roshni must appear on April 10 before a local court in the Aberdeen police station area in Port Blair.

 Its clear that her parents did all that (slap charges against her) to try and stop her from marrying the man she loves, smiled a cop, enjoying the happy ending to a dramatic tale.

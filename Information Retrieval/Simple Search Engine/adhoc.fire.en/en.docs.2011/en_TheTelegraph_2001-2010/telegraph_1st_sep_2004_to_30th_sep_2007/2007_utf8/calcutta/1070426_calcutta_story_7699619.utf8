The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 you share your bday with...

 Mousumi Chatterjee

 You are honest, wise and sober. You are cautious in everything you do and achieve your goals due to your determination and persistence. You are usually lonely at heart and seldom share your secrets. You are happiest with a partner who is mature and knows his mind.

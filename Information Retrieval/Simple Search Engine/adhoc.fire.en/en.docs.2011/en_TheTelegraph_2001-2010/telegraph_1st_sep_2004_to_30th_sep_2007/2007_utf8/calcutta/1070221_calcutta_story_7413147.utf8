 Fair car park woes clog Bypass

 An ill-lit parking lot is forcing several Book Fair visitors to park their cars on roads, causing snarls on EM Bypass and the arteries leading to it.

 Worse, no solution is in sight as the Publishers and Booksellers Guild, organisers of the fair, and police are passing the buck to each other over the responsibility of lighting up the car park at the sprawling Subhas Sarobar.

 Wary of parking their cars in the dark, most visitors are leaving them on the roads leading to Yuva Bharati Krirangan, the fair venue.

 On Sunday, when the fair witnessed a footfall of 85,000, both Calcutta Police and cops from North 24-Parganas had a trying time controlling traffic on the Bypass and its adjoining roads.

 Officers fear the situation would worsen in the next few days. The combined load of the Book Fair-bound vehicles and the usual weekday traffic would make certain stretches of Maniktala Main Road and Beleghata Main Road difficult to negotiate, said an officer of the Sealdah traffic guard.

 This would not have been the case if bulk of the Book Fair-bound cars could be parked at Subhas Sarobar. But most visitors prefer not to leave their cars in the ill-lit Sarobar, the officer added.

 It was decided at a meeting between the organisers, police and a few government departments that the Guild would light up the car park, but that has not happened, said a senior officer.

 The situation is forcing visitors to park their vehicles on roads meant to be free of any clutter, causing snarls in several areas, said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (traffic).

 Guild officials, however, insist that lighting up Subhas Sarobar is not their concern.

 The Guild is not responsible for the parking lot. The problem has to be sorted out by police, said Guild general secretary Tridib Chatterjee. Even when the fair was held on the Maidan, the Guild was not responsible for car parking.

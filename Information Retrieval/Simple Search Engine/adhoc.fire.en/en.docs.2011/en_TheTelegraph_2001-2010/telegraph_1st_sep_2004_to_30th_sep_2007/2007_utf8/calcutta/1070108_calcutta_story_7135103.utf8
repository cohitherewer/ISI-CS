 A musical fountain executed by the south Calcutta firm

 From setting up the worlds largest musical fountain at the upcoming Gujarat Science City to holding a water screen laser and projection show at Sofitel Vinpearl Resort and Spa in Vietnam, Premier Irrigation Equipment has made water dance to its command. 

 The 40-year-old firm, based in Boral, south Calcutta, started out as manufacturers of irrigation equipment, like sprinklers and pipes, before graduating to making musical fountains, water screen laser and video projection software and virtual ride simulators. Till date, it has completed a series of projects in China, Hungary, Indonesia, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Syria, Ukraine, the UK and the US, apart from India.

 One of the first projects that garnered attention for Premier was the set-up of Fountain Park in Jamshedpur in 1966. Senior general manager of the company R. Mukherjee confessed that he had doubts about the size of the market when the musical fountain arm was launched in 1989. Musical fountains have proved to be major revenue-earners. Today, a show-controller software has made operation procedures simple, one-switch affairs, he said. The first musical fountain project was funded by the CESC on the Maidan in 1990.

 In Chennai, a set of fountains installed by Premier is frequently used as backdrop for film shoots. The Volcano restaurant in Syria is a local landmark, thanks to the artificial volcano installed by the company. The man-made 40-50 ft hill with a crater has a giant water screen on which appear projected images of volcanic eruption accompanied by sound effects.

 The Dome of Delight is a luminous dome of mist-like spray that changes colour every minute. The light emitting diode bulbs produce the basic colours red, green and blue. But they can combine to form 16 million chromatic variations, explained senior manager Saibal Bhaumik.

 The Magic Cloud produces mesmerising colours and fluid shapes. The sparkling Water Tubes, also on show, amaze in their semblance to static metal poles that rise and arc in air. 

 Premier now has 29 branch offices and two factories, apart from the one at Boral, which has a display area for clients.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The heat is on in the gaming ring

 The counter-terrorist had spotted the bomb planted in his path at the last moment. By the time he defused it, the terrorist had lobbed a smoke grenade and sped off. After yet another chase around alley corners, up steep walls and down underground tunnels, he levelled his machine gun for a headshot. Time in hand: Fraction of a millisecond.

 This was no counter-insurgency operation in action at Klub Pezo on Short Street. But the intensity among the Counter Strike 1.6 players was no less. The arsenal was deadly and a moments lapse would wipe off ones existence. On-line, that is.

 Sifys Animax Grand Gaming Challenge 07 had brought the citys gaming enthusiasts out of the holes to face top guns from five other cities in the East.

 This is the first time that a tournament of this scale is happening here, said Naved Khurasi, who is coordinating the regional finals for entertainment giants Sify.

 The Counter Strike crown went to a team from Cuttack called Eco after a pitched five-a-side crossfire for 45 minutes in which they demolished the Calcutta representatives by 13-0.

 Vivek Raj, a Class VIII student from Jamshedpur, was savouring the fight from the sidelines. One must play online to improve skills. One gets to learn new tricks facing strangers, said the boy who invests Rs 40 every week for two hours in a local game room.

 Playing online has its hazards. The more distant your rival is, the greater is the latency (gaming working speed), slowing the registration of the opponents moves. Though geographical location cant be made out, a latency of 150-170 usually indicates a player in Calcutta while 300 could mean Delhi or Bangalore. I have played even at a latency of 1,000 where I couldnt even make out when I got hit and when spawned. It was bizarre, laughed 15-year-old Anand Alda of Jamshedpur. 

 Calcutta fought back in the other games D.O.T.A., Gunz Online, FIFA and Need for Speed UG2 (racing). The team will represent the east in the finals in Mumbai on February 28.

 The East is lagging in gaming, where the West rules, followed by the South, Khurasi said, adding it was more due to lack of interest of companies rather than gamers. We had about 400 registrations from the city, with the eastern zone tally being around 2,000.

 Compare that to 5,000 entries in the west zone with 2,000 from Mumbai alone! The competition will be tough in the finals but Khurasi has his hopes high for the FIFA winner, 18-year-old Subhodip Nath of Khardah. 

 Check him out. He is special, he smiled.

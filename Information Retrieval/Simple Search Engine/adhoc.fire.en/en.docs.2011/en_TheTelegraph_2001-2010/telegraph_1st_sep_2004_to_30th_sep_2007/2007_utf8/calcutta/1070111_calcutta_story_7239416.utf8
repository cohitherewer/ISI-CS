 In one of the biggest investments in the private healthcare sector, the AMRI group is setting up two new hospitals in south Calcutta.

 Nearly Rs 150 crore will be spent on a multi-speciality clinic adjacent to the existing AMRI hospital at Dhakuria. Also on the anvil is a paediatric and women-care hospital at Mukundapur, off EM Bypass.

 The Bypass project will cost about Rs 110 crore, while the tab for the Dhakuria project is expected to be in the region of Rs 40 crore.

 The Wockhardt group has started building a Rs 110-crore hospital in the Mukundapur area. A 17-cottah plot has been acquired adjacent to the existing hospital for setting up a 100-bed clinic. Construction will begin soon, said S.K. Todi, director of the AMRI group.

 The seven-storeyed new facility will have super-speciality gastroenterology, haematology and nuclear medicine units over 40,000 sq ft. Officials said the haematology unit will have a thalassaemia detection and treatment section and an onco-haematology department for critical patients. 

 The new clinic will boost the bed strength of the hospitals facilities in the area to nearly 700. We are planning to instal equipment for image-guided radio therapy, stated a hospital official. 

 There are plans to renovate the existing hospital. Treatment facility in urology will be introduced in the wing. AMRI has tied up with RG Stone Urological Research Institute, New Delhi, to upgrade the infrastructure. Holmium laser, lithotripsy and other non-invasive methods of treating kidney stones and prostrate problems may also be offered.

 Hospital officials say ayurveda and psychiatry clinics will be set up at the nursing training institute at Dhakuria.

 Work on the 300-bed women and paediatric care hospital at Mukundapur is also expected to start soon. The hospital will be built on a 100-cottah plot covering 180,000 sq ft. The design has been finalised. Two towers, connected by a corridor, will be set up, said D.N. Agarwal, adviser, AMRI Hospitals.

 A large section of the citys population is now shifting to areas along EM Bypass. The hospital will cater to these people, pointed out Agarwal. 

 One of the towers will house the child-care super speciality wing with paediatric cardiology, psychology, neurology, orthopaedics and other units. It will also have diagnostic facilities. Hospital sources said there may be a tie-up with a foreign hospital chain to provide the most modern care to newborns and train mothers on childcare.

 Wockhardts 380-bed hospital will have super speciality units in gastroenterology, cardiology, urology and oncology. The first phase will be operational by the end of 2007, said Rupali Basu, general manager, Wockhardt Hospitals, Calcutta.

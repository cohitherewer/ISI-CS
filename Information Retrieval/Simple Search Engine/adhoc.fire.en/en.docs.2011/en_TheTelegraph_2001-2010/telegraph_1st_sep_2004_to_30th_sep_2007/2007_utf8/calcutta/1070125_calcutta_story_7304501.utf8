 A thought for food

 Stay on the move between your 

 table and the buffet at the new multi-cuisine food stop 

 at The Kenilworth. What used to be the Crystal coffee shop 

 and restaurant at the hotel on Little Russell Street has 

 been transformed into Aroma, the new cafe, restaurant and 

 grill.

 Step past the reception area and 

 take a right into the 64-seater, 1,450-sq-ft space, which 

 has been tastefully furnished with red and beige leather 

 chairs and a few lounge-style nooks, all set on shining 

 black floors. Strong beige pillars, panelled walls, white 

 blinds, glass doors, woodwork and matching table runners 

 give the coffee shop a chic look. With a glass wall on one 

 side, customers can enjoy the beauty of the lush green lawn 

 on the southern side of the coffee shop.

 We have recently renovated 

 our rooms and thought of a coffee shop to go along with 

 it. From the lobby or from the lawn side, one gets the feeling 

 of an open-air space, says R.S. Singh, vice president, 

 operations, The Kenilworth Group of Hotels.

 And open it is. A few lazy chairs 

 with green leather backs are strewn across the lawn outside 

 for those who prefer the natural look. Sunlight streams 

 in from the wooden panelled covering and broad tree trunks 

 are placed a few feet apart. To add to the ambience, strings 

 of small round mirrors hang from the ceiling.

 Even the menu is brand new. The 

 focus is on Continental cuisine, but the kitchen also serves 

 up Indian and Chinese dishes, both a la carte and on the 

 buffet. Live omelette and pasta counters and a barbecue 

 on the lawn provides the perfect ambience for a sizzling 

 meal, says Singh.

 The best deal for food lovers 

 is the buffet spread. Lunch is served between 12.30 pm and 

 3 pm and the first order for dinner is taken at 7.30 pm. 

 The buffet lunch and dinner will concentrate on the 

 combo-meal, keeping in mind the preferences of the present 

 generation. A special breakfast buffet between 7 am and 

 10 am will also be provided, said Indrajit Roy, executive 

 chef, The Kenilworth. 

 The morning buffet is priced at 

 Rs 300 plus taxes and the lunch and dinner buffet comes 

 for Rs 550 plus taxes. Beverages include a wide range of 

 mocktails, cocktails, spirits, wine and, of course, coffee. 

 The price of a combo-meal (Rs 450) from the menu is close 

 to the price of the buffet, to encourage customers 

 to focus on the spread.

 Start with soups like Tomato and 

 Basil Soup, Asparagus Soup, Mulligatawny Soup (delicious 

 lentil soup laced with coconut milk with curry leaves) and 

 an array of vegetarian and non-vegetarian salads like Couscous 

 Royale (warm couscous salad enhanced with Moroccan spices) 

 or Tangy Seafood Salad. The international spread on Aromas 

 menu includes Fish Chips, Grilled Tenderloin 

 Steak and Savoury Crepes. The Indian and Oriental section 

 offers Malabar Prawn Curry, Lamb Rogan Josh, Dum Ka Paneer, 

 Hunan Chicken in Honey Sauce and Szechwan Prawns, all served 

 with bread or rice. 

 For dessert, there is Chocolate 

 Mud Pie, Blueberry Cheesecake, Kulfi Falooda and Cold Coffee 

 with Ice-cream. And for chocoholics, theres a Chocolate 

 Counter with imported flavoured chocolates along with Tiramisu 

 and Cheese Biscuits to dig into.

 The customers can also try their 

 hand at personalising their own meals, by making their own 

 sandwiches and pastas. 

 Weekends are special. Live 

 violin performances on Saturday and Sunday and a special 

 Sunday brunch that comes with unlimited beer is an attraction 

 not many will miss, smiles Singh.

 The restaurant is open from 7 

 am to midnight. The coffee culture is picking up. 

 Our in-house guests can come here late at night. This will 

 be a second home to almost 40 per cent of our regular clients, 

 feels Singh.

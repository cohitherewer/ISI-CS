 They are as comfortable in water as they are on land after spending more time swimming in the rivers across the country than in their homes in Hooghly for the past 10 years.

 After four feats in a decade, 30-year-old Kamal Chakraborty and 34-year-old Arup Chakraborty, who made it to the Limca Book of Records in 1997, have now completed their longest and toughest journey. They started on March 13 in Koteshwar, Kutch, and swam and walked along the coast across 5,227 km to Calcutta exactly four months later.

 The two travelled through nine states and 15 rivers, including the Sabarmati, Mahi, Narmada, Godavari, Cauvery, Krishna, Mahananda, Subarnarekha and the Hooghly. They travelled by day, putting in at least 12 hours of walking and swimming before stopping for the night.

 The duo survived on soups and juices, having a solid meal only at night. We decided to be on a liquid diet because sitting down to eat would have meant wasting a lot of time, said Kamal.

 We had been planning the expedition for seven years. We knew it would be expensive, so we were saving up, he added.

 Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyays novel Chander Pahar first planted the seeds of wanderlust in Kamals mind. A keen swimmer since childhood, he teamed up with Arup for their first journey from Hardwar to Diamond Harbour. Kamal had not yet entered college.

 The passion for swimming brought us together. I had approached a lot of friends to undertake expeditions with me. Many of them agreed but backed out after hearing stories of the dangers they might encounter. Only Arup kept his word, said Kamal.

 The two have swam in the Narmada, Godavari and the Brahmaputra, but agree that the recent journey was the toughest. We had a lot of trouble swimming in the Subarnarekha because it was monsoon and the river was overflowing. There were large stretches of land that were totally uninhabited, said Kamal. He hopes that the journey will find a mention in the Guinness Book of World Records.

 The friends are now looking forward to a new trip. We would not mind swimming the English Channel and back in one go. But that will be possible only if we manage to find sponsors, said Kamal.

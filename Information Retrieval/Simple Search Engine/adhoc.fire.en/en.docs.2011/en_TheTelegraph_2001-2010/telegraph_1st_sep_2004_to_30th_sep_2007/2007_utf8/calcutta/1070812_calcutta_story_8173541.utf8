 The gym way to ageing

Ageing is tricky. The first 25 years of my life I was impatient to grow up. To me, older people always seemed to be having more fun, more freedom and more choices. Once I reached 25, my enthusiasm to grow older ebbed considerably and when I reached my 30s, even more.

 Wanting to grow up fast and then wanting to remain young forever seem to me a constant struggle that we are engaged in. And nowhere is this battle more apparent than where I live now the US. 

 As I got acclimatised to American television which itself took a long time I noted huge differences with Indian programming. One big one was the advertising that targeted older people, senior citizens, grandmothers and grandfathers. From erectile dysfunction drugs that enhance sex life to anti-ageing creams, botox, bladder control medication, hiding your greys, the range is endless. Prime-time programming is overflowing with many such temptations; all you have to do is switch on your TV and then dial a 1-800 toll-free number.

 A society for all ages is the call of the United Nations. The organisation says that individuals are living longer than ever before 20 years now added to average life-expectancy, due to improved health, hygiene and nutrition. And with this demographic revolution, the world is changing.

 Getting old, or older, is a fascinating business in the US. Gyms are filled with men and women in their 50s, 60s, 70s and even 80s on elliptical machines and treadmills. Some of them look good, others just tired, but they come day in and day out to these temples of fitness.

 They push weights, jump up and down in aerobic classes and are the front-rowers even in the dance classes, from tap to belly dancing. Nor do they claim be doing this merely to stay healthy and fit. They want to look good, thin, toned and attractive and are up front about it.

 Looking good is not only a matter of pride but a way of life. My 68-year-old neighbour a lovely American woman and mother of two adult working sons puts on her foundation, eye-shadow, blusher and lipstick, even as she walks the dog on a Saturday morning. Her blonde hair, without a trace of grey, is always blow-dried and intact.

 She looks ready to meet the world all the time and in the past three years that I have lived next to her, I have never seen her any different. I have to admit she looks great as she greets me with her dog, come rain or shine or snowy wintry mornings. Initially I used to wonder, where is she headed, for a brunch party? But now I am wiser, she is just out for a stroll. 

 Every day, on the commuter trains as I head to work at 8am, I see older women making themselves pretty without a care in the world. In India, it seemed to me, always awkward, embarrassing even, to check yourself in a small mirror, or God forbid, put on lipstick in public. A sign of vanity, many staring eyes would silently signal to me.

 But on the trains and buses heading into New York City, women of all ages take out their make-up bags and promptly start working on the canvas of their faces without a second thought. Often, they spend all of the one hour to work, working on their faces.

 Its fascinating if you can peep into their make-up bags and see the range of products they carry for their morning routines, from under-eye foundation to wrinkles reducing creams to mascara, et al.

 At another level, its liberating, almost one feminist step forward, seeing women so totally uncensored and unconcerned about public reaction. And its not as if these women have too much time on their hands they are hard-working, middle-class American women. 

 Critics will scream deliberate commercialisation is the root of all this. Others will say these are luxuries of the rich and select few.

 But what I notice is also an attitude. While men and women endeavour to hold on to their youth, their looks, their bodies and energies in the US, they are not embarrassed or ashamed to do so, in contrast to the East. They are blatant about it, and far from self-conscious about their gym memberships or salon appointments, or bright red lipsticks. Their efforts to stay young or look good are never hampered by attitude or shame. 

 And it makes me wonder, is that really so wrong? If you are living longer, why not look good while doing so?

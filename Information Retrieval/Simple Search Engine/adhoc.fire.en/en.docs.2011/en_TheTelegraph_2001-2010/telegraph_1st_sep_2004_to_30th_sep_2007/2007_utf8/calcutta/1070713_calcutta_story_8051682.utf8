 The recent murder in a Howrah hotel has prompted police to issue a list of guidelines for the owners of all hotels and lodges in the town.

 At a meeting in the office of the superintendent of police on Thursday, the owners were asked to install closed-circuit cameras in the reception areas. The footage will help us identify criminals, said an officer.

 The owners were also asked to take down the full addresses and phone numbers of customers and to verify whether the numbers were genuine. Besides, the owners must make it a point to check the rooms before allowing customers to leave at odd hours and should be extra careful while letting out rooms to young couples.

 The meeting follows a murder at Chandraloke Hotel, on Hari Mohan Bose Road, early on July 9. On July 8, three persons had booked a room in the hotel around 8.45pm. They identified themselves as Ashok Ghosh, 42, Asim Ghosh, 38, and Ajit Ghosh, 35.

 Early next morning, two of them woke up the owner of the hotel and requested him to open the gate, as they wanted to take a holy dip in the Hooghly.

 When they failed to return even at night, the owner called Golabari police station. The cops broke open the room door and found the third man murdered.

 The sleuths have drawn sketches of the two alleged killers based on the descriptions provided by the Chandraloke Hotel owner.

 The sketches and the photograph of the victim have been sent to the Criminal Investigation Department.

 At the meeting in the police superintendents office, some of the owners, however, demurred over the proposal to install closed-circuit cameras. The owners said the cameras are too costly, but we did not buy the argument. The gadgets are well within their reach, said Milan Kanta Das, the additional superintendent of police (town).

 The owners relented after we convinced them that the cameras would help prevent crime, which is giving a bad name to all hotels in the town. They must realise that they need to cooperate with us for the sake of their business, he added.

 Arun Kapoor, the owner of Ashoka Hotel, who attended the meeting, said: I think the police have given us good suggestions. I shall follow them as far as possible. But the owners of small hotels and lodges will not be able to afford closed-circuit cameras.

 Wheres the knife, my lord?

 - X-ray image of scamster stomach fails to show weapon he swallowed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 KNIFEMAN: Amarendra Nath Ghosh

 The X-ray plate of Amarendra Nath Ghosh the city scamster accused of a series of bank frauds amounting to Rs 27.69 crore shows no trace of the 10cm knife he had swallowed three years ago in Germany to avoid extradition.

 After Ghosh underwent a single-view X-ray at MR Bangur Hospital, the jail doctor reported that there was no foreign body in the abdomen of the accused.

 The CBIs special court, where Ghosh was produced on Tuesday, directed the CBI to get another X-ray done and submit the report on September 13. The X-ray conducted by MR Bangur Hospital could not confirm the presence of the knife in the stomach. The court has asked us to conduct a second X-ray from another reputed hospital or nursing home, said a CBI official.

 The court also rejected the bail petition of Ghosh, who was lodged in Presidency jail, and remanded him in CBI custody till the next hearing.

 Ghosh was brought to Delhi from Munich last month by a team of CBI officials, two surgeons and an anaesthetist, equipped with medicines and surgical equipment, on a special aircraft. The German authorities had ordered Ghoshs extradition in April 2003. He approached the constitutional courts against it and when his pleas failed, he swallowed a knife and refused to undergo surgery, delaying his extradition. The German authorities finally handed him over to the CBI and he was flown to India in an air ambulance.

 What explains the mystery of the missing knife? The answer could lie in the single-view X-ray of Ghoshs abdomen conducted at MR Bangur. A single-view X-ray is often not confirmatory as another angle might provide a different picture. So a multiple-view X-ray should show where the knife is lodged, said Bijon Kundu, a radiologist at Eco Diagnostic Centre.

 Ghosh had earlier claimed that he had no problems living with a knife inside his abdomen. I know how to live with the knife. I can take it out whenever I want to by performing a set of asanas, the former resident of Kasba had said when he was produced before the CBIs special court in end-August, soon after arriving from Munich.

 So was it asana time before X-ray time, Mr Knifeman?

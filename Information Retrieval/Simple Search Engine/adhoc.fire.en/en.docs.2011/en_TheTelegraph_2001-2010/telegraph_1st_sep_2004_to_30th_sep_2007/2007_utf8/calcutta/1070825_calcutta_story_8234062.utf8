 On August 9 and 10 the Science City auditorium was buzzing with music, masti and lot of activities. More than 950 students from around 113 city schools gathered there for the fourth Horlicks Wiz Kids 2007. The inter-school fest is one of the most popular events in the country. 

 Different activities and competitions like antakshari, face-painting, sudoku, group dance were organised at this two-day fest. Wiz Kids is a good platform for creative and talented teenagers, said Shahla Jahan of St Augustines Day School. 

 Every school was given about a months time to prepare from among as many as 40 activities. The registration starts two days before the fest. 

 The event also supported social campaigns like Ban the bulb by Greenpeace, which was a part of Horlicks Wiz Kids and encouraged students to take up such social issues. 

 The fiesta came to an end with two city kids emerging winners in the Calcutta chapter. Nusrat Jahan of Bhawanipore Gujarati Education Society School and Nelabro Chatterjee of Don Bosco, Liluah will represent the city in the national finals in November 2007 in Bangalore. The national winners will then represent the country in this years grand finale that will take place in Brazil. 

 More than 2,50,000 students participated this year from over 1,650 schools across 27 cities in India.

 Get the policies right

 Is your neighbourhood stinking of garbage? Do your streets get water-logged after heavy downpour? What about social problem like child labour? 

The Project Citizen workshop, organised by Lakshmipat Singhania Academy (LSA), (picture left) identified the problems and tried to find out their solutions. Teachers and students from different city schools came together in brainstorming sessions in this three-day workshop that started on August 20, to formulate policies and even involve the administration to chart out a simple solution path.

 We started off this innovative workshop two years ago and teachers from more than a dozen city schools participated this year. The response was overwhelming, said Meena Kak, principal, LSA. 

 The project is also planning to involve schools from other parts of eastern India to carry forward and diversify the actions, she added. 

 Groups of students work together to identify a public policy problem in the community. They also research on that particular issue and try to evaluate alternative solutions. They develop their own solution in the form of a public policy and create a political action plan to enlist local or state authorities to adopt the proposal. This years participants developed a portfolio of their work. Students will present their project in a hearing showcase before a panel of administrative people, later this year, informed Pushpa Dayani, a Project Citizen trainer.

 Project Citizen aims at actively engaging students in learning how to monitor and influence public policy. In the process they will be better citizens of tomorrow, said Kak.

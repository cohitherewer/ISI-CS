The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Women are still missing

 It came to the forefront, perhaps, with Renu Roy being elected the vice-president of Saturday Club. Her winning the election, ironically, shed light not on how women have entered club culture, but how they are absent. Most clubs have over the years changed their rules to extend membership to women, but few of women avail of the facilities. Are clubs in Calcutta then among the last true male bastions?

 The scene is ambiguous at Saturday Club. Membership is allowed to both sexes. But the number of individual women members is not available. This is because irrespective of whether a man or a woman approaches for a membership, the spouse also becomes a member in his or her own right, and is not counted a dependant member.

 There are widows and unmarried women, too, who are members of Saturday Club. I have never faced a discrimination of any kind at Saturday Club, says Roy. Women need to come forward more. And once people realise that they are in no way less deserving than the men, I am sure they will be accepted. For me its only a matter of time before that happens.

 Women are being taken in as members at Tollygunge Club for a long time. The club has a system of Single Lady Members through which single ladies are taken in. It has now become more of a category for widows of ex-members. Women are also allowed as general members.

 For example, Rita Bhimani is a member of the club, while Kishore Bhimani is a dependent member, by virtue of his wifes membership. Women also enjoy the power of voting. Yet, women members constitute only five per cent of the total membership. And they have never been part of the general committee of the club or held an office of power. They have been part of sub-committees like the entertainment committee. 

 The 215-year-old CCFC opened membership for women in 2001, yet only 28 of its 1,500 members are women. One criterion for membership is financial independence. CEO Deepankar Nandi says housewives may be members if the husband is ready to pay the bills, but admits that they prefer financially independent women. Bengal Club said that it allows women members in their own right. 

 The situation is more relaxed at the new clubs. Women have always been allowed as members of Princeton Club in their own right. Housewives are also allowed, if the husband is willing to foot the bills. It has 15-20 women members. I think clubbing has traditionally been more of a male prerogative since the man would be the earning member. And that mindset has continued, says P.S. Rawat, CEO, Princeton Club.

 Calcuta Club is the only club in the city that still does not allow women members.

 Sambaran Banerjee

 Former Bengal captain and national selector 

 Sourav Ganguly was and is a class player. No one else made those 10,000 One-Day International runs and 22 centuries for him. What these 10 months outside Team India have done is boost his focus and commitment to the game. That shows in his body language. As for his technique, his footwork has returned to what it was in 2001-2002 when he was at his best. The level of confidence he exudes today on the 22-yard pitch is the direct result of the jolt he received at being left out. So it can be said that the break was a blessing in disguise. Why talk only of Sourav? Zaheer Khan has returned a transformed player. His control over the delivery is much better.

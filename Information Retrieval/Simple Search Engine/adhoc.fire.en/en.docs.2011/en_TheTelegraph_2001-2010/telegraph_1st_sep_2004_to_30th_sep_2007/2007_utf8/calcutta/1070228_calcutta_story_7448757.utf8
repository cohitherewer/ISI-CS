 Air tie-up on Dhaka route

 A STAFF REPORTER

Indian airlines has temporarily withdrawn its aircraft on the Calcutta-Dhaka route and entered into an arrangement with GMG Airlines.

 According to the agreement, passengers buying Indian tickets on the Calcutta-Dhaka sector will fly on a GMG craft.

 We decided on the arrangement due to operational reasons. The move is on a temporary basis, said an Indian spokesperson.

 The airline used to operate two flights a week to Dhaka. Biman Bangladesh operates three daily flights, while GMG has daily flights. On Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, it operates two flights.

 Air-India operates three flights from Dhaka to Calcutta, which proceed to London.

 The agreement has come into effect from today. We are expecting 15 per cent passenger growth due to this, said a GMG spokesperson. 

 The Dhaka-based carrier started its Calcutta operations in 2004 with an MD Boeing 82 aircraft with a capacity of 150 passengers. Indian used to operate an Airbus 320, with the same capacity.

 As part of the agreement, Indian will revive its presence on the Calcutta-Chittagong sector with a GMG aircraft that flies on the route thrice a week. 

 According to aviation industry insiders, shortage of aircraft and the need to cut costs has prompted the Indian move.

 Jet Airways and Air Sahara are planning to launch Calcutta-Dhaka services soon.

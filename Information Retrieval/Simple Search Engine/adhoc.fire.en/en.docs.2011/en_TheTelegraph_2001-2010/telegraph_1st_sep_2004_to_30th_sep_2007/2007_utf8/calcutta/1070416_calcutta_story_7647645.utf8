 Schools signal steep fee hike to stay afloat

 MITA MUKHERJEE

A steep hike in tuition and other fees is on the cards in Anglo-Indian and Christian missionary schools in the city and elsewhere in the state.

 According to an initial estimate, the hike in the tuition fee will not be less than Rs 120 a month, while in some schools, it could be as high as Rs 350.

 The move is being seen as a fallout of a state government announcement that threatens to deal a blow to the schools finances. 

 In the 2007-08 state budget, finance minister Asim Dasgupta had announced that 50 per cent of the dearness allowance (DA) of the teachers and other employees of the schools would be merged with the basic salary. 

 This implies that the government grant for the salary only the DA component will come down from 74 per cent to 24 per cent of the basic, said Father M. DCosta, headmaster of St Aloysius School, a member of the Association of Christian Schools.

 The merger will lead to a substantial increase in the salary of the employees. 

 And the cut in DA means that the 700-odd missionary and Anglo-Indian schools, which receive only the allowance part of the salary from the government, will have to cough up more from their coffers to pay the extra remuneration. This has prompted the schools to contemplate a hike in the fees. 

 According to state government rules, all aided private and minority institutions have to pay salaries to their teachers and non-teaching employees on a par with government schools.

 Following the merger of the basic salary and part of the DA, the net salary of the teachers in the aided schools will increase by Rs 2,500 to Rs 7,000 a month.

 The fee hike is inevitable if the government goes ahead with its plan, pointed out Father DCosta.

 Terence Ireland, principal of St James School, said: Our expenditure will increase considerably if we are to implement the revised pay-scale, as suggested by the government. We will decide on the hike once the government issues the notification. 

 Worried with the situation, the heads of all missionary and Anglo-Indian schools met in the city last week and decided to inform the parents about the possibility of a steep hike in fees.

 The process of the merger of DA and the basic pay has not yet been notified and the formula is yet to be worked out, but we expect a substantial increase in the basic pay and other allowances, resulting in an increased burden on the schools. To meet the additional liability, we need to revise the fee structure, read a letter issued by Carmel High School to the guardians.

 The hike, according to the principal of a prominent south Calcutta institution, will vary from school to school, depending on the number of students. The hike will be more in schools with fewer students.

 State school education minister Partha De said he would talk to the finance department about the problems being faced by the missionary and Anglo-Indian schools.

 There had been a substantial rise in the fees of these schools in 2002, after the state government had slashed the DA from 132 per cent to 41 per cent of the basic pay. It was later raised to 74 per cent.

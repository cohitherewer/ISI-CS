 New Years gift for village kids

 Fresh start: Inauguration ceremony of Rasulpur Primary School on December 31

 There was just half a day left for 2007 to set in and the city was gearing up for night-long celebrations. That was when a team of young entrepreneurs and corporate executives set out for the countryside to see another of their dreams come true in Rasulpur, a village in Hooghly district, 50 km from Calcutta.

 Each of them, members of the Calcutta chapters of Round Table India (RTI) and Ladies Circle India, had made several trips to Rasulpur before to monitor the revamp of Rasulpur Primary School. 

 The work was part of RTIs Freedom through Education project, which was started in 1999 with the aim to benefit a million children by 2008 through development of the infrastructure in government primary schools in rural areas across the country. So far, 4,200 classrooms in 1,000 schools, including 30 in Bengal, have been rebuilt using Rs 75 crore. In the coming year, 10 schools will be rebuilt under the scheme.

 On the morning of December 31, Rasulpur Primary School wore a festive look. The children rushed forward to shower flowers on the guests. The classrooms, two on the ground floor and a hall on the first floor, smelt of fresh paint. The floor had been cemented and the tables and chairs had been given a coat of varnish.

 Tabler Stephen Lord from Round Table Britain-Ireland, and his wife, Circler Maxine Lord, opened the school, along with Tablers from Calcutta Hiten Mehta and Rajesh Agarwal, and Circler Sonali Gupta.

 Till six months ago, the school didnt have any amenities. It was a small, single-storeyed structure, comprising only a room, with a tiled roof, since 1979. 

 The villagers are mostly daily-wagers in the fields. The children dont even get one full meal a day. During winter, they come to school on an empty stomach, shivering. The school building could not keep out the sun, rain or cold. Why would they want to come here? asked headmaster Satya Charan Koley.

 Thats when RTI stepped in. The reconstruction of the school had a budget of Rs 7 lakh. While Calcutta Metropolitan Round Table No. 41 and the RTI AGM Committee contributed two-third of the cost, the rest was borne by the school itself.

 The school has 86 students on its rolls. I liked my school, but now I like it more. It is bigger, smiled Anjuma of Class III. Yasim of Class IV said shyly: I want to study and get a job.

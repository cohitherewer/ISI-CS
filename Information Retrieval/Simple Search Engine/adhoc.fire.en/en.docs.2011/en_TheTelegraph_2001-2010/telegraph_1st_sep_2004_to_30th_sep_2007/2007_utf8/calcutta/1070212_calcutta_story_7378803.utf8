 Pre-season sting control 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Unlike in previous years, parts of Calcutta have been in the grip of mosquito menace since January-end.

 Reviewing the situation, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has decided to immediately launch a vector-control programme, which is usually undertaken from May.

 According to civic vector control officers, the mosquito-affected areas include Cossipore, Chitpur, South Sinthee, Dhakuria, Tollygunge, Prince Anwar Shah Road, Golf Green, Lake Gardens and some pockets on the eastern fringes, where big construction projects are being taken up.

 We have carried out field tests and the mosquitoes in these areas have been found to be of the Culex variety, not the ones that cause malaria and dengue. Still, we are not taking any chance and the vector-control wing has been asked to launch an anti-larva drive right now, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 Chief municipal health officer Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay attributed the untimely spurt in the mosquito population to the sudden rise in the minimum temperature after January 25.

 Forty-odd malaria cases were reported to the civic clinics over the past week. There has, however, been no dengue case.

 The civic health department is considering more stringent measures against the owners of premises where mosquito larvae are being found.

 We will paste notices on the walls of the houses where larvae will be found, so neighbours can have an idea about the source of mosquitoes in their localities, mayoral council member (health) Subodh De said.

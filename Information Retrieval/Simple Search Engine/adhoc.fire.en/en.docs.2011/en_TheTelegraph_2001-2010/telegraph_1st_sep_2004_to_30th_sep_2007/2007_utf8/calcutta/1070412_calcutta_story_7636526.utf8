 The Jadavpur University (JU) vice-chancellor and registrar met the chief minister at Writers Buildings on Wednesday to apprise him of the state of affairs on the campus. 

 Vice-chancellor Shyamal Kanti Sanyal and registrar Rajat Kumar Bandyopadhyay narrated the incidents of violence at JU on April 5 to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. They also informed him that a committee would be formed within the next two days to probe the incidents.

 According to university officials, the chief minister expressed concern about the ransacking of the JU Karmachari Sansad office and science club on April 5. He directed the vice-chancellor to ensure that the incidents were probed immediately.

 We discussed the modalities of the probe with the chief minister. He told us that since we are an autonomous body, we should decide on our own about whom to entrust with the inquiry, the vice-chancellor said after the meeting. 

 Members of the Sansad meanwhile continued their indefinite ceasework. Classrooms, libraries and laboratories remained shut at JU forcing teachers, especially those of the engineering and technology faculty, to hold classes on the corridor, in the staircases and in the lawn. 

 Copies of the letter written by Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi urging members of the Sansad to call off their ceasework has been circulated among the organisations members, said a university official.

 On Wednesday evening, the three students unions of the university held a press conference on the campus and condemned the incidents of April 5. They demanded immediate measures to restore normalcy on the campus.

 The students expressed their fears of campus placements being hampered due to the strike.

 We had tried to reason with the Sansad members, but they did not cooperate, said Amit Chakraborty, general secretary of Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union.

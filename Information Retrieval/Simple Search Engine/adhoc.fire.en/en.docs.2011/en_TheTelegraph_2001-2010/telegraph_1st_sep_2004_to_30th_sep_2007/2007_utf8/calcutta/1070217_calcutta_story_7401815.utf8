 Project to wipe out monsoon misery

 - ADB funds to tackle waterlogging 

With funds from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP) has taken up a programme to free the city of waterlogging. 

 Projects worth Rs 280 crore will be taken up under the programme to tackle chronic waterlogging in Boroughs I and XII. The areas in Borough I that will benefit include Cossipore, Sinthee, Chitpur, Rajpara, Satpukur, Paikpara, Tallah, Belgachhia and Dutta Bagan. They are spread over 8.32 sq km.

 In Borough XII, Garfa, Santoshpur, Jadavpur, Kasba, Haltu, VIP Nagar, Purbalok, Tagore Park, Mukundapur and New Garia, spread across 13.23 sq km, will be covered. 

 Five pumping stations will be set up in Borough I, while five existing ones will either be augmented or renovated by the CEIP. Borough XII will get four new pumping stations. 

 We are working quickly so that people can be provided relief at the earliest. Waterlogging is an acute problem in some parts of the city. Every monsoon brings misery, said Rajiva Sinha, director of the project. Sinha added that pipes are currently being laid for the work. The project is expected to be completed by December 2009.

 The CEIP is also clearing a number of canals to improve drainage, as part of the ADB-funded programme. Eleven km of Chowbhaga canal, five km of Monikhali (canal) from Thakurpukur to Shampa Mirza Nagar, 1.5 km of Keorapukur canal and 2.1 km of Charial canal (extension) will be dredged. 

 We decided on clearing the canals a year ago. But the work got pushed back due to delay in rehabilitation of families living along the canal banks and sanction of funds by the Centre for the project, explained Sinha. 

 According to him, the work cannot be completed by the CEIP on its own. For example, we will finish pipe lying in Borough XI within one-and-a-half months, but if Tollys Nullah, into which the pipes empty, is not dredged by then, the people will not reap the benefits. 

 The irrigation department is hopeful of completing cleaning of Tollys Nullah within two months. Chief engineer of the department Goutam Chatterjee promised to hand over the canal to CEIP by beginning of April.

 We have to work with Metro Railway, which has not handed over several sites to us, claimed Chatterjee.

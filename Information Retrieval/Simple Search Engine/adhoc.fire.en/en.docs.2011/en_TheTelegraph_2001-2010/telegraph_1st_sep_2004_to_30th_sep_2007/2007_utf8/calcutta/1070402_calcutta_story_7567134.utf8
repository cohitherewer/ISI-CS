 Disappointed with the men in blue, cricket-crazy Calcuttans have shifted loyalty to the boys in green. 

 Despite Saturdays 10-wicket rout at the hands of the Aussies, there is no missing the rising wave of support in Calcutta for Team Bangladesh responsible for Indias ignominious exit from World Cup 2007 . 

 And the traders at BC Roy Market, better known as Maidan Market, are cashing in on the new-found love for our neighbour.

 It is surprising that people are asking for Bangladeshi flags and jerseys, said Milon of Milon Sports. To cater to the unexpected demand, Milon has got in touch with his suppliers and stocked the 10ft-by-six ft shop with Bangladeshi greens.

 You cannot compare it with the sale of Indian jerseys, but the demand is significant, added the man in his mid-20s. 

 From linguistic likeness to admiration for a band of young boys support for Bangladesh has various reasons.

 They cannot make it to the semi-finals, but we still support them because of the effort they had put in as a team on the field, said Sougata Dey, senior associate, Siemens Information Systems Limited.

 The Bangladesh team with an average age of 20-something acquired Test-playing status from the International Cricket Council after beating Pakistan in the 1999 World Cup. The giant-felling spree continued with Australia in 2005 and India last month.

 I am supporting Bangladesh I could have cheered for Sri Lanka, but I connect with Bangladesh more, said businessman Deepankar Ghosh, who spent some time on Free School Street mini Dhaka in Calcutta on Saturday night, cheering for the green brigade. 

 Its true that they were no match for the mighty Australians, but they have won my heart, summed up Ghosh.

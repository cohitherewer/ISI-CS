 The Sothebys auction held in New York on Tuesday in support of the Kolkata Museum of Modern Art (KMOMA) has already raked in $1.5 million. As results continue to come in, it is expected to gross close to $2 million. KMOMA aims to be the citys first museum of contemporary Indian art.

 It is no surprise that Rameswar Brootas 60x60 work, an oil on canvas which resembles a monumental X-ray and was estimated to fetch $120,000-180,000, is the highest grosser, collecting $300,000. Broota, born in 1941, is today in the same bracket as Tyeb Mehta and M.F. Husain.

 Arpita Singh has drawn $204,000, nearly double the estimated price of $100,000-150,000. Those who follow her career graph know that she is the leading lady of the Indian contemporary art scene.

 But the success of the some young artists and folk and tribal artists from Bengal and Madhya Pradesh has come as a surprise. Bhuri Bai has gained $5,040 against the estimate of $1,000-2,000. Even Swarna Chitrakar, from a Bengal village, went for $3,900 against the estimate of $1,000-2,000.

 Of the young artists making waves at the Sothebys auction are Chintan Upadhyay (born 1972), who at $31,200 scored almost 10 times the estimated $3,500-4,500 and Subodh Gupta at $78,000.

 Pushpamala fetched $12,000 for her Phantom Lady series of photographs in which she herself strikes poses. Her estimated price was $1,200-1,800. So, Pushpamala is now in the same bracket as Dayanita Singh.

 Of the Calcutta artists, Ganesh Pyne went under the hammer for $42,000 and $84,000 while Jogen Chowdhury went for $48,000. However, two well-known Bengal artists who have died recently sprang a surprise. A dry pastel by Bikash Bhattacharjee was bought for $51,000, and a Somnath Hore sculpture fetched $40,800.

 Rakhi Sarkar, the managing trustee of KMOMA, said from New York over the telephone that all expectations have been fulfilled. It was off-season so we did not expect this kind of success.

 Although no work by M.F. Husain was on display the master himself was present at the sale.

 Sarkar said 30 per cent of the total funds will be provided by the state government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The state government has already allotted 10 acres at Rajarhat for the museum. The culture ministry at the Centre has greenlighted grants and now it is being processed.

 There will be tie-ups will all public sector museums and certainly with the National Gallery of Museum of Modern Art, a sister concern.

 Architects are being screened now and the feedback is positive, said Sarkar. The names of Frank Gehry and Herzog amp; de Meuron are being considered for the Rs 500-crore museum. The names of some architects from Japan and South Africa have also come up.

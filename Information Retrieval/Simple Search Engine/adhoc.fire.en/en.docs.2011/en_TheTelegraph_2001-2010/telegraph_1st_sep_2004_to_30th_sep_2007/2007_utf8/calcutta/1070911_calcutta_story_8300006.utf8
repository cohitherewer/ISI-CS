 Merc man goes into reverse gear

 Peter Kells, the Mercedes man, finds Calcutta unchanged apart from the flyovers and perhaps a million more people. He is revisiting the city where he was born after more than four decades. And its pretty much the same, says the sexagenarian, who lived on Syed Amir Ali Avenue in the 1940-50s. 

 The DaimlerChrysler project manager is still on familiar terms with ground realities. He could find his way from Park Circus to Park Street. Flurys and Trincas are still there but not Firpos. It was burnt down, I hear, says the British honcho, who ate the Indian curry five times a week.

 Kellss father, George Edward, came to India in 1933 to work for CESC as a store manager and served the company for 30 years. It was while he worked at the CESC headquarters in Cossipore that Peter was born in 1941. 

 Edward wasnt too keen on the lavish colonial lifestyle that his European peers enjoyed in India. Though we did have a cook, a jamadar, two ayahs and a driver, we were pretty much brought up on middle-class values and tied our own shoelaces and did our own chores. 

 However, Kellss mother belonged to the upper class English aristocracy whom Edward met in Calcutta. She would never like me mingling with the native kids, reminiscences Kells. While she would be away for a game of bridge or to a kitty party Kells would come out on the road to play with his Indian friends. I was very much a gutter kid. 

 Peter wanted to time his visit with the kite playing festival but was early by about a week. But he had his day with kites on the Maidan. We flew kites from the gullies and thats tougher than flying them from terraces, he said. 

 My father sent me back to England after my initial schooling at St Xaviers in Calcutta. The first couple of years back in England were horrible. I was immediately labelled an English Indian who was brown from a tan and spoke Indian English. 

 After school, Peter chose to work in Calcutta with Chartered Bank but went back again to study. He returned after more than four decades to work for DaimlerChrysler, India and has been posted in Pune since last year. That gives me a chance to visit my birthplace as often as I want.

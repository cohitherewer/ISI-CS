 A perfect tribute

 Known for his serene and contemplative abstract paintings and sculptural pieces in ceramics and pottery, artist Badhan Das was at heart a social activist, who tried to preserve, revive and encourage the folk culture of the Santhals of Santiniketan. His belief in human emotions was shaken by war, rebellion and insurgency during the days of his youth. Thus his early works were primarily figurative and narrative in nature, with a focus on the reformatory role of art. In later life, he became more of an individualist, and his art gradually turned non-figurative and introspective. His last works were almost in monochrome and seemed to underline a quest for a new reality. On Their Own, the ongoing exhibition of abstract paintings by veteran and contemporary artists, pays tribute to the master artist-activist. Participating artists: M.F. Husain (a painting by him appears above), S.H. Raza, Ram Kumar, Amitava Das, Mona Rai, Sunil De, Amitava Dhar, Yogendra Tripathi, Samindranath Majumdar and Partha Shaw.

 MLAs men dodge murder chargesheet

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 The Jhas of Kidderpore have requested police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee to direct his force to arrest two youths allegedly involved in their eldest sons murder in October last year.

 Bikram, 20, was killed following a dispute with members of Adi Shakti Club, of which local Congress MLA Ram Pyare Ram was president, over Kali puja subscription.

 The Jhas, residents of Karl Marx Sarani, had lodged an FIR against four persons, of whom two were arrested. 

 The other two, Bhola and Dipu, are at large and reportedly pressuring the family to withdraw the case.

 Not only have officers of South Port police station failed to arrest the two in the past four-and-a-half months, they have even dropped their names from the final chargesheet, filed a fortnight ago, complained Bikrams father Dhaneswar, an employee of the Nepalese consulate.

 In his letter to the police chief, he has written: The two have been roaming free in the area. Police, hand-in-glove with them, have not done anything so far. I request you to transfer the case from South Port police station to the detective department.

 Officer-in-charge of South Port police station J. Dhole said the names of Bhola and Dipu were dropped from the chargesheet because no evidence could be found against them. Jha, however, alleged the MLAs support is enabling them to move around scot free.

 Sitting at home, he mumbled: Bhola and Dipu have been terrorising me and my family. They have threatened to kill me if I dont withdraw the FIR. We have reported the matter to South Port police station, but the officers there have not taken any action.

 Vikrams mother alleged: Police and politicians are providing all help to the killers. We are living in a jungle raj.

 Deputy commissioner (port) Rajiv Mishra promised to look into the matter, while MLA Ram refused to comment. I have distanced myself from the club after the incident. You ask police why they are not doing their job, Ram added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The man who is a bookshop

 Calcuttan Of The Week 

 Tarun Shaw. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta 

 Name: Tarun Shaw, a.k.a. Tarunda

 Profession: Bookseller 

 USP: This tall and sturdy man in his early 40s (picture by Bishwarup Datta), with a smile that refuses to vanish, has a dedicated following in several offices. He is a mobile bookstore. In busy offices Tarunda has access to 300 firms, including big media houses he will walk up to an employee, write down the name of the book, the publisher and promise to get back. Which he will, often with good news, be it Playboys best short stories or Derrida or Harpers Bazaar. Or the latest Nobel or Booker winner. Old customers often find it difficult to pay him, as Tarunda forgets whats his due. But he insists he doesnt make losses. 

 Modus operandi: At any given time he carries about 25 kg of printed material on him. The books fill up two paper cartons loaded on to the side of his motorcycle. He starts out at 11 every morning and gets back home at nine. Nearly two decades have passed since he took charge of his fathers business after graduating from City College. 

 Famous clients: Rituparno Ghosh, Sanjiv Goenka, Derek OBrien, Agnimitra Paul and Harsh Neotia.

 Whats in store? Tarunda stocks more than 800 books subject wise at his SN Banerjee Road home. Sourced from distributors in Calcutta, New Delhi and Mumbai and international agents in the UK and the US, he keeps both fiction and non-fiction, mainly in English. Apart from news magazines like Economist, Time and Newsweek, his collection of fashion and art journals include Harpers Bazaar, Cosmopolitan, Vogue, Galleries and Art News. Tarunda takes pride in supplying copies of international dailies such as Los Angeles Times, New York Times and The Daily Telegraph to many subscribers every day. 

 Management mantra: I keep a list of email addresses of agents and publishing houses in the UK and the US, printed on the back cover of books, to import titles that are difficult to obtain, says the bookseller. He often recommends a book to its right reader. I love reading and it helps me stay well informed about the books I keep. I also try and assess the taste of my clients. He makes time to go through the blurb of each book. I check the reviews in newspapers and keep track of the literary prizes.

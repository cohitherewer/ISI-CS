 With police turning down repeated pleas for a fresh post-mortem on Satyabrata Dutta, his family performed the last rites on Thursday. Satyabrata, a third-year medical student, who was found dead on his hostel campus in Bangalore.

 Though Bangalore police had confirmed that Satyabrata, a student of Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre at Whitefield, had committed suicide, his family members alleged that he was murdered and filed a complaint with Titagarh police station, seeking fresh investigation and another round of post-mortem. 

 The officials of Whitefield police station had performed the post-mortem and forensic test. Hence, according to the law, we cannot perform the same here unless we get a magistrates order, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24 Parganas).

 Realising that moving court and seeking the order will take time, the grief-stricken Dutta family cremated their son on Thursday. 

 I still believe that there was some foul play behind the death of my son. But, I am not in a position to move court and travel to Bangalore to obtain a court order for a fresh investigation. In any case, my son is not going to return, said Sukumar Dutta, shaken by the news of his eldest sons death. 

 As Satyabratas body was flown down to Calcutta and then brought to the familys four-storeyed house in Palta, around 30 km from Calcutta, friends and relatives trickled in to be by the side of the Dutta family. 

 He was such a bright studentWe just cannot believe that he is no more, said a neighbour, ruing over the apathy of the local police to probe the case further. 

 Police told us that he had an affair with a girl, who was mentioned in his diaries. But they have not recovered any love letter, said a relative. 

 Police, however, said they were cooperating with the investigating officers of Whitefield police station. 

 We have been told that the post-mortem report indicated that hanging was the main cause behind Satyabratas death Our Bangalore counterparts have also informed us that the boy was suffering from some psychological disorders, said a police official.

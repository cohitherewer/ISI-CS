 Smoke in the eyes 

 Save My Space 

 The slum in Kankurgachhi. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta 

 I live in a house adjacent to the Pantaloons store at Kankurgachhi. The area adjoining the building has been taken over by slum-dwellers, leading to conditions that are difficult to live in. 

 The problem

 Our flat is on the first floor of the five-storey building. We came here 12 years ago. The slum has been there from that time. However, the problem worsened recently when some slum-dwellers started using the main entrance of our building as an extension of their households.

 They burn chullahs every morning between 5.30am and 10am. The fumes get into our flat and create immense discomfort for the family, which includes elderly members.

 Some families from the slum have also started using the gates as open-air bathing place. Their children use the place as a toilet. The gates have been converted into a clothesline. 

 Where to complain

 We have tried a few times to reason with the encroachers, but with little result. Complaints were made to the civic authorities, but nothing came out of it.

 We did not want to talk to the local councillor as instead of providing a solution, this could have irked the slum-dwellers. My mother has recently come back from hospital after a prolonged illness and has to undergo the ordeal 24x7. We dont know whom to turn to and would like to highlight the issue.

 Stat Talk Slums 

 According to UN-Habitat rsquo;s Global Report on Human Settlements 2003, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation area has more than 5,000 slums, registered and unregistered. One out of three Calcuttans lives in a slum. In some wards, more than 90 per cent of the population live in slums, the 2001 census report says.

 Saluting the Sun

 Surya - The Sun God, a dance production by Samskriti Shreyaskar, traces the concept of the sun god as it exists in Hindu mythology and philosophy. The concept thus explored draws on various Sanskrit texts and religious and social practices including the well-known shloka, the Gayatri Mantra. The sun gods consort, Gayatri, is evoked thrice a day: as Brahmarupi in the morning, as Mandhyani in the afternoon, and as Sandhya in the evening.The Surya Namaskar of yoga, with its 12 postures associated with the 12 epithets of the sun, relates breath with movement, life with dance. Usha, the goddess of dawn, is received and welcomed as she announces the arrival of Surya, who rides majestically across the sky, driven by a chariot drawn by seven horses symbolising the seven colours of light. Surya appears, spreading light, warmth and energy; making the body and the spirit throb with life again. Concept and direction: Rani Karnaa.

 Event: Dance-drama Surya The Sun God, presented by Samskritiki Shreyaskar When: Today at 6.45 pm Where: Rabindra Sadan

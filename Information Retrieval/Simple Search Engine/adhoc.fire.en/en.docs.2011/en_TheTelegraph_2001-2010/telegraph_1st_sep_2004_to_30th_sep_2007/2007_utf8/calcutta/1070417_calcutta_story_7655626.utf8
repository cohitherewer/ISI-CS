 Death in shame, says wife

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In the first extensive interrogation session with sleuths of the criminal investigation department (CID), Sutapa Bag broke down and narrated her version of the mysterious twin deaths.

 Sutapa confessed on Monday that she and husband Jayanta decided to kill their nine-year-old daughter Tiyasa and commit suicide after a gang of four youths raided their house and went on the rampage to teach her quack husband a lesson. She also told us that she did not make any effort to save Tiyasa, said a CID official. 

 On April 3, Tiyasa and her father were found dead in their Andul home. The neighbours rushed Sutapa found lying on the floor to Howrah district hospital. 

 As the autopsy surgeon, who conducted post-mortem on Bag, had said that the quack was murdered, Sutapas statements became very crucial in the case. But she had not been cooperating with the sleuths for the past three days. 

 Initially, she told us that she could not recall anything. Then, she held her husband responsible for Tiyasas death, said a CID official. 

 According to the 31-year-old, she and Bag discussed their deaths for over one-and-a-half hours before killing Tiyasa and attempting suicide. 

 She said the attackers shouted in front of neighbours and disclosed their involvement in a pornography racket, which forced them to end their lives, added the official. 

 According to her accounts, Bag brought three surgical knives from his chamber and slit Tiyasas veins. 

 Now, we will have to gather evidence that will corroborate Sutapas statement. She may turn hostile and withdraw her statement during the course of the trial and so we are not taking chances, said the CID official.

 A fire broke out in an incense-stick unit on Canal East Road, in Narkeldanga, on Tuesday afternoon, gutting it in two hours. No one was injured.

 Police said the blaze was doused before it could spread to the adjoining shanties.

 The extent of damage or the cause of the fire are yet to be ascertained. Police said a non-bailable arrest warrant would be issued against the factory-owner, based on a report by the fire brigade.

 The report stated that the factory lacked even the basic fire-fighting arrangements, said an officer of Narkeldanga police station.

 Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee said the fire was noticed around 2 pm. The workers saw smoke billowing from a corner of the premises. The smoke soon turned into a blaze. The 30-odd workers rushed out and informed the fire brigade, he added.

 The entire unit was in flames by the time fire tenders reached the spot. The blaze spread quickly because of the presence of sandalwood dust and resin in the factory. Eight tenders were engaged to douse the blaze. Also, our men had to vacate the shanties, said a fire brigade official.

 Police said the fire could be controlled in a couple of hours because of adequate water in the canal, a few metres from the unit.

 But the smouldering fire in the sandalwood dust will take the entire night to be put out, said a fire department officer.

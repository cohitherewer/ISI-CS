 What: Flavour a Rajasthani and Mughlai food festival, hosted in association with The Telegraph.

 Where: Nalban Boating Complex.

 When: Tuesday and Wednesday evening, 6 pm to 10 pm.

 Big bite: The drizzle on Tuesday night did not dampen the spirits of students, ex-students, professionals and faculty members of Subhas Bose Institute of Hotel Management. Flavour a food festival organised by the institute was inaugurated by celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor.

 The entrance looked grand with strings of lights creating a canopy. Sentinels in traditional Rajasthani attire stood guard near the doorway. The dcor was a perfect picture of a Rajasthani village thatched roofs and archways, bandhni dupattas, dummy camels and wells, hookahs warm colours gave cheer to the chilly night. Even girls dressed as Rajasthani villagers sat huddled with churis display. Food and drink was served in earthen pots and thalis.

 Students put together a cultural performance that included a fashion show and a Rajasthani folk dance. Bangla rock band Kalpurush belted out peppy numbers on centrestage, even as a display of fireworks lit up the sky. 

 Spotted at the food festival was Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen. Im glad that men are taking up cooking with a passion. It will provide relief to the homemaker woman who is always associated with cooking, she said.

 The spread: A wide array of spicy chaats kicked off the food feast. Pure vegetarian Rajasthani cuisine included Stuffed Khandvi (potato dipped in besan batter and fried with Rajasthani spices), Chhota Samosa, Kair Falli, Jodhpuri Mirchi, Kair Sangri ki Sabji, Jodhpuri Gatta, Panchmela Dal, Baree Magree Methi Mix, Gatte Ki Khichdi, Sabji Pulao, Rajasthani Mirchi, Kadai Paneer, Bajre Ki Roti and more. Desserts like Dal ki Halwa, Kesariya Jalebi and Gulab Jamun with Ice-cream added the final touch. For non-vegetarians, there was a Mughlai spread.

 Voiceover: The flavour, culture and colour of Rajasthan is very Indian and even its cuisine has authentic vegetarian dishes. The Mughlai food stalls provide options for non-vegetarians. The students and faculty members have put in a lot of hard work to make this food fest a success, said Sunil Gomes, dean of studies, Subhas Bose Institute of Hotel Management.

 Rice route

 What: Pongal Festival.

 Where: Malgudi Junction.

 When: Till January 21.

 Big bite: The food festival celebrates Pongal, the harvest festival and the Tamil equivalent of Thanksgiving. Pongal means a preparation of milk and rice boiled together and the Camac Street South Indian speciality restaurant will serve up a variety of rice-based dishes straight from the kitchen fire. 

 The spread: Start with Pineapple Rasam (traditional rasam prepared with a hint of sweet pineapple). Move on to main course dishes like Venpongal with Carrot Raita (prepared from rice and moong dal), Vangi Bhaat with Vegetable Raita (pulao accompanied with fried brinjals and curry leaves), Takkal Sadam(tomato rice with khatta meetha chutney), Pulli Sadam (tamarind rice with cucumber raita) and Mint Biryani served with generous helpings of pudina and dhania leaves. 

 To satiate that sweet urge, theres Shakkar Pongal (Pongal prepared from newly harvested rice and creamy milk) and Moong Payesam. 

 Apart from the special spread, the regular South Indian spread will also be served. It includes Curd Rice, Hyderabadi Biryani, Bisibele Bhaat (a khichdi style preparation with a spicy touch) and Rice and Green Dal Pongal.

 Tollywood actor Arjun Chakraborty with his jewellery designer wife Nilanjana and 13-year-old daughter Suhasini dropped in for a taste of the special menu. 

 Pocket pinch: Dishes are priced at Rs 50 each.

 Voiceover: Malgudi Junction is synonymous with South Indian food and the festival of Pongal calls for a special festival to share with the huge South Indian population in Calcutta as they bring in the New Year, said Pankaj Poddar, director.

 Italian array

 What: Cookery workshop at Hyatt Regency, Calcutta. 

 Where: La Cucina, the Italian speciality restaurant.

 When: Wednesday morning. 

 Taste case: The new Italian chef, Mauro Zanusso, presided over the cookery show that stretched over two-and-a-half hours. Moderated by Rita Bhimani, there was hardly a dull moment at the whip-it-up session. 

 The young chef talked about his childhood passion cooking, truffles and more as he dished out delicacies. 

 Participants lapped up the live demonstration of recipes like Pomodroi Ripieni, Pan Fried Raviolo, Pan Fried Seabass with Oven Roasted Root Vegetable and Parsley Foam and Ginger Crme Brule. 

 The session was punctuated by tips from the chef.

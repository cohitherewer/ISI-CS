 Our city, their city: Waterlogging in Calcutta streets (top) finds reflection (and justification!) in Mumbais inundation 

 Assault on doctors by patients relatives leading to disruption of services has become common in government hospitals (Ceasework at hospital, July 6). The strike by junior doctors of Medical College and Hospital following the alleged assault on one of their colleagues is only the latest such incident. Such violence needs to be stopped immediately. 

 The root cause often is lack of infrastructure even in big government hospitals to deal with emergencies. Unfortunately, poor and middle-class people have no option but to approach these hospitals. 

 Generally, patients are brought to hospitals in serious condition. Those accompanying them do not have an idea about the availability of facilities for emergency treatment. When they see their loved ones dying without the most basic treatment, they lose their head and attack the doctors. 

 The government must provide infrastructure to all its hospitals to render emergency services. In the absence of such facilities, serious patients cant be attended to. Neither can they be turned away.

 It appears that the mayor of Calcutta is only interested in what is happening in Mumbai (Mayor points to Mumbai while Calcutta goes under water, July 4). There is nothing wrong about it. We wish that he is quickly elected to the post of Mumbai mayor. 

 Let Calcutta have a mayor who is not as interested in what is happening outside; one who does not point to other cities instead of solving problems. It does not cheer up a dying man to learn that the man in the next hospital bed is also dying.

 It is wrong on the part of the lawyer-mayor to point to Mumbai in defence of atrocious waterlogging in Calcutta. Should we suffer since Mumbai or Bangalore suffers? The mayor has no right to relax on the plea that some other major cities have failed to solve the problem. Rainwater will accumulate on the roads after heavy rain, but why cant it be drained out within a few hours?

 The mayors excuse for waterlogging underscores his incompetence and lack of foresight. Waterlogging has been a problem in Calcutta for a long time. And the mayor has not done anything to improve the situation.

 It is disheartening that without making any effort to desilt the sewage network and overhaul the pumps before monsoon, the mayor is content at pointing to other cities that are perceived to be better. His attempt to defend his boards incompetence failed miserably. It is sad that a city of so many eminent personalities and intellectuals has him as the mayor. With a mayor like this, the chief minister should reconsider the ban on hand-pulled rickshaws, which are of real help on waterlogged streets. 

 Sunil Banerjee, 

 VIP Road 

 While I write this letter, our locality is under water. And heavy rain is not the only reason behind the waterlogging. Two days ago, we spent Rs 1,500 to clean the local sewers. Several hessian sacks were found inside the manholes. Which is not surprising considering the number of illegal settlers in the area. Townships are coming up in several parts of the city flouting every law. Instead of pointing to Mumbai, the mayor should sanction purchase of boats for evacuating people during waterlogging. Maybe he could go on a jaunt to Italy to study modern gondolas before that. After all, the chief minister would need a high quality boat to reach Alimuddin Street from Writers Buildings. 

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed,

 Waterlogging is not new to Calcuttans. What is surprising is that the situation is worsening every year. Flyovers, malls, parking plazas and multiplexes are coming up but even the most basic civic services are absent. The pumping stations inaugurated every other month are useless. And they will continue to be so as long as the canal banks are encroached by those who constitute the vote bank of political parties. If rain for a day reduced the city to this state, god help Calcutta if it faces a natural disaster. 

 Subhankar Mukherjee, 

 Borehat, Burdwan 

 Apropos the report Wet roads to rage, cave-in at airport link, July 6, a 25-ft portion of VIP Road caving in confirms that public servants do not work at all. No doubt that the incessant rain since Monday caused damage to the road but a cave-in is difficult to explain.

 Another star has fallen from the Tollywood firmament (An actor and a gentleman, July 6). Subhendu Chatterjee not only made his presence felt in the midst of Bikash Roy, Kali Banerjee, Anil Chatterjee, Bhanu Bandopadhyay, Anup Kumar, Rabi Ghosh, and Uttam Kumar and Soumitra Chatterjee, but also shone. 

 Kajal Chatterjee, 

 Sodepore 

 Apropos the picture of Neil OBrien being felicitated on July 17, he was felicitated by the rector of Educlinic for his 40 years of contribution to quizzing.

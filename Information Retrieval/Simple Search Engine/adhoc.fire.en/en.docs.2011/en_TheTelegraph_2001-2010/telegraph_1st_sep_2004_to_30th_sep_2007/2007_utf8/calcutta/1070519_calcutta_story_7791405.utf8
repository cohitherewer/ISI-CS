 A different perspective

 Portraying the multi-coloured moods and colours of life, Dimension Four presents Kaleidoscope - 2007, a group exhibition of photographic art. Featuring 10 monochrome and 38 colour prints, the show attempts to convey the dynamism and vitality of our daily lives. Simple, vivid and vibrant, they reflect fascinating, interesting and even intriguing aspects of everyday life that normally eludes our notice, perhaps because they are too familiar to us. The photographs cleverly capture the lyrical qualities of motion, the silent eloquence of portraits and the latent, effervescent energy of still-life; powerful attributes that give fresh meaning and perspective to our prosaic, routine daily activities. Inauguration by Benu Sen this evening at 5.

 Event: A group exhibition of photographic art When: May 19 - 21; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Gaganendra Pradarshashala

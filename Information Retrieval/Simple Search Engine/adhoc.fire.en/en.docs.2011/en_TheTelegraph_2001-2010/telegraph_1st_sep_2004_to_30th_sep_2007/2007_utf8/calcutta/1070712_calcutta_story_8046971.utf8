The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Molested and harassed

 - British couple turned away by police after assault by trio

 A STAFF REPORTER

A British woman in her early 30s was molested and her husband beaten up by three hoodlums near Indian Museum on Monday, the first day of the couples holiday in Calcutta. 

 The tourists were then turned away by a police patrol and Park Street police station and questioned for half an hour at New Market thana before they could lodge a complaint. 

 The couple, identified only as Wilson and Rebecca, were returning to their Sudder Street guest house from Park Street around 9.30pm when the three men on a motorcycle accosted them. They passed lewd comments and molested Rebecca, before snatching her bag, containing two credit cards and Rs 7,000 in Indian currency.

 The trio sped off after beating up Wilson when he tried to resist them. The couple, in a state of shock, sought help from a police patrol. The officers asked them to go to Park Street police station.

 The duty officer there was only interested in finding out where the incident had occurred. The spot was identified and after 15 minutes of questioning, he told the couple that it was outside the police stations area of jurisdiction and they would have to lodge a complaint with New Market thana. 

 The two went there in a taxi and recounted their bitter experience once again. Instead of lodging a complaint, the officers proceeded to question the couple for half an hour. The two could not take it any more and threatened to complain to their superiors. Only then was a diary lodged.

 On Tuesday, Wilson and Rebecca wrote to senior officers, detailing their harassment at the hands of the goons and the police.

 We have started a case. There are gangs operating on Sudder Street that target foreigners, said Samir Gupta, the officer-in-charge of New Market police station, on Wednesday. He denied that the couple had to face any problem in lodging the complaint. 

 Our officers visited the guest house they are staying in but could not find them. It seems they have moved elsewhere, Gupta added.

 According to an officer, the couple arrived in the city from Delhi on Monday afternoon. They had planned to stay here for a week and then go to Puri. 

 Wilson told us he and his wife were returning to the guest house on foot from McDonalds when the three men, who were drunk, stopped them, added the officer.

 A senior officer at Lalbazar said: An inquiry has been ordered against the officer who refused to lodge the complaint.

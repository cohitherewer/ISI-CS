 Landscapes of love

 Tohidul Islams paintings are expressions of his love. The ongoing exhibition of his works bears witness to the fact that he is haunted and enamoured by all things natural. A landscape painter has two objectives: to guide the spectators mind to a faithful conception of the actual natural object and, to impress on the spectators mind the feelings that these very objects inspired in him. Islam does both with admirable ease. Force, dynamism and lyricism are the salient features of his treatment of nature. Mysteries are captured in his paintings done in acrylic on canvas, as individual objects lose their identities within the larger whole. Besides taking exquisite care with his use of colours, Islam uses lighting with cunning perfection to impart a certain eerieness to his compositions.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Tohidul Islam When: Till September 30; 1 pm - 8 pm Where: Gallery Exposure, 54B Mahanirban Road

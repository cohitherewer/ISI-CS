 Sewage bane for buildings

 IMPURE AND UNSAFE: A labourer draws drain water for mixing mortar. Picture by Soumen Bhattacharjee

 A large number of highrises coming up on the citys fringes are not strong enough to survive even a mild earthquake.

 The reason: the promoters are using drain water to prepare mortar for constructing the structures.

 A section of residents alleged that a lack of supervision by the local civic bodies is encouraging the builders to carry on the corrupt practice, rampant in Baguiati, Teghoria, Lake Town and in parts of the Dum Dum and South Dum Dum municipal areas.

 Water used for preparing mortar must conform to certain standards, pointed out Mukul Mitra, a senior civil engineer. For example, it should be free of chlorine and contain minimal iron. Water with mud or other impurities will definitely affect the buildings in the long run.

 Agreed a senior engineer of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation: Water used for mortar should at least be of potable quality. Presence of mud in the water damage the buildings permanently and make them unstable. Such structures can collapse even in a mild quake.

 Why are the municipalities not taking action against the unscrupulous promoters? We will move as soon as we are informed, even over the phone, about the illegal practice. Our officers will conduct raids and take action against the promoters, said Monodip Mukherjee, chief engineer of Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality.

 Justifying the use of drain water for preparing mortar, a Lake Town-based promoter said: We do not have any option other than using muddy or contaminated water, as there is hardly any pond in the locality.

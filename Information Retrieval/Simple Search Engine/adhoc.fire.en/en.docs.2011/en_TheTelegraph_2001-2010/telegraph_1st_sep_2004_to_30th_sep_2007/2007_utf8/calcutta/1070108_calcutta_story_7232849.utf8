 The City Diary

 The army team probing the alleged vandalism by its men at Park Street police station on December 31 night will move the civil court on Monday and seek permission to record the statements of the witnesses. The army had earlier sent letters to the witnesses, requesting them to come to Fort William. But neither did they turn up nor reply to our letter. We will now seek permission from court to record their statements, said an officer.

 Three persons, including an employee of Cossipore Gun and Shell Factory, were arrested on Sunday on charges of cheating a person of around Rs 18 lakh. An officer of Shyampukur police station said the three, along with two others, had taken the money from a man promising him a flat in north Calcutta.

 Three men, in their mid-30s, were killed when the motorcycle they were riding lost control and rammed into an oil tanker in Mahestala, on the southern fringes of the city, on Sunday morning. Police said the youth driving the motorcycle could not see through the fog. The three were taken to a local hospital, where they were pronounced dead.

 A still-born girl was recovered from the vat in Scott Lane, in Muchipara, on Sunday afternoon. Police said local residents informed them that an object wrapped in a white cloth was lying in the vat. A team rushed to the spot and recovered the babys body.

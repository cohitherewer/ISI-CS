The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Flair and fun at your fingertips

 BRIGHTLY-COATED ACRYLIC 

 NAILS ARE BEING SPORTED BY ALL FROM BOLLYWOOD TO BALLYGUNGE. 

 SHRADHA AGARWAL PUTS HER FINGER ON THE SAUCY STYLE 

 STATEMENT OF THE DAY

 As fashion cycles turn up, down, and all around, the nails style story in the city is also taking a trendy twist this party season. All glam, lots of red, some shine and more glitter... fingertips are busy telling a fashion tale of their own.

 Its time to bid adieu to the safe-so-that-you-are-never-sorry French manicure. Though nail extensions have been around for a couple of years, Calcutta fashionistas have now come out of their safety shell of whites and nudes. The nail bars of the salons across the city are buzzing with activity, says beauty expert Sharon Tomkyns.

 Goodlife puts its finger on the nail trend.

 Whos sporting them? 

 Name the star and youve got them flaunting the it saucy style of the moment. Bollywood or Hollywood, the stars have style at their fingertips. Literally.

 Kareena Kapoor favours nail extensions in contrasts. She is often seen sporting bright pink or orange nails boasting of exotic art work or simply a sensual scarlet with an all-black ensemble while walking the ramp for designer buddy Manish Malhotra.

 Sexy mom Malaika Arora Khan has also pointed a pretty finger right from her Nach Baliye 2 days to her more recent public appearances. Bengali bombshell Bipasha Basu had them long and vibrant, in Dhoom:2 and also at award functions. So have Rani Mukherjee, Ameesha Patel 

 Style story

 Nail extensions arent just for people who cant stop biting their nails. From becoming a one-stop practical solution, they have become one of the latest style statements to flaunt. The most sophisticated technology for nail extensions today is gel nails, an upgraded version of acrylic nails.

 Beauty expert Bridgette Jones says: Nails are a big thing now. Most of the stars sport extensions, whether they admit it or not. These are stronger and the base is smooth without any cracks. People are flocking in for nail extensions, with or without nail art.

 Sharon shares more on gel nails...

 Gel 

 nails come in different shapes (oval, square and pointed), 

 but square is the shape of the moment. 

 These nails, unlike regular false 

 nails, are permanent since they grow with your nails.

 False nails are stuck on the cuticles, leaving no breathing space but gel nails are fixed on the tip and then filed into the natural nail.

 Be careful if you are a computer person or have a green thumb. Use gloves if possible. 

 Dont use nail paint remover that contains acetone.

 Go back for an in-fill to cover the gap once your nails grow every three to four weeks, depending on how fast they grow.

 A set of gel nails comes for Rs 1,500. The in-fill is another Rs 750 per sitting.

 Nail art costs around Rs 50 per nail.

 The process of fixing the gel nails takes about an hour.

 Seasons stunners 

 More nail, more space, more creativity. Long nails, gel or natural, are just waiting to be splashed with colour and more. The seasons stunners are lots of glitter, lots of gold and a riot of red.

 Though it all depends on her mood and outfit, red is huge this time; its like what black is to a little dress, says Bridgette. To play up a subdued ensemble or fire up an already OTT (over the top) outfit, red is the way to be. Nails, like all other accessories, can be worked around to either complement or contrast your overall style package.

 Heres Bridgettes take on todays pop picks...

 Choose from various designs to accentuate your nails polka dots, hot lips, delicate flowers 

 Gold is big, use it liberally. 

 Striking contrasts are in. 

 If sober is more your style, go for a pearl-like look. It is translucent and looks pretty. 

 The tips are not white any more. Splash them with gold or black for the Gothic look.

 Nail piercing is avoidable on real nails.

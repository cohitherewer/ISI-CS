The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Annette Bening

 You are willing to let your partner have their own life. You get perturbed when your partner is too clingy or dependent. You like life with lots of passion and action. You are not the type who will get hurt if you are cheated in love. Courtship fascinates you more than love itself. You like working in a friendly environment.

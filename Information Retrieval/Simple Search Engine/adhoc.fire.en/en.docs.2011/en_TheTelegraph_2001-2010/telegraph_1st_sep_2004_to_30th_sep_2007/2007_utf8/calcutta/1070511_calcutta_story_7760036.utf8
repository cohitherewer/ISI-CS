The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dairy plans study to cut its losses

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Eager to check the drop in its sales, Mother Dairy is planning a study that will investigate its shortcomings in attracting the consumer. According to sources, the dairys sales (Telegraph

 to 3.5lakh litres within a year.

 Consultancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers has been engaged by the animal resources department to conduct the study. The report is likely to be submitted by July.

 Chief general manager of Mother Dairy, Calcutta, S.K. Chanda, said: There has been an increase in commodity prices but we will not go for a price hike. We are trying to rearrange things in the management, and the findings and recommendations of the study will be of immense help.

 Earlier run by the National Dairy Development Board, the dairy was acquired by the state government 10 years ago. The dairys reserve was Rs 60crore at the time of the takeover. Now, with the drop in profits, the reserve has come down to Rs 40crore, said a senior official of the dairy.

 Milk commissioner Sundar Majumdar said: The price of skimmed milk powder has increased, from Rs 119.75 a kg last year to Rs 130 a kg at present, adding to problems. The operational cost of Mother Dairy is also comparatively higher, with more people handling less milk, he added.

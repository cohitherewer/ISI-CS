 With the World Cup cricket already underway, tour operators are busy offering last-minute discounts to attract Calcuttans to the Caribbean islands.

 The tour packages on offer spanning eight, 12 and 20 nights include tickets to the cricket clashes and stay aboard cruise liners, instead of hotels.

 SOTC, one of the organisers of the trips to the Cup venues, is offering 50 per cent discount on tour expenses that vary from Rs 3.5 lakh to Rs 6.83 lakh, depending on the duration of the stay and the type of cabins booked on the luxury liners.

 Air-India will operate a special flight from Mumbai to Barbados, said Sanjay Kothari, head (east), corporate tours, SOTC.

 The idea of staying on luxury cruises, floating from one island to another, has caught the fancy of many Calcuttans. There have been a lot of queries, added Kothari.

 The SOTC basket has four packages for the Cup. Caribbean Experience, from April 10 to 30, comes with tickets for the three Super Eight matches of India against England, Pakistan and West Indies, one semi-final and the final.

 Encounter in Barbados, from April 10 to 22, comes with tickets for only the three Super Eight matches. Final Mission, April 22 to 30, will have tickets for one semi-final and the final.

 Down Under Action in Antigua, from March 30 to April 6, will cover Indias two matches against New Zealand and Australia.

 The accommodation in the first three packages has been arranged on cruise liners, but the bookings in Antigua are in resorts.

 The demand for the packages will pick up as the the tournament progresses, said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India.

 Though bookings are satisfactory, he added, some of the regular travellers are opting out because of the expenses. According to tour operators, the expenses are almost double than they were in South Africa, where the last Cup was held.

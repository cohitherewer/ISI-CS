 A heady wave of wow whiffs

 The city is developing a nose for the nice, and so fragrances from across the globe are wafting in. Gone are the days when a single cherished bottle of lavender water or some French perfume would be dug out of her wardrobe and sprinkled only on special occasions. Smelling good is an everyday need now, and the whiff changes with mood and moment.

 The perfume market has really opened up in the past one-and-a-half years and the reason is the growing awareness among people about perfumes, says Naveen Misra, unit head, Shoppers Stop. 

 People here are now more educated about the need to match their perfume with the occasion, season and time of day. They are not going in for the same perfume for day and evening wear. As the demand rises, retailers are bringing in a variety of products and most brands are targeting the Indian market.

 Firozuddin, proprietor of Paradiso, a popular perfume shop on Camac Street, feels legalising import of perfumes has been crucial in opening up the market and bringing in more brands. 

 Earlier, foreign perfumes sold in Calcutta were all smuggled in, and sellers would only bring in perfumes for which they knew a demand existed, he says.

 So, smelling good no longer remains the womans prerogative. The demand for mens perfume has seen a tremendous boom in the past eight months. And men are now really choosy about the kind of perfume they are picking up, stresses Naveen.

 At many stores in the city, this has meant the flooding of brands from foreign shores. The demand for French perfumes remains high, but in the past year or two, we have found perfumes from the UK and Germany finding a big market, reveals a spokesperson for Nik-Nish.

 At The Royal Store in New Market, one of the citys old perfume haunts, brands doing well include Carolina Herrera and Kenneth Cole from the US, Versace and Bvlgari from Italy, Myrugia from Spain and Rasasi from Central Asia. 

 While Carolina Herrera has been around for the past five years, the likes of Myrugia or Bvlgari have only found a market in the past 12 months. 

 The use of perfume has increased in the past few years, and its starting from a younger age now. The market has grown by at least 10-15 per cent in 2006, says Ajoy Shaw, of The Royal Store.

 The market has grown in both number and nature. Buyers often steer clear of conventional floral fragrances. Sporty, woody, spicy and aquatic smells are doing well, says Shaw.

 At Nik-Nish too, there is a marked preference for aquatic smells. And many women who prefer being in jeans and sneakers are giving the light, feminine fragrances a miss and trying out the male smell. 

 More and more women are showing a preference for male perfumes. Because of our tropical climate, everyone tends to sweat more and they want a fragrance thats stronger and stays longer, explains Naveen.

 In fact, the real revolution in the past two years has been the soaring demand for deodorants, affordable and useful. 

 For every bottle of perfume, we sell 10 bottles of deodorants. A good brand of deo can be picked up for as low as Rs 150. This is because the perfume content in a deo is very low. But its great for daily use, explains Shaw.

 The boom is happening, but Calcutta still has some catching up to do. 

 The buying capacity here 

 is still limited and the tradition of gifting perfumes, 

 which forms a major share of perfume sale elsewhere, is 

 almost absent, grumbles Firozuddin.

 Like so many other things, on 

 the fragrance front Calcutta is getting there.

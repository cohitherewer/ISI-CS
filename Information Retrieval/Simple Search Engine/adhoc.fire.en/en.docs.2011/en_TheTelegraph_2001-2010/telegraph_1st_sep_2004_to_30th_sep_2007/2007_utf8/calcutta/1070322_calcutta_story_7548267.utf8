The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 NRI bag swipe in airport cab line

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The gateway to Calcutta is fast gaining a reputation it can do without. Days after the loss of a laptop and the theft of a mobile phone at the airport, an NRI had his bag containing money and documents stolen from a trolley in the international terminal. 

 Shyamal Bhattacharya (picture

 Houston, Texas, was waiting at the pre-paid taxi counter

 last Saturday afternoon when his bag containing around

 $5,000, Rs 8,000, passport, visa, return air tickets

 and other documents went missing.

 Bhattacharya had touched down in New Delhi on March 13 and headed for Bagdogra to visit his in-laws, before arriving in Calcutta on March 17 by the Jet Airways flight from Bagdogra around 3.15 pm. Bhattacharya decided to convert some dollars and so went over to the international terminal. He then proceeded to the pre-paid taxi counter.

 When he received the slip from the counter, Bhattacharya noticed there was no mention of the vehicle number or name of the driver that would take him to Netaji Nagar, in Tollygunge.

 I went to the counter to clarify and then immediately returned to the trolley, only to find my small red pouch with money and papers missing, Bhattacharya told Metro.

 He complained to the airport manager at once, who asked him to lodge a police complaint. I promptly filed a complaint but four days have passed and no action has been taken, alleged Bhattacharya.

 Airport officials said they were probing the matter.

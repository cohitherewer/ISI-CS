 Calcutta is catching up with Mumbai and New Delhi in terms of facilities for replacement surgeries, especially of the knees and hips.

 There have been tremendous advances in the technology for replacement surgeries. The costs have come down. The doctors, too, are of international standards, said Chandrasekhar Dhar, a senior member of the West Bengal Orthopaedic Association. According to him, city surgeons are now performing replacement surgeries with a complication rate of two to four per cent, on a par with advanced countries.

 Suresh Shah, a doctor from Andheri West, in Mumbai, came to Calcutta last year to have his hips replaced. I spoke to many doctors in Mumbai, Delhi and other places before opting for Calcutta, he said. While doctors in Mumbai and New Delhi did not agree to conduct replacement surgeries on both the hips at the same time, orthopaedic surgeon Vikash Kapoor successfully replaced my hips on the same day in Calcutta.

 Kavita Khanna, the wife of Sharad Kumar Khanna, the deputy director of Rajasthans health and family welfare department, underwent hip and knee replacement surgeries on the same day at a private hospital in Calcutta. 

 I consulted doctors in Mumbai and Delhi before coming down to Calcutta. The surgeries cost me less than they would have cost in Mumbai or Delhi, said the doctor from his residence at Ajmer.

 Orthopaedic surgeon P.K. Banerjee said the demand for replacement surgeries is rapidly increasing in Calcutta. It is growing by at least 30 per cent per year, said Banerjee. But only a small percentage of those who require such surgeries undergo them, he added.

 At least 75,000 people currently need knee or hip replacement in Calcutta. But according to our estimate, only about 5,000 such surgeries will take place here in 2007, said Dhar.

 Murder charge on four

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A week after a quack and his nine-year-old daughter were found dead in their Howrah home, police added a new chapter to the sex-abortion-cellphone saga. 

 Less than 24 hours after questioning the veracity of a post-mortem report that claimed Jayanta Bag was murdered, the police slapped murder charges on four young men, who had allegedly assaulted him, his wife Sutapa and daughter Tiyasa. 

 We wanted to play safe and thats why we have brought charges under Section 302. This, however, does not mean that the murder theory has been established, said a senior district police officer. 

 Initially, the police had said that Jayanta killed himself after trying to kill his wife and daughter. Sutapa survived. 

 Her statement will be crucial in the probe But she is still in a state of shock and we are waiting to interrogate her, said Niraj Kumar Singh, Howrahs superintendent of police. 

 Among the four youth mentioned in Bags suicide note, Ujjwal Biswas and Raju Roy were arrested on two consecutive days. On Tuesday, the police had its third catch, as Chandu Koley, 22, surrendered at the Howrah chief judicial magistrates court. 

 As the case swung between the extremes of a suicide saga and a murder mystery, the state government pressed another agency into service. We have asked the CID to probe the case and file a report at the earliest, said home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray. 

 But officers of Jagacha police station continued their raids and seized a photo album containing nude pictures of women, two CDs, a DVD player, a VCD and a still camera from Bags home. 

 Since he had been running abortion clinics in several villages of Howrah, we are probing whether he was involved in any pornography racket. We will scan the retrieved objects, said an officer.

 Police have also seized a computer and a CD-writer from an Andul shop. We are looking for the shop-owner, as he was known to Bag, said a police officer.

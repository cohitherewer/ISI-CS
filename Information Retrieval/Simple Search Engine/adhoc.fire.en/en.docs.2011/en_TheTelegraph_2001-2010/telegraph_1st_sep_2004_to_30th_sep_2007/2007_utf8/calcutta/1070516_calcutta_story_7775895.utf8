 The islands off Parama Investigation Centre and Ruby Hospital, on the EM Bypass, will be cut to size for smoother flow of traffic.

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), transport department and the traffic police have been forced to take up the project because of the rapid increase in traffic on the Bypass. The two islands have been chosen as they stand at the busiest intersections on the road.

 The intersection length which is the distance to be covered to cross an intersection should be as short as possible. The shortest distance between two points is, obviously, a straight line. On the Bypass, the vehicles are forced to drive round a bend because of the large radius of the islands. The proposed modifications are based on fundamental traffic management rules, explained a senior traffic department engineer. 

 The Parama island has a diameter of about 64 m, as a result of which vehicles take too long to cross it. The island also makes it impossible for a traffic constable on one end of the intersection to see the other end. 

 According to the engineers, making the islands smaller would reduce the time taken to cross the intersection by almost 46 per cent.

 A bay, about 4.5 m wide, will also be constructed for buses turning north at the Parama intersection. This will ensure that the vehicles trailing a bus are not held up while it turns left. The police have found that large vehicles holding up several others while turning is one of the major problems at the crossings. 

 Engineers of the traffic department and officers of Sealdah and South-East Traffic Guard recently visited the intersections to study the traffic flow and the impediments to it.

 We have held talks with the engineers and planners. The CMDA is willing to make the islands smaller. This is a necessity, given the rise in car population along the Bypass, said deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim.

 But why were the islands built in the first place? We thought that the traffic would flow and signals would not be needed. Accordingly, signals were not set up at the intersections. But the volume of traffic has grown unbelievably, said Debdas Bhattacharya, a senior CMDA officer responsible for traffic and transportation management.

 Shamim added: Signals will now be set up at the crossings, though they traditionally dont feature at rotaries.

 Officers of the South-East Traffic Guard welcomed the move. Once the Prince Anwar Shah Road connector opens, the volume of traffic on the Bypass will increase even more. The move was a must, said an officer.

 Right to hairy lip fight lost

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Victor Joynath De: Moustache man 

Retired flight purser Victor Joynath De has lost an eight-year fight for the right to sport a handlebar moustache at work. His former employer Indian (airline) had punished him for refusing to trim his moustache.

 A Calcutta High Court division bench of Justice Asim Banerjee and Justice Tapas Giri ruled on Friday in favour of an appeal by Indian against an earlier order by a single judge bench.

 De, a purser with Indian, was first grounded and then forced to retire on January 11, 2001 at the age of 55, three years before he was scheduled to retire after he refused to trim his moustache. 

 On August 2002, Justice Alok Chakraborty of the high court had ruled that De could keep his moustache and fly as a crew member.

 In Fridays order, however, the division bench observed that flight personnel should obey the rules framed by the employers. 

 This judgment is a victory for the discipline the company represents. Flying crewmen should have a uniformity in appearance, said counsel for Indian, R.N. Majumdar, after Fridays verdict.

 However, De is not willing to give up on his right to sport a moustache at work. He claimed that sporting a moustache is part of his familys tradition. The man from Elliot Road is planning to move the Supreme Court against the division bench order.

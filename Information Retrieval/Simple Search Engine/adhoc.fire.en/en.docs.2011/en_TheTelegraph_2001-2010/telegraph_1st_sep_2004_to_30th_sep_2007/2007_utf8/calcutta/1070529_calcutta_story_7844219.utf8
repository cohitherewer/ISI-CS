 A traffic sergeant chased a taxi in which a 28-year-old transporter was being abducted down Chittaranjan Avenue on Sunday evening and rescued him. The cop also arrested one of the two abductors. 

 Prasenjit Sen, of the Jorabagan traffic guard, was patrolling near Mahajati Sadan, around 6pm on Sunday, with minutes to go for the chief ministers convoy to pass through. He heard a man cry for help from inside a moving taxi. There were two other men in the vehicle, who were beating him up.

 Sen followed the taxi and intercepted it at the crossing of Munshi Sadruddin Avenue and Chittaranjan Avenue. One of the abductors jumped out and ran away. The other abductor, Adil Iqbal, 30, was arrested. Two constables deployed in the area helped Sen rescue the hostage.

 According to the police, Iqbal and his associate dragged Raju Joshi into the taxi near Medical College and Hospital while he was taking a walk.

 The taxi driver said the duo had hired the cab on Chittaranjan Avenue around 5.40pm and asked him to drive around the area. As soon as the men noticed Joshi, they asked the driver to slow down. Iqbal got off the vehicle and dragged Joshi inside. 

 The taxi driver realised the intention of the duo and refused to drive. He asked them to get off. The abductors then beat up the driver, said Sen.

 The two were attempting to kidnap Joshi for ransom, said an officer of Bowbazar police station. We are interrogating Iqbal to ascertain whether he and his associate were employed by Rajus business rivals. We are also looking for the associate, he added.

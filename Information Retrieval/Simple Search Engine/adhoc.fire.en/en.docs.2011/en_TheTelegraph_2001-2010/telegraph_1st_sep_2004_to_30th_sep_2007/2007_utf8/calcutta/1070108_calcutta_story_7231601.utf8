 Police prod for tram track repairs

 - Government agency asked to complete pending projects by 45 days

 KINSUK BASU 

With the winter holiday over and traffic back to normal on the city streets, police have woken up to the need to get the concretisation of tram tracks completed on key stretches.

 The traffic police top brass have shot off letters to the administrators of the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), asking the government agency to pressure its contractors to complete the pending track concretisation work within the next 45 days.

 Police have laid emphasis on three zones the junction of Diamond Harbour Road and Circular Garden Reach Road in Kidderpore, Bidhan Sarani and Rabindra Sarani.

 The cops have also called upon the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) officials to lend support to the concretisation work to ensure that it is not hampered owing to projects like laying of pipelines.

 The main objective is to offer more road space to vehicular traffic as quickly as possible, according to the cops. 

 We have tried to make the HRBC realise the problem of keeping vital stretches closed to traffic for days. We want the agency to speed up work so that the roads can be thrown open within a month and a half, said deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim.

 We have been trying for some time to impress upon the HRBC the need to complete the work. We have now asked the agency not to offer any excuses and just meet the deadline. The work on key stretches should have been over when the schools were closed for the winter holiday, he added.

 The tram track concretisation on Rabindra Sarani from Ganesh Talkies to Rabindra Kanan has taken a beating due to delay by the HRBC contractors as well as digging by the CMC staff. 

 Work on the nearly-one-km stretch began in December. Despite repeated pleas for quick completion, the project is dragging. The HRBC and the CMC have been trading charges over the cause of the delay. 

 About a week back, there was a leak in an underground water pipe, near the western end of Aankh Patty. The HRBC and the CMC passed the buck, even as local residents set up a blockade demanding repair of the pipe. To top it, workers suddenly went on leave. They have now been asked to finish the work by January, stated a senior officer of Jorabagan Traffic Guard.

 On Circular Garden Reach Road, the work for tram-track concretisation has been going on for over six months. This time, the cops want a date by which the work will be over.

 Work on the last stretch, from Manasatala Road to the intersection of Circular Garden Reach Road and Diamond Harbour Road, is yet to be completed, but civic officials have dug up the area. The problem is that neither the vehicular movement nor the work can be stalled, said an officer of Vidyasagar Setu Traffic Guard.

 The civic officials said the road had been dug to divert the underground water line, so that the HRBC can start the piling work for the proposed Kidderpore bridge. We will need at least a fortnight to finish the work. Unless the project is completed, the other work cant be started. The people have to bear with us, said director-general of water supply in civic body Bibhas Maity. 

 The HRBC officials refused to admit any backlog but offered that there have been forced delays owing to several factors beyond the agencys control. Work on the BB Ganguly-MG Road stretch was completed quickly, without any hitches. Similarly, the tram tracks between Hatibagan and the Shyambazar five-point crossing were delivered on time. We have asked the contractors to deliver by the deadline, said a senior HRBC official.

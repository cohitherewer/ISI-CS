 Food dear, power off

 A rising water level, contaminated drinking water, prolonged power cuts, expensive daily-use items, crippled communication facilities life was miserable in Calcutta on Wednesday, as 48 hours of rain took a toll on both basic services and entertainment options. 

 The water on the road made its way into homes in many parts. Thousands living on the ground floor had to wade through water from room to room. The water gushed in through the drains to flood the bathrooms, too.

 There was also scarcity of drinking water, as drain water leaked into underground reservoirs. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation had to send five tanks of water to the deputy commissioner (north)s office on APC Road for the second consecutive day.

 To avoid accidents, CESC switched off power at Ananda Palit Road, Entally, Amherst Street, New Ballygunge, Mohammad Ali Park, Elgin Road, parts of Behala, Thakurpukur, New Alipore and Salkia.

 We are trying to ensure that supply is restored as soon as the rainwater recedes. We regret the inconvenience, said a CESC official.

 The prices of vegetables, on an average, went up by Rs 5 a kg. Potatoes, however, cost only Rs 1 more per kg than usual. 

 Vegetables have become expensive because of irregular train services and waterlogging. The price of fish has not gone up much, said Samir Pal, the general secretary of College Street Market Byabsai Samity.

 Water seeped into the pumping station that supplies water to 89 Cinemas, forcing it to down shutters. We had hoped to run some late evening shows, but even that was not possible, said Debashish Ghoshal, the CEO of the multiplex at Swabhumi. It had done 35 per cent more business than usual on Tuesday.

 Crossword has been shut since Tuesday. Whether we will be able to open on Thursday or not depends on the level of water on Elgin Road. Things look bleak now, said Sidharth Pansari, the managing director of the bookstore.

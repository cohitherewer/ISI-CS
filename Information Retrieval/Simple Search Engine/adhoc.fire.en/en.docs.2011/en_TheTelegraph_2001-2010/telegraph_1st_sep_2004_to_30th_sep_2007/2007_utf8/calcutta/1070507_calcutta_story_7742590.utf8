 Railway resents detention

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Eastern Railway has decided to take up with the state judicial department on Monday the matter of the detention of a motorman and a guard of a local train by a railway magistrate.

 On Saturday, Mintu Mallick, a railway magistrate of Sealdah court, who boarded the drivers cabin to avoid the rush of passengers, ordered the detention of the motorman and the guard for allegedly misbehaving with him. 

 The move set off a chain of events that stalled train services and triggered chaos for five hours at Sealdah station. 

 The agitated passengers, fuming at the delay, ransacked the Sealdah senior station managers office.

 We will discuss the matter with the highest authorities of the judiciary. Such incidents should be prevented in future, Somnath Mukherjee, additional general manager, Eastern Railway, said. 

 A meeting will be held on Monday to discuss the next course of action, railway officials said. 

 Senior officers alleged that Mallick lost his temper when the driver asked to see his credentials and argued with him. 

 After the train reached Sealdah, Mallick asked the Government Railway Police (GRP) to take the duo to his court. He asked them to furnish a written apology for their misconduct and later released them. 

 The railway authorities also criticised the GRPs move of taking the duo into custody without any written complaint or FIR. 

 Officials of the GRP, however, said the duo was not arrested. The magistrate came to the GRP station and asked us to take them to his court, said a GRP official.

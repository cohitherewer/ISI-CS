The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 He has a dream, its not a theme 

 Calcuttan Of The Week 

 Who: Nemai Chandra Pal

 Profession: Idol maker in Kumartuli

 USP: Steers clear of theme Pujas; makes Sabeki idols

 Why? Pal (picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya) has only made one theme idol in his career spanning three decades. I made a Durga idol that looked as if it was made of terracotta. The body colour of the Goddess was like burnt brick. But that one experience was disturbing enough for him.

 He makes it clear that such idols inspire no devotion. Otherwise why would they worship a small regular idol alongside? he questions. The theme idols are just for decoration. I do not like theme pujas. I made one that time because the customer wanted it. I have my livelihood to earn. If I hadnt made it someone else would have, Pal reasons. 

 Tradition rules: The veteran of Kumartuli, who started work at 22 (he is 59 now), wishes to create the image of Ma. The trend of theme Pujas is almost gone, Sabeki protima is here to stay, says Pal with conviction.

 Last year, he made 17 Sabeki ekchalar protimas, the highest number of ekchalar protima he has made in a year.

 These idols are made for worship and not just as works of art. And a goddess has to look like a goddess, he says firmly. 

 Offshore experience: Pals idols have been worshipped at America, London, Australia and Belgium. He has been regularly sending idols abroad since 1996. 

 Behind celebrations: Is a lot of darkness. Yes, we enjoy a lot of respect, but there is no prospect of a better life, sighs Pal, as he works away on a small idol, in his tiny workshop. The place is badly in need of maintenance.

 And Pal is one of better off artists. We earn only during the three months of Durga Puja and Kali Puja. In the other months there is no steady income, he sighs.

 Puja committees that spend lakhs on pandal decoration and lighting, are tight-fisted when it comes to paying the idol-makers. So disillusioned is Pal, that he doesnt want his son to follow in his footsteps either.

 I do not want my son to become an idol-maker. I want him to have a steady job or open some business, he asserts.

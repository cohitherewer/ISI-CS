 The chief minister laid the foundation stone of a housing estate and handed over the keys to 352 one-room flats to evicted settlers at Nonadanga on Tuesday. 

 Residents of erstwhile Gobindapur railway colony will be rehabilitated at the estate.

 The flats will house squatters evicted from canal banks in the city.

 The estate is coming up on a 10.36-acre plot, worth Rs 62 crore. Each flat will cost about Rs 1.2 lakh. Each evicted family will have to pay Rs 20,000 to take possession of their unit.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee pointed out at the inaugural function that the government had decided to rehabilitate the colony dwellers after the railways declined to make arrangements for them. 

 The railways should have taken the initiative to rehabilitate those evicted from Gobindapur railway colony. But when it failed to do so, it was up to us to stand by the needy, stated Bhattacharjee.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, who was also present, appealed to the canal-bank evictees who have been allotted flats at Nonadanga not to sell them.

 We have been able to provide the basic infrastructure for the evicted families. But they should never think of selling the allotted flats for a higher price, as they will end on the streets, fighting to survive. The government cannot afford to cater to people who do not want to help themselves, observed Bhattacharyya.

 Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya requested the residents to behave as responsible citizens. We are handing over the keys to 352 evicted families, each of which has paid Rs 5,000. We are planning to rehabilitate nearly two lakh people over the next two years.

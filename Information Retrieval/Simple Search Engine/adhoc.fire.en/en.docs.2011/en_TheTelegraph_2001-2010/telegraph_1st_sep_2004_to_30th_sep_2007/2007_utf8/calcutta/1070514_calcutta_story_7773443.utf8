 Tollywood grinds to halt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Shooting has come to a halt for an indefinite period in Tollywood, with a large section of technicians going on strike from Monday. The strike is the fallout of a work dispute between the Federation of Cine Technicians and Workers of Eastern India and its rival union, Broadcast Quality Video Technicians and Workers Association of West Bengal (Brota).

 The Federation, which has called the ceasework, failed to reach a solution at a meeting on Sunday evening. It is now hoping that the producers of films and serials will broker a truce. 

 We have called the strike to protest the May 7 incident when 50 members of Brota stormed the NT1 premises and threatened to assault the cast and crew if they didnt stop work. We will write to the producers to ensure our safety and a wage hike, said Federation secretary Partha Kar.

 A year after the two unions brought Tollywood to a stop over work distribution, last Monday saw a repeat action at NT1 with a fresh fight over the same issue. 

 The Federation threw three of our boys out of NT1 on Monday. They were working for the film Sedin Dujone. The Federation doesnt allow us to work in films, which is illegal, alleged Brota secretary Ladli Mukherjee.

 The strike will hit Tollywood hard, as the majority of technicians belong to the Federation. Work has been suspended at all the studios and also at locations outside Tollygunge.

 We will be facing a problem of locations and dates of actors once the strike is lifted. I dont know what to do now, said Raja Sen, who was shooting for his film Krishnakanter Will at Lahabari. 

 The small screen will bear the brunt, too. Our budget for a single episode will shoot up by Rs 40,000, said TV producer Atanu Roy.

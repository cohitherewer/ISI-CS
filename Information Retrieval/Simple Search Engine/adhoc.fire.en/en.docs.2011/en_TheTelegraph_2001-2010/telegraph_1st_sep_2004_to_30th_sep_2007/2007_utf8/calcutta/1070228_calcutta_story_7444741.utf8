 Installation of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras at major crossings is among a slew of measures the authorities have planned to overhaul policing in the city.

 We have identified 42 crossings for the installation of the cameras, which will have recording facility, said additional commissioner of police Kuldiep Singh. 

 The feed will be monitored round-the-clock by officers in the Lalbazar control room. Besides, microphones will be put up at the crossings to pass on necessary instructions to motorists during an emergency, he explained.

 Closed-circuit cameras are now installed at 11 crossings in the city, but they do not have any recording facility.

 The new system will help us nail traffic rule violators, as we will have videographic evidence against them. It will also enable police to keep a tab on the movement of VIPs, Singh added.

 Taking a cue from some of the best policing models across the world, the authorities will map the citys lanes and bylanes with the help of Geographical Information System and feed the data to a central monitoring system in the Lalbazar control room.

 This is how policing is carried out in advanced countries. The Centre has sanctioned our proposal and work has started, the additional commissioner said.

 The force will also have 250 vehicles fitted with transponders, so their movement can be monitored from the control room with the help of an automatic vehicle tracking system.

 As we soon as we get information about a crime, we will ask the vehicle nearest to the spot to do the needful, he said.

 The officers are also working on a proposal to set up a Critical Public Place Surveillance System for constant vigil on crucial facilities across the city. 

 A control room will be set up in the office of the Special Branch, the citys intelligence wing, where officers will monitor the feed from cameras installed around the buildings, including Writers Buildings, Raj Bhavan, Lalbazar and railway stations.

 There are around 160 installations in the city that will be brought under the vigil. The cameras will be installed in phases, the additional commissioner signed off.

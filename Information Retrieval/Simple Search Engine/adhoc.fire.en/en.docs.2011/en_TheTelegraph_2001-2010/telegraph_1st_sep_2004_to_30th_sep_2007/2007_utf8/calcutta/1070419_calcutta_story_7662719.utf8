 Tribute to a master artist

 An artist whose name has become synonymous with the visual depiction of the voice of the oppressed and downtrodden, Somenath Hore had acquired a larger-than-life image in his own lifetime. Hosted by Galerie 88, Life and Arts, the ongoing exhibition of his sculptures, graphics, drawings and paintings, is a tribute to the legendary artist on his 88th birth anniversary. Commencing his artistic career with drawing for a political cause, gaining in maturity with print-making aimed at mass appeal and moving on to the new medium of relief-prints for self-analysis, he finally emerged an accomplished sculptor, with a distinctive identity and originality. While his prints reveal his inclination for figurative art, the paintings on show bear testimony to his unique imagery, where beauty is consciously created by an act of deliberate understatement, without deviating from reality. His skill as a master sculptor can be manifested in the structured balance of his human and animal forms, carrying his signature stylised touch to emphasise persecution, tyranny and suffering.

 Event: An exhibition of sculptures, graphics, drawings and paintings by Somenath Hore When: Till May 5 (except Sundays); 3 pm - 7 pm Where: Galerie 88, 28B Shakespeare Sarani

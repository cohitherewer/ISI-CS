 Flier vomits blood, flight back

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A Bangalore-bound Jet Airways flight returned to the airport on Wednesday morning after a police officer fainted on board and later vomited blood.

 The flight took off at 7am, 10 minutes behind schedule, and returned to Calcutta at 8.10am after Ashok Sarengi, 53, fell ill mid-air. The inspector-in-charge of Farakka police station was going to Bangalore with his wife Seema to visit their son, a medical student.

 About 20 minutes after take-off, he started feeling uncomfortable and went to the toilet, said Amar Pahari, Sarengis brother-in-law. Sensing that he would faint, the officer managed to open the toilet door. The cabin crew caught him before he fell. Within a minute, Sarengi regained consciousness and started vomiting blood before fainting again, added Pahari. 

 Sarengi was admitted to AMRI hospital in Salt Lake after treatment by airport doctors. Rupture of a vein in the upper gastro-intestinal tract caused the bleeding. Chronic liver disease had led to the rupture, said a gastronenterologist at AMRI. Sarengis condition is stable.

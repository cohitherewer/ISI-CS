The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Game over, 2 drown

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two 20-year-olds drowned in east Calcutta ponds on Sunday while cooling off after a game. 

 Mohammad Iqbal, a Class X student of Kings Park High School in Topsia, had been playing cricket with his friends near Science City from dawn. Around 6am, after a match got over, the boys decided to take a dip in the waterbody belonging to Calcutta Boating and Hotel Resorts, off the EM Bypass.

 Iqbal, who jumped into the unfenced pond before the others, didnt know how to swim. He drowned before his friends arrived on the spot

 In a pond barely a kilometre away, Mohammad Raza of Kustia Road drowned a few hours later. He had decided to take a wash after a game of football and like Iqbal, did not know how to swim. 

 The boy drowned around 2pm. He flailed about for a bit and then sank, said a resident of Kustia Housing Estate, who was witness to the incident. The boys friends were in the pond at the time but could not save him. 

 We have started unnatural death cases. Preliminary investigation, however, doesnt suggest foul play. We will wait for the post-mortem reports, said South 24-Parganas police superintendent S.N. Gupta.

 Iqbal had slipped and fallen while taking a run. He had rushed to the pond after the game to wash the mud off his clothes, said his friends. They reached the waterbody minutes later and found only Iqbals clothes lying on the banks.

 The boys father, Mohammad Sabir, runs a meat shop near their Topsia Second Lane residence. He had left home at 4am and learnt about the incident much later.

 Iqbals mother Akbari Begum was distraught: He was our only son our hope for the future. He had wanted to be a cricketer but when he realised we would never be able to afford a coach, he concentrated on his studies.

 Local residents helped in the search for Iqbals body. They alerted the police. Officers from Tiljala reached the spot but did not help in the search, alleged the residents. A fishing net had to be used to find the body.

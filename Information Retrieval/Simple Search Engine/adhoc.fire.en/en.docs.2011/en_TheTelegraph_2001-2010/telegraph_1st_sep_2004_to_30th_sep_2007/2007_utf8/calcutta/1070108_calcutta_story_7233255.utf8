The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Guru 

 is about rediscovering life

 Screen On amp; Off

 A.R. RAHMAN tells Pratim D. Gupta 

 why the sky is the limit with Mani Ratnam, why he picked Luka 

 chhupi, Chhan chhan and Khalbali for the 

 Oscars, his UN song, making music with Nelly Furtado and more

 Abhishek Bachchan 

 and Aishwarya Rai in Guru 

 What is it about Mani Ratnam that makes you reserve your 

 best for him?

 I think its the vibe. The vibe 

 is very important when two creative people work together. 

 It is not about egos. It is about working towards the same 

 goal, reaching the same result. Then again, I dont reserve 

 anything special for him (laughs). It so happens. 

 Its how you get inspired by each other.

 What is the process? How do the two of you approach a film 

 score?

 Its just that once the film is 

 decided he gives opportunities to come up with ideas. Not 

 just me, whether its the cameraman, the actors, everyone. 

 He pushes the ball in your court and then you go about working 

 on it. Then he comes back when things need to be tweaked 

 around, to be made better. 

 This is very unlike certain other 

 directors, who would say: I want this and I dont want 

 anything else. There you already have the boundaries. Here, 

 with Mani, the sky is the limit. You can think about weird 

 things also and he always wants to do work which is groundbreaking. 

 Its not that you have to work hard or anything. It just 

 comes naturally with him.

 Yuva, your last work with him, had a very Bengali setting. 

 What about Guru?

 Its actually more Gujarati. Its 

 more close to Mumbai than anything else. We wanted to do 

 one song like Govinda ala re kind of thing but that 

 didnt fit into the script. So we used that sound and feel 

 in the first song which is Barso re megha megha. 

 Thats where all the big drums came in from. So, it was 

 done for a different song but it fitted into that. Its 

 all Gujarat. So there was no problem.

 Mayya mayya is on the lines of Hamma hamma and 

 Chaiyya chaiyya. When you create an item number like 

 that do you keep the popularity aspect in mind?

 In the sub-conscious mind you 

 would want the song to become popular. Thats the whole 

 reason of doing a number like that. People should sing and 

 enjoy. So we put in all into that. For Mayya mayya, 

 I took the hook from a man who was shouting mayya mayya 

 on the road when I was on the road to Haj. The word 

 mayya means water in Arabic and he was selling 

 water. Then later in Mayya mayya we have even added 

 some Gujarati lines because of the characters present in 

 the picturisation.

 Tere bina is your tribute to the great Nusrat Fateh 

 Ali Khan

 Yes, when I was doing the soundtrack 

 of Guru, I was listening to Nusratsaabs Sajna 

 tere bina. And I thought there was no such song which 

 had come into Hindi films. You know in terms of the feel. 

 So I thought it would be great to use a song like that in 

 this film. And I even used the same kind of lyrics, Tere 

 bina and it fell into the whole groove in a very different 

 way for the film. But I would say the inspiration was definitely 

 Nusratsaabs music and his style of singing.

 You didnt know a word of Hindi when you started out. These 

 days, you seem to contribute to the lyrics

 (Laughs) Its good to work 

 with people who are filled vessels like Gulzarsaab. 

 They are so calm and yet the little, little things they 

 do are fantastic. Tere bina is so simple the way 

 hes written it. Yet it complements the whole setting so 

 beautifully. And he never tries to do something which is 

 great and show the world what he can write. Its all from 

 the heart.

 Why get someone like Bappi Lahiri to sing the Guru title 

 track?

 I was at an award function in 

 2005 and I heard him sing on stage and I found his vocals 

 to be very dynamic. We intended Abhishek (Bachchan) to sing 

 that song in the film but then he was busy. And I had to 

 go abroad when he was free. So Gulzarsaab and I were 

 talking who we can try out and he said why dont you use 

 Bappi for the song. It was a great idea actually. He just 

 came from Calcutta and sang the song in two hours flat.

 How would you compare the soundtrack of Guru to your 

 last work with Mani Ratnam, Yuva?

 The music of Guru is about 

 rediscovering life. Yuva was actually more like item 

 numbers, like fillers rather than actually parts of a film. 

 But here it is all bound together, in the way Jaage hai 

 becomes the backbone of the film. Yuva started apologetically 

 ok, we will also have songs. But then here Mani said from 

 the start: Lets have songs in the story. This is more 

 like him.

 Coming to the song you have done for the United Nations, 

 was Pray for me brother your idea?

 I made the song first because 

 I have been feeling very strongly about this for quite some 

 time. You know India is really coming up as a country but 

 at the same time you are having these suicides by farmers 

 and there is so much of poverty all around. That inspired 

 me to make this song. Blaaze and I have sung it. Then the 

 United Millennium Development Cause came in. They have this 

 project of eradicating poverty from this world by 2015 and 

 so they thought of using the Pray for me brother song 

 like an anthem for that. 

 Then, Universal Music and Nokia followed

 Yes, Universal Music is coming 

 out with the song. We wanted to make a video for Pray 

 for me brother and when I told some of my friends in 

 London, they introduced me to Nokia. It is the first ever 

 video in the mobile cinemascope format. Here the frame becomes 

 vertical as opposed to the horizontal film frame format. 

 My friend Bala (of Bharatbala productions) has made the 

 video. Hes used a lot of skyscrapers to show the extremities 

 with the poor.

 You sang Pray for me brother for the first time at 

 your New Years Eve concert in Mumbai. What was the response 

 there?

 The response was very good. Before 

 I performed the song, we played a little audio-visual where 

 we showed how billions are used for wars while just a fraction 

 is required to feed people. Everyone was clapping after 

 the song and in such a hyper mood like you have on New Years 

 Eve, it was good.

 Besides that song, how did the concert go?

 I wanted to do this concert because 

 it was a great outlet for Pray for me. The other 

 good thing that happened was Nelly Furtado. We were supposed 

 to work together before but it didnt work out. Now I hear 

 shes told the press that she wants to work with me. We 

 have to do a project, which is good for me, good for her.

 Just a few days to go for the Oscar nomination list... What 

 is your gut feeling?

 Well, I am ready to be surprised, 

 in a pleasant way (laughs). I have heard that there 

 have been articles about my three songs in magazines there, 

 like Variety. Rang De Basanti is, of course, 

 there but Water is a very important film because 

 it did very well at the North American box-office. So, lets 

 see

 Why did you choose to send these three particular songs, 

 Chhan chhan (Water), Luka chhupi (Rang 

 De Basanti) and Khalbali (Rang De Basanti)?

 Chhan chhan is very important 

 in the film as it shows the exuberance of characters who 

 are facing a crisis. For the Rang De songs it was 

 very important that I chose songs which have been performed 

 by me. Luka chhupi is special not only because Lataji 

 has sung it but it also proves to be a counterpoint in the 

 film.

 What else are you working on as of now?

 Its all work in progress. So, 

 its premature to talk about them. But you will soon get 

 to hear about Golden Age, Shekhar Kapurs sequel 

 to Elizabeth and Ashutosh Gowarikers Jodha Akbar.

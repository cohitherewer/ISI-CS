 Todays question: What should be done to ease the pressure on Howrah bridge? 

 Weighing heavy: Rush of vehicles over Howrah bridge

 Deepankar

 Dasgupta,

 The Vidyasagar Setu is under utilised. All vehicles including south Calcutta-bound buses should be diverted to the second Hooghly bridge. We have adequate connectors from Howrah to the second Hooghly Bridge, which is further well-connected to south Calcutta and parts of South 24-Parganas. It is also well-connected to Dalhousie and Esplanade. The other option is to ban the entry of all heavy vehicles.

 Howrah bridge is under stress due to Howrah station. Each day, more than 4.5 lakh passengers avail of the trains. The route for most passengers is via Howrah bridge. More passengers mean more vehicles and traffic snarls on the bridge. 

 The government should think of an alternative route for the Calcutta-bound passengers. They can shift the station from Howrah to Shalimar, so that passengers use the second Hooghly bridge.

 Reduce traffic congestion on the bridge. Ensure free flow of vehicles over it so that it carries less weight at a given point of time. Easing the pressure on Howrah station can also help. With less number of trains, the number of commuters will also be lesser. The toll fare on Vidyasagar Setu should be reduced so that trucks and Matadors can ply on it. Lastly, utilising Dhulagarh truck terminal will ensure fewer trucks entering the city and hence, putting less pressure on the bridge.

 A.S. Mehta,

 To ease the pressure on Howrah bridge, heavy vehicles should be taken off the road. Vehicles can be diverted through the second Hooghly bridge. Buses towards Behala Chowrasta, Parnasree, Shakuntala Park and Manton can be redirected through Vidyasagar Setu. This will save time and traffic will move faster.

 Howrah bridge is 64 years old. In June 2005, the bridge suffered a blow when a barge hit the structure and damaged two of the six main structural members supporting the bridge deck. The bridge deck was also damaged. The bridge should be closed to traffic. It should be repaired first, then used as before.

 Measures like lane system, maintaining safe distances between the vehicles and proper police regulation should be adopted at the earliest. The inter-state trucks should be allowed to ply only at night. The load should be halved. Levying a duty for heavy vehicles can also help in maintaining the bridge.

 Authorities should re-route the heavy vehicles along the second Hooghly bridge. A separate bus terminus should be built for the buses using the second Hooghly bridge.

 Heavy vehicles should be stopped from plying on the bridge. The government should take special care as the bridge is as important as any heritage building of the city.

 The traffic on Howrah bridge can be checked by reviewing the traffic load. The traffic is heavy throughout the day. Heavy vehicles like trucks and lorries should be stopped from entering the bridge. 

 Diptimoy Ghosh, 

 Salt Lake

 An alternative bridge should be built at once to minimise the pressure on the 64-year-old city landmark. Traffic can also be re-routed via second Hooghly bridge. 

P. Pramanik,

 The ferry service on river Hooghly should be encouraged. This would also help in checking the level of pollution.

 Debalina Das,

 Santoshpur

 The traffic congestion on the bridge should be minimised first. Besides, proper maintenance is also needed. An alternative route to Howrah station and Howrah town can also help.

 Debasish Das,

 Tollygunge 

 Howrah bridge should be closed to heavy vehicles. Just buses, cars and rickshaws should be allowed to ply on the bridge. In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the use of the bridge and the load factor has also risen. Howrah bridge has a capacity of carrying 60,000 vehicles, but over 88,000 vehicles use it daily.

 Sunil Kumar Mishra,

 Bansdroni

 Howrah bridge is our citys pride and therefore, its preservation is of utmost importance. The government should earmark funds for its maintenance. An alternative connector to Howrah town and Howrah station is also essential to reduce the growing traffic pressure.

Manasi Chakraborty,

 We need an alternative connector. The government should ask any private builder to construct a bridge. 

 For the time being, heavy vehicles should not be allowed to ply on the bridge as a preventive measure.

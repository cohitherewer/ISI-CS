The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Auto strategy hits hard

 Having nameless voices accost you on your mobile for credit cards and insurances is insipid compared to this. New-age marketing seems to be taking a violent turn. Seen this week at the crossing near Khanna was a young man distributing leaflets in a unique way.

 No one could blame him for neglecting his duty. He stood on the road, targeting the autorickshaws, and just as an auto passed him, he would throw in a couple of the leaflets, one aimed at the front seat and one at the back. The flying objects stunned the passengers. At times these hit them hard. Leaflets grazed their eyes, or cheeks, the sharp edge of the paper stabbing at their brows, before fluttering down innocently on to their laps.

 When one recovered from the surprise to examine it, the missive or missile looked like another herbal medicine weight-loss advertisement. But on closer inspection it was revealed to be an essay on a herbal remedy for men who wanted their sexual prowess back. Some men sure got the message. 

 Channel on the move

 Not that they have a choice. But there are many reasons why Metro commuters watch Incoda TV. The extraordinary variety of programmes on the channel ranges from clippings of various movies to old songs from vintage Bengali films. Chaplin movies, anything from Sholay to Born Free, sports and wildlife features, Hindi songs. But theres a lot more. A young commuter says she watches it because the anchors are so bad that they are entertaining. Others are overwhelmed by the number of advertisements and the way they are aired. There are commercial breaks within a five-minute movie snippet. Sometimes there are two ad breaks in a song. A box that announces the days events and exhibitions occupies a good two square inches of the screen space. At the time of the football World Cup, a south Calcutta restaurant seemed to be the only place that the channel had found where the citys football fans were to be found. Its a fascinating watch. 

 Street smart

 Going by the rate at which the city is changing and landmarks are biting the dust, within a decade it will become unrecognisable even to those who have spent all their lives here. Jayanta Bagchi is trying to put back the hand of the clock to 1915 by reprinting the PM Bagchi street directory, which the famous two-volume Bengali almanac of that name used to include in its second volume. 

 Thackers street directory is better known because it was printed in English and included information on the great and the good of Calcutta, which, in those days, meant the British or the natives who were close to them.

 The PM Bagchi street directory is older it is said that it first saw light of day in 1898 and since it was in Bengali it contained detailed information on the residents of a particular street or lane, even in the black sections of the city, which Thacker never deigned to include. 

 Jayanta Bagchi, a head of PM Bagchi, spends hours everyday in his Masjidbari Street office poring over the printouts of the 600 pages whose title will be Kolkata Directory 1915. He chose this particular year because the earlier volumes were in tatters.

 Calcutta historians such as Nishith Ranjan Ray and Nikhil Sarkar had asked me to bring out a facsimile version, but I have embellished the list with details of important residents and institutions along with photographs, whenever available. The book will reproduce contemporary adverts and postage stamps as well, says Bagchi, who hopes the book will be out in two months.

 Bengals united 

 A green map highlighted in red, a splintering of communities, and stings of an ineffable pain. A 73-year-old academician browses through the different histories of the Bengal partition, and dreams of a cultural confederation of Bengali communities, sans barbed wires.

 Those interested in the nostalgic evocations of historical footnotes meet Nitish Sengupta, an academician whose recent book Bengal Divided was released by Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi on April 30. 

 Sengupta stresses Indian historiography often exaggerates the role of the Muslim League in Bengal partition. Jinnah became communal to teach Gandhi a lesson, he says. And with a smile he iterates a schoolroom truth encountered by all Bengalis outside their classrooms: If Subhas Chandra Bose were alive, there would have been no Partition. 

 He continues: I hold four people responsible for the 1947 Partition Mountbatten, Jawaharlal Nehru, MA Jinnah, and HA Suhrawardy, chief minister and leader of the Muslim League in Bengal in 1947.

 A gold medallist in history from Calcutta University in 1955, Sengupta was a student historian Sushobhan Sarkar. 

 But is unmaking really explained? One is not that sure, as history is often made, unmade, re-read, and re-done by the present, without the serried historical glosses.

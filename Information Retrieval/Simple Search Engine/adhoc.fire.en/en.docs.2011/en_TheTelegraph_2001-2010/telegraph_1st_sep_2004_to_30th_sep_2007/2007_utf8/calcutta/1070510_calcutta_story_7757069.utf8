The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Entrance date clash

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Hundreds of MA course applicants will be forced to choose between Jadavpur University (JU) and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) even before the entrance examinations have been conducted this year. 

 Both tests will be held on May 15. 

 While the JNU entrance examination starts at 9am and ends at noon, the JU test starts at noon and ends at 2pm. Hence, even those whose examination centres are in Calcutta will find it difficult to make it to both examinations. 

 A number of students have approached the JU authorities for a change in date. Swapan Chakraborty, head of the JU English department, said: We tried to consider the requests but there are internal compulsions. Departmental examinations are scheduled around that time and the dates cannot be changed. There is also a lack of space to accommodate the large number of students who are eligible to sit for the entrance examination.

 About 600 students had applied to JU for the MA admission test. More than 530 were found eligible to take the test. Most of the applicants had also applied to JNU. They have been allotted centres in Calcutta and Siliguri.

 Priyanka Sharmas JNU entrance centre is in Siliguri and JU entrance centre is in Calcutta. Since its not possible for me to be at two places at the same time, I am thinking about taking the JNU test. Most people have advised me to appear for it, she said.

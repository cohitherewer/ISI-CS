The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Whisked off and robbed

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Asim Basu was walking down RN Mukherjee Road when a taxi carrying four youths pulled up in front of him on Saturday afternoon. One of them asked Basu for an address, but when he came close to the taxi, he was dragged in.

 According to Basus complaint with police, the gang let him go only after snatching Rs 3.5 lakh and his mobile phone from him. Basu was on his way from a bank, carrying the money for a private company.

 The man claims the taxi came close to him while he was waiting to cross the road. Suddenly, one of the youths called him and asked him the way to a place in Hatibagan, said an officer of Bowbazar police station, where Basu lodged the complaint.

 Soon after Basu gave the direction, one of the gang members opened the taxis rear door and pulled him in.

 From RN Mukherjee Road, the gang moved down Lenin Sarani and dumped Basu after crossing the Wellington crossing. The money and the phone were taken away him, the officer added.

 A preliminary investigations suggests that the youths knew that Basu would carry the money back from the bank at that time and were waiting for him to reach RN Mukherjee Road. The question about the Hatibagan address was aimed at bringing him close to the taxi, so he could be dragged in without anyone noticing them.

 It could be that the gang was tipped off over the mobile phone by someone who was following the man. But whats baffling us is how the youths managed to carry away the man so far through the crowded streets, said an investigating officer.

 Sixty years on and not much seems to have changed. Honour killings, domestic violence, low rates of literacy, mullah-ism and madarsa culture are still widespread and rampant. But there is hope yet, for women are coming out in droves protesting violence, educating themselves and taking on the role of providers. 

 Women from both sides of the Indus got together at ITC Sonar Kolkata on August 22 to take stock of their situation after 60 years of Independence. And sharing their experience from Pakistan were three women invited by the Ladies Study Group (LSG). 

 Ameena Saiyid, the managing director of Oxford University Press, Pakistan; Rukhsana Zia, the director of the directorate of staff development, Punjab, and Nargis Rahman, the chairperson of Karachi Womens Peace Committee, were in town to address an LSG gathering. 

 Building Bridges of Peace and Harmony, Sixty Years On Insights from Pakistan, a talk to commemorate the 60th year of Independence, threw light on womens status in Pakistan.

 The afternoon session was flagged off by Zia, who believes conditions in Pakistan mirror those in India. What happens in your jhopadpattis are similar to what happens in our kachiabadis. There are commonalties as well as differences as we are on the same path with shared histories, cultures and mores. 

 Saiyid, who heads an MNC in a country not known to have many women in the boardroom, sees hope as more and more women join the workplace. With electrification of the villages, there is a lot of media exposure, leading to greater awareness and consequent empowerment.

 She lauded Pakistans private schools that have made a dramatic difference to womens education. Almost 70 per cent of all school-going children in Karachis low-income Orangi district are enrolled in private schools which charge a modest fee, yet are doing better than many public schools, she said. The role of the free press in Pakistan has also helped acting as a watchdog over the government.

 However, fundamentalism advocated by a handful still remains the bane of an increasingly democratic Pakistan. Sharing her experience, Rahman, who has worked extensively at the grassroots level, said: Non-education and drug addiction are rampant among the men. It is left to the women to run the households.

 There is light amid the gloom. She narrated the story of a school, run from a mosque in a graveyard by a former convict, where 30 children are being taught a secular curriculum.

 Inquiry into death at clinic

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A state health department team visited the Mission of Mercy Hospital and Research Centre, on Park Street, on Tuesday as part of the probe into the death of Patrick Cranston last Saturday.

 Two of our officials have visited the hospital to probe the death. We expect a report on Wednesday, said health services director Sanchita Baksi. 

 A source said the team verified papers related to Cranstons treatment and talked to officials to ascertain the circumstances leading to his death.

 Cranston, 57, had been suffering from several critical ailments, including diabetes and cardiac disorder. 

 He died less than a day after the authorities stopped his treatment because of non-payment of dues.

 Even as the government team was conducting the probe, some doctors at the hospital accused the management of hiding facts. The authorities didnt allow us to talk to the team. Nor did the officials try to meet us, said a doctor.

 An Indian Medical Association (IMA) team went to the hospital on Tuesday. It was an informal visit. We can formally start a probe once the management asks us to do so, said Ram Dayal Dubey, vice-president (elect) of IMA Calcutta.

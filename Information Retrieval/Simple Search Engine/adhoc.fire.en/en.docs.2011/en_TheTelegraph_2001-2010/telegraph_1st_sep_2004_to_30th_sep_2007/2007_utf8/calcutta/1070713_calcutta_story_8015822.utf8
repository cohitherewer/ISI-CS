 When life hangs in balance: A plane makes an unscheduled

 landing in Calcutta airport

 Aishik Gupta,

 Durgapur 

 Mutual help is the secret of human society. This issue, too, should be treated on humanitarian grounds. When a passenger falls so ill that the flight has to get back , other passengers should have fellow feelings to consider the seriousness. They could also be in a similar situation. Demanding compensation is not fair, but airline authorities must assume responsibility by helping the patient out and also try to arrange another flight for the others as soon as possible. 

 Biswajyoti Bagchi,

 Alipore 

 Why should the airlines pay compensation to ailing passengers for no fault of theirs? It is a humanitarian act on the part of the airlines that they make a return to help sick passengers. The passengers should reschedule their journey accordingly. 

 Kshama Agarwal, 

 Chittaranjan Avenue

 Money can never be the solution to anything and everything under the sun. The fellow passengers should be mature enough to understand the need of the hour and what should be done in that scenario. Paying compensation to other passengers on the flight is a very childish take on the subject.

 Debabrata Das,

 Tollygunge 

 Such incidents happen very rarely and cannot be considered as a regular hurdle of air travel. The fellow passengers, too, should exercise co-operation and restraint. Airlines must not pay compensation in situations where they are not at fault.

 Subhankar Mandal,

 Palta

 Airlines should pay at least 70 percent compensation to other passengers if one falls ill on board and the flight has to return. Passengers want service; if the airlines are not able to serve for any reason,then they have to compensate for that.

Paramananda Pal, 

 Karaya Road

 Most passengers in an air- journey have urgent engagements to attend

 to. They are really hamstrung if the aircraft

 returns to the port of origin, even if for the emergency treatment

 of a sick passenger on board.The question of payment of compensation

 in such cases to the inconvenienced passengers does arise, at least

 by way of refund of fares up to a reasonable percentage. It is also

 the duty of any sick passenger to notify the airline in advance about

 his sickness, if detected.

 A. Doss

 Mullick, 

 Burrabazar

 The

 airlines

 company must forward at least some compensation to the

 rest of the passengers on the flight. However, if a person

 is seriously ill and it is a life and death situation, then compensations

 can be done away on humanitarian grounds. 

Jyoti Kakarania,

 Salt Lake

 If any fellow passenger falls ill, it is an unfortunate incident for

 which the airline authority as well as

 every other fellow passenger are bound to cooperate. There is no question

 of asking for compensation.

 Shayan ghosh, 

 SN Banerjee Road

 The

 airlines

 have to pay compensation as for one person many people

 will have to suffer. The airlines must have a mini-hospital

 on board in order to provide more than first-aid. 

Hirak Roy Chowdhury,

 Ballygunge Station Road

 The airlines cannot be blamed for a passengers illness in mid-air, even if one stretches his imagination too far. The occurence rate of such incidents is so infrequent that the issue cannot be considered as a regular hurdle to air travel.

 The airlines, as part of their corporate-citizenship responsibility, do have arrangements to provide maximum comfort as far as practicable, to these passengers. 

Rathin Chatterjee,

 Dum Dum

 It is a matter of humanitarian concern

 for all passengers if one of their co- passengers falls ill on board.

 They should raise no questions on compensation but try to help the

 sick person. The airlines should, however, assume responsibility

 so that the person feeling ill is immediatley attended to by a doctor.

 They should be responsible for the sick person till he/she is completely

 fit. There should be a medical check-up before boarding.

 Nirmalya

 Biswas, 

 Hridaypur

 Necessary

 arrangements

 should be made at the airports to diagnose and detain from boarding all

 passengers in need of a possible medical attention. If the aircraft has

 to return, the airline can, at most, try to make seats available for its

 passengers in the next possible flight or return a portion of the fare,

 as for cancelled flights. 

T.R. Anand,

 Budge Budge Trunk Road 

 Airlines should not be penalised. Why not request all passengers to

 show their latest medical certificates ? No one on the earth has the

 right to penalize airlines for such hiccups.

 Nishith Mitra 

Mahinagore 

 Conscientious

 passengers

 can hardly think of claiming compensation even if they have been inconvenienced.

 There may be a few takers but the world still thrives on some good

 Samaritans who never view everything in terms of money. 

Chandralekha Sarkar

 Kasba 

 It is better to bear with the incident on humanitarian grounds, instead

 of pestering the airlines for compensation.

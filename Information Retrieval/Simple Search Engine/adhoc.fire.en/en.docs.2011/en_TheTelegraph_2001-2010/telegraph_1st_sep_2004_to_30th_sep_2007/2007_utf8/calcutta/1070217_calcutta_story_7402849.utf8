Criminal bent, say doctors

 What makes a loyalist for seven years kill the lady of the house and run away with cash and jewellery? What prompts him to create a party scene to mislead police about the murder? 

 Psychiatrists say it is a case of anti-social or dissocial personality disorder. In plainspeak, a suppressed criminal bent of mind resurfacing after years. 

 On Wednesday night, Nikku Yadav first strangled Ravinder Kaur Luthra, at whose house he had been working for seven years. Then, he spent over two hours cooking chicken kebab, serving it on a well-decorated dining table, pouring liquor in two glasses and arranging a perfect candle-lit dinner setting to swing the needle of suspicion to someone known to the 51-year-old woman. 

 Every person has greed and other negative emotions. But it is the criminal bent of mind, which prompts someone to commit a crime to the extent of murdering the benefactor, said Ranadip Ghosh, general secretary, Indian Psychiatric Society.

 The anti-social personality disorder, coupled with the greed factor, could have been accumulating over the years of seeing affluence up close and on Wednesday night, it triggered Nikkus killer instinct. 

 With Ravinders husband Ashit away in Chennai in connection with his security and logistics management business, she was alone in the 2,000-sq-ft-plus flat at Tripura Enclave, on Ballygunge Circular Road. The setting gave Nikku the perfect opportunity, and he executed a well-thought-out plan. 

 The inhibition factor, which stops somebody from committing a crime, does not work in people who have this type of personality disorder, added Ghosh. 

 According to psychiatrists, a person suffering from anti-social disorder does not have the normal values like loyalty, empathy, sympathy or remorse.

 There might have been some behavioural changes that had escaped notice, said Bidita Bhattacharya, a Delhi-based psychologist. 

 Some friends of the family have told Metro that at times, they found Nikkus behaviour odd, but the Luthras had always overlooked that. 

 Psychiatrists also point out that people suffering from such disorders normally have records of small-time criminal activities, like getting involved in frequent fights during childhood, frequent lying and acts of cruelty and involvement in small acts of fraud. 

 In Nikkus case, it is not yet known whether he had such a track record. 

 Though experts admitted that there was also a possibility of Nikku committing the murder instinctively in a fit of rage due to insult or other factors, the chronology of events following the crime negate that notion. 

 It seems he had planned the murder, robbery and his possible alibi, said Sanjay Sen, chief psychiatrist, AMRI Hospitals. 

 Staging an accident drama, Nikku got himself admitted in a hospital after falling off a bicycle on Thursday morning. But the drama ended soon, as Nikku was arrested within a few hours.

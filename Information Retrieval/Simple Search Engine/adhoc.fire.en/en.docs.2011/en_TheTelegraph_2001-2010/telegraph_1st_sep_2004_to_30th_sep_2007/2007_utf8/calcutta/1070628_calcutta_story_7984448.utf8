 Over-age principals draw flak

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Several private English-medium schools, affiliated to the ICSE or CBSE boards, have recruited principals above 60 years of age, in violation of state government rules.

 More than 20 per cent of the 400-odd ICSE and CBSE schools have principals more than 60 years old, said a teacher.

 He added that the teachers of these schools have decided to take up the matter with the boards and the government.

 The age of retirement for teachers and principals has been fixed by the government. If teachers are to retire at 60, there is no reason why principals should be allowed to continue after that age, said Ismail Nehal, former president, Association of Teachers of Anglo-Indian Schools.

 The schools are recruiting retired teachers as principals, because they agree to serve against a pay much lower than what the government or the board concerned has specified, said a teacher.

 An official of a south Calcutta school, which recently recruited a principal more than 60 years old, however, had a different explanation. The new schools need experienced principals. Retired teachers are accorded preference to ensure better discipline and academic standards.

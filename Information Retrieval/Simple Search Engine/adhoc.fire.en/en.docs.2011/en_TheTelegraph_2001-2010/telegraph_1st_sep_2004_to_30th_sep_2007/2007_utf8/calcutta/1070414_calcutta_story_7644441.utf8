 JU teachers skip classes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Some classes were not held at the science faculty of Jadavpur University (JU) on Friday, as a few teachers did not turn up, particularly in the physics and mathematics departments.

 Members of We the Independents (WTI), the organisation which has swept the science faculty students union polls, alleged that the teachers did not take classes in solidarity with the two lecturers, against whom charges were levelled by students, following the campus violence on April 5.

 The Jadavpur University Teachers Association (Juta) summoned the science faculty students union representatives on Friday to discuss the process of restoring normalcy on campus.

 The students were asked to consider withdrawing the general diaries against the lecturers Arghya Deb of the physics department and Dipak Kesh of the mathematics department. 

 We have listened to Jutas request and condemn the violence of April 5. But we want the matter to be probed thoroughly and impartially, said Pinaki Patra, a WTI representative. 

 Withdrawal of cases is not possible, for we had witnessed the duos involvement in the violence, he added.

 Nilanjana Gupta, joint secretary of Juta, said: We have discussed the issue of teachers absence at length and have decided that all teachers will take classes from Monday.

 A delegation of WTI met Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, also chancellor of the university, in his office on Friday evening. We told him that we strongly condemn the violence, but we are unfairly being branded as extremists, said Ananya Mallick, one of the five delegates.

 The organisation has launched a signature campaign demanding resumption of classes.

 The Students Federation of India (SFI) took out a procession from Gol Park to Jadavpur University. A public meeting was held at the 8B bus stand to protest the April 5 incidents. Traffic was disrupted for over half-an-hour along the Gariahat-Jadavpur stretch.

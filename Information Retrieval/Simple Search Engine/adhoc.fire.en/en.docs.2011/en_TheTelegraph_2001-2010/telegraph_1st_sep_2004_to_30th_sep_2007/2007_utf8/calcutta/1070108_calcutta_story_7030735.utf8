 CORNER OFFERS SOLUTIONS FOR HAIR WOES DURING PREGNANCY

 Klum flaunts her sunkissed tresses

 Is 

 your hair curling in places you dont want it to? 

 Is it falling lank in areas that need body? Is the frizz 

 in it likely to get you the lead role in a Center Shock 

 ad? Does the dandruff shed make your shoulder look like 

 fields of snowflakes? Did your hair wake up with highlights 

 you didnt put there? Does your comb have more hair 

 than your scalp? Welcome to the world of pregnancy hormone 

 related manic mane mood swings!

 Its true, hormones have 

 different effects on different women. So while some sprout 

 luxuriant, glossy tresses, others may be faced with limp 

 lacklustre locks. And some grow hair everywhere but on their 

 heads!

 Telogen effluvium is the glut 

 shedding of hair that usually occurs one to six months following 

 pregnancy. During pregnancy, an increased ratio of scalp 

 hairs go into the quiescent phase that is part of the normal 

 growth-loss cycle of scalp hair. After pregnancy, these 

 hairs begin to fall out. Thankfully, this condition resolves 

 itself starting six to 12 weeks postpartum. However, you 

 could help ensure that the condition does not work itself 

 into chronicity. 

 Do

 Include foods like brown rice, 

 oats, almonds, figs, dates, yoghurt, fresh fruits and vegetables 

 in your diet, as they are great for the hair.

 Massage your scalp for five or 

 10 minutes every day to kindle circulation. Oil or a moisture-based 

 conditioner would be perfect to do this with. For extra 

 pampering, go to the salon for a hair spa and tell them 

 about your condition so they create a peaceful, hazard-free 

 space that is mum-to-be friendly.

 If your hair is dry, wash it twice 

 or three times a week at the most. Your natural oils are 

 good for your hair and scalp.

 Experiment with different shampoos; 

 ones that will be suitable for the manner in which your 

 hair may most probably undergo changes. Make sure the shampoo 

 or moisturising conditioner is mild.

 Towel-dry or let your hair air 

 dry since blow-drying and curling irons increase dryness 

 at the ends. Improperly directed heat could also stimulate 

 grease on the scalp area.

 Keep your hair in longer layered 

 styles as they are easier to manage. Clip it, ponytail it 

 or leave it open so it frames your changing face shape giving 

 it an illusion of slimness.

 Chemical hair colouring 

 is best avoided during the nine months 

 Dont 

 Go for hair straightening, perming 

 and permanent colouring till conclusive scientific evidence 

 demonstrates that it is not harmful for your unborn.

 Neglect hair fall, dry and brittle 

 hair during pregnancy; this may be the result of iron, iodine 

 or protein deficiencies and/or morning sickness that can 

 deplete the body of vital nutrients.

 Colour comfort

 To ensure your hair does not feel 

 like its on a dull nine-month trudge through to the 

 delivery date, try to pep it up with natural highlighting.

 Red highlights: On damp washed 

 hair pour a mixture of half cup of beet juice mixed with 

 half cup of carrot juice. Keep on for an hour and wash off.

 Auburn highlights: Dribble a concoction 

 of either cooled strong black coffee or tea through damp 

 hair 12 to 15 times. Leave the last rinse on for 10 minutes 

 then wash with plain water.

 Blonde highlights: Pour one cup 

 of lemon juice over damp hair and leave on for an hour. 

 Wash and condition the hair as this process can be drying. 

 Sunning the hair post application will boost the colour 

 in all of the above three treatments.

 Those with greying hair could 

 try hair mascara these tubes of temporary colour come 

 with a mascara-like wand for application. Only the outer 

 layer of your hair is coated. Great for touch ups.

 Try hair extensions, in any colour 

 you want to. An expectant client wanted to have blue extensions 

 added to her hair as a sonogram revealed that she was going 

 to have a baby boy!

 Inside out

 The stress and strain of caring for and carrying around two can exacerbate hair fall and make you look fatigued, so condition yourself to relax. Practising yoga and indulging in head/foot/ body massages (with trained therapists and only in the second and third trimesters) are ideal ways of doing this. In addition to massages feeling good, a study conducted by Dr Tiffany Field at the University of Miami School of Medicine showed that it drastically reduced stress hormones in the body.

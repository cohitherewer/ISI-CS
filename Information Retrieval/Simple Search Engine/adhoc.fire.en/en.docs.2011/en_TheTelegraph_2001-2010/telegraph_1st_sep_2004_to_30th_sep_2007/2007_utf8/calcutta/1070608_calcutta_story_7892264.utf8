 For the big ones, a new zoo

 - Shift to larger enclosures on Bypass site in two years

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Prison terms for the tiger, rhinoceros, deer and other cramped quadrupeds of Alipore zoo will be over in two years, says the forest department and the wildlife board.

 Plans to shift the larger animals to an open-air site in Bhagwanpur mouza, off the EM Bypass, are taking shape, with the forest department readying a concept paper for the project.

 The shifting of the bigger zoo animals to large and specious enclosures in Bhagwanpur was the main agenda of the state wildlife boards meeting at Writers Buildings on Thursday afternoon.

 Officials of the state forest department said global tenders would be floated soon, seeking consultants for drafting a detailed project report of the new site.

 Were also contemplating whether to carry out the project on public-private partnership model, said a senior forest department official.

 Around 226 acres of government land has already been identified off the Bypass.The project cost is pegged at Rs 50 crore, of which a part will be funded by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA). 

 At the moment, Alipore zoo is too crowded and the keeping such a large number of animals together is always problematic. Of all the projects in our hand at the moment, were giving this one top priority. We plan to begin the shifting process in 2009, said Ananta Roy, state forest minister.

 In addition to the zoo, the state forest department has also planned an underground fish aquarium on the plot. 

 Alipore zoo has drawn severe criticism from the CZA in the past, which even threatened to derecognise the zoo if animals were kept in cramped conditions.

 Earlier this year, noted primatologist Jane Goodall had strongly protested the herding of chimpanzees, bears, birds, elephants and all the big cats into prison-like enclosures in Alipore zoo.

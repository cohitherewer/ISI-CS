 Beeline for campus

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The Tata Group of companies are making a beeline for the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu). 

 First, Tata Motors came to the Shibpur campus to sign up with the automobile engineering department. Now, Tata Steel is knocking on its doors to promote research in construction technology. 

 Besu is due to start a collaborative research project with Tata Steel on developing high-performance fibre reinforced concrete composites for various applications.

 The civil engineering, metallurgy and materials engineering departments will be involved in the project.

 This is an emerging technology that will be useful in building more durable and sustainable structures, said Arun Kumar Chakraborty, professor in the civil engineering department, who is also principal investigator of the project.

 A Tata Steel team visited Besu on Thursday and discussed various aspects of the tie-up with the teachers. The partners, however, are yet to decide on the funding for the project.

 According to Chakraborty, the technology can bring about a radical change in construction activities in India, as it would make concrete structures more seismic and blast-resistant. The technology, when developed, can be used to construct buildings, bridges, roads and airfields.

 The association with Tata Steel is part of the universitys agenda to foster tie-ups with companies in various research projects.

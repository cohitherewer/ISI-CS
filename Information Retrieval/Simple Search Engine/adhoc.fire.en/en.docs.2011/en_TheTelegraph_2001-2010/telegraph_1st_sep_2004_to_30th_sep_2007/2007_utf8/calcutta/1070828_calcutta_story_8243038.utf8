 The first phase of Calcutta Riverside, the Rs 1,400-crore Batanagar makeover project, with 370 apartments and golf villas and a 400-bed cardiac hospital, will be ready in 36 months.

 The project, a 25-minute drive from Taj Bengal, offers generous living spaces created around the golf course, waterbodies and the riverfront, Sumit Dabriwal, managing director, Riverbank Holdings Pvt Ltd, the company steering the 262-acre redevelopment, told Metro.

 The residential section on offer in Phase I is spread across three categories condominiums along the golf course, the riverside tower and lakefront apartments, available in a price band of Rs 2,000-3,500 per sq ft. Sample apartments were unveiled on Monday.

 A 25-acre IT-based special economic zone to incorporate 1.5 million sq ft of built space, a 440,000-sq-ft retail mall and a four-star business hotel are among the other highlights of the project, for which the HOK Planning Group, St Louise, US, was engaged to do the master plan.

 Riverbank Holdings is a joint-venture company formed with Calcutta Metropolitan Group (Hiland Group) and Bata India Ltd.

 The project aims to transform the Bata industrial campus into a well-integrated, mixed-use development that provides residential, commercial, institutional and recreational facilities, besides non-polluting employment opportunities for the city and the Mahestala community, Dabriwal added.

 A 5,000-bed health city, cutting across major specialities, will come up in the revamped township. Asia Heart Foundation, a trust chaired by cardiac surgeon Devi Shetty, will operate the health city.

 The first phase will incorporate a 400-bed super-speciality cardiac hospital.

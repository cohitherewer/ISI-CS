 ICSE eyes January start

 - Academic calendar shift to match state board 

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Winter vacations are set to become more enjoyable for school students. 

 The Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations is considering a proposal to start the academic session in its schools from January. The council conducts the ICSE and ISC examinations.

 The state government has already announced plans to follow a similar academic calendar in Madhyamik and Higher Secondary schools.

 Classes in the schools affiliated to the council currently commence in April. The board examinations are held in February-March. Their dates, too, are to be brought forward. 

 Schools under the state boards start classes in May. The Madhyamik and Higher Secondary examinations are held in February-March.

 If the council decides to advance its schedule, it will revert to the system followed before 1976. The annual examinations were held in November-December then. 

 The council needs to maintain a parity with the academic calendar followed by the state governments. In keeping with the Bengal governments decision to introduce January-to-December sessions in schools, we will start an exercise to examine whether the same system can be followed in our schools as well, said G. Arathoon, chief executive and secretary (officiating) of the council.

 According to officials, the council will not face any problem in switching to the January-to-December calendar.

 Calcutta has the highest number of ICSE-ISC schools in the country. There are more than 120 institutions affiliated to the council in the city proper. There are 180 more schools affiliated to the council in the rest of the state, most of them in the adjoining districts. A large number of new schools are awaiting affiliation with the council. 

 The state government had concluded after a series of studies that a May-to-April academic session is defective. It set up a committee in December 2006 to examine if January-to-December sessions can be introduced.

 State school education minister Partha De has announced that the state government, in principle, is ready to advance the academic calendar. The committee has almost completed examining the proposal, he stated.

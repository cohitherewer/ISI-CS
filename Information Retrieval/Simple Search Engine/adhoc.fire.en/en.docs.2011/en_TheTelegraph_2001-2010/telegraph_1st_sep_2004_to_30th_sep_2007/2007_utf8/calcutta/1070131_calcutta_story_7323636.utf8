 Crime, conviction and children

 - Juveniles being given a chance to rectify themselves

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Mohammad Irfan, 15, was arrested in Galiff Street early this year for selling banned birds. Produced in the juvenile court, he said he loved birds but could not afford to maintain them. As he did not want the winged creatures to suffer, he sold them to other bird-lovers. The judge sentenced Irfan to look after an injured dog at an animal hospital till it gets well.

 Ajay Basu (name changed), 15, was arrested for raping a minor and assaulting her relatives. The juvenile court last December asked him to serve two patients at a state-run hospital in Nadia. At the next hearing, Ajay pleaded with the judge to allow him to serve the patients for some more time. Now, he looks after around 10 patients a day, bringing them water and nursing them under the supervision of the hospital staff.

 More and more juvenile criminals are now being handed convictions that are far removed from conventional judicial verdicts. While the pronouncements of regular courts are aimed at punishing the guilty, the juvenile board tries to provide an opportunity to underage convicts to rectify themselves through philanthropy. 

 This method of dispensing justice, feels judges Mou Chakrabarty and Kunal Dey of the board, ensures that the convicts are not alienated from the mainstream after serving the sentence.

 We could easily hand down conventional verdicts, like judicial custody, to juvenile convicts, but our intention is to integrate them with the mainstream of society. Though they are charged under sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code, we try them differently, said Dey.

 Echoing Deys views, superintendent of North 24-Parganas police Praveen Kumar said: If they are sent to jail, they will be exposed to hardcore criminals and get drawn to crime themselves. Besides, they will be shunned by society once they step out of the jail.

 Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department), said: Of the juvenile criminals, only a handful have the mental makeup of a hardened criminal. The rest, given a proper chance, can return to normal life.

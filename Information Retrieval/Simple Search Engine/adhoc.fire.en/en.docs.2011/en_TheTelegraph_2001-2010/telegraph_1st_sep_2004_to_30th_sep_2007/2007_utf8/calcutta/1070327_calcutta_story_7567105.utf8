 Womens empowerment

 Based on real-life incidents of women belonging to minority communities, Rangakarmees latest production, Khela Gadi, narrates the saga of women who are engaged in a relentless battle against adversity, both at home and outside. Among them is Zohra Bibi, a lady now in her 50s, whose life-struggles have made her a symbol of indomitable will-power and resilience. As fiction and reality merge, the play strings together stories of other women who have gathered round Zohra Bibis khela gadi (a van-rickshaw in which she ferries toys and other wares); stories that are strangely familiar to her own. As more women come forward to share their personal tragedies, Noor Bibi, also an entrepreneur in her own right like Zohra Bibi, urges others to break free from their shackles and be economically independent by being part of an autonomous womens commune. Direction: Usha Ganguli. Being staged on the occasion of World Theatre Day.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Khela Gadi, produced by Rangakarmee When: Today at 7 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts

 Sergeant rescues schoolgirl

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A friendly traffic sergeant helped a 12-year-old schoolgirl find her way back home on Wednesday afternoon, after she missed her bus and lost herself in Gariahat.

 Classes were over at noon, and the Class VI student of South Point School was waiting with her classmates for the school bus to arrive. 

 The bus arrived 10 minutes late and the girl dashed off to buy some chocolates, after leaving her schoolbag inside the vehicle. But the bus left without her.

 She returned after five minutes and was at her wits end when she couldnt find her school bus, said Bikash Chandra Bhandari, additional officer-in-charge, Gariahat police station.

 The girl was in tears as she sat on the pavement, unable to figure out what to do.

 As she didnt have enough money with her, she decided to walk home to Entally but lost her way in the crowd, said Bhandari.

 An hour later, Alok Sanyal, a sergeant attached to Gariahat police station out on patrol, noticed a large crowd near Patha Bhavan School. 

 I saw the girl sitting on the pavement and crying inconsolably. She didnt even respond when I asked about her whereabouts, said Sanyal. 

 The girl was too shocked at missing her school bus and had been left stranded, he recalled.

 The sergeant escorted her on his motorcycle to our police station, where our women colleagues spoke to her. We offered her biscuits and tried our best to make her comfortable, said Bhandari.

 She provided us her address only after a lot of persuasion, said the sergeant.

 The parents, who were frantically looking for the girl, had called up the school authorities and were considering going to the police, when Sanyal appeared at their Entally home with their daughter.

 The girls father, Chandrakanta Chatterjee, who works with a city-based private finance company, said had it not been for the police, my daughter would have been lost forever.

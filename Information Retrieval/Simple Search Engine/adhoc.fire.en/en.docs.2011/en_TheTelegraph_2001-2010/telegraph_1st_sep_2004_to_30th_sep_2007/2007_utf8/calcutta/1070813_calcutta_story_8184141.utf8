 About 100 children and their parents would have been hit if the explosion at McDonalds had occurred half an hour later. The kids were on their way to the Park Street restaurant to celebrate the birthday of a friend, a Class I student of La Martiniere for Boys, when it blew up. 

 Aditya Sharma, his son Atreyam and 10-month-old daughter were the nearest to the restaurant. I started early for the party, which was to begin at 10am. We were on Park Street and I was looking for a place to park. Suddenly, there was a tremendous sound. I saw two shutters fly across the street and crash into the parked cars, recalled Aditya.

 Atreyam started screaming in fear. I didnt waste a second. I took a U-turn and started calling up the parents of Atreyams friends while driving away. Thank God, none of the kids had reached McDonalds before the explosion, said Aditya, a resident of Labony, in Salt Lake.

 The birthday boy, who turned seven on Sunday, is in a state of shock. His parents, from Alipore, did not want the family to be identified. They were on their way to the restaurant when the explosion occurred. On hearing about it, they immediately returned home, said a family friend.

 After hectic phone calls, the party was held at the house of a friend of the boy in the neighbourhood. We spent a couple of hours there. All of us were discussing what would have happened if we had reached early. It was a sombre affair. The adults only had the blast on their mind, said Aditya. 

 McDonalds employees said they were preparing for the party. I had been asked to make the seating arrangements and so I was rushing to get to the restaurant, said a worker, who reached the outlet at 9.40am, six minutes after the blast.

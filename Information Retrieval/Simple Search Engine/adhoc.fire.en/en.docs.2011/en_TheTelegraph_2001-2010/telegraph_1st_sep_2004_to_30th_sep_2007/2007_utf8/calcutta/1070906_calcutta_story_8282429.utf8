 India on the move

 India is facing terrorist attacks with successive blasts 

 in Mumbai and Hyderabad. But the country is putting up a 

 fight against adversities. Indias gross domestic product 

 (GDP) has grown by 9.3 per cent. The question to be asked 

 is how India has fared in the 60 years of her independence? 

 This was the topic of the Subhrojit-Somak Memorial Annual Inter-School debate on August 31. This is the fifth year of the debate, held at Calcutta Boys High School in memory of two students of the school, Subhrojit and Somak, who had met with a bike accident on October 23, 2003. 

 The topic this year was After 60 years of independence, India has become a mature state in terms of peace, progress and prosperity. The participants, all students of Class XII, were from St James School, Don Bosco, Park Circus, La Martiniere for Boys (LMB), Our Lady Queen of the Missions School, Calcutta Girls High School, Modern High School and Calcutta Boys High School. M.P. Singh, vice-chancellor of National University of Judicial Sciences (NUJS), was the chief guest and Ruchira Goswami, senior lecturer of NUJS was the moderator. 

 Each participant was allotted three minutes to speak for or against the motion. The debate began with speaker Sujoy Chatterjee from the host school, speaking for the motion. He felt that though India has had many drawbacks in the last five decades it is to be taken as part of a learning curve. India being the fourth largest economy is an indicator of the progress it has made by setting her own standard, said Sujoy. 

 Speaking against the motion, Somrita Ganguly of Calcutta Girls School averred that India could not be a paradise considering the outbreaks of terrorism.

 The winners were students from Our Lady Queen of the Missions School, Torsa Chandra and Ipsa Kalra. Ipsa, the speaker against the motion identified the three Ps progress, peace and prosperity as poverty, petty politics and population. 

 The judges were renowned debater Utpal Chatterjee, Snehasish Sur and Subir Ghosh, the senior members of the Sanyal Trust.

 The Diary

 Nobodys Valentine

 The wrinkled skin, the countenance pale, 

 The trembling lips seem trying in vain

 To touch the moons silver light. 

 From the window of an old age home, a quivering hand stretches out. 

 Above, the moon looks down curiously. 

 Our wounded and hunger-stricken friends: 

 The lives of stray dogs thus begins, 

 They forage for food, thrashed and kicked at every corner, 

 Why does nobody spare a thought for them? 

 That day, I saw pain in the young ragpickers eyes, 

 A nameless future standing on lies. 

 In her tiny lap holding her naked brother, 

 Tears trickle down, she has no mother. 

 All three are stories of a cold nights wanting,

 Of aspiration, wants, and fear. 

 I wish all of them were my valentines, 

 To them go all my love and care.

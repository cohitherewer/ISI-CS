 Hunt for rowdy in UP death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The body of Fazlur Rahman alias Jahangir, a loan recovery agent and political worker from Kidderpore who was found dead beside railway tracks at Shikohabad in Uttar Pradesh last week, was brought to Calcutta on Tuesday evening. 

 There was tension in his locality from the morning. Supporters of Congress and Trinamul Congress took out separate rallies in the area demanding proper investigation into the 28-year-olds death. 

 We are sure that he was murdered. We will gherao Ekbalpore police station if the police fail to arrest the killers, said Mohammad Arman, a Congress supporter. 

 Jahangir went missing on September 6 along with local rowdy Chikna Raju, who also worked as a loan recovery agent. Raju is still missing. He and Jahangir were friends but had recently parted ways. Raids are on to nab him, said an officer of Ekbalpore police station.

 Jahangirs body was found lying beside the tracks about three km from Shikohabad railway station on Saturday afternoon. There were multiple injuries on his head, chest and legs. His hands were fractured.

 We are still awaiting the post-mortem report. The nature of his injuries indicated that he had either fallen off or had been thrown out of a moving train, an officer of Shikohabad police station had said.

 We found a bag containing two shirts and trousers. There was no railway ticket or mobile phone, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 After strike, extra flights

 - Rampant cancellations harass fliers as airport limps back to normal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Indian airline has announced several measures to cope up with the rush of passengers, following the withdrawal of the strike by its ground staff.

 The strike, called by Air Corporation Employees Union (ACEU) on Tuesday night, was called off around 3pm on Thursday.

 The airline said a special flight to Kathmandu has been scheduled for Friday, as the regular flight to the destination was cancelled for the second consecutive day on Thursday. Also scheduled for Friday is an extra flight to Port Blair. 

 Depending on demand, additional flights may be operated in other sectors, too, said an Indian spokesperson. We have also provided open tickets to passengers whose flights were cancelled due to the agitation but who still wanted to travel.

 Of the 24 Indian flights scheduled to leave Calcutta on Thursday, only eight took off. Two each flew to Delhi and Guwahati and one each to Silchar, Dimapur, Agartala, and Chennai.

 A flight each for Bangkok and Kathmandu, too, were cancelled.

 Of the 19 scheduled arrivals, 16 were cancelled. A flight each from Delhi, Bhubaneswar and Guwahati landed in Calcutta.

 A.S. Batra, an ONGC officer from Mumbai, summed up the harassment faced by the passengers. I was supposed to leave for Silchar yesterday, but the flight was cancelled. As advised by the authorities, I came again today, only to be told that the flight has been cancelled. The officials at the airline counter failed to answer my queries, he said.

 Among the hundreds stranded at the airport were 11 families from Bokaro, on their way to Port Blair. The 79 members of the group, including several children and women, looked hassled and exhausted. 

 We arrived here at 1.30am on Wednesday and are still not sure when we will be able to resume our journey. The airline should have taken care of our food and stay, said Rahimuddin Ansari, a member of the group.

 The CPM parliamentarian from Dum Dum, Amitava Nandi, visited the airport and spoke to the striking employees minutes before the agitation was called off. The employees will go back to work, since most of their demands have been met, Nandi said. 

 Samir Mandal, regional secretary of ACEU, said: The management has assured us that the suspension of the 12 employees in Calcutta will be withdrawn unconditionally.

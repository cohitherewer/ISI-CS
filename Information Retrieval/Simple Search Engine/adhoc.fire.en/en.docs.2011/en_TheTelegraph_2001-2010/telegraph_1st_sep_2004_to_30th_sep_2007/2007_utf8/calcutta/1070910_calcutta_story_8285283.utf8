 Pollution redress at Writers

 JAYANTA BASU

 A cell to register pollution-related complaints by the public started functioning at Writers Buildings on Friday. Complaints can be filed there every Friday, between 3pm and 5pm.

 The environment department recently ordered the constitution of a public grievance cell under senior law officer Biswajit Mukherjee. The cell is registering complaints in the public grievance department at Writers.

 There has been a public grievance wing at Writers for a long time though few approach it. As we received many complaints regarding environment hazards in the past few months, we have started a dedicated cell to address them, said environment secretary M.L. Meena.

 Mukherjee said the department receives about 50 complaints every month. The complaints at Writers may be addressed directly to the departmental secretary or the senior law officer.

 According to sources, the complaints beyond the purview of the cell would be redirected to the departments concerned. The cell will monitor the development of the cases.

 In case of an emergency, complaints can even be filed during the weekly sitting of the public grievance cell, said the senior law officer.

 It is a welcome move. But lack of infrastructure in the environment department may prove an impediment, said environment activist Subhas Dutta.

 Many environmentalists feel that the new green complaints monitoring cell is needed as the state pollution control boards public grievance redress system, which is more than a decade old, is not adequate. 

 Though several complaints against red category (highly polluting) units were dealt with last year, complaints against orange and green category industries are piling up at the green watchdogs headquarters in Salt Lake and other offices, said an environmentalist.

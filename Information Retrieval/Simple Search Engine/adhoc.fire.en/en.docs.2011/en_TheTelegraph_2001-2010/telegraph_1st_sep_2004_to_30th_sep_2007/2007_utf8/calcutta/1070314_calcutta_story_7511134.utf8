 Italian art is not so hot. Not as hot as Brit, American or German art. Prices of Italian contemporary art are not phenomenal, either. 

 But Italy has planned a constant exchange of art and artists with India. In the pipeline is a workshop of Indian artists in Italy, said art historian Lorenzo Canova, who curated On the edge of vision, New idioms in Indian amp; Italian contemporary art now on at the Victoria Memorial Hall. 

 The chubby 40-year-old, who studied at the University of Molise and looks more like an opera singer, was here till Monday, along with assistant curator Maria Cristina Bastante. In Italy, there is great interest in Indian art in Indian movies and fashion. Three important Italian artists Francesco Clemente, who lives in New York and visits India very often, Luigi Ontani and the late Alighiero Boetti, who worked in Afghanistan before the Russian invasion spent a lot of time in India, said Canova, who says he is not too sure he is descended from the famous sculptor.

 In the 1970s, there was a lot of interest in India and spirituality. Now, there is a resurgence of interest in the country among young people. Mixing creates new art in history. But there still remains a strong stamp of personality, said Canova.

 Maurizio Cannavacciuolo, one of the participants of the current exhibition, whose fine multi-layered works combining drawing and painting were one of the high points of the show, will conceptualise certain works, and these will be painted by Indian art students.

 At the end of this month, an exhibition of video art by Carlos Spadoni will be exhibited at Ficci-Frames hotel in Mumbai. Such is the melting pot of cultures that Canova thrives on.

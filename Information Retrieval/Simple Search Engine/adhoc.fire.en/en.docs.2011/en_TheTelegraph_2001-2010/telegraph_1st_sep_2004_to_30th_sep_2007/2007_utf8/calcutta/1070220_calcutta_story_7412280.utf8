 Fusion choreography

 Ranans productions are always situated at the intersection of a variety of impulses and responses. Chitra, its latest dance and theatre production, is inspired by Tagores Chitrangada. Its choreography rooted in Kathak, it also encounters Tagores poetic lyrics and music, historical and contemporary constructions of gender, along with imagery associated with Manipur, martial arts and music, relevant incidents from the Mahabharata and colonial memories of Calcutta rajbaris. Its action begins centuries after incidents narrated in Tagores Chitrangada. Chitra, eager to re-tell her story, finds herself thrust in a Manipur she can no longer recognise as her kingdom. The place frightens her, overwhelms her, scattering her history into mere fragments and dreams. The story transcends a specific time and space, meeting many images and echoes. The overall production design works towards an almost disembodied feel, incorporating elements of film, light-design and sound-scape. Direction: Vikram Iyengar. Concept and choreography: Debashree Bhattacharya and Vikram Iyengar.

 Event: A Kathak-based dance presentation by Ranan When: Today at 7 pm Where: Gyan Manch

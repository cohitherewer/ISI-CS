 You share your birthday with...

 MICHELLE RODRIGUEZ

 Your tendency to overlook details or be too accommodating creates problems.

 You understand how to budget others finances, but must learn how

 to do it better for yourself. Try developing your sixth-sense, but without

 letting your imagination go overboard. Be wary of lovers who exploit or

 take advantage of you. Maintain integrity and learn to be comfortable with

 yourself.

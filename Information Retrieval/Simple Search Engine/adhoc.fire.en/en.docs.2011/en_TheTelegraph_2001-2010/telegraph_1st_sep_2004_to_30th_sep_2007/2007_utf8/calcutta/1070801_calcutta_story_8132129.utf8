The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Teacher held for molestation 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A music teacher in a reputed English-medium girls school in central Calcutta was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly assaulting and molesting a colleague.

 Prosenjit Mandal was held at his Lenin Sarani residence, where he lives with his parents, on the basis of a complaint lodged by the woman, in her late 20s, with Taltala police station. 

 She alleged that Mandal accosted her on SN Banerjee Road around 9pm. He assaulted and molested me on the road, she stated in her complaint.

 Deputy commissioner (headquarters) Gyanwant Singh said Mandal was produced in Sealdah court and granted bail. 

 According to police, the two teachers of the century-old school knew each other for the past couple of years. The woman said Mandal, whose father is also a teacher in a missionary school, had started disturbing her in the teachers room about two months ago.

 She told us that she had informed the other teachers about his advances. But no action was taken. After she stopped talking to Mandal, he had become desperate to interact with her, said an officer of Taltala police station.

 The other teachers, however, said they were unaware of the problems between the two.

 The complainant told the police that she had gone to Taltala in the evening to provide private tuition to a student. She was returning to her uncles Entally house, where she lives, along SN Banerjee Road. Her parents stay in Baruipur, in South 24-Parganas.

 Mandal asked me to stop. I tried to ignore him and walk on, but he caught my hands. When I tried to free myself, he slapped me, she said in the complaint. 

 The woman cried out for help as soon as Mandal tried to exert force on her. But he managed to flee before the pedestrians and local residents could come to her rescue, added the officer.

 She immediately returned to her residence and narrated the incident to her uncle and aunt. They went to the police station and lodged the complaint.

 Mandal denied the allegations and claimed that he had an affair with the woman. His claim, however, has nothing to do with the allegations against him, said Singh.

 The principal of the school refused to comment on the matter, pointing out that it had happened outside the school premises.

 The school has nothing to do with the personal matters of the teachers. The managing committee of the school will decide whether action will be taken against the two, said school principal.

 The guardians were dismayed by the incident. If teachers of such a reputed institution set an example like this, what will the children learn. It is the responsibility of the teachers to maintain an atmosphere conducive to learning in school, said Rita Dutta, whose daughter studies in the institution.

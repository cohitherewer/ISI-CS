 Companies on campus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Corporate firms for the first time will be invited to Intaglio, the annual meet organised by Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta.

 We are opening up the competitive events of Intaglio to corporate firms from across the world as student participants will learn a lot from them, said Arun K., a second-year student of the institute and a member of the Intaglio organising team. The participation of corporate firms will the raise the bar on competition.

 Every winter, budding managers from premier B-schools local and global swoop down on the Joka campus to test their mettle in marketing, finance, strategy and consultation.

 Intaglio 2008, scheduled to be held from January 4 to 6, will feature five expositions on marketing (Selling Point), finance (Finesse), operations (Optimum), strategy (Stratagem) and systems (Domain).

 The usual crowd-pullers such as Wizards of Biz (a business simulation challenge), Electrisk (a mutual fund game), Modulus (data modelling) and Blueprint (preparing a business plan) are also on the list.

 The number of online games is being increased, with the introduction of items on market research and mergers and acquisitions.

 The idea of online games is to give the participants a taste of Intaglio before they participate in the events, said Deepak H., the media coordinator for the meet.

 The institute has also entered into knowledge partnerships with foreign universities, including a few Ivy League schools, for the expositions.

 The tie-ups will not only help us plan and execute the events better but will also result in wider participation of international institutes in Intaglio, pointed out Deepak.

 Last year, Intaglio participants included Harvard Business School, National University of Singapore and Indian School of Business.

 The registration for the three-day meet starts in mid-September.

 Hope for stranded woman

 Barao Abdul: Ministry nod 

 Barao Abdul can at last hope to meet her family in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). 

 The Union ministry of external affairs (MEA) has received a go-ahead from the state government to issue a council access to Pakistan high commission.

 With the nod, Pakistani consulate officials in Delhi can visit Barao at NRS Medical College and Hospital and identify her, so that she can be sent back to her hometown.

 Thirty-year-old Barao, who claims to be from Balgaon, in Harchoyal district of PoK, was found unconscious near Contai on the Calcutta-Digha road on April 27 last year. 

 Local residents admitted her to the sub-divisional hospital. The doctor who treated Barao in Contai referred her to NRS Hospital on May 16 that year. Barao was admitted to the psychiatric department of NRS on August 28, 2006. Since then, she has been languishing in the hospital. 

 The Pakistan high commission in New Delhi, though aware of Baraos plight, cannot visit her in Calcutta without the MEAs consent. For months, the MEA had been dilly-dallying over the issue.

 Recently, the state home secretary received a letter, dated May 18, 2007, from Asim Khurana, MEA joint secretary, seeking a detailed report on Baraos stay in Contai and Calcutta. In his letter, Khurana had written that President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had taken note of her plight and asked the state government to furnish the report. 

 The state government asked the East Midnapore police superintendent to probe the issue and send a report. 

 The investigation was conducted by Kalyan Chatterjee, deputy superintendent of police of the district intelligence branch. The report was sent to Prasad Ranjan Roy, principal secretary (home affairs), on May 22, 2007. It was forwarded to the state foreigners department, which probed Baraos stay at NRS.

 The report has been sent to the MEA. They can now issue the council access to the Pakistan high commission in New Delhi, an official of the foreigners department said.

 A city-based legal aid organisation had moved a petition in Calcutta High Court, seeking permission to become Baraos legal guardian.

 She requires a surgery to remove stones from her gall bladder. But there is nobody to sign her risk bond. 

 The Legal Aid Services of West Bengal has sought an order directing the hospital to waive the risk bond stipulation for Barao. The doctors attending to her have decided to go ahead with the pre-surgical tests, so the operation is not delayed if and when the clearance comes.

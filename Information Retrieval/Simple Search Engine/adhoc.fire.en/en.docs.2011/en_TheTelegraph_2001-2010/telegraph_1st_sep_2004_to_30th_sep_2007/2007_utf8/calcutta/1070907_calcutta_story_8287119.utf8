The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 They will walk and they will talk but do little to save our children

 OUR BUREAU

 The government and the principal Opposition party chose Thursday to stir from their slumber over the alarming death count on the city streets. And their delayed reactions were most predictable one vague and the other violent; one based on deliberation and the other on disruption.

 Metro turns the spotlight on what the transport minister and the Trinamul Congress chief said on Thursday about how unsafe the Calcutta roads were and what they proposed to do about it.

 GOVERNMENT

 Around 2.30pm on Thursday, Subhas Chakraborty gave the cry for safer city streets a national twist by calling for a cross-country awareness campaign about road safety.

 Unless serious awareness is generated about the issue, its not possible to tackle this problem. Look at the way educated people in business suits cross the roads in Calcutta. How can any bus driver or truck driver take responsibility for such irresponsible pedestrians? he demanded.

 In 2006, there were 1.14 lakh road deaths in India, compared to 103 deaths caused by pneumonia and 200 by HIV. But the government is spending crores on combating the other problems while ignoring road safety, said Chakraborty, adding that he had written to the Prime Minister about this.

 The state government will hold a seminar later this month and launch a massive campaign next month to generate awareness about the problem, said Chakraborty.

 Claiming that most road mishaps in Bengal occurred in the districts on national highways, he said seizing the licence of a driver was of no use, as fake licences were easily available in Bihar.

 Readerspeak: This is so typical of the government blaming everything from the national highways to Bihar to pedestrians, but refusing to take any responsibility for the blood on our streets.... The transport minister will chair farcical seminars, while our children are crushed under killer wheels.

 OPPOSITION

 Around 3.15pm on Thursday, Mamata Banerjee instructed Trinamuls youth wing to hit the streets on Friday to spread the word about how government ineptitude was at the root of the spate of road mishaps.

 Why are all those traffic awareness weeks organised? Bus drivers are killing people and the government is sitting back and watching. Every second day, children are being crushed by killer wheels. I have asked Trinamul supporters to hold a rally tomorrow and organise demonstrations at major points across the city to expose how the police-bus union nexus is playing havoc with our lives, thundered Mamata.

 Trinamul Youth Congress president Madan Mitra announced that a meeting would be held at Esplanade on Friday. We will go to the people with this issue. Lives are being lost and the transport minister is a mere onlooker. He doesnt have the guts to initiate action against bus drivers and unions. And the home minister (Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee) has no control over the police, Mitra added.

 Readerspeak: The Opposition should play a constructive role to try and stop the loss of lives on our streets. Such demonstrations and rallies will only add to the traffic chaos and cause harassment to the common man. Instead, why dont they take up the task of educating bus and auto drivers owing allegiance to Trinamul-led unions?

 Duo dies in septic tank 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Two civic workers were killed and another man was taken ill while cleaning a septic tank in Baranagar on Tuesday. 

 A preliminary investigation revealed that Yamuna Hari, 35, who worked in the conservancy department of Baranagar Municipality, and Durga Hari, 30, an employee in the same department of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, died of suffocation. The civic bodies had not engaged them for the job. They were doing the work for Rs 1,200. 

 The duo, along with 27-year-old Babla, started to clean the septic tank in a Kalicharan Ghosh Road house around 1.30 pm on Tuesday. We received information that two men were trapped inside a septic tank for a long time. They were brought out and taken to hospital, where they were declared dead, said superintendent of North 24-Parganas police Praveen Kumar.

 According to neighbours, chemicals used for polishing ornaments in a factory on the ground floor of the house had flown into the septic tank, creating the gas that killed the two.

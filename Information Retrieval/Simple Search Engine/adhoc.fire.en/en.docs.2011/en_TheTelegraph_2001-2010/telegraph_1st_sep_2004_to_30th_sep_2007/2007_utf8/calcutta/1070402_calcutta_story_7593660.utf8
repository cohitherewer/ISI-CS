 Kidnap case revived

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Moved by the plight of a pavement-dweller, the CID has opened a five-month-old case, which officers of Jadavpur police station had closed without conducting a proper inquiry. 

 Promising Rs 200 for an advertising film shoot, a man, later identified as Pinaki Roy, had approached Purnima Gosain and asked her to fetch her three-month-old son Arun near Jadavpur University. 

 The man took my son into the compound. I waited outside. But they did not return, said Purnima, who went to the CID headquarters in Bhabani Bhavan last Friday and met Sanjay Mukherjee, deputy inspector-general of police (special).

 According to Purnima, when she had lost all hope of getting her son back, she bumped into Pinaki near Gariahat last month. As she held on to him and raised an alarm, bystanders gathered and handed Pinaki over to Gariahat police station. He was later sent to Jadavpur police station. 

 Though he was arrested, police did nothing and the man was out on bail after a few days, Purnima, who lives under a shade on Ballygunge Circular Road, reportedly told Mukherjee. 

 According to CID officials, Jadavpur police station did not show any interest in the case. They did not even ask for Pinakis police custody, which they should have done, as the boy is still missing, said a CID official. 

 Now, we will interrogate him and move court for taking him in our custody, he added.

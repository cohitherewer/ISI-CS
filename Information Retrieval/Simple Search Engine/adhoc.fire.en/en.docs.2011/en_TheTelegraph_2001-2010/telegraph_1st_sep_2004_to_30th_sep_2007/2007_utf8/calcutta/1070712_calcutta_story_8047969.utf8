 A group of CPM supporters shot at an activist of the party from a rival faction at Darapara, in Topsia, on Wednesday while he was taking his three-year-old daughter home from school.

 Abdul Karim, 30, alias Sheikh Raja, was shot on both legs and a third bullet missed his head. The seven assailants had come on three motorcycles. One of them struck Raja on the head with the butt of his revolver and the others hurled bombs before fleeing.

 Local residents took Raja to National Medical College and Hospital, where the bullets were removed after surgery. His condition is stable.

 We have identified the assailants and raids are being conducted to round them up, said the deputy commissioner of the detective department, Ajoy Kumar. 

 The shooting took place around 11.15am while Raja was riding home with his daughter on a motorcycle. The seven blocked his way near Shibtala Math and dragged him off the two-wheeler. A gang member then flung the child to a side of the road.

 Raja started screaming for help. Some local residents rushed in but did not dare to intervene after seeing the revolvers, bombs and choppers in the hands of the seven. They hurled five bombs before fleeing the spot, said an investigating officer of Topsia police station. Raja lay on the road, writhing in pain, for 15 minutes before the locals took him to hospital.

According to police, the assailants were Sheikh Jumman, Sheikh Rahmat, Sheikh Sahabaz, Sheikh Mannan, Sohail, Kelu and Sheikh Alam. 

 The gang was led by Alam and all the members are residents of Topsia and Entally. Raja would have soon become a local committee member of the party. His rival faction did not like his increasing clout within the party, stated another officer. 

 The police have alerted all the adjacent thanas and raids are being conducted to arrest the gang members. 

 The motive of the attackers was not to kill Raja but to teach him a lesson. The rivals were not happy with his popularity, added the officer.

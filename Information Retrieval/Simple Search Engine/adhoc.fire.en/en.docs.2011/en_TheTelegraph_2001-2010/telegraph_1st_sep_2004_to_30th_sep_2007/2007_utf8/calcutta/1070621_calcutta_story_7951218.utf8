The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 New thrust to light rail transit project

 A STAFF REPORTER

The state government is trying to put the light rail transit (LRT) and the East-West Metro project on the fast track.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will soon write to Union urban development minister Jaipal Reddy, seeking the inclusion of the LRT project under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya on Wednesday.

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb will go to Delhi to actively pursue the project, said the minister. He was speaking after a meeting with transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury and Deb on the project.

 The Union ministry has agreed to consider the project but has raised a number of questions regarding the passenger-carrying capacity of the LRT and the integration of the project with other modes of transport.

 The Centre is expected to fund 35 per cent of the project and the state 15 per cent. The rest of the money will come from a private partner.

 In tenders floated by the transport department, Czech company Amex International had emerged the highest bidder. The company plans to tie up with SREI for funding.

 The state government is also working to obtain the Japanese governments approval for the East-West Metro. It will rope in environmental experts to reply to queries by the Japan Bank for International Cooperations (JBIC) screening committee. 

 The committee wants to know how the government will deal with issues like dust pollution, noise pollution and removal of refuse from the stations. It also needs to know about the governments preparedness regarding soil erosion and natural disasters.

 The Japanese agency has raised questions about social aspects of the project and its infrastructure. There are around 118 shops, 227 houses and a school along the proposed route. The JBIC has sought to know what form of rehabilitation we are working out, said a senior government official.

 The agency also wants to know about the underground drainage system, groundwater facilities and waste-water recycling plans.

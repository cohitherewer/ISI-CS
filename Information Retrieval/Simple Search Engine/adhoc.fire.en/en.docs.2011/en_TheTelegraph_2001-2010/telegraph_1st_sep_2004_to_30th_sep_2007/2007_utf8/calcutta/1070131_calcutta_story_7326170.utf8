 SANJAY MANDAL

A sprawling, new-look lounge; more check-in counters at domestic and international terminals; more immigration counters with automated passport-reading machines; conveyor belts with in-built X-ray machines; more parking bays for planes Calcutta airport is all set for a makeover.

 The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has drawn up a Rs 120-crore plan for the overhaul. Our aim is to increase the handling capacity of the airport, as the demand has grown over the years, said airport director V.K. Monga.

 Heres a recce of the proposed changes: 

 CANOPY: To increase lounge space, a canopy is being built from one end of the domestic terminal to the other. Spanning over 2,650 sq m, it will be erected in three phases. The first phase is ready and will be made operational this week.

 COUNTERS: With an increasing number of airlines flying into Calcutta, 12 more check-in counters have been set up at the domestic terminal. Another two are coming up. Once ready, the number of check-in counters in the domestic terminal will go up to 42. Three more cash counters will also come up next week.

 A computer programme Common User Terminal Equipment will be installed in the counters to enable passengers to check in at any of them according to their convenience.

 Six more counters will be set up in the international terminal, which already has 26.

 Four immigration counters have come up, taking the count to 22. The counters will be armed with automated passport-reading machines.

 FLOORING: The 1.5 lakh-sq-ft floor in the domestic lounge has been relaid to give it a smarter look.

 CONVEYOR BELTS: A conveyor belt has been installed in the departure zone, taking the count to four. They will soon be fitted with X-ray scanners. The authorities also plan to instal an imported conveyor belt in the arrival zone.

 SECURITY: To avoid congestion in the security hold on the ground floor, five X-ray machines will be installed in two security holds on the first floor. Installation of X-ray machines will allow optimum utilisation of the first-floor security hold. 

 The AAI has sought additional deployment of CISF men in this zone.

 An additional escalator will be installed to help passengers reach the two security check counters upstairs without any inconvenience.

 BACK OFFICES: A dedicated back office has been set up to help the airlines. The newly-built, two-storeyed structure in the domestic terminal, near the departure zone, is spread over 5,000 sq ft. The airlines are using the building for administrative work.

 BAYS: Six more parking bays will be created for planes.

 RETIRING ROOMS: Another eight retiring rooms will be set up in the next three months.

 CARGO BUILDING: An integrated international cargo building and a state-of-the-art complex for perishable cargo will be commissioned in June. 

 The cargo complex, covering 20,000 sq m, will have a capacity to handle 40,000 metric tonnes of cargo. 

 The air-conditioned complex for perishable cargo is coming up on a 600-sq-m plot.

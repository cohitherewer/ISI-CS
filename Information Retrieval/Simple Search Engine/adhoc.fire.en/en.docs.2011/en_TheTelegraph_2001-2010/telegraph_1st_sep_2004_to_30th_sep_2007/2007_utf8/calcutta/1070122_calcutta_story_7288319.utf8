The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Stage set for a creative cradle

 - REGIONAL THEATRE SCHOOLS

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 The stage is set for a National School of Drama (NSD) theatre school in Calcutta. The theatre training institution, dating back to 1959, has convinced Delhi to include the opening of regional theatre schools in the next Five-Year Plan.

 This was announced by Devendra Raj Ankur, director of NSD, at the inauguration ceremony of Bharat Rangmahotsav at Rabindra Sadan. Initially, five schools will be opened in five states, including Bengal, Manipur and Karnataka.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee welcomed the move, as such a centre would add to the cultural canvas of Calcutta.

 The proposal has been welcomed by theatre practitioners around the country who are convinced that just one drama school where the language is primarily Hindi cannot encompass the diversity of regional theatre traditions.

 Theatre actor Prasanna had even gone on a hunger strike on January 6 to try and convince the Karnataka government to open a national-level drama school for the region.

 In Calcutta, sporadic attempts have been made to open a full-fledged academy for Bengali theatre. Playwright-director Manoj Mitra recalls that in 2001, as professor of the Rabindra Bharati University drama department, he had steered talks with NSD to open an academy in Calcutta, but to little avail. With so much theatre activity and young people taking up theatre as profession, such an academy can provide the much needed technical grounding, said Mitra.

 Samik Bandyopadhyay, vice-chairman of NSD, however, has reservations. It is true that such an academy is urgently needed, as it is not possible for everyone to go to Delhi for the three-year diploma course. But we dont need an NSD Delhi clone with the same syllabus. Theatre is so language and culture-specific that an understaffed organisation like NSD cannot handle it alone; we need local actors, directors, technicians, scholars, and also the state to play a substantial role in the project, he affirms.

 Once adopted, the project would take at least a year to materialise. Bangalore has been chosen for the Karnataka centre as an NSD Regional Resource Centre already exists and Imphal will be the Manipur centre, where work on a similar infrastructure started two years ago. The regional centres will initially have a three-year course, with final-year exposure in Delhi. The admission criteria could be lowered from graduation to Higher Secondary to catch talent young, said Bandyopadhyay.

 Menace of marriage mandaps 

 Save My Space 

 The problem 

 The row of marriage houses on Ballygunge Circular Road approaching Ballygunge Phari has become a menace for the residents from November to March, the peak season for marriages. 

 The pollution

 The number of marriage houses in the short stretch between Dover Road crossing and Deodar Street crossing has suddenly increased, with at least five premises being rented out frequently.

 As all the marriages that take place in these buildings involve very rich people, almost all the invitees come in their cars and many of them park these along the roads on both sides and even on the footpath, thus completely throwing the traffic out of gear (never mind that the parking is illegal).

 As a result the road, an arterial one in south Calcutta with a high degree of traffic density, becomes choked with immobile vehicles. 

 The toxic fumes that result from incomplete combustion of fuel as a result of this stop-go-stop traffic affect our health. Even walking on the footpath becomes impossible with the vehicles being parked on it. We are subjected to unending honking by the cars till late evening.

 The noise of the premises being cleaned up continues till late at night. It is also common for morning-walkers to find large amounts of leaves and other material used for decorating the marriage mandaps the night before being burnt in the open with complete disregard for public health.

 Who cares?

 We have heard that the state pollution control board has certain norms about the marriage houses. But the board officials asked us to go to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation when we approached them. The municipal authorities said traffic is under the jurisdiction of police.

 There is a Ballygunge police station outpost a short distance away from the marriage houses. It is meant to serve the local people in an emergency, but the policemen seem more interested in serving the cause of marriage parties! By the by, their dinners also come from the marriage parties.

 We dont know which authority to approach with the problem now.

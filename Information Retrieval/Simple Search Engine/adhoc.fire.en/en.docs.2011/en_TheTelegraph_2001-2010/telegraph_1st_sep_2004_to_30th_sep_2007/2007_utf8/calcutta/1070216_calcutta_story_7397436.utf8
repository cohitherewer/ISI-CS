 Police have blamed the mishap on Red Road late on Wednesday that killed two cops and left three injured on rash driving.

 The mishap occurred when a truck rammed into a Radio Flying Squad jeep on patrol duty. The truck driver, Bhim Paswan, who has been arrested, claimed he had been dazzled by the headlights of the jeep, but police accused him of rash driving.

 Paswan and his help, Bashir Khan, fled after the accident, but were traced to RG Kar Hospital. Both were injured in the collision.

 Rubbishing Paswans claim, deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim said the driver of a truck is perched high enough not to get blinded by the headlights of a jeep.

 An officer of the traffic departments fatality squad said the truck had crossed the dividing line and entered the wrong channel. As the driver slammed the brakes after hitting the jeep, the front wheels came off, he added.

 While jeep driver C.R. Dubey and constable Tapan Roy died on the spot, sergeant Milan Dey and constables Shanti Kumar Pal and Rabindranath Roy were injured. Dubey and Roy were presented a guard of honour at Police Training School.

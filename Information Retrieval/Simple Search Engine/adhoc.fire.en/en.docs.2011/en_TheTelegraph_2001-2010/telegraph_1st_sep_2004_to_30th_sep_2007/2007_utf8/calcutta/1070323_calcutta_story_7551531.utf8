 Creatures of the countryside

 Most modern artists can be found shaping their works with a focus on urban sensibilities. Dhaneshwar Shah, a young artist from New Delhi, stands apart in this respect. A naturally-gifted artist, his works are experimental with a strong graphic quality. With a mature rationale that belies his years, he has developed a powerful, evocative, visual language that appeals to the senses. Coloured Spaces, the ongoing solo exhibition of his works, features paintings based on the life and habitat of Bastar, a place he visited recently. Colourful and vivacious in appearance, the harshness of Bastars landscape seems, nevertheless, to have created a sharp impact on the artists psyche. Images and motifs from the animal kingdom abound in his works. As such horses, dogs, cats, ducks, deer, goats and peacocks appear to be the central protagonists of his paintings.

 Event: Solo exhibition of paintings by Dhaneshwar Shah When: Till March 28; 11 am - 7 pm (Sunday, 2 pm - 7 pm) Where: Mon Art Gallerie, 6 Hungerford Street, Regency, 3rd floor

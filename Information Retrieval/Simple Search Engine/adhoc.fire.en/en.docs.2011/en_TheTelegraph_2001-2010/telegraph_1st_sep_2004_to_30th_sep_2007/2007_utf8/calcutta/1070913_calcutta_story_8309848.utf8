 Cop in-laws surrender

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four in-laws of Calcutta police sub-inspector Jyotsna Das were granted bail on Wednesday after they surrendered before the additional chief judicial magistrates court in Alipore.

 On September 7, nine months pregnant Jyotsna was allegedly beaten up by her mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sisters-in-law, one of their husbands and a nephew in her Tiljala house.

 She had almost fainted when her husband Shyamal arrived and took her to hospital. She was admitted in the intensive care unit. 

 In the FIR, Jyotsna had named her mother-in-law Saraswati, brother-in-law Babla, sisters-in-law Arpita Saha and Parul De and Paruls husband Ajay. Babla had been arrested earlier and granted bail. The other four surrendered on Wednesday.

 Shyamal said Jyotsna was recovering gradually. We shall be free of anxiety after she recovers and delivers a healthy baby, he said.

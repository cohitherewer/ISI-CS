 Leaping flames engulfed an illegal plastic factory on Sashibhusan Mukherjee Road, in Behala, on Friday morning, giving the residents of the densely-populated area a scare. The factory was gutted but there were no casualties. Some houses were damaged.

 Our building was like a furnace by 7.15 am. My daughter was still in bed with her four-and-a-half-month-old child. We could have been roasted, said Pratul Mukherjee, who lives next to the factory. 

 The employees work till very late. I have repeatedly requested them to stop working at night, but they hardly pay attention, he added. 

 Some of the buildings in the area have developed cracks as a result of the heat. The flames rose so high that the water tank on the second-floor of a house has sprung a leak. 

 Five tenders took nearly four hours to control the blaze. There were no injuries, said fire brigade officials. According to them, the fire may have been caused by a short circuit.

 District police superintendent S.N. Gupta said he has asked the local police station to probe the incident. Bikram Dalmia purchased the factory a few months ago. We will see if it was being run according to the rules, he said.

 Narendra Nath Mondal, a security guard of the factory, said he had alerted two of the employees, who were still working, on seeing the flames. 

 Trinamul Congress councillor and borough chairperson Ratna Sur stated: As far as I know, Dalmia had not renewed the trade licence. He was drawing water and electricity illegally. 

 She added that a number of factories in the area, including some processing hazardous chemicals, are running illegally. Such factories should not be allowed to run in a residential area. I will find out if the establishments have obtained clearances from the pollution control board and the fire brigade, Sur said.

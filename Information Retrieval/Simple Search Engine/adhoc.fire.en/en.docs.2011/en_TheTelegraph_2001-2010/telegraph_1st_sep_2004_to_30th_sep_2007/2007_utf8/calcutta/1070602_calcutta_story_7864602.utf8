 The fire at Mazdur Colony, in Topsia, on Friday morning gutted more than 500 shanties. It took five hours and 25 fire tenders to douse the blaze.

 A dozen residents, including three women, were injured. Four fire brigade officers were admitted to hospital with injuries.

 The residents put up a roadblock on the EM Bypass and set ablaze a tender. Alleging that the fire brigade had arrived late, a mob damaged a police van and a civic car.

 A Rapid Action Force team was deployed. The police had to resort to a lathicharge to disperse the mob.

 The cause of the fire has not yet been ascertained. It could have started in a kitchen, said a fire brigade official.

 The blaze was first noticed at 10.40am. Within half an hour, shanties on a 1.5-km stretch along the canal that flows by the colony were on fire.

 The fire spun out of control because of the nature of the goods stored in the shanties. Most of the residents are ragpickers and they used to store inflammable goods like plastic bottles, gloves and syringes. Moreover, country liquor used to be manufactured in some of the shanties. Drums of lubricating oil were kept in a handful of them, said a fire brigade official.

 I was resting in my room when the blaze started. I came out and saw fire on all sides. I hardly got a chance to save my belongings, said Rahim Sheikh, whose home has been reduced to ashes.

 Ayesha Bewa suffered the same fate. I have lost everything. If no one helps, I have no alternative but to starve with my husband from tomorrow, she said.

 Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee visited the area and distributed clothes and food among the victims.

 Mayoral council member (sewerage and drainage) Farzana Chowdhury, who also visited the spot, said: We have made arrangements for the relief of the families affected by the fire.

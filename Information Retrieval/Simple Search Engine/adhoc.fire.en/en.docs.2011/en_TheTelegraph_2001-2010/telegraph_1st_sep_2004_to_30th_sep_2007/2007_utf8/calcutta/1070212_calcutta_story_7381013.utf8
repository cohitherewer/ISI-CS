The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Christina Ricci

 You are adventurous and always ready for something new and exciting. You live life to the fullest. You have it in you to inspire your team. Although you are ambitious, you will never trample on anyone to get your way. Being high up does not excite you as much as love for work. You are always ready to extend a helping hand to a near and dear one.

 Kusum Bhandari

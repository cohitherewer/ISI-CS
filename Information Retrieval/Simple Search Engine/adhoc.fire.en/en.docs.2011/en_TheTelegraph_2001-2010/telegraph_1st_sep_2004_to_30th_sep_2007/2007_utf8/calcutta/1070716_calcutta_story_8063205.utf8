 Tease protest sets jawan on rampage 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A man in uniform assumed the role of tormentor in tech town on Sunday afternoon. Unleashing terror near Nayapatty market, on the road leading to New Town from Salt Lake, he rained kicks on a middle-aged woman and then proved his might by smashing 15 roadside kiosks.

 Selva Raj, a driver in 3rd signal Battalion of CRPF, lost his cool after a woman Sushama raised her voice against his indecent behaviour. 

 He was standing at a paan shop next to our small garment store. My wife, along with her two sisters, was attending to customers. The jawan winked at them and then tried to get fresh with them by asking them for a matchbox, said Mukunda Dhali, husband of Sushama.

 According to him, the jawan got infuriated when Sushama asked him to behave himself and leave the spot.

 He was drunk and he repeatedly kicked my wife, added Dhali, a small-time trader, who had to rush his wife to Bidhannagar sub-divisional hospital after Sushama complained of a nagging pain in her abdomen. She was released on Sunday night after first aid. 

 Rajs act triggered strong protests from shop-owners of Nayapatti market and they demanded an explanation from him.

 He abused us and said whatever he did was right. He jumped into the water tanker which he was driving and ploughed down our shops. All this while, he kept on repeating that we could do nothing to him, said Joydeb Naskar, a member of the shop-owners committee of the market.

 Leaving the infuriated shopkeepers behind, he sped off to the battalion enclave barely one-and-a-half km from the market and entered the quarters.

 We are poor shop-owners. We want the CRPF to take appropriate action against him and compensate us for the losses, added Naskar, who, along with fellow traders, went to the CRPF quarters to file a complaint against Selva Raj. 

 Senior officers at the CRPF office promptly reacted to the complaint and suspended five jawans after the Sunday mornings incident. 

 We have suspended Selva Raj for his act and four other jawans, posted at the gate, for allowing him to leave the enclave without an escort vehicle, which is a norm, said A.K. Singh, a spokesperson for CRPF.

 The authorities have also initiated a departmental inquiry into the matter. 

 We have registered a case based on reports of the incident. We are getting in touch with the senior officers of CRPF and will take stern action against the guilty, said an officer of Bidhannagar (east) police station.

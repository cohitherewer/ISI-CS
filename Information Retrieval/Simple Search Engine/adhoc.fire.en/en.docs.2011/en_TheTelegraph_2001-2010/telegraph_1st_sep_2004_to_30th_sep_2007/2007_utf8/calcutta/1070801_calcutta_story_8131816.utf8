 CU girl hangs herself

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 21-year-old postgraduate student of psychology committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling of her bedroom in her Jagabandhu Dey Road residence, in Sealdah, on Monday night.

 According to preliminary investigation, Amrita Dey, a student of Calcutta University, did not want to marry the man her parents had selected for her. It appears that she had an affair with another person and the parents were opposed to their marriage, said an officer of Muchipara police station.

 Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner (headquarters), said the suicide was detected around 10pm. She had dinner with her family members as usual and then locked herself in her room, playing music at a high volume. Her father Arun Dey knocked on the door, but there was no response.

 An officer of Muchipara police station said: The family members broke the door open to find Amrita hanging from ceiling. She was rushed to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where she was declared dead.No suicide note was found.

 After interrogating the family members, the police believe that Amrita was suffering from depression.

 She had even stopped talking to her parents, added the officer.

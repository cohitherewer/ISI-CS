 Citu men in policeman assault

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A mob of alleged Citu men assaulted the officer-in-charge of Baguiati traffic guard and took off his cap on Sunday morning, after he dared to impound a taxi whose driver is loyal to the CPM-backed trade union.

 The mob was allegedly led by Avijit Singha, but he was not arrested as a section of Citu leaders from Rajarhat pressured senior officers to settle the case amicably.

 The problem arose when officer Manik Lal Ganguly was clearing traffic on VIP Road to make way for the convoys of the governor and finance minister, who were returning from the airport after meeting Pranab Mukherjee. The injured external affairs minister was being flown to Delhi.

 While most vehicles drove away, Ganguly noticed some taxis parked on the road. He ordered the drivers to move, but one of them, Bhola Roy, refused. The officer impounded his taxi.The situation worsened after Bhola contacted Singha, said an officer. 

 Praveen Kumar, superintendent of North 24-Parganas police, said he would comment after ascertaining the details.

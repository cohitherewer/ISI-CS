 Moments frozen in time

 Fascinated by myth, magic and colour since his childhood, Indranil Senguptas love affair with the lens began with his experiments with his fathers camera. With time, his childhood fantasies were refined and transformed by his experiences. Yet, he retained an intrinsic fondness for magic and mystery in the activities of daily life. A search for the abstract dominated his imagination, finding its best expression in the raw beauty of nature. In Search of Sublime, the ongoing maiden solo exhibition of his photographs, captures moments that define his endless quest; a quest that takes him from a seaside village to the land of the clouds, from the ruins of Hampi to the monastery of Kianzing and from Tagores Santiniketan to the barren lands of the Thar.

 Event: Photographs by Indranil Sengupta When: Till September 10; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts, New South Gallery (B)

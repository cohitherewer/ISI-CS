 Currency of touch

 In the age of eBay, an ancient form of trading persists. The mode: live auction. The commodity: goats. In Calcutta, the traders at Rajabazar and Munshiganj in Kidderpore sell goats through nilami or auction. More than 10,000 goats are sold in a day at the 200-year-old Rajabazar bakri mandi. The market starts at 6pm and continues till 2am daily. 

 The traders vouch for the efficacy of the system. They have a special way of communicating with the buyer using the language of touch. The dealer covers his palm with a gamchha or a piece of cloth. And he asks the buyer to touch his fingers indicating how much the latter is willing to pay. A base price is given to the buyer. If the price suits the trader, the deal is done. No customer knows how much we are charging others. So, we are free to control the price, says a trader. 

 The goats that are sold are delivered in the morning. Most of the supply comes from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan where these mandis are very common, quot; says Sheikh Anwar Hussain, another trader. Supplies also come from north Bengal. 

 Rajabazar never goes to sleep. Its just that the stench from the muck and goat excreta also flows freely 24x7.

 Mall talk: Youngsters hanging out at City Centre

 Shopping malls are the place to check out the other sex. For this is where the citys coolest and prettiest faces hang out. The problem is that courage may fail. But theres a solution: after spotting her (or him) at the mall, go online. At least thats what two red-blooded young men have done on a City Centre community. A lady comes every day in a black top and jeans. She smokes at the hangout. Have you seen her? reads one scrap. The other young man is worried about the state of his heart. He fears he may be running out of time and luck? Is he going away? Is she going away? Is any of them getting married? The scrap only mentions the girls name, the name she knows him by, and the fact that she is an old friend he hasnt met for ages. Only you can help me, the scrap pleads: I am dying to meet her.

 Unfortunately, there are no replies as yet. 

 A four anna theatre 

 Up in Smoke: A jatra actor takes a break. (Reuters) 

 In May 1840, the penny theatres of London were observed making a quiet entry into the citys theatrical map.

 On Saturday, April 25, 1840, the English language newspapers in Calcutta received a flood of letters from a furious sender who identified himself as A Warm Supporter of the Legitimate Drama. The letters informed of the intended opening of a four-anna theatre on May 1, 1840, in a lane in the Bow-Bazar, on the plan and under the same management as the one a few months ago in a godown in Ranny Moody Gully. 

 The imminence of threat is clear in the letters: The Penny theatres in London have had a most demoralising effect on the lower classes, and the same evil must not be allowed to spread here. But who were the actors and the players of the travelling company? 

 Nothing of their history survives, except the tirade of the letter writer who insists that the city newspapers should take an early opportunity of bringing to the Chief Magistrates notice the propriety of prohibiting that which will be a nuisance in the neighbourhood and [whew!] an idle waste of time and money on the part of the foolish young man contemplating the thing. 

 One is only left with the presumption that the players were the unknown real precursors of late 19th Century performers like Baboo Benimadhab Chatterjee the thespian who dreamt of becoming Banglar Garrick in Utpal Duttas play Tiner Talowar (The Tin Sword).

 Monsoon melodies

 Traditionally, Indian classical music was based on folk music, which began as community singing. Originally associated with occupations like farming or fishing, they would welcome seasons like the rains or spring. While dhamar became synonymous with spring, malhar depicted the fury and beauty of the rainy season, mingled with its agony and ecstasy. Such was the impact of the latters tunes and lyrics that eternal melodies in the form of ragas emerged from its earthy mould. Their slow and ponderous movement, as in Megh Malhar or Gaud Malhar, creates an atmosphere of the gathering of storm clouds and impending rain. Tansen created Miyan ki Malhar, while saint poets of the 16th century Surdas, Ramdas and Meerabai were also inspired to improvise and invent Malhars. This evenings concert on Malhars features Samaresh Chowdhury (vocal) with Samar Saha (tabla) and Rajendra Prasad Banerjee (harmonium); and Kushal Das (sitar) with Anindo Chatterjee (tabla).

 Event: Classical music concert on Malhars When: Today at 6 pm Where: Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Vivekananda Hall, Gol Park

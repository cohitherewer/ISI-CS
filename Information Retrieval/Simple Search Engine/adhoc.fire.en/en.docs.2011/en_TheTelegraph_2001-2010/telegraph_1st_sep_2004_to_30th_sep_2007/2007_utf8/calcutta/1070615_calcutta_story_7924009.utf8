The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bank manager whisked away by ex-employee

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The strong-arm tactics employed by private banks to extract their dues boomeranged on a bank manager on Thursday afternoon.

 When Samrat Mitra, regional manager of a private bank, stepped out of his Jhowtolla Road office to meet a former employee, he stepped straight into a trap.

 He was bundled into a waiting car by Mohammad Yakub recently struck off the rolls and four of his accomplices.

 With Mitra not returning for a meeting, his colleagues at the bank sounded the alarm. Policemen from Karaya thana kicked off a high-tech probe by tracking Mitras mobile phone.

 While one team fanned out with details of Mitras description, another kept track of him, from cellphone tower to tower. Mitra, in his mid-30s, was rescued within an hour.

 We were alerted that his mobile was showing a stationary location, at the intersection of Balu Hakkak Lane and Karaya Road. We rushed to the spot and caught sight of him in a Toyota Qualis, said an officer involved in the chase. Yakub and four others in the car were arrested.

 Yakub had been desperately seeking an appointment with Mitra to press for his dues or his re-appointment.

 The last of his frequent calls on Mitras mobile call came around 12.10pm, when the regional manager was in a meeting.

 Deciding to sort out the matter, Mitra took leave of his colleagues for a chat with Yakub outside office.

 As soon as Mitra stepped out, Yakub walked up to him with four others. The five dragged him into a Qualis and drove away.

 Yakub later told the police that he had merely staged an abduction drama to scare Mitra into paying him his dues or withdrawing his termination letter.

 This is the tactic I would use, while in the service of the bank, to force defaulters to clear their dues, Yakub told the cops.

 A resident of Lower Range, in the Karaya area, Yakub was hired by the bank as the leader of a direct sales team. That is normally an euphemism for a team empowered to take direct action against defaulters with terror being their trump-card.

 Yakub and one of his team members, Fakiruddin, were sacked by the company last month, police said.

 He alleged that the bank owed him Rs 15,000 and was refusing to pay up despite repeated requests. On Thursday, he decided to settle a score with Mitra, said an officer of Karaya police station.

 This is not the way to claim your dues, said the deputy commissioner of police (south), Ajay Kumar. You can talk, appeal to higher officials or even move court. But you cant drag a man into a car and drive off.

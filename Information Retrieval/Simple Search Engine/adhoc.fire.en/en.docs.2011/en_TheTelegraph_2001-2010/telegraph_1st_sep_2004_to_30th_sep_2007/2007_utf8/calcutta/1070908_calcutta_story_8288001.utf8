 Reviving a musical heritage

 The growth, evolution and popularity of theatre in Bengal is closely linked with its music. Lyrical melodies rendered by actors and singers bound the diverse elements of a performance into a harmonious whole, bringing a new dimension to the concept of theatre as a form of public entertainment. Mancha-Gaaney Manabi Katha portrays the trend of manchagaan (theatre-songs) of the 19th and 20th centuries through the depiction of womanhood in recurring motifs and images in its songs. Besides, it documents many songs sung by women singers, who remain obscure and unapplauded to this day. Participants: Riddhi Bandyopadhyay (songs) and Soumitra Chattopadhyay (narration). Script and direction: Devajit Bandyopadhyay.

 Event: Theatre songs of Bengal by women singers of the 19th and 20th centuries When: Tomorrow at 7 pm Where: Star Theatre

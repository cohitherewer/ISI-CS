 SMS girl in bail rerun

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A day after Mehak Ahuja was denied bail and remanded in judicial custody till March 26, her family moved a bail plea on Thursday. 

 Mohinder Ahuja, Mehaks father, filed the bail application with the Barrackpore District Additional and Sessions Court, said the lawyer representing the 25-year-old MBA student. 

 She was arrested on the night of March 11 on charges of endangering co-passengers and the flight. On hearing some youths talk about doing something on the plane, she had sent a panic SMS to her father and the flight was recalled. 

 The case will come up for hearing on Saturday.

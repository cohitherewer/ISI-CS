 Freedom show

 eyewitness

Independence Day has become synonymous with August 15, and since we Indians love to celebrate such occasions unquestioningly, this day is used as an excuse to hold shows and sales of every variety. Aakriti Art Gallery presents Freedom: What it means to me, and although many of the works not just paintings are relevant to the theme, one cannot say the same about all the exhibits. There are some thrown in at random. This is, however, not a comment on the quality of works for most bear the stamp of competence. 

 One must also hasten to add that it goes to the gallerys credit that it has taken the risk to exhibit Somas Vandemataram, a 52 x 40 x 6 soft-medium work in deep red with suggestions of the forms of, in all probability, freedom fighters.

 Although there were far too many works by different artists for a viewer to take in at one go, some could be recalled more easily. Some had made an impression for their size Atin Basaks 60 x 26 etching and Rajesh Debs 74 x 62 woodcut on the making of the Ganga which combined mythical and nationalist icons. These two will be remembered as instances of technical bravura.

 Aditya Basaks Journey was an arresting and haunting image of an anatomical drawing of an eye that had sprouted fins swimming through the void like a fish (picture above).

 Wordplay was the crux of Debraj Goswamis painting of a firing squad taking aim at its own image reflected in a cheval glass. Clever like many of this young artists images but somewhat shallow.

 Rima Kundus image of a little girls dress hanging in the sky, picked out with some legends of yardsticks of feminine beauty immediately caught ones attention without making a strident feminist statement. It is a simple image but effective nonetheless, like many simple things.

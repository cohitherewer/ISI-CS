 On gadget guard

 Businessman Mitesh Rupanis mother is 65. He used to be uneasy about leaving her alone at home when the rest of the family went out. But not any more. I have taught her to use the electronic security system we installed in our flat two months back. She can now check who is outside before opening the door, says Mitesh.

 He is not alone. A rising crime graph and dominance of nuclear families where kids and the elderly are often left alone at home for long hours are making Calcuttans seek negligence-proof security. And companies like Zicom, Eureka Forbes and Group 4 have stepped in with an array of gadgets to fill the gap.

 The companies say that the demand for electronic surveillance has gone up recently. The number of customers has increased by about 25 per cent in the past two years, says Partha Sarathi Saha, territory in-charge (projects) of the security system wing of Eureka Forbes in the city. The company has been manufacturing the systems for a decade and has provided security solutions for the Delhi Metro. Zicom puts the growth last year at 40 per cent.

 That the demand has picked up can be gauged from the fact that Group 4, known for providing guards, has started an electronic security systems wing. With multi-storeyed buildings and sprawling malls, the space to be protected has increased. A combination of watchmen and security gadgets is the safest, says Dipak Mukherjee, assistant sales manager, Group 4.

 The security systems in vogue include the fire detection and alarm, gas leak detection and alarm, video door phone, closed-circuit cameras and intrusion alert systems. When the sensors detect an irregularity they set off an alarm and send an alert which is forwarded to the customers and the authorities, explains Shantanu Choudhury, CEO (consumer service group), Zicom.

 Prateek Raja has installed a nine-camera system in his boutique Kanishka, in Gariahat. Often, there are several customers in the boutique. It is not possible to be on watch all the time. Hence, the cameras, he says. The boutique also has an intrusion alert, which is activated at night.

 Raja doesnt believe that people are suffering from insecurity, but there are so many strangers, from sales people to technicians, knocking on the door these days. According to him, nuclear families have made electronic security a must in homes.

 But electronic security systems are not replacing the watchman, yet. I dont think it will happen in the near future. In India, the watchman serves many roles, says Choudhury.

 The cost of electronic surveillance depends on the area covered. Burglar alarms and video door phones cost upwards of Rs 8,000. Fire detection systems cost about Rs 15,000.

 The gadgets come with a warranty and being battery-operated, continue to guard during power cuts.

 It is cost effective to have fewer security men and install a closed-circuit camera in a housing estate. The flat-owners too want that, says Pradip Chopra, director, PS Group, a property development chain.

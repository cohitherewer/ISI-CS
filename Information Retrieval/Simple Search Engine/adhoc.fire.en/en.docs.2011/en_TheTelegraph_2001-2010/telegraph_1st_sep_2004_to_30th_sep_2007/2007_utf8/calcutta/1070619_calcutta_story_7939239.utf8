 Art for environmental awareness

 The result of a prolonged interest and involvement in the area of environmental crisis, The Missing Link, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by Rajiba Lochan Pani, features conceptual landscapes in a state of disease, decay and destruction. The works on show denote the discord, contradiction and conflict between man and nature as a consequence of the formers excessive and indiscriminate interference and exploitation over the latter. A sense of isolation, insulation and detachment pervades the paintings, that no longer operate on a purely visual level. Envisaged as a combination of signs articulating multi-layered meaning, they comment on subjects such as global warming, deforestation, bio-diversity losses, ozone and freshwater depletion, to name a few. Most importantly, the paintings succeed in generating fundamental awareness on environmental crisis as an integral part of human existence on this planet and the need to protect and save it at all costs.

 lEvent: An exhibition of paintings by Rajiba Lochan Pani lWhen: Till June 19; 2 pm - 7.30 pm lWhere: Gallery Kolkata, 2nd floor, 41 Shakespeare Sarani

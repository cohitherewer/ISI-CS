 - EX-state player officiates game

 SUBHAJOY ROY 

 Abhishek Mukherjee at Wimbledon

 Tennis is his passion since childhood. He started playing the game in his teens and went on to represent the state before realising that his forte is umpiring. Ever since, his dream was to officiate on the hallowed All England Tennis Club lawns.

 Abhishek Mukherjees dream came true last month, when he officiated in the Wimbledon main draw the first person from eastern India to do so. The 29-year-old also stood as a line umpire for the qualifying matches of the tournament.

 On the second day of the qualifying games, the chief referee called me. I was a bit tense and was wondering if I had made a mistake. He told me that I would get the chance to officiate in the Wimbledon main draw, recounts Mukherjee.

 He did not have to look back. I officiated in the matches of Marat Safin, Marion Bartoli and Mike and Bob Bryan in the Wimbledon this year. I also got the chance to stand as an umpire in the mens doubles semi-finals. 

 The man from Bhadrakali, in Uttarpara, was no stranger to the grass courts of Wimbledon, though. In 2005 and 2006, he had been a line umpire in qualifying matches. This time, he made it to the main draw, said Hironmoy Chatterjee, the secretary of Bengal Tennis Association. Nitin Kanamwar from Maharashtra was the only other Indian umpire who officiated in the Wimbledon main draw this year.

 Mukherjee, once ranked fifth in the state as a player, discovered his umpiring talent almost by accident. The national championship was being held in Calcutta. Many of the umpires on the panel could not turn up, so I had to do their job, says Mukherjee. He earned the right to officiate in international games after clearing the ITF Level 2 exam in October 1999.

 Mukherjee is now a white badge International Tennis Federation (ITF) official. My aim is to clear the bronze badge test conducted by the ITF. After that, I will become a silver badge and gold badge official, depending on my performance, he said.

 When not busy umpiring, Mukherjee imparts tennis lessons to students of Pailan World School. He is also the technical development officer of Bengal Tennis Association. But his fantasy is to officiate a Wimbledon final on Centre Court.

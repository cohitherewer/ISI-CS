 Motorcycle mishaps claimed two youths and seriously injured three on Sunday morning. Neither of the youths was wearing helmets.

 In the first accident, four young men had piled on to one two-wheeler. Police suspect they were drunk.

 In the other mishap, the motorcycle had not been maintained properly and its brakes were not working.

 The motorcycle on which the four were riding was hit by a truck near Police Training School, on AJC Bose Road, around 4.30 am. The youths were flung on the road and sustained injuries on the head.

 All of them were bleeding profusely when they were shifted to SSKM Hospital. One of them, identified as Rajiv Adhikary, 22, died, said deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim.

 According to a police officer, the youths were returning from a marriage and may have consumed alcohol.

 It appears that the motorcyclist reacted late. The truck was travelling fast and the driver could not apply the brakes on time, he stated. 

 In the other mishap, 17-year-old Uddhav Poddar was killed after being run over by an unidentified vehicle at the intersection of Syed Amir Ali Avenue and Gurusaday Road, near CC amp;FC, around 6.45 am. 

 The motorcycle was probably hit by a heavy vehicle like a truck or a trailer. The teenager appears to have been killed more out of shock than due to the collision. The injuries he sustained were not fatal, said a traffic police officer.

 We found that the motorcycles brakes were not functioning well. This is indicative of a trend. Many youngsters do not maintain their two-wheelers, often leading to fatal accidents, added the officer.

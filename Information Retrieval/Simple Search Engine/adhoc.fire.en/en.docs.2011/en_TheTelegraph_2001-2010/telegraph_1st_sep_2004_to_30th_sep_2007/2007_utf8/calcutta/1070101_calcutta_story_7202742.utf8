 Independent strokes

 The perfect example of a rebel artist, Bibekananda Santra comes across as a painter who consciously steers clear of traditional themes, styles and techniques to explore a creative realm that is distinctively his own. Black and Beyond Space, the ongoing exhibition of his recent works, reveals a fiercely independent spirit, that only allows him to articulate his own feelings through his art. The paintings, most of which were created during the years he spent in Pondicherry, offer fresh perspectives on aspects of life that are apparently familiar. His style of presentation, however, convinces us that his paintings are more ideal, imaginary and illusory than they seem to be. A non-conformist to the core, his works clearly express his indifference to contemporary life and society. Yet, an element of hope pervades his most intimate and intense artistic compositions.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Bibekananda Santra 

When: Till December 7, 3 pm - 7 pm 

Where: Galerie 88, 28B Shakespeare Sarani

 Protest on Howrah tracks 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 About 200 workers of the permanent way inspector department of the Eastern Railway agitated on the railway tracks near platform 15 of Howrah station for around 90 minutes on Tuesday to protest the alleged assault of a supervisor by an RPF constable.

 Several trains were delayed, forcing passengers to get off and walk to the station.

 The workers claimed that the supervisor has been admitted to Howrah Orthopaedic Hospital with several injuries. 

 An RPF spokesperson, however, said the incident had been blown out of proportion and that no one was admitted to hospital.

 The railway authorities have started a probe into the incident, which took place around 10.30am. The supervisor, Swarup Sinha, was inspecting the tracks when P. Ghosh, the constable, demanded to see his identity card. After an altercation, Ghosh allegedly beat up Swarup.

 Officials had to persuade the agitating employees to lift the blockade.

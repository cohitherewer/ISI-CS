 Tollywood heaved a sigh of relief after a daylong strike on Monday, but its troubles are not over yet.

 Partha Kar, secretary, Federation of Cine Technicians and Workers of Eastern India, declared on the NT1 premises that it was calling off the strike but for feature films only.

 Information and culture secretary Dilip Chakraborty, meanwhile, said the strike was not justified as the government had met the federations demand and arrested the assailants.

 Mondays strike was the fallout of a dispute over work distribution between the Federation and Broadcast Quality Video Technicians and Workers Association of West Bengal (Brota).

 Trouble began on May 7, when three Brota technicians were denied work in a feature film, Shedin Dujone, being shot at NT1 studios. About 50 Brota members protested on the NT1 premises bringing work to a halt. They camped there till May 12. Brota is an illegal organisation and its members have no right to work in films, alleged Kar.

 Before withdrawing the strike, Kar laid down a few conditions before Eastern India Motion Pictures Association (EIMPA), which gave the federation a verbal assurance. Based on that, work on feature films was asked to resume. But serials will not be spared till a written assurance is received from EIMPA, Kar added.

 The conditions the federation has laid down before EIMPA for the strike against serials to be lifted are a written assurance stating that Brota has no agreement with EIMPA and that it is operating illegally. Brota exists at the federations mercy. Brota doesnt have the right to work in the industry. Whatever Brota did on May 7 was illegal. EIMPA will go in for a fresh agreement regarding wage hike and code of conduct with the federation. EIMPA will have to hold a meeting with the federation and not with Brota, stressed Kar, adding that the federation is a 47-year-old body affiliated to the All India Confederation. So when we called the strike there was a complete shutdown in Tollywood. 

 Producers are caught in the crossfire. We suffered a loss of over Rs 2 lakh on Monday, said Arindam Sil, executive producer, Moxie Entertainment.

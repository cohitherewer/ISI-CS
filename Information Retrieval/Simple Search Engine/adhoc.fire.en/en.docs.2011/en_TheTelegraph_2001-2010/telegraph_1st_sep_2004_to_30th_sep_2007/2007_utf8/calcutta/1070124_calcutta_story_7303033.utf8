House arrest about to end

Screen On amp; Off

 Its UK version may be facing a forced ending but the first season of Big Brother in India, Bigg Boss, is headed for a natural denouement. There are just four inmates left in the house Ravi Kishen, Rakhi Sawant, Rahul Roy and Carol Gracias of whom one will be evicted on Wednesday leaving three finalists.

 Bigg Boss has already ordered all the inmates to pack their bags and everybody in the house is very excited. Carol expects the game to get tougher and loves the brain behind drain, while Ravi and Rahul are waiting for one more surprise after the re-entries of Rakhi and Kashmira Shah.

 Everybody is happy at the thought of getting out of the house, at last. Carol described it as the first stage of freedom.

 The Wednesday eviction drive will be a surprise one. Earlier in the week, when Bigg Boss asked everybody to sit in the living room, they were really nervous to nominate each other. But Bigg Boss spelt it out that there will be no nominations this week, and everybody jumped out of their seats in joy.

 The eviction on Wednesday will be solely on the basis of audience votes and the same procedure will apply when a winner will be picked from the three finalists.

 D-Day is Saturday night when Bigg Boss will be beamed live on Sony and host Arshad Warsi will announce the winner of the first season.

 In hindsight, the highlights of Bigg Boss have definitely been Rakhi Sawant and Kashmira Shahs hushed conspiracy, Aryan Vaid and Anupama Vermas platonic love story and Roopali Gangulys breaking down and shedding copious tears at the drop of a hat.

 Whether the show will be able to turn the fortunes of a forgotten actor like Rahul Roy or a struggling actor like Amit Sadh, we have to wait and watch. But unlike Shilpa Shetty, who is reportedly already getting offers for international movies inside the Celebrity Big Brother house, Bigg Boss inmates can at most look forward to a resurgent career on TV.

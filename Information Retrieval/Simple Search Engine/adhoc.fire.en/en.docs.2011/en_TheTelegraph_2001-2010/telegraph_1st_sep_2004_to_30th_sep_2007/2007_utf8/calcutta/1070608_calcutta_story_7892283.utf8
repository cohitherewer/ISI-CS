The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Held for con job attempt

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A woman in her late-20s, posing as a sales executive, has been arrested for trying to dupe a woman.

 Police suspect Manasi Ghatak, an Entally resident, had duped several people in the past. Her luck ran out on Wednesday evening, when she walked into the second-floor flat of the Khandelwals on Mahatma Gandhi Road.

 As Poonam Khandelwal stepped out, Manasi introduced herself as an executive from Royal Marketing Agency and even flashed an identity card. Manasi told Poonam that she had won a gift coupon worth Rs 10,000, with which she could buy home appliances.

 There was a catch, though. Manasi said that to get the coupon, Poonam needed to pay her Rs 2,000 and later buy from her detergent powder worth Rs 3,000. An elated Poonam rushed to her neighbour, who smelt a rat and informed police, said Buddhadeb Mukhopadhayay, of Jorasanko thana. Cops rushed to the flat and rounded up Manasi.

 She told the police that the company she claimed to represent did not exist. I needed money because my mother is ailing and I cannot afford her treatment, said Manasi, whose husband runs a catering business.

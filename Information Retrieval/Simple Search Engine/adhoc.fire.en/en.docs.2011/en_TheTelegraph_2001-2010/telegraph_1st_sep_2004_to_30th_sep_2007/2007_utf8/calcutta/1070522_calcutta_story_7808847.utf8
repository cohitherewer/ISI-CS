 The giant chessboard of Harry Potters adventure in The Chamber of Secrets is coming to life at Science City, on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.

 The institute is introducing three mind games to develop the logical prowess of students and research scholars, as part of its 10th anniversary celebrations.

 The games Pressure Matrix, Powers of 10 and Optical Illusions are being developed by the Central Research and Training Laboratory, a unit of the National Council of Science Museums.

 In Pressure Matrix, a player has to find a hidden treasure hoard by standing on a giant chequered board, similar to the chessboard in the Harry Potter story. A computer will monitor the moves (jumps) made by the player who has to proceed from one square to another till he reaches the treasure.

 In Powers of 10, the player gets a chance to understand the dimensions of the universe, from the smallest microcosm to the enormous galactic systems. The game is played through a system of scales.

 Optical Illusions will try to confuse the player by using the limitation of the human eye in seeing and receiving images. The game will try to build an awareness of common optical phenomena in the player.

 Science City will complete the 10th year of its existence on July 1 and the new games will be part of the celebrations, said G.S. Rautela, director of Science City. 

 We want to draw a larger number of new-generation visitors. There are a number parks in and around the city which offer items only for amusement. Ours is different from those. We always want to maintain the feel of pleasure associated with learning through a game, said Rautela.

 Every year, more than 1.3 million visitors come to Science City from different parts of the country and also from abroad.

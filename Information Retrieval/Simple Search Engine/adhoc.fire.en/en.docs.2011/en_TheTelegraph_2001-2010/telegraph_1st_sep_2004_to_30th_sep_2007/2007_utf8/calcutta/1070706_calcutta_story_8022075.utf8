 A 25-ft stretch of VIP Road caved in on Thursday morning, sparking fears of further deluge-driven damage to the key connector between the airport and the city. 

 Spotting a stretch of the road near the Kestopur bus stop, on the airport-to-Ultadanga flank missing, some local residents raised an alarm and officials from the irrigation and public works departments rushed to the spot to assess the damage. 

 A portion of VIP Road has caved in near the culvert on Bagjola canal. It seems that soil erosion due to overflowing water through the canal is the reason behind the sudden cave-in, said a senior irrigation department official after visiting the spot. 

 The guard wall along the culvert on the canal maintained by the irrigation department has also fallen off. 

 According to a PWD official, the cave-in has exposed the soil under the road to further erosion and a serious assessment of the roads foundation is a must, given the volume of traffic on VIP Road. 

 We are not quite sure about the condition of the foundation of the road on that stretch. The nature of the damage is, indeed, cause for concern, he added. 

 Water from Baranagar, Dum Dum, Sinthee and Jawpur are flushed out to Bidyadhari river through Bagjola canal. 

 A major desilting operation was carried out along the stretch recently. But it seems the force of drained-out water from these areas is causing havoc on the foundation, explained an official. 

 Lack of maintenance of the culvert and the sudden rise in the volume of water through the canal due to the rain have been cited as the other reasons behind the cave-in. 

 The PWD has taken some temporary safety measures. We have created a fence around the stretch. Soon, we will start repair work, said a PWD official.

 Realty boom draws blood, employee shot dead

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The mid-segment realty boom in the Lake Town area drew blood on Monday afternoon, with an employee of a construction firm being shot dead from point-blank range.

 Biju Roy, 25, an employee of Somani Realtor in charge of booking apartments, was in office near a building under construction at Dakshindari when two youths arrived in a taxi around 3.20 pm. The duo enquired about Biju and then entered the office. They asked Biju to step outside.

 The three spoke for around five minutes, after which one of the youths started shouting at Biju. He then whipped out a revolver and fired thrice, shooting Biju in the head and chest, said a witness.

 As Biju fell to the ground, bleeding, his assailants got into the waiting taxi and fled.

 Labourers working at the construction site rushed to the spot and called up the owner of Somani Realtor. Biju was rushed to a nearby nursing home, where he was pronounced brought dead.

 He was shot dead from point-blank range. The duo apparently wanted to settle a personal score, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 This has turned the spotlight on the shady construction boom in this congested part of Calcutta. Dubious deals are struck here every day as the construction business is controlled by local criminals, while police turn a blind eye, alleged a resident of Dakshindari.

 Witnesses told police there were two other youths on a motorcycle waiting 20 metres from the site of the murder. They must have been part of the gang. They were keeping a watch, from a distance. After the attack, they sped away behind the taxi, said an an officer of Lake Town police station.

 Preliminary investigation revealed that Biju had been working with the construction company for the past one-and-a-half years. The firm is engaged in the construction of a four-storeyed housing estate, Haridham Apartment.

 Booking of flats started about three months ago and Biju was in charge of that. Most of the flats have been booked, said the officer.

 A resident of Champahati, in South 24-Parganas district, Biju was a bachelor. A team has gone to Champahati to probe his antecedents and ascertain whether he had made enemies in his line of work, police said.

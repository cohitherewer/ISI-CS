 Rehana Sultana had a dream. She wanted to be a school teacher. On Friday morning, the 12-year-olds dream lay crushed under the wheels of a private bus on VIP Road.

 Rehana was being taken to hospital for some medical tests by her father on his motorcycle. She was not wearing a helmet.

 Abdul Khalek, 42, was taking his daughter Rehana to a municipal hospital in Dum Dum when a bus on route 79D nudged the motorcycle in Kaikhali. The impact was enough to hurl the girl off the motorcycle and under the buss rear wheels. Khalek escaped with minor shoulder injuries, said the superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas), Praveen Kumar.

 The Khaleks are residents of Bhojerhat, in South 24-Parganas. Rehana was a meritorious student of Class VI, of Bhagwanpur High School, Bhojerhat, and her father teaches in a local government primary school. They were on their way to a Dum Dum hospital as the doctor treating her was from Rajarhat.

 According to witnesses, the accident took place around 9am when the motorcycle tried to overtake the bus .The toolbox of the motorcycle hit the bumper of the bus, toppling the two-wheeler. The girl could not keep her balance and fell to her left, between the front and rear wheels of the bus, said Bhabesh Dutta, a taxi driver.

 Rehanas father fell to his right, slamming into the iron railing of the road divider and escaping with shoulder injuries.

 What can I say? I have lost everything, Abdul Khalek mumbled to Metro, before going silent.

 The accident took place minutes before chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees convoy passed by. So, officers of Baguiati traffic outpost and Rajarhat police station got into the act to clear the accident site in a hurry and prevent any untoward incident when the cavalcade passed by.

 As news reached Bhojerhat, people of the entire locality gathered at Rehanas house. She was a bright student who usually stood first in class. She was good in cultural activities and was always in the forefront. And whenever she was asked what she wanted to be, Rehana said she wanted to be a teacher, said her tutor Feroz Ahmed.

 Following the tragedy on Friday, the death count on VIP Road this year rose to four.

 Residents of the Kaikhali area alleged that illegal encroachment along VIP Road was causing congestion and leading to accidents.

 There is a Citu-affiliated taxi stand and several shops along VIP Road. These are all illegal and they add to the bottleneck at the crossroads, said a resident. Police spring into action only when there is some VIP expected to pass.

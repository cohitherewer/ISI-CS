 The City Diary

 Two men committed suicide in the city on Monday, driven to despair by poverty. Gopal Das, 48, an employee of Calcutta Telephones, hanged himself from the bedroom ceiling of his Mominpur home. According to police, Das was suffering from depression for failing to make ends meet. In the other incident, Pralay Saha, 38, was found hanging at his DL Khan Road residence. The police said Saha was unemployed and is survived by his wife and son.

 Mithu Sikdar, 29, was found hanging in her bedroom at Jairampur, in Behala, on Monday. A case was started after Mithus family members alleged that her in-laws would regularly torture her for dowry. Her husband and father-in-law have been arrested.

 Four persons were arrested on Monday from Kaikhali, in Baguiati, following an altercation with the security guard of an ATM counter of a private bank. Police said trouble broke out after the four entered the counter together and the guard asked two of them not to use their cellphones inside.

 A roadblock by residents of Mahestala on Monday morning threw traffic on Budge Budge Trunk Road out of gear for nearly four hours. Police said the residents were demonstrating against the poor condition of roads and waterlogging problems. The blockade was lifted after the local municipal authorities assured them of action.

 Three persons were arrested on Monday from Dakshindari, in the Lake Town area, after more than five kg of ganja was found on them. Police said the trio had been involved in drug trafficking for a long time.

 Unrest is brewing at Jorasanko Thakurbari, with students and teachers of Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) planning to oppose the authorities decision to shift the fine arts and performing arts departments to the BT Road campus.

 After rounds of meetings, the students and teachers have decided to take up the matter with the state government if the university top brass ignores their plea.

 As a first step, the RBU administrators have planned to move the Rabindrasangeet department to a new five-storeyed building on the BT Road campus this month. The campus currently houses the arts departments.

 We have submitted a memorandum to vice-chancellor Bharati Mukherjee, requesting her not to shift the fine arts and performing arts departments to the BT Road campus, which does not have the required infrastructure, claimed Kaustav Chatterjee, secretary of the Calcutta district committee of Students Federation of Indias, which controls RBUs students union.

 Responding to a plan of the state government, RBU has undertaken a programme to preserve Thakurbari as a heritage building. It has set up a five-storeyed building on its BT Road campus for housing the fine arts and performing arts departments. According to students, the Jorasanko campus is more accessible for students coming from the districts, many of whom study in the fine arts and performing arts departments of the university. 

 Being the birthplace of Tagore, Jorasanko offers the right ambience for conducting courses in dance, music and painting, pointed out a teacher.

 The buildings, classrooms, laboratories, stages and even the libraries on the campus are meant for running courses in fine arts and visual arts. The classrooms are different from average classrooms. Renowned artists like Ahindra Choudhury and Uday Shankar had designed the classrooms in 1961, when the university was set up, he added.

 Members of the universitys teachers association met on Monday to discuss these issues. We will have to abide by the authorities decision. We will try and explain our point of view to the administrators before we move to the other campus, said Subir Nandi, a teacher of vocal music and a member of the association. 

 Vice-chancellor Bharati Mukherjee refused to comment on the matter.

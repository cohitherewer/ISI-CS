 New homes for oustees

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 They had to pay a price for progress. Now, the government wants to do its bit for them. 

 To rehabilitate 2,800 families, evicted from their homes to pave way for developmental work, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), in association with Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP), has taken up a low-cost housing project. The estate will come up in Nonadanga, off Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, on a 10-acre CMDA plot. 

 According to estimates, the housing project will require around Rs 45 crore, of which 50 per cent will come from the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission and 30 per cent from either the CMDA or the CEIP. The remaining part of the cost will be borne by the beneficiaries. 

 Our objective is to provide basic housing facilities to the economically-weaker sections of society. Besides sharing the project cost, we are providing the land free, said P.R. Baviskar, chief executive officer, CMDA. 

 For infrastructure facilities like drainage and roads, the central government will bear 50 per cent of the cost, while the CMDA or the CEIP will provide the rest.

 The project will be taken up under the Basic Services for the Urban Poor scheme of the CMDA and the work will start from this month. 

 We expect the project to be completed in one-and-a-half years, added Baviskar. 

 According to a CMDA official, 2,000 families evicted from the Gobindapur railway colony will be first accommodated in the proposed project. The remaining flats will be distributed among people who lost their shelters due to CEIP projects. 

 The beneficiaries will have to pay between Rs 70,000 and Rs 1,00,000 for the flats, said a CMDA official, adding that the estate will have a childrens playground, community hall and a small market.

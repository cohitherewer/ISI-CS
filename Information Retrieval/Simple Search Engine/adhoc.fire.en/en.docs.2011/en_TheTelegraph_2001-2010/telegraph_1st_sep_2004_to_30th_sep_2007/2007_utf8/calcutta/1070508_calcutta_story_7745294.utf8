 Memories relived

Young and old students of Shri Shikshayatan College recently came together at the fifth annual alumni meet, where senior students of the association outclassed fresh pass-outs on the enthusiasm quotient and energy levels. 

 More than 250 ex-students, including president of the association, theatre personnel Usha Ganguli, and playback singer Ritika Sahni (picture by Pabitra Das), turned up for the get-together on April 26 on the college premises. Among those present were two students from the first batch of the college, Renu Himatsingka and Meera Jain, who passed out in 1958. The alumni has 1,800 members.

 The first annual alumni meet of the college dates back to the early 60s. The meet continued uninterrupted till the late 80s. Then it was discontinued. The alumni and the annual meet was revived in 2003, said Debjani Nag, an ex-student and the current head of the department of the English Department.

 Popular numbers by Ritika Sahni, who has lent her voice to tracks in Bollywood movies like Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon and Shyam Benegals Hari Bhari, stole the show. Students young and old shook a leg on the dance floor as the generation gap was comfortably bridged.

General secretary of the alumni association, Sunita Kapoor, informed that the organisation attempts to make a difference through social work. The old students regularly visit Nirmala Shishu Bhawan where they interact with children and make contributions towards their welfare. Scholarships for free study in Shri Shikshayatan College are awarded to needy students. 

 Sushmita Gupta, an ex-student of this college, has started a school for underprivileged children at Lake Gardens, where members of our alumni teach for free, informed Kapoor.

 Ganguli, who became president of the alumni in 2006, told Metro that they were making an effort to organise more social activities. With time, students have become career-oriented and want early financial independence. This often forces them away from social and cultural activities, said the 1964 pass-out.

 Make IT focused

 With the proliferation of the IT sector, there is an urgent need to bridge the gap between industry and institutions training students in information technology. With this in mind, Nexgen Institute of Business and Technology (NIBT) organised a seminar on April 21 on Information Technology Management. Inaugurated by state civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee, it had sessions on IT scope management, infrastructure, vendor and risk management. 

 In the scope management section, speakers felt that projects often failed because of poor scope definition the expectations of clients not being understood by the team handling the project. 

 The session on vendor management began with discussion on the importance of including an exit clause in the vendor agreement contract when recruiting overseas resources. Surya Sarathi Barat, director, PDSIT, Bengal Engineering and Science University, spoke about the distinct needs of each client that require joint application development sessions for producing software customised for the needs of the client. Professor Sanjiv D. Vaidya of Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, explained the purpose of outsourcing as the better management of IT resources. He admitted: IT hasnt been delivering benefits anywhere near the investments made in it. As solution, he suggested increasing awareness of the senior management of the company about the IT opportunities available to them and to make information available by marketing new services. 

 The final session on risk management was conducted by the Computer Society of India. We are trying to equip students to deal with industry demands. The seminar focuses on the issues they have to deal with when they enter the market, said Lalit Mohan Tyagi, president of NIBT.

 THE DIARY 

 Female Fiasco 

 Is it a boy or a girl? rdquo; the father inquired 

 ldquo; A baby girl quot; , the guileless nurse fired 

 ldquo;Oh , another burden, said the father, tired. 

As the in- laws sat in the hospital, 

Against the mother they conspired. 

Everyone rsquo;s whims and fancies were 

To foresee the baby rsquo;s life: 

 She would grow up illiterate, to mother a dozen, 

 After she became a wife. 

 So, secure her rights to effacious education, 

 Abolish injustice 

 And foster progress for the nation. 

 We foist slogans like ,'liberty, equality,fraternity' 

 Which does not adapt 

 To female posterity. 

 Every female has the right 

 To instruction, emancipation and learning, 

 So educate females 

 And extinguish the conflagration 

 In which they have been burning.

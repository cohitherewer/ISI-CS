 Blinding bling for brides

 The style story on Day One of Bridal Asia 2007 was taken forward by fashion biggies Malini Ramani and Rina Dhaka after Surily Goel and Pakistani label Karma showcased two lines each on the makeshift ramp at The Grand. 

 While lots of pink, bling and contemporary cuts dominated the Surily Goel show, Karma Wedding represented by designers Maheen and Kamee boasted of old-world aura and traditional Pakistani silhouettes. 

 Up next, were Malini and Rina... 

 Global garb

 For once, Malini Ramanis collection had more variety than just breezy resort wear. My collection is for the bride who travels all over the world, said the designer with a passion for tropical islands.

 Aptly titled Jet-Set Bride, the four-part collection started with The Bombay Bride, moving on to the designers favourite The Tropical Bride, then to Rajasthani Princess and finally to The Roman Wedding.

 ing was the common thread running through all four lines that covered all kinds of looks sought by todays bride.

 Lots of lehngas in a riot of colours formed the first collection for the sexy Bollywood style diva. Lighter saris, lehngas and salwar kameezes in toned-down pinks and blues formed the range for the boho-island goddess. Bold Rajasthani colours and traditionally embroidered lehngas came next. And finally, the Roman look was a stark contrast in nudes and creams with metallic shimmer. 

 Short dresses and cocktail lehngas and saris made up the line.

 For bridals, anything goes in ornamentation, the more the better. Hence, we have used all kinds of embroidery and techniques that we know of. From threadwork to mirrorwork, Swarovski, kundan and appliques, the collection has everything, explained Malini.

 Final flourish

 The first evening drew to a close with Rina Dhakas highly stylised trousseau line. Kameez with churidar (often calf-length), short dresses, leggings, as well as saris and lehngas made up the collection. The sexy silhouettes were fitted at the body with flouncing hemlines.

 The colours were a mix of neutrals, whites, pastels and bright hues pinks, blues, lime greens, reds and more. Indian threadwork, mirrorwork, abstract prints, a hint of crochet and applique, along with a liberal dash of gold decorated the pieces. Fur wraps and trimmings added the winter touch.

 My collection is for the stylish modern bride who demands much more than just saris for her trousseau, said Rina.

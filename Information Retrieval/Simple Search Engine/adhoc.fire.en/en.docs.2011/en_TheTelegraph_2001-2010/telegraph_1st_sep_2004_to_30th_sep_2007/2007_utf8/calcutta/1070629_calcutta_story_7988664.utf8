 Quotations sought for LPG kits

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The process of getting the citys autorickshaws to shift to the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) mode started on Thursday, with transport department officials meeting makers and distributors of green fuel kits from across the country.

 We have invited quotations from certified LPG kit manufacturers. The last date for submitting the applications is July 10, said Sumantra Chowdhury, principal secretary in the department.

 The government will initially focus on getting autos manufactured before January 2000 the count is more than 40,000 to switch to LPG.

 It will be mandatory for the 60,000-odd autos plying in the city to switch to LPG. Each owner will get a subsidy of Rs 4,000, said public vehicles department director Mohammad Kamran.

 The total conversion cost will be around Rs 16,000, said an industry insider.

 The transport department will invite a third party to keep a check on the quality of the LPG kits. We will approach Jadavpur University and other certified bodies to carry out checks, said Chowdhury.

 Abduct cry in missing girl case

 A STAFF REPORTER

Dhara Soni, 15, a resident of Howrah town, has been missing since the morning of February 21. Father Mukesh, a trader and human rights activist, has lodged a police complaint, accusing a Shibpur youth of abducting the girl.

 The youth, Rizwan Khan, has been missing, too. One of his friends, Afroz, has been arrested, but he could not provide any information about Rizwan or Dhara. 

 We have got Rizwans cellphone number from Afroz, but that has not been of any help, said an officer probing Dharas disappearance.

 A case of kidnapping has been registered. We are investigating the matter from all angles, said Milan Das, additional superintendent of police (town).

 Her parents last saw Dhara when she left their GT Road home for school around 6.30 am on February 21. Since then, we havent heard anything from her, said Mukesh, member of the Howrah-based Asia Front of Human Rights.

 The family launched a hunt for the girl when she failed to return in the afternoon. We looked for her at all possible places, including the houses of friends and relatives and hospitals. After all our searches drew a blank, we lodged a missing diary on the night of February 21, said Mukesh.

 Later, some of Dharas schoolmates informed Mukesh that they saw Rizwan talking to her near the school on February 21. An abduction case was then lodged by the family.

 An officer said Rizwan has been staying in PM Bustee for the past few years, ever since he was driven out of home by father Amir Khan.

 I know this girl for long. It is unbelievable she will elope with a goon, said Gayatri Singh, the next-door neighbour of the Sonis.

 Even if my girl is dead, I would like to know that for sure. I have been running from pillar to post in search of her. I cant take it any longer, said Usha, Dharas mother.

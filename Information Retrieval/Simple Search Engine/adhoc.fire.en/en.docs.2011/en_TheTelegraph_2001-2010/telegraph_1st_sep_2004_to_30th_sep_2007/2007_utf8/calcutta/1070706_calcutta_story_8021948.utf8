 Doctors warn of post-rain infection 

 A STAFF REPORTER

Doctors have warned Calcuttans against a host of infections that usually follows a prolonged spell of rain and waterlogging.

 The situation prevailing now is ideal for the spread of a plethora of water-borne diseases. They include typhoid, skin diseases, blood dysentery and diarrhoea. Some of them can be fatal if left untreated, said general physician Sunil Kumar Nag.

 During a downpour, there is a swirl in the water that does not allow the concentration of micro-organisms that cause those diseases to grow. But the problem starts when it stops raining. The concentration of the organisms increases in stagnant water, and with it rises the risk of infection, he explained.

 Apurba Ghosh, the director of Institute of Child Health, warned that children are most vulnerable to infections, as they love wading through waterlogged streets and are usually not aware of hygiene.

 If they have a fever, suffer from diarrhoea or pass blood through stool, consult a doctor immediately, said Ghosh. 

 His advice to parents: Make sure children take off their shoes after returning home, and wash their feet and dry them properly.

 Dermatologist Debabrata Bandyopadhyay has drawn attention to the possibility of fungal infections, especially in the feet, if you wade in water for long.

 A fungal infection between fingers and toes is a common occurrence in this season. So is folliculitis, that causes the skin to itch and form pustules.

 The patient turnout in almost all city hospitals, government and private, has increased manifold following the rain. Whats more alarming is that a significant section of the patients comprises children.

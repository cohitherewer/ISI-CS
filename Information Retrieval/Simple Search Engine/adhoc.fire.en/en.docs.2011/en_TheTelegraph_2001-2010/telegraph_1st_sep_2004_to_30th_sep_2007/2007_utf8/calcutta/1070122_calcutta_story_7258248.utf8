 Medical body rapped for doctor clean chit

 - Lax probe into negligence death accusation

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 The state health department has pulled up the West Bengal Medical Council for giving a clean chit to surgeon S.K. Nawaz, who has been accused of causing the death of a patient in 2002.

 The patients eldest son, Aziz Mubarki, met Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi last year, after which the case was forwarded to chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb.

 The additional chief secretary in the health and family welfare department had written to medical council registrar K.K. Bagchi, stating that the probe against Nawaz suffered from procedural lapses.

 The investigation carried out by the West Bengal Medical Council suffers from procedural lapses. I, therefore, order that the issue of medical negligence, as alleged against S.K. Nawaz, be reinvestigated. The council will take a decision thereafter..., the letter read.

 On December 2002, Ahmed Mubarki, 65, was taken to a doctor with suspected gangrene in one of his big toes. He was admitted to a nursing home and subsequently referred to Nawaz. The surgeon prescribed an injection that does not exist. After 16 days in the clinic, Mubarkis right leg was amputated, but the infection had already spread and he died in a month.

 Nawaz had prescribed an injection, Antigas Gangrene Human Anti Sera, that does not exist. He also advised that administration of insulin be stopped, though he... diagnosed the disease as diabetic gangrene of lower leg, the additional chief secretarys letter added.

 The health departments order to reinvestigate the case has been welcomed by the victims family. We welcome the governments decision. My father died because of the doctors negligence. We want justice, declared Aziz.

 He had launched a campaign for justice, shooting off more than 1,000 letters to various people in authority, including the Prime Minister, President, chief minister, governor, senior police officers and members of the state medical council and the Medical Council of India. Only the governor granted him audience.

 I still remember December 26, 2002... We were running from pillar to post for an ampoule of human anti-sera, but could not find it anywhere, Aziz recalled. 

 Dilip Kumar Ghosh, registrar of the state medical council, said the additional chief secretarys letter was received a couple of days ago. He refused comment how the council gave a clean chit to the doctor.

 Nawaz was unavailable for comment.

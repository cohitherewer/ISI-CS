 Bar raids lead to 29 arrests

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police raided two lodge-cum-bars in the airport area on Monday and arrested 29 people, including 14 women, on Monday.

 The raids were an attempt to check flesh trade and influx of criminals into the bars. Last month, two people were killed in a brawl at a bar in Sankrail, Howrah.

 We received complaints that illegal activities were going on in some lodge-cum-bars in the airport and Dum Dum police station areas. We raided some of these lodges and arrested some men and women, who were found in compromising positions, said North 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar. 

 The first raid was conducted at Raj Guesthouse around 2pm. Three of the rooms were found locked from inside.

 We asked the manager of the lodge to open the rooms. We later broke open the doors and found 10 pairs of youths in compromising positions, said an officer of Dum Dum police station.

 Officers of airport police station then raided Airways Guesthouse and arrested three couples. We also the arrested the managers of the lodge and a pimp who used to run the flesh trade racket there, said a senior officer.

 On Sunday, hotels and lodges with bars in Salt Lake were raided. There was no arrest.

 Kumar said raids would be conducted without warning at more bars in the area to keep the criminals and call girls out. We had asked the bar-owners to monitor customers and if possible, keep a close watch on them. The bar-owners are also to keep a tab on the crooners, added Kumar.

 On May 28, Suren Singh and Prakash Singh were shot dead during a brawl at Sish Mahal bar in Sankrail, Howrah. The incident had prompted a ban on crooners in bars in the district.

 New call centre in Salt Lake

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A new call centre, which has already bagged processes from the US, UK and Australia, was inaugurated at Salt Lake on Sunday by N.K. Mukherjee, project manager, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. 

 The call centre, Prism Infotech, will go live on Tuesday, with a US mortgage process and a UK wireless process. 

 The company will generate 215 jobs, and 38 people have been hired till date. 

 Chairman of the firm Chiranjiv Saha said the screening process of recruitment will be stringent. 

 We have to compete with top companies that are already here and thus, candidates will be required to clear the five or six normal rounds, after which they undergo a 15-day training. They have to clear yet another test before they are hired, he added. 

 Saha, who has been a promoter, said that an initial expenditure of Rs 60 lakhs has been made on Prism Infotech.

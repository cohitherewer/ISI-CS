 When caged women try to sing of the skies

 Namuna Bibi is a rather exceptional woman. She left her husband to continue her singing and today she earns her living. But what makes her really stand out is that she is not afraid to criticise interpretations of Muslim shariyas in her songs. In public. 

 Ami mokka jabo hoj manabo/tosbi libo golate/mokka jabo kon rastate (I will go to Mecca, wearing beads on my neck, please show me the way), she sings, imitating a maulvi who is looking lasciviously at women while mouthing the pious intentions. 

 Namuna Bibi, from Ketugram in Burdwan, is one of the tribe of women from villages in Burdwan, Birbhum, Murshidabad and Bankura, who make a living out of singing such provocative songs. Hawa Bibi of Murshidabad, Bajra Bibi of Birbhum and Sandesh Bibi of Murshidabad have also defied age-old social constraints to sing freely without a care. They are the subject of a documentary film Mon Amar Uronjahaj Re by Utsav Mukherjee. 

 Yet they are part of the community. Muslim women singers are common in these districts. They perform during celebrations an age-old custom. The tradition of singing on an occasion is very old among the rural Muslim community, says Ratna Rashid, who is researching on these singers for more than 25 years. She is also the headmistress of a school in Burdwan.

 The age of these singers varies from seven to 70. About seven singers form a group. During a marriage the singing starts from the day of paka dekha or paan-chini (the day when the marriage is finalised by the elders of the families) and goes on for a month till the bride leaves for the in-laws. 

 The singers write the lyrics themselves. Many a time the lyrics have gaalis (abuse), says Ratna. The subject is varied: From social to political and religious issues, nothing goes missing.

 And men are not allowed at such a majlish. In the film, the women not only address religious hypocrisy: They charge teeth-and-claws at excesses of the patriarchal society. A woman sang while criticising a maulavi: Shukur alaham dolilla/yarappana/tomar shayar bhitor dhuke jabo ar berobo na (An Arabic chant is followed by the statement from a hypocritical maulvi who tells a woman that he will dive under her petticoat). 

 Often the women sing songs that are almost forgotten. Rare unrecorded songs of Abdul Alim, a folk singer born in Talibpur, Murshidabad, are sung by these women. Alim was a contemporary of Kazi Nazrul Islam and Abbasuddin Ahmed, who became a radio artist in Dhaka after the Partition and one of the pioneers of the revival of the Murshidi tradition. Only two songs of Alim were recorded with a gramophone company in 1943, but the forgotten voices and themes come alive in the voices of these women.

 A voice sings of the Hindu flute-playing god : Bohudiner pirit go bondhu eki dine bhengo na... bondhu amar bonshiwala bajaye banshi dupur bela/ami ghore thaki ekela bondhu amar chikon kala (Dont break away in a day from our love of many days My friend who plays the flute My friend, the dark one).

 Singing has never been an easy task for these women. The Islamic society considers this a transgression. Most of the religious representatives say that music is bad for women, says Ratna. But ajaan (the Muslim prayer) is a musical form and that has never been questioned, says 82-year-old Sandesh Bibi. Because its done by a man. 

 Namuna Bibi says: My husband did not like me singing. I left him for that, as I cannot give up my singing. Not all are as brave as her. Many have to give up singing for family. Things werent that bad in our times. Some new namaazis are making things complicated these days, says Sandesh Bibi. 

 The money the women earn depends on how popular the singer is. Sometimes an assignment can fetch them Rs 2,000, which is 10 times the amount that they earn in a month, says Mukherjee.

 For many men, a singing woman is a persona non grata they dont consider her as practising a profession at all. A maulvi from Saler, Murshidabad, explains: Music is not approved by Islam. Women are not supposed to perform in public.

 The tradition, however, is not fading, says Ratna. These women are fighting for their rights and this is a feminist movement in itself. The songs not just say about the rituals but talk about their lives.

 Alert cop foils snatch attempt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A sub-inspector chased a snatcher for 10 minutes through crowded BBD Bag streets to recover a bag containing Rs 1,60,000 on Wednesday. 

 The incident took place around 11.30am near India Exchange Place, when Subodh Mondal, an employee of a private firm, was on his way to the Lyons Range branch of IndusInd bank to deposit the cash.

 Witnesses said the snatcher approached him from behind, grabbed the red handbag containing the money and ran towards Pollock Street. Mondal tried to give chase but fell down. He screamed for help.

 Sub-inspector D.K. Manna was on duty nearby. He immediately ran after the snatcher, who dropped the bag on the road and disappeared into a lane when he could not shake off the cop. 

 Prompt action by Manna helped us recover the money. The snatcher dropped the bag because he realised that he would be arrested, said the deputy commissioner (headquarters), Gyanwant Singh.

 We will reward the sub-inspector for quick action and sincerity, said a senior officer at Lalbazar. 

 Mondal had taken a bus from near his Howrah office around 9.50am for BBD Bag. We are investigating whether some insider tipped off the snatcher. We have interrogated some employees of the firm, said an officer of the detective department.

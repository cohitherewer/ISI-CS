 Bomb scare at Sealdah

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Three days after a crude bomb was found in a packed train compartment at Howrah station, a bomb scare triggered panic at Sealdah station on Tuesday morning.

 Around 11.10 am, passengers in a local train compartment panicked after spotting an unclaimed polythene bag under a seat.

 As they raised an alarm, personnel from the bomb disposal squad and the Government Railway Police (GRP) searched the compartment and found an emergency light in the bag. The panic continued for more than an hour.

 The Howrah scare fresh in their minds, the passengers became suspicious spotting the bag. Our men opened the bag and found an emergency light inside, said Barun Mullick, superintendent of railway police (Sealdah).

 Atanu Haldar, who was in the compartment, recalled that the passengers started jumping off the compartment soon after noticing the bag. It could have led to a stampede. Thankfully, nothing happened, he added.

 A section of passengers, especially daily commuters, alleged lax security at the station. Despite Saturdays bomb haul in Howrah, the securitymen are not checking the bags or luggage thoroughly, said a passenger. Police are mostly busy with long-distance trains, though the local trains are more vulnerable to bomb attacks, said another.

 GRP officers, however, said security will be intensified and that both long-distance and local trains will be scanned. The long-distance trains are being scanned regularly. Now, the local trains will be brought under the cover, said an officer.

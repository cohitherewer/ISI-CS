The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Four weeks for forensic

 A STAFF REPORTER

 McDonalds after the August 12 blast

 The state forensic experts probing the blast at the McDonalds outlet on Park Street have missed their August 31 deadline to submit the report. 

 Sources said the report is likely to be submitted next week, almost a month after the August 12 blast. A committee comprising representatives of police, Central Forensic Science Laboratory and the fire department will go through the report and other inputs to identify the cause of the blast.

 It takes time to carry out tests and reach a conclusion, said Dhurjati Sengupta, the director of the State Forensic Sciences Laboratory, explaining the delay.

 We will table our findings when the committee meets next week. Our observations may vary with that of other experts, he added.

 A 24-year-old pedestrian, a resident of Queens Mansion on Park Street, died and four men were injured in the blast that ripped through the eatery. Glass panes of the restaurant shattered and the shutters were flung across the road under the impact of the explosion.

 Experts from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory had attributed the blast to a leak in an LPG cylinder in the kitchen. The gas caught fire when an employee lit a burner. The fire led to an expansion of air, causing the blast.

 The police agreed with the observation, though the fire department held clogging in the airconditioning ducts responsible for the blast.

 An independent fire expert, who was hired by McDonalds to understand all plausible causes of the blast, has not ruled out the possibility of methane being responsible for the mishap.

 Methane is unlikely to be the cause but it cant be ruled out. If methane accounts for four-five per cent of the gas in a duct, the mixture becomes inflammable, Pratik Kumar Chatterjee, the adviser (fire) to ONGC, told Metro.

 Methane generates from decaying vegetable matter and sewage. The gas produced from sewage has a foul smell, said Chatterjee.

 At McDonalds, he explained, the gas generated from sewage might have travelled upward (it is lighter than air) and entered a closed area, like the air-conditioning ducts that are linked to the atmosphere. The mixture in the duct could be ideal for explosion, said Chatterjee. 

 But in such a situation, the entire duct would have been ripped off. At McDonalds, only a part of the plaster of Paris from the duct had fallen off, pointed out Chatterjee.

 Also, the amount of methane required for such a blast could have been generated if the sewage of entire Park Street was dumped at McDonalds, he said.

 Miniature tradition, mammoth canvas

 SOUMITRA DAS

 A work by Tapas Konar on display

 Huge white figures, which could be Hindu icons, dominate the canvases of Tapas Konar. His works are being exhibited at Akar Prakar.

 These figures have fixed expressions and rigid limbs, like folk toys which, at one time, could be bought at village fairs. These large figures spawn smaller clones to which they are linked by a cable, which could be the umbilical chord.

 They are all engaged in various activities of the everyday kind and of the artistic kind as well. They paint, play musical instruments, take a shower, wash clothes, pray to holy insects, ride bulls like the Minoans, dandle tiny elephants or indulge in violence. 

 It is quite an unlikely mix of activities that could never happen in real life. One does not have to strain ones imagination to realise that these are also sexual beings. 

 But the past, present and the future coexist for Konar, who is deeply interested in ancient texts and tries to relate them to present-day reality.

 Cream, ochre, red and green are the only colours he uses in the background and he often uses space the same way that Indian miniature artists did, even though his canvases are anything but small. At times, he uses touches of very bright, jewel-like colours on these flat surfaces, which accentuate the link of these works with the Indian miniature tradition.

 However, Konar replicates these figures with such regularity and to such an extent that they look quite repetitive. Viewers need a break from monotony, however seriously the artist may be taking himself and his work.

 His drawings, in which he does not hold himself back, are a lot more innovative. The element of fantasy is quite strong here, too, but his figures exude a nervous energy that his icons lack. 

 The space available in these small sheets of paper is quite limited. Yet he introduces a variety of figures often borrowed from indigenous conventions and gives them a twist of his own. He takes a dig at the snobbery of the culture vultures. 

 Some of them are delightfully whimsical, even when their content is prurient.

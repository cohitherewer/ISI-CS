 Mood swings: Figure out the trigger

 - Fast-paced life and cut-throat competition can bring on bipolar mood disorder

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Youve been climbing up the ladder faster than a squirrel, your seniors adore you and your colleagues envy you. But alls not well with your world. You feel on top of the world one moment, sick and suicidal the next. Beware, you may be going the Britney Spears way.

 Bipolar mood disorder is how doctors define the condition. In celeb terms, this is what has landed singing icon Britney Spears (picture in graphic) in trouble from party places to salons to rehabilitation centres.

 With life picking up pace and competition becoming cut-throat, the Calcuttans vulnerability to bipolar mood disorder is growing by the rat-race hour. Bipolar disorder is nothing but extreme mood swings, says Dr Sabyasachi Mitra, consultant neuro-psychiatrist, dealing with a number of such cases. Imagine there are two poles in your mind, one of extreme depression and another of almost manic high energy. When a person oscillates between the two poles, it triggers unusual shifts in mood, energy and ability to function, he explains.

 The three broad reasons for this disorder are biological, social and psychological. And the most vulnerable segment, according to psychiatrists, is engaged in high-pressure jobs in information technology, capital markets, media, advertising and cinema. They are under pressure to live up to expectations and out-perform others that they suffer extreme mood swings. The typical male victim is an achiever in his field and the typical female victim is a mother with a competitive job and lack of support structure at home.

 Those suffering from the disorder can lose their jobs, have relationship problems and even develop a violent streak. Alcohol and substance abuse can aggravate this problem, says general physician Arpan Chaudhuri.

 The two extremes of mood disorder can be treated by administering uppers and downers. Complete treatment requires a concerted effort. Figuring out the trigger is the main thing. The individual has to develop a self-support system with family and friends to fight this mental disorder, says psychiatrist Rima Mukherjee.

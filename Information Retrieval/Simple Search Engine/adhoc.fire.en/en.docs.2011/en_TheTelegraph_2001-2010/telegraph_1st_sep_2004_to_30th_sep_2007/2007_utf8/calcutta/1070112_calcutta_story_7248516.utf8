 So you think the Delhi chill calls for jackets and wraps? The citys style set sure doesnt think so. Flaunting bare backs and long legs in halters and short skirts was the fashion order of the opening evening at Bridal Asia 2007.

 The 11th edition of the annual wedding extravaganza kicked off with a show on Wednesday. The makeshift ramp on the lawns of The Grand looked beautiful, while the open-air venue was dotted with sigris and bukharis to keep away the chill. Steaming mulled wine and apple cider were the warm sips on offer, while finger food like sushi, canape and more gave the guests enough to nibble on.

 Some in the crowd teamed light stoles and shawls with sexy silhouettes to show off their curves; others chose to make a statement in stylish winter wear calf-length jackets, polo necks, high boots.

 On the ramp, bare backs and shoulders were a common sight, while lowers were voluminous and flowing. Bling is the flavour of the wedding season ahead and the show announced it with a bang.

 The show was opened by Preity Zintas favourite designer Surily Goel, followed by Karma, a label from Pakistan. Indian design biggies Malini Ramani and Rina Dhaka wrapped up the evening.

 GoodLife checks out what the first two labels had in store for the winter bride, for her D-Day and her trousseau.

 Pretty pink

 Surily presented two different looks a cocktail line for the trousseau and a bridal collection.

 Pink was her preferred hue and it came in all shades rani, magenta, rose, dirty, pale with some peaches and nudes. The second part of the collection introduced some bright bridal shades like reds, greens and yellows.

 Pink goes very well with Indian skin tones. Plus, it has a pretty and happy feel about it and hence is apt for weddings, explained Surily.

 The cocktail line comprised evening wear dresses, skirts with blouses, kurtas, salwar kameezes and lots of saris, while the bridal one boasted of heavier saris and a couple of lehngas. The saris were teamed with a variety of blouses from halters to corsets to traditional cholis.

 Mother of pearl, corals, shells and light threadwork embellished the cocktail pieces, and the bridals flaunted heavier work with embroidery, coins, metal chips and sequins in different shapes and sizes.

 My collection is for the contemporary bride and all occasions that she may be required to attend a cocktail party or a sangeet. Embroidery is my forte and so theres lots of it, summed up Surily.

 Old-world aura

 Karma, an apparel brand from Pakistan with labels like Karma Pink, Karma Haute Couture and Karma Wedding, was represented by designers Maheen and Kamee.

 The collection from Karma Wedding, a six-month old label, stood out for its traditional Muslim look. The highlights of the line were the dominant silhouettes the sheraras and gararas. 

 The sheraras and gararas are common attires for brides in Pakistan. We decided to bring them to India because theyre distinctly different from what the Indian designers are showcasing and hence have a novelty value, says Maheen.

 The old-world charm is what Maheen feels is the USP of their collection. Though our traditional craft forms are the same, works of Indian designers have a lot of Bollywood influence. We dont have that and hence our work looks more old-world, he reasons.

 The Karma collection also had two parts Decorage, drawing inspiration from the British Raj, and Navratan, influenced by the nine gemstones.

 The Decorage line had a muted colour story of nudes, creams, ivories, pale pinks and peaches. Navratan used brighter jewel colours like blues, yellows, greens and reds.

 The ornamentation was in metallic gold, loaded with traditional embroidery, stones and crystals. Georgettes, chiffons, charmeuse satin with a touch of jamevar made up the fabrics.

 Calcuttas connectivity with Southeast Asia will receive a boost with Air-India launching its budget airlines operations to three countries in the region from next month. 

 Three planes of Air India Express, the national carriers low-cost fleet, will fly thrice a week to Bangkok, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. Thrice-a-week flights will also be started to Dhaka.

 Announcing this on Monday, V. Thulasidas, the chairman and managing director of Air-India, said the Calcutta-Bangkok-Calcutta operations would start on October 7. The one-way fare will be Rs 1,499 plus taxes. The one-way fare to Singapore will be Rs 4,999 plus taxes.

 The other flights to Southeast Asia and Dhaka will also start in October, added Thulasidas.

 The flights will take off from Calcutta around 7 am.

 The flight to Kuala Lumpur would restore service in the sector after more than a year. Malaysia Airlines had stopped city operations in April 2006.

 The tourism industry is buoyant about the new flights. The demand for flights to Southeast Asia is increasing every year. There was a lack of low-cost carriers, which the new flights will fill up, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.

 According to him, the number of passengers to Southeast Asia from the city is increasing by 10 to 15 per cent every year.

 Thulasidas was in the city to inaugurate the airlines Calcutta-Silchar services with A320 aircraft. Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Indian, operates in the Northeast. From September 1, the airlines Boeing 737 operations in the Northeast has been replaced with bigger A320 aircraft, adding more seats. 

 Thulasidas also announced that Air-India would set up a hub in a European airport. We are holding talks with a number of airports and things will be finalised soon, he said. Among the airports are Munich, Vienna and Amsterdam. 

 The Air-India chief said once the hub is set up, a flight would be started to it from Calcutta.

 From there, other carriers will take passengers to various European destinations. Air-Indias own flights will operate to the US and Canada, said Thulasidas.

 Ornaments, cash looted

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Burglars looted Rs 1 lakh in cash and jewellery from Swapan Dass house on Bagpota Road, Sarsuna, in Thakurpukur, on Wednesday night.

 Police said the robbery was detected on Thursday morning, when Dass father-in-law Anadi Ranjan Acharya, who lives next door, alerted the family.

 Das told police that his family had gone to bed around 11 pm on Wednesday. On Thursday morning, they found the main door locked from outside and the almirah open. 

 Police said the burglars had taken away all the ornament boxes and cash worth Rs 1 lakh. Some of the empty ornament boxes were found in the backyard. Officers suspect an insider is involved in the crime. 

 Superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) S.N. Gupta said his men had interrogated a few persons and they hoped to crack the case soon.

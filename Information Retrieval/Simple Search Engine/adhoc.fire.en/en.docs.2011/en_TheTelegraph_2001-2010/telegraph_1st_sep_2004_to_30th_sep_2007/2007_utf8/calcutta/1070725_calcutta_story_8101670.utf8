The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Green vs concrete row

 - Landfill cry sparks bar on building by Merlin

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Heads: Trees and shrubs.

 Tails:

 60 apartments.

 The green versus concrete debate reached a flashpoint on Tuesday with the pollution control appellate authority of West Bengal passing an order barring construction by Merlin Developers off Prince Anwar Shah Road, opposite Navina cinema, where a waterbody was allegedly filled.

 The appellate authority, headed by Justice Gitesh Ranjan Bhattacharjee, acted on the basis of an appeal by resident Chand Kajaria against a pollution control board move.

 The board had dismissed his complaint that Merlin Developers were going ahead with a project for construction of multi-storied housing by or after filling up a tank there.

 Taking cognisance, the appellate authority directed that no construction shall be made on the concerned filled-up land and any construction, if already made, shall be demolished or removed by the present owners/occupiers (Merlin) of that land within two months.

 Merlin has built an estate on an adjoining plot and plans to expand into 2A Prince Bakhtiar Shah Road, the 20-cottah plot under scrutiny, with another residential block of 60 apartments. The collective price tag will be around Rs 10 crore.

 The Corporation and the fisheries department conducted a joint inspection 15 days ago and gave us a clean chit, saying there was no waterbody on the premises, Sushil Mohta, the managing director of Merlin Projects, told Metro.

 We have obtained records from the Corporation dating back to 1968 and nowhere is there a mention of a waterbody. If they come up with reference of a pond that might have existed at the site 100 years ago, its ridiculous in the present context and grossly unfair, said Mohta, adding that the company would challenge the appellate authority in high court.

 Kajaria, the complainant, maintains that the developers filled up a waterbody in end-2004. Referring to a spot inspection in July 2005, the appellate authority observed that the filled-up land was found to be covered with bushes and big trees and directed plantation of adequate number of trees on the filled-up land instead of directing excavation of the tank.

 Both the pollution control board and Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) have been asked to ensure compliance of the order. The authority has appointed Biswajit Mukherjee, a senior law officer in the department of environment, to monitor the matter.

 We will finalise our course of action after receiving the order, said Sushil Sharma, the mayoral council member (environment) of the CMC.

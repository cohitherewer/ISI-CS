 WET VICTIM: A tree uprooted by last weeks deluge on VIP Road. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta

 A record of 69 large roadside trees were uprooted by the showers between Tuesday and Saturday last week. The highest number of trees uprooted in a day was 25, on Thursday, the third day of the deluge. 

 Of the uprooted trees, 65 were Krishnachura and Radhachura. The rest comprised a mahogany, a peepul and two banyan trees. All the trees were between 20 and 25 years old.

 In comparison, in 2006, 47 trees were uprooted, which was the most in a year till last week.

 According to experts of the civic parks and gardens wing, loosening of soil around the roots because of incessant rain caused the trees to topple over.

 The mahogany tree was uprooted in front of the Academy of Fine Arts. The civic civil engineering department removed the tree from the road and loaded it onto a truck. But an assistant engineer of the public works department (PWD) came to the spot and claimed that the tree had been planted by the forest department on PWD land.

 After about two hours of verbal tussle, the civic employees allowed the assistant engineer to take away the logs. 

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay directed deputy chief engineer (civil) Soumitra Bhattacharya to consult horticulturists and submit a report on the uprooting of Krishnachura and Radhachura trees in the city. 

 Mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan said Krishnachura and Radhachura trees should not be planted on the road as their roots are shallow but spread out in different directions. If the roots cannot spread out, the tree topples over. The large and heavy leaves of the two plants also become heavier when wet.

 According to Khan, since the trees grow as tall as 25 feet and most of the city roads are hardly 30 feet wide, it is very difficult to enjoy the beauty of Krishnachura and Radhachura when they are in full bloom.

 To make Calcutta green, my predecessor concentrated only on trees that grow fast. Not much thought was spared for the other factors, added the mayoral council member.

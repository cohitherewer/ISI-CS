 The calm of a Ballygunge neighbourhood has given way to chaos and the residents blame it all on a newly-opened food address.

 Haldiram Food City, spread over four floors and 10,000 sq ft at 24 Ballygunge Park, has unleashed traffic congestion, parking jostle and even filth, allege residents of the area.

 Ours was a peaceful neighbourhood till this Food City came up (on March 27), says Kavita Arora, who lives in Tirumala, a highrise at 35A Ballygunge Park. Visitors to the Food City park their cars in our lane, leaving little space for residents who have been living here for years. The problem is most acute in the evenings on weekdays and throughout the day on weekends, she adds.

 The Food City management, however, denies the charge. We have parking space for 85 cars on our premises. If some people park their cars outside, we cannot be blamed, argues Umed Dharewal, general manager, Haldiram Food City.

 But is space for 85 cars enough? demands a Ballygunge Park resident. Footfall at the Food City confirm it is not. There are around 1,500 visitors on weekdays and 3,000 on weekends, claims Dharewal. The ground floor houses an outlet selling trademark confectionery items, the first floor a 300-seater eatery and the second floor a supermarket. The third and fourth floors are let out for functions.

 Residents of Ballygunge Park often find it tough to get back home during peak hours. At times, it takes close to half-an-hour to enter the lane, there are so many cars parked on both sides, says Prakash Himatsingka of Rajnigandha Apartments, at 25 Ballygunge Park.

 The other grouse is the garbage. At the end of the day, the Food City dumps all its garbage on the pavements. The stench is unbearable in the morning, shudders Himanshu Ajmera, of Orbit Regency, at 29A Ballygunge Park. Dharewal dismisses this charge as well. We follow eco-friendly ways of disposing waste. The garbage is collected in plastic bags and cleared between 4am and 6am, he says. 

 What happens next? If the residents lodge a complaint, we will look into it, says deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim.

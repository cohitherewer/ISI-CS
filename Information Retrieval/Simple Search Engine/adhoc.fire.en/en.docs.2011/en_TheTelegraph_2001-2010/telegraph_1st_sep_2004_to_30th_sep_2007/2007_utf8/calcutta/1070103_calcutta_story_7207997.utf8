 Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, has long been a happy hunting ground for companies looking for the best finance brains. And it might soon be the place to look for the next marketing maverick. 

 The premier B-school has been promoting market research initiatives. One such effort was Census 2006, a market research and analysis festival presented by The Telegraph. The event provided the managers in the making with an opportunity to be part of live industry projects on gauging customer satisfaction, estimating brand awareness, perception and loyalty and studying of customer attitudes and usage habits.

 IIM Calcutta has always been known for its stronghold on finance. We are making an effort to strengthen the marketing aspect through initiatives like Census, said second-year student Ashok Kumar. 

 Working for companies like ITC, Tata Tea and the RPG group, the students of IIM Calcutta organised a data collection fair, Ulhaas, on December 30 and December 31 at 22 Camac Street.

 We tried to give a carnival feel to the affair so that the respondents could enjoy themselves while taking part in the data collection games, stated Kumar. Data on a wide range of products was collected through seven specially-structured games of an average duration of seven to 10 minutes. Other attractions of the fest were Housie, Antakshari, song dedications and fun quizzes.

 Games like Welcome to Ramgarh involved characters of the movie Sholay, like Gabbar, Basanti, Veeru, Jai, Mausi and Dhanno. Kaun Banega Crorepati 3 used the theme of the popular Amitabh Bachchan television quiz show. The game consisted of six rounds. Every round had a different setting so as to give a feel of many games in one game.

 The data provided by the people were fed into a computer. A specially-devised software decided which of the games the participant was eligible to play, based on his/her demographic profile. 

 Each respondent on an average had to play three to four games. Though the process was time-consuming, the response was very good, said Ankit Gupta, another second-year student.

 The data will be analysed using modern statistical techniques. Based on the findings, the teams will prepare reports, which will then be submitted to the respective companies. We expect to wrap up the process by mid-January, said Kumar.

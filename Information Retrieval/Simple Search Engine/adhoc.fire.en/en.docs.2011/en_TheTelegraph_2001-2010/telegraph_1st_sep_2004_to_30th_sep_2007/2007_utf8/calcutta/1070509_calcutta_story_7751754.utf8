 A division bench of Calcutta High Court directed the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) on Tuesday to adhere to certain guidelines of the Institute of Public Health and Hygiene (IPHH), following complaints by an environmentalist against contamination in the drinking water supplied by the corporation. 

 The bench, comprising Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.C. Ghosh, mentioned that the HMC would have to perform the following tasks:

 nIdentify the spots where leakage and contamination occurs in the water pipes 

 nCarry out water quality assessment in all places where water is supplied

 nConduct sanitary surveys to find out the root causes of contamination 

 nCheck residual chlorine accumulation in all dead-end tap points. 

 nCarry out immediate chlorination if the residual chlorine is found below 0.2 mg for 1 mg of water at any point.

 Diptarup Kahalia, assistant professor, department of sanitary engineering of IPHH, attended the court on Tuesday to represent IPHH director Nandini Chakraborty. On Monday, the court had summoned Chakraborty for her opinion.

 Kahalia opined that some immediate measures should be taken to provide bacteria-free water to Howrah citizens.

 Responding to the petition moved by environment activist Subhas Dutta, the court had asked the HMC to file an affidavit with regard to the petitioners allegation.

 In its affidavit, the HMC admitted that the potable water supplied by it was not up to the mark and cited vacancies and shortage of staff to carry out water purification drives. The vacancies should be immediately filled and the courts decision implemented, the chief justice told HMC lawyer D.P. Mukherjee.

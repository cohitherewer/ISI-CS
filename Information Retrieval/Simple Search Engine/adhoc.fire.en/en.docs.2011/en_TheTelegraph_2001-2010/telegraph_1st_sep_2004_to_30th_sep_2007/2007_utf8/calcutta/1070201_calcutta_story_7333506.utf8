 They feature in big-budget celebrations on New Years eve and dandiya nights, but we hardly see them hoisting the Tricolour or paying tribute to a statesman on any occasion. I tried to find out whether Republic Day has any significance in the lives of our celebrities. Heres how they spent the day this year.

 BIPASHA BASU, actress

 To say the truth, Republic Day passes like any other day for me. But as far as its importance is concerned, I am as much of an Indian as any of you. Hence, days like Independence Day and Republic Day are close to my heart. We all love our country a lot and should never forget our roots.

 RITUPARNA SENGUPTA, actress

 Republic Day is an importance occasion which makes us remember our identity as Indians. I watch the live telecast of the Republic Day parade in New Delhi. If Im in Calcutta, Im always invited to some or the other programme to mark the occasion. I make it a point not to miss them.

 PALLAVI CHATTERJEE, actress

 I dont think Republic Day is of much significance in the lives of todays youngsters. People look forward to the day as a holiday. This maybe because of the lifestyle we lead. I watch the parade on Red Road whenever I am in town. But watching it in Delhi is a different experience altogether. As a child, I remember hoisting our national flag on Republic Day as well as Independence Day.

 SABA KARIM, cricketer

 Independence Day and Republic Day are very significant in our lives as they highlight the fact that we are an integral part of the nation. It makes us proud to be Indians. These days ensure that we learn to value the unity that resides within the diversity in our country. The parade is a recapitulation of our rich culture. Though I spend these days like any other day, I do sit with my family and watch the parade in Delhi on television, while explaining it to my kids.

 PRIYANSHU CHATTERJEE, actor

 For GeNext, Republic Day is not more than another holiday. They hang around with friends not realising the importance of the days when we can feel pride in being Indians. I belong to the same generation myself and do not do anything special on the day. This year, my parents were with me on Republic Day. My father, who never misses the parade on television, makes me sit and watch it with him.

 Math skills for a lifetime

 January 21 was a field day for young math freaks in the city. The second Universal Concept Mental Arithmetic System (UC MAS) West Bengal Abacus and Mental Arithmetic Competition saw 1196 kids battling it out to the twirling of abacus beads at the St Xaviers College auditorium.

 The contestants, students of UC MAS, were divided into three categories up to eight years, eight to 11 years, and more than 11 years. The students competed from levels one to eight depending on their proficiency. N. Anand, director, UC MAS, West Bengal, said: There are 10 levels but we have been able to conduct training only till the eighth level so far.

 The students had to solve about 200 sums in eight to 10 minutes. The first three levels included addition and subtraction, involving the use of the abacus, while the following levels which involved multiplication and subtraction required mental arithmetic entirely.

 The purpose of this programme is to train children in lifetime skills abilities which once mastered are never forgotten. Through the mental arithmetic techniques, students acquire greater concentration, memory, speed and time management, said Anand. UC MAS is affiliated to World Abacus Association of Mental Arithmetic, China, and has about 40 branches in West Bengal.

 Manjima Mahalanobish, who was one of the winners in the fourth level and studies in Class IV at Carmel Primary School, said: Math is my favourite subject. I was quite certain that I would make it to the next level. I had practised keeping that in mind. Manjima had competed at the national level last year.

 UC MAS holds classes once a week for two hours at its centres in the city. Manjimas father, Anupam Mahalanobish, said: With the use of calculators, we had forgotten how to do sums mentally. This course puts my daughter in touch with those skills. But more than math, it has also improved her reasoning abilities. He added: I got her admitted to UCMAS to nurture her love for math, though I wonder how long she will be able to continue it, given the pressure of studies. It is actually like a stress reliever for her, and she is always ready for her classes, even on a Sunday morning.

 Twenty-four winners, three from each of the eight categories, will participate in the national finals in Chennai in August. Finalists from 24 states will be a part of the contest. Thirty winners from the national level will participate in the international finals to be held in Kuala Lumpur in December.

 The Diary

 To those who fell apart

Come let us fly this world.

 The world where Nick and Eugene,

 And many more fell like ropes.

 And even Daniel was sliced through mercilessly.

 Let us fly this place it is too wet and noisy.

 And even then a vein might be cut,

 And innocent blood spilt again.

 Now that I have seen it all,

 Sing not a lullaby to make me sleep.

 But tell tales of pain and suffering,

 That will make me neurotic. 

 Let me gift a white rose, lest the red one

 makes me think of blood again.

 Have a little patience,

 This will change. It is changing.

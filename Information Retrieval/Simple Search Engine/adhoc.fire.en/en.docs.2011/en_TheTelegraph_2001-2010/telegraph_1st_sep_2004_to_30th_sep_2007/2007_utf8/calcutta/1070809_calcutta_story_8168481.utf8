 Civic plot to be returned 

 - Stock exchange deal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The prospect of the civic body getting back a 10-acre EM Bypass plot from Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE) brightened on Wednesday, with the two organisations reaching an out-of-court settlement with the help of the state government.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) leased the plot beside ITC Sonar Calcutta to the CSE 12 years ago, for Rs 1,45,400 per cottah.

 At a meeting at Writers Buildings on Wednesday, attended by chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, it was decided that the CSE would withdraw the suit it had filed in this regard. The CMC will refund the money it had taken for half of the plot to the CSE. The other five acres will be auctioned. Sixty per cent of the proceeds will go to the CSE. 

 Among others present at the meeting are the principal secretary of commerce and industry, Sabyasachi Sen, and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 I am happy that in the greater interest of the city, an out-of-court settlement has been reached, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya. He thanked the chief minister and said the deal would not have been possible without his intervention.

 The CSE had moved court against the CMC after former municipal commissioner Debasish Som, in a letter in 2004, demanded the plot back as the stock exchange had failed to utilise it. 

 The money the civic body will get by auctioning half the plot will be used as its share of funds under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. 

 The CSE has dropped the plan to shift the stock exchange from India Exchange Place to EM Bypass for the moment. The state infrastructure development corporation is looking for land near the Park Circus connector to expand the permanent fairground.

 Father-in-law in suicide net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Preeti Vermas father-in-law, the only person in the family believed not to have been involved in the homemakers suicide, was arrested on Tuesday. 

 We have rounded up Har Verma, 72, to find out the whereabouts of the accused who are absconding, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

 A neighbour said: Since yesterday, we have been keeping an eye on Har Verma. He is a good man, but we wanted to ensure he does not run away, like most members of his family. We gave him food, water and whatever else he required.

 The womans body was taken to Ranchi by brother Amit Kumar Burman, who is settled there. The last rites were performed on Tuesday morning.

 Preeti, 32, hanged herself in her G-504 apartment in Green Valley estate, in Kaikhali, early on Sunday. She had left a suicide note naming husband Sanjay, 35, and mother-in-law Savitri.

 Neighbours, however, said Sanjays alleged homosexual relationship with cousin Manoj had forced the woman to end her life. Manoj had even accompanied the couple on their honeymoon.

 Amit has lodged an FIR naming Sanjay, Savitri, Manoj and wife Mani, and Ajay, another brother-in-law of Preeti, as accused. 

 Sanjay and Manoj have been arrested and are in judicial custody.

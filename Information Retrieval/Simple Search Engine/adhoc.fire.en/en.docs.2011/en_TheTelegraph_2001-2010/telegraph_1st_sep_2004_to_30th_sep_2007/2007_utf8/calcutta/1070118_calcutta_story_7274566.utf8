 Scout Anil Harishchandra: Mystery deepens

 The case of the mysterious death of 15-year-old Scout Anil Harishchandra took a dramatic turn on Wednesday, with the police deciding to perform a DNA test of the remains of his badly-decomposed and disfigured body to clear all doubts about its identity. 

 Anils father and two uncles had identified his body and performed his last rites on Tuesday. 

 We decided to perform the DNA test to make sure the body was actually the boys. This is what his relatives have demanded. We have initiated a murder case, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24 Parganas). 

 Initially, Anils family had failed to identify the body, but the next day, they did so by some marks on his body and an amulet he wore.

 We want to clear all doubts about the identity, as the body may not be of a teenager, said a police officer. 

 According to police, the preliminary post-mortem report indicated that the body was not of a boy. After conducting ossification tests of the bones, forensic experts concluded that the body was that of a 25-year-old youth.

 The preliminary report states that the youth died around 11 am, and there was little food in his stomach, which indicates that he might not have eaten a big meal before he died. We have preserved his viscera and a part of his intestine for a more detailed test, said the officer.

 Earlier, the Scout camp leaders had said Anil was seen in the camp site till 1.30 pm, post-lunch on January 8.

 Anils relatives on Wednesday morning went to Rajarhat police station and lodged a petition demanding interrogation of the three teachers of the municipal school in Mumbai, who escorted the Scouts to the national jamboree at Rajarhat between January 2 and 7. They left town without informing police or Anils family on Monday.

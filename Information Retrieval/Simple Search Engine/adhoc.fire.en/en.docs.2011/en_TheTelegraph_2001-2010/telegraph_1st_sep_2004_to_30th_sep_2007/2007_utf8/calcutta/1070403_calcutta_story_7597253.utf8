 Promising dreams

Seven young students of Jadavpur Universitys mass communication department have joined hands to make films on the institute. The offerings are titled Promise of Life (12.28 minutes) and With the Dreams of Light (30.54 minutes). 

 While the former is about the National Service Scheme in the university, the latter provides a detailed history of the evolution of the institute from a college dedicated to producing intellectuals who would serve the country to one of the premier universities in the country. Directed by Parag Sen (extreme left in picture above), the films have been produced by the university for Rs 50,000. 

 The films have voiceovers by Ananda Lal, a professor at the English department of the university. While Promise of Life leaves a lot to be desired, the other film brings alive the vision that led to the formation of the institution. The film tells us that it was the National Council of Education, formed in 1906, which came up with the idea of an educational institution where quality would be the buzzword. 

 The film also highlights the current activities of the university, from winning the Nippon Foundation International Award that promotes research in social sciences and humanities, to the canteen culture that students hold dear. 

 According to Sounak Sengupta, one of the crew members, the team is hoping to screen the films at Public Relations Society of India and at International Social Communication Cinema Conference at Nandan.

 Our next documentary is on the non-toxic herbal abir, the brainchild of Siddhartha Dutta, former head of the chemical engineering department in the university. The shoot is almost complete. We plan to screen the film at Vatavaran, the film festival at India Habitat Centre, New Delhi, said Sengupta.

 For a green cause

 Shirin Begum (picture by Aranya Sen) and Raju Rehman Prasad are quick with their fingers. In a matter of minutes, they can fashion flowers out of synthetic clay.

 But Shirin is different from an average child: she is deaf and dumb. At a workshop organised by Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM), she and other physically challenged children joined in with gusto. 

 Organised in collaboration with the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (PCB) and state department of environment, the campaign began on March 30 on the BITM premises. 

 Roughly divided into four phases, it is a year-long programme aided by PCB. The campaign started in 2004. We have been organising the programme with financial support from the PCB to raise environmental awareness among children, said Jayanta Sthanapati, director, BITM. More than 100 students from various organisations participated in the programme. 

 Competitive events like open house quiz, touch and find, smell and guess, clay modelling and painting made for a full day. We design the events specially for these children after consulting the WBPCB, informed the director. 

 Institutes like Manovikas Kendra Rehabilitation and Research Institute for the Handicapped, Day Care Centre and Calcutta Deaf and Dumb School participated in the competitive items. Thirty-three children from our institute participated for the first time, informed Shyamashree Chakravorty, teacher, Manovikash Kendra.

 In the valediction and prize distribution ceremony, the successful candidates in the yearlong environment-related events were given awards. Our calendar ends in March. The next year we are planning to take our programme to districts, said Sthanapati.

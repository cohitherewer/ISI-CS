 Cop alert on help

 PRONAB MONDAL

 The Lalbazar police headquarters recorded 12 cases of theft in April that were committed by domestic help. And 56 such cases were registered in the past four months. Every year, nearly 500 people are robbed by their domestic help, according to the police.

 In the wake of this increasing incidence of crime by servants, the police department has flashed a warning message: Citizens have to shed their indifference to reporting the details of their domestic help to the police.

 Said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department): If citizens do not provide us with the details of the persons they are recruiting as servants, the possibility of recovering the stolen articles and money is minimised.

 The incident at Ballygunge last Monday is a case in point. Dayashankar, alias Ramprasad one of the burglars the city police are looking forrobbed his employer Aloke Saraogi of Rs 15 lakh. Earlier, he had stolen gold and platinum jewellery from a sharebrokers house.

 Had the employers informed us about recruiting Dayashankar, we could have arrested him before the crimes had been actually committed, said an officer of the Ballygunge police station.

 The helps often played a pivotal role in a number of cases where the theft was carried out by burglars from outside. quot;During the investigation of such cases, we found that the domestic help had provided information to the professional thieves, said Singh.

 If an employer contacts us with the name and address of his would-be servant, we can easily cross-check the information. Even if the person comes from another state, we can contact our colleagues to verify the particulars contained in the information. It would then be easy to discern if anyone is coming to work with a false address or credentials, said an officer of the detective department.

 People hardly come forward to provide information relating to their helps, until an actual robbery takes place at their residences. But then, there are a dearth of clues necessary to track the culprit, added the officer.

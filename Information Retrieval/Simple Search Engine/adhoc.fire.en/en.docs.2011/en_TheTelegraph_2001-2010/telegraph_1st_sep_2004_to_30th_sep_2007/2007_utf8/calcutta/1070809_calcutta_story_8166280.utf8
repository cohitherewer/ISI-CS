 Malicious madness

 A play about communal riots, ? (Question Mark) confronts us with the brutal, cruel face of political leadership in our country. To satisfy their own greedy, selfish ends, our leaders create an imaginary enemy and poison the minds of the masses, compelling them to fear and hate the so-called enemy. And the most lethal weapon they use for the purpose is religion. In the play, Raj, Raza, Mohan and Kanti are four mentally challenged patients who live under the care of a widow, Mrs Rajendra, in an ashram. Their speech and actions are devoid of any logic, at least from the perspective of rational people. Yet, our leaders, who represent the most sane and sensible amongst us all, also behave in a way that is nothing short of madness. The manner in which they manipulate religion is no less absurd or maniacal than the pretentious game of cricket played by Raj and Raza. Drama: Ismail Choonara. Design and direction: S.M. Azhar Alam.

 Event: Play in Hindi, ?, (Question Mark), produced by Little Thespian When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Girish Mancha

 Creating fragments of reality

 A statistician by profession, B.R. Panesar found his pursuit of science transform into his love and commitment for life. Even as a scholar, Panesar searched for and found the medium that could satisfy his inner quest. His paintings are lucid, dynamic and expressive: a projection of his soulful involvement with the world around him. The exhibition features his landscapes, where he creates a space where he can project the melancholy melody which is our present globalised reality. In these paintings, some tiny form appears animal or human augmenting the pathos of the deserted terrain.Through his landscapes, he builds up a tragic consciousness that civilisation is undergoing at present. The works are done in both acrylic and pastel on canvas and paper.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by B.R Panesar When: Till September 12; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Gallery K2, Supra Court,35 Lansdowne Terrace

 Dacoits fought off but fingers at risk

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Indrani Gangopadhyay: Picture of courage

 A 32-year-old schoolteacher fought four armed youths to protect her husband and prevent a dacoity in their Garia flat on Saturday night. 

 In the process, Indrani Gangopadhyay sustained serious injuries on her hands, and amputation of three of her fingers is a distinct possibility. Till late on Sunday, the doctors treating Indrani were not sure if the fingers can be saved. 

 The teachers courage forced the dacoits to return empty-handed.

 The gang walked up to the second-floor flat after smashing the lock on the main entrance of the highrise, Namita, off Garia Station Road. The security guard of the building had quit a few days ago. 

 The youths then broke the lock on the collapsible gate of the flat, before using a concrete chunk to prise open the wooden door of the flat that Atanu Gangopadhyay and his family had moved into only months back. 

 The gang members first stepped into the room where Indranis mother Sati, around 60-plus was sleeping. When the youths tried to open the locked almirah, Sati screamed for help.

 Two of the men tied my arms and legs, while the other two gagged me. Then they threw me on the bed and started beating me. I could barely make any noise, recounted Sati. Atanu and Indrani were asleep in the next room with their 11-year-old daughter Oindrila. Awakened by Satis muffled cries, the CESC officer rushed to the other room.

 The youths held him by the collar and demanded the keys to the almirah. When Atanu refused, the dacoits threatened to hit him with a chopper and even shoot him.

 It was then that my mother stepped in and tried to save my dad. One of the men, a tall, dark man, hit her with a chopper. My mother started screaming for help as blood oozed out of her fingers, recounted Oindrila.

 Other residents of the building reacted to Indranis cries and came out of their flats, prompting the youths to beat a retreat. They scampered down the stairs and disappeared after scaling the boundary wall. It does not appear that they have taken away anything, Sati stated.

 South 24-Parganas police have launched a probe into the incident. The gang had raided the house on a tip-off. It will take us some time to obtain leads on the members, said additional superintendent of district police D.P. Singh.

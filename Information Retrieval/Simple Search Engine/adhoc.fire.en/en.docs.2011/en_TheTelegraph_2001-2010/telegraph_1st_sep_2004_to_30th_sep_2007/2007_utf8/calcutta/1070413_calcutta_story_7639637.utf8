The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Traffic crawl on bridge

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Repairs on Bally bridge are causing traffic snarls on BT Road. A Telegraph picture 

 A vital link in the north between the city and Howrah is under repair, inconveniencing thousands of commuters. 

 Only one flank of Bally bridge, which connects Bally in Howrah with Dunlop in Calcutta, is now open, resulting in enormous traffic snarls. The work is expected to be completed by Poila Baisakh, on April 15.

 RSP legislator from Baranagar and former public works department (PWD) minister Amar Chowdhury on Thursday called on current PWD minister Kshiti Goswami to apprise him of the problems faced by commuters, since the repairs began on Wednesday.

 Goswami said he would shortly convene a meeting with the officials of the National Highway Authorities of India (NHAI) to expedite repairs on the bridge. The minister said he had told the NHAI project director that traffic snarls are spreading to BT Road and GT Road, on both sides of the bridge, due to the repairs.

 Built in 1932, the steel bridge had needed repair for a long time. One of the steel girders, near the Bally-end of the bridge, had developed a crack, raising concerns about the health of the structure. 

 We noticed that the girder was badly damaged and that sand and other material were falling off the bridge. The crack became so wide that the river could be seen through it. We realised that the bridge required proper repair work, said Howrah district magistrate Khalil Ahmed. 

 Before the authorities started the repair work, they said there would be no traffic disruption on the bridge. But the repairs have brought traffic almost to a standstill over the past two days. 

 There was a huge traffic snarl last night. It is unlikely that things would change for the better over the next few days, said a senior officer of Baranagar police station.

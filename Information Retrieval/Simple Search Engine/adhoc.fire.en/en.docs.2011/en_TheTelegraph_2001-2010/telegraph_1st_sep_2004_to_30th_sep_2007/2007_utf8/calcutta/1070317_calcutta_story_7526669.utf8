The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Budget bar on billboard

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Measures to prevent visual pollution figured prominently in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) budget, presented by mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya on Friday. The civic body has decided that it will no longer allow billboards to be erected covering trees, on waterbodies and around heritage structures or city landmarks.

 Despite pulling down billboards in the BBD Bag area, the revenue on this head has gone up this year. This has emboldened us to take more stringent measures against billboards, explained the mayor.

 Among the sops was the decision to make the civic forms available on the Internet for free. The forms can be downloaded from the CMCs website from next month.

 There has been no hike in tax in the Rs 2,233.69-crore deficit budget, except for the amusement levy on machines used for online lotteries. 

 However, the mayor also announced the installation of water meters in houses, indicating collection of water taxes. In his speech, Bhattacharyya stressed on the necessity of collecting charges for supply of filtered water. 

 The mayor also unveiled a three-tier programme for the makeover of the city through private-public-partnership. 

 The plan envisages refurbishment of existing infrastructure of utility services, upgrade of basic infrastructure and large-scale e-governance for better monitoring of administration and delivery of services to citizens.

 The mayor did not come up with any significant scheme for upgrade of slums.

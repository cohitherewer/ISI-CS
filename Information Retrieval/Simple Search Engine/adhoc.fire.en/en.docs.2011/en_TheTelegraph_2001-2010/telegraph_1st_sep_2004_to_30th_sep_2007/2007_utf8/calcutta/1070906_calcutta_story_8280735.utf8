 A fire broke out at an eatery on Sashi Bhushan Dey Street, in central Calcutta, on Wednesday afternoon. 

 Police said a leak in a cooking gas cylinder caused the blaze.The fire broke out following a leak in a cylinder. Three employees suffered burns and were admitted to hospital, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 We have started a case of negligence against the owner of the eatery, he added. A fire department official said the eatery had not taken the basic safety measures.

 Panic gripped the locality, after local residents spotted smoke billowing from the restaurant, Seha, on the ground floor of a six-storeyed building. 

 We immediately alerted the building residents, said Ashok Das, who stays in the area. Six fire tenders took 45 minutes to douse the blaze.

 Eatery owner Elizabeth Rozario refused to comment.

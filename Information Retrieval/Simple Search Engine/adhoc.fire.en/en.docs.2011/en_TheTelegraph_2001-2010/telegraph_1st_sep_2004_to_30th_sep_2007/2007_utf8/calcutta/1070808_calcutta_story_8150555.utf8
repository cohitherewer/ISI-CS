 Tips to age with grace 

 A STAFF REPORTER

Life expectancy has gone up almost twice in India since Independence. So has age-related problems.

 The problems of old age and how to counter and prevent them was the theme of the XXI Annual Scientific Conference of Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan, held at the newly-commissioned Adhish Chandra Sinha Memorial Building from August 3 to 5.

 Ageing gracefully was the theme of the three-day conference, inaugurated by Swami Atmapriyananda, vice-chancellor of Swami Vivekananda Deemed University. Around 500 delegates from across India and abroad attended the conference. Swami Sarvalokananda, the secretary of the hospital, was the patron.

 Life expectancy at birth was 34 in 1947. Now, it has almost become double. The geriatric population has increased and with it, old-age problems, said Sabyasachi Gon, the organising secretary of the conference.

 Hormonal disorders and osteoporosis are among the most common problems faced by aged women, while men mostly suffer from prostrate gland complications. The conference deliberated on how to prevent these diseases and treat them, said Gon.

 Garry Warne, a paediatric endocrinologist from Australia, spoke about the common hormonal problems in children. C. Palanivelu, the president of the Association of Surgeons of India, delivered the Swami Dayananda Memorial Oration. Swami Dayananda had founded the hospital.

 A two-day physiotherapy seminar-cum-workshop was held at the hospital on August 3 and 4.

 The seminar was on management of low back pain without surgical intervention, while the workshop was on chest physiotherapy, said Alok Roychowdhury, the organiser of the programme.

 City-based neuro-surgeon Sandip Chatterjee spoke on low back pain management.

 The cricket World Cup 2007 is off to a rocking start, both at home and abroad.

 While singers Shaggy and Faye-Ann Lyons belted out The Game of Love and Unity at the opening ceremony in Jamaica, the Bangla bands are matching the crooners at the Caribbean island beat for beat.

 Bands in Bengal, both big and small, are busy churning out tracks cheering Dravids boys. Jowar is one of them. It has recorded a song encouraging the boys in blue to bring home the Cup.

 The song is called Team India. It is an amalgamation of calypso and folk. We have used the names of all the players in the Indian squad in the lyrics, said keyboard player and backing vocalist of Jowar Debmalya Banerjee.

 From the soccer World Cup to Souravs exclusion from Team India, the six-member groups lyrics often deal with matters sporting. In todays fast-paced world, everything has become issue-based. The common man identifies with what he has been reading in the papers or watching on television. This is the reason we try to sing about issues that are on the minds of the listeners, says lead vocalist of Jowar Goutam Brahmo.

 The groups album, comprising the Team India number, hits the stores this week. 

 Among the bigger bands, Chandrabindoo already has a hit cricket song Khelchey Sachin, which was popular during the last World Cup. The group does not plan a new song for this edition of the tournament, but will revamp Khelchey Sachin. It has become Khelchey Dada, after Sourav Gangulys smashing return to form and Team India.

 Thats not all. Chandrabindoo has also tied up with a cellphone service provider to compose a special caller tune for the Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 He who walks tall on telly

 Familiar faces from the small screen voice their opinion on whether Shah Rukh Khan can fill the shoes of Amitabh Bachchan as the host of Kaun Banega Crorepati

 Screen On amp; Off

 Shah Rukh Khan relaxing in his chalet during a break from KBC shooting 

 Deven Bhojani (Gattu from Baa Bahoo Aur Baby): I am excited and very enthusiastic about seeing the new season of KBC. We have all seen and watched Amitabh Bachchan and now that Shah Rukh is the host, it gives us all the more reason to watch KBC. SRK has got the style as well as the panache. I am an SRK fan and I would love to see Mr Bachchan in the hot seat opposite SRK on KBC.

 Ronit Roy (Rishabh Bajaj from Kasautii Zindagii Kay and Mihir from Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi): Well, we all loved KBC when Mr Bachchan hosted the show. Shah Rukh Khan will give KBC a different face and KBC will have a different energy altogether. 

 It will be a little more casual now with loads of wit and humour. Shah Rukh Khan has got an excellent sense of humour and it will be nice to see a KBC that is different from the earlier one. I would love to see Smriti (Irani) in the hot seat opposite SRK. I am a fan of SRK. In fact you can say that I am inspired by the way he talks and conducts himself.

 Mouni Roy (Krishna Tulsi from Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi): Well, I am very fond of Shah Rukh Khan. I think off-screen hes a better speaker and carries himself well. I would definitely love to see Rani Mukherjee in the hot seat facing SRK. I make it a point to watch all his movies and, of course, Id love to be sitting opposite SRK!

 Vivaan Bhatena (Dhruv from Kumkum): I think hes the most apt person to replace Mr Bachchan. He will add a new freshness to KBC and I am sure viewers will have something to look forward to. There will be sheer excitement amongst the viewers. I wasnt a big fan of Shah Rukh until I met him in Malaysia for a charity event. The way he interacted with the kids despite nursing an injury on his leg... He does not need to do all of this but yet he does it of his own free will. Thats when I got to see another side of SRK altogether.

 Salil Ankola (Mahen from Karam Apnaa Apnaa): Shah Rukh Khan is a brilliant person and its really great to know that he is the next host of KBC. He has got a different style altogether and one cannot compare him to somebody else. He is unique. The way he projects himself. Id love to be in the hot seat opposite SRK. Who wouldnt?

 Gautam Rode (Lucky from Lucky): Well, Shah Rukh Khan is great! He will do wonders for KBC. People will have something new to look out for on KBC. I am a big SRK fan and of course Id love to see myself in the hot seat facing SRK.

 Rucha Gujarati (Suhana from Bhabhi): Well, SRK taking over the role of KBC host after Amitabh is a difficult task. But Shah Rukh will give KBC a new face value altogether. KBC I think now would be light-hearted and humourous instead of the tense and strict atmosphere it earlier had. I would love to see Amitabh in the hot seat facing Shah Rukh. That would be an episode worth watching.

 I am a die-hard SRK fan. In fact I have watched Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge nearly 30-40 times! I love his acting and I feel he is perfect for romance. If Im seated opposite Shah Rukh, Id be completely hypnotised... Instead of winning some prize money Id come back with a big zero!

 Manoj Bohra (Prem from Kasautii Zindagii Kay): Well, Shah Rukh definitely appeals to todays generation. I think he is the right person to host KBC after Mr Bachchan. Hes energetic, witty and hell add a lot more zest to the show. 

 Id be waiting to see AB in the hot seat opposite SRK. Well, I am an SRK fan, but I dont want to be facing Shah Rukh because I dont want to come face-to-face with him on a non-fictional show. I have bigger plans!

 Pulkit Samrat (Lakshya from Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi): Shah Rukh is very different. He has his own unique style, a great stylish look and a fantastic personality So one can expect the best from him. I am an SRK fan and Id definitely like to see myself with him in the hot seat for KBC.

 Prachee Shah (Kesar from Kesar): Mr Bachchan is Mr Bachchan and Shah Rukh is Shah Rukh. Im a huge Bachchan fan but that doesnt mean I dont like SRK. Shah Rukh is young and has a different image. It will be a good change. 

 Im sure he will have a new look and I would love to see him on television after such a long break. I have worked with Shah Rukh in the Kamal Haasan movie Hey Ram where we had a song-and-dance sequence together. Hes a gentleman and Id definitely love to be in the hot seat facing him some day.

 Buzz-worthy Blanchett

 She has three brilliant performances going into the awards season and she will soon play the Virgin Queen and Bob Dylan! Yet, CATE BLANCHETT talks about giving it up

 Cate Blanchett with Brad Pitt in Babel 

 In New York to promote Notes on a Scandal, one of three films starring the Australian actress, she spoke about her latest buzz-worthy roles and the time of year she calls the real silly season for its frenzy of nominations.

 Swallowing bites of lunch between questions, Cate Blanchett was simultaneously trying to calm down her two young children, who could be heard squealing in the background, jet-lagged after a marathon flight from their home in Sydney (14 hours to Los Angeles, then five more to Manhattan, after a layover). I think it is the worst flight to do with children, she says.

 Such multi-tasking doesnt seem to faze the 37-year-old Blanchett, who recently made her directorial debut with a revival of Harold Pinters A Kind of Alaska at the Sydney Theatre Company. Along with her husband, playwright Andrew Upton, who directed David Mamets Reunion, Blanchett will take over as the co-artistic director of the theatre beginning in 2008, allowing herself three months off each year to pursue outside projects.

 Rather than seeing this as a renunciation of film work, Blanchett thinks of it as a welcome return to normalcy. A lot of sane actors only do one job a year anyway, she points out, calling the move a reconnection with the creative community that were from. Shes looking forward to settling down and educating her children in one place. Itll be exotic, she jokes, of her future sedentary life. Its wildly exotic to me.

 An odd sentiment, perhaps, coming from someone who can be seen currently playing a married British high school teacher who has an affair with a 15-year-old student (Notes on a Scandal); an American tourist who is accidentally shot while vacationing in Morocco (Babel); and a German woman who turns to prostitution in post-World War II Berlin (The Good German).

 Blanchett has described the part of Sheba in Scandal as the hardest journey of connection she has ever had with a character. Part of it was what the actress calls the characters desire to be exposed, an impulse that goes against the grain of Blanchetts natural desire for privacy. My problem is Im not an exhibitionist. Thats why Im always saying Ill give it up. It takes a lot for me to get up in front of other people and do it.

 Beyond that, Blanchett was powerfully turned off by the whole idea of a grown woman having sex with a boy. I think I was surprised at how strongly morally repugnant the whole thing was to me, she says, careful to add that she doesnt have to identify with a character to take a part. Im not an actress who feels that I have to relate the characters experience to my own life, because... thats a very reductive way to think about a character.

 The fly

 Character, in fact, isnt typically the primary thing that draws her to a project. Rather, she says, shes interested in how she can contribute to the work as a whole. Thats largely what persuaded her to take the part of Susan in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus Babel, an invitation she initially resisted because the character spends 95 per cent of her screen time moaning and bleeding on the floor of a hut. It became a bit of a running joke with Alejandro, Blanchett says, recalling that she would turn up in the same room in the village and say, Where do you want me today? Oh, I guess youll be wanting me in the corner, covered in blood, lying on the mat.

 It was only a three-week shoot, but an intense and physically demanding one in the middle of the desert. The surreal low point came when she realised that the crew was pouring real meat juice on her to attract flies. At one point, I saw this fellow with an old water bottle with a whole lot of blow flies buzzing around it, and I realised he was the fly wrangler, who would release the flies on cue to be attracted to the wound.

 The acting muscles exercised in that part How many shades of red can I paint? How many definitions of pain can I underline? is how Blanchett characterises it were the complete antithesis of those utilised in The Good German, a plot-oriented, black-and-white thriller the actress calls very front-footed and external.

 In addition to Blanchetts three movies in theatres, she has three on the horizon one pairing her with Babel co-star Brad Pitt in director David Finchers The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, a romantic fantasy about a man who is growing younger; the Virgin Queen in Shekhar Kapurs The Golden Age; and one of several actors playing Bob Dylan yes, Bob Dylan in Im Not There.

 In that last film, a gloriously insane idea due out next year from the screwball brain of Todd Haynes, she says, Blanchett shares screen time with Richard Gere, Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and others, playing several different aspects of the singer-songwriter. Blanchett plays the mid-1960s, electric Dylan.

 A challenge? Sure, but nothing she cant handle. I think the more Ive done, the less anxious Ive become.

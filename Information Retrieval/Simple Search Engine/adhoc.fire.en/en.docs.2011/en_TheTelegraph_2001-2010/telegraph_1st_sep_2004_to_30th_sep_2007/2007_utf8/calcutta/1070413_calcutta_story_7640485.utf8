 Youths on bike shoot 

at trader 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A trader was shot at from close range by three motorcycle-borne youths at East Anandanagar in Regent Park on Thursday morning.

 Bidesh Gayen, 28, a supplier of building material, was hit on his right thigh. He was taken to MR Bangur Hospital, from where he was shifted to National Medical College and Hospital.

 The doctors of National Medical College operated on him and removed the bullet. According to the doctors, the trader is out of danger.

 No arrest has been made in connection with the shooting. Preliminary investigation suggests business rivalry could be behind the incident.

 According to police, Bidesh came out of his house around 11 am and was waiting for an autorickshaw. Three young men surrounded Bidesh and tried to prevent him from getting into an autorickshaw.

 A scuffle broke out. In the melee, shots were fired at the trader. As he fell down after being hit, the attackers fled on two motorcycles.

 The local residents and shopkeepers chased the three men, but they sped away. 

 Bidesh was bleeding profusely from the wound on his right thigh. The driver of the autorickshaw fled the scene, said additional superintendent of police (industrial) of South 24-Parganas D.P. Singh. 

 Bideshs father Ananta said he was involved in the plumbing business, but had recently started a business of supplying building materials with two of his friends. I cannot say whether there was a rift between the partners. Recently, Bidesh was receiving ransom calls asking him to pay up or face the consequences. I could never imagine that someone would try to kill my son, said Ananta. 

 Local resident Asish Roy said Bidesh had a cordial relationship with people in the neighbourhood. He might have developed enmity with his business partners, but as far as we know he was a nice man. We want him to recover quickly, he said.

 The additional superintendent said Bideshs family members, friends and business associates have been interrogated. We will also question Bidesh. We have obtained leads and hope to arrest the culprits soon. We are trying to find if a gang was involved in the incident, he added.

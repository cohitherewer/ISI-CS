 Army summons to thana officers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The inquiry committee set up by the army to probe alleged vandalism by its officers and jawans at Park Street police station on the night of December 31, delivered a summons to eight policemen of the thana on Tuesday.

 The summons, sent through the chief metropolitan magistrate of Bankshal court, directs the policemen to appear in court on Wednesday.

 Deputy commissioner (detective department) Gyanwant Singh, who is overseeing the police probe into the incident, acknowledged receipt of the summons: It bears the signatures of Colonel M.C. Baruah, who is heading the army inquiry committee, and the chief metropolitan magistrate. The summons calls for the production of eight policemen in Barrackpore court tomorrow.

 The army had earlier written to deputy commissioner (south division ) Ajay Kumar with the same request. He had replied that the letter should have been addressed to Singh, since he is in charge of the police probe.

 On December 31 night, two army officers were picked on Park Street for allegedly misbehaving with women, and taken to the thana. Police have claimed that the armymen turned violent, leaving the cops with no alternative but to put them in the lock-up.

 According to police, three jeeps of jawans, led by Lt Col Pratap Singh and Major Kavi, raided the police station soon after and freed the arrested army officers after going on the rampage.We want to know what exactly had happened at the police station and how the armymen were involved, said an army officer. Hence, police officers present on the scene have been asked to appear before the committee.

 Singh stated that he had written to the army on January 4, seeking information about the incident. We have not received a response. We are yet to decide whether our men will appear before the army committee, he said.

 It isnt binding on us to send the policemen before the inquiry committee, Singh pointed out.

 The deputy commissioner said the police probe is on its final stages and the report will be ready within a couple of days. We have tracked down a number of civilians who were in the police station at the time of the incident. Their statements tally with our findings. The witnesses have confirmed that the armymen had turned violent and abused the policemen and even a woman from behind the lock-up bars, claimed Singh.

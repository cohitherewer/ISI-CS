The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Takeover for MIG homes

 PTI AND OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 After its foray into IT through a couple of tech parks in Sector V and proposed retail entry in partnership with the RPG Group, the Godrej Group has announced its plans for the residential segment in Calcutta with the acquisition of city-based Happy Highrises.

 Godrej Properties, the realty arm of the $1.3-billion Godrej Group, has completed the acquisition of the Happy Group company for Rs 100 crore, a top Godrej official said on Monday.

 We have acquired Happy Highrises. We intend to develop a middle-income group residential estate on their land, Godrej Properties managing director Milind Korde said. 

 The company has secured around 3.5 million sq ft of developable land through this acquisition.

 We had purchased the 25-acre plot on BT Road in Sodepur from National Textile Corporation and had intended doing MIG housing there. Now, it will be done by Godrej Properties, said Sushil Poddar, the Happy Group chairman.

 This will be our first residential project in Calcutta. We will develop the property on our own, added Korde. Godrej Properties will reserve part of the plot for retail.

 The acquisition was funded through internal accruals and the total investment in the proposed MIG housing project is pegged at Rs 500 crore. Ground-breaking is expected in early-2008.

 The real estate fraternity in town is excited about the development and market watchers feel it could have a strong long-term impact on prices as well.

 If Godrej Properties can deliver a good product in the MIG segment, it could raise the bar in that category, said Abhijit Das of international property consultants JLL Meghraj.

 Das felt after Sodepur, Godrej will eye the high-end residential category. 

 A city-based spokesperson for the Godrej Group confirmed that the company was looking for large land parcels in Calcutta.

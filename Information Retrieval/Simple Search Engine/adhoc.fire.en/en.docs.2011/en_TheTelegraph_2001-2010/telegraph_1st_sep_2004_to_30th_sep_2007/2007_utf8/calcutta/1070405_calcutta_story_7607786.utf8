 Probe rap for theft at SSKM

 SANJAY MANDAL 

 The state human rights commission has directed the health department and police to conduct separate inquiries into the theft of air-conditioning ducts worth Rs 80,000 from the operating theatres of SSKM Hospitals cardio-thoracic department.

 The theft has led to the cancellation of all super-speciality surgeries since March 29.

 Rights panel chairman Shyamal Kumar Sen has asked the director of medical education to submit an interim report by Thursday, mentioning the steps taken to prevent such thefts. Since it is not expected that a postgraduate hospital of the government shall stop all operations for the reasons as alleged, it is expected that all possible steps shall be taken as expeditiously as possible to continue such operations, Sen stated in his letter.

 The health department has been asked to submit the final report within 15 days of receiving the letter. I have not heard about the letter and hence, will not make any comment, said health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra.

 The theft has rendered the state-of-the-art AC machines in the department inoperative. The machines have 100 percent air-freshening and circulating capacity. 

 They are highly expensive and are installed only in a handful of corporate hospitals. Of the state-run hospitals, SSKM was the first to have them installed, said a health department official.

 The machines ensure there is almost no chance of contamination during a surgery, said a cardiac surgeon. During open-heart surgeries, the heart becomes vulnerable to infection while it is taken out of the body. The AC machines lessen the risk to a great extent.

 On an average, six major surgeries take place daily in the three operating theatres of the SSKMs cardio-thoracic department. 

 But over the past week, only a few comparatively minor surgeries took place in the one operating theatre that is functional.

 Jobless in fatal fall

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The 32-year-old unemployed son of a doctor committed suicide on Monday afternoon by jumping off the roof of their Bhowanipore flat. 

 Neighbours and family members rushed Satyendrapal Singh Chopra to SSKM Hospital, where doctors declared him dead. According to police, he was suffering from depression for two years.

 Satyendrapal was the only child of D.S. Chopra, who works in a prominent nursing home in south Calcutta. He had a degree in pharmacology but found it difficult to get a toehold in the professional world, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters). Though he did not leave a suicide note, it appears that unemployment triggered the incident.

 No one in the Chopra family saw Satyendrapal going up to the roof of the six-storey Gokhale Road building around 4pm. They came to know after neighbours and the buildings security guard saw the youth lying on the pavement.

 His parents told the police that he had lunch as usual and went into his room. After some time, Satyendrapal slipped out of the top-floor flat and went upstairs. No one was present on the roof. The durwan of the building heard a sound and rushed out to see him lying in a pool of blood, said an officer of Bhowanipore police station.

 When asked what could have led to the suicide, Satyendrapals father said: He did not want to live.

 The doctors who attended to Satyendrapal found fractures in his skull. His ribs were broken and the lungs were badly damaged. He died the moment he fell, added the officer.

 Another officer said Satyendrapal had completed his B.Pharma four years ago. 

 He was trying for a medical representatives job since then. He became depressed while sitting at home. He was being treated and was under medication, disclosed another officer.

 The police have ruled out the possibility of foul play in the death. We have not found anything to arouse suspicion, said the officer.

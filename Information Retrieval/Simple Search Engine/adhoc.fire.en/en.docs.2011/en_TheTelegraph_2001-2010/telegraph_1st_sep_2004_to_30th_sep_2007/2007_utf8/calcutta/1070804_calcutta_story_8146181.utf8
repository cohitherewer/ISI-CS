 Steal and swallow necklace of gold 

 - Bananas for chain snatcher, lock-up for womans saviour

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Three dozen bananas for snatching a necklace! 

 Constables stood over Sheikh Mohasin and gave him one banana after another. And they wouldnt take no for an answer.

 All thanks to Mohasins unique way of hiding stolen goods. He had swallowed a gold chain as soon as the constables pounced on him.

 An X-ray report confirmed that the chain is in his stomach, said Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 Mohasin had snatched the chain from Kiran Bahari, the middle-aged wife of the owner of a dyeing and cleaning chain, on Brabourne Road around 4.30pm while she was walking to the market.

 Kiran screamed for help as soon as the youth snatched her chain. Her cries drew the attention of two constables patrolling the area in plainclothes, added Kumar.

 They chased Mohasin and pinned him down. But they could not find the chain. 

 The constables suspected that Mohasin had swallowed it but he would not confess. They took him to Burrabazar police station, said an officer.

 After interrogating Mohasin, the officers became sure that he had swallowed the chain. 

 We took him to Medical College and Hospital for an X-ray. The report showed the chain, weighing 15 g, in the stomach, said the officer. Mohasin broke down when we showed him the plate with the chain clearly visible in his stomach.

 The officers, however, couldnt think of an easy way to recover the chain. Following a doctors advice, they bought three dozen bananas. Mohasin refused to eat them. We then told him that the doctors would cut him open to recover the chain. He immediately started eating and finished the bananas in two hours, said Kumar.

 The officers are now waiting for Mohasin to go to the toilet.

 SCALP SOLUTIONS

 What: LOreal Professional Scalp Solutions.

 Where: Headturners at 3 Gurusaday Road.

 Pamper points: LOreal Professionnel has lined up a series of personalised scalp and hair solutions this winter.

 A recent launch, this treatment aims to take care of the scalp by exfoliating and soothing it while also nourishing your hair. There are various treatments you can undertake depending on your hair type and the particular problem plaguing your scalp and hair.

 If your scalp needs purification, take the anti-dandruff treatment that includes cleansing with an anti-dandruff shampoo, treating the scalp with an exfoliating cleanser and then cleared once again with an anti-dandruff gel.

 A balancing treatment can prevent excessive sebum from accumulating on the scalp by deep cleansing, treating with an exfoliating cleanser and following it up with a soothing and moisturising agent.

 If your scalp needs a pamper session after colouring or perming, try out the post-service application of a soothing and moisturising agent. A special treatment has also been designed to address excessive hairloss problems.

 Time frame: The service will take five or six weekly sittings, of an hour each. 

 Pocket pinch: Prices start from Rs 700 per sitting.

 Thumbs up: Cool and relaxing treatment for your scalp and hair. And if you care to sit through all the sessions, your hair is bound to shine with health.

 BODY BASICS

 What: Vitamin Cream Therapy Body Wrap.

 Where: Solace Day Spa at Sunny Park.

 Pamper points: The treatment is designed to soften dry skin, rehydrating and nourishing it with a special range of vitamin cream therapy products from the Blossom Kocchar stable.

 At the outset, the body is wiped clean with a warm towel dipped in essential oils. Next, the vitamin cream is applied all over the body, except the face, with a brush. The body is then wrapped with a plastic film and covered with blankets to keep the body warm. After about 20 minutes, the blankets and plastic film are unwrapped and the body wiped with a warm towel. You can then soothe your senses by taking a leisurely shower.

 FACE FAIR

 What: Kaya Glow.

 Where: Kaya Skin Clinic, 7 Loudon Street.

 Pamper points: The signature service of the skin clinic aims to rejuvenate your skin and give it an instant glow. Even before the facial starts off, dermatologists at the clinic will carry out skin analysis using a Woods Lamp. This is done to find out any previous problems like oily spots, scars, hyper-pigmented skin, dark patches or circles. The facial begins with microdermabrasion, which helps remove dead cells on the facial skin. Next, a rehydrating face mask comprising Dead Sea minerals and seaweed is applied and kept on for 15-20 minutes. A sunscreen and moisturiser are applied at the end.

 Time frame: The whole facial will take about an hour and 20 minutes. For best results, you require six to eight sessions at an interval of 10-12 days.

 Pamper points: Designed to increase the blood circulation, the important pressure points of the body are massaged for about 45 minutes. While soft music plays in the background to soothe your frayed nerves, a hydrating pack containing aloe vera, Dead Sea minerals and marine spa products is applied on the body. For better penetration of the product, the body is wrapped with a warm towel having essential and aromatic oils. After 15 minutes, the body is wiped down. If you have some time on your hands, you can also go in for an exfoliation service before the hydrating pack is applied all over.

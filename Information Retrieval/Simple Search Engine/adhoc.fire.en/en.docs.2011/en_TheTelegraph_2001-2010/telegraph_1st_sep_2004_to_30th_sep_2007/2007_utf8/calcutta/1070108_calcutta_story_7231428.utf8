 Managers are better off managing big business houses, they should not think about joining politics.

 West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee gave this suggestion to B-school boys and girls on Sunday during an interactive session with students at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta.

 I think most of you will be interested in big business houses. So, my suggestion is, complete your graduation and then run the business houses properly, said Bhattacharjee, replying to a question on why political parties are failing to woo bright students.

 We joined politics at a different time and the conditions were different, said the chief minister, during his maiden visit to the Joka B-school to deliver the keynote address at Intaglio, one of the biggest B-school meets in the country.

 A variety of questions ranging from the trade-off between politics and good economics to the debate between farmland and factories was hurled at Bhattacharjee during the 25-minute Q amp;A session.

 The chief minister not even once came across as a communist leader He was speaking our language, said Asim, a second-year student at IIM Calcutta.

 Bhattacharjees thoughts globalisation is a must, we have to change with the times were music to the ears of the management students. 

 And his way of presentation case study approach in B-school parlance by drawing examples from the US, China, Vietnam and Latin America made him an instant hit with the audience, comprising students from local and global B-schools.

 Look at China, agriculture contributes just six per cent to the countrys gross domestic product, while industrys contribution is around 71 per cent. In West Bengal, industrys contribution is just 24 per cent, said Bhattacharjee, presenting his argument on farm-versus-factory debate.

 Gross domestic product is the value of goods and services produced in a country in a year. 

 The chief minister stressed that his government was committed to increasing the share of industry in Bengals state domestic product, which is growing at a rate faster than the national average. 

 Bhattacharjee, however, admitted that he was facing problems while pursuing his agenda. 

 I am facing a lot of problems But I am an optimist, he said, referring to the opposition to Tata Motors peoples car project in Singur and the special economic zone (SEZ) project of the Salim Group in Nandigram. 

 While he expressed disappointment at the resistance by the opposition parties, he pledged that the West Bengal government would carry on with its programmes. 

 What we liked about him was his clarity of thoughts and conviction, said Tanu, a first-year student at IIM Calcutta. 

 Supriya, another first-year student, chorused her views and added that she had faith on Bhattacharjees claims that the efforts to industrialise Bengal have started paying off results. 

 The big round of applause at the auditorium when the chief minister rolled out the latest list of investment proposals like Jindals steel plant in Shalboni, Videocons proposed special economic zone in Siliguri proved that the majority in the audience had faith in Bhattacharjees model of development.

 His candour about his belief that capitalism is not the last chapter of human history and Marxs theory of surplus value also won many a hearts at the Joka campus.

 The chief minister can have his views, but he is delivering and also willing to change with the changing times Thats what matters, signed off Asim.

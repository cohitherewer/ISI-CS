 A suspicion that the man she had secretly married was having an affair with another woman drove 26-year-old Jharna Biswas to end her life on Thursday night.

 The social marriage of Jharna and Sanjib Adhikari, 30, was scheduled for July 6. The two had sealed their union, keeping their families in the dark, in a marriage bureau on January 1, 2004. The schoolteacher hanged herself at her Anath Deb Lane home in Tallah, in north Calcutta.

 She suspected me of having an affair with one of my students. I denied it, but she refused to believe me. Last night, we had an argument over the issue, but I never thought she would take such a drastic step, said Sanjib, a physiotherapist, who lives next door to Jharnas family.

 Jharna left behind a suicide note, saying she was suffering because of her suspicious nature and that nobody was responsible for her death. Her family, however, lodged a complaint against Sanjib, prompting police to detain him for interrogation.

 Everything was ready for the wedding. On Wednesday morning, Jharna even went to my parents house in Arambagh to invite them, said mother Madhabi, in tears.

 Last night, didi was confined to her room and did not eat dinner, said Jharnas cousin Bibhash. He broke open her bedroom door on Friday morning after repeated knocks went unanswered, and found her hanging from the ceiling with a dupatta. 

 She had called Sanjib from her cellphone at midnight, said Bibhash.

 Its a case of suicide, said deputy commissioner (north) Damayanti Sen.

 Across generations: Howrah

 bridge cuts a majestic figure 

 It was shocking to read the report Abuse battle begins at home, on April 12. Her own parents are inflicting inhuman physical torture on Suparna Sarkar to force her into earning by performing to raunchy Hindi film songs on stage for their livelihood. It is the norm in Bengali families to impart some kind of musical training to children, especially daughters. Suparna was also sent for kathak classes. Who could imagine that in her case, the parents were guided by purely a business motive? 

 The situation took such a turn that the poor girl was compelled to lodge a police complaint against her own parents. It was a tremendously courageous decision for a teenaged girl. 

 The childrens welfare department must work to put an end to the miseries of the Suparnas of our state. 

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur. 

 Apropos the report Health scan on Howrah bridge, April 19, it is good to learn that the port trust will do a thorough check-up of the 64-year-old bridge. Given its importance and the fact that it is a part of the heritage of both Calcutta and Howrah, the move is pragmatic and praiseworthy. I had read that about 100 labourers were killed during the construction of the bridge. I request the authorities to build a memorial to the labourers on it. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 It is disheartening to learn that the Howrah

 bridge, one of the citys most precious possessions, is under the weather.

 The impact of the barge that hit the underbelly of the bridge in June 2005

 also could not have helped matters. What is alarming is the opinion of

 experts that unless the bridge is overhauled and its load halved, it will

 not remain stable in 15 years. Hopefully, the Calcutta Port Trust will

 learn from past mistakes. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road.

 Apropos the report Tall claims in foul-air defence, April 11, it is obvious that the government lied about the measures taken to curb auto emission in the status report submitted in the high court. The political leaders are using every trick in the book to avoid taking affirmative action against pollution. Fatal fumes have become a global headache, but the state government seems bent on paving a path to the grave. 

 Govinda Bakshi, 

 Budge Budge. 

 To check air pollution, the government should

 take strong penal action against errant vehicles. The foul air they discharge particularly the CSTC and private buses damages

 lungs and eyes of pedestrians and passengers of cars walking or plying

 by them. 

 Air is not polluted only by vehicles. Coloured kerosene oil also emits smoke. The Corporation sweepers should also be added to the list. They run outlets adjoining the vats, detrimental to the hygiene of the surroundings, to resell select articles from the waste. 

 Sarit Datta, 

 Kidderpore. 

 I was not surprised by the article Suicide bid after dupe by promoter on April 17, as promoters and so-called real estate managers often cheat innocent customers. Confident of their rapport with political leaders, municipality councillors as well as goons, they fearlessly violate contracts, allotting a flat to a new customer ignoring another who has paid the advance amount. Usually, police favour the promoter as he can instantly buy support. Houseowners who hand over their old buildings to the promoter for construction of an apartment block also often face harsh treatment. Legal redress is a far cry as court cases linger across generations. 

 Abdul Fateh Kamruddin,

 Chandbati, Hooghly. 

 Apropos the report Man in misery lies in vat, April 14, it is unfortunate that a tramp with a wounded foot has been lying in a garbage vat on BT Road for two months. Why is this happening when there are so many health centres in the city? It is inhuman on the part of the NGOs to neglect a wounded man with a rotting toe. 

 The callous attitude of the police is most contemptible. If he is still surviving, it is because of the residents who offer him food and medicine. The local hospital should admit him immediately. Unless he dies before they wake up. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder,

 Behala. 

It is true that mathematics inspires terror among most students. So the group-learning session on the subject organised by teachers from several city schools will be helpful (Math, learn and have fun, April 18). 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

 Behala.

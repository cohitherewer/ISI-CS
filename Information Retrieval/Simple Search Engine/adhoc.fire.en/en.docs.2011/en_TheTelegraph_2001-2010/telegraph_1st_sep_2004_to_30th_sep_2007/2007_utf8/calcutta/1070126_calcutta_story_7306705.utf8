 The real amp; unreal

 A photograph by Shahid Datawala on display at the Seagull Media Resource Centre 

 Cinemas once used to be palaces fit for Hollywood stars. Those who remember the art deco splendour of our very own Metro would vouch for this. Then in the late 1960s, Hollywood films were only read about in magazines. Rarely seen. The Bollywood empire stamped out all else.

 Then the screens became smaller. They found their way into our homes. The idiot box so entranced the nation that people forgot the cinemas. The 1990s gave rise to a generation hardly exposed to the magic of cinema. The palaces turned into pissoirs.Neglected, these white elephants soon turned into haunts for quickies. Seats were disembowelled, walls and floors became spitoons and the halls were stripped of all their tinsel glamour.

 This is the world of scum and sleaze that Shahid Datawala so vividly captures in his wonderful silver gelatin prints some of stupendous dimensions now being exhibited at Seagull Media Resource Centre.

 Datawalas cinemas are huge, deserted spaces, spooky corridors that lead to loos, staircases of stained marble with a 1950s Bollywood heroine smiling above the landing, carpeted staircases with mirrors, frozen fountain motifs in art deco halls and large foyers with chequerboard floors. Datawala records it all in his stark black-and-white frames.

 He has a feel for architecture and this quality comes across in his photographs with its succession of arches like mirror images. Sometimes, an architectural element extends into an unreal world where a pigeon perches on a pilaster, with a beam from an unseen source focused on it. The light also catches the spitoon underneath. About three-quarters of the vertical frame is dark, the grey walls are speckled with dirt. The pilaster and ceiling are delicately patterned.

 This is not just still life. Datawala has a keen eye for the seamier side of life around cinemas, and he records this with a sense of humour in true Cartier Bresson spirit. A poster girl in bedclothes lies sprawled behind two friends. A man steals a glance at a blonde as she passes by. A middle-aged man stares at (seemingly) the armpits of a buxom beauty in a huge hand-painted hoarding. A young woman stands under a billboard that reads: 5 Girls murdered 7 girls missing Whos next.

 The real and the unreal flow into each other. The common man cocks a snook at the biggest of superstars. Has the pole dancer stepped out of the poster? Is the cardboard cutout beauty more real than the man at the box office.

 There are some spectacular prints of smoke-filled halls taken from the balcony. These are framed by archways with fans whirring by them dream factories of the common man. 

 Datawala has the vision of a poet and he conjures up a very lurid world indeed.

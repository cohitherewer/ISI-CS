 Help in neglect suit

 - Doctors for UMS become popular

 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE

 Raja Mallick died of gastro-enteritis at 16 after doctors failed to treat him properly. His father, Anwar Ali Mallick, has been running from pillar to post to get justice. A doctors forum is his last hope.

 Nine-year-old Anamitra Modok, an only child, died in 2005 during a surgery to correct a squint at Shankara Nethralaya. His parents have approached a doctors forum in the city for help in bringing the surgeons to book.

 Victims of medical negligence are increasingly turning to doctors forums for justice. 

 Earlier, people used to file cases against doctors without knowing whether the charge of negligence in treatment could be proved. The members of doctors forums explain the medical aspects of the case to the victims and tell them about their chance in court, said physician Swapan Jana, secretary of Society for Social Pharmacology, the oldest doctors forum in the city. 

 The forums offer advice and legal aid, in addition to filing reports and spreading awareness. Numerous people approach us with cases. We dont take on more than a case a week because we are unable to spare time, added Jana.

 Not many people know about us but we still get eight to 10 cases a month, said physician Debopriyo Mallick of the Jana Swasthya Swadhikar Mancha, which started in 2004.

 The focus of the forums vary. We focus on the social aspect of the cases, while People for Better Treatment deals with the legal aspect. We make posters, distribute leaflets and mail letters to spread awareness about medical negligence, said Mallick.

 For Society for Social Pharmacology, the primary aim is to introduce medicine in the school curriculum. We want school students to learn the basics of medicine so that doctors cannot ignore them, saying that they do not know anything about the subject, said Jana.

 People have become suspicious, now that they have to buy treatment. Hospitals are known to keep clinically dead patients on life support for several days to earn money. Doctors are also known to prescribe unnecessarily expensive medicines to get a cut from the pharmaceutical companies, added the doctor.

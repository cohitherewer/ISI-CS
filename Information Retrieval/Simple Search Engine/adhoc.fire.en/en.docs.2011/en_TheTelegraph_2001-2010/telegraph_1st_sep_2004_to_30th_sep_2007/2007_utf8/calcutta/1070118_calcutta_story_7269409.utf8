Reaching out to the elderly amp; lonely

 Retired professor Mridul Kanti Bose, 77, and his 68-year old wife Romola, a former government employee, were lonely in their apartment off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. Their children are away and they had no one to look after them, until Swajan entered their lives.

 Swajan, a non-government organisation in Mukundapur, off the Bypass, has taken up the job of looking after the aged and the ailing across the city and its fringes. 

 There are many lonely aged couples, just like the Boses. They feel insecure as their children and relatives are not around. Our aim is to help these couples in meeting their needs and give them company, explained Subrata Roy, chairman of Swajan.

 I regularly meet these elderly couples. They are very lonely, there is no one to listen to them. This prompted us to form the NGO in 2001, explained Roy. 

 Swajan has 10 volunteers, who look after 10 couples. 

 Every week, they wait for us eagerly. I visit them twice or thrice a week. I try to help them in different ways, like reading the newspaper or taking them to doctors or buying medicines, said Debjani, who looks after the Bose couple.

 The NGO conducts a special training for volunteers before putting them on the job. The services are offered free. But due to lack of funds, the organisation is struggling to reach out more couples. 

 We just accept the bus or train fare. But we are paying a major amount from our pockets. We are thinking of taking help from some other agency, admitted chairman Roy.

 But lack of funds has not deterred the volunteers. The aged need help at every step. So, we have our volunteers working round the clock. Anyone can contact us on our office numbers 24260794 or 9830271260, added Roy.

 Besides, plans are afoot to build an old age home. We want to engage the elderly in some job to keep them busy. For example, they can teach underprivileged children or help the self-help groups. We are striving hard to fulfil our dream, signed off Roy.

 Jubilee club eyes upgrade

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Lions Club of Calcutta will celebrate its golden jubilee this month. A cultural programme will be organised at Vidya Mandir on May 27 to mark the occasion. 

 Postmaster-general (West Bengal) Manojit Kumar will release a special cover at the event.

 The 201-member club the oldest of all Lion clubs in eastern India, Myanmar, Nepal and Bangladesh was set up on March 13, 1957.

 In our 50th year, we will focus on expanding and upgrading our three eye hospitals two in the city and one in Hooghly, said Kedar Nath Gupta, chairman, golden jubilee committee of the club.

 The club plans to install a device at Calcutta Lions Netra Niketan, near Golf Green, to treat eye patients suffering from diabetes. The equipment will cost Rs 50-60 lakh. The funds will come from the Lions Club International, said Gupta.

 The club has also initiated the process of getting Netra Niketan certified by the ISO. We hope the certification will come in the next four months, said Gupta.

 Club president Kamal Nayan Jain said 9,000 operations are performed every year at Netra Niketan, Bimal Poddar Eye Hospital and Ramkrishnabati Hospital.

 The hospitals have the capacity to operate on 14,000 patients a year. Free operations at our hospitals far outnumber the paid ones. The money we get from the paid operations are spent on the treatment for the poor, said Jain.

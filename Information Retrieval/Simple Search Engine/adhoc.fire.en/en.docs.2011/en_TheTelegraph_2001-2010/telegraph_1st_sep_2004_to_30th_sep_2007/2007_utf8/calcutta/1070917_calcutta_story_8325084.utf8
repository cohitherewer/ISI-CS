 Arrest after torture tag

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A medical officer of SSKM Hospital was arrested on Sunday on charges of torturing his wife for dowry. 

 In the complaint filed in the additional chief judicial magistrates court, Priti Banerjee, 35, alleged that her husband, Subir Muhuri, 42, tortured her for dowry. 

 Priti left her husbands home six months ago and went back to her parents, said Ashoke Biswas, the additional superintendent of police, Bidhannagar. After speaking to the estranged couple and some neighbours, we arrested Muhuri at his Lake Town home, he added. Muhuri will be produced in court on Monday.

 Subir and Priti got married two years ago. This was Subirs second marriage. The earlier one, too, broke up because of domestic violence, said an officer of Lake Town police station. 

 Soon after marrying Priti, he started demanding money. When she did not yield, he started torturing her. He persisted with the mental torture even after she left home. She finally lodged a complaint in July, said the officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 New Year with family, in hospital 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It was supposed to be a quiet New Years Day with the family cakes, sweets and fun at home in Haldia. But thanks to the army action at Park Street police station, sub-inspector Bidhan Chandra Khatua of the traffic department spent the day in hospital. 

 With four stitches on his forehead and bruises on his chest and back, Khatua struggled to smile on Monday afternoon as his wife and son turned up at the Calcutta Police Hospital to wish him a Happy New Year and speedy recovery.

 Khatua was one of the policemen beaten up by jawans from the Madras Regiment at Park Street police station as armymen tried to free two officers in the lock-up.

 It was around 12.45 am and I was completing the formalities of a case related to drunken driving. I was sitting in the duty officers room when the armymen barged in. Some of them were in uniform. Two of them hit me on the face and my glasses went flying. Another hit me on the forehead with the butt of his rifle. With blood trickling down, I couldnt see anything, recalled Khatua.

 My colleagues rushed me to a police jeep, but we couldnt move since the vehicle was surrounded by the armymen. Two of my colleagues finally took me to SSKM Hospital in a taxi, said Khatua. He added that he had never had such an experience in his 22 years of service.

 The officer-in-charge of the police station called to give me the news. I decided to head for Calcutta. Even last night, I had recalled the Bapi Sen incident, said wife Sheela.

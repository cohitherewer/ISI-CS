 A 32-year-old homemaker committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling of her bedroom early on Sunday.

 Preeti Verma left a suicide note naming husband Sanjay Verma, 35, and mother-in-law Savitri Verma.

 But neighbours in the Chiriamore area, near Kaikhali, off VIP Road, said Sanjays alleged homosexual relationship with a cousin had driven Preeti to despair and death.

 The name of Manoj Verma, or Munna, cropped up in every conversation on Monday as police probed the unnatural death case.

 Some neighbours, on condition of anonymity, revealed how Preeti had been suffering because of her husbands relationship with Manoj. 

 Sanjay and Manoj are also business partners as gold merchants.

 Sanjay and Preeti were married for five years but he remained very close to his cousin Munna. That relationship must have driven her to suicide, said a confidante of Preeti.

 Even when the two went on their honeymoon, Munna was with them. We want police to look into this relationship as the cause of Preetis death. She did not make it public and suffered in silence, as she did not want to malign her husband, she added.

 Sanjay was not at home when Preeti committed suicide early on Sunday.

 Preetis brother Amit Kumar, from Ranchi, lodged a complaint, holding five members of the Verma family husband Sanjay, mother-in-law Savitri, brother-in-law Manoj and his wife Mani, and another brother-in-law Ajay responsible for her death.

 The complaint did not hint at any homosexual relations between the two cousins.

 On the basis of the complaint lodged by Preetis brother, we arrested Sanjay Verma and his cousin Manoj. They have been remanded in judicial custody for seven days, said the superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas), Praveen Kumar.

 The three others named in the FIR were absconding till late on Monday.

 Har Verma, Preetis father-in-law, who has been described by their neighbours as a nice person, unlike the other family members, dismissed talk about his sons closeness with cousin Munna.

 I think the issue of the two having a relationship is baseless. My son is running his business well and some people are trying to malign him, alleged the 72-year-old, at his G-504 apartment in the Green Valley estate near Kaikhali.

 Har, a former employee of a private firm, added: Manoj and Sanjay are business partners and this might have brought them closer. I dont see anything wrong if two brothers live and work together to nurture their business.

 Other members of the Verma family tried to deflect the focus from Sanjays alleged relationship.

 Preeti was terribly upset after she suffered three miscarriages. She was undergoing treatment recently to ensure a safe pregnancy. She had gone into a deep depression because of the miscarriages, as most of her peers were mothers, while she was childless, said a relative of Sanjay.

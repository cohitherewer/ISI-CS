 Steamy affair

 What: Launch of Godrej Microsteam oven.

 When: January 11.

 Where: The Park.

 Whats cooking: The Godrej Microsteam introduces the concept of the steam microwave. The appliance offers three cooking modes steam, grill and microwave.

 The new microsteam system injects superheated steam into the entire oven chamber, to prepare steamed dishes faster while retaining the original flavour and nutrient value of the ingredients. Not only does the uniform and gentle application of heat make the food soft and succulent, steaming also helps in cutting down on excess fat. The steaming works to extract fat from the food and deposits it as water or fluids in a tray. 

 The launch was followed by a demonstration. My life revolves around the microwave because it is so much faster. But the advantage of Godrej Microsteam is that it makes the food softer and moister. Also, I am quite conscious about my health and have always preferred light food, and it makes a difference that the microsteam burns the fat in the meat, said actress June at the launch.

 Pocket pinch: Godrej Microsteam is pegged at an introductory price of Rs 14,990.

 Voiceover: Steaming has traditionally been known to be the best form of cooking. The Microsteam helps in steaming the food just right, to make it tasty, succulent, nutritious and low-calorie. We are targeting the young and the health conscious, said Himangshu Jain, product group head.

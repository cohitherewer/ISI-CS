 Chronicling the march of months

 - Panwars works better off without mishmash of words

 SOUMITRA DAS

 A work by Pampa Panwar

 The march of the months and the corresponding change of the seasons are filtered through the splintered sensibility of Pampa Panwar and bodied forth in her paintings, now being exhibited at Gandhara Art Gallery. She uses acrylic on canvas of various geometric shapes.

 The artist lives in Santiniketan and this anyone can make out from the postmarks on her canvases, which record the changes (among various other things) she notices in the surroundings of the university campus. 

 Santiniketan is still regarded as Arcadia by the same people of the city who have furthered its destruction. But Panwar is no green activist and these paintings are not meant to be substitutes for pamphlets.

 The paintings are like pages from calendars, with the month mentioned on each work. Each canvas is divided into various sections and similar images are replicated innumerable times in each. So, the backdrop looks like brightly printed textile. What complicates matters are images superimposed on this field, images which often serve as the marker of the season she has in mind.

 For example, spring ushers in a host of butterflies and bees and giant dragonflies, while the monsoon brings in an umbrella. Colours change accordingly. Panwar does not leave any doubt in the mind of the viewer that these paintings are all about her own experiences and memories. The July canvas actually carries her portrait. 

 Certain sections of her paintings are filled with squiggles, dots and dashes in various colours, fusing a multiplicity of experiences and memories. Silhouettes of football players and horse riders and various other images look like Josephs coat of many colours.

 This mode of painting, however, holds no surprise for several artists have been doing the same for some time. Panwar creates her works with a certain degree of skill and feel for her medium. So, Panwars paintings stand on their own without being propped up by the accompanying mishmash of words.

 An institute for higher study and research in pure mathematics, theoretical and mathematical physics, and theoretical computer science will soon be set up in Belur.

 School of Mathematical Sciences, to be set up by Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda University, will make its debut in 2008 with an integrated M.Sc-Ph.D course in pure mathematics. The following year, a similar course will be launched in physics. Integrated courses from B.Sc through Ph.D in all three subjects will be introduced later.

 Researchers from reputed institutes across the world, including Nobel laureates, will be invited to deliver lectures at the school.

 The plan for the school was announced by Moolchand Sharma, the UGC vice-chairman, at a programme to mark the second anniversary of the university at RK Mission Residential College, Narendrapur, on Wednesday.

 The teaching-learning system at the school will be different from other universities. Our main focus will be on grooming students to develop an inclination in research, said Swami Atmapriyananda, the vice-chancellor.

 Once a student completes graduation, it becomes difficult to motivate him/her to pursue research. So, the remedy is to set up institutes, like our proposed school, which can provide the grooming from the undergraduate level, he added.

 The university has sought Rs 59.26 crore from the UGC to set up the school and another institute, School of Indian Heritage. The UGC is examining the proposal. We will provide all necessary help to the university to set up the two schools, said Sharma.

 The university has bought a 7.5-acre plot in Belur for Rs 14 crore to set up the institutes.

 Swami Smaranananda, the vice-president of Ramakrishna Math and Mission, and Swami Prabhananda, the general secretary of the order and chancellor of the university, were present at the programme. Also present was Swami Asaktananda, the secretary of RK Mission Residential College, Narendrapur.

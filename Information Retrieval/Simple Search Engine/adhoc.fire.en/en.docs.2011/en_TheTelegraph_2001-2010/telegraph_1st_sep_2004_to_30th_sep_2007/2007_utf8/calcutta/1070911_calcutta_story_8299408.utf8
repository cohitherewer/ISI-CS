 Murder for a ring 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The Park Side Road house

 The prime accused in the murder of Lake market lawyer Shyama Prasad Roy reportedly told police that he had committed the crime lured by a diamond ring of the victim that was worth a crore.

 Sanjay Banerjee claimed that his partners in crime were Arindam Ghosh, son of a retired sub-inspector, and Amlan Dutta.

 Roy, 54, was found murdered in his Park Side Road flat on August 16. The lawyer, who was married with a daughter, had been living alone for the past eight years.

 Three men, including Ghosh and Dutta, were arrested earlier, but Banerjee was eluding the cops. He was arrested in the New Market area on Saturday. 

 An officer of Tollygunge police station said Banerjee and Dutta would be grilled together to verify claims that the ring had been sold to a trader in Surat. Roy was murdered on August 14 and Banerjee and Datta had hatched the plot a day before, the officer added.

 The sleuths have come to know that Banerjee, in his 40s, was staying with his second wife, away from his parents. He used to spend most of his money on women, wine and horse racing, said an investigating officer. 

 He had duped several persons before meeting Roy at the race course a few years back. Ever since he learnt that the lawyer had an expensive ring, he had been trying to win Roys confidence, the sleuth added.

 Roy had told Banerjee that he wanted to sell the ring. But when Banerjee offered to buy it, the lawyer shooed him away. The relation between the two soured after that.

 The police claim to have found out that on the day of the murder, Ghosh called Roy introducing himself as an agent of a rich man who wanted to buy the ring. 

 Banerjee, Dutta and six others turned up at the Lake market address in two cars. One of the drivers and a hired killer entered the flat posing as prospective buyers. As soon as Roy showed them the ring, they strangled him to death, said an officer.

 Dutta told the police that Banerjee had asked him to provide a few youths for the murder.

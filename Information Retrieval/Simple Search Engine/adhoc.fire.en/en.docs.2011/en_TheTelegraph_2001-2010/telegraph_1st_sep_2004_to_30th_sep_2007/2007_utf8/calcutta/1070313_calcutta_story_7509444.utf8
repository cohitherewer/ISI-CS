 Bridging the gap

 How many of us have grown up knowing teachers to be tyrants? For teachers, the divide with students is often more pronounced by the interference of parents who profess to know their children better. On February 24, ITC Classmate, hosted a discussion on the subject titled Principal, Parents and Children: Building a Relationship of Mutuality. 

 Chaired by Shashank Vira, CEO of Global Education Management Limited, the discussion tried to bring parents and teachers on a common platform towards improving the condition of students, the central stakeholders in the educational system. Around 150 principals from city schools joined in the session. 

 While Sandhya Srinivasan of the International Deaf Childrens Society, India, felt parents were responsible for inculcating basic principles in a child, S. Chakraborty, principal of La Martiniere School for Boys, agreed that the present system of education restrained students from exploring their creativity. Also present on the panel were K. Khullar, principal of Akshar School, and L.N. Balaji, head of Strategic Planning, ITC.

 The panelists agreed on the need for greater student involvement, in the choice of what they are taught, as well as the method of imparting education. 

 The occasion also saw Biboswan Bose of Future Foundation School and Rakhi Chakraborty of Bridge International School, the regional winners of the Classmate Young Authors Contest 2006, being felicitated. Rakhi, whose story Planetary Woes got her the fourth position at the national level, said: It was great to interact with people from 15 other states. But the best part was meeting author Ruskin Bond.

 THE DIARY

 Cocoon

 Living 

 In my cocoon, 

 Dreading contact with The intruding sun. 

 Disliking the cold shimmer of Expanding moon, 

 I sulk in my own sorrow. 

 Lost in myself 

 Like Narcissus. 

 I love to be in an absent pain, 

 To cry meaninglessly,

 Shedding cold tears. 

 Till 

 A drop of hot blood touches me.

 It belongs to a dead farmer 

 Self-slain, a burdened man... 

 And I ask myself- 

 Can I stay in my willed cocoon?

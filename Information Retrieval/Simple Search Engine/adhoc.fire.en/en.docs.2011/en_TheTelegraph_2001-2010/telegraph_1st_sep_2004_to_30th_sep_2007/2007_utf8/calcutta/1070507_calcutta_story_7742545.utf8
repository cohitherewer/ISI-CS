 Thalassaemia scan

 - Count has risen in past five years

 A STAFF REPORTER

 More than six per cent of Calcuttas population are thalassaemia carriers, a recent study has revealed. 

 The study, conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the state health department, has found that in the past five years, there has been a sharp increase in the number of thalassaemia patients. 

 At Nil Ratan Sirkar Medical College and Hospital, more than half of the 6,000 persons screened were found to be thalassaemia carriers or have manifested symptoms of the disease (see box).

 In the first phase, the study was conducted on pregnant women at ante-natal clinics and college students, one of the doctors involved in the project said.

 The second phase of the study will be conducted to find out the probability of a baby being affected by thalassaemia if its parents are carriers. 

 Sharmila Chandra, a city-based haematologist, said more than 1,000 thalassaemic children are treated at various private clinics and state-run hospitals every year. 

 With the spurt in the number, the awareness level has also gone up, she said.

 Chandra added that treatment has become a problem for many. Depending on the age and condition of a patient, the monthly expense for treatment ranges from Rs 3,000 to Rs 10,000. Everyone cannot afford the money.

 The study, first conducted by the ICMR in 2000, is the most comprehensive one on thalassaemia, covering major cities like Calcutta, Dibrugarh, Ludhiana, Bangalore and Mumbai. 

 Since 2005, the study is being supported by the state health department. 

 In Calcutta, the haematology departments of NRS Medical College and Hospital and Medical College and Hospital are the two nodal agencies for the study.

 Club of clubs, change of scene

It has no formal home, no book of rules, no seed capital, no source of funding, revenue streams or staff. But its already three decades old and usually records an attendance of roughly two cricket teams and some reserves!

 The Association of Clubs in Calcutta (founded 1976) is a unique body of 10 leading city clubs. Its quite something to see the presidents of 10 major clubs in Calcutta together at one place. Its even more difficult to find a day on which all 10 would be able to be together! smiles Ashwani Kapur, convener of the association. 

 If there is one forum that will control everything, then everything stays on track, says A.K. Chatterjee, president, Saturday Club, where the association met on Thursday. The member clubs are Bengal Club, Bengal Rowing Club, Calcutta Club, Calcutta Cricket and Football Club, Calcutta Racket Club, Calcutta Swimming Club, Royal Calcutta Golf Club, Royal Calcutta Turf Club, Saturday Club and Tollygunge Club. I feel privileged to be the only woman in the association, said Renu Roy, vice-president, Saturday Club.

 On Thursday, the association discussed matters that sought common solutions particularly of taxes and levies. 

 New theatre 

 Not so long ago, it was usual to have a club drama begin hours late. Things seem to have changed. At the Sampreeti Theatre Utsav, held from February 14 to 17, curtains went up and down on cue before a packed hall through the four days of the inter-club festival.

 Hosted by Lake Club at Uttam Mancha, the 5th Inter-Club Bengali Drama Festival was a part of the Sampreeti movement that began in 2002. Started by Outram Club, the festival has over the years drawn participation from Calcutta Club, Calcutta Rowing Club, Dalhousie Institute, Dakshin Kalikata Sansad, International Club, Indian Life Saving Society and Lake Club.

 We brought down a four-hour play to one hour, said Saibal Banerjee, who directed Noti Binodini for Outram Club and achieved the impossible by getting call shows.

 It is probably the presence of group-theatre enthusiasts and professional actors that has helped push club-theatre to new heights. 

 Ramaditya Ray, a doctor, has worked with Utpal Dutta and Jochhon Dastidar and directed Manoj Mitras Parobash at Banga Sammelan in Detroit where Sabyasachi Chakraborty was part of the cast. He has directed plays for the Indian Life Saving Society for the last five years.

 Asit Mukherjee of Dakshin Kalikata Sansad directed Mohit Chattopadhayays Dishum Dushum for Sampreeti 2007.

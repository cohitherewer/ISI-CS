 Some 80 years ago, it was a film studio that churned out black-and-white celluloid classics. On Wednesday, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee unveiled the revamped Radha Films Studio, rechristened Chalachitra Shatabarsho Bhavan.

 Built by the information and cultural affairs department at a cost of Rs 3.21 crore, the three-storeyed Tollygunge address now houses an archive that captures the long journey of Bengali cinema. 

 The archive is a gift to film buffs. We plan to further upgrade the centre and collaborate with foreign organisations to help restore prints of old films, said Bhattacharjee. 

 Work on the Bhavan started in 1998, but got delayed due to financial and technical problems, said Dilip Kumar Chakrabarty, chief secretary, information and cultural affairs.

 The Bhavan will preserve and store prints and negatives of significant Bengali films in three vaults of varying temperature. 

 An archive on Satyajit Ray memorabilia that has been shifted out of Nandan finds pride of place in studio, alongside an exhibition of film stills and a library.

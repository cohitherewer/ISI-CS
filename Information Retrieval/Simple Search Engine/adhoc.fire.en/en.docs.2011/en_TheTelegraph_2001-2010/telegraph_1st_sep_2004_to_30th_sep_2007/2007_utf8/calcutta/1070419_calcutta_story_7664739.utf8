 Ramadorai: On a high

 Indias biggest information technology (IT) company has clocked the highest growth in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal.

 S. Ramadorai, chairman and managing director, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), who called on Bhattacharjee on Wednesday, announced that business volume of the IT bellwether has grown by around 45 per cent from its Calcutta centre. 

 The performance is five points more than the companys nationwide show 40 per cent growth.

 After sharing the magic numbers, Ramadorai rolled out the companys Calcutta plans: At present, we employ around 7,000 people in the Calcutta centre. In the next two years, we plan to cross 10,000 and reach 20,000 in three years.

 During his meeting with the chief minister, Ramadorai accompanied by senior TCS officials briefed him about the companys plans for Bengal. TCS has already bought a 40-acre plot at the rate of Rs 1.5 crore per acre in Rajarhat to set up an IT hub. The company has plans to kick off construction work this year. The TCS chief also called on IT minister Debesh Das on Wednesday. 

 Besides expanding its software business, TCS is also planning to start business process outsourcing (BPO) operations from the city. The plan for now is to use leased premises for the BPO unit.

 We are recruiting engineers as well as science graduates for our operations in the city. We are closely associated with the Webel finishing school and are working with Webel to develop a six-month course to cater to the needs of the BPO industry, said a TCS official.

 German construction experts have offered a handholding platform to city developers for upgrading skills of real estate site workers to help shrink timelines and reduce costs.

 Skilled workers, cutting-edge equipment and quality material combine to deliver good performance in real estate construction. We are here to provide inputs and share best practices to help construction site workers improve their efficiency, Uwe Drewes of UDConsult, a German construction consulting firm, told Metro.

 Uwe, who has overseen the recent renewal of runways at Frankfurt airport, is in town along with Dirk Drewes of Dirk Drewes Consult, dealing in project management, project controlling and international contracting, to conduct workshops and also advise on material and tools.

 Credai Bengal, the state umbrella body of developers, is keen to grab the German upgrade opportunity with both hands. Theres a crying need for skilled manpower in the construction industry and we are exploring possible instruments of collaboration with the German consultants, said Subhromoni De, secretary-general, Credai Bengal.

 City-based real estate firm, the PS Group, is signing an MoU with the German firms for in-house training of its construction workers, foremen and supervisors. Itll be a continuous process of inputs sharing and we will send some of our supervisors to Germany, declared Pradip Chopra, of the PS Group.

 Chopra feels by tightening up time schedules through upgrade of efficiency of the on-site workforce, at least a five per cent cost cut can be achieved. Most of the cost escalation here happens due to delays, he pointed out.

 Officials of Credai Bengal, which is working on training people at two levels, managerial and site workers, have discussed the possibility of structured workshops and training programmes with the Germans.

 Uwe, also a guest lecturer at the University of Applied Sciences in Leipzig, said many German students would like to come and intern at Calcutta construction sites.

 Its the workers who must earn the pay-packet of the CEO. While in Western Europe, we are forced to reduce manpower on site, its a very human-intensive scenario here, all the more reason for better knowledge on techniques and technology, said Dirk.

The city received the years first shower on Sunday evening following development of two low-pressure troughs.

 One trough extended from central India to Gangetic Bengal. In the upper atmosphere, another low-pressure trough stretched from Uttar Pradesh to Arunachal Pradesh. As a result of these systems, there was heavy incursion of moisture from the Bay of Bengal, leading to formation of thunderclouds over south-west Calcutta, said director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore G.C. Debnath.

 The evening rain brought down the temperature by about two degrees Celsius. As moisture continues to be sucked in from the sea, the sky is expected to remain partly cloudy for the next couple of days, said a Met official.

 Over the past week, there has been incursion of moisture into Calcutta and the rest of Gangetic Bengal, leading to dense fog in the morning, which disrupted flight and train services.

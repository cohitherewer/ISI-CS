 The urban development department will build another bridge over the Bagha Jatin railway crossing, said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya.

 The new bridge, to cost Rs 25 crore, will come up alongside the existing one, a part of which collapsed a fortnight ago. A study by experts from Jadavpur University had concluded that the construction was substandard. The damaged part of the overbridge will be demolished and repaired over the next three months, Bhattacharya said.

 The new bridge will be built and financed by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), except for the part over the railway crossing, which will be the responsibility of the railways.

 Bhattacharya had called a meeting with the Eastern Railway general manager, railway engineers and urban development department officials on Wednesday to discuss the overbridge collapse.

 Even the railway officials admitted that Ircon, which constructed the bridge, had deviated from the design. Officials of the CMDA have written to Ircon, asking them to shoulder the blame for the shoddy work, said the minister. Ircon had also done substandard work while constructing the Dum Dum underpass three years ago.

 The urban development department and the railways will join hands to construct 12 more overbridges over railway crossings.

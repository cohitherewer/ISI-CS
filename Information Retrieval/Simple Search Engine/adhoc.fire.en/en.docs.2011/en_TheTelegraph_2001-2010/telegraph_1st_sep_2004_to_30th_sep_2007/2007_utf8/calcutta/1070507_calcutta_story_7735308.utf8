 More takers for distance study 

 - Working youngsters opt for flexible courses

 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE 

 Riddhi Banerjee is a 21-year-old working in a business process outsourcing (BPO) company. He took up the job after his Class XII examinations, hoping to study and earn at the same time. But irregular hours and stress proved a challenge.

 Poulami Banerjee started working after graduation but she had always wanted to do her masters. 

 Distance education was the only option for Riddhi and Poulami. Once looked down upon, this mode of learning is now gaining ground among working professionals.

 The BPO boom and the increase in the number of working youngsters are behind the surge in popularity of distance education. The demand is not limited to the young. Professionals stuck in a rut due to a lack of formal education are also turning to distance learning. 

 According to director of the Sikkim Manipal University centre in Calcutta Debashish Gupta: Distance education appeals to people with limited time. Working professionals, especially those who are losing out because of lack of formal education, opt for it.

 Figures bear out the trend. Enrolment in the distance learning courses offered by Sikkim Manipal University has almost doubled in the past two years, from about 30,000 annually. The city centre of Annamalai University has 5,000 students from the state enrolling per year.

 I wanted to complete my education but had to take up a job. I am doing a distance learning BBA course from Madurai Kamraj University so that I can pursue an MBA later, says Riddhi. The good part is I already have more experience than others my age and am earning as much as any graduate.

 For Poulami, a postgraduate degree from Sikkim Manipal University has been a bonus. The degree is almost useless now. But it has opened the possibility of a career switch later, she says.

 While BBA, MBA, BCA and MCA are the most popular distance learning courses among mid-career professionals, general degrees and specialised diplomas are sought after by those who are starting out.

 Sujit Ghosh, regional director, Indira Gandhi National Open University, points out: Distance education is different from correspondence courses, which have become obsolete. There are contact classes and regular interactions with professors. Self-learning material is provided to each student. 

 Classes of shorter duration and flexible timings are the primary draws for distance learning students. Depending on the type of course, the number of classes varies from zero to five per week. The fees are generally less than those for equivalent courses in private colleges.

 Academics warn that a distance learning degree without work experience may not be enough. Freshers who opt for distance learning might find the going tough. There are companies that are rigid about where the degrees have been obtained from. But most firms, especially those in industries where manpower is scarce, are only concerned about the quality of work, says Sandeep Mukherjee of People Power, a HR firm in the city.

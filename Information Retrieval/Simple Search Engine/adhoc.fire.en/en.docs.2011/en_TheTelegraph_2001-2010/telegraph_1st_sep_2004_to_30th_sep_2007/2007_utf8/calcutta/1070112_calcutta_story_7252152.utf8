The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Kirstie Alley, actress

 You are curious and charismatic; you need to be more open and friendly. Your opinionated nature can interfere in your relationships. Your inability to forget the past robs you of the joys of the present. You are not afraid of hard work or new challenges. You are very careful with your money. You are an admirer of both the new and the traditional. Kusum Bhandari

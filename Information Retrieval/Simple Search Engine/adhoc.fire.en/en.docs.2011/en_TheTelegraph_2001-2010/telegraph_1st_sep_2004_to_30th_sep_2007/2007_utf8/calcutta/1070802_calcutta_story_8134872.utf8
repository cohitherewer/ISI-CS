The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Partner bridges the hit divide

 - Salman Khan-Govinda starrer gathers steam after strong opening

 Salman Khan and Govinda in Partner

 Partner has Cash-ed in. Seven months into 2007, Bollywood has finally scored a hit across both multiplexes and single-screen theatres. After plex successes like Life in a Metro and Namastey London and standalone hits like Aap Kaa Surroor and Apne, Govinda and Salmans partnership has given the country and the city the first blockbuster across all types of theatres.

 Yes, its been a huge hit and it is doing particularly well in the Bengal territory, Partner director David Dhawan tells Metro from Goa. Everyone felt that the collections will drop after the spectacular opening, but they have only got better.

 Precisely so, with the INOX multiplexes at both Forum and City Centre increasing the number of daily shows from eight in Week One to 10 in the second week. That has helped Partner match the whopping Rs 42-lakh-plus total collection in Calcutta in the first week. In fact, collections on the second Sunday was more than that on the first Sunday, which shows how Partner has gone from strength to strength, says Subhasish Ganguly, the general manager of INOX (City Centre).

 What worked in Partners favour was the postponing of last Fridays big release, Anubhav Sinhas Cash, by a week. We had to attend to a court case slapped by one of the original producers of the film, says Sinha. 

 Yes, I would have loved to release Cash last week, when there was no other Bollywood release and even Partner was a week old, admits Sinha. Now Cash will tussle with Gandhi My Father and two Hollywood animation films Simpsons: The Movie and Surfs Up this Friday, besides taking on Partner.

 Above everything else, Partner can be seen as Govindas return to form. This was the first proper Govinda film to release in a multiplex, points out Prashant Srivastava from 89 Cinemas. Yes, Salaam-e-Ishq and Bhagam Bhag were there, but they cant be called his films. With Partner, Govinda is back with a bang and this time, even the plexes have lapped him up.

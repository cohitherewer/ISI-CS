The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Saving tangible heritage

 - Aid to preserve museums from disasters

 SUBHRO SAHA

 AusHeritage has offered to help Victoria Memorial preserve its collection better through non-toxic pest-control methods

 Australia is keen to offer its expertise in helping Calcuttas museums preserve their collections better and also equip them to react with alacrity to disasters.

 Our strength lies in preserving tangible heritage and we are keen to work with cultural institutes of Calcutta and even try to catalyse international funding to assist projects here, Vinod Daniel, chairman, AusHeritage, Australias network for cultural heritage services, told Metro.

 Daniel was in town to deliver a lecture at the Victoria Memorial on best practices from small museums and crises that face our museums. 

 His trip came in the wake of an MoU signed between AusHeritage and INTACH last week to collaborate in cultural heritage initiatives.

 The MoU signals the close and growing collaboration between the two countries in preserving cultural heritage, Australian high commissioner to India John McCarthy had said at the signing in Delhi.

 We want to work with the Victoria Memorial authorities by helping them with non-toxic alternatives for pest-control and also with their outreach programme in the Northeast, said the Chennai-born chemical engineer, ex-IIT Delhi and IIT Chennai, who moved to Sydney in 1995.

 The idea is to adopt a rational approach in using limited resources to minimise the worst risks like insects and disasters like fire or flood. 

 Victoria Memorial curator Chittaranjan Panda felt while intellectual inputs were needed for the Northeast projects, AusHeritage could chip in with tech transfer and funds mobilisation.

 AusHeritage is Australias international network for cultural heritage services. 

 Its members include businesses and institutions employing conservation architects and planners, museum and archive planners, materials conservators, historians, archaeologists and other heritage professionals.

 It has taken up several initiatives in India, including providing support for developing a new exhibition gallery at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Museum, Mumbai, and organising strategic workshops on Caring of collection against disasters and pests.

 Victoria Memorial could be a start and an example for the entire conservation community, stressed Daniel.

 The key is to do many more pilot initiatives and build people-to-people relations. For instance, AusHeritage can also help in cultural mapping, he added.

 Such mapping involves creating distinctive cultural districts by letting the local community decide whats important there and, thus, develop defined tourist attractions. Cultural heritage can then address other key areas for sustainability he added.

 Daniel felt museums internationally are going through a period of soul-searching and questioning. Are they just storehouses for relics and occasionally exhibiting a small portion of their collections or do they have a significant role in todays society whether it is a debate on climate change or the loss of a species or habitat

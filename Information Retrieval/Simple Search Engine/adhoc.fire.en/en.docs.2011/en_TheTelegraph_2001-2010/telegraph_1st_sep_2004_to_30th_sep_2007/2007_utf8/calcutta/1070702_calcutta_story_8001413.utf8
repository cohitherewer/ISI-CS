 Taking a leaf out of the Calcutta Municipal Corporations book, the state government has decided to revive its only market in the city, in Orphangunge, behind Alipore zoo.

 If the land and land reforms department has its way, the dilapidated market which stands on more than 36 bighas may soon metamorphose into Kidderpore Mall, complete with all modern amenities.

 Weve decided to give the old market a makeover with a private promoter. Ive asked my officers for a concept paper, said land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah, whose department owns the market.

 According to the plan, the revamped market will include an underground parking lot for trucks, an unloading bay with a weigh bridge and conveyor belts, a cold storage and an auction yard.

 There will also be a leisure and recreation centre along Tollys Nullah, which flows past the plot. A part of the canal can be dredged and beautified, and used for boating. Food courts can come up on the banks, said an official.

 On June 19, the 400-odd stall-owners were summoned to the office of the South 24-Parganas district magistrate and briefed on the makeover exercise.

 They feared they would lose their livelihood, but we made it clear to them that every stall-owner will be rehabilitated in the new market. Weve sought support from the local Trinamul Congress MLA, Tapas Pal, said Mollah.

 The department plans to start the revamp with the cattle corner, where even camels are sold.

 In recent times, the civic body has undertaken renovation of three of its 23 markets, all through private promoters.

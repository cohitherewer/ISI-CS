 Simply cook and co-exist

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Friday tried to unite a woman and her daughter-in-law, fighting over their right to enter the kitchen for the past six months.

 Justice Girish Gupta ordered Aditi Mukherjee, 28, to unlock the kitchen so that mother-in-law Amita, 53, could enter. It is a family dispute and should be solved within the family, said Gupta.

 Cook together and try to live peacefully for a fortnight and then come to me with your problems, he told the duo.

 It is a novel effort. I believe my client will now lead a happy life with her family, Bharati Mutsuddi, the advocate appearing for Aditi, said on Friday.

 According to Amitas lawyers, Amit Maity and Tarun Chatterjee, trouble started six months ago when Aditi locked the kitchen and kept the key with her, refusing to let her mother-in-law in. 

 The lawyers also alleged that mental torture by Aditi had forced Amita to lodge a complaint with Kasba police station. Abhijit, Aditis husband, had tried to persuade her to be friendly towards her mother-in-law, but failed. Aditi and her daughter have been staying separately in the same building for the past six months, they said. 

 However, Aditis lawyer opposed the claim, saying: It is my client who is a victim of mental and physical torture meted out by her mother-in-law and husband. Her husband even stopped paying the school fees for their six-year-old daughter. But since Aditi wanted to lead a peaceful life, she did not lodge a complaint. 

 On Friday, the judge spoke to each member of the family separately. Abhijit alleged: My wife has made our lives miserable. I eat lunch at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation canteen and my mother at a hotel every day.

 The judge ordered the Aditi and Amita to appear in the court after a fortnight.

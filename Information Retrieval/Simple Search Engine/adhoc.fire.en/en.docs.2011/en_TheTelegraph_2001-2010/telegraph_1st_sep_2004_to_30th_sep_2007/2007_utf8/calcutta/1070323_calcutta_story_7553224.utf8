 Feblex Ortiz Aeduardo Antonio, the Mexican national arrested on Wednesday night for his mid-air antics, has been remanded in judicial custody till March 28.

 He was taken to Barrackpore court around 12.30 pm on Thursday, but was not produced before the magistrate.

 Antonio, 47, travelling on a New Delhi-bound flight from Bangkok, beat up a co-passenger and threatened to trigger a blast, forcing the pilot to make an unscheduled landing at Calcutta airport on Wednesday afternoon.

 He has been charged under various sections of the Civil Aviation Act. A medical test performed on him could not prove that he was drunk, said Antonios counsel Krishnendu Sarkar. 

 The prosecution prayed for time to gather more evidence against him. If the charges can be proved, Antonio may be jailed for 10 years, said public prosecutor H. Bhattacharjee.

 Police are probing Antonios statement that he worked as a journalist in Bangkok.

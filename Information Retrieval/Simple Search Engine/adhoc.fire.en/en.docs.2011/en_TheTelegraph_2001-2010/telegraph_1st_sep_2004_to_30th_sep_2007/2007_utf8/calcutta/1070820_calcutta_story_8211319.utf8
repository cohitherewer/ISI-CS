Two gun-toting youths marched through a crowded lane off Park Street on Sunday afternoon and fired twice in the air, before running way.

 They also threatened local residents with dire consequences if they dared call police.

 One of them, identified as Mohd Shakeel, was later arrested in the Ripon Street area.

 The police suspect the duo had come to the lane to terrorise local businessmen into coughing up money. It was a terror tactic linked to extortion. They had no intention of killing anyone. Or else, they wouldnt have fired in the air, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (south).

 It was around 12.15pm when the youths, in their late-20s, entered Collin Lane that connects Free School Street and Collin Street. They came from the Collin Street-end and walked a few steps before bringing out their firearms. They stopped in the middle of the lane, fired in the air almost simultaneously and ran towards Free School Street, said Imam Ali, a local resident.

 The gunshots sent people scurrying for cover, with most shop-owners downing shutters.

 Officers of Park Street police station said extortionists have become active in the area because of a boom in the hotel trade. More than 10 guest houses and hotels have come up in and around the lane in the past few years, said an officer.

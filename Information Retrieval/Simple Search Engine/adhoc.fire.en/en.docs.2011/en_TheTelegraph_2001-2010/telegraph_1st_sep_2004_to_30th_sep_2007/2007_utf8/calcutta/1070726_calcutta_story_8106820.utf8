 Cheat trader missing with kin 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A Calcutta-based leather exporter, Manzoor Imam, has disappeared with his wife and children after allegedly cheating several businessmen of Rs 2.5 crore over the past six months.

 He reportedly sold his house and two offices in Park Circus before fleeing.

 The fraud came to light following a police complaint lodged by Abdul Mannan, who supplied raw leather to Imam. 

 I supplied leather worth Rs 45 lakh to Imam for the past two months. He gave me a cheque for Rs 45 lakh on May 29. But when I submitted the cheque in the bank, it bounced, said Mannan.

 Mannan immediately called Imam on his cellphone, but it was switched off. 

 I became suspicious and went to his office the next day. It was closed. When I went to his house in the first week of June, I found he had sold it off, Mannan recalled.

 He lodged a complaint with the detective department on June 10. A preliminary probe revealed that Imam used to export leather goods to European and West Asian countries.

 He was a big exporter and owned two offices in the Park Circus area. He has disappeared with his wife and children, after selling off his house and properties in the city. We have interrogated his three brothers, but they are clueless about his whereabouts, said an officer of the anti-fraud section of the detective department.

 More complaints are pouring in against Imam and it seems the total amount he cheated from people over the past six months is around Rs 2.5 crore, said another officer.

 Imam stopping paying his suppliers after convincing them that he was in a financial mess. He promised to pay them by June but fled before that, the officer added.

 An officer recalled a similar incident in the same area: Arshad Ali, a leather exporter, cheated several suppliers of Rs 1.5 crore and fled to Saudi Arabia along with his family. 

 A probe revealed that he had cheated two banks of Rs 40 lakh, the officer added.

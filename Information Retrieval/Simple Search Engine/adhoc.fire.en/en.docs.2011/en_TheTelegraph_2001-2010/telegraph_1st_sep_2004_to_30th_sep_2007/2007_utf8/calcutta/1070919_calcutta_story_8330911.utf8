 From darkness to light

 Ratnakar charts the transformation of a dacoit into the man who composed the epic, Ramayana. Based loosely on the life of Valmiki, it shows Ratnakar robbing wayfarers in order to feed his family. He has no qualms about his acts since necessity has forced him into this profession. One day he comes across Brahma in all his glittering grandeur. Brahma is willing to give away all to him if he is able to answer a question Will any of his family members be willing to share his burden of sin? Ratnakar realises his helplessness.Though he tries to repent he fails; it takes his entire life to overcome the sinful passions.The dramatist shows the relevance of this story in our times where mindless violence is being carried out in the name of duty. A little self-questioning would lead these people to the path of truth.The play is styled on folk drama. Director, playwright and major performer: Gunakar Dev Goswami.

 Event: Play in Assamese, Ratnakar, produced by Purbaranga When: Today at 6 pm Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB 201 Salt Lake

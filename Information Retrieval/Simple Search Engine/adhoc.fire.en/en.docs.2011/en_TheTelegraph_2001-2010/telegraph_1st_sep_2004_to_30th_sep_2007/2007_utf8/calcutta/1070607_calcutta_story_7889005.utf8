 The sweltering heat is just half their agony, the other half being frequent and prolonged power cuts.

 Major parts of Calcutta, Salt Lake and their adjoining areas have been reeling under severe power cuts for more than a week. And the authorities couldnt care less, if the residents are to be believed. 

 Several parts of central Calcutta have been going without electricity for more than eight to 10 hours daily.

 For the past week, we havent had power for the the better part of the day. It goes off around 11am and returns late in the evening. Several hours in the night, too, are spent without power, said a resident of Ganesh Chandra Avenue.

 The situation is worse for the children and the aged. We cannot take them out, as they face a tough time climbing up the stairs during power cuts, when the lift stops. Inside, its claustrophobic without fans and the air-conditioner, said Mitali Bhansali, who lives on Ganesh Chandra Avenue.

 The residents allege that the CESC has not taken any step to solve the problem. We do not know whom to approach with our woes. Whenever we call, the official on the other side replies rudely and doesnt seem bothered about our problems. The toll-free number of the CESC never works, says Daulat Bodhonwala, of Ganesh Chandra Avenue.

 The power utility has attributed the problem to the rise in demand because of the current spell of heat. The situation will return to normal once the monsoon arrives and the peak-hour demand comes down, said a CESC spokesperson.

 For the Chatterjees of Salt Lake, its back to the dark days and nights of the 80s, when normal supply was an exception rather than the rule.

 The power cuts in the past week, for hours together, have been murderous. Whats worse is that no one seems to be bothered about our problems. And there is no remedial attempt either, says an agitated Chanda Chatterjee, 71

 She lives at BA 115 a 10-minute walk from Bidyut Bhavan, that houses the power department with husband Ranendra Nath Chatterjee, 78.

 Its so hot that one cannot live without an AC. But thanks to power cuts, we hardly get an opportunity to switch on the AC, or the microwave and the refrigerator, that are so much a part of our lives, says Chanda.

 They blame their woes on the lack of professionalism of the authorities. There should be some degree of professionalism in the way things are run. If the electricity board is undertaking any repairs or upgrade work, it should inform us beforehand. If we know the time and duration of the power cut, we can plan things accordingly, said Ranendra Nath.

 We hope the situation will start improving from July, when the first unit of the Purulia pump-storage hydel project is expected to start generation. Till then, nothing much can be done, said M.K. Roy, director (commercial), West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited.

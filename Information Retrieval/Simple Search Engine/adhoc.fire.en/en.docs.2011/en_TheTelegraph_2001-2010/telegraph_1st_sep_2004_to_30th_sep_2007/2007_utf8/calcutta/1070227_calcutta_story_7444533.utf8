 A high court-appointed panel has accused the state government of failing to curb pollution of the Hooghly, despite spending crores under the Ganga Action Plan (GAP).

 The three major sources of pollution of the river in the city are the Adi Ganga, Bally khal and the Nazirgunj nullah they release untreated sewage of Calcutta and Howrah into the Hooghly. 

 No steps have been taken to tackle this problem ever since GAP was launched 22 years ago, said Kalyan Rudra, a member of the panel set up to suggest ways to fight Ganga pollution.

 Besides, most of the 25 sewage treatment plants installed along the river are faulty, wrongly located and grossly under-utilised, added Rudra, who is also Bengals representative in the core team of the National Flood Management.

 The committee met at Writers Buildings on Monday to discuss the interim report it will submit to the high court in a week. We will plead for a separate authority for the Hooghly, since the present custodian, Calcutta Port Trust, has not been able to fulfil its responsibility, said environment secretary M.L. Meena, chairman of the committee. 

 A key concern for the committee is the five-seven jute mills on the northern fringes of the city that have encroached on the river bed by dumping rubbish.

 Senior law officer in the environment department Biswajit Mukherjee said Dunbar Cotton Mill is even constructing a housing estate on land reclaimed from the river. The authorities have been asked to scrap the project, he added.

 Rudra said the panel will highlight the reasons behind the failure of GAP, under which Rs 400 crore has been spent in the state alone since 1985. There has been a total management failure, thanks to a lack of coordination among various government agencies and municipalities.

 Another member pointed out: Around 1,000 brick kilns have come up on the river banks, with most even encroaching on the river bed. Labourers use the banks to relieve themselves.

 Apart from Meena, Rudra and Mukherjee, those who attended the meeting were environmentalist Subhas Dutta and officials of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, public health engineering department and All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health.

 Card fraud for air fares

 A STAFF REPORTER

Sleuths of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested a youth on Thursday for online purchase of air tickets against someone elses credit card number. 

 Keying in credit card details of Sudipto Nandi, a resident of Konnagar, in Hooghly, Sashi Turi had booked air tickets worth around Rs 16,000 from the airlines site. 

 According to Rajeev Kumar, the deputy inspector-general of police (operations), CID, Nandi learnt about the fraud from a text message sent by the bank that had issued him the credit card. 

 He immediately lodged a complaint with our cyber crime wing, as he had never made any online purchases, said Kumar, adding that the number of complaints about credit card fraud has increased in the past few months. 

 The sleuths got in touch with the airline and collected the PNR number of the tickets and the details of the passengers with those tickets. 

 But the addresses were fake. So we went to the airport on the date of the journey. A couple with their child were travelling on the tickets, said a CID official. 

 During questioning, the passenger told the cops he had paid a travel agent in cash for the tickets. When the cops zeroed in on the travel agent, he named Sashi. The travel agent had paid Sashi cash to buy the tickets, but the young man used Nandis credit card details and made online bookings, said the official. 

 During interrogation, Sashi confessed that he had got the card details from an associate. It seems there is a racket that steals peoples credit card details and operates with it, said the official.

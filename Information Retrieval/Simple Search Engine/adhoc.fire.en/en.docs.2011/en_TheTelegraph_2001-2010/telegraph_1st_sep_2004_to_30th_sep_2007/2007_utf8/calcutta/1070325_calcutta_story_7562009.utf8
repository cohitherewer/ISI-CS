 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Murguma

 It was five on a cold November morning when we arrived at Muri Junction station by the Howrah-Hatia Express. A thick blanket of fog had enveloped the surroundings in the half light of dawn. 

 As a child, I had crossed the station on the same train several times, but had never got down. The region was a part of my earliest memories and I was ready to know it more intimately.

 My two companions were having tea in earthen cups shaped like saucers, which are common in the area. I joined in before boarding the car waiting for us. 

 The journey along a typical Chhotanagpur road was refreshing. The fog lifted after some time and we stopped to take pictures of the sunrise. An unmetalled road, branching off the main one, took us to the village of Murguma. Our destination was Aaranyak Tent Resort, a few kilometres from the hamlet. 

 Outside the village, the car drove up on an embankment that offered a wonderful view of a giant lake with tiny islands on it. We halted again to be delighted by the sight of shimmering water and took some snaps.

 A man fishing in the lake on a raft smiled and waved at us asking for a copy of the pictures. We waved back and continued on our way. 

 After a 15-minute drive through jungle tracks, we reached the resort on a bank of the lake. The owner greeted us and gave us a quick tour of the area. The colourful tents, of various shapes and sizes, were well-appointed. The Ayodhya hills and forest formed the backdrop. There were several species of birds around, especially parrots. 

 After a hearty breakfast, we set out to explore. I noticed a handful of small tents next to the lake. They were meant for anglers. Occasionally, fishing competitions are organised, said the resort owner. 

 In the afternoon, we went on a jungle jaunt. Sal, Piyal and Mohul were in abundance. The guide pointed out a few orchids as well. We crossed the streams on foot. Near one of them, there were footprints of elephants.

 The villagers were very friendly. We chatted with them, took snaps of the children and had a whale of a time riding a bullock cart. The tribal girls burst into laughter as we tried to goad the reluctant animals to advance. We took to more user-friendly bicycles before long.

 As dusk gave way to evening, the sky filled with stars. We put the telescope at the resort to good use and added to our knowledge of the constellations. Soon, it was time for a bonfire, accompanied by barbecued chicken and the local brew, mohua. I spent some time on a treetop machaan with tribal night guards armed with poisoned arrows. A sumptuous dinner followed. 

 I woke up at dawn to birdsong and found a squirrel peeping out of my tent. After a very urban breakfast of cornflakes and fruits, we tried our hands at rock climbing. Rappelling down stony cliffs was great fun. The sessions are organised on special request. I also practised a bit of archery. 

 After lunch, consisting of mostly local vegetables, we headed on a jeep for the ruins of the Ashoka dynasty at Deulghata. We were back at the resort by dark.

 As the stars made their appearance, the beats of the madal and a troupe of Santhali dancers livened up the evening, providing a fitting finale to our tour.

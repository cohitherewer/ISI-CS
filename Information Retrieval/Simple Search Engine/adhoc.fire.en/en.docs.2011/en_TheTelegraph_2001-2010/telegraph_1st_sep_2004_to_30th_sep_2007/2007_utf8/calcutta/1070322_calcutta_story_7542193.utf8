 Some of the ongoing, big-ticket construction projects in the state including Kolkata West International City (by Salim group) and the revamp of Batanagar (by Riverbank Holding) have not yet been issued the environment clearance.

 Not because of any fault of the projects or their promoters, but because the twin panels that are to issue the approvals have not been constituted. Thanks to the delay, the promoters of more than 100 industrial and residential projects are worried about meeting the deadline.

 A notification issued by the Centre on September 14, 2006, states that all residential and a few industrial projects will have to obtain green nod from a three-member Environment Impact Assessment Authority, which will act on inputs from an environment appraisal committee.

 The state government, according to the notification, has to propose the names of the members of both the authority and the committee for approval by the Centre.

 The proposals, including the names of the members, were forwarded to the Centre two months ago. The clearance will come anytime, said state environment secretary M.L. Meena. Sources said the chief ministers office, too, has taken up the matter with Delhi.

 An official in the Union government, however, said the proposals were received only a week ago and it will take about a month for the environment and forest ministry to process them.

 Director of the ministry G.B. Subramaniam said: The original proposals did not contain the bio-data of some of the proposed members. Those were sent to us on 12 March, after we pointed out the lapse to the state government. We are now processing the proposals.

 A section of officials, however, attributed the delay in formalising the authority and the committee to the Union ministrys reservation over some of the proposed names.

 The industry lobby fears the adverse impact of the delay on the projects. All major construction work has been stalled at our site, said a representative of the company developing Kolkata West. The application for the environmental clearance was moved in July 2006 through Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority. Its still pending, he added. 

 Sumit Dabriwala, of Riverbank Holding, said: We are happy with the notification but worried over the delay in setting up the authority.

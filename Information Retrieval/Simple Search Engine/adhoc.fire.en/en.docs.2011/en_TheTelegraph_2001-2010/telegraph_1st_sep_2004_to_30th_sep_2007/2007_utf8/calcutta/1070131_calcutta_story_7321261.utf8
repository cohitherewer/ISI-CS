 Fun and frolic with a dash of funda was the theme of Spring Fest 2007, the annual inter-collegiate festival of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur. From Bollywood chartbusters and headbangers ball to star turns on stage, the fest on the campus, which kicked off on January 25, was a blast.

 The railway and tourism theme fest, with The Telegraph as its media sponsor, was inaugurated by V.K. Raina, general manager, South Eastern Railway.

 The four-day jamboree kicked off with a high-energy performance by the Eastern Technology Music Society of IIT Kharagpur. We had a footfall of around 12,000 over four days. We had made special arrangements for guests from across the country at the residential halls, said Yagnish Rathi, a student of IIT Kharagpur.

 Star Nites were the biggest crowd-pullers, with Shivani Kashyap, Band of Boys and Shaan regaling the audience at the Tagore Open Air Theatre with popular Bollywood and Indipop numbers. We had a 5,000-plus audience in the open amphitheatre, with another 1,000 outside, said Sunny Chhabra, a student of IIT Kharagpur.

 Day events, encompassing literature and music, drew a crowd of enthusiasts. Events like Antakshari, eastern and western vocals saw a record turnout.

 Centrifuge, the inter-college dance competition, was an eclectic mix of Punjabi, western and Indian classical styles with 10 teams fighting for the top spot. Fine Frenzy, the annual fashion parade, saw exclusive designs and models. Designers Dev and Neel judged the event. National School of Hotel Management, Durgapur, won, while IIT Kharagpur came second.

 Other star events were Hasya Kavi Sammelan, Rangamancha, drama competition, and sarod recitals by Amaan Ali Khan and Ayaan Ali Khan on the final evening.

 The final night saw a performance by Third Eye from Darjeeling, who won the Wildfire contest, before the Delhi-based band Prestorika took the stage and brought down the curtains for the extravaganza.

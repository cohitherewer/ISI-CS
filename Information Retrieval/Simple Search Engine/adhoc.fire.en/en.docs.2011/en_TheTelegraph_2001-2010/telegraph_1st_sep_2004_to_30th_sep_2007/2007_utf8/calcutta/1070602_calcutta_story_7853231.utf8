 Panels to study emission scanner

 The state government has formed two committees to assess the feasibility of using remote-sensing devices to track tailpipe emission of moving vehicles. A pilot study of the device was conducted recently. 

 The panels, looking after the technical and financial aspects of installing the devices on roads, are likely to submit their reports by mid-June, said state environment secretary M.L. Meena.

 The technical committee will also suggest how the data thrown up the devices could be used for taking action against violators, under the Motor Vehicles Act, Air Act and Environment (Protection) Act.

 The first meeting of the technical committee will soon be held, said panel member Biswajit Mukherjee, who is also senior law officer in the environment department.

 As the devices are expensive, the government is considering hiring them initially.

 A remote sensing device measures the emission of a vehicle and takes its snap while it passes by. Now, a vehicle needs to be stopped for at least half an hour for pollution tests using a gas analyser or a smoke meter.

 The pilot study proved that commercial vehicles like taxis and goods-carriers are the most polluting in the city, Meena said.

 Of the vehicles scanned, 53 per cent of the two-wheelers, 42 per cent of the three-wheeler goods vehicles, 18 per cent of the trucks and 15 per cent of the taxis were found to be gross polluters. The study did not cover buses and autorickshaws as the roads where the devices were installed are out of bounds for them.

 A section of green activists, however, is sceptical about the efficacy of the remote sensing machines. These can operate on stretches with single-line traffic. But on all major Calcutta roads, vehicles ply in multiple lines, said Subhas Dutta.

 Auto-emission expert S.M. Ghosh said: For the device to function, there has to be some space between two vehicles, so drivers could accelerate. But thats hardly possible on city roads that witness almost bumper-to-bumper traffic most of the time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Top of class in air toxicity

 - RPM density 1.5 times the national standard, says report

 JAYANTA BASU

 With foul fumes vitiating the citys air quality, Calcutta is racing ahead of other metros in terms of pollution levels. 

 According to a recent Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) report, the concentration of respirable particulate matter (RPM) small enough to damage the lungs in the city is 1.5 times the national standard. The level of hazardous nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the ambient air is 65 micrograms, five notches above the national standard (see box).

 Even Delhi has high RPM and NOx levels. But in Delhi, the trend is declining, while in Calcutta its the opposite, said Anumita Roy Choudhury, researcher with the Delhi-based organisation. 

 The CSE numbers were thrown up during an exercise to study the pollution levels in various Asian cities. The researchers, led by Roy Choudhury, also looked at 12 Indian cities, under the judicial scanner on air pollution issues. 

 Though the West Bengal Pollution Control Board has its own set of pollution statistics, it has in principle agreed with the CSE findings. 

 Its a double whammy for Calcutta. Its air is laden with high levels of both particulate matter less than 10 micron (RPM) and nitrogen oxide, said Dipak Chakrabarty, chief scientist of the board. 

 According to Chakrabarty, automobiles contribute nearly 50 per cent to the citys overall air pollution load.

 It is clear that vehicular pollution is responsible for the poor air quality in the city, echoed Roy Choudhury. 

 The CSE played a critical role in the introduction of CNG in Delhi, which has contributed to lower pollution levels in the Capital. 

 But alternative fuel has remained a far cry in Calcutta. With green activists highlighting the problem before the high court, the issue of poor air quality in Calcutta has now raced to the courtrooms. Green activist Subhas Duttas case on auto emission is scheduled to come up for hearing on Monday.

 The situation is worsening every day but the government is doing precious little to ensure fresh air to the people. So, our only hope is the judiciary, said Dutta.

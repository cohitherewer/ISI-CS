The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fliers wait for 14 hours

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Around 200 passengers were stranded at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport for 14 hours on Sunday, as the Bangkok-Calcutta flight of Thai Airways, that was scheduled to take them to Bangkok, could not land due to bad weather.

 An altercation broke out between airport officials and the passengers, but the situation was brought under control after the authorities announced that the passengers would be flown out by another flight. The flight was scheduled to land at 1am but strong crosswinds forced us to divert it to Dhaka, an airport official said.

 Among the passengers was a 157-member team comprising cardiologists and their families. They were on their way to Singapore to attend a conference aboard a cruise.

 We checked in at midnight, as the flight was scheduled to take off at 2am, said cardiologist Sanjeev Kumar. At 3am, there was an announcement that the flight was diverted and would return after refuelling. But around 5.30am, the airline announced that the flight had returned to Bangkok, said Kumar. The airline said it was the pilots decision to take the aircraft to Bangkok.

 The passengers alleged that the airline did not make any arrangements for their stay, nor did any official speak to them about the delay. Central Industrial Security Force personnel arranged food for the children. 

 The passengers were finally flown to Bangkok in another aircraft at 2.30pm but the doctors had missed the cruise. They will be provided a special aircraft from Bangkok to Penang, where they will board the cruiseliner.

 We could not provide accommodation to the passengers as the star hotels near the airport were booked, said Krisnapong Srisinwarakool, the general manager of Thai Airways, Calcutta.

 Smoking ban at JU

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 After Calcutta University, Jadavpur University (JU) on Wednesday banned smoking in certain zones on its two campuses.

 The decision was finalised at a meeting of JUs executive council, the highest policy-making body of the university.

 We have identified the areas on the Jadavpur and Salt Lake campuses where smoking will not be allowed, said Parthapratim Biswas, a senior teacher and a member of the JU executive council. The ban will come into immediate effect.

 The no-smoking zones include the heritage area on the main campus, the academic and administrative buildings, libraries and laboratories.

 Sale of cigarettes has also been banned on and around the campuses. The authorities will seek the help of local police to stop the sale of cigarettes and narcotics around the campuses.

 To ensure implementation of the ban, the members of the executive council on Wednesday decided to create awareness among students, teachers, employees and even guardians on the need for the move. 

 We will soon hold a meeting with students and teachers to discuss ways of generating awareness, stated Biswas. 

 The University Grants Commission had recently issued a circular directing the authorities of all universities in the country to ban smoking on their campuses.

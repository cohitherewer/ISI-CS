 Highlighting social conflicts

 A set of four plays based on short stories by city-based authors, Katha Collage- 2 is the second part of a series introducing a new genre in Indian theatre. Derived from the narrative tradition of ancient performing arts, it relies on stage performances with bare, minimum theatricality. Shailendra Srivastavas Sapne Ki Baat (Hindi) protests against the non-inclusion of women in funeral processions on the grounds that it is inauspicious. Sayeed Premis Rihaee (Urdu) is about a womans search for her real identity in a society that considers a wife to be her husbands property. Madhu Kankrias File (Hindi) deals with the problems of street children and children of prostitutes. Anis Rafis Polythene Ki Deewar (Urdu) makes a comment against irresponsible, self-indulgent authors, who write stories far removed from the reality of life. Design and direction: Uma Jhunjhunwala.

 Event: Katha Collage- 2, four plays produced by Little Thespian When: Today at 7 pm Where: Padatiks Buildwell Theatre, 6/7 AJC Bose Road

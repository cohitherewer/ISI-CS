 Judge for method in script scan

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The higher secondary council should be more transparent in evaluation of answer scripts, said Justice Biswanath Somadder of the high court on Monday, during the hearing of pleas by students unhappy with their marks in the exam. 

 The judge, however, did not pass a judgment. He will evaluate the scripts of several students, who had moved court in this regard, on August 20.

 On Monday, Justice Somadder tallied the students answers with the textbooks and the model answers provided by the council to the examiners. Several answers were found to be correct according to the textbooks but wrong according to the model answers. 

 Petitioner Madhurima Mukherjee, who had appeared for CBSE in Class X, showed the judge an answer that was correct according to the CBSE board but incorrect according to the council. Why should the boards have different answers to the same question? asked a student.

 Justice Somadder directed Madhurima to ask her tutors to file an affidavit stating that her higher secondary answers under consideration were correct.

 The judge stated that he was not sure about the correct answer to some of the questions. He added: I feel the council should be methodical while examining answer scripts.

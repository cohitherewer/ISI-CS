 Precedent of zoo plot shift

 - Save-wetlands move 

 JAYANTA BASU 

 The state government will have to repeat what it did 13 years ago to save the East Calcutta Wetlands, if the environmentalists have their way.

 The green brigade is up in arms over the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments decision to shift large animals from Alipore zoo to a new facility at Bhagwanpur mouza, off the EM Bypass. The proposed site is within the wetlands, protected under the Ramsar convention. Theres also a high court order barring development in the area.

 In 1994, Maneka Gandhi, as head of NGO People For Animals (PFA), had approached then chief minister Jyoti Basu for land to set up an animal shelter-cum-hospital in the city. 

 The government agreed and, initially, gave us land near Bantala. The plot was within the protected wetlands. Our chief requested Basu to provide an alternative plot elsewhere, said Debasis Chakrabarti, managing trustee of PFA, Calcutta.

 According to sources, the district magistrate of the area wrote to the organisation asking it to stop construction on the wetlands and reminding it of the high court order in this regard. Justice Umesh Chandra Banerjee had delivered a judgment a couple of years before that, prohibiting construction on the wetlands. 

 The government recognised the need to protect the wetlands and allotted the NGO a plot in Mukundapur.

 We want the large animals to be shifted from Alipore zoo but have nothing to say about where they should be transferred. However, we did shift from Bantala to protect the wetlands, said Chakrabarti. 

 Maneka Gandhi called me to express gratitude when the matter was sorted out, said wetlands expert Dhrubojyoti Ghosh, who mediated between the government and the NGO regarding the plot shift.

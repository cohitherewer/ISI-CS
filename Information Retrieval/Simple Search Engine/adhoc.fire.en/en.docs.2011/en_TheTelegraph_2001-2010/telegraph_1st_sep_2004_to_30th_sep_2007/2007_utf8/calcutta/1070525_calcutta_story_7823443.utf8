 A new-age home for senior citizens has come up in Konnagar, on the banks of the Hooghly, a 45-minute drive from the city.

 Homage has tied up with a hospital for 24x7 emergency medical help for its inmates. Besides, weekly medical check-ups will be arranged free.

 The home has a well-stocked library, Internet access and facilities for indoor games.

 Homage will enable senior citizens to live with dignity and respect without being at the mercy of domestic helps, said Pradeep Kundalia, president of Kundalia Foundation, which runs the home.

 There are 12 double-bed rooms in the home. The rooms have no doors to ensure the inmates can be promptly brought out in an emergency.

 Elderly people often get trapped in a room after falling ill. To rule out the possibility, we have done away with doors, said Sunit Gunakar Mitra, in-charge of Homage. Sliding doors, however, will be provided on request, but there will be no latches.

 An inmate can make a refundable deposit of Rs 2 lakh to the home and pay Rs 7,500 every month. Or he or she can make a one-time payment of Rs 12 lakh and stay in the home free. After the inmates death, half the amount will be given to anyone named in his/her will.

 The home also has 20 flats of 925 sq ft each. An elderly citizen can buy a flat for Rs 9 lakh. After death, the amount will be returned to whoever the person names in the will.

 On Wednesday, 66-year-old Ramen Basu, a retired engineer, became the first inmate of Homage. I feel secure here. Now, I dont have to live at the mercy of others, said Basu. I want to live and die gracefully.

 He said his wife would join him soon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Students pitch for more liveable city 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The youth of Calcutta dream of making the city like Melbourne recently judged the worlds most liveable city by an international agency by 2020. Riding high on history and the information technology boom, the students of various city colleges also have the blueprint to achieve the goal.

 The plans, to make Calcutta the best living city were presented at Youthcon 07, a convention organised by Concern for Calcutta at St Xaviers College auditorium, which saw participation by several colleges and management institutes. The best living city is not just comfortable to live in but also full of life, according to the organisers.

 The convention on September 1 and 2 was inaugurated by mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and attended by the Union minister for youth affairs Mani Shankar Aiyar.

 The minister lauded the students for their enthusiasm and faith but pointed out that any plan for the city should not leave out the economically backward. You need to be more practical in your approach and include the less fortunate in your plans, said Aiyar.

 Concern for Calcutta, an autonomous, non-profit organisation formed in 1948, launched its youth cell last year to involve the younger generation in the mainstream of development. 

 There are some who dream of making Calcutta the queen among cities but there are also those who dont care, said Bhattacharyya, who was the chief guest. 

 The mayor called for the participation of young people can help in maintaining the underground drainage system for reducing waterlogging in the city. Youngsters can help spread awareness about how plastic bags clog up drains, said Bhattacharyya. 

 The guest of honour at the convention was Sharda Fathepuria, the director and secretary of Manovikas Kendra, which works with children with special needs. He appreciated Youthcons effort to bring children of Manovikas Kendra into the mainstream. 

 A panel discussion was also held on the education system in West Bengal and whether it is geared to meet the challenges of the 21st Century. There were also dance and music performances by children of Manovikas Kendra. A one-act skit on Calcutta and its many moods was also staged.

 Father P.C. Matthew, the principal of St Xaviers College, was felicitated.

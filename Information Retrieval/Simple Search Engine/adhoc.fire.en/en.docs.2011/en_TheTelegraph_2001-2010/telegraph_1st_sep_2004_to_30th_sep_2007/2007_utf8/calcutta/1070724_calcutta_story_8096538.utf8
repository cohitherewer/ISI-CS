The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Travel agency under scanner

 A STAFF REPORTER

Investigating officials have zeroed in on a travel agency somewhere in the Karaya area to crack the credit card fraud case. 

 Interrogation of the four persons arrested in connection with the purchase of air tickets over the Internet against someone elses credit card has thrown up the travel agencys name. 

 We are planning a raid at the agencys office, said a police officer. 

 According to him, Imran Khan, the man picked up on Sunday from the Karaya police station area, has revealed that he booked three air tickets through a travel agency in his area. 

 He is a local tout in the Park Circus belt and he gets air tickets made for passengers against a commission, said a police officer. 

 Besides Khan, police have also arrested three air travellers Indrajit Roy, S.K. Sahid and Javed Akhtar Khan in the case. 

 The passengers were arrested at the airport minutes before boarding their respective flights on the basis of a complaint lodged by a Behala businessman, Somnath Sadhukhan. 

 The three tickets two to Delhi and a return ticket to Bhubaneswar were bought over the Internet against Sadhukhans credit card number within a span of few hours. 

 Following the incident, the

 private banks have reiterated their appeal to credit

 card users to follow some basic guidelines while carrying

 out transactions over the Internet..

 But Sadhukhan is still livid with the bank, which has issued him the credit card, for not acting on his request. 

 I had requested them to block my card after learning about the air ticket purchase to Delhi. But in spite of that, another transaction was made and a ticket to Bhubaneswar was bought against my card. I will seek an explanation from them for the delay in blocking the card, he told Metro.

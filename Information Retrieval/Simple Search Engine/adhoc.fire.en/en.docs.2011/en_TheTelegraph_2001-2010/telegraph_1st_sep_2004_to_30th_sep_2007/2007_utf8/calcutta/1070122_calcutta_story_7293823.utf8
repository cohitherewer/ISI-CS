 MITHUN CHAKRABORTY, THE MEDIA BARON IN GURU, TALKS TO MOHUA DAS ABOUT BEING MANIK DASGUPTA, WORKING WITH MANI RATNAM AND TREATING CO-STARS TO ALU POSTO

 Mithun Chakraborty as Manik Dasgupta in Guru

 This is the first time you 

 have worked with Mani Ratnam. How did it happen?

 Nine years ago Mani Ratnam had offered me a role in his film Iruvar but I was unable to do it because he wanted me to cut my hair short. It wasnt possible for me as I was already shooting for another film, which required me to keep my hair long to maintain continuity. Im glad that we have finally worked together. He thought I fitted the character of Manik Dasgupta, who is a newspaper baron and loves Gurukant (Abhishek) like his own son. He is a crusader who helps Gurukant reach the heights. But he also goes against Gurukant when he treads the wrong path.

 How did the shooting of Guru 

 go?

 We shot the film in Chennai. I would order my lunch from a Bengali restaurant called Annapurna, as I always order food from there whenever Im shooting in Chennai. One day I offered food to everyone on the sets before starting my meal and everyone just loved it. The next day onwards, the entire unit was eating from Annapurna. There used to be alu posto, potoler dolma, machher kofta, kosha mangsho and aamer chutney. Abhishek knew how to mix the food since his mother (Jaya) is Bengali, but I had to teach Ash (Aishwarya) how to eat and what order to follow. Most people like cooking but I get a high and a lot of satisfaction treating people to good food!

 What was your experience of 

 working with Mani Ratnam?

 It was a real pleasure. Mani Ratnam is someone I can actually call an actors director. No matter how long you may have been working as an actor, you cannot go beyond the character that is etched out for you and Mani Ratnam knows how to guide you and bring out precisely what he needs in a particular scene. It was simply a treat to work with a director like him and I must admit that he is by far one of the best film-makers Ive worked with till date.

 How were your co-stars in the 

 film?

 I have known Abhishek since the time he was born and it makes me proud to see how mature an actor he has turned out to be today. It was great fun working with him. He has a great sense of humour, hes always jovial and cracking jokes. But what I like the most about him is that he knows how to respect his seniors. 

 Aishwarya is such a loveable darling and Vidya is a great actress with a lot of potential. I have to admit that all of them have a lot of regard for senior actors, which I think is great.

 After this intense role in 

 Guru, are you keen on doing more character roles?

 No, not at all! Ill do any role that feels close to my heart and makes me happy. I have always been open to a variety of roles, be it comedy or action. As long as I know what suits me and the director knows what he wants from me, Im game for anything.

 What are your forthcoming projects 

 and releases?

 I have done a film with Hansal Mehta, about a mafia family, called Raakh starring Sohail Khan and Ishaa Koppikar. It should release by early March. Haranath Chakrabortys Toofan should also release sometime soon. In February, Ill be working for two more Bengali films one by Anup Dasgupta co-starring Debasree and then MLA Fatakeshto 2. 

 How is MLA Fatakeshto-2 

 shaping up?

 Im quite excited about it and waiting to start shooting by February-end. You have to wait and watch. Im not going to say anything now because its going to be a surprise for all.

 Scout DNA test cancelled

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 DOUBTS AT REST: Anil Harishchandra

 Police have cancelled the DNA test on the body of Anil Harishchandra, 15-year-old Scout from Maharashtra found dead in a Rajarhat pond on January 13. The decision follows the final post-mortem report that has dispelled doubts about the identity of the body.

 We dont think there is any need to conduct the DNA test, as the post-mortem clearly concludes that the body was of a 15-year-old boys. Besides, some marks on the body have been identified by Anils family, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, (North 24-Parganas).

 Anil had come to attend a national-level Scouts jamboree from January 2 to7. He had been missing since January 8 afternoon.

 According to the post-mortem report, prepared by a board of three doctors, Anil died by drowning. Traces of food were found in his stomach. Which means the organisers of the meet and Scouts officials had lied when they said Anil had taken a full meal on January 8. Had that been the case, more food should have been found in the stomach. We dont understand why they misled us, said Anils uncle Ashoke Kumar Gupta.

 A preliminary post-mortem had indicated that the body purported to have been Anils was that of a 25-year-olds. 

 A preliminary ossification test, too, had confirmed the findings. But the doctors, before preparing the final post-mortem report, conducted tests on bone density, bone tissues, bone marrow and the genitals and found the body was of a boy between 15 and 16 years of age.

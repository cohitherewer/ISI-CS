The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Showcase for clean tech

 - Fair focuses on renewable energy to cut down on fumes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a bid to cut down on pollution, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Corporation (WBREDA) and the state power department have come together to organise a fair showcasing clean technology.

 The four-day event, being held off EM Bypass, near Energy Park, was inaugurated on Saturday. It strives to make people aware of energy-efficient processes and promote the benefits of renewable energy sources over fossil fuels.

 Kirit Parikh, Planning Commission member for energy utilisation and promotion of renewable energy, told Metro at the fair that the Centres policy on utilisation of renewable energy sources has changed recently.

 It is time to dispel the notion that solar and other forms of renewable energy are for villagers and poor people. Such forms of energy are being used in urban areas for illuminating streets and even homes, said Parikh.

 The inter-governmental panel on climate change has published a report indicating an increase in pollution due to greater emission of greenhouse gases, which is posing a threat to the existence of human beings.

 The demand for power is growing and we have to burn fossil fuels to generate it. A lot of fossil fuel is needed in the transport sector, which is affecting our environment. Though clean technology is available, unfortunately, not many are aware of it, said Mrinal Banerjee, state power minister, at the fair.

 Nearly 40 companies that participated in the fair demonstrated products that cut down on power consumption or are run on renewable energy. 

 Once we can reduce energy consumption, we can cut down on pollution. For that to happen, the common man should have easy access to technology for controlling pollution. The fair will promote awareness about such technology, stated S.P. Gan Chowdhury, director of WBREDA.

 The students of IIT Kharagpur demonstrated a device to process bio-diesel.

 Even if we blend bio-diesel with diesel and use it, we can cut down on harmful emission. Nearly a million litres of diesel are used by vehicles in the city every day. By using a bio-diesel blend, we can reduce emission from at least 20,000 litres of diesel, said a student.

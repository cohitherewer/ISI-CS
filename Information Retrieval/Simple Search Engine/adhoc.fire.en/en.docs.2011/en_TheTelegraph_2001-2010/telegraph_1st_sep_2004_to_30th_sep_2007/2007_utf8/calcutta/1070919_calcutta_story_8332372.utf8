The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dust gobbles file, blood flows

 - Two years on, traffic management blueprint remains on paper

 KINSUK BASU

In the winter of 2005, while kicking off the 150-year celebrations of Calcutta Police at Nandan, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had stressed the need to tackle traffic chaos.

 To please the boss, the department drew up a blueprint to recast the traffic management system in town. 

 Metro takes stock of some proposals and their predicament, 21 months on...

 Recast penal provisions

 Plan: Traffic penalties under different sections of the Motor Vehicles Act to be raised to act as a deterrent. In most cases, the proposed hike was at least five times the existing amount.

 Responsibility: The transport department.

 Status report: No change. Rash bus drivers still need to pay just Rs 400 for excessive speeding.

 Officialspeak: It is not for the transport department alone to act on this proposal. Since there has to be a parity in the fine structure across the country, we have forwarded the proposal to the Union government, says transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.

 Rationalise bus routes

 Plan: Given the number of private buses plying on one route, at least 12 routes need to be rationalised. This would curb competition and racing among drivers.

 Responsibility: Offices of the different regional transport authorities, under the department of transport, to take stock of the number of buses plying and act accordingly.

 Status report: No action.

 Copspeak: Despite our proposal, there has been no effort to rationalise the number of buses plying on a specific route, says Ranvir Kumar, the joint commissioner of police (traffic).

 Fix stands for autos

 Plan: Clearly marked auto stands to stop the practice of makeshift stands close to crossroads. For example, the Park Circus seven-point crossing is clogged by autos plying on seven routes.

 Responsibility: The public vehicles department (PVD).

 Status report: No action.

 PVDspeak: The ground reality is that the auto unions decide where the stand will be. There is not much we can do, admits a senior PVD official.

 No new fee-parking lots

 Plan: That would leave more room for bus bays and ensure better traffic management.

 Responsibility: The Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

 Status report: Parking lots are being added, allege the police.

 CMCspeak: The Corporation does not act on its own. The police are taken into confidence when parking lots are added, counters mayoral council member Faiyaz Ahmed Khan.

 Build parallel bridges

 Plan: At Beleghata, Maniktala and Narkeldanga Main Road.

 Responsibility: CMDA.

 Status report: No action.

 CMDAspeak: I am not sure about it; well have to check, says Debdas Bhattacharya, the chief engineer, traffic and transportation.

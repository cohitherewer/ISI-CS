 Third Nokia battery blast in three weeks

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Another Nokia BL-5C battery exploded on Tuesday, while the owner of the phone, a B.Com honours student, was at tuition. There was no injury. 

 The battery burst 10 minutes after Arnab Roy Chowdhury, of Dinabandhu Andrews College, received a call on the Nokia 1600 phone and kept it on the table. The boy from Kali Bajar, in Sonarpur, was at his mathematics teachers place at Rabindranagar, in Jadavpur. 

 This is the third Nokia battery explosion in the city in the past 21 days. 

 The handset was bought two years ago from a Nokia-authorised shop in Garia, said Arnabs father Pranab. We have the cash memo. But we will not lodge a police complaint as there was no injury. 

 Nokia had issued an advisory on August 14 stating that a series of its batteries was prone to overheating. The company is also replacing the defective batteries. 

 Arnab had visited a Nokia Care shop to get his battery checked a couple of days after the advisory was issued, but came back without getting a verdict as there was a long queue at the shop. 

 A Nokia spokesperson said on Wednesday that the company had got in touch with the customer and collected the damaged handset.

 The companys internal investigation has revealed that the BLD-3 battery in homemaker Kishori Sahas phone, that exploded on August 29, was a fake.

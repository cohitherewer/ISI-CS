 CM convoy sergeant in road mishap

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A traffic sergeant following the chief ministers convoy was injured after he rammed his two-wheeler into a stationary police jeep at the crossing of Park Street and Wood Street on Friday morning.

 The sergeant, Gopal Roy, was taken to SSKM Hospital and later shifted to CMRI. 

 The mishap did not disrupt the movement of the convoy, on its way from the CPM state headquarters on Alimuddin Street to Writers Buildings.

 On Thursday, a car carrying a state government official came in front of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees convoy while it was entering the state secretariat.

 Roy lost control of his vehicle after the front wheel skidded and hit the jeep. He was thrown off the motorcycle, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 An officer at the Lalbazar headquarters denied that the mishap was a security breach, saying it was just an accident. Asked whether action would be taken against Roy, he said: We will conduct a probe and take action accordingly.

 Ali Larter (picture right) stars as Niki Sanders in Heroes, which debuts on STAR World at 9 pm on Wednesday. Heres what Ali has to say about the series, which tells the story of several people who thought they were like everyone else... until they woke up with incredible abilities. 

 When you were first starting to know the character you are playing (Niki Sanders), what was your take on her?

 Well for me, I mean especially when I read the pilot, I didnt actually know what direction my character was going in, other than the fact that youve got a really complicated woman whos just trying to get by; shes trying to be a great mother to her son and her worlds really crumbling around her. So, for me, it wasnt about what kind of power she was getting or that; it was just about her dealing with her life and wondering if shes going crazy and whats happening to her. 

 What power would you have if you were a superhero?

 I would fly, I would fly, I would fly. Id love to soar. For me, I think that would the greatest way to experience freedom, and I think that would be incredible. 

 What made you want to make the transition from TV to movies and vice versa?

 I look for great writing. And, you know, for me, I mean when I read this pilot that Tim (Kring) wrote, its just incredible and, you know, there arent always so many great roles for women, and Niki Sanders is so interesting and she challenges me and pushes me. And so, Im just, you know, thrilled to have found a character that I feel like I can really grow best. 

 How would you react if we say superpower is being hot?

 Thank you! 

 Do you think something like beauty can be a weapon too?

 I think that my alter-ego definitely uses what shes got to get what she wants.

 What is it like playing a mother? Whats it like working so much with Noah (Gray-Cabey, who plays the son)?

 Noahs incredible. He makes my job easy. And honestly, watching his relationship with his mother has been a huge inspiration for me. Shes so open and so giving and, you know, we really discuss kind of the scenes before and hang out whenever we have a chance. And just kind of watching them, they have an incredible connection. So me and Noah use as much as we can from, you know, to inspire us within our roles. 

 I think that, as a woman, theres a side in all of us that really has this desire and this need to protect a child... watching my nephews theres definitely that side within me that would do anything to protect them. So I understand that. And, you know, Ive just been around kids my whole life. So it really hasnt been a struggle for me at all. Its been a natural kind of transition and I just think its a really interesting, unique relationship. 

 What do you think about working in a comic books series?

 For me, its really more of a human drama. Theres definitely all elements within the show, but it doesnt change the way I work. I work and always come from a place of reality. And I think that were lucky also to have some amazing directors come in and, you know, make some shots that really can lean that way.

 Did you follow any comic books when you were growing up? Or is this all new to you?

 This is all new to me and so its really fun.

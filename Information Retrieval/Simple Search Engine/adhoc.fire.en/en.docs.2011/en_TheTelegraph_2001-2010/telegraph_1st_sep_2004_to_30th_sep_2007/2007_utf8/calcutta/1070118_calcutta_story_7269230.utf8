 Funds hurdle for orphan swimmer

 - Second chance to cross channel

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Manik Chandra Mondal: Against the tide?

 Few swimmers get a shot at crossing the English Channel. Manik Chandra Mondal got the opportunity on consecutive years. 

 But like last year, his financial condition is threatening to become an insurmountable obstacle to the fulfilment of his dream. Manik, though, is not giving up yet. 

 The Channel Swimming Club has accepted the application by the orphan registered with the state government, seeking permission to represent India in the swim across 21 nautical miles, between Dover, in England, and Calais, in France. The event will be held on July 9. 

 Manik, 28, may miss out because participation involves expenditure far beyond his means.

 If swimming was the only criterion, nobody could have stopped me. But travelling abroad, staying there and paying the pilot will cost over Rs 5 lakh. I have only been able to arrange for Rs 1 lakh, says the swimmer.

 He shifted base from his native place in Midnapore to Dumurjala, in Howrah. He practises thrice a week in Bakkhali. On the other four days, he swims in the Hooghly. 

 Disappointment on the verge of success is not new to Manik. He had the opportunity to take part in the Channel swim in 2006, but could not make it after failing to arrange for funds.

 As soon as I got the green light from the Channel Swimming Club last year, I started applying for sponsorships. The State Bank of India granted me Rs 50,000. The government also agreed to provide Rs 50,000, but it came a bit too late. I was denied a visa by the British deputy high commission because one has to train in the cold water for at least 15 days before the swim, says Manik. 

 In 1986, Maniks mother put him in a state-aided orphanage, where he stayed for 10 years. He learnt swimming in the orphanage pond.

 In 1994, he participated in the All Bengal River Swimming Competition in the Shilabati river. He covered a distance of 10 km in 1 hour, 24 minutes and 10 seconds. Impressed, an officer of the Sports Authority of India took him to Maharashtra for training. 

 I realised then that I had a future in swimming. My biggest success so far has been swimming five km in the Arabian Sea in 53 minutes and 58 seconds. I was awarded a special prize because I am an orphan, says Manik. 

 His well-wishers advised him to apply to the Channel Swimming Association, which he did for the first time in 2006. His financial condition, however, put paid to his hopes.

 Garia arrest

 Sudhangshu Byapari, 34, was arrested at Ashoke Nagar, on the citys northern fringes, for his alleged involvement in the dacoity at Indrani Gangopadhyays home, off Garia Station Road, on Saturday night. The teacher had fought the dacoits, who had slashed her fingers with a chopper.

 Police said Byapari was picked up from his home on Tuesday. We will conduct a test identification parade once Indrani recovers, said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas).

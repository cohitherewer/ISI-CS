 What: International Evening 2007 at Calcutta Club.

 When: January 20.

 Big bash: With The Telegraph as one of the sponsors, the Calcutta Club played host to International Evening, one of the first events of the clubs centenary year, with the theme 100 Years and Beyond. The stage, set with motifs of universal brotherhood and religious tolerance, hosted performances by Kathak exponent Chitresh Das and tap dance maestro Jason Samuels Smith, a fusion that reiterated the theme of global harmony. Cocktail jugglery and a performance by Tidal Wave, which belted out classic and contemporary tracks, rocked the audience.

 A replica of a London tipplers delight also made its debut, with Calcutta Clubs version of Blind Beggars Pub being inaugurated by liquor baron Vijay Mallya. Built on the lines of the popular London haunt by the same name, the watering hole promises to serve members a slice of traditional British pub cuisine.

 The audience also took a stroll through history laced with liberal doses of nostalgia as industrialists B.K. Birla and R.P. Goenka recounted highlights of their association with the club.

 Big bite: Delectable international cuisine from around 20 countries and flowing spirits made the evening a memorable one. Savouries such as Tuna Steak (Scandinavia) and Kranier sausages (Austria) and sweets such as gooey gelato and chocolate mousse, took foodies on a gastronomic trip round the world.

 Voiceover: The theme marks the breaking of the barriers of nationality, caste, creed, colour, gender. The promotion of peace is mandatory in this era of violence. Next year, the underlying theme for our International Evening will be the restoration of the heritage of the club, said Dipak Mukherjee, club president. Food is one of the unifying factors, dissolving all boundaries, distinctions and discriminations, he added.

 Hot hunt

 What: The Unish Kuri Treasure Hunt. 

 When: January 20.

 Where: Across the city, ending at the ABP office.

 Crack the code: The first city-wide treasure hunt organised by Unish Kuri magazine for its club members.

 Eight cryptic clues about the city took the 34 participating teams to Shahid Minar, then to National Library, Sanskrit College, Star Theatre, Netaji Bhavan, Nabin Chandra Das sweet shop and finally the Unish Kuri office, where the prizes were given away. 

 The law students seemed to have had the most luck on Saturday. The first prize of Rs 15,000 went to Debanjali Chatterjee, a third-year law student and partner Rudraksha Sen, a B.Com student, while runners-up Ritom Sengupta, another law student and Abhijit Kunda, a post-graduate media studies student, bagged Rs 10,000. The team that came in third, Debolina Dey and Basumitra Dey, both law students, took home Rs 5,000.

 The prizes were handed over by Arindom, otherwise known as Vicky (the young winner of Unish Kuris Modhur Kantha contest last December), lead singer of Bangla band Fossils, Roopam Islam, and actress Rhimjhim Mitra. 

 Voiceover: Events like this are challenging and educational, and a brand like Unish Kuri can think of such innovative ideas for youngsters, said Arindom, while Roopam felt the days fun was inspiring and Rhimjhim encouraging.

 Prune palate

 What: Live cooking demo with California prunes by Sanjeev Kapoor.

 Where: The Park.

 When: January 19.

 Cook it up: Master chef Sanjeev Kapoor rustled up a number of dishes using prunes, the new-age dried fruit and a delicious summer offering, in creative ways to suit local taste buds. Prunes are a special variety of dried plums that are rich in fibre, high in sorbitol, low on fat and cholesterol a definite turn-on for fitness conscious folks and those with diabetes. 

 The event was organised by California Prune Board in association with FICCI Ladies Organisation. Prune kebabs, koftas, salads and pulaos Kapoor demonstrated just how versatile the fruit could be. Desserts too could be given a novel twist with the rich natural product. Stuffed Prunes Dipped in Melted Chocolate, Prune Kulfi and Cake are a few of the recommended variations on old sweet stalwarts.

 Voiceover: Dried fruits have always been favourites with Indians, and prunes definitely are the latest addition. You can add them as a breakfast topping or even to rice, pulao or biryanis... The moist, nice taste clubbed with health benefits make them a must-have for everyone, explains Kapoor, who stirred up an Apple and Prune Chutney and Royal Hara Bhara Prune Kebab during the demonstration.

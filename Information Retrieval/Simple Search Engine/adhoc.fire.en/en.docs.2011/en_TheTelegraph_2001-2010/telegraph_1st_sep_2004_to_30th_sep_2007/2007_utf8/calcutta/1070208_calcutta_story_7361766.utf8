The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Gizmos give betting the edge

 - CRICKET BOOKIES GO HI-TECH TO HOODWINK POLICE

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Huddled in a room in central Calcutta, a small group converses non-stop on cellphones while working on laptops.

 Suddenly, one in the group barks out some instructions and everyone starts packing up. They, however, make it a point to transfer the data in their laptops to a pen-drive before fleeing. A couple of hours later, the same set of people meets at another location and does the same work.

 Welcome to cricket betting in Calcutta, in top gear on the eve of the India-Sri Lanka one-dayer. The police chief donning the cap of the Cricket Association of Bengal boss has not deterred the bookies from making most of the cricket fever the city is in grip of.

 And to confuse the cops who are supposed to be on their trail, the bookmakers have given themselves a technological edge. Out go Burrabazar gaddis, enter plush rooms in star hotels or guest houses; out go chaupaniyas (rough paper pads), in come pen-drives.

 Technology has, indeed, given us an edge over the cops. Some of the new gadgets help us conduct our business without leaving any trail that can be used against us, said a bookie.

 An officer of the detective department agreed. When there were no mobile phones, laptops or pen-drives and the bookies would stay put at a place for hours to run their business, it was much easier to nab them. Today, thanks to the technology in their possession, they are always a step ahead of us, is the officers candid confession.

 The bookie who boasts four cellphones, a laptop and a pen-drive is expecting bets of around Rs 1.5 crore on Thursday. A day before the match, the odds were stacked highly in favour of India, with 60 paise against Sri Lanka at Rs 1.50. The odds for individual performances will be given out as the match progresses.

 According to their strategy, the bookies start taking the bets two hours before the match starts. This is also when they give out the odds on match results. The bets are recorded in the laptop. After a couple of hours, they move on to another destination with all their data safe in their laptops and pen-drives.

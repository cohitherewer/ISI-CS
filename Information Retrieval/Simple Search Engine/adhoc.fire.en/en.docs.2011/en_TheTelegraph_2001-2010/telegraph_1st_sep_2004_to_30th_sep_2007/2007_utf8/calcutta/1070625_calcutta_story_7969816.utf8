The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 SE Asia is Puja tour draw

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A boat ride down the backwaters of Kerala, though still popular, will face stiff competition this Puja from tourist destinations abroad.

 With airlines set to introduce cheaper tour packages and slashing airfares, a large number of tourists from the East are planning to visit Southeast Asian destinations, claim tour operators in the city. 

 Much ahead of the Puja, queries have started pouring in. Tour operators feel Singapore, Bangkok and Malaysia will be the most favourite destinations this autumn. 

 The trend suggests a 20 per cent rise in the count of tourists to southeast Asian destinations over last year. Earlier, this section of tourists preferred to travel within the country, said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India.

 Punjabi stressed that cheaper tour packages, better connectivity and lenient visa rules are the key reasons for the rise in traffic. 

 He added that the low-cost airlines, which will start operating by this year, will make travelling to southeast Asian destinations more affordable. 

 Air-India has almost finalised its plans to start operating its low-cost airline from Calcutta to Southeast Asia within a few months. We are set to launch Air-India Express before Puja 2007. The market is growing fast and there is a good demand from all categories of travellers, said A.K. Tirkey, commercial manager, eastern India, of Air-India. The airfares are being worked out, which would be much cheaper than regular fares. 

 Singapore-based Tiger airline has also announced plans to start operations from the city shortly. 

 Singapore Tourism Board (STB) will come up with special Puja packages. We have discussed the plans with various tour operators in the city. The deal will be finalised soon, says Kenneth Lim, area director, northern and eastern India, of STB.

 The tourist attractions at Singapore and Sentosa Island are being upgraded. The programmes will include a laser show in the sea, feeding Lory birds at Jurong Bird Park and a night safari in Singapore zoo. Malls in Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia are also being beautified to draw tourists, claims Lim.

 Three officials of Vishal Mega Mart, located in Baguiati off VIP Road, were arrested on Thursday evening and slapped with charges of selling fake products, forgery and cheating.

 Police said the Mega Mart was selling fake VIP suitcases for the past few months.

 Floor manager Abhijit Dey, computer operator Umesh Sharma and store manager Chandrajit Dey were arrested, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 A three-member team from VIP Industries and Blow Plast, manufacturers and distributors of VIP suitcases and bags, had gone to Baguiati police station claiming they had definite information about fake products being sold from the Mega Mart bearing their registered brand name and logo. In their complaint, they alleged that their registered brand name and logo was being used without permission and duplicate suitcases of inferior quality were being sold.

 A team was formed and Vishal Mega Mart was raided around 6.30 pm, along with the three complainants. After forcing their way in, police conducted a search. In the section stocking suitcases and travel accessories, the three complainants spotted at least 20 products bearing the VIP logo, which they said were not originals. These were seized.

 An alert has been sounded in the city and its adjoining areas where Vishal Mega Mart outlets are located to check for sale of fake VIP luggage.

 We are coordinating with Calcutta Police to get in touch with the owners of Vishal Mega Mart, who are not in town at the moment, said an officer. We will ascertain how the fakes were being branded and sold, and trace those associated with this fraud, he added.

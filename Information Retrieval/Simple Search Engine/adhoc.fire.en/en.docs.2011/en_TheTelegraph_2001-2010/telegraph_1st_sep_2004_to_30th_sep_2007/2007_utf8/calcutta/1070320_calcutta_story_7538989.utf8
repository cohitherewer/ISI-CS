The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 21-day deadline for township list of plot transfers

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court has given three weeks to the state government to file a report on the number of plots illegally transferred in Salt Lake.

 The state urban development department is directed to find out how many plots have been transferred illegally in Salt Lake, said the division bench of Justice P.K. Ghosh and Justice Biswanath Somadder, setting a three-week deadline for the exercise.

 The division bench passed the order while hearing a petition, filed by Bidhannagar Bachao Committee, a residents organisation.

 According to the petition, leased land was being illegally transferred in Salt Lake as the lessees were selling their plots to outsiders. A list of plot-holders, who had handed over their space to outsiders, was appended with the petition. 

 Moved in January 2006, the petition had also complained that the state government which had leased out the land was aware of the malpractice, but had not taken any action against the offenders.

 Salt Lake Land Distribution Act, drawn up after creating the township, does not allow transfer of properties as plot-holders are lessees of the land for 99 years and have no right to hand these over to any outsider.

 But some of the plot-holders have been transferring the right of land through various means like making false wills, the petitioners had highlighted.

 In May 2006, a division bench of Calcutta High Court had asked the government to state whether it had any information on illegal transfer of plots in Salt Lake and wanted to know about the steps it had taken against the offenders.

 The state urban development department filed a report before the high court on October 3, 2006, and said that it had received several complaints on illegal transfer of land in the township. The court was also informed that a committee had been set up to find out the number of illegally-transferred plots.

 But when the matter came up for hearing on Monday, the petitioners counsel, Rama Prasad Sarkar, alleged that illegal transfer of plots in Salt Lake had not stopped as the government has not taken any steps. The petitioners also alleged that entry of outsiders in Salt Lake had vitiated the atmosphere and made the township more unsafe.

 Some plot-holders are allowing promoters to make illegal constructions on their plots, which is a violation of an earlier court order, added Sarkar. The matter will come up for hearing after three weeks.

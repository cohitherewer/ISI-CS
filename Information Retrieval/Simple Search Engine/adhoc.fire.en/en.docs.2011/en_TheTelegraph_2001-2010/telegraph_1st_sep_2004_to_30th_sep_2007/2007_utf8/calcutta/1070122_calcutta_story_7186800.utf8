 Farzan loves Bharti.

 Our love is immortal Avisek + Mohuya

 Santu from KGP 

 These messages, fit for a classified column, adorn centuries-old skeletons that occupy pride of place in the zoological gallery of the Indian Museum. 

 Showing no concern for the precious remains, Farzan has expressed his love for Bharti on the seventh rib of the Hook-Lipped Rhinoceros and Avisek has immortalised his love for Mohuya on the tusk of an Indian Elephant. 

 Messages, symbols and signatures cover the skeletons of Indian Pilot Whale and the skull of Little Piked Whale, two of the other attractions in the gallery. 

 The defacement of the skeletons indicate the state of affairs, says a senior official. 

 The ninth biggest museum in the world and the largest in the Asia-Pacific region also boasts galleries on insects, Egypt, archaeology, coins, reptiles and birds, and amphibians.

 Over half the museum is out of bounds for visitors. Many of the exhibits in the parts open to the public are defaced with messages. 

 It is sad to see a large number of rare, valuable and interesting exhibits damaged in this manner. Many of the mounted specimens, skeletons, casts and models have been procured from across the globe, rues another museum official. 

 According to him, scribbling on the skeletons in the zoological gallery is easy because most of them are too big to be put inside showcases. 

 In the other galleries, the artefacts and the models are kept in showcases Our problem is, we do not have enough people for surveillance. Besides, we do not have closed-circuit televisions in the gallery, explains the official. 

 Defacement is just one of the problems plaguing the museum, which boasts Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi as its chairman. Lack of attention to cleanliness and maintenance, differences between management and the workers union and absence of surveillance have robbed the glory off the historic institution on Jawaharlal Nehru Road. 

 The museum is also plagued by the absence of a full-time director. Chittaranjan Panda, curator of the Victoria Memorial, is heading the institution on a temporary basis. 

 The maintenance staff had some differences with the management, but those have been resolved and the museum is now cleaned regularly. Some galleries are closed because they are under construction, says Panda, swatting away the mismanagement slur. 

 A fall in the footfall count at the museum indicates that interest in the museum is waning. According to officials, the institution attracts a footfall of over 1,000 on an average day. The numbers swell on weekends and holidays. 

 The foreigners make it a point to visit the museum But given the state of affairs, they go back with wrong impression, states a senior museum official, demanding measures by the authorities to effect a turnaround.

 What: 59th anniversary celebrations of the Independence Day of the Union of Myanmar.

 Where: Rosewood Hall at The Park.

 When: Friday evening, 7.30 pm onwards.

 Take a look: There was Myanmar magic everywhere in the Rosewood Hall. While paintings, figurines and handicrafts lined the aisles, a large screen treated the audience to stunning landscapes and dances of Myanmar. A conventional Myanmar harp looked beautiful.

 aborate flower arrangements and candles created an ambience soft and warm. And some of the guests were in traditional Myanmar ensembles.

 After hosts U. Soe Paing (consul general of Myanmar) and his wife welcomed the guests, the Myanmar national anthem was played, followed by Jana gana mana.

 Also spotted: Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, Italian consul general Agostino Pinna, Gobind Prasad Kusum, consul general of Nepal, Muhammad Imran, Deputy High Commissioner of Bangladesh, Vladimir Lazarov, Russian consul general, and other dignitaries. 

 Sip bite: The sumptuous food spread was not devoid of the Myanmar flavour. Wine and juice flowed freely. Finger food like Fish Cake, Chicken Satay and Thai Corn Cake kept the guests busy. The main course was all about Plasam Rod (fish in chilli sauce), Kuey Fried Kremano (fried egg noodles with herbs), Ohnnoh Khauk Swe (coconut noodles) and more.

 Voiceover: We have tried to create a Myanmar ambience. We might be away from Myanmar, but Calcutta as a city is warm and cordial. This feels like home away from home, smiled U. Soe Paing.

 Easy appeal

 What: A fashion show to launch Easy Stretch Collection from the Park Avenue stable, in association with US brand Lycra.

 Six months from now, passengers stepping out of Howrah station will get an unobstructed view of the Hooghly.

 A high court-appointed panel monitoring river pollution has ordered removal of all eateries on the river bank, opposite Howrah station, by that time.

 The eateries are not only blocking the view of the river but are also adding significantly to its pollution.

 The committee decided on the removal of the eateries at a meeting in Paribesh Bhavan, in Salt Lake, on Thursday.

 We have ordered the shifting of nine hotels from the river bank. The Howrah Municipal Corporation has been asked to identify a site where the eateries will be relocated, said M.L. Meena, the environment secretary and chairman of the committee.

 The eateries are being run illegally, as the civic body has not renewed their trade licences after 2005. The eateries, catering to thousands daily, produce huge amounts of waste that is discharged in the river, alleged environment activist Subhas Dutta.

 Sources said the panel also decided to file an affidavit against Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), which has allegedly disowned its responsibility to fight pollution of the river.

 The CPT has informed us that it is only concerned with port-related activities and navigability of the river, and is not responsible for preventing pollution. At the same time, it has admitted to renting out parts of the banks to 100-odd agencies, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the member-convener of the panel.

 The committee also decided to consider setting up an effluent treatment plant for the 1,000-odd dyeing and bleaching units in Mahestala, on the southern fringes of the city.

 About the proposed Hooghly River Management Authority, environment secretary Meena said it would start functioning once the legal remembrance cell gives its go-ahead.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Monitor cell on belchers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The government has, for once, kept its promise to step on the gas in the race against air pollution.

 A week after Metro blew the lid off faulty and farcical tailpipe tests in town, the state transport department on Tuesday announced a series of measures to clear the air about pollution-under-control (PUC) certificates.

 The crackdown on automobile emission centres includes the opening of a control room at the public vehicles department (PVD) in Beltala.

 Anyone who wishes to complain about any vehicle belching smoke can call up 9433029570 or 24864210 and give the number. We will track it down and take penal action, promised transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.

 Also, state pollution control board officials and PVD inspectors will conduct surprise checks on the functioning of auto emission testing centres. Licences of rogue centres will be cancelled.

 The transport department is inviting expressions of interest for mobile vans fitted with auto emission testing machines. Once the number of mobile centres goes up, it will be easier to cancel the licences of errant centres, said an official.

 Advertisements will be placed in newspapers to raise awareness about the rule for PUC certification by an authorised testing centre and the penal action for flouting it.

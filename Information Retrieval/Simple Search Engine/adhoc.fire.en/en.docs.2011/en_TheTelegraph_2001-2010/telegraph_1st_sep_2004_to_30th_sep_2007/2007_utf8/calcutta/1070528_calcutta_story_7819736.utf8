The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Roaming on landline sets

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta Telephones has introduced roaming facilities on landline sets. 

 Any Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) or Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) landline in India can be used to avail of the service.

 Those who want to activate roaming will be assigned an 11-digit code. It has to be dialled from the chosen phone, outside the city, to register it for the service.

 Calls made to the subscribers landline will be forwarded to the registered phone. It can also be used for making calls.

 For example, an MTNL phone in Mumbai can be used to receive calls made to a BSNL phone in Calcutta. The subscriber can also make calls from the Mumbai phone.

 A subscriber on roaming has to pay charges for receiving calls. But if he makes a call within the city he is visiting using the registered phone, it will be treated as a local call.

 Up to eight landline sets can be registered for the roaming service for each trip. A subscriber can draw up a call routing plan in advance.

 A subscriber can choose to receive calls from Calcutta but not from Mumbai while on roaming. He or she can also choose to receive calls during working hours and not after that and on weekends and holidays, explained Calcutta Telephones spokesperson Salil Kumar Bhaduri.

 It is also possible to restrict calls originating from BBD Bag while allowing calls from the rest of Calcutta, added Bhaduri.

 Calcutta Telephones will add the charges incurred while the roaming service is activated to the regular telephone bill of the subscriber. Those availing of the facility will not have to spend anything on phone calls while travelling, pointed out Bhaduri.

 An intelligent network will allow a subscriber to use the 11-digit code, known as Universal Access Number, to register more than one telephone. The number will be in the form 1901345xxxx, with the last four digits being unique to the subscriber.

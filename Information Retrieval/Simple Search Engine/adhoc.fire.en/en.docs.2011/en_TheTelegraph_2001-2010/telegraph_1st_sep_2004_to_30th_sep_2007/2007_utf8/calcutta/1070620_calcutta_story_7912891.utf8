 Malls may be the order of the day but New Market and its surroundings remain a prime draw for traders and customers. So much so that property price in the area has hit an all-time high.

 A 150-sq-ft shop on Bertram Street, near the market, recently changed hands for Rs 90 lakh. Nishant Alam, who bought the store, however, has not confirmed the price tag. 

 Such under-the-counter payments, known as pagri, are regularly made when shops and flats change hands in central Calcutta. But it is never official.

 The middle-aged businessman, who deals in garments, could not conceal his pride at the mention of the record-breaking rate Rs 60,000 per sq ft he paid to a footwear store-owner. The shop, opposite Shree Ram Arcade, will break even in a couple of years, he says. 

 Around New Market, what matters is the location of a shop. If it is on the main road and offers a good display, it will attract a high price. The Bertram Street shop is close to a Metro Railway station, cinema halls and other shop stops.

 We import womens wear from Bangkok and China and supply them to shops in markets and malls across the city. With our product mix, we are sure of a turnover of Rs 20,000 per day, says Alam. 

 Over the years, Lindsay Street has become less of a thoroughfare and more of a high street shopping destination. There are more than 220 shops on the road, many of them not more than 100 sq ft. 

Unlike malls, the merchandise changes with the season at New Market, says a woman who has been shopping in the area for 25 years. New Market attracts about 50,000 people on an average day. The footfall goes up to lakhs during festivals.

 Those who own property in the area are trying to maximise profits. I rented this shop last year for Rs 8,000 per month. Now, the owner wants to sell off this less-than-100-sq-ft property for Rs 45 lakh, says a footwear trader on Lindsay Street.

 The rent for such shops has crossed Rs 12,000 per month. The hike is in sharp contrast to the rent inside the 125-year-old market. The rent ranged between Rs 400 and Rs 2,000 a month. The shops that are coming up now are costlier, says Hasibur Rahman, of Kids Korner inside New Market. 

 Citi Mart, earlier Lighthouse cinema, is the largest standalone apparel store in the area. We have a footfall of over 800 on weekends, says Mohammad Salahuddin, a floor manager at the store. 

 The Parkomat, finally completed, has made the area more attractive. Shoppers had turned their backs on New Market because of the parking problem. The Parkomat provides space for more than 250 cars, says Vikram Metharamani, who owns two shops in New Market. 

 Even the stores in the mall inside the Parkomat are almost sold out. The price is Rs 8,000 per sq ft, yet more than 80 per cent of the 200 shops have already been sold, says an official at the Parkomat.

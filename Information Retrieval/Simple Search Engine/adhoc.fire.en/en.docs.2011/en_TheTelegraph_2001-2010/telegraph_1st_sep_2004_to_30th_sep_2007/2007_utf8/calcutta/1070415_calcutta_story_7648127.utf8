 Its called Calcutta Police Live and its not another helpline that doesnt work. Its the orchestra-cum-band of the city force. 

 One of its stars is Prashanta Tamang, 25, who joined Special Action Force, a wing of the city police, as a constable in 2002. Last month he was selected for Indian Idol.

 I love singing and to be selected for Indian Idol from the eastern region is terrific, he blushes. 

 Formed eight months ago, the 17-member group comprises trained musicians from the two Calcutta Police bands -pipe and brass -- and from other wings of the force. The brass band is the oldest police band in the country. But the response to the latest band has been phenomenal. It is a major crowd-puller.

 The city police is the first in the country to have an orchestra-band of its own. We are flooded with requests, says joint commissioner (armed police) Zulfikar Hasan.

 We performed at 20 places during Durga Puja last year and the crowds loved it. Initially everyone was surprised that those who run after criminals can also entertain people, gushes Tamang. We performed mostly at police housing complexes and in some neighbourhoods in Salt Lake. It was mind-blowing, adds guitarist Sudipto Das.

 The band, which includes trained guitarists, drummers and three vocalists who can sing in Hindi, Bengali, Nepali and English, also performs at several schools, in and around the city. They have performed at several programmes organised by NGOs working with street children. We do not charge anything for such programmes, says Hasan.

 Tamang is a versatile man. His repertoire includes Hindi chartbusters, as well as English songs. Latest Hindi songs are a craze these days, says Tamang. That doesnt mean Shakira is out. Recently I sang Hips Dont Lie. We got a tremendous response at a show in Ballygunge. All members of the orchestra are very happy, says Tamang. 

 Das, the guitarist, is overjoyed too. He was an old hand on the instrument when he joined the force as a constable. 

 Playing guitar was my passion. I used to play it at para functions and other programmes. Now I am delighted to be part of the orchestra, said Das, attached to Shakespeare Sarani police station. 

 The response to the band has spurred the think-tank into expansion plans. Considering the popularity we are going to form another orchestra. The best of the policemen will be selected for the new team, says Hasan.

 The new orchestra will be housed at the BT Road police barracks. The pipe and brass bands have their address at Bodyguard Lines, the Calcutta Armed Police headquarters in Alipore. 

 The rest of the force looks indulgently on their talented artistes in the orchestra. The musicians, though they were recruited for active duty, are allowed exemption from duty. 

 I had requested my superiors to allow me to be part of it when the orchestra was being formed. I had to appear at a test, which I cleared. I am now doing what I do best, says Tamang.

 According to police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, the orchestra was formed to add a new dimension to the older bands. 

 Percussionist Tanmay Bose, who was recently roped in by senior officers to train the group, was all praise for the cop-musicians. The whole bunch is very talented. It was my pleasure to train them, Bose said. 

 Joint commissioner Hasan proudly recalls how Calcutta Police began its association with music. On November 1, 1858, a group of Englishmen was hurriedly summoned to play at the Governors house on the occasion of the transfer of power from East India Company to the British Crown. Later, these musicians were recruited by the force to form the police band.

 Rash motorcyclist stopped, thrashed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two days after rash driving by a South Point school student landed three girls in hospital, a 26-year-old man, on a two-wheeler, repeated the crime of rash driving in front of a girls school on Lord Sinha Road on Friday afternoon. 

 Though on-duty traffic sergeant R.K. Dutta intercepted Asif Ahmed, the incident took a different turn, leaving the cops red-faced. The sergeant exceeded his brief and thrashed the mechanic of a local garage in full public glare. 

 Asif, who had to be hospitalised following the tough treatment meted out by the sergeant, later filed a complaint with Bhowanipore police station. 

 Dutta also lodged a counter-complaint, saying Asif was trying to flee after pushing him. 

 We are investigating the matter A rash driving case has been registered against Asif, but we are also trying to verify the officers complaint, said Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 According to police, Asif was speeding through the crowded Lord Sinha Road around 2 pm and had almost hit a student of a reputed girls school while she was crossing the road. 

 Spotting Asif speeding dangerously through the road and scaring the schoolgirls and other pedestrians, Dutta followed him and intercepted him on Lee Road. 

 When Dutta asked him to produce his licence, Ahmed refused and started arguing with the officer. 

 It might have led Dutta to lose his cool. He then instructed Asif to accompany him to the police station. But the youth was not ready to do so, said an officer of Bhowanipore police station.

 Trouble broke out when Dutta grabbed Asifs hands and a scuffle followed. Infuriated, Dutta first slapped Ahmed and then thrashed him till the youth slumped to the road and people started gathering around the Lee Road crossing. 

 Bystanders rushed Asif, who had received injuries on his nose and face, to Sambhunath Pandit Hospital, from where he was discharged after a few hours.

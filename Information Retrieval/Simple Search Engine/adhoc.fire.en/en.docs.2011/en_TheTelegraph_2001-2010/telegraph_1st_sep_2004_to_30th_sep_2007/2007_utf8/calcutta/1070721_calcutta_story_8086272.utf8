 Man beaten up, wife roughed up 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Nanigopal Pal, in his early 50s, was allegedly beaten up by his neighbour Golapjhar Dubey for protesting the latter abusing and roughing up his wife on Wednesday morning. 

 Pal lodged a complaint with Posta thana on Friday. According to the cops, Dubey objected to Pals wife washing utensils on the balcony of their second-floor rented flat near the police station.

 Dubey allegedly threw the utensils away, before pushing the woman. On hearing the din, Pal came out of his room, when Dubey and four accomplices beat him up with lathis.

 Policemen from Posta thana picked up Pal, Dubey and his accomplices.

 But a group of men, said to be CPM cadres, came to the police station and freed Dubey and the rest, saying the dispute would be sorted out after a meeting in the local party office, Pal said in his complaint.

 He got himself treated at Medical College and Hospital, and armed with the doctors report, went to the police station to lodge the complaint. No arrest has been made so far.

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Drunken driving claimed four lives in the city and Salt Lake during Doljatra revelry on Saturday. Around 1,250 people have been arrested for disorderly conduct.

 Motorcyclist Amal Das, 35, died after being knocked down by a Tata Sumo near Moore Avenue, in Tollygunge, on Saturday morning. The car hit six pedestrians, before ramming into the two-wheeler.

 Local residents chased the vehicle and got hold of the driver, Manas Majumdar, 30, who was later handed over to police.

 The injured were rushed to MR Bangur Hospital, from where Das and a pedestrian, Bhola Mitra, were shifted to National Medical College and Hospital. Das died there.

 Majumdar, returning from a friends house, was drunk. A case has been registered against him, said an officer of Tollygunge police station.

 In another mishap, a Tata Sumo hit four labourers in front of Nicco Park, in Salt Lake, around 4.30 pm, leaving two dead on the spot. Police said the labourers where on their way to New Town. 

 The deceased have been identified as R. Sylvian, 19, and G.N. Dharunidhi, 22, both from Tamil Nadu. The injured were admitted to NRS Medical College and Hospital.

 According to witnesses, some youths were drinking in the vehicle. They fled after the mishap, said an investigating officer.

 A 35-year-old motorcyclist was killed after the vehicle hit a parked truck in Budge Budge in the evening. Police said the motorcyclist was drunk.

 Deputy commissioner (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee said: Around 850 people were arrested on Saturday and 400 on Sunday across the city on charges of disorderly conduct. We had seized 82 motorcycles in the past couple of days.

 Tension ran high in Chitpur on Sunday afternoon, when two boys, aged 12 and 16, threw colour on the vehicle of deputy commissioner (reserve force) Dilip Bandopadhyay. No one was arrested.

 Trouble broke out in CA-CB blocks, Salt Lake, on Sunday morning, after residents complained against the use of microphones in a programme organised by a cultural trust. The residents alleged that the trust had violated the high court-imposed ban in view of the ongoing Madhyamik.

 Trust secretary S. Gupta claimed they had permission from the authorities, but police denied it. Biswajit Mukherjee, senior law officer in the environment department, said the matter would be probed.

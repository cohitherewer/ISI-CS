 Common room ransack

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A group of students of Jaipuria College, in north Calcutta, allegedly ransacked the common room of Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis College, at Dunlop. The students were caught cheating in their B.Com Part I examinations. 

 We are shocked that students of such a reputed college can engage in such acts of vandalism, said Swapan Kar, principal of the Dunlop college.

 The Jaipuria students broke an almirah, damaged a new table tennis board and the lights and fan in the common room, Kar alleged. 

 They were acting out of vengeance, as four of them were caught cheating while writing their Part I exams, said a teacher.

 Their answer scripts were seized and the students were asked to leave the examination hall, the teacher said. 

 We allowed them to keep their bags in our common room while they sat for their exams on the college buildings first floor. Admissions to the first year were going on in the ground floor, said the principal.

 The exams had started on June 6 and Monday was the last day of the Part I examinations of the university.

 Around 3.30pm, some of our students rushed into my office to inform that the Jaipuria students were out on the rampage. By the time we went downstairs, they had already left, he said.

 The college authorities informed the local police station at Baranagar but did not go for a formal complaint.

 As we couldnt catch those who wrecked the room red-handed, we preferred not to make any further ado about it, said the principal. Also, they are students, and we would not like them to be implicated in a police case.

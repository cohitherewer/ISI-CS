 Unorganised sector gains JU expertise

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jadavpur University (JU) has taken up a project for overall development of unorganised-sector units, at a time when workers in the sector have been demanding legislative steps for job security.

 As part of the project, JUs School of Bio-science and Engineering will identify the problems faced by the various unorganised-sector units in the city and elsewhere in the state and prepare a report on how best ailing units can be revamped.

 To start with, the university has selected 600 small units in South 24-Parganas, engaged in manufacturing surgical instruments.

 Most of these units do not have any quality-control expertise, lack proper technological support and function in the absence of accurate data on the demand of their products, said Parthapratim Biswas, a senior teacher and member of the universitys executive council. We will try to address these problems.

 The project, dealing with the 600 surgical instrument-manufacturing units, has been approved by the department of science and technology of the Centre, which has also agreed to provide funds.

 The School of Bio-Science and Engineering will carry out extensive research and develop technology that is ideal for these units.

 The first phase of work, involving identification of the problems faced by the units, has begun, said an official. 

 While interacting with the workers of the units, we have found that most of them lack a sound knowledge about the material they use for manufacturing the instruments. This results in production of poor-quality instruments, for which the units suffer, the official added.

 Apart from providing them with tips on the manufacturing process, our report will include suggestions on the kind of coating they should apply on the instruments to make them more effective, another official pointed out.

 One must keep in mind that the products have a market not just in Bengal but also in other parts of the country.

 The university has plans to take up similar projects for apparel-manufacturing units in Metiabruz and toy-making units across the city.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Talk table set for stock exchange site

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A tripartite process has been initiated to reach an out-of-court settlement of the civic bodys claim over a 10-acre plot, off EM Bypass, that it had leased out to Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE) 12 years ago.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) wants the plot back as the stock exchange has failed to relocate to the Bypass site, off ITC Sonar Bangla.

 The CSE has moved court against former municipal commissioner Debasis Soms order in 2004 that the plot be handed back to the civic body.

 As part of the move to amicably settle the issue which follows a dialogue between the chief minister and the mayor the principal secretary in the commerce and industry department, Sabyasachi Sen, called a meeting at Writers Buildings on Monday.

 Civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay and CSE representatives attended the meeting. I am hopeful that in the greater interest of the city, an out-of-court settlement will be reached, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 We immediately need at least five acres to finance the infrastructure development projects being taken up under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, the mayor added. The CMC plans to sell the land through open bidding.

 Brokers enlisted with the CSE are keen on an out-of-court settlement, but have come forward with a few conditions.

 They want five acres to be handed over to an agency like West Bengal Infrastructure development Corporation (WBIDC), which is in search of land on the Bypass for the proposed permanent fairground.

 Of the rest, the CMC can go for an open bidding, but 75 per cent of the proceeds must come to the CSE.

 The other proposal of the the brokers is that the government allot them a 10-acre plot in Rajarhat, in exchange of the Bypass site.

 The brokers terms have been forwarded to the CSE, said S.K. Kausik, a member of the empowered committee on demutualisation.

 If WBIDC gets five acres, it is likely to merge the plot with the Milon Mela ground, said an official. The total fair ground will then be 71 bighas, much bigger than the part of the Maidan where the Book Fair used to be held.

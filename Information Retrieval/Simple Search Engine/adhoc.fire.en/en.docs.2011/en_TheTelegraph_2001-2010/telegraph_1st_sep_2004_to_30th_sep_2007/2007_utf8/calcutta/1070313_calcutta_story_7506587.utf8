 Not only did the rally by the CPMs farmers wing maul the Maidan, it also violated the noise norms specified by the state government following directives from Calcutta High Court during Sundays show of strength at the Brigade Parade Grounds.

 Ignoring the guidelines, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees pro-industry speech reached the audience through 320 loudspeakers, connected to 20 amplifiers. 

 Though high court order and pollution control board (PCB) directive have made mandatory the use of a sound limiter to restrict sound level to around 65 decibel not a single sound limiter was found on the Maidan. 

 We did not use sound limiters with the amplifier at Sundays meeting, admitted Badal Gan of Mike Centre on Monday. 

 We are aware of the norms about sound limiters. But we did not use them as sound would not have properly circulated had we used the limiters, explained Gan. 

 In 1996, the high court directed that every microphone should be attached to a sound limiter to curb noise pollution. 

 To make the instrument readily available, state government agency Webel started manufacturing sound limiters. Then, the PCB and state government made the use of sound limiters, along with microphones, binding from 1997. 

 Initially, the enforcement was proper and a lot of violators were fined for not using sound limiters, said a PCB official. 

 But the pollution watchdog is shying away from commenting on noise norm violations during the Sunday rally. 

 We have no knowledge of the matter The primary responsibility of enforcing noise norms lies with police, said PCB member-secretary Debal Roy. He, however, added that the board will make an inquiry into the matter. 

 I have no idea about any violation, said Pradeep Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters). He, however, stressed that the permission for the rally was given on the understanding that the PCB norms would be followed. 

 But the green brigade has pointed out that the rally organisers did not follow the guidelines. 

 This is an extreme case of violation The administration failed to perform its duty and contain noise pollution, said environmental activist Subhas Dutta. I will take the matter to high court, he added. 

 The violation can be addressed under Environment Protection Act, 1986, under which violation can attract a fine up to Rs 1 lakh or imprisonment of up to five years. 

 But the organisers are pleading ignorance. We were not aware of the sound limiter guideline This is the responsibility of the sound system operators, said Samar Baora, secretary, Krishak Sabha.

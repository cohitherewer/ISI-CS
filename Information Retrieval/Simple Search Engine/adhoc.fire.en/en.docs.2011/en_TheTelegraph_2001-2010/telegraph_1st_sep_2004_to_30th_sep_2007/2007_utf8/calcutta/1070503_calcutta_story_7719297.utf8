 A swim in the rooftop pool, a session at the airport gym at a discounted rate, toys for children on board and executive class seats at economy class fares airlines, international and domestic, are rolling out special offers to attract passengers.

 Passengers demands have changed over the years. Besides competitive fares, they now look for special offers on board the flight or after reaching the destination, said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India.

 Singapore Airlines claims its passenger count has gone up since the launch of its Boarding Pass Privilege (BPP) programme. Under the scheme, discounts are offered at shops, restaurants, hotels and tourist attractions in Singapore. There are also discounts for fliers at the transit mall of Changi airport. In addition, there are special offers at the airports Oasis lounge, entertainment complex and Plaza Premium.

 The programme was promoted extensively in India. The response from Calcutta has been good, said Stephen Forshaw, vice-president (public affairs) of the airline.

 The airline is planning to offer similar facilities at Indian airports. By 2009, we expect to tie up with Indian companies for launching the BPP programme here, added Forshaw. 

 International and domestic carriers like Emirates, Thai Airways, British Airways, Jet and Kingfisher are offering toys and books to children on board. A child passenger is given a sky flier kit that consists of puzzles, colouring books, toy aircraft and books, said a British Airways official. 

 The national carrier, Indian, has also come up with a special offer. Under the scheme, called Premium Economy Fares, a passenger has to pay Rs 100 more than the economy class fare to get an executive class seat. 

 Another facility that Indian is going to launch is the Self Check-in Kiosk. The kiosk will soon be installed at Calcutta and other airports, said an Indian official.

 Sunil Bagarias brother cannot believe he possessed firearms and was picked up by the police for plotting a petrol pump robbery. 

 Sitting in the familys Sambhu Chatterjee Street flat, the young man an employee with a leading IT company is trying hard to cope with his brothers arrest. 

 We are not sure how Sunil landed up there with those people. Probably he wanted to chill out after a hard days work, mumbles Sunils elder brother, as he prepares to leave for Park Street police station to meet his brother.

 Sunil, along with nine others, was arrested at a Free School Street hotel on Wednesday night. Mohit Lundia, his distant relative and also from a business family, was in the gang, too. 

 We are a reputed family here and have a decades-old timber business. Mohit graduated in commerce and was into business We cant believe his association with criminals, says Mohits cousin, who lives in the familys ancestral Burtola Street home. 

 But according to police, the gang with a track record of rioting and extortion met at the bar before setting out to raid a Camac Street petrol pump. Businessman Deepak Agarwal, resident of Diamond Harbour Road, had allegedly hosted the get-together. 

 The arrest of these young men has come as a shock to the peace-loving business community in the Burrabazar area. 

 Direct involvement in such criminal activities was unheard of in our community But things are changing and most of these young boys are not interested in the family business and want a fast life, says businessman Hari Prakash Soni. 

 High-return business propositions like real estate, the stock market and betting are attracting the youth, as they are ready to take more risks, feel some old-timers. 

 While the arrests have come as a shock to many in the community, Prabha Khaitan, writer and industrialist, is not surprised. 

 The criminalisation of the business world is affecting the next generation They are getting more daring and taking much more drastic measures in search of easy money, sums up Khaitan.

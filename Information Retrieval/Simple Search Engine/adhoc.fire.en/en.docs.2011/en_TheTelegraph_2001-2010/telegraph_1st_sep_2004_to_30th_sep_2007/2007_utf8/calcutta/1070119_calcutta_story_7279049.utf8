 Rival burgles camera shop

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A shop-owner was arrested on Thursday for allegedly stealing more than 25 cameras from a shop in the New Market area.

 Police said Rafique Khan, 26, who frequented the outlet, and had used duplicate keys to open the shop and steal the cameras. 

 The robbery was detected on Thursday morning, when the shop-owner Ghulam Rasul Mallik opened his shop on Moti Sil Street and found all the cameras missing.

 How could the thieves enter and steal the cameras without breaking the locks? I am shocked, cried Mallik. 

 Police said during investigation, they didnt find any clue of professional burglary. It was very clear that some insider was involved in the crime. We interrogated the staff, but they were in the dark, said Hiren Chandra Das, officer-in-charge (OC) of New Market police station.

 The needle of suspicion shifted to Malliks close associates. And we hit upon Rafique, who runs a camera shop on Lenin Sarani and frequently visits Malliks outlet. He had an eye on the cameras, Das added. During interrogation, Rafique confessed to his crime. We have recovered some of the cameras. 

 According to police, a few days ago, Rafique had engaged professional key-makers for making duplicate keys. We are now trying to find out whether some worker or employee of Malliks shop is also involved in the crime, said OC Das.

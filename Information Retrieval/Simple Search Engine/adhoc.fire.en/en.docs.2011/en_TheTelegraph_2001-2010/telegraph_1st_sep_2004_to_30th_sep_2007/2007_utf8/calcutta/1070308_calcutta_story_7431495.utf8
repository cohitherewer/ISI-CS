The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rave turns rage, life goes on edge

 - Midnight parties of DJ beats, liquor free-flow and drug overdose

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 It is 9 in the morning but Sakshi (name changed), an air hostess, is still twirling to the tune of the psychedelic number that the DJ is belting out to a giddy group of young men and women.

 Besides popping Speed and Ecstasy like there is no tomorrow, these 20-somethings are rewriting the rules of fun in Calcutta, with rave parties at select haunts.

 Last week, police rounded up 280 revellers from a rave party in Pune and recovered seven bottles of phenylephrine hydrochloride, two-and-a-half kg of ganja, 100 g of hashish (charas) and other contraband.

 Calcutta is finally catching up with the trend of rave parties and the number of such dos is rising steadily, says a DJ who is a rage in the rave world.

 From the where to the when to the what, everything about rave parties is different from the routine get-togethers. The farmhouses and resorts, a short drive away from the city centre, are the perfect venues for raves. They come alive around midnight.

 The parties continue well into the morning... The musts for a rave party are ganja, hashish, amphetamines and Ecstasy, which are sold on the spot, explains a rave regular. After a normal dose of dance and drinks, the DJs roll out the drug roster for the night. High on these drugs, the party people can dance for hours, says the DJ.

 The spurt in rave parties can be linked to the influx of professionals from other metros, where the rave became a rage years before it was imported to Calcutta.

 The boom in the IT industry, the hospitality and aviation sectors have brought in a lot of cash-rich young people who like living on the edge, explains an insider.

 With the Pune party arrests hitting the headlines, the spotlight is once again on the role of the authorities in checking the rise of the rave.

 We try to keep a close watch on parties After the raid and arrests in Pune we have stepped up our vigil in the city, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

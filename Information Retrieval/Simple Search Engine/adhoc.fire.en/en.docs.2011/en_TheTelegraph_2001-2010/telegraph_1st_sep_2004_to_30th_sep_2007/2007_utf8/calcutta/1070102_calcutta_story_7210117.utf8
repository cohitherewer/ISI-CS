 You share your birthday with...

 Cuba Gooding Jr and Kate Bosworth

 You possess charm, diplomatic skills and non-aggressive powers of persuasion. You like meeting people and working in groups. You excel as a representative or a leader of a group. You have a habit of holding back your emotions. You are not only a quick learner, but also a good retainer. You have a realistic attitude about money. Kusum Bhandari

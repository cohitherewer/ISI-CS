 Wednesday, 7am: A black Qualis crawls through knee-deep water down Alipore Bodyguard Lines towards the Met office.

 Huddled inside are seven meteorologists, reporting for work after Tuesdays drencher left the city and its adjoining pockets marooned.

 On reaching office, they rush to the control room and take up position behind computers, tune into the Doppler radar and pore over charts left behind by their colleagues on the night shift.

 Eyes glued to the radar screen, a duty officer senses danger and calls up the director of the weather section, G.C. Debnath, at 8.30am. Sir, last nights low pressure has intensified into a depression and is hovering over the Bangladesh coast, he warns the director.

 Debnath hurries to office and stands in front of Alipore Bodyguard Lines, waiting for the same Qualis to ferry him across the waterlogged stretch. I see on the screen a huge mass of cloud spread across Bangladesh and the Bengal delta and realise that we are in trouble, recalls Debnath.

 We have to prepare the forecast fast, as a host of people have to be alerted. There is already a flood of queries from government departments, defence, port, railways and the general public. For us, it is a war-like situation, says Debnath.

 Helping him discharge his duty at this crucial juncture are a dozen meteorologists on the shift, who have braved the deluge and come from faraway places like Behala, Khardah, Baranagar, Howrah and Hooghly.

 Since Tuesday, Debnath and his team have been assessing the situation every three hours and conferring with Delhis Mausam Bhavan about the movement of various atmospheric systems. 

 We analyse the atmospheric factors and draw our inferences, and then prepare the forecast in consultation with Delhi, says Debnath, who is assisted by a team of 50 working in four shifts.

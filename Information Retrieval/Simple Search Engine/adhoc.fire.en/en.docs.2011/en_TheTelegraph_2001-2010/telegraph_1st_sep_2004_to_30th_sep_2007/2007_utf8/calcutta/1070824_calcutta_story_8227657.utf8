 Apathy and Samaritan

 Satyabrata Paul, 35, a trader in Balichak, West Midnapore, reached Calcutta early on Thursday to visit his ailing brother-in-law in Alipore.

 Around 6am, he was crossing Chowringhee Road under the Park Street flyover to get to a bus stop. Suddenly, a Matador van came out of nowhere and hit him. Paul slumped to the ground, unconscious. And the Matador sped away.

 When I regained consciousness momentarily, I felt a terrible pain in my legs. I realised I was still lying on the road. I lost consciousness again, recounted Paul, from his SSKM Hospital bed, later in the day.

 Taxis and cars sped past the man lying bleeding on Chowringhee. Till one carrying Paul Walsh and a friend headed for rugby practice on the Maidan saw him and stopped.

 The man was lying with his legs bent back under his body. He was bleeding and it looked like he had broken his legs, recalled Walsh, a former official of the British deputy high commission, who now works with Future Hope.

 Walsh and his rugby mate tried to flag down passing taxis and cars for help. But no one stopped and there was no policeman in sight. Then I saw a military police Gypsy coming down Mayo Road. I flagged it down and asked for assistance. Though the men in the jeep could see a seriously injured man lying on the road, they refused to help, saying they were not authorised to do so, and drove off, said Walsh.

 Walsh was shaken to face such apathy in a city hailed for its compassion. I was shocked to find no one, including the military police, stopping to help. 

 Finally, a taxi did stop and and a policeman Priyanjan Majumdar of the South Guard also arrived to help the injured man into the taxi and take him to SSKM Hospital.

 Paul was brought to the emergency observatory ward of SSKM Hospital and later shifted to the orthopaedic ward. He has fractures in both legs. There was a lot of bleeding from various cuts and bruises before he was brought in, said medical superintendent Ashok Ghosh.

 That was while Calcutta looked the other way.

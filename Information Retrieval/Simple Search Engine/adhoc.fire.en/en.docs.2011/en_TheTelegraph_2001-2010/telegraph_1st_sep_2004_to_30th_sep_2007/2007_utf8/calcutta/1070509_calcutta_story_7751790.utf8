 Lakhs missing from bank

 - Cashier, another employee held, cash yet to be recovered

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A sum of Rs 6.49 lakh has gone missing from the Gariahat branch of Syndicate Bank. Two employees of the bank were arrested on Tuesday in connection with the incident.

 Around 11am on Monday, within an hour of the banks opening, Jyotirmoy Mondal, who was serving as cashier of the branch for the day, told the manager that a part of the money that had been kept in his drawer an hour earlier could not be found. The money had been withdrawn from the banks vault.

 The 55-year-old acting cashier and Haradhan Singharoy, a Class IV employee, were subsequently arrested. The money, however, has not been found.

 Soon after the loss was detected, the top brass of the bank conducted an internal inquiry and tried to trace the money. On Tuesday, the branch manager lodged an FIR with us. We made the arrests after that, said a senior officer of Gariahat police station. 

 After the branch opened on Monday, manager S.N. Mishra and senior clerk Mala Subhramanium went to the vault, along with Singharoy, who has been at the branch for more than a decade. 

 Mishra unlocked the vault with his set of keys.

 A. Piyar, another senior officer of the branch, has a duplicate set of keys. He is on leave. 

 In the presence of Singharoy, Mishra withdrew about Rs 8.04 lakh from the vault and kept the money on a tray. The manager and the senior clerk then completed the formalities and locked the vault. Mishra asked Singharoy to keep the money in the cashiers cubicle, barely five feet from the vault, said the police officer. 

 Singharoy told the police that he took the tray to the cashiers cubicle and kept the money in the drawer. He said he had shut the drawer, since there was no one in the cubicle. Since the branchs regular cashier Adhir Biswas was on leave, Mishra asked Mondal to stand in for him. This was around 10.15 am.

 Around 11am, the cashier told the manager that a part of the money had vanished from the drawer. By then, some transactions had taken place. Later, it was found that Rs 6.49 lakh was missing, said the police officer.

 When contacted, Mishra refused to comment on the matter. We are guided by certain regulations. Hence, I cant speak on this incident, he said.

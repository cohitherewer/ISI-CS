 Carrier in network growth

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Low-fare domestic carrier IndiGo is enhancing its route network in eastern India.

 After starting two daily flights from Calcutta to Mumbai and Jaipur, airline officials said on Friday that they were eyeing other destinations, too. In February, we are starting a daily flight to Chennai and one more to Delhi, said Bruce Ashby, president and CEO of IndiGo. IndiGo plans to fly to Patna, Bhubaneswar and Northeastern stops from Calcutta.

 The airline started operations from Calcutta last year, with daily flights to Delhi, Nagpur and Guwahati.

 The Calcutta-Jaipur flight will arrive at Calcutta at 8.45 am and leave for Jaipur at 6.40 pm. The Calcutta-Mumbai flight will take off from Calcutta at 10.25 am and arrive from Mumbai at 5.05 pm.

 IndiGo is operating new Airbus 320 on the new routes. Officials said this was the sixth new aircraft acquired by the airline.

 According to Ashby, the airline had a good occupancy on the two inaugural flights the Mumbai flight was 93 per cent full and the Jaipur one 87 per cent.

 The Calcutta-Chennai flight and the second one to Delhi would be launched on February 3, the IndiGo CEO said. The Delhi flight will arrive at Calcutta in the morning and return to the capital in the evening. The one to Chennai will leave from Calcutta in the morning and come back in the evening.

 The airline later plans to start operations to Bangalore and Lucknow. Not many airlines fly to Lucknow from Calcutta, said an official of the airline.

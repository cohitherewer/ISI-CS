 - Low-budget Bollywood floods cinemas before festive season biggie rush

 A STAFF REPORTER

 No stars in sight in the next couple of weeks, with films like Dhol and Manorama

 Make hay before the biggies come to play. Thats the Friday formula for a barrage of low-budget Bollywood films, squeezing into a box-office window left ajar by festive blockbusters. So, unlike the usual trickle of releases, a flood of eight films ranging from medium to small to very small will hit the multiplexes over the next couple of Fridays.

 Dhol, Manorama: Six Feet Under, Chhodon Na Yaar, Loins of Punjab Presents, Dil Dosti Etc, Go, Johnny Gaddaar, Speed all have a box-office tryst this fortnight. One batch of biggies Heyy Babyy, Partner and Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag has run its course and another Laaga Chunari Mein Daag, Bhool Bhulaiyaa, Om Shanti Om and Sawaariya will storm the cinemas from the Mahalaya week.

 So, the fight is on among the small fry. Most of these films havent been getting slots for a while due to the onslaught of bigger films like Heyy Babyy and Partner, explains Saurabh Varma of INOX. It, therefore, makes sense for them to release in a rush now, before the blockbuster season commences.

 But do the Abhay Deols and Kunal Khemus of the cine world have any real hope of box-office success? Their only hope is word of mouth, as none of them will get a big opening, observes a Mumbai-based trade analyst.

 With budgets in the Rs 4 crore bracket against an estimated budget of Rs 60 crore for a Saawariya even a modest trot at the box office will mean big business for the small films. Its not that small films dont stand a chance. Sleeper hits like Zeher and Kalyug, Iqbal and Bheja Fry have played David to many a Bolly Goliath. But that remains the exception rather than the rule at the box office where size does matter.

 At least these films will get a look in if they come now, says Prashant Srivastava of 89 Cinemas. If they release any time during the festive season, they will get lost in the crowd of big films.

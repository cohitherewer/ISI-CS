The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 First fine in RTI

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 The state information commission awarded the first penalty, under the Right to Information Act, 2005, to the cooperation department for failing to gather a piece of information for a petitioner, within the stipulated time. 

 Chief information commissioner Arun Bhattacharya asked the cooperation department to pay a token amount as compensation for harassing the petitioner. 

 We have instructed the cooperation department to pay Rs 1,000 as compensation for harassing Saroj Khettry, the petitioner, as the department could not provide him with the information in the stipulated time, stated Arun Bhattacharya, chief information commissioner of the state. 

 Khettry, 74, had sought a copy of the legal opinion that the department of co-operation had taken concerning the allotment of his flat on Jhowtala Road. 

 His quest dates back to the late 1970s, when he decided to leave his flat by resigning from the cooperative society, near Purna cinema in Bhowanipore. 

 He had paid Rs 4.47 lakh for the 850-sq-ft flat. Khettry vacated the flat as he was told that the booking amount would be returned. 

 The promoter and the society did not return the money and even handed over the flat to someone else. Since then, I have been trying in vain to know the name of the owner of the flat, said Khettry.

 After running from pillar to post for years, Khettrys plea was first heard in October last year, when he was assured that the owners name would be revealed to him. 

 Initially, the principal information officer told me in a letter that his department has the legal document. But later, his department officials said the document had gone missing, said Khettry. 

 On April 3, Khettrys appeal was heard by the commission, where the chief information commissioner ruled out that misplacing the document cannot be an excuse for not furnishing a piece of information.

 The commissioner ruled that the penalty was for the entire department, including principal information officer H.P. Roy.

 He added that only the principal information officer should not be blamed for the matter as the entire department had ignored Khettrys plea and harassed him.

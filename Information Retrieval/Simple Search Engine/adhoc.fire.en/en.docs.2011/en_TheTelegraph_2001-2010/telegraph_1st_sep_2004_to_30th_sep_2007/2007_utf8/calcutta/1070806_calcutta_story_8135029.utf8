 JEE spectre rattles tech varsity

 - Strict checks to ensure quality of engineering admissions

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The medical entrance test scam has left the West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) wary of the quality of students who have taken admission to private engineering colleges.

 To ensure that there is no irregularity in the admission process and that no undeserving candidate gets to study in any private engineering college, the university has decided to introduce strict norms while issuing registration certificates to the students.

 We will conduct rigorous checks to ensure that only genuine students take admission in the private colleges, said Syed Rafiqul Islam, the registrar of WBUT, the affiliating body of all private engineering institutions in the state.

 To guard itself against a medical entrance-like scam, the university has requested the joint entrance examination (JEE) board to prepare CDs containing details of the students including their academic background who have been allotted seats in private colleges.

 While issuing registration certificates after admission, the information in the CDs will be matched with that in the forms supplied by the colleges. If there is any discrepancy, the certificate will be withheld, said Islam.

 The WBUT move coincides with the surge in the demand for engineering seats in the state colleges.

 In 2006, the last of the 17,000-odd engineering seats in the state went to a student whose rank was 70,000-plus on the JEE merit list.

 This year, the last berth was allotted to a candidate whose rank was 28,032.

 There was an unexpected rush for the 17,000-odd engineering seats this time. The trend is encouraging. Last year, we had to interview around 70,000 students to fill up the same number of seats, said Ajit Chattopadhyay, the convener of the central selection committee of the JEE board.

 Board officials attribute the drastic change to a sharp fall in the number of dropouts, students who have qualified in JEE but refused to take admission in any state college. 

 This suggests that far fewer students compared to previous years had opted for institutes in other states, said an official.

 Another reason for the fall in the number of dropouts could be that the board this year had called the first 45,000 students at one go for counselling.

 The students knew that if they failed to make it to the counselling venue on Day I, their seats would be filled up by others, said another official of the JEE board.

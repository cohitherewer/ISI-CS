The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hello biz baron, bye bye Becks

 The long-awaited Guru hit the silver screen on Friday and within hours bloggers were letting the world know what exactly they thought of the Mani Ratnam film starring Abhishek Bachhan and Aishwarya Rai. 

 Deep (http://www.whoisdeep.com) has drawn up a list of things Guru has going for it. It is directed by the guru of direction, Mani Ratnam; it has music is by the guru of music industry, A.R. Rahman; it is based on the life of business guru Dhirubhai Ambani.

 He continues: Everything is in the right place and very well balanced... Aishwarya does very well as a girl from a small village, but the movie totally belongs to Abhishek.

 A Netizen at Tellypundit Entertainment Blog (http:// www.tellypundit.com) focuses on Vidya Balans first onscreen kiss. From Parineeta to Lage Raho Munnabhai, we have known Vidya Balan as the beautiful girl-next-door. Her image might change after Guru, in which she has a liplock with Madhavan.

 The southern hero proposes to Vidya in the film and this is followed by a kiss. He points out that the Hrithik-Aishwarya smooch in Dhoom:2 was talked about more than anything else in the film. Will Abhishek miss out in Guru too, with the Vidya-Madhavan kiss generating hype? Only time will tell

 There are posts on the debut screening of Guru in Toronto on Thursday night. Arasto (http://fadedyouth. blogspot.com) reports how the city was turned upside down as Indias Brangelina, otherwise known as Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan, arrived (several hours late!) for the gala premiere of their new film, thrilling the gazillion South Asian movie lovers who gathered outside the historic Elgin Theatre. This marks the first time a Bollywood film has ever debuted outside India, sparking many to dub the city Bollywood West.

 At http://www.murphysmoviereviews. net, a blogger points to similarities between Guru and Citizen Kane. While Guru is not quite on the same level as that masterpiece (after all, what is?), it does rank pretty close in its depiction of the life of a man consumed by his business pursuits and his dreams.

 News that British soccer star David Beckham and wife Victoria will be crossing the Atlantic has attracted attention aplenty in bloggers park.

 The free-kick king will quit Real Madrid at the end of the season and sign up with Los Angeles Galaxy.

 For Leone (http://qek. blogspot. com), the move signals semi retirement and footballing obscurity for Beckham.

 A blogger at http://yellowhand. vox. com has written a public letter to Beckham wishing him good luck. Im not sure what exactly the Galaxys publicity people are expecting you to do when you get there, but unless you play every game the way you did in the match against Greece before World Cup 2002, the fans are going to be disappointed.

 The Omnipotent Q (http://quinnmedia.blogspot.com) writes: The Major League Soccer (MLS) needed a megastar to put the league on the map, and Beckham, the former England captain, fits the bill. There have been comparisons made to Pele signing for New York Cosmos in 1975 giving the struggling NASL instant credibility. Beckham should do that easily for MLS He isnt the best player in the world, but probably the best known.

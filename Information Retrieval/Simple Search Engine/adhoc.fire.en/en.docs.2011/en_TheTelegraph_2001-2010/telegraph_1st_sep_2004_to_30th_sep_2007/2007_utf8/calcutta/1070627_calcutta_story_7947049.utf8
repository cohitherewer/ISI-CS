 Muck that is Mechhua market

 Dont be surprised if you hear that the apple on your breakfast table was lying in muck.

 If the fruit has been sourced from the Mechhua phalpatti, in Chitpur, chances are it was rolling unattended for hours in germs-filled garbage.

 Welcome to eastern Indias largest wholesale fruit market, a filthy dump that even old-timers are avoiding.

 It was a tradition in my in-laws house to buy fruits from Mechhua. But the overflowing muck and stench have made the place so repulsive that we now visit the Kumartuli Food Bazaar. Its a lot better, said Sudipta De, a resident of Hari Ghosh Street, in Shyambazar.

 Things get even worse after a spell of shower, said Prasanta Chaudhuri, a resident of Dum Dum, who was once a regular in Mechhua.

 Private contractors are assigned with cleaning the more than century-old market, spread across 30 acres. 

 But the market is not cleaned on most days, alleged Pervez Alam, secretary of the market and Calcutta Fruit Association.

 Md Rustam, who has been a fruit dealer since the Forties, admitted that the congestion and lack of cleanliness have been ruining the business.

 Besides, the space is not enough to accommodate the 2,000-odd traders.

 Customers cannot move around freely. The market also faces the spill-over of the traffic jam on Rabindra Sarani, said Rustom.

 Md Sohrab, local MLA and president of Calcutta Fruit and Vegetable Society, claimed that the government has turned a deaf ear to repeated pleas to shift the market to a more spacious location.

 Admitting that something needs to be done about the market, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said: We will relocate the market to Rajarhat as soon as we get a plot there.

 Another problem faced by Mechhua is the lack of infrastructure which is preventing the consumer market with a daily turnover of Rs 2 crore from graduating to an export zone.

 We export to Bangladesh, but western countries remain out of bounds for us, as we do not have the advanced system of cleaning fruits, said fruit dealer Mukhtar Alam.

 We will surely look into the matter if the traders association in Mechhua approaches us, said food processing minister Mohanto Chatterjee.

 Though a few dealers talk about law and order problems, the local MLA said the situation is much better than what it used to be a few years ago.

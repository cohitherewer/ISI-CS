The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Machher Paturi is like Pattrani Machhi

 A little weary but all smiles. One of Bollywoods best-looking men surfaced on Friday afternoon after a gruelling schedule for Rituparno Ghoshs The Last Lear. This is his first English film, in which he plays a character called Siddharth. Thats all Arjun Rampal is willing to reveal at the moment. Its too premature to talk about my role. All I can say is that its going to be a very different film, not just for me but also Mr (Amitabh) Bachchan, Preity (Zinta) and Ritu (Rituparno Ghosh). I have always wanted to work with Ritu. I am excited that he thought I would fit the role. The Last Lear has a nice ensemble cast with Tollywood actors, said Arjun, in blue jeans and shirt, relaxing in the lounge of a city hotel before a night-long shoot.

 Arjun has plans to see as much of Calcutta as possible during his 20-day stay. I dont want to see Calcutta from a car. I would like to take a walk around certain places like Victoria Memorial, and take a tram ride across the city. I hope to take some nice photographs, too Jisshu is making some plans for me, so I will be doing the rounds with him.

 And what about digging into Bangla food? I had Machher Paturi, which tasted a lot like Parsi Pattrani Machhi, he smiled. Picture by Aranya Sen

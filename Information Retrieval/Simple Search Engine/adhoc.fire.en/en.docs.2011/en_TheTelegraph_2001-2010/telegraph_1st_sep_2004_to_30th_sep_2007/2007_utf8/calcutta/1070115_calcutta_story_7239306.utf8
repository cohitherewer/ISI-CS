 Its not just about new-look denims, but also about new-look showrooms. Exclusive Lee brand outlets in Bangalore already sport an image makeover and next in line is the showroom at City Centre.

 The makeover marks a joint venture between VF Corporation, USA, and Arvind Brands Limited, India. It was a logical step forward. Arvind Brands Limited was a licensee with us for over 10 years, says Chakor Jain, business head, Lee India. The new company, VF Arvind Brands Private Limited, came into effect on September 1, 2006.

 The City Centre store revamp is slated for mid-year. Without dropping its chic and fashionable appeal, the address will also sport a bronze rugged look. Unfinished and untreated walls, factory furniture, waist-down mannequins on the walls and a rough appearance will be the signature look.

 The monochromatic palette of black, white and shades of grey will bring the many colours of merchandise into the spotlight. The new look will be more of an imposing image of black and white with innovative methods of fixtures. The idea is to give it the look of industrial grunge, says Jain.

 The brand that is almost a century old draws inspiration from the American industrial revolution. Lee jeans, overalls and coveralls have a history long associated with railroad workers, cowboys, farmers and seamen. Legend has it that Lees first apparel plant came up in 1912 after Henry David Lee saw that his chauffeur needed something to wear over his uniform while changing tyres or repairing his automobile. 

 The overall concept of the store may be likened to vintage meets contemporaries. The theme draws inspiration from vintage forms and shapes but transforms them into something easily identifiable with the trend-conscious consumers.

 In Bangalore, classic furniture is hand-painted or airbrushed and metal introduced in its raw form adds an edge to the elegance. Large chandeliers accentuate the fusion of old and new. 

 We are constantly looking at upgrading our stores. It is like fashion which is everchanging, says Jain.

 An end-of-season sale is on at the city showroom till February 4. The eastern region has a lot of potential. Several malls are springing up and our plans are big, smiles Jain.

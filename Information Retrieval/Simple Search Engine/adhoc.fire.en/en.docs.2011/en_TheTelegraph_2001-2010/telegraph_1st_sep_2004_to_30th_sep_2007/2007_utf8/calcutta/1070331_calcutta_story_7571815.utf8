The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Parleys on CAS second phase

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 Three months into the roll-out of the conditional access system (CAS) Phase I in the city, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is preparing for the launch of the second phase.

 Trai has invited city-based multi-system operators (MSOs) registered with the information and broadcasting ministry to a meeting on April 5. 

 Phase II of the roll-out will be discussed at the meet.

 The main point of discussion will be whether the next phase will cover the remaining parts of the metropolis or whether CAS will be launched zone-wise, said an industry insider.

 Abhijit Sanyal, Trais nodal officer in the city, said: Once the MSOs submit a status report, we are going to assess the situation and decide on the date and mode of the roll-out. We can expect things to be in place in another three months.

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA) has been divided by Trai into four zones Behala, north of the CMA, west bank of the Hooghly and south of the CMA.

 In the first phase, CAS was introduced in zone I.

 Zone II comprises Kalyani, Sodepur, Dum Dum, Khardah, Tallah Park, Kanchrapara, Naihati, Barasat, Barrackpore and Shyamnagar. 

 Zone III covers Howrah, Bally, Liluah, Shibpur, Bandel, Andul, Uttarpara, Chandernagore, Uluberia. 

 Esplanade, Park Street, Camac Street, Salt Lake, Lake Gardens, Garia, Bhowanipore, Ballygunge, Tollygunge and the surrounding areas make up Zone IV.

 Trai has learnt its lesson from the first phase of the roll-out. The MSOs were not prepared for the launch and there was complete chaos. Most of the cable subscribers didnt know when it would take effect. There was a cable blackout for more than 48 hours, said another industry official.

 This time, the regulator is taking note of the level of preparedness among the MSOs and the cable operators, he added.

 According to many, the roll-out of CAS in phase I was not a success. The lack of technical expertise and will on the part of MSOs led to the delays. A mere 10 per cent of the subscriber base of 350,000 switched to CAS. This time, we need to be extra cautious, observed a Trai official.

 Trai has asked the MSOs to mention in the status report the number of set-top boxes they have, the time needed to procure more sets to meet the expected demand and the time needed to set up infrastructure and encrypt the digital signals.

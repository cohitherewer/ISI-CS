 Theres Sourav, and then theres the rest... A look at whos pushing which product and why 

 Theres Sourav, and then theres the rest... A look at whos pushing which product and why 

 Two months back, when he sat in an empty stadium, as a spectator, and pleaded with us to support a Team India that had no place for him and also pick up a bottle of Pepsi we cringed.

 Today, we crow. For Sourav Ganguly is back where he belongs in the middle, in whites now and in blues soon. And in the advertising space on billboards now, on screen in a big way soon.

 Souravs can-do image and his strong traits are reflected through his personality... Pepsi is all about making an impression through sheer force of persona which Sourav has helped in reinforcing, says Ravi Kapoor, general manager of Pepsico India Pvt Ltd.

 What about crickets Royal Bengal Tiger being made to mew in the Pepsi Blue Billion campaign? Since Sourav was out of the team we wanted to generate the feel through him that it does not matter where you stand or what you do, you can still be with the team and carry the spirit, says Kapoor.

 Now, of course, the roar is back. Not just from Souravs blade but also from the product pushers who have partnered him all the way. We have stuck to Sourav for the past five years because he is an icon. Sourav being mentally agile and physically fit goes very well with Sona Chandi Chyawanprash. We have acquired more than 10 per cent share of the national market in five years and due credit goes to Sourav, smiles Aditya Agarwal, director of Emami Group.

 With Sourav back in full flow, we turn the spotlight on a recent phenomenon local celebrities on billboards. A celebrity face is a clutter-breaker and so companies take the easy way out. Many products borrow an attribute of the celebritys image. Besides, ads are a fantastic means of publicity and easy money for celebrities, says marketing expert and Metro columnist Shiloo Chattopadhyay.

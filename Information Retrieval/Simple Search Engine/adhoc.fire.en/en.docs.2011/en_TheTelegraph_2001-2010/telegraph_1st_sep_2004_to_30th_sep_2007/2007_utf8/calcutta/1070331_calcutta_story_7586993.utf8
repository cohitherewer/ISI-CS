The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Held for Metro tease

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A shoe salesman who had allegedly been stalking a young working woman in the Metro Railway for a month was arrested at MG Road station on Thursday evening.

 Co-passengers of the woman, in her mid-20s, detained Samir Das, in his late 20s, after he allegedly grabbed her hand on a train. Jorasanko police later took him into custody.

 The accused works in a popular shoe outlet in central Calcutta. He was arrested on the charges of outraging a womans modesty and molestation, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Pradip Kumar Chatterjee on Friday. 

 According to police, Das had been passing remarks at Piu (name changed) for the past 15 days, even though she consistently ignored him. 

 He had allegedly been following her for a month from Rabindra Sarobar station, where she took a train every day to MG Road.

 For the past fortnight, Das had been taking advantage of the peak-hour crowd to get close to Piu, she said. 

 On Wednesday, he approached Piu after she got off the train at MG Road and sought a date with her. When she tried to raise an alarm, he disappeared into the crowd.

 Piu reported the matter to officers of Jorasanko thana deployed at the station. One of the officers gave her his cellphone number and asked her to call him if Das bothered her again.

 After Das was detained by her co-passengers on Thursday evening, Piu called up the officer on his cellphone and reported the matter. 

 Police are finding out if Das has criminal antecedents.

 Flight path to weddings

 - Marriage guests turn lean season for airlines into busy season 

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Rajesh Gidwani, a businessman based in Calcutta, got his son Lav married in Jaipur on January 29. The entire family, along with friends, flew to the Rajasthan capital for the wedding.

 We used to book a train compartment for travelling in a group to a marriage or some other function. For my sons wedding, for the first time, we flew, said Rajesh. 

 The 40 baratis took a flight to New Delhi and proceeded to Jaipur on another flight.

 The Gidwanis are no exceptions. Drop in airfare and proliferation of low-cost carriers have sparked off a new travel trend. Wedding guests who travelled by train are now opting to fly, turning lean seasons for airlines into busy ones.

 Many groups travelling to weddings are choosing planes over trains. This year, there has been a significant increase in group bookings on flights, confirmed Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India. 

 This time of the year is considered a lean season for airlines due to examinations, financial year-end and other factors. But the airlines are doing quite well now, added Punjabi.

 The drop in passengers this season is less pronounced, agreed an official of Air Sahara. According to him, more passengers are opting to fly because of the narrowing of the gap between the AC two-tier and plane fares. The minimum airfare is about 10 to 15 per cent more than an airconditioned coach fare. 

 The difference in fare is negated by the time saved, observed Jasmine Bhargava, who works in London. Her son Rahul will get married in the city in April. With her nephews marriage also being organised in Calcutta later that month, the family members are planning to fly in from Goa, where most of them are based, and London.

 The hassle of handling luggage becomes a cause of concern for large groups travelling by train. You dont have to face the hassle if you are flying, said Jasmine.

 Flying offers other advantages as well. If a group of 40 to 50 are travelling, arranging for food and other necessities becomes a problem, said Raja Sajnani. For his sister Shalinis wedding, he flew in 30 relatives and friends from Jaipur. 

 The low-cost carriers have registered an increase in group bookings since last year. For instance, about 30 groups took SpiceJet flights this season, significantly more than the last one.

 Smaller groups, consisting of about 10 people, are also flying now. With families spread over different cities, groups are flying to the marriage venue from different locations, increasing airline bookings, said Ajay Jasra, spokesperson for SpiceJet.

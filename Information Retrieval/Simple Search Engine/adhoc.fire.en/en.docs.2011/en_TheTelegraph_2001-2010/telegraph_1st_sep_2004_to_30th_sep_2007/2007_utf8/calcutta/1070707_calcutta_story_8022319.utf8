 Trade in doldrums

 Traders across the city have been suffering huge losses due to the continuous rain and waterlogging, as they couldnt open their shops for the past four days.

 Several pockets in the business hub, spanning Burrabazar, MG Road and Girish Park, remained flooded on Friday. If you take into account the losses incurred by all the shop-owners, the figure will run into crores, said Nandan Pachisia, a spice wholesaler of Kalakar Street.

 We are in the embroidery trade. Saris worth more than Rs 50,000 that customers left with us were damaged after water entered our shop. Ill have to pay the customers from my pocket. Who is going to take responsibility for this? asked an angry Pramod Sharma, of Shilu Tracing and Embroidery, at 109 Muktaram Babu Street.

 Faced with the residents wrath, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and finance minister Asim Dasgupta had to beat a hasty retreat from the waterlogged Muktaram Babu Street on Thursday.

 Every year, we suffer huge losses but the authorities never take any action. We pay all types of taxes but still there is waterlogging in front of our shops. The snapped power cables, too, have not been restored, complained Pachisia.

 The scene is much the same at New Market. Shops that stay open till late in the night have been downing their shutters by 7pm for the past few days.

 Customers flock to the market round the year, said Abbas Ali Iqbal, owner of Magic Shoe Gallery on Lindsay Street. On any given day, I sell goods worth Rs 7,000 to Rs 8,000. But since Tuesday, the sales have halved.

 At Forum, on Elgin Road, the two major crowd pullers Shoppers Stop and Inox chose to operate only in the second half. Forum has never faced such a time since it opened four years ago, said Ujjal, the general manager of the mall. Footfall has dropped by 50 per cent and more than 15 per cent of the shops are not opening.

 The turnout was slightly better at City Centre, because large parts of Salt Lake remained free from waterlogging on Friday. Were still having fewer visitors. I hope the rain stops, said the spokesperson for a Salt Lake mall.

 Girl withdraws suit 

 - Father fears for students career

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Debapriya Sengupta, who did well in the joint entrance examination (JEE), but failed in science subjects in Higher Secondary (HS) this year, has withdrawn her case against the HS Council. Her father said he is afraid that Debapriyas academic career will be ruined if she continues the case.

 The court had ordered reassessment of Debapriyas HS answer scripts. The council had moved an appeal against the order.

 Even if my client wins the appeal, the council will move the Supreme Court and it will take a lot of time to settle the issue, said Biswarup Bhattacharya, who appeared for Debapriya. Her father Debatosh wrote to the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.K. Roy on Tuesday saying his daughter is no longer interested in pursuing the case.

 Debapriyas rank on the JEE list is 1700, but she cannot take admission in an engineering college as she failed in physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology in the board examination. 

 Justice B. Somadder had ordered for the reassessment of her answer scripts. He had passed a similar order for other students who had secured ranks in the JEE but failed in their HS exams.

 The council had moved an appeal against the order before the division bench, stating that there is no provision in the rules for reassessment of answer scripts. When the matter came up for hearing on Tuesday, Debatoshs letter was placed before the court. 

 Bhattacharya claimed that the division bench would settle the matter since the judge had passed similar orders for other students. The council moved the appeal against the orders by Justice Somadder. Whether or not the court has the liberty to ask the council to reassess the answer scripts will be decided by the division bench, said the lawyer.

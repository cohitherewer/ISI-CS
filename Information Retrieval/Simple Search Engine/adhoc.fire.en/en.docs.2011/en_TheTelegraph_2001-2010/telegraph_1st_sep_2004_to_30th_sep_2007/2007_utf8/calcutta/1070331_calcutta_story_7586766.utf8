The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Passports made simpler

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Passport-seekers from across the city and also the fringes need not travel all the way to the regional passport office in BBD Bag.

 Following the Bangalore model, several centres will be opened in the city and its adjoining areas to receive documents from the applicants and hand them over the passports. 

 The first two centres will be operational in a month or two. We are planning more for the fringes, M.K. Singh, regional passport officer (RPO), said on Friday. 

 To be called Tilottama, the centres are being opened jointly by the passport department and the state-owned Webel.

 The centres will collect the necessary documents from applicants and send them for police verification. The verification report will be forwarded to the head office, which will then issue the passport and send it to the centre concerned. The applicant will collect the passport from there, Singh explained.

 Calcutta will be the second city after Bangalore to have such centres. A team of officers will soon visit the Karnataka capital to study how the decentralised system operates.

 The RPO also announced a few changes in the rules for issuing passports that will benefit applicants.

 A 10-year passport can now be obtained under the Tatkal scheme within seven days, instead 10 days, on payment of an additional fee of Rs 1,500 (in addition to the stipulated fee of Rs 1,000). 

 Or, it can be obtained within eight to 14 days, instead of 11 to 20 days, on a payment of an additional fee of Rs 1,000.

 The passport department now will accept verification certificates issued by the officer-in-charge of a police station or chairpersons of business bodies, like Ficci, CII and Assocham.

 Maid link in flat burglary

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The theft of valuables from an apartment on the 10th floor of a building at 52C Ballygunge Circular Road was detected on Thursday night by the parents of Pradip Sabriwal, who owns the flat. Sabriwal has gone to visit his son in Singapore.

 Police said Rs 1.3 lakh, an Omega watch and a gold chain were missing from an almirah. The domestic help has been detained for interrogation.

 Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said Sabriwal had left the city a couple of days ago and handed over the keys of his apartment to his parents, who live in a flat on the sixth floor of the same building.

 Sabriwal did not take the keys with him so that his maid could clean the apartment everyday, said Chatterjee. The maid has been doing so.

 On Thursday night, Sabriwals parents entered their sons flat to check whether everything was all right. When they found one almirah open, they immediately contacted their son, who confirmed the list of stolen valuables, said Chatterjee.

 The police found that the lock of the almirah was broken. The maid, who had joined a few months ago, was detained.

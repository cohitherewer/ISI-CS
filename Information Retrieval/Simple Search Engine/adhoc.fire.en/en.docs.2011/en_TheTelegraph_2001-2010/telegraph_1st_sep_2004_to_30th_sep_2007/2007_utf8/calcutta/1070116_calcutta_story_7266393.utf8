 Private team in upkeep of tech hub

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two private companies Enkon and Selvel will take up the comprehensive roadside beautification project at Nabadiganta Industrial Township in Salt Lakes Sector V. 

 This was decided in an agreement signed between the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority and a consortium of Enkon and Selvel on Monday at Writers Buildings. 

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya and S.A. Ahmed, chairman of Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority were present.

 According to the agreement, the private partners will develop and maintain the works of beautification and will pay a sum of Rs 5.10 crore over a period of 10 years to the township authority. 

 This kind of tie-up is a first of its kind. Sector V has become the premier destination for industrial enterprises and, therefore, the infrastructure should be maintained properly, Bhattacharya said. 

 The private partners, under the proposed project, will provide facilities like passenger shelters, street lights (including their replacement), a police control room, kiosks, phone booths and footpaths. The work will start soon after the private partners are handed over the possession. 

 There are many encroachments on the pavements here. Besides, there are a number of unauthorised billboards on the roadside. We will first demolish the billboards and then hand over possession to the private players, said Ahmed.

 The township authority will also maintain an escrow account, from where money can be withdrawn only for the project or other works. 

 A number of projects, like a water supply network and a sewage system, are being chalked out. The CMDA is working on the plan, minister Bhattacharya confirmed. 

 Food courts will be constructed to bring all the roadside eateries under one roof. A bus terminus, shopping malls, allied facilities and improvement and repair of the road network is also on the cards.

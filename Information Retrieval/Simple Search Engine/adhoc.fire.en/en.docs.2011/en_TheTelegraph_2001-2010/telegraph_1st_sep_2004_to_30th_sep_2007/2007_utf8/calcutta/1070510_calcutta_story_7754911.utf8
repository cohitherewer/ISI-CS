 A mob of over 500 people set a private bus ablaze after it crushed to death a 24-year-old man on Kachchi Sadak, in Garden Reach, on Wednesday morning.

 The protesters, all local residents, also blocked the road, demanding that the driver and conductor be arrested. They even sought a ban on autorickshaws, blaming them for the frequent mishaps in the area.

 The residents alleged that three of them were injured in a police lathicharge, but officers denied the claim.

 Police said Muhammad Azhar, a resident of Metiabruz, lost his balance while trying to board a running bus on route 42B and fell on the road, before being mowed down by the rear wheels of the vehicle. 

 An employee of a leather goods factory, Azhar was on his way to work with a friend.

 The residents immediately blocked the road and set the bus on fire. They tried to prevent fire tenders and the police from reaching the spot, prompting the officers to seek reinforcements from South Port, West Port and Taratala thanas. Two tenders finally reached the spot and put out the blaze.

 They were demanding the arrest of the driver and the conductor and also a ban on autorickshaws, on the grounds that they disrupt traffic, said an officer. The driver has been identified and summoned.

 Deputy commissioner (port) Rajiv Mishra said: The force resorted to a mild lathicharge to disperse the crowd, though no one was injured.

 It took over two hours for the situation to return to normal. The body was removed around 11.30am and sent to SSKM Hospital, from where it was shifted to Kantapukur police morgue.

 Mishaps are frequent here. Last year, a seven-year-old boy was run over by a bus a few yards from todays accident spot. Mishaps will continue unless autorickshaws are banned, said Siraj Ahmed, a local resident. Autorickshaw-drivers briefly suspended operations to protest the allegations against them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A hard days night

 Night-shifters face a tough time going back home, report Poulomi Banerjee and Malini Banerjee

 They are there much after the last diner has left the restaurant. They scrub the floors and clean messy toilets long after the last visitor has left the mall after the last multiplex show. They sit over account books hours after the caf has closed and guard offices and homes long after the city is in bed. 

 Late night workers in the city, whose number is growing, return home in ingenious ways. The food courts at two leading malls take their last order between 10.15 and 10.30pm, the restaurants in Park Street accept orders till 11.30pm, some cafs are open till midnight and the last show at a major multiplex gives over well after midnight.

 Theres no Metro then, few or no buses and no company drop for floor-level workers. Some pool money and take a share taxi, expensive though it is, some cycle, others simply walk. 

 There are three women working in the housekeeping department. Our shift gives over at 10pm. No woman employee is allowed to stay back in the mall at night. Some of us stay quite far away, like along the Bypass. We just gang up with the others and walk home. Sometimes one of the men gives me a lift on his bicycle, says Sonali Biswas, who works in the department at a leading mall.

 An employee at the food court at the mall says: Some of us stay in the suburbs and catch the last train home, but theres nothing to take us to the stations. We usually have to walk to either Sealdah or Howrah station. 

 Fortunately, another well-known mall is a little more considerate. The staff at the food court usually get living quarters here or conveyance allowance, say Ranjeet and Arup, counter managers at the food court.

 But the situation is not easy for those who work as floor-attendants, clear the dishes, mop the floor or clean the toilets. Its at least midnight when we finish work. If there are autos we take them. Or else we walk. If we dont come, we are not paid on bandh days, says a housekeeping staff at the mall. 

 A security person at a popular Park Street restaurant says: Guests are allowed till 11.30pm, so the place shuts down around 12.30am. Most of us take share taxis. Some walk home and those who stay very far away often stay back. 

 The Caf Coffee Day outlet in Park Street wraps up around 1.30am, says an employee. Some people have to walk quite a distance at times, because it is difficult to get transport late in the night, he adds.

 The Caf Coffee Day outlet on Lake Road has similar hours. The final shift lasts from 2.30pm to 12.30am. Though no conveyance is provided its generally not a problem, as only those who stay close-by tend to work for the night shift, says an employee. 

 Many have taken it as their lot. We were told about the timings. How can we go and ask them for a drop now? asks Sonali. 

 Companies outsource these jobs to units that provide housekeeping facilities. The units that hire the workers try to cut down on overhead cost. There is no drop facility. Often the workers form colonies in the vicinity of the offices, like Sector V workers stay in Nayapatty, Ultadanga and Dum Dum Cantonment, says Upamanyu Bhattacharya, employee of an agency that provides housekeeping facilities.

 Mall authorities stress that they do not allow the staff to leave at night. My staff works in two shifts. The day shift gets over around 9pm and the night shift people take over. Women are not allowed on night shifts. The night-shift workers work till around midnight, then rest and start work again in the mornings, says Brigadier Kar, COO, City Centre.

 Aditya Mehta, executive assistant to the MD, Forum, says: The drop facility really depends upon the company we outsource the staffers from, but in an emergency we give them taxi fare.

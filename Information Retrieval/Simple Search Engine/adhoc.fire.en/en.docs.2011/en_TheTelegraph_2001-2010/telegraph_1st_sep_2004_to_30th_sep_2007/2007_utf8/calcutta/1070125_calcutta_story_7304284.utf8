The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Blacklist threat to save road

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has decided to stress on accountability to improve quality of work. It is going to conduct thorough checks and put in place safeguards before signing contracts with private agencies.

 The agencies will have to submit an undertaking that it will repair roads constructed by them, should they deteriorate within the guarantee period. The agency that built a road will be liable to repair it if the surface is damaged within three years of construction. We will stress on accountability, said P.R. Baviskar, chief executive officer of the CMDA.

 If an agency is found to be negligent, its security deposit will be seized or its name will be blacklisted, added Baviskar. The name of the agency may even be put up on a website. 

 We welcome the decision, since the agency is suffering from a funds crunch. The CMDA should have adopted such a stringent attitude earlier. There were some regulations, but they were hardly implemented, said general secretary of Development Employees Joint Action Committee of the agency P.B. Nag.

 The focus will be on accountability when the CMDA selects the agency for its next project, the facelift of the Park Circus Connector. It will cost about Rs 5.68 crore. The administrative and financial sanctions have been obtained for executing the scheme. 

 The stretch is frequently damaged due to lack of drainage facility, high sub-soil water level and heavy traffic load, explained chief engineer (traffic and transportation) of the CMDA, D. Bhattacharya. He will oversee the project.

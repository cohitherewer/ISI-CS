 The city and its neighbouring areas are likely to receive heavy rain on Friday. On Thursday, the city received 29 mm of rain. The sky was overcast from the afternoon and there were repeated thunderclaps.

 The monsoon trough is active over Gangetic Bengal. In some places, including Calcutta, we expect up to 60-80 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.

 Met officials said two atmospheric systems were responsible for Thursdays rain that began in the evening.

 A long trough of low pressure extends from Bihar to the Northeast, across sub-Himalayan Bengal. This trough is sucking in moisture from the Bay of Bengal, leading to heavy rain in north Bengal and light to moderate rain in Calcutta and the rest of south Bengal, said an official.

 On Thursday, a second low-pressure trough had formed over Gangetic Bengal. The trough extended from Bihar to the northern Bay, passing over Calcutta. The city and the neighbouring districts received rain under the combined influence of these two atmospheric systems, the official added.

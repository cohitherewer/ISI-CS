 Weird world

 When shall we three meet again/ In thunder, lightning, or in rain? The first play staged by Jinx House, a group of past and present students of St Xaviers College and Jadavpur University was a Stephen Briggs adaptation of Terry Practchetts Wyrd Sisters (picture

 above by Anindya Shankar Ray). It

 began with this famous discussion

 amongst the three witches and kept

 the Gyan Manch audience enthralled

 for the next two hours.

 The group formed barely two months back sparked off fits of laughter with powerful performances, particularly by Yajnaseni Das as Granny Weatherwax and Kenneth Mohanty as the Fool. 

 The play, directed by Debanjan Basak, a B.Com graduate from St Xaviers College, dealt with social problems that transcend time, portraying the hapless peasantry and general public reeling under the reign of the tyrannical Duke Felmet (Subhayan Sengupta). There is the Lady Macbeth-like duchess, brought to life by Diyasree Chattopadhyay, who eggs the duke on to crime.

 The play is set in Pratchetts Discworld. But the fantasy setting does not stop that world from having problems similar to the ones here. The play revolves around themes of authority, righteousness, intrigue, magic, power and sanctity. But all this is masked by the comic. We wanted to keep it light this time, says Kenneth.

 Duke Felmet, in true Macbeth-fashion, kills the former ruler of Lancre, and tries to rub off blood spots from his palms with a handkerchief throughout the play. If Macbeth gave himself away once during the banquet scene, Felmet does so a number of times. Apart from the murder, Felmet also instructs someone to kill the little prince but a soldier faithful to the late king manages to hand him over to the three witches. The three wyrd sisters are thus drawn into the scheme of things. They tell each other that they should not meddle but then the land wants them to.

 Thus, the popular ideas of good and bad are inverted. Witches are generally considered ugly and evil. Yet, they are the ones who save the situation here. The king, the guardian of the populace, is the one who terrorises them, burns down their cottages and goes to any extent to collect taxes, says Kenneth. The play punctuates scenes with the signature tune from the Hollywood film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. 

 There is also a play within the play at the end, a la Hamlet, where Tomjon, the late Dukes son plays the stage character of his father. The witches are a part of the audience but slip away before Felmets guards come to get them. In keeping with the mood of nonsense, the soldiers round up the artists playing the witches while the real weird sisters carry forward the play, as themselves. At this stage, the Duke gives himself away one last time and Tomjon is restored to his rightful throne.

 But theatre enthusiasts will not have another production from Jinx House for a while. Almost all of us are busy with our studies or careers. Some are leaving Calcutta to study. We will definitely arrange another show of Wyrd Sisters if invited. This time the play was staged mostly with money from our own pockets and in the final stages we got sponsorship from Tata Sky, said Kenneth, a political science graduate from St Xaviers College. He is currently a second year student of South and South East Asian Studies at Calcutta University.

 Know your rights

 The Peaceworks Human Rights Development Programme, an initiative of Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, organised a workshop on human rights from June 18 to 26 called In the Rights Direction. Conducted by lawyers Oishik Sircar and Debolina Dutta, the workshop dealt with issues on gender, sexuality, human rights, development and globalisation, through discussions, group activities, film screenings and interactive sessions. The duo has conducted a similar workshop at Pune. The purpose of the workshop was to equip young people to be human rights defenders on an individual level, explained Sircar. The reason behind choosing gender and sexuality as the focus of the workshop was to look at the way other issues like caste and economic conditions influence them.

 Films were screened between sessions. Anand Patwardhans 1978 documentary, Prisoners of Conscience, was about the treatment meted out to political prisoners during the Emergency. When Four Friends Meet dealt with the issue of violence and masculinity, spurring a debate on whether violence was limited to women, while Zinda Lash was about the stereotypes surrounding the representation of sex workers in Bollywood cinema.

 For the 20 participants, mostly college students, the workshop was useful in fleshing out issues they felt strongly about. Felt Deepti Jayakrishnan, a third-year law student at NUJS: We had read about the definition of rape in the Indian Penal Code. But I realised in the course of discussions here that we need to broaden the scope of the definition of rape to include the forcible insertion of a metallic object into the vagina. In such cases, usually an attempt to murder charge is slapped. 

 She added: We also met people from backgrounds different from ours. 

 Parthasarathy Chakravarty, who does documentation projects as a freelancer for NGOs and other organisations, said: As part of a sexual minority, my interest was subjective. Many of the subjects dealt with were familiar to him. It was the activities like body mapping (picture

 participants had to identify parts

 of the body most prone to shame,

 pleasure and pain, that were most

 enjoyable. Save our group, none dared to name the genital parts, remarked Deepti. 

 The workshop also shed light on attitudes we take for granted. We all support rights for homosexuals, but we realised while speaking that we often think in heterosexual terms, she explained. Heated debates ranged on topics questioning whether prostitution might be a personal choice. You might claim to be liberal but would you accept it if your daughter wanted to be a sex worker? wondered Priyanka Rao, also a student of NUJS. 

 The scope of the workshop could have been widened if the course fee had been less. Also, it would have helped if the medium of instruction had not been exclusively English, felt Parthasarathy.

 Baby boy abandoned

 - Couple deserted son because of parental pressure, poverty

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 12-day-old boy was abandoned by his parents in a Belghoria street-corner on Sunday night.

 Local residents, however, rescued the child and handed him over to police, who later sent him to a state-run home in Salt Lake.

 The parents Uma Das, 19, and Amit Das, 24 have been arrested. 

 Amit told the police his parents had made it clear that they would not let the child enter their Bisarpara home, in New Barrackpore, as Uma had been brought up in an orphanage.

 We were forced to abandon the baby, as I earn too little to afford living separately, said Amit, who works as a mason. He said his parents, especially his mother, never accepted Uma because of her background and also because they married without the parents consent.

 Uma, who delivered the child at NRS Medical College and Hospital by Caeserian section, said: I have requested the police to hand over my child to any good couple without a baby. There is no way we can raise him.

 She has been admitted to Sagar Dutta Hospital nearby, following some post-operative complications.

 Around 10pm on Sunday, some residents of Atul Chatterjee Street informed us that a baby had been found abandoned by the road, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 A team from Belghoria police station immediately went to the spot and rescued the baby. We sent him to a home for treatment, he added.

 Residents of the neighbourhood said they were alerted by the cries of the baby. 

 The area had plunged into darkness because of a power cut while I was returning home. But I could spot the tot wrapped in a towel in front of our house when the headlights of my car fell on him. As I came out of the car, a woman who lives near our house picked up the baby, said Sanjit Saha, a businessman.

 Local residents immediately gathered on the spot and started enquiring about the child. 

 An elderly woman said she had seen a girl in a red salwar-kameez, accompanied by a man, abandon the child a few minutes before.

 The youths of our locality fanned out in every direction and found the parents below Belghoria bridge. They broke down and admitted that they had abandoned the baby under duress, Saha said.

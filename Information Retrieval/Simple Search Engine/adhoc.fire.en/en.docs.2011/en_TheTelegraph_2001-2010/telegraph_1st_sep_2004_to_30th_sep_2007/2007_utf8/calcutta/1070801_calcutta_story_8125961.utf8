 Polluter tag on oil firms

 - High court panel showcauses 

companies for river offence

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A high court-appointed committee has charged oil companies having depots along the Hooghly with polluting the river.

 Officials of the central pollution control board who are on the panel, set up to monitor pollution of the river, have showcaused the oil companies for not possessing the infrastructure to dispose of the sludge accumulating inside the storage tanks.

 The Hooghly is polluted along this stretch, especially during monsoon, with sludge and oil being washed into the river following heavy showers. Each time the tanks are loaded and unloaded, some amount of fuel spills on to the ground. There is leakage even during the removal of sludge from storage to underground tanks, said environmental activist Subhas Dutta, a member of the committee.

 He stressed the need to clear the outflow channels to prevent stagnation of polluted water. The lockgate that opens on the riverfront is also defunct and the oil companies need to repair it as soon as possible. The companies have also been directed not to pour untreated effluents into the river, Dutta said.

 The eastern region head of the central pollution control board, S.S. Bala, observed that the oil companies Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum who have their terminals here should install the infrastructure to avoid environment hazards.

 The pollution of the river along the stretch is high as none of the oil separators that the companies have is functional. As a result, the contaminated water is not treated before it flows into the Hooghly. We have also asked the oil companies to carry out an environment-impact assessment and draw an environment management plan to prevent hazards, Bala said.

 The senior law officer in the state environment department, Biswajit Mukherjee, said the committee has also looked into the hazards that the residential complex of the oil companies in Budge Budge and the commercial area on the premises are facing.

 The oil firms have to repair the lockgate, clean the drainage system and put up the infrastructure to treat effluent water within 15 days, as the pollution is affecting more than 3,000 villagers in the vicinity, Mukherjee asserted.

 The committee, which will submit its report to the central board, is contemplating action against the oil companies under the Environment Protection Act, sources said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Old world in new tea cup 

 A tea-stop at Park Street where it is possible to get over nostalgia over old Flurys, reports Poulomi Banerjee

 Its six at Park Street on a rainy evening. Outside, a grey sky, breaking into a smart spell of shower every now and then, is giving way to a dark evening, lit by the gleaming Park Street lights.

 The entrance to T3, The Tea Table, is crowded. Inside the tea-shop is a warm gathering of people, a friendly hum of voices that hovers softly. Theres hardly an empty table, but theres no hurry. Guests take their time over coffee, a child runs to the pastry counter.

 T3, a sister concern of Flurys, started three years ago when the latter was closed for renovation, preserves the best of that charming old world. And more. 

 Here you can be yourself. All other restaurants and cafes are so imposing, says Soma Sen Gupta, the director of Sanhita, a womens organisation. I love the old furniture, she adds.

 Her companion Anindya Hajra, who is with an organisation that works with alternate sexual orientations, adds: I love the tables by the window. T3 has a very international feel to it and it is contemporary.

 A man in a pair of checked shorts walks up to a table. Many are regulars here, who expect to see each other, even if they dont talk. There are families, college students, couples who had once dated at Flurys, old-timers, office-goers, old Calcuttans, the arty, the creative and the odd celebrity.

 No one is made to feel old. Its a happy mix of all ages. I have been coming to Flurys since the 1940s. But after the renovation Flurys ceased to be a tea-shop. It became a restaurant. T3 is what Flurys used to be. Here you can just pause, unwind, and then move on, says S.M. Lath, the chairman of a steel company, as in a table behind him, some boys break into a boisterous Happy Birthday to You.

 Like Lath, the boys, Chiranjit Biswas, Arindam Bose, Ritesh Kumar Roy and Sukrit Saha, all engineering students, come to T3 at least thrice a week. They allow you to smoke here. The prices are reasonable, they chorus. 

 The older people feel alienated at Barista and Cafe Coffee Day. Thats not the case here, says Soma, as Mrs Kedia, down with her husband Raj Kedia, adds: My husband and I have been coming to Flurys since our college days, and we now find that old charm at T3. The old menu and the old taste is also a big draw for us.

 The nicest thing about T3, say its patrons, is that you can come here alone. Its one of those few places in town, where you can enjoy your cup of coffee alone, read your book, flip through a paper, or just sit and let your mind wander as you watch Park Street.

 A foreign tourist has been doing just that every evening for a year, informs cashier Arup Chatterjee, nodding at a man who occupies a table at the far end of the shop. A media person says she feels like writing the novel that will make her famous by one of the windows. 

 T3-goers also swear by the dcor rather, the lack of it. The stained white walls, high ceilings, naked fluorescent tubes, stark, white, chipped china, old furniture and paintings and sketches are reassuringly old-world.

 The patrons find it liberating. At another table, Suranjana Sen, who works in an airline, says: There have been days when I have been feeling low, and have confided in my friends here. I wouldnt have been able to open up if it had been any other place. The staff here is very discreet and if they see that you are having a conversation, they dont interrupt.

 Dishing it out: Brisk

 business on the pavement 

 Its unfortunate, but not the least bit surprising, that students of South Calcutta Law College were beaten up by train passengers in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (Molested on train, to and fro, April 5). 

 The harassment of bona fide passengers at the hands of unruly trespassers is common on trains passing through Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The torture is prolonged if the passengers do not speak Hindi. The incidents take place with the full knowledge of the travelling ticket examiners and the railway police. 

 Either the railways authorities are not serious about stopping this menace or are incapable of doing it. If the latter is true, the least the authorities can do (however outrageous it may sound) is to not stop long-distance trains in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. 

 Passengers do not pay through their noses to be beaten up by the residents of the railway ministers state. People devoid of a sense of decency, discipline and respect for the law of the land should be barred from taking trains. 

 Kajal Chatterjee,

 Apropos the report Myriad fare, eaters dare, March 29, the proliferation of eateries outside the states administrative headquarters is worrying. Especially since the majority of the city residents suffer from stomach ailments. Wide choice and low cost, however, help the eateries attract customers by the thousands. The food served is tasty but unhygienic. The way the cutlery is washed in dirty water makes one shudder. Those who frequent these eateries are risking long-term loss for short-term gains. The civic authorities should make alternative arrangements for office-goers. 

 P.B. Saha,

 Salt Lake. 

 It is undeniable that eateries on the footpath

 serve tasty fare at rock-bottom prices. If the civic body can make the

 owners of these eateries maintain the quality of the food, Calcuttans will

 benefit immensely.

Apropos the report Cop hands over jewellery, March 27, several instances of policemen showing exemplary honesty have been recently reported in the media. It is good to hear that traffic sergeant Jiban Kumar Dutta has returned a box containing jewellery worth Rs 25,000. I hope he is rewarded suitably. In October 2003, constable Ajit Guha found a bag containing more than Rs 1.25 lakh and handed it over to his superiors. To date, his act of honesty has not been recognised by the state government. 

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur.

 Apropos Cost accountant in gold shop raid net(March 29), it is a harsh truth that the young generations takes to crime to earn a quick buck to fund a reckless rollicking life. It is very difficult to find a remedy for the diseased society in this globalised world. Cops are to be more vigilant to nab the criminals. 

 G. Bakshi, 

 Budge Budge. 

 Apropos the report Exam system revamp cry, April 3, it is wonderful that St Xaviers College and the West Bengal College and University Teachers Association conducted a workshop to develop interactive teaching and ensure proper evaluation of answerscript and revision of syllabus. Teachers, students and administrators should put their heads together to improve educational standards. 

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

 I congratulate the schools that have started human rights courses (A study of rights, March 23). More steps should be taken to make people aware of their rights. The United Nations and other organisations promoting human rights need to take steps in this regard. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Beleghata. 

 The report Wife killed for ugliness, March 27, was shocking. It revealed the real face of a consumerist society. The murder of a 22-year-old for her looks raises questions about safety of women in India. The criminal should receive the harshest punishment. 

 Rathin Chatterjee, 

 Dum Dum.

 Apropos the report More coaches, March 28, it is good that Eastern Railway has added coaches to local trains from Howrah and Sealdah to ease the rush of commuters. On the Sealdah section, thousands board down trains from Majdia but have to face problems due to lack of a ticket counter on the down platform. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 How can the BC Roy Memorial Hospital authorities sit idle despite so many deaths (Child hospital stays mired in misery, April 3)? Dumping of garbage outside the building and encroachment of footpaths by hawkers highlight the mismanagement. The administrators are busy holding functions. Those who avail of the hospitals services cannot afford to go elsewhere. The government is responsible for providing them medical care. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder, 

 Behala.

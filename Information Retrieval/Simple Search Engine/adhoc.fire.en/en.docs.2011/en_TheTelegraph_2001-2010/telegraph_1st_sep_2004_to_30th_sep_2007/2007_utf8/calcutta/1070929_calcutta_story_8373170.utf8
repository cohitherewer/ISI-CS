 Todi kin grilled, clamour for CBI probe

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The CID on Friday questioned two members of the Ashok Todi family and two other men in connection with Rizwanur Rahmans death.

 The sleuths have also written to police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, asking for the names of the officers who allegedly counselled Rizwanur and his wife Priyanka to part ways. We will question the officers, said Bhupinder Singh, the additional director-general of the CID.

 The Todi family members who turned up at the CID headquarters for questioning were Pradip Todi, brother of Priyankas father Ashok, and Anil Saraogi, a relative.

 The statements of Ashok and Pradip do not match. The discrepancies will have to be sorted out, said Singh.

 Saraogi had signed a statement in Lalbazar stating that Priyanka would return to Rizwanur from her parental home within seven days. The Todis backed out on the promise.

 The other two men grilled were the driver and guard of a Sealdah-Burdwan local who spotted Rizwanurs body on the tracks near Bidhannagar. A clear picture will emerge after the viscera and the chemical analysis reports are received, said Singh.

 Adjourned: Calcutta High Court on Friday adjourned the hearing of the plea for a CBI probe, moved by Rizwanurs mother Kishwar Jahan, till September 3. The hearing will take place on September 3, said Justice Soumitra Pal.

 Ray demand: Former chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray welcomed the judicial probe into Rizwanurs death but demanded that the case be also referred to the CBI for an impartial inquiry.

 The government had violated the convention of announcing a judicial probe by not requesting the chief justice of the apex court or the high court to nominate a retired judge to conduct the inquiry, said Ray, who has sent a letter to the chief minister raising 15 questions.

 The CBI should be asked to carry out the probe instead of the CID, as the police commissioner and other senior officers are involved in the case, added Ray, who offered to fight for Rizwanurs family in court for free. The guilty officers should be suspended without delay.

 The minority cell of the state Congress wrote to the Prime Minister on Friday, asking for a CBI probe. Its difficult for the CID to grill the police commissioner and other senior officers, said party leader Abdul Mannan.

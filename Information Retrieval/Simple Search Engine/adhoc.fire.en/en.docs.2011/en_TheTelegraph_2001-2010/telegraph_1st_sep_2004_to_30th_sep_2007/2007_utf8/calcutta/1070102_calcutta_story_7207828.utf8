 Play of ideas

 A pioneer of British feminist theatre and one of the most distinguished women dramatists in the UK, Caryl Churchill strongly believes that drama should uncover new worlds beyond and beneath the surface of ordinary life. Her major plays have always proven true her own dictum. Experimenting with form and breaking conventional expectations of theatre, her plays offer fresh perspective and subtle insight into facets of life that lay hidden in casual, everyday perception. Written by her during Thatcherite times, Top Girls is a contemporary classic, which remains relevant to this day. Presenting political and personal ideologies, it is a play that deals with the choices and decisions that modern young people have to contend with along lifes journey. Turning time topsy-turvy, it provides a surreal experience, yet is intensely realistic in its use of Churchills stylistic invention of overlapping dialogue. Direction: Ananda Lal.

 Event: Play in English, Top Girls, produced by Theatrecian amp; Jadavpur University Department of English 

When: Today at 6.30 pm

 Lessons in dhuti punjabi

 Schools are known to impose dress codes on women teachers and enough words have been spent on the salwar kurta vs sari debate. But a dress code for the mastar-moshai? 

 At least one school has done that. Pallishri School, Joynagar, Howrah, a co-ed higher secondary school, makes it mandatory for its male teachers to wear white dhutipunjabi in the classrooms. But there are many young teachers who dont wear dhoti outside. So they reach school wearing trousers and shirts, but have to change into dhoti-kurta even before they sign the attendance register! The dhoti-kurta sets are kept in an almirah at the school. 

 But the good thing is that the prescription is not to score a moral point about decent dressing. Its just a tradition thats being kept alive, the school says.

 Weak cast

Nostalgia can be noxious, particularly when it dredges up what it deems to be the past and distorts it beyond recognition. Unfortunately, Calcutta has become a victim of such nostalgia. It happened when the director of a Bollywood film based on a Saratchandra classic tried to resurrect Park Street of the 1960s complete with a crooner who sang a Louis Armstrong classic in Hindi, of course. And it is happening every time somebody is trying to revive what he thinks is a retro design with disastrous results.

 First the Chowringhee flyover rode roughshod over what should have been a heritage precinct. To add insult to injury, this stretch of the road at its crossing with Park Street was adorned with stunted lamp posts with ornamental tops coiled like jalebis which supposedly were lookalikes of the cast iron classics one sees only in photographs today. In a few years, many of the globes which hung from them have shattered and the naked bulbs stand exposed.

 Similar rickety cast iron rails and gates have been put up all around the Victoria Memorial Hall greens and Citizens Park. Such nostalgia will not survive the future.

 Church park 

 Dalhousie Square, through which hundreds and thousands of cars, buses and other vehicles race at all hours of the day, is one of the most polluted zones in the city. St Johns church is in the heart of it all and has over the years borne the brunt of the toxic fumes that form a pall visible from a distance. While it is heartening to know that the church faade will soon be cleaned up, why have the grounds been allowed to be turned into a sprawling parking lot? How could the Calcutta Municipal Corporation give permission, if permission was sought at all?

 This is the oldest surviving church of the city and it should be allowed to breathe free. The church possesses a rare work of art. One can walk into it to catch a glimpse of perhaps the citys oldest oil painting on canvas Johann Zoffanys Last Supper. Heavy petrol and diesel fumes are not exactly what a conservationist would prescribe for the well being of this work with rich colours. It was last restored a long time ago and deserves as much protection as the church itself.

 The cure-all

 The city has seen the appearance of yet another cure-all, an extract from the fruits of a medicinal plant called Morinda Citrifolia. Challenges faced by our body daily, lists the leaflet on the juice, are pollution, soil depletion, chemical farming, poor hygiene, modern lifestyle. Net result is stress-low energy-diseases-loss of good health. The only way out is detoxification. Apparently the juice does that and more. It detoxifies our body, works as an anti-oxidant, works at the cellular level, works at the root of illness, purifies blood, regulates proper cell function, regenerates damaged cells, strengthens our immune system, reduces pain without side effects, promotes the self-healing mechanism of out body. It supports the immune system, the circulatory system, the digestive system, the metabolic system, skin, hair and scalp. It also helps people with diabetes, digestive disorders, arthritis, asthma, heart disease, high cholesterol, high/low blood pressure, cancer, HIV, chronic pain, depression, kidney problem, TB, menstrual disorders, weight management, stroke, stress and sleeping disorders! Oops, did we leave anything out? Maybe, only common cold and toothache. 

 Not surprisingly, its being sold by a firm called Elixir Enterprises.

 Court frown on fake PILs

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 

 Calcutta High Court has asked police to enquire into petitioners filing fictitious public interest litigations (PIL) in court for their personal gains.

 A division bench of Justice B. Bhattacharya and Justice K.K. Prasad passed the order after going through a report submitted by the detective department.

 Last September, a PIL was filed by a few Maniktala residents, alleging that a local petrol pump-owner was supplying adulterated petrol. They demanded penal action against the owner. 

 On the basis of the PIL, a division bench, headed by former Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar, issued an order directing the oil company to file an affidavit against the owner.

 When the matter came up for second hearing, eight persons, excluding the first petitioner, Ram Awadh Singh, informed the court that they didnt know Singh nor they had filed any PIL. They alleged that their names were falsely implicated in the case. 

 Following the statement by the petitioners, the court directed police to look into the matter. 

 The anti-rowdy department, in its report, said Benugopal Jhunjhunwala, proprietor of Jagadish Auto Service and Abhisekh Tour and Travels, had filed the fictitious PIL in the name of Ram Awadh Singh and others, out of business rivalry.

 Appearing for police, junior standing counsel Subrata Mukhopadhya said Jhunjhunwalas counsel had refused to cooperate in the investigation. 

 The court asked the detective department to follow-up the inquiry.

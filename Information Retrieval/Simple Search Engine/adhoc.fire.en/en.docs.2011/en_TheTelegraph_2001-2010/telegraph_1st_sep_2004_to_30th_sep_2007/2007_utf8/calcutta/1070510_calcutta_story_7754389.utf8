 Modelled masterpieces

 A noted figure in the Indian art scene for nearly a quarter of a century, Sankho Chaudhuri has played a significant role in the efflorescence of the modern, realistic and representative style of Indian sculpture. Hosted by The Seagull Foundation for the Arts, the ongoing exhibition of his works amply highlights the reasons for his pre-eminence as a master sculptor. Both a monumental sculptor and a portrait artist, the pervading traits of his works are quite individual and, perhaps, in antithesis to that of his teacher Ramkinkar Baijs expressionist ebullience. An indefatigable experimenter, Chaudhuri has worked with all basic media: wood, stone, bronze, welded metal plasters, to name a few. His portraits reveal a mannered romanticism, which makes them more than mere physiognomic documents; he de-personalises them and turns them into cult figures, thus investing them with more enduring value.

 Event: An exhibition of sculptures by Sankho Chaudhuri When: Till May 12; 2 pm - 7 pm Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P. Mukherjee Road

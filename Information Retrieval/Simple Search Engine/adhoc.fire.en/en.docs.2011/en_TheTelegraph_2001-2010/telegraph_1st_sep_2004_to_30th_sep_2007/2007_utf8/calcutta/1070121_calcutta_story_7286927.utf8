The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tongue twister 

 From anger to admiration, food to fun, we need English terms and phrases to express ourselves best

 From anger to admiration, food to fun, we need English terms and phrases to express ourselves best

 Conversation in an auto between father and daughter. Daughter: Which way do we go?

 Father: Baan deekey.

 Daughter: Kon dikey?

 Father: Left.

 Daughter: Oh!

 Of late, some words are vanishing fast from everyday Bengali (and Hindi and Marathi and all other Indian languages), not able to survive the onslaught of English.

 We will stand up and observe a minute of silence for the words that are already gone, but with them well also try to list words that look endangered now, yet are not extinct.

 Reliable sources tell us that someone is ready to start a movement called Stop The Urban Peoples Inclination to Drop-their-mothers-tongues (STUPID).

 The words that are disappearing are important words. In Calcutta, left and right look set to signal a new direction, with many children of educated young Bengalis not being able to tell their daan from their baan. In Mumbai, daina and baanya have disappeared from the street. If you shout baanya to an auto driver (called a rickshaw driver there), he is likely to keep driving straight. Then you know you have to scream Laft, laft, and he will nod appreciatively.

 In Calcutta, eating has also changed forever. When is the last time you were invited to a dupurer or ratrer khabar? But you have certainly been to several lunches and dinners and had them at your place, too.

 Eating has changed and so has the menu at Bengali weddings, too. Not many can ask for bhaat, even if plain rice is there on the menu. You are expected to ask for rice. When the uniformed person serving pulao appears in front of you and thrusts the rice spoon under your nose, he asks: Rice?

 Once at a marriage party, a friend asked for shaada bhaat (plain rice). But the dish seemed to be a new one for those who were serving, says lexicographer Ashoke Mukhopadhyay. 

 Bhaat is still had at home. But not the practice of asking someone who dropped in at lunch hour Bhaat kheye jao. With or without murgir manghsho. Try to recall the last time you had a murgir jhol, if it was not at an upmarket Bengali cuisine restaurant. Otherwise you have had only Chicken.

 The goat has fared better. When you are coming out of a wedding, you are likely to be asked: Chicken chhilo, na pantha (Was it chicken, or mutton?) You have to ignore the fact that Bengalis like to call goatmeat mutton (rather motton), but not so much as they like to call murgi chicken. 

 An activity that is the logical conclusion of eating has also changed. Educated Bengalis, at least in polite society, hardly use a Bengali verb to describe their morning act. They potty. Their children also potty.

 Mixed media 

 Children these days learn the first word in English. They learn red and not laal, says Mukhopadhyay, who has compiled the first Bengali thesaurus. The trend was always there, but it has boomed over the past few years.

 Using English, he says, is still a sign of being educated, and its a trend not only popular among elite Bengalis, but also in the lower strata of the society. So phrases like mutual kore nebo.

 Mukhopadhyay feels when we have to stress on something we have the tendency to use English. Get out is a stronger version of beriye jao. The trend to use more English has increased in about the last decade or so. FM channels and television had an important role to play. The language that is used in the media is a mixed one. Even the language in newspapers has changed.

 And globalisation must be exerting its influence somewhere. Mukhopadhyay points some words hounded out by English: Fitness, foreign goods, market, forgery, plus point, taste, decision, garbage, discount, actually, top korechhe.

 In Hindi, letter, socks, pillow, star/stars, rose, prayers, exam/ test, dog or doggy, cat, horse, goat, pigeon and parrot have replaced their vernacular originals. Not to mention thank you, sorry, madam and sir, which has been transmitted into Indian languages since time immemorial. 

 Total timepass

 But the biggest register of change is the vocabulary of GeneratioNext. Just spend an hour at City Centre, sitting on the steps. Sit with a book. Even if you get engrossed in it, you will be hit by these every five minutes or so: Oh no, maybe, forget it, whatever, chill, just chill, Im chilling at City Centre, crazy, never mind, come on, sure, probably, immediately, rubbish, awesome, horrible, get together, really, fine, simple, beautiful, very nice, bloody hell, get lost.

 This was actually what a pretty young thing, Bengali, told her boyfriend, at the other end of the mobile phone, sitting on the City Centre steps. She also asked the boyfriend not to be hyper.

 The trend continues unabated. The age-old Bengali endearment idiot like the words nonsense and cadaverous has gone, long dead, and has been replaced by donkey. 

 Some English words have the potency to replace other cool words. The word deadly can replace the campus-topper byapok any day. Deadly also makes hebby (heavy, meaning great) look passe. Similarly, the more basic sex has replaced sexy. Example: Cinema ta total sex.

 And everything is Timepass. Obviously, and thats also a Bengali word now.

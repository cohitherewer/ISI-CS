 The road ahead: A traffic

 constable gives a rickshaw-puller the right of way 

 Apropos the report Father fells teen champ, January 9, Biswadeep Bhattacharya paid with his life for failing to live up to his father Deepaks expectations. 

 Failure and success are both part of life. When someone is down, guidance from near and dear ones can work miracles. Deepak, instead, chose to beat up his son if he lost a game. 

 No sportsman, from Boris Becker to Shane Warne to Prakash Padukone, was born a legend. Who knows if they showed promise as children? But they could certainly not become what they are if they had fathers like Biswadeeps. 

 Its not true that only practice makes a champion. Jograj Singh, father of Yuvraj Singh, was as talented as his state-mate Kapil Dev, but it is said he did not blossom due to excessive practice. Coach Syed Nayeemuddin is a stickler for discipline. His son Fazaluddin should have become the greatest Indian tennis player if practice was all that mattered. Such examples should serve as warning for parents. 

 Arindam Basu,

 Birati. 

 Apropos the report Puja reprieve for rickshaw-puller, January 10, the mayors decision to not enforce a ban on hand-pulled rickshaws, in the absence of a rehabilitation package, at least till Puja 2007, is laudable. The chief minister, on the other hand, seems bent on evicting rickshaw-pullers from the city. 

 Hand-pulled rickshaws are a part of Calcuttas heritage and culture, and are also an essential mode of transport, especially in the lanes and bylanes of north Calcutta. Rickshaw-pullers often serve as saviours for schoolchildren, women and the aged stranded on flooded roads during monsoon. The state government should allow rickshaws to ply at least in lanes away from the main roads. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road. 

 It is a wise decision on the part of the mayor

 to stall the ban on hand-pulled rickshaws. The vehicle is part of the citys

 history and plays an important role in ferrying people during waterlogging. 

 Sukumar Ghosh, 

 Mukundapur. 

 Hand-pulled rickshaws, it is being said, are

 a inhuman mode of transport and hence should be banned. But they were always

 inhuman modes of transport. Just because the authorities have woken up

 to their inhumanity after so many years, the vehicle should not be banned

 without arranging for rehabilitation of the people who depend on them for

 their livelihood. Also, rickshaws are essential modes of transport in many

 parts of the city. 

 Moumita Sengupta,

 Behala. 

 Apropos the report Gandhi gets to say sorry, January 9, the governors apology to rickshaw-puller Mohammad Yunus speaks volumes about his values. Each one of us, irrespective of our status in society, is entitled to dignity and respect. But few honour the right. Gopalkrishna Gandhi did not with mere words, but by his deed. If the rest of us imbibe his values, the society would be a much better place to live in. 

 Kajal Chatterjee, 

 Sodepur. 

 It is heartening that Gopalkrishna Gandhi invited

 a rickshaw-puller to Raj Bhavan to apologise to him. The governor has followed

 in the footsteps of his grandfather Mahatma Gandhi. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 The governor made all of us proud by inviting

 a rickshaw-puller to Raj Bhavan and apologising to him for being beaten

 up by his over-zealous minders. Kudos for highlighting the incident. 

 B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park. 

 The governors gesture is wonderful and worthy of Mahatma Gandhis

 grandson. But what about the babus who precipitate this mindset of the

 lawmen? 

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake. 

 The governor has set a wonderful example. Most

 of us, especially those in the administration, generally pay no respect

 to the downtrodden. They are generally blamed if something goes wrong,

 even if someone else is responsible. Its high time for the attitude to

 change. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

 Behala.

 Apropos the report New jatra address, January 10, even today jatra is very popular in rural Bengal. Of late, it has improved in terms of music, lighting, sound and performance. It is good to see the chief minister standing up for this form of performing art. 

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

Apropos Baggage loss bane of air travel, January 3, regarding delay in receiving airline baggage and loss of certain items, the matters have been settled with Air India (on January 17) and British Airways (on January 24). I am satisfied with the action taken. 

 Pranab Sen,

 Address not given. 

 The barge cruise organised by International Club is on March 3, and not on March 4, as was published in Social Register on February 25.

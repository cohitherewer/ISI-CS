The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Scam in 9/11 name 

 PRONAB MONDAL 

 Email alert: The 9/11 Twin Towers attack 

 Internet scamsters from Africa are now pretending to be Interpol agents to dupe people. They are sending emails to people around the globe, including Calcutta, seeking help to transfer money through a legal and highly protected method.

 The emails have prompted Interpol to issue a caution notice stating that the agency does not send mails to the public and is in no way involved with money transfer.

 The notice states: Please note that Interpol does not send emails to people.... If you receive an email from someone claiming to be an Interpol agent asking you to transfer money to an account, or saying that the agency is required to intervene in any large sums of money being transferred, treat it as a fake message. Any requests through an email address that does not end with interpol.int should also be considered as fraudulent.

 The agency also warns people against disclosing their bank account details.

 Emails from African countries like Nigeria and Ghana claiming access to the bank account of a billionaire who died either in the 9/11 attack or an accident and seeking the recipients help to transfer the money to a foreign bank account for a handsome commission are common. The target is asked to open a special bank account, where the money will be transferred.

 The next phase of the fraud is convincing the target that the money transfer is in progress. Forged documents on government letterhead, letters of credit, payment schedules and bank drafts are sent. The scamsters also start interacting with the target over the phone and through other means.

 The scamsters then claim that the process cannot be completed without offering bank and government officials a bribe. The target is asked to send money. Lured by the prospect of a huge commission, many easily fall into the trap. 

 About a half a dozen people from in and around the city have sent amounts ranging between Rs 70,000 and Rs 5 lakh to the scamsters. We were surprised to know that educated people, including a professor of IIT Kharagpur and an engineer from Salt Lake, have been duped, said Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner (detective department).

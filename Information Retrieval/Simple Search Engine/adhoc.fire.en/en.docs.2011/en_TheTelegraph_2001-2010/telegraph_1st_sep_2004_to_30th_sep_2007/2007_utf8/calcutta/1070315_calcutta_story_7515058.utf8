 Gender and identity

 Films have long served as an important platform for the awareness and discussion of problems related to women. Organised by International Women Film Festival Society of India in association with Eisenstein Cine Club, Calcutta, Women Behind the Camera: Look Back - 2nd India International Women Film Festival, the ongoing festival of award-winning films by women film-makers, attempts to address issues on gender discrimination, besides encouraging the role of women in the world of cinema. Among the films to be screened today is Unveiled (3 pm; a still from the film appears right). Directed by Angelina Maccarone, Germany, it narrates the story of Fariba, an Iranian woman who is forced to flee her homeland due to her preference for the same sex. She goes to Germany, takes on the identity of a dead countryman and submits herself to exile; at an external level, as a refugee and at an internal level, as a woman pretending to be a man. Later, she arouses the interest of a young woman who feels attracted towards the introvert man. Also being screened today: Sleeping Child (dir: Yasmine Kassari; Belgium) at 5 pm; The Kind Faces Woman (dir: Busi Cortes; Mexico) at 7 pm.

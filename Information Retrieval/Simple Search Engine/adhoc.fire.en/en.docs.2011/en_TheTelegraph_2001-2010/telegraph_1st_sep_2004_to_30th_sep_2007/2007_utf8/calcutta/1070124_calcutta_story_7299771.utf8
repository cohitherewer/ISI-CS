 The citys showpiece expressway, which leads to the airport from the EM Bypass through New Town, is now a happy hunting ground for carjackers. At least six complaints of car-snatching from the stretch have been lodged with Rajarhat police station in the past two months.

 In one incident, the driver was strangled to death and the body dumped near Bally bridge.

 Investigations by the local police and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) have revealed that the carjackers are fleeing with the vehicles to Bihar and Jharkhand, infamous for their thriving grey market of stolen cars.

 The murder of the driver took place on January 16. An agency near Paharpur, on Diamond Harbour Road, had sent a red Maruti Esteem to fetch two Korean business representatives from the airport.

 The driver, Sanjay Kumar Rao, left the agencys office around 5.15 pm. The flight was scheduled to arrive at 6.50 pm. Around 7 pm, our clients informed us that the car had not reached the airport and that they had to hire a taxi, said an employee of the agency.

 The agency authorities sensed something was wrong when their attempts to contact the driver proved futile. We could not speak to Rao, as his cellphone was switched off. We then went to Alipore police station and from there were directed to Rajarhat thana, the employee said. But neither could the driver be contacted nor the car located.

 The agency learnt about the murder the next day, when Bally police station approached a tailor in the Paharpur area. We found a tailors tag on the victims pocket and contacted the shop. It proved effective because the tailor confirmed that a man from his locality had been missing since the previous night, said an officer of Bally thana.

 Following the post-mortem, police came to know that Rao was strangled with the seat belt of the car. The killers then headed for Delhi Road and dumped the body after crossing Bally bridge.

 Elaborating on the modus operandi of the carjackers, an officer of Rajarhat police station said: Our investigations revealed that in most cases, the carjackers forced the drivers to stop by putting obstructions on the road. Besides, there are two dangerous turns on this 13-km stretch, where the drivers have to slow down.

 Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas), said the criminals were mostly outsiders, with links with those dealing in stolen vehicles in Bihar and Jharkhand.

 Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department), said: Officers of the anti-motor theft wing recently conducted several raids in the two neighbouring states and recovered more than a dozen cars stolen from the city and its fringes.

 A couple of months ago, a team from the CID arrested a gang of hijackers heading for Jharkhand in a stolen Sumo.

 Kumar said vigil on the thoroughfare would be intensified shortly. Policemen will be provided with more vehicles to keep a close watch on the stretch. Besides, there will high-speed vehicles to effectively chase the criminals.

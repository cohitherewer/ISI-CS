 Salt Lake plot transfer ruling

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The high court has reiterated an earlier ruling on plot transfers in Salt Lake and held that plot-holders in the township can transfer property through transfer mutation, if the lease agreement permitted it. 

 Justice D. Kargupta on Thursday passed the order on a petition by Shankar Chowdhury and others. The petitioners complained they could not transfer land due to a change in the lease clause after 1980. 

 Government pleader Sovanlal Hazra, said: The ruling is not new. Earlier too, the court had held that plots can be transferred if the lease agreement permits.

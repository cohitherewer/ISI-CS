 Stopping at the Traffic Signal

 Page 3, Corporate and now Traffic Signal. Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar completes his trilogy with this one. Ready to release on February 2, Traffic Signal is a dark, real film that boasts of grim humour. Get a feel of life and business at Mumbais traffic signals, inspired by the directors walks to Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai. A must-watch is, of course, Konkona Sen Sharma, the reluctant prostitute.

 Zeroing in on your Valentine 

 There are Valentines and then there are Valentines. The problem could be of too many or too few. Whatever may be the case, with February 14 coming up in just over a fortnight, its time you started giving the V-matter some serious thought. Busy playing the field? We suggest you get your act together and try and pinpoint your potential sweetheart and dedicate the day to her. Bubbly, bouquets, the works 

 Bringing home petal power

 Give your home an instant spring makeover. Stop by at your local florist and pick up some seasonal blooms to give your house a breezy look. Choose colours in contrast with the decor of your interiors so that the flowers stand out even more. Bunch them up casually or simply stick a single stem in a tall vase to form a focal nook by the window. Gerberas, roses, tuberoses, dahlias Pretty petals at this time of the year are countless.

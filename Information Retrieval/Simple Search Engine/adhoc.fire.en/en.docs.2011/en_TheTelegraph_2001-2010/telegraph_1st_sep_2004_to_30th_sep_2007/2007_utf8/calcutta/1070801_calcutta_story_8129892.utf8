 Awareness drive on breast cancer

 A STAFF REPORTER

 More than 700 women in the city are diagnosed with breast cancer each year. Of every 100 women diagnosed with cancer in Calcutta, 25 suffer from breast cancer. Most of these women are between 30 and 44 years of age.

 These are the findings of the Population Based Cancer Registry of Calcutta, which collects information about cancer cases from various places in the city.

 The findings clearly reflect that breast cancer is fast becoming a leading cause of death in the developing world. 

 The Cancer Foundation of India, a Calcutta-based non-government organisation, is embarking on a campaign to systematically educate Calcutta women in the age group of 18-25 on the benefits of breast self-examination as a measure for early detection of cancer.

 We are trying to stress the importance of regular examination of the breast. The initiative will teach young women to observe any abnormality in their breasts relatively early and seek clinical consultation immediately, said Sutapa Biswas, the executive director of the foundation.

 The awareness programme would be starting under the Women in Pink campaign, added Biswas. Through this campaign, the foundation intends to educate 2,000 young women in the first year and follow up their cases.

 We will try to empower these women to make an informed choice. The campaign begins with a health awareness survey followed by lessons from experts on various aspects of breast cancer, stated Sengupta.

 The Women in Pink campaign is designed mainly for educational institutions. The foundation would attempt to bring together the members of the Women in Pink group on a regular basis and provide them the opportunity to interact through meetings, seminars and innovative breast cancer education programmes.

 The programme kicks off on August 1 at St Thomas College of Engineering. 

 For breast examination by trained professionals, the foundation is also planning to start an exclusive Breast Examination Clinic. All members of the Women in Pink group will have access to our clinical consultants by appointment, added the foundation director.

 Cops caught in tease act

 - Lewd remark rap for sergeant, sub-inspector in port area

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Two cops from the Ekbalpore police station were transferred last week for their alleged involvement in a harassment case in the port area.

 A preliminary probe revealed that Tom Sarkar, a traffic sergeant, who was accompanied by sub-inspector Atanu Tarafdar, had passed lewd remarks at a 24-year-old woman on August 4, on Mayurbhanj Road in Mominpore.

 Trouble broke out when some local youths accused the sergeant of teasing the woman and then slapped him.

 The next day, police arrested Ashok, one of the youths who had confronted the sergeant, on charges of rowdyism.

 This caused severe resentment among residents of the area. Highlighting the incident and accusing the two policemen of first harassing a woman and then persecuting a youth who had protested, they dashed off letters to senior police officers at Lalbazar. An inquiry was ordered.

 There was a complaint of eve-teasing against the sergeant and the sub-inspector tried to shield him. Transfer orders against both of them have already been issued. A departmental inquiry is on to ascertain what exactly had happened that day, Anand Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police (port), told Metro on Monday.

 Sarkar was handed his transfer order on August 29 while Tarafdar was given his the following day.

 For the time being they have been transferred and officers have been asked to speak to witnesses and others in the locality. They will also speak to the young woman named in the complaint. Stern action will be taken against the two if they are found guilty, said a senior officer at Lalbazar.

 Around 7pm on August 4, when the young woman was returning home, Sarkar and Tarafdar were standing near a petrol pump. Scared by Sarkars remarks, the girl ran towards a group of local youths and sought their help.

 The youths arrived at the spot and confronted the two cops. When the sergeant refused to admit to his crime, Ashok slapped him.

 Sarkar and Tarafdar then beat a hasty retreat. But the next day, Ashok was picked up on charges of rowdyism. He is now out on bail.

 Instead of Ashok, the police should arrest the sergeant. We had to approach his superior officers to seek justice, said Naushad Ali, a resident of the area.

 Policemen are now turning harassers. They should be given exemplary punishment, said Shahid Reza, a resident of Ekbalpore.

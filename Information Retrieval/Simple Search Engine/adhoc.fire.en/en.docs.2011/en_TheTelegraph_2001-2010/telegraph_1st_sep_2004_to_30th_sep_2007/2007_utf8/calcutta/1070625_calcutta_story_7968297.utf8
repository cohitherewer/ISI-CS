 Police have decided to make the rules of organising soirees in the city more stringent, following the Hope-2007 fiasco.

 Salman Khan and Dia Mirza were supposed to perform at the Netaji Indoor Stadium event on Saturday but did not as they had not been paid.

 Gautam Chatterjee, Uttam Kundu, Ashoke Panja and Pronab Dey of Flash Forward Communications, which organised the event, were arrested. They were freed on bail on Sunday.

 By questioning the four, the police have found out about the working of companies like theirs. These outfits try to lure prospective investors with the promise of high returns against a small one-time investment, said an officer of the detective department. The officials claim the return will be between 75 and 100 per cent for an investment of around Rs 10 lakh in a Rs 65-75-lakh show. 

 He added: The real show starts once the first instalment of the investment is made. The companies try to pull a fast one on everyone.

 According to the police, the companies first approach managers of Bollywood stars for dates and then try to convince companies to sponsor the show. The organisers hide key expenses like airfare, publicity and hotel costs. When they cant raise enough money, they call off the show. 

 A number of shows have been called off in the past two years, including one by Sonu Nigam at Netaji Indoor Stadium in January 2006. Soon after, Sunidhi Chauhans show at the same venue was cancelled.

 In September last year, a show featuring Sunidhi Chauhan and KK, organised by the arrested four, at Barabati Stadium in Cuttack, was called off. In January this year, a show by band Euphoria at Rabindra Sarobar Stadium was called off at the last moment.

 The organisers of cultural programmes will have to follow certain regulations. They will have to spell out in their application to us the type of event being organised, the stars scheduled to turn up and the arrangements made, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee.

 Besides, the even managers will have to produce final consent letters from the artistes in the line-up at least 72 hours in advance and provide details of the places from where the tickets will be sold.

 In case of problems, the police will penalise the event management company and even the outlets from where the tickets for the show had been sold.

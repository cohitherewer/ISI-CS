 JEE as usual in 2008

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Students will be admitted to engineering and medical colleges in 2008 on the basis of the joint entrance examination (JEE), the state higher education minister, Sudarshan Ray Chowdhuri, said on Friday.

 The state government had been thinking of scrapping the JEE, following a scam involving dummy candidates. Also under consideration was a proposal to revamp the examination system to make it foolproof. 

 The JEE will be held as usual in 2008. But a number of academic changes will have to be introduced in the examination. The JEE board will decide on the changes, said Ray Chowdhuri.

 The minister said this after attending a seminar organised by Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu), Shibpur, to press for its upgrade to an Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST).

 He, however, did not rule out the possibility of doing away with the JEE after 2008. 

 The government had recently sent a team of officials of the higher education department to Tamil Nadu, where students are admitted to engineering and medical courses on the basis of their Class XII marks. The team was to examine whether the system could be adopted here.

 According to the minister, discussions are on to bring about administrative changes in the JEE board. A proposal to set up separate boards for engineering and medical entrance examinations is under consideration. 

 The JEE board will hold a meeting on September 11 to discuss ways to make the examination foolproof. 

 On the upgrade, the minister said: The Centre is likely to table a bill in Parliament in the winter session. The bill will have to be passed to formalise the upgrade of Besu and four other institutes to IIESTs, as recommended by the Anandakrishnan Committee.

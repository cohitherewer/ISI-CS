The KBC effect

Screen On amp; Off

 Less than a couple of weeks to go for Shah Rukh Khan to take over as the new host of Kaun Banega Crorepati and TV programming has started to change in a big way.

 First up, STAR Plus is shifting its 9 pm programmes from Monday to Thursday and keeping the KBC slot clear from January 22.

 So, from that Monday, Ravi Chopras Viraasat starring Rohit Roy and Sangeeta Ghosh (picture above) will move to STAR One, 8.30 pm.

 And the Balaji serial Karam Apnaa Apnaa, which was initially set in Calcutta, will move to the 8 pm slot on STAR Plus from January 22.

 Interestingly, both Karam Apnaa Apnaa and Viraasat are still doing very well and these are changes forced only by the return of KBC.

 According to the latest TAM Ratings for Week 52 of 2006, Karam Apnaa Apnaa has fetched a 7.37 with all four episodes of the week crossing the 7-TVR mark.

 That makes it 35 per cent higher than Zee TVs Saath Phere on a Monday-to-Thursday scale.

 As for Viraasat, the fighting families saga has also touched its highest rating with a 5.53 average TVR rating for the last week of 2006.

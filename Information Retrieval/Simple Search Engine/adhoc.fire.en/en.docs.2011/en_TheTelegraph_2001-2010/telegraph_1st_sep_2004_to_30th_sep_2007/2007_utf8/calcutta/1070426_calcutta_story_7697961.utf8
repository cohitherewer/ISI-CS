The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Deed fraud lands con duo in jail 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A duo took a con job too far and landed in the police net on Tuesday. 

 The men, in their 30s, dropped in at businessman Arvind Jaiswals Camac Street flat and offered him Rs 2 crore to clear out of a neighbourhood plot that Jaiswal knew as his own. Naba Kumar Manna, who claimed to be a lawyer, and Deb Ranjan Khan even threatened to throw the businessman out of the flat and murder him.

 The duo produced a fake deed that described Jaiswal as caretaker of the plot. The businessman called in the police. A team arrived from Shakespeare Sarani police station and took the two into custody. They were later arrested.

 The men asked me what I intended to do with the plot at 18/1 Camac Street. When I asked them who they were, they claimed that I was the caretaker of the plot and offered me Rs 2 crore to clear out. I was shocked, since I had inherited the plot, Jaiswal told Metro.

 Spread over 14.5 cottah, the plot was bought by Rukmini Sewak Jaiswal and his brother Mongol Prasad Jaiswal in 1959. Following their deaths and subsequent legal proceedings, Arvind, son of Rukmini Sewak, became the owner of the plot in 1979. It has been lying vacant. 

 According to the police, Manna and Khan made a fake deed stating that the plot belonged to Prasanna Kumar Chaudhury of Burdwan. The two showed the plot to a number of prospective buyers, quoting almost half its market price of about Rs 15 crore. 

 The deed described Arvind Jaiswal as the son of Rukmini and Mongol Prasad. It also stated that he was the caretaker of the plot. Armed with the document, the con men tried to make Arvind give up the plot, said Hiren Das, officer-in-charge of Shakespeare Sarani police station. 

 The fake deed had no resemblance to the original. The area of the plot was mentioned as 22 cottah in the fake document.

 The duo was produced in a city court on Wednesday and remanded in police custody till May 3. They had duped several people by acting as agents of a fictitious owner of the plot, said the investigating officers.

 The police have not ruled out the possibility of Manna and Khan being part of a racket. Well need time to trace their accomplices, if any, said an officer.

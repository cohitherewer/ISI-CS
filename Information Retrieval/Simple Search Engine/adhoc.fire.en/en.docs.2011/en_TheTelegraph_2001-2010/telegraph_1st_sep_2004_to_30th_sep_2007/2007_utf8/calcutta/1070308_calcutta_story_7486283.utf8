The autopsy has confirmed what Rit Chatterjees family had suspected that the 24-year-old housewife had been murdered at her in-laws residence in Shibpur, Howrah, on Saturday. 

 We are convinced that the girl was strangled to death. She had tried her best to resist the killer. We will submit the autopsy report to police tomorrow, said the surgeon who conducted the autopsy on Wednesday. 

 Rit, a bright student and a promising singer, married Arindam Banerjee, a mechanical engineer, last December after a three-year courtship. 

 I was told that my daughter had committed suicide, but I was not convinced, said Rits father Gautam Chatterjee, who filed a complaint with Shibpur police station on Monday. According to him, his daughters death was made to look like a suicide. 

 Late on Monday, Arindam, his father Asim and uncle Asish were arrested on charges of torturing Rit and forcing her to commit suicide. On Tuesday, the trio was produced in the chief judicial magistrates court in Howrah and remanded in judicial custody for 15 days. 

 Arindams mother Ashoka and aunt Soma, who are also accused in the case, are absconding. 

 The Banerjees have been living here for nearly eight years. I cannot believe that they killed Rit, said Anil Chandra Bera, a neighbour of the family.

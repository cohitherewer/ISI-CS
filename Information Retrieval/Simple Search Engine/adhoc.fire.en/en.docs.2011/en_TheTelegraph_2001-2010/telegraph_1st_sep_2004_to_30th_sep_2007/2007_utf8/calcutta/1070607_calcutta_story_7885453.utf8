 Woman punches police officer

 - Drunk gang of four in the net after altercation with cops, residents

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 A senior police officer was slapped, kicked and abused by a woman in the presence of two of his colleagues on Tuesday night. 

 The assault on the officer-in-charge of Baguiati traffic guard continued for over 15 minutes but the cops all of them were on duty did nothing to stop the tormentor. 

 We were clueless on how to rein in the aggressive woman. The rulebook does not allow us to use force on a woman, said Tapan Biswas, assistant sub-inspector of the traffic guard. 

 So, Biswas and constable Arun Sarkar had to wait till the arrival of a team of officers, including women constables, from Rajarhat police station to rescue their boss, Maniklal Ganguly. 

 In my 35 years of service, I never faced a situation like this. It was really shocking, said Ganguly. 

 He later filed a complaint in Baguiati police station against Sanghamitra Majumder, her husband Rupam and two others Saikat Sarkar and Sanjit Roy for assaulting him and creating nuisance.

 Investigation has revealed that officers of Park Street police station had also booked Sanghamitra and Rupam on New Years eve for creating nuisance.

 According to the police, trouble started on Tuesday around 10.15pm near the Baguiati bus stop when a group of local youths confronted the gang of four, who were drunk and passing lewd remarks and making obscene gestures. 

 When the local youths asked them to leave the spot, Sanghamitra started abusing them and soon, her husband and the two others also got involved.

 They were really rude Instead of calming down and leaving the place peacefully, they misbehaved with us, recounted Joydeb Das, a resident of Baguiati. 

 The heated exchanges between the two groups alerted officials of the Baguiati traffic guard, barely a few yards away from the bus stop on VIP Road. 

 We reached the spot and asked all of them to leave without creating any further trouble, said the two traffic guard officers. 

 But Rupam was in no mood to relent and he started abusing the cop for interfering in a personal matter. 

 The commotion outside the traffic guard forced Ganguly to reach the spot. As the four youths were shouting at the top of their voices, Ganguly tried to take Rupam to a corner to placate him. 

 But before he could step forward, Sanghamitra pounced on him and started kicking and slapping him. In a fit of rage, she even tore off the identity badge from his uniform. 

 Instead of restraining her, Rupam and the two others watched her assaulting me I tried to tell her what she was doing was wrong, but she was in no mood to listen, said Ganguly, who was rescued by a Baguiati police team. 

 The gang of four was arrested and produced in court on Wednesday. While Rupam, Saikat and Sanjit have been sent to two weeks judicial custody, Sanghamitra has got bail, on the condition of a weekly appearance in the police station. 

 The incident is disturbing as the youths assaulted a policeman on duty. We will fight the case to ensure exemplary punishment for them, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

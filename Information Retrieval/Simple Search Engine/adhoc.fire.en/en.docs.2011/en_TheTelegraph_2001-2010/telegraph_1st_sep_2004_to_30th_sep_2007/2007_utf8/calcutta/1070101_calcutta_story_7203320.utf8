The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Building blocks, by the book

 Calcutta 2007 

Real estate

 The brick-and-mortar boom just keeps growing louder. The mammoth South City complex on Prince Anwar Shah Road leads the residential roar with 800 apartments in its first and second towers poised for a second quarter debut.

 Silver Spring, the condo complex next to ITC Sonar Bangla, will hand over 500 apartments in February-March. Sherwood Estate in Narendrapur, a 1,600-apartment residential project by the consortium of PS Group, Heritage Group and Srijan Group, is expected to throw open around 900 flats by May-June.

 The first phase of Uniworld City by Bengal Unitech Universal should be ready by the year-end, with 404 units including penthouses. Ujjwala The Condoville by Bengal Ambuja, coming up in Action Area II of New Town, will be ready by the last quarter. Hiland Woods by the United Credit Belani Group, also in Action Area II of Rajarhat, will be handed over during the year. Greenwood Park Extension by Bengal Shrachi, Sunrise Point by the Sureka Group and Akansha by Bengal Shelter, all joint-sector housing estates in Rajarhat, are also eyeing a 2007 unveiling, besides Clubtown Enclave on VIP Road and Clubtown Estate on Jessore Road.

 Among the existing players, Haldia Petrochemicals will add 30 per cent to its capacity while kicking off construction for its second unit. On the road to industrial revival, tyres will roll out of Dunlops Sahagunj factory. The government will also start land acquisition for Salim Groups multipurpose and chemical SEZs near Haldia. 

 Information Technology

 The year ahead will see a flood of office space for tech companies, in and around Calcutta.

Almost all existing players have expansion plans in 2007.

Safety and security measures for techies including pre-paid taxi booth, round-the-clock police patrol and state-of-the-art computerised police station for Sector V are slated for 2007.

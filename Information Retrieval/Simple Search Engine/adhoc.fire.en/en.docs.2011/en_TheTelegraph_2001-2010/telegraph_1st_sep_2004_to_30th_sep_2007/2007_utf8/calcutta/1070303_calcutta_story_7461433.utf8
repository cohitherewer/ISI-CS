 Colours of divinity

 Lord Krishna, worshipped as an avatar of Lord Vishnu, derives his intensely human form from his descriptions in epics. His exploits, collectively called Krishna Leela, are a popular theme for Indian artists over centuries. He is often depicted as a mischievous child stealing butter, a cowherd protecting cows, a naughty adolescent, a passionate lover and also a slayer of demons. Faag, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by four young artists, pays the most colourful obeisance to Lord Krishna. Portraying him as the creator; powerful, unifying, multi-dimensional, it is also a celebration of the colours and moods of spring. The focal element of Abhijit Mollicks works is human faces. Biswajit Mitra (Return of the Native; picture right) specialises in depicting incidents from the daily life of ordinary human beings. Sujit Das brings to life scenes from the countryside in his works. Bijoy Basaks paintings are gentle, subtle expressions of his adoration for the divine.

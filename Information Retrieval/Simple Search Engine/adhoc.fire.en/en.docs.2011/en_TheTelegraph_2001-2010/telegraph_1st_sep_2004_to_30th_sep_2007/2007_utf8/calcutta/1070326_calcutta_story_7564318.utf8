 Nature recollected in tranquillity

 SOUMITRA DAS

 A painting by Ganesh Haloi at the exhibition

 Imagine the moments before touching down at Calcutta airport. Suddenly the stretches of uniform green paddy fields begin to resemble a huge patchwork quilt with intricate geometric designs, each trapezoid, rectangle and triangle snugly fitting into one another. This is how viewers may feel on seeing Ganesh Halois paintings on exhibition at Akar Prakar.

 Mere nostalgia for a lost rural paradise could not have been the only stimulus at work when Haloi conceived these paintings which come close to the Wordsworthian view of poetry being emotions recollected in tranquillity. Only in Halois case one can replace emotions with nature.

 A sense of peace and tranquillity pervades Halois work. He goes close enough to nature to discover the grand design that underlies it, but not close enough to record the more unflattering truths.

 Rarely are there references to living beings. Here, however, there is a small bird in flight and there is a grove of trees in another.

 One work is like a green symphony with its play of various tones of quite literally chlorophyll. For, after all, it is vegetation that Haloi is depicting. From sap green, to viridian to the feathers of a parrot and Nile green the canvas is a subtle interplay of all these shades.

 In another canvas, the green background is marked by a series of vertical lines in lemon yellow, the lines occasionally crinkled like the knots on bamboo. They could also be penants springing out of some of the paintings. Moss is the colour of Halois choice in another work, the space divided into three horizontal sections, each section with its own gradation of this shade of green.

 Haloi builds up his works almost the same way an architect designs a building. He brings together blocks of colours closely akin to each other, with perhaps one or more blocks in various contrasting shades. 

 Pale creams or buffs juxtaposed with splinters of ultramarine, Indian red, viridian and indigo create a sense of harmony and rhythm that still exist in the landscape of rural Bengal, attempts at industrialisation notwithstanding.

 It is because of their strong structure that Halois paintings often resemble depictions of the built environment of medieval towns in Rajasthan with their conglomeration of roofs and staircases leading in and out of light. Pools of darkness are connected with sun-bleached vistas. 

 Ultimately, these are mental landscapes depictions of the artists thinking process which allows him to visualise his works and bring them to life with infinite patience. Observing life from a distance, he maintains peace of mind and sanity.

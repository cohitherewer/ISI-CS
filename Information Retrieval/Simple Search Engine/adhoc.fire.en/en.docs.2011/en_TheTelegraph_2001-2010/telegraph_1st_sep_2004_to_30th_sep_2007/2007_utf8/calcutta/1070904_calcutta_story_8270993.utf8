 Mohammed Abdul Rabbani could not have thought of getting admitted to the paramedical course. His father is a daily wage labourer and cannot afford to finance his sons studies. But thanks to Techno Medizines that helped many like Abdul to pursue the course. 

 Thirty marginalised students were recently conferred scholarships to study a two-year paramedical course at its Salt Lake Sector V campus by Techno Medizines a Techno India Group and Suraksha Group joint venture. A newly formed minority body Naya Zamana identified poor, meritorious students from Calcutta and the districts for the scholarships. The selection was based on the 10+2 results of students with physics, chemistry and biology. Twenty-one of the students were from the districts and the rest from the city. 

 Fifteen students have enrolled for diploma in medical laboratory technology (DLT) while the other 15 would undergo training for a diploma in radiography diagnostic (DRD). The course fee is Rs 30,000 for both diplomas. This amount has been waived in the case of these 30 meritorious students, informed Satyam Roy Chowdhury, director, Techno India Group. The students would be taught how to operate x-ray, ultra sound, citi scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines and trained for blood examination, blood bio-chemistry and so on. After completion of the two-year course, they would be ready to undertake jobs as technicians in medical labs.

 I am unemployed at the moment but I had got 60 per cent in the 10+2 board exams. Those marks came in handy for selection here. This is a big break for me, 24-year-old Abdul told Metro.

 Nineteen-year-old Ruma Naaz is currently a second year botany honours student at Bangabasi College. I will discontinue my honours course in favour of this diploma because it would give me a job at the end of two years, said the Anjuman Girls High School pass-out. Her father, the lone bread-earner in the family of five, has a meagre monthly salary of Rs 3,000. I am banking on this course so that I can share my fathers burden, Naaz said.

 Congress chief whip Manas Bhunia, who was present on the occasion, said: Seventy per cent of the technical staff currently working in various nursing homes, clinics and hospitals are not qualified enough. As diagnosis has become investigation oriented, it is of utmost importance that people in the labs are competent and deliver error-free reports. He said the first batch of Techno Medizines would surely get jobs because there is a demand in the market for people trained in paramedics.

 Among other dignitaries present at the function, were minister of land and land reforms Abdur Rezzak Mollah and urban development and municipal affairs minister Ashok Bhattacharya. Techo Medizines representatives said the institution would look to provide scholarships to some other backward section of the society next year.

 Masti at Sabera

 They sat in silence as popular shows on Disney Channel rolled one after another on the screen up front, followed by a trailer of Ratatouille. But the moment the lights were turned on, the room came alive with the buzzing of the young participants. But that too did not last long, for the Masti ki Pathshala teacher, microphone in hand, had challenged them to some quick classwork.

 Children of Sabera Foundation were soon belting out songs and helping themselves to Disney merchandise as prizes. Little Simran (picture by Sudeshna Banerjee), the youngest to face the mike at five, sang a Dhoom track, with an impish smile on her lips and without a trace of tune in her voice. But once the prize was handed over to her, the cat got her tongue. 

 But Madhumita Das was ready to take over. We watch many of these serials on CDs in the weekends. So we know of Hannah Montana and Art Attack, she said in fluent English. And why not? The first student of Sabera calls annual visitor Ricky Martin uncle and has shared the stage in Los Angeles with Penelope Cruz and Melanie Griffith. 

 Such interactive sessions enhance the leadership skills of our girls, Saikat Nasker, project manager, explained the benefits of visits like the one from Disney Channel. The channel, through the school contact programme Masti Ki Pathshala, is reaching out to 900 schools in India, including 65 in Calcutta.

 Woman goons held

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Six members of an all-woman gang were arrested on Saturday evening after they stole valuables from invitees during Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations at Salt Lake stadium. 

 The organisers caught one of the women red-handed. Her statement helped police to round up her accomplices.

 Two gold chains were found on the arrested women. We suspect the rest of the ornaments had been passed on to other members of the gang, said an officer of Bidhannagar (south) police station.

 According to the police, nearly 20,000 people had turned up at the event, organised by Sanskritik Parishad. The first theft was noticed around 12.30pm, during lunch. Gopa Basak, one of the invitees, found her gold chain, weighing about 30 g, missing and raised an alarm, said Jagannath Gupta, the Parishads secretary.

 Within an hour, 12 other women found their jewellery missing. The organisers started to keep a close eye on the exits. We spotted a woman, in her early-50s, moving suspiciously. On being confronted, she started running. She threw away a gold chain that she had stolen in a bid to escape, but we caught her, said Gupta.

 The woman, identified as Sonali Mallik, pretended to be an invitee. During interrogation, she confessed to her crime and disclosed the names of her accomplices, said an officer of Bidhannagar (south) police station. 

 The other five arrested were identified as Asha Daw, 30, Sunita Datun, 31, Nalini Goyel, 21, Minu Gupta, 28, and Jayati Shau, 32. All of them are from in and around the city and have criminal records, added the officer.

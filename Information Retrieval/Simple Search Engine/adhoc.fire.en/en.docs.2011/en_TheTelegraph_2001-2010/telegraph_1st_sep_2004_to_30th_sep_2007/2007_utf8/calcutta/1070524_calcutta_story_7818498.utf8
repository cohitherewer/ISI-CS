 - More halls to adopt digital technology

 Digital cinema is all set to be the new mantra in the entertainment business. In order to curb growing piracy and escalating print cost, digital prints beamed via satellites are being increasingly looked upon as an alternative to the existing system.

 This was claimed by UFO Moviez, the worlds largest digital cinema network in the city on Wednesday.

 The company plans to increase its presence from across 650 screens in the country to 1,000 screens by Diwali, said Rajaa Kanwar, vice-chairman, UFO Moviez, an offshoot of the Apollo Tyres group.

 In Bengal, it aims to cover about 150 screens in the state in the next three months. UFO technology now spans across 55 screens in the state, with Roxy and Paradise being the only Calcutta halls on the list.

 We have discovered that Bengal is a good market for us and are looking at expanding our reach not only in Calcutta, but also in suburban cinemas where Bengali films are screened, said Kanwar. 

 INOX Darjeeling has been screening movies using the UFO technology ever since it began operations in April 2006. The latest blockbuster Life in a Metro, as well as last years big hit Dhoom:2, were screened using the digital cinema system.

 UFO Moviez has been in the digital cinema business for the past one-and-a-half years and we have done exceedingly well, considering the fact that we have just ventured into the business, said Kanwar.

 The company has reached out to international markets such as Dubai, Mauritius and Sri Lanka.

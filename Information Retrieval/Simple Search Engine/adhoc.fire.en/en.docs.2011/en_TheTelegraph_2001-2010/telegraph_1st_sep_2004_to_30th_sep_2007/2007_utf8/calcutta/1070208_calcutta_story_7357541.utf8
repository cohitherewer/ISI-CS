 Organising the Book Fair at Salt Lake stadium is inviting traffic snarls on the EM Bypass.

 The realisation has dawned on the organisers of the mega event, Publishers and Booksellers Guild, prompting them to write to police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, seeking steps for effective management of traffic on roads leading to the fair venue.

 Guild insiders say the organisation had never bothered with traffic matters when the fair was held on the Maidan, where a large number of visitors would avail of the Metro. On the Bypass, there is no alternative to road traffic.

 The letter was sent on Sunday, a few hours after the Guild discussed the traffic scenario with officials of the transport and sports department and North 24-Parganas police.

 Among other steps, it sought additional police deployment at six Bypass crossings, including the ones with Ultadanga Main Road, Maniktala Main Road and Narkeldanga Main Road.

 With the average daily footfall projected at 50,000, traffic management is a key area of concern. More so, since the venue is on the EM Bypass, said Guild general secretary Tridib Chatterjee.

 As for police, another cause for worry is the likely impact of the Prime Ministers scheduled visit to the city on February 12 and 13. 

 The Prime Ministers convoy will obviously pass through the Bypass, said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim.

 Officers of the Sealdah Traffic Guard fear the worst congestion will be at the crossing of the Bypass with Narkeldanga Main Road. The narrow road struggles to cope with traffic on a normal day; during the fair, the load is likely to double.

 As part of the traffic management scheme, police have decided that in extreme situations, airport-bound vehicles will be diverted to the Rajarhat flyover from the Bypass. 

 A part of the wall of Subhas Sarobar has been dismantled to make room for service roads, which Book Fair-bound cars can take to reach the parking lot, said a senior officer.

 We have also asked the Guild to set up barricades along the Bypass, but it has not yet done so. The Guild should also illuminate the parking lot, he pointed out.

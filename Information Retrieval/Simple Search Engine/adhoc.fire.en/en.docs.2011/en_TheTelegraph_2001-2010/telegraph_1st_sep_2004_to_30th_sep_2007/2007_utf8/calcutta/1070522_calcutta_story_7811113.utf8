 The chief minister, who has often waxed eloquent on the competence of Calcutta Police, spoke on corruption in the force at a police function on Monday.

 There is corruption in every sphere of life. As a politician, I can say even some politicians are corrupt. But when you do something corrupt, sometimes in uniform, it really affects the public, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who is also the police minister, told a gathering at the Lalbazar police headquarters. Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee shared the dais with him.

 The chief minister admitted that a lecture would not root out corruption in the force. Its not just about me asking you from this platform not to be corrupt. You need to think about the matter and avoid the wrong path. I know that only some of you are corrupt but that is enough to tarnish the image of the force, he said.

 Bhattacharjee also dealt with other aspects of policing. Comparing crime trends in the city with those in other metros, the chief minister expressed concern over the spurt in crime against women.

 Crime against women seems to be increasing steadily. There are several socio-economic factors behind this. I would like to see such cases, including complaints of eve-teasing, handled firmly. The responsibility does not lie only with the detective department. The police stations must be told to handle crime strictly, said Bhattacharjee.

 He called upon the force to punish criminals without considering their political affiliations.

 Bhattacharjee also asked the policemen to attend to those who visit police stations with care and politeness. He said: One has to change the common perception that the police only try to beat up people. You must ensure that each person who seeks help, no matter what his social standing is, gets good behaviour and a patient hearing. At night, when everyone is asleep, youre the face of the government.

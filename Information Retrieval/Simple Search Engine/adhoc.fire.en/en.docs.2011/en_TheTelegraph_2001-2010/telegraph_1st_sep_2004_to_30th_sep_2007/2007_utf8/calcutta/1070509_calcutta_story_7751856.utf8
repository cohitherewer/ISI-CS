The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rain dip in days mercury

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Temperatures dropped as heavy rain lashed the city and its adjoining areas on Tuesday morning.

 The Met office in Alipore recorded 40.7 mm of rain, the highest pre-monsoon rainfall recorded in the city this year, which pulled down Tuesdays maximum temperature by about four degrees.

 Turbulent clouds gathered in the southern parts of the city and gradually spread over the city, starting off a downpour at 8. 30am which continued in phases till 11.30am.

 Director of the weather section, Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore, G.C. Debnath, said: We expect more rain in the south Bengal districts, including Calcutta, during the next 24 hours. However, the rainfall will be scattered. We also expect rain in the areas closer to the coast.

 Heavy incursion of moisture from the Bay of Bengal has led to the formation of huge masses of cumulonimbus clouds that caused the downpour, added Debnath.

 A cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) had formed over Jharkhand and its adjoining areas. This cyclonic circulation had sucked in loads of moisture from the sea. And fuelled by the humid heat, it caused Tuesdays rains, explained the weatherman.

 However, there is little chance of prolonged heavy rain in the city. 

 Tuesdays rain was part of the Norwester activities, common around this time of the year, and the weather in the next few days will be pleasant, added the Met office director.

 CMC off to apex court

 - SHOP AD TAX RULING

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has decided to move the Supreme Court against a recent high court judgment that held that the civic body had no authority to collect tax from companies which advertise on shop signboards.

 Calcutta Soft Drinks, an association of firms that market soft drinks, had moved the high court against the decision by the civic body to collect the tax.

 A single judge bench of the high court had earlier allowed the CMC to tax companies that advertise on signboards of paan and other shops.

 When the judges ruling was challenged before a division bench, the two judges on it expressed different views. One of them ruled that the CMC had the right to collect the tax, while the other judge said it didnt. 

 When the matter was sent to a third judge for disposal, Justice B. Bhattacharya stated that the CMC had no authority to collect the tax.

 Two of the four judges of the high court had ruled in favour of the CMC. We want to place the matter before the apex court for a final ruling, said the civic lawyer, Alok Ghosh. 

 In 2004, the civic authorities had first demanded tax from companies that used to display advertisements on the signboards of retail stores. The CMC argument was that by using the signboards, the companies were evading taxes. 

 The decision of the high court is preventing the civic body from earning crores of rupees as tax. Two major soft drinks companies, which benefit the most from the system, had challenged the single bench order, said a CMC spokesperson.

 The lawyer appearing for the association argued that the companies display advertisements on the signboards of their retail outlets. The CMC has no right to claim extra tax for this display, he asserted.

 The CMC lawyer claimed that civic body had the right to demand tax on any advertisement displayed on the road.

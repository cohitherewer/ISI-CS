 Rescued from Mumbai

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An 18-year-old girl has been rescued from the flesh trade she was pushed into by her husband.

 Alo (name changed), a resident of Barasat, was rescued from an apartment in Chembur, Mumbai, on Thursday night following several raids across the city over the past year. Husband Rahul Majumder, 26, however, managed to give the raiding cops the slip.

 We were pursuing the case since 2005 and could finally rescue the girl on January 18, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 Rahul married Alo after abandoning his first wife. He had suppressed the fact from her that he was already married, said S.M.H. Meerza, sub-divisional police officer, Barasat.

 Alo met Rahul, a resident of Ashokenagar, on the northern fringes of the city, two years ago. He would join my daughter whenever she would go to market, recalled Alos mother, who works as attendant at a nursing home. She avoided him initially, but Rahul managed to win her confidence. They got married in February 2005 and left for Mumbai, where Rahul said he had got a job.

 The mother became suspicious, as Alo did not communicate with her after leaving for Mumbai. Even Rahuls family in Ashokenagar behaved rudely with her. I lodged a complaint against Rahul in April 2005, Alos mother added.

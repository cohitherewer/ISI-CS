 Buses scare, kill amp; flee

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Caught between a racing private bus and a minibus, a 26-year-old motorcyclist lost control and was crushed by a state bus on VIP Road, just before noon on Monday.

 The bus sped away, adding to the number of killer drivers going scot-free.

 Gobinda Bapari, who lived in Jagatpur of Rajarhat and ran a garment shop there, was going to Burrabazar.

 Near the Dum Dum Park bus stand, he found his motorcycle hemmed in by a private bus (route 44) and a minibus that were trying to overtake each other at high speed.

 Baparis two-wheeler skidded on the rain-drenched road and he fell down. The state bus behind him drove over him, killing him on the spot.

 Forest department official Pabitra Roy, who witnessed the mishap, said: One of the wheels of the bus rolled over the mans head. The vehicle sped away before anyone could react. All three speeding buses were responsible for the mans death.

 According to Baparis elder brother Naren, he had left home around 11am for work. My father is nearly 70 and is ailing. I dont know how to break the news to him, said Naren.

 An officer of Lake Town police station said the youth panicked after being caught between the racing buses. He was not wearing a helmet, the officer added.

 Suitcases with the names and logos of VIP and other brands were seized from the Howrah godown of Vishal Mega Mart on Friday. 

 On Thursday evening, fake VIP suitcases were seized from Vishal Mega Marts outlet on VIP Road, near Baguiati. Three employees of the store were arrested during the raid.

 A complaint by VIP Industries and Blow Plast, manufacturers and distributors of VIP suitcases and bags, prompted the raid by police.

 We are trying to find out whether the suitcases seized on Friday are also fake, superintendent of North 24-Parganas police Praveen Kumar told Metro on Friday. We will raid other outlets of Vishal Mega Mart, he added. 

 The district police are coordinating with their counterparts in the city and its adjoining areas to carry out raids on the other Vishal Mega Mart outlets. 

 We have informed Calcutta Police about the recovery of fake suitcases from the Baguiati outlet, said an officer who was part of the team that conducted the raids.

 Floor manager of the Baguiati outlet Abhijit Dey, computer operator Umesh Sharma and store manager Chandrajit Dey, who were held on Thursday, were produced in Barrackpore court on Friday and remanded in police custody till May 3. 

 We have been interrogating the three. It seems that they had been selling the fake suitcases for the past few months. The modus operandi was simple the officials attached stickers of reputed brands on low-quality suitcases, said the officer. 

 The officers probing the case suspect that the names and logos of other brands were also being misused. We are conducting raids to nab other people involved in the racket, said another officer.

 Sutapa Bag, the only witness to the death of her nine-year-old daughter Tiyasa and husband Jayanta, has blamed her husband for the tragedy. But officers of the criminal investigation department (CID), which is probing the incident, have found several discrepancies in her statements.

 Sutapa is suppressing a number of facts that will help us crack the case. Her sister Madhumita is also not telling the truth, said an officer, who questioned the 31-year-old widow over the past two days, since she was released from Howrah State General Hospital.

 On April 3, police and neighbours found the child lying dead on the floor of the Bag familys Jagachha house and Jayanta, a quack, writhing in pain with his throat slit. Sutapa was lying in another room, with injuries on her hands and throat.

 Police had initially said Jayanta had committed suicide after trying to kill his wife and child. He had been assaulted by local youths hours ago. 

 It appears that Sutapa and Madhumita had discussed the version of events they are going to state. Madhumita used to spend considerable time with her sister at the hospital, added the officer.

 In another development, Sumantra Bag has stated that his brother Jayanta was involved in a pornography racket. 

 We are looking into the development seriously. Our prime job is to crack the childs murder, said Bhupinder Singh, additional director-general of CID.

 The last time she was in Calcutta, she broke many a heart by bowing out to Swedish tennis star Martina Hingis 1-6, 0-6 in the Sunfeast Open semi finals. 

 But when she touched down at Dum Dum airport after eight months for a whirlwind promotional tour in the city, Sania Mirza took little time to renew her love affair with the fans in Calcutta. 

 As the heart throb from Hyderabad, escorted by mother Nasima Mirza, reached Park Street for a promotional appearance, peak-hour traffic on Wednesday morning came to a halt. 

 I have been standing here since 10.30. Somebody told me that she would be here for a programme, said Ramzan Ali, a trader from Mullickbazar, who was waiting in front of AG Towers, on Park Street, just to catch a glimpse of his favourite sportsperson. 

 His prayers were answered after a two-hour-long wait when a caravan of cars reached the spot. But by then, the cars had pulled up at the kerbs and students had stopped by on their way home. 

 In a white-and-green T-shirt and tucked up jeans, Sania stepped out of the SUV as the crowd went berserk and Sania. Sania chants filled the air. 

 The screams and eyeballs followed her through the day as she went mall-hopping, from Elgin Road in the afternoon to Salt Lake in the evening. 

 At City Centre, the personal security staff of the young tennis player had a tough time controlling the crowd. During her 10-minute stay, over 2,500 people gathered to catch a glimpse of Sania. 

 Waow! I did not expect to see so many people here waiting just for me, Sania blushed as boys and girls jostled to take a closer look. 

 At present, Sania ranks 48 in singles and 38 in doubles and for some time, she has been struggling to be among the top 50 in the world. 

 But for most of her fans, her status as an icon is not only because of her performance on the court. 

 Her ranking may have dipped recently and she is not winning tournaments But I just like her, she looks like a model and she has such a great style sense, said 19-year-old Payal Malani, a first-year student of Bhawanipur College. 

 And thats what the brands she endorses want from her to cash in on the craze among the young and the restless. 

 Today, she is clearly the number one youth icon in the country. The young girls emulate her fashion statements and the boys go crazy at the sight of her, said a spokesperson of a cola firm, explaining the companys association with her.

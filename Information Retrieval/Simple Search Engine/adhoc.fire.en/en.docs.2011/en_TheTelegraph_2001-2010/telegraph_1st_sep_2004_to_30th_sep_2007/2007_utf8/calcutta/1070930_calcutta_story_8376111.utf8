 Going by the ear

 In another time, a mehfil of Indian classical music, besides entertaining the audience, also occasioned a dialogue between performers and listeners, some sort of an exchange between equals. Artists had peculiar ways of engaging their audiences. The legendary Kesarbai Kerkar was known to sing a few notes irrelevant to a particular raga and loved to see her audience go mad. Sometimes she even interrupted herself with self-congratulatory remarks aimed at friends sitting before her. Kaisa re lagaya, kyun Shantibai? she would smile triumphantly, as her friend voiced her admiration. 

 The falling standard of listening critically is as much of a reality as the much-bemoaned decline of the classical arts. These days, it is not unusual to be distracted by the loud snore of the next person while you are enjoying a morning raga at the end of a nightlong concert. Vocalist Sunanda Pattanaik, it is said, had once violently startled and dislodged one such snorer off his chair with one of her gut-wrenching taans . However, there are many who are still profoundly stirred by the melodies, but are unable to figure out why a particular rendition of Bihag sounds more enchanting than another, or what makes a critic wax eloquent on the beauties of the komal rishabh in raga Shree. 

 The ITC Sangeet Research Academy, the premier institution for the advancement of scholarship and performance of Hindustani classical music, has designed a unique certificate course in music appreciation that would create self-aware listeners and connoisseurs of raagsangeet. Starting from October 5, through bi-weekly sessions for 30 weeks, this course will take the uninitiated listener through the fundamentals raga, tala, sur, laya and so on. Combining live demonstrations with examples from the archive of the academy, the participants would not only learn these basic concepts but would also be able to judge a musical performance on their own. 

 Indeed, the idea is to have a community of kansens or connoisseurs who would put a check on artists by engaging actively with performances. The participants would be screened on the basis of their interest in the subject and they have to pass at least Higher Secondary or its equivalent. Such a course might be able to revive popular interest in classical music to a great extent.

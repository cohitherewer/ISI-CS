 Catch them young and watch them model

 - The growing popularity of cute little things prompts a grooming course for tots and tweens

 LOOK, NO STAGE FRIGHT: A grooming session for young models at Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society

 Akash Paul is a popular face on ramp and billboard. He works two days a week and makes up to Rs 9,000 a month. He is five years old.

 Rishita Saha endorses biscuits, footwear, detergent and even real estate. She pockets Rs 2,500 for a days work. She is four years old.

 Move over pretty young things (PYTs), the cute little things (CLTs) are here. Rishita and Akash are two among a growing tribe of children being used to catch the eye of the consumer, from fashion shows to television commercials.

 To catch them young and plug a need gap, Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society has started a six-week course in modelling for children between age three and 14. We help these youngsters get rid of their stage fright. Once they lose that inhibition, we work on their body language and speech. They are also taught how to face the camera, says Heena Gorsia, honorary general secretary of the Society. At present, 20 kids are being put through the paces, 150 minutes, thrice a week.

 Nothing works like the innocence of a child. The idea is to make every mother want her son or daughter to be like the child in the advertisement. They symbolise purity and the product can reach more people by spending less when endorsed by a child, says ad-guru Prahlad Kakkar. But he is opposed to the idea of grooming kids. The moment you start tutoring a kid, the innocence is lost and the child starts behaving like an adult.

 Try telling that to parents eager to make models out of their tots and tweens. From bringing their child to modelling school on Elgin Road to passing on some tips about facing the camera, they are very much part of the grooming game.

 I feel very happy to see her on television and her pictures on billboards. Who knows, she might take up modelling or acting as a full-time career. This stint will sharpen her skills, says Arzoo Saha, who manages daughter Rishitas portfolio and pay cheques. I am a little fussy about the brands she poses for. If the brand is good then the financial aspect is negotiable but if it is an ordinary brand the remuneration must match industry rates, she stresses.

 The trend has really caught on in the past two years. Many ads are written with a child as the central character. I get calls asking for about 12 kids a month, says model co-ordinator Jikesh Shah.

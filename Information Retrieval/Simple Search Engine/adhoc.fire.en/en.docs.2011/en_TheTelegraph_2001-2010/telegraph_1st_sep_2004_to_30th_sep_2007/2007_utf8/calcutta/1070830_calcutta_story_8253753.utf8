 Emission test centre sealed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An auto-emission testing centre in Chetla was sealed on Wednesday after its test results on a vehicle were found to be in variance with that by a mobile auto-emission testing unit, flagged off hours earlier.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty sent off the Tata Sumo fitted with smoke metres and gas analysers in front of Writers Buildings in the morning.

 Within five minutes, officials manning the Sumo stopped a taxi that was belching dark smoke. 

 The cars emission was found to hover close to the maximum possible (99.9 per cent of the highest value).

 The taxi driver, however, produced a pollution under control (PUC) certificate issued on August 25 by an auto emission testing centre at 29/3 Chetla Road. The public vehicles department officials took the taxi to the centre, where it was tested again. This time the score was 75 per cent. 

 We ordered the centre to be sealed. It was clear that it had been issuing PUCs to polluting vehicles for a fee. The taxi driver has also been penalised, said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.

 We need to have more mobile testing units, which will conduct random checks and help us identify auto emission testing centres that are issuing PUCs in exchange of money, added Chowdhury.

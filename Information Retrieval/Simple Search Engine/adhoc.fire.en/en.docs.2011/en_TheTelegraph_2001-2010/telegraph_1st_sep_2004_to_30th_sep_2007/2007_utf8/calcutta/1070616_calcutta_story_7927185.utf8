 A juicy affair

 Summer, along with its customary heat spells and endless power-cuts, brings in its wake a delightful delicacy to pamper the taste-buds mango, the king of fruits. To generate awareness on mango and mango products in West Bengal, the Indian Chamber of Commerce and The Agri-Horticulture Society of India, with the support of the department of food processing amp; horticulture, government of West Bengal, are jointly organising the ongoing Mango Mahotsava, 2007. The event also aims to explore export possibilities of both fresh and processed products of mango, ensuring better price to growers and implementation of international quality standards for the global market. Besides a competition and exhibition of 66 varieties of mango and 31 types of mango products, there will be a grower-buyer-seller meet, a day-long seminar and workshop (today) on Quality Improvement of Mango for Domestic and Export Requirement, and a cooking demonstration of mango dishes by an expert, along with the sale of mango and its products at the show arena.

 lEvent: Mango Mahotsava 2007 lWhen: Till June 17; 8 am - 8 pm lWhere: The Agri-Horticultural Society of India, 1 Alipore Road

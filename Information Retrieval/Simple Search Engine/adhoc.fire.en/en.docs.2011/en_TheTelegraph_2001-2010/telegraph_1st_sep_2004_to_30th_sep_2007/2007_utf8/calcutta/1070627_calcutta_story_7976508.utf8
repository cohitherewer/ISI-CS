 Woven works of art

 Tapestry has a long and glorious past. India has a rich heritage of hand-woven textiles which has survived modern technology and is much sought-after the world over. Contemporary Indian tapestry works are characterised by their richness of colour, energised by lines with a rhythm and life of their own. The paintings of Paris-based master Syed Haider Raza, known for their warm and vibrant colours, predominance of strong geometric forms and rootedness in Indian culture, look particularly beautiful when translated into the language of tanabana or warp and weft. The flaming colours of Razas works dazzle and blaze in the medium of tapestry at the ongoing inaugural exhibition of tapestries and serigraphs of his paintings. The bindu, symbol of creative energy, or divine and artistic creation, is the starting point of most of the works. Full of small motifs, concentric circles, triangles, rectangles and ellipses in countless permutations and combinations, each work of art, with its intriguing title woven into the tapestry, is signed by the master himself and is accompanied by a certificate of authenticity.

 Event: Tapestries and serigraphs of Syed Haider Razas works When: Till July 7 (except Sunday); 3.30 pm - 7 pm Where: Gallery K2, Supra Court, 35 Lansdowne Terrace

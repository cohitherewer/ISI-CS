 Sir Bobby Charlton and Ruud Gullit at the pro league kick-off in September, the talismanic Steven Gerrard leading the Liverpool Reds in a probable pre-season trip, more live TV, artificial pitches, better stadiums and a move towards a professional administration by 2010.

 Football, the perennial passion of Calcutta, long languishing in a shoddy set-up with myopic Maidan mandarins, could get a new kick of life feeding on Fifas action plan, Win in India with India, triggered by its president Sepp Blatters visit in April, if all the passes stitch together.

 Fifa has in principle agreed to support infrastructure upgrade if ownership of grounds can be obtained on long-term lease and if the state government can offer matching grants. The Calcutta clubs could be huge beneficiaries of this scheme in the long run, feels Subrata Dutta, vice-president of All India Football Federation (AIFF).

 Dutta, who recently stepped down as secretary of Indian Football Association (IFA), which runs the game in Bengal, was in Zurich last month to attend the Fifa congress as part of the federation delegation. 

 The former Man U and England great and the ex-Dutch captain are both expected to be in town, the likely venue for the inauguration of the professional National Football League on September 30, Dutta tells Metro.

 Blatter spoke of the tremendous enthusiasm for the game in Calcutta and promised to catalyse a stream of visits by past and present international stars as well as top clubs to the city, he says. 

 Representatives of Liverpool Football Club met AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi in Zurich to discuss the possibility of a visit and Calcutta is sure to be a stop if the trip works out, Dutta stresses.

 AIFF has already kicked off a comprehensive discussion with the defence ministry on upgrade of infrastructure of the three leading football clubs in Calcutta Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting which are located on army land. This is part of the federations football development roadmap (2007-2010) to be dovetailed into the Fifa project.

 As part of the plan, the state associations have been directed to move towards a professional structure and upgrade facilities to meet Fifa/AFC (Asian Football Confederation) requirements. 

 We realise theres a huge need for a more professional management platform and better infrastructure. We will be meeting the sports minister and the defence authorities to discuss building on the Maidan and also about our own ground. The challenge is to bring the families to the matches and broad-base the games appeal, observes new IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly.

 The association has entered into a four-year agreement with STAR Ananda for telecast rights of the Super Division League ties, for Rs 12.41 crore, Ganguly confirms. 

 The IFA Shield, which still has ESPN on board, should see a better quality field this year, with the possibility of a couple of teams from Europe.

 The AIFF blueprint proposes setting up a regional football house in Calcutta with a minimum support of Rs 1 lakh per month. 

 The city is also likely to benefit from the plan to roll out two artificial pitches every year for four years and re-laying of turf pitches, for which $ 500,000 is to be allocated.

 The Maidan welcomes the development initiative, while pleading better information flow and a more sympathetic attitude towards the clubs. 

 Of course, we all want better infrastructure, which will raise standards. But its equally important that our voice is heard and the federation along with the IFA, must spell out our roles with absolute clarity so that we are in sync with the revival roadmap, says Amit Sen, director, Kingfisher East Bengal.

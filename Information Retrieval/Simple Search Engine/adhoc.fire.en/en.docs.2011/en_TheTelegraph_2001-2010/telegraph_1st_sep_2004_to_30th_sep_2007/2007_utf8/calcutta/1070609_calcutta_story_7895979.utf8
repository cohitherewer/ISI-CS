 Solid silt clogs city hub sewer

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Over Rs 100 crore have been spent by the civic body over the past 20 years to clear underground sewers.

 Result: A stretch of a 3.5-ft-diameter sewer beneath the heart of the city is almost full of silt, which has so hardened over the decades that only trained diggers can chisel it out.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has decided to hire 30 labourers trained in digging wells to chisel out the solid silt from a 300-m stretch of the sewer between Vardaan Market and Park Street, said mayoral council member (drainage and sewerage) Farzana Chowdhury.

 Civic workers had failed to scoop out the silt with spades. Attempts with a jetting-cum-suction machine and a blow-vac machine, too, had failed.

 One-third of the sewer is clogged, said Chowdhury. Nothing has been done to desilt it for the past several years.

 Desilting was done only on paper. What else could explain why the water-holding capacity of the citys sewer network has not increased? asked mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

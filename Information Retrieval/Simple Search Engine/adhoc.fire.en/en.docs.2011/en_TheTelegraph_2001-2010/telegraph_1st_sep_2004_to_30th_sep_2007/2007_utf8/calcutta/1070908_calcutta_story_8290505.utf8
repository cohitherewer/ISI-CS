 The City Diary

 The traders of Park Circus market, who had claimed that the market stood on Wakf land, have been summonsed by the state Wakf board for a hearing. On June 26, the leader of the civic Opposition, Javed Ahmed Khan, had submitted a document in the civic House claiming that the land on which the market stands is a Wakf property since February 1908 and hence, the Left Front boards decision to hand over the market to Reliance Retail for redevelopment is illegal. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has dismissed the claim. 

 A 50-year-old Reserve Force constable, Pabitra Mohan Ghosh, who was on leave, turned up at his office at Entallys Padmapukur around 11.45am on Friday, took out a bottle of poison from his pocket and consumed it before anyone could react. He was taken to Calcutta Police Hospital. He was shifted first to SSKM Hospital and then to Sambhu Nath Pandit Hospital. His condition is critical. 

 Biswanath Das, a contractor, was shot at by a gang at Lakshmi Ghat, near Sodepur, on the citys northern fringes, on Friday. Das had recently bagged a contract for operating ferry services. Witnesses said the gang members hurled bombs at Das and then shot at him from close quarters. Das has been admitted at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.

 Barasat Motor Vehicles department carried random checks on vehicles plying on VIP Road on Friday and lodged cases against the owners of 18 buses. The regional transport officer said the drivers of the vehicles failed to produce the necessary documents.

 Tapan Haldar, a crew member of MV Satyendra, jumped into the Hooghly on Friday and rescued a 72-year-old passenger who had fallen in. Narayan Chandra Das, a resident of Naskarpara Road, boarded the steamer from Bandhaghat, Salkia, around 4.30pm to visit his daughters home in Girish Park. He fell in midstream.

 Under attack: A tree

 on the EM Bypass withering after being scarred by acid 

 It will be tough to ban the use and sale of tobacco

 on and around campuses (Tobacco ban flouts across campuses, April 10). 

 There has been a sea change in the ambience at educational institutions since the last decade. Youngsters by nature are rebellious and they are more so now. They do not want to follow rules, especially the one pertaining to smoking. 

 Teachers often take the smoking ban casually, in the process encouraging students to adopt the same attitude. 

 The college and university administrations are satisfied by merely instituting the ban. They do not bother to ensure that it is implemented. In the current scenario, I dont see the ban having an effect. 

 Unless students themselves decide to give up the bad habit, they will play hide-and-seek with the authorities and continue to smoke on campuses. 

 Actually, a ban is not needed to stop smoking on the campus. Students should realise that a college or a university is not the place to smoke. If they dont, their education is in vain. 

 Moumita Sengupta,

 Behala. 

 Apropos the report Trees under attack, April 13, it is unfortunate that some unscrupulous people have scant respect for the environment and would not hesitate to poison trees for personal gain. The civic body should take stern measures against outdoor advertising agencies that damage trees for better display of their billboards. 

 Govinda Bakshi,

 Budge Budge. 

 Apropos the report Strike fizzles out on JU campus, April 10, it is a matter of concern that students and employees unions affiliated to political parties are spoiling the atmosphere on the JU campus. The earnest endeavour of the teachers to hold classes must be commended. That the students are getting involved in needless disputes is a sign of their immaturity. The political parties are exploiting them. 

 Sunil Banerjee, 

 VIP Road. 

It was heartening to learn that some NGOs and state government agencies have finally come forward with a plan for rehabilitation of hawkers (Fresh plan for hawkers, April 11). Without a proper rehabilitation blueprint it will not be possible to go ahead with an evacuation drive. The civic body had earlier tried to drive away hawkers from the pavement without much success. As long as their livelihood is not endangered, the hawkers will not mind moving elsewhere. Since the government and the civic body have failed to solve the problem, the court must intervene. 

 Nikhil Agarwal,

 Belur, Howrah. 

 Apropos the report Life term is jail till death, April 3, the apex court ruling is appropriate. Many life convicts secure release from jail by being on their best behaviour. Once out, they go back to crime. Thus, life term should be jail till death. 

 Kabita Roy, 

 Howrah. 

 The report Fuel flows for parked cars, April 7, has not come as a surprise. Theres widespread corruption in the ranks of Calcutta Police. It is common to see men in uniform accept bribes from truck and taxi drivers. When the matter is reported in the media, senior officers feign ignorance and assure people of stringent action. But nothing concrete is done. The report should serve as an eye-opener for the chief minister and the police commissioner. Maybe, the latter should devote more time to police administration than cricket politics. 

 A.S. Mehta, 

 New Alipore. 

 It is wonderful that Australian experts have offered to help in the preservation of Victoria Memorial by use of non-toxic pest control methods (Saving tangible heritage, April 9). The experts can also help in the preservation of Mahabodhi temple in Bodh Gaya, the sun temple in Konarak and other such monuments. 

 Bhupen Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park. 

 Apropos the story Lend me your ear, April 1, all those who travel by autorickshaw have been at some point forced to listen to music played at deafening volumes within the vehicles. If a passenger protests, the driver asks him to take another autorickshaw. 

 M. Zafar Khan,

 Address not given. 

 Apropos Pollution tag on gold unit, April 11, it is distressing that a gold hallmarking factory is causing health hazard to the residents of a congested Burrabazar locality. Residents of other areas in the city where jewellery manufacturing units are located have similar complaints. The state environment ministry should look into the matter. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 Martina Hingis, the tennis player, is Swiss and not Swedish as mentioned in Enter, heart throb from Hyderabad on May 3. The error is regretted.

 Several paintings by eminent and young artists went under the hammer on Sunday afternoon at Yapan Chitra gallery, in Stephens Court, on Park Street, in aid of the Womens Coordinating Council, a nodal agency for 81 member-NGOs working for underprivileged women of the state.

 The auction attracted quite a few guests and others who are active on the social circuit. Although it was meant for charity and had none of the unpredictability of a real sale, there were a few occasions when one guest tried to outbid another. 

 The governor of West Bengal is the chief patron of the Council, established in 1960 by social activist Renuka Ray, and the Council office is located in the Raj Bhavan annexe. It manages old-age homes named Naba Nir, provides legal aid and shelter for rescued victims of trafficking and runs a creche for children. Naba Nir has some free beds.

 This is the first time it has gone in for an auction of art works to raise funds. Forty-two art works are up for sale, of which some were donated, in which case the council will be the sole beneficiary of the auction. Jogen Chowdhury and Wasim Kapur are two artists who have donated their works.

 Among the senior artists whose works were displayed were Paritosh Sen, Sanat Kar, Sarbari Roy Chowdhury and Shanu Lahiri. Sheikh Sahajahan, Sanatan Dinda and Bhaswati Das are among the artists of the younger generation. All the paintings were priced quite reasonably.

 Sundays event was a ceremonial occasion. The auction will continue for the next seven days or so, when those willing to bid can do so privately.

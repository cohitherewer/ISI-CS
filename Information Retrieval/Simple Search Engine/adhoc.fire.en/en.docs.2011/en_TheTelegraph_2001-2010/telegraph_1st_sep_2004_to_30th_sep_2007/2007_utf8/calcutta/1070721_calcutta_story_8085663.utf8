 The director of the School of Tropical Medicine resigned on Friday after being heckled by members of the CPM-backed employees union in his office.

 Around 2pm, 15 men, two of them employees of the institute, barged into the directors room. Dhruba Kumar Neogi, a senior virologist, was with Bhaskar Bhattacharya, the deputy director (blood safety) of the health department, and a quality control official of the blood banks. 

 Neogi identified the two employees as Sukumar Das, a laboratory technician, and Dilip Nandi, a clerk. They are members of the CPM-backed State Employees Coordination Committee. The others were outsiders, but they claimed to be members of the coordination committee, said Neogi. They ordered Bhattacharya and the other official to leave the room so that they could speak to me.

 Neogi asked the men why they had entered his room without an appointment. They replied that they did not need an appointment to enter his office.

 The men alleged that Neogi was not acting on a charter of demands they had submitted to him to solve hospital problems. It is your good luck that we are not breaking the furniture in your room, they allegedly told Neogi.

 They abused me in the filthiest of language. I was too stunned to react. They were behaving like hooligans, said Neogi. 

 He telephoned Jayasree Mitra, the director of medical education, and told her about the incident and that he would resign. 

 They were shouting at the top of their voices even when I was on the phone. Mitra asked me to inform police, but I requested her to do it, said Neogi. 

 The coordination committee members told him that if he really wanted to resign, he should give it in writing. 

 Neogi wrote a two-line resignation letter and faxed it to Mitra, the health minister and the principal secretary of the health department. The group of men wanted a copy of the resignation letter, which I gave them, he said. The men left the room around 2.30pm. 

 According to the director, the two employees do no work and one of them has corruption charges against him. Can they enter the office of the chief minister like this? 

 The State Employees Co-ordination Committee denied the allegations. The men were submitting a charter of demands and did not misbehave, said Jyoti Prasad Bose, the state general secretary of the coordination committee.

 Neogi said he had written to the director of health services about the hospital problems a number of times but there was no response. 

 Mitra said she would speak to Neogi about the incident.

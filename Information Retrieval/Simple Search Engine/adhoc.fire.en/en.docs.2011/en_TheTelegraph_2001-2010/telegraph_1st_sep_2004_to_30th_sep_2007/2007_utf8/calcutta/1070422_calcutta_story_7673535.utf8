The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Wanted: both Sunny, Mandy 

 There should be separate channels for those who want Gavaskar and those who desire Mandira

 A few weeks back, Sanjay Dutt was having Koffee with Karan. Munnabhai was asked what he had learnt during his jail term. Sanjay said that in jail one learns to value freedom. When freedom is taken from you, you realise its value. The philosophy is also evident in other spheres of life less solemn. 

 One such area is consumer choice. There was a time when the doors of the Indian economy resembled the Buland Darwaza. Then came the mid-80s and the doors mutated to a push-and-enter kind. Over the next two decades, for almost every product or service, competition became the rule. Consumers started living with a secure belief if Peter does not Paul will. This habit makes us sulk now whenever our freedom to choose is taken away. 

 The telecast of the cricket World Cup has made some of us sulk. Some years ago, Sony bagged the television rights for all ICC tournaments. It wanted to broad-base the appeal and brought in oomph through the now famous spaghetti tops of Mandira Bedi (picture above). The aim was simple get the casual cricket-viewer to watch more cricket. That worked. Sony has been laughing all the way to the bank. 

 The serious viewer, however, has found the experience irksome. Many found Mandira asking a cricket question to Ian Chappell sacrilegious. Sometime experts on the show made statements like: India has to do three things to win bat well, bowl well and field well. The cricket-lover, therefore, sulks.

 In the next World Cup, the telecast rights would move to ESPN Star Sports. Chances are that there will be meatier discussions on television, between Gavaskar (picture below with Rahul Dravid) and Shastri, Akram and Symcox. And then it will be the turn of the other group to feel let down. They will miss Mandira Bedi. 

 In either situation one group will miss what constitutes cricket entertainment. The current practice of ICC is to award the telecast rights to a single channel. The channel that wins the contract will then buy the beam from a production company along with the commentary. All that remains for them to do is to add a show to the telecast and there they are, up and running. And more Mandira in the show better it is for the TRP. 

 There is nothing wrong with this. Creating a product that a majority of your viewers want is what the doctor orders. The real point is is the viewer singular or plural? 

 From all indications there are at least two viewer segments. Therefore can more than one product be created from the same match and televised simultaneously? 

 Then all those who desire Mandira, can enjoy her company by tuning to the right channel. So can all others who prefer a Ravi Shastri or a Sunny Gavaskar. In this day and age of DTH television, like a movie on demand, cant we order cricket experts of our choice? 

 Of course we must understand that all this will be for a fee. There are no free lunches.

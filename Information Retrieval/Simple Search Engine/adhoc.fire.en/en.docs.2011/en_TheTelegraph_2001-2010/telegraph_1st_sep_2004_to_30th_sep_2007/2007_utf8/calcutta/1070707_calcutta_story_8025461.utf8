The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Career block, penury fear drive model to suicide

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Angelin Laha: Goodbye cruel world. A Telegraph picture

 The great Indian dream has gone horribly wrong in a Laha bari of Howrah.

 Angelin, the younger daughter of the 1 Brindaban Mullick Lane house, was found hanging from the ceiling of her bedroom on Friday morning. Preliminary findings hinted at suicide caused by frustration and the fear of penury.

 The 21-year-old was a model who failed to make much headway. Just like her elder sister Alice had failed to make a mark as a disc jockey (DJ).

 The failure of the two girls to make it even after pumping precious family finances into their new-age pursuits pushed the household to the brink three years after the death of Prabuddha Laha.

 The former Congress MLA from Asansol (1987-1991) died in September 2004, plunging wife Roma and daughters Alice and Angelin into a crisis that deepened with every passing month.

 Till Angelin who spent months pushing her portfolio as an aspiring model in vain could take it no more, and allegedly ended her life on Friday morning.

 We will have to follow in the footsteps of Angelin if we fail to sell this house within a couple of months. We have no source of income. We have sold all our furniture. The money left in the bank will just about see us through for the next three months, lamented mother Roma.

 Elder daughter Alice sat silently in a bare room where the writing was on the wall Suicide is Gods gift in Hell... Goodbye cruel world... I have become comfortably numb...

 Angelin felt this way, but she didnt write all this; I did. I am going to follow my sister soon, mumbled Alice.

 We have no money to buy clothes or a proper meal. My sister had tried to slash her wrists and pop sleeping pills before. Today, she succeeded in ending her suffering.

 On Friday morning, Angelin woke up, chatted with her mother and sister over a cup of tea, went to the market to buy fish for her eight pet cats, fed them and then entered her bedroom.

 Around 9.30am, her friend Sanskar Mahato, 24, found her hanging from the ceiling. By the time we unfastened the noose and brought her down, she was dead, said Roma.

 A police probe revealed how substantial sums of money were spent on grooming Angelin the model and training Alice the DJ. But it all came to naught.

 She refused to compromise her dignity, while her colleagues stooped to any level for a modelling assignment. My daughter believed she could make it on her talent alone. She was wrong, rued Roma.

 Police said the preliminary post-mortem on Saturday would reveal the cause of death.

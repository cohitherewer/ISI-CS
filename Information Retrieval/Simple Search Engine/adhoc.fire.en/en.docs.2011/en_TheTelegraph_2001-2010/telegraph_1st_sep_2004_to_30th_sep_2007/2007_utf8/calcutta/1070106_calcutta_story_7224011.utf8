 Enter, Adlabs. Come February-end and the multiplex chain will debut in this part of the world with a three-screen theatre in the heart of tech town.

 RDB-Adlabs will be housed in the sprawling eight-storeyed RDB Boulevard in Sector V, Salt Lake.

 After establishing its presence in the western part of the country, Adlabs comes to town with a 1,034-seat multiplex divide with three halls.

 The latest entrant to the citys multiplex mart promises the latest in projection systems, digital sound and interiors for better cinema-viewing experience.

 To make things easy, special phone and Internet booking facilities will also be made available.

 An initiative of the RDB Organisation, which has tied up with Adlabs Films to set up a film processing and production unit in the city, the multiplex will be on the second and third floors.

 Isnt RDB-Adlabs too close to 89 Cinemas and INOX (City Centre) for comfort? 

 Kamal Bansal, director of the RDB Organisation, disagrees: RDB-Adlabs is in completely different territory. It has the advantage of Nalban and Nicco Park, which are within walking distance of the Boulevard. Also, there is the 24x7 crowd in Sector V that is young, with flexi-timings and disposable income. The multiplex should be a welcome addition for them.

 Situated on a corner plot behind Infinity building, RDB Boulevard will house an office workstation and an entertainment zone on the same premises, spread over 200, 000 sq ft, including a basement with parking space for around 85 cars and additional provision next to the kerb.

 RDB Boulevard is a multi-utility complex, which will cater to people from all areas, meeting both their needs of purpose and pleasure, assured Bansal.

 The ground floor, with four spacious showrooms, will house the Crossword bookstore and Infinitea tea bar.

 The first floor has been divided into two sections. One side will host a food court called Adda, comprising a chain of popular eateries for a quick bite or a leisurely meal, while a club-like ambience will prevail on the other side, where people can unwind in the plush interiors of the Essential Lounge. A Sports Bar next to the lounge boasts a gym and gaming facilities.

 The five-level workstation from the fourth to the eighth floor, over 25,000 sq ft each, has been reserved for information technology (IT) and other offices. An individual entrance and an exclusive lobby with four high-speed elevators will separate the office block from the amusement zone. 

 There will be two more individual entrances, one leading to the showroom and another to the food court and multiplex.

 Built on a budget of nearly Rs 50 crore, the Boulevard has been designed by Calcutta-based architect Mukul Mitra and Era Architects of Mumbai, marked by a soaring glossy glass front.

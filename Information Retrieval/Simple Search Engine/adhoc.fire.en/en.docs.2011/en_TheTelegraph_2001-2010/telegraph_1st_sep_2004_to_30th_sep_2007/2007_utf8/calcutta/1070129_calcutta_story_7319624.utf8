 Foara dutta, RSP councillor of Calcutta Municipal Corporations ward number 40, met readers of The Telegraph and answered their queries. 

Participants included Saptarsi Ghosh, Chirantan Dawn, Sandeep Banerjee, Jitendranath Das, Kiran Laha, Asim Swarnakar, Sabita Datta, Paresh Halder and Bijoy Bose

Kiran Laha: A few years back, it was proposed that Beniatola Lane will be renamed after Baren Dawn. Baren Dawn was the founder-leader of the former Left students wing Bangiya Pradeshik Students Federation. He also worked in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) between 1952 and 1972 and participated in the freedom struggle. Are you doing something about it? Why is the project still pending? 

 I will certainly take up the matter with the mayor. Moreover, I think the name should be changed at once, since it is derived from the name of a particular caste. 

Jitendranath Das: Can you suggest a way out of the persistent waterlogging problem in our area? I feel deposits of silt and polythene bags in the sewer lines is the main cause. Urgent de-silting work should be carried out in the College Street area.

 Waterlogging has become a daily feature in our lives. Since my childhood, I have seen roads like Amherst Street, College Street, Sitaram Ghosh Street, College Row and Surya Sen Street go under knee-deep water after every shower.

 You are right that deposits of silt in the sewer pipes is the main cause. Polythene bags create a major problem. Last year, while clearing the roads after the showers, we saw polythene bags had choked the pipelines.

 The de-silting operation is now on and the sewer lines would be re-layed under the Jawharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. I hope that the situation will improve by 2008.

 Sabita Datta: I must congratulate you for your excellent effort to control dengue and malaria in our ward. Will you continue the door-to-door campaign in the near future?

 Intensive campaign against dengue and malaria is the only way to tackle the mosquito menace. We must and will continue with it. A single case of dengue or malignant malaria was not detected this year in our ward. We should thank you because it was impossible without your cooperation and support. 

Sandeep Banerjee: Political leaders win our votes by giving fake assurances about slum development. But in reality, there is no improvement in the lives of the slum dwellers. 

 Who told you that slum development has not been taken up in our ward? There are slums in Raja Lane, Narasingha Lane and on Keshab Sen Street. In my ward, of 22,000 voters 12, 000 live in slums. To improve the sanitary situation, walls of the toilets have been built. Broken doors have been replaced and lights have been installed for use at night. 

Chirantan Dawn: There is a serious water supply problem in Tamer Lane and in the adjacent areas of 80 Mahatma Gandhi Road. Please help. 

 The pipelines in this area are very old. Therefore, the pipes leak due to wear and tear. This is causing low pressure and hence, water shortage. Like water supply was a major problem in Raja Lane. When engineers excavated the road, they found that the pipeline had holes in some places. The situation improved as soon as the pipes were changed. The funds for the renovation have already been sanctioned and the re-laying work will start in a few months.

Asim Swarnakar: An eight-cottah plot on Amherst Street is lying vacant and is in a shambles. Are you doing something about it? 

 I have a beautification scheme, which is worth Rs 1.1 lakh, but a few local residents are against it. The project includes a paved path for morning-walkers, fountains and a childrens park.

Bijoy Bose: The civic schools in the area are gradually disappearing.

 The dropping student count is the main reason behind closure of the schools. There were five CMC schools in the area. Now, there is just one in Kanai Dhar Lane. The student count is 30, of whom just 15 attend the classes daily. It was a Hindi-medium school and I have converted it into a Bengali-medium primary school.

Saptarsi Ghosh: It is difficult for pedestrians to walk down Raja Lane and Nabin Pal Lane after sunset due to lack of proper street lights. Will you look into the matter?

 I have got similar complaints from others too. I have informed the lighting department. We always inform them on time but it seems the department is not working properly. I will take up the matter with the mayor.

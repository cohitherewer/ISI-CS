 Piracy boom despite raids

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Pirated DVDs, VCDs and MP3 discs, worth Rs 2,77,000, were seized in BBD Bag and Chandni Chowk over Friday and Saturday.

 On August 17, the detective department seized 520 DVDs including 33 of Chak De India, which was released the week before and 632 MP3 discs, worth Rs 1,11,000, from BBD Bag and arrested 22-year-old Mohammad Ali. 

 Later, Noor Mohammad Mollah, who had 1,115 pirated MP3 CDs of Hindi, English and Bengali songs on him, was arrested.

 On August 18, Sheikh Firdaus was arrested in Chandni Chowk and 350 DVDs and 95 VCDs, worth Rs 68,000, were seized from him. Sheikh Sajid was arrested in the same area with 499 DVDs and 232 VCDs, worth Rs 98,500.

 The police have seized more than 40,000 pirated discs and arrested over 65 people in the past year with little effect on piracy. The problem is not restricted to pockets like Fancy Market and Chandni Chowk. Hawkers sell pirated discs in the open on major thoroughfares. 

 The business thrives because buyers are not hard to come by. Buying pirated discs is cheaper than even renting the original ones. For Rs 75, I get to keep three movies, instead of paying caution money and Rs 50 to watch only one by renting it from a parlour, said an IT professional working in Sector V.

 If the companies came forward more often, it would be easier to control the menace of piracy, said Ajay Kumar, the deputy commissioner (detective department).

 People from the entertainment industry, on the other hand, feel regular raids and criminal cases against offenders would help control piracy.

 The police conducts raids only occasionally. Piracy should be a criminal offence, since it affects collection of sales, income and amusement taxes, said Arijit Dutta, a distributor and cinema-owner. 

 According to him, the industry suffers 60 per cent revenue loss because of piracy. 

 If piracy is not controlled, the industry might soon be in trouble, said Sandip Chaudhuri, business unit controller (east) of RPG Enterprises (entertainment sector). Most of the pirated discs come from outside the country. So, we need to crack down on those who sell them here, he added.

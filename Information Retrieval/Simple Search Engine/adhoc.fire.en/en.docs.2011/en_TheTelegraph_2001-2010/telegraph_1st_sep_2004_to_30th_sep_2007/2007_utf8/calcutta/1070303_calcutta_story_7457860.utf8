 For months, thousands of passengers are being forced to wade through sewage at Bidhannagar Road railway station in Ultadanga. The subway between platforms two and four remains flooded almost all year. The problem is particularly acute in monsoon.

 We have to cross the subway balancing ourselves on bricks. The ordeal has been continuing for at least four months, complained Asim Ghosh, a daily commuter. Earlier, the situation was not as bad there would be waterlogging only on the sides of the subway. As the railway authorities did not take steps to solve the problem, the entire subway is inundated now.

 According to records, nearly 20,000 passengers visit the station every day.

 Leaks in drainpipes near a platform result in waterlogging, explained station officials.

 I cannot cross the subway balancing on bricks. So I have to climb up to the platform and take the other staircase to come out of the station, said 65-year-old Chitra Chatterjee, who lives in Ultadanga.

 A colleague sprained his ankle while jumping from one brick to another in the subway. He could not attend office for a fortnight, said Arun Das, an employee of Ichhapur Gun and Shell Factory.

 Khokan Dutta, a member of a railway passengers association, said the organisation had informed the station master of Bidhannagar Road several times about the problem, but no action has been taken.

 The railway authorities said they were aware of the problem. I know there is waterlogging in the subway between platforms two and four. Earlier, there was a waterlogging problem between platforms one and two. We expect to solve the problem soon, said Swapan Mondal, divisional railway manager, Sealdah.

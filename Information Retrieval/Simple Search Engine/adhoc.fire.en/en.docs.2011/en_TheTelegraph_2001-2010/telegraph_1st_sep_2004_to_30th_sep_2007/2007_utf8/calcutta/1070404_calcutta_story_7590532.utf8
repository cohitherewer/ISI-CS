 - BLIND PILOTS FEAT

 Once told that he could never fly because of bad eyesight, Miles Hilton-Barber is now achieving the remarkable by becoming the first blind man to fly a Microlight from London to Sydney. Now, 37 years later and blind as a bat, I have this wonderful opportunity and privilege to fly half-way round the world.

 Hilton-Barber, 58, is conducting this flight in association with StandardChartered Bank, which has incorporated his flight into its Seeing is Believing drive, aimed at raising $10 million by World Sight Day in 2010. He hopes the adventure will raise 1 million.

 A motivational speaker by trade, Hilton-Barber lost his sight to a genetic condition as a young man. But he has spent much of his life performing extraordinary feats, from climbing Mount Kilimanjaro to hauling a sledge 250 miles across the Antarctica.

 Aided by sighted co-pilot Richard Meredith-Hardy, whose brief is to assist him in rough conditions and during an emergency landing, Hilton-Barber set out from London on March 7 on a journey that will follow the route of the classic 1919 London-Sydney Air Race. 

 Hilton-Barber has traversed Europe, the Mediterranean, and through West Asia and Pakistan. 

 He and his team arrived in Calcutta on their last leg through India, before carrying on to Dhaka. They had earlier stopped at Raipur.

 Hilton-Barber has been enjoying his stops in India. I love the food and the culture here. Although, I wont mention anything about the World Cup!

 A Microlight, being used for the journey, is a tiny aircraft that is designed to accommodate only a pilot and a co-pilot. Because of the size, the aircraft is much more vulnerable to turbulence. We are also much more exposed to the elements. While landing in Jordan, all our instruments and clothing were thick with ice, which was quite dangerous, recalled Hilton-Barber.

 Hilton-Barber is particularly keen that India recognises what has to be done. 

 India has the greatest concentration of blind people in the world. Many of these cases of blindness are preventable. It costs very little to operate on a child with cataracts, he said. The money a family spends on dinner in a restaurant could change a persons life... Whilst I will never see again in this life, helping to give this priceless gift back to many others through our flight will make it all worthwhile.

 Bridge revamp leaves road closed

 Renovation of the Beleghata bridge has left a stretch of Beleghata Main Road, from Sarkar Bazar to Khanna School, out of bounds for vehicles.

 Traffic bound for Beleghata or EM Bypass is being diverted through Palmer Bazar.

 This is the first time that the civic authorities have taken up bridge revamp work on a busy road, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay. The bridge is actually an extension of the century-old Beleghata railway bridge.

 Deputy chief engineer (civil) Soumitra Bhattacharya said: The road has been closed following talks with deputy commissioner (traffic) Manoj Verma. Though we have taken time till September 20 to keep the road closed, I hope work will be over by Bishwakarma puja (September 17).

 Till the bridge is reopened, vehicles bound for Beleghata or the Bypass from Sealdah will ply straight towards Palmer Bazar. Beleghata-bound vehicles will take a left turn, towards Beleghata Main Road, at Barafkal (near the Sales Tax office) and Bypass-bound vehicles will take Chaulpatty Road or Canal South Road.

 Mayoral council member (roads) Tuhin Bera said the concrete bridge will be at a height of 15 ft from the ground, while the road on it will be 50-ft wide. The original bridge was of concrete corrugated sheets.

 The civic authorities decided to reconstruct the bridge because of the rise in the load-bearing capacity of vehicles. The weight-bearing capacity of the revamped bridge will be Class-A which means a vehicle carrying load up to 70 tonnes can ply on it.

 But why has the Calcutta Municipal Corporation taken up reconstruction of a bridge owned by the railways?

 We had approached the railways but there was no positive response, prompting us to take up the project ourselves, said Bera.

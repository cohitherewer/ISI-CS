 The final Oscar nominations will be announced on Tuesday at around 7 pm, our time. We do a little forward trading and try to zero in on the final five on the Best Actor list. So, here goes the nomination for the nominations...

 Leonardo DiCaprio better be there for his sterling performances in The Departed or/and Blood Diamond. And knowing the sympathy factor playing on the minds of the Oscar voters, Leos not winning for The Aviator is sure to play a role this time.

 Peter OToole had warned, Im still in the game, when the Academy gave him an honourary Oscar in 2003. This may be his year with Venus, where he plays an old man smitten by a teenager.

 Forest Whitaker is the overwhelming favourite for his chilling performance as Idi Amin in The Last King of Scotland. Having won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture (Drama), he is as close as it gets to the golden statuette.

 Will Smith for his most mature performance (since Ali in 2002) in The Pursuit of Happyness alongside his son. He lost out at the Golden Globes but the Oscars may turn out to be happier hunting ground.

 Ryan Gosling for his role as a schoolteacher with a drug problem in Half Nelson. If he does make it to the nomination list, he will be the youngest on the list at 26.

 Sacha Baron Cohen may be in with a chance because everybody loved Borat. But since the Academy has a notorious aversion to comedians, Cohen remains a rank outsider. His Golden Globe award may help.

 Ken Watanabe could well be come the first Japanese actor ever to be nominated for an Oscar, for his performance in Clint Eastwoods Letters from Iwo Jima. Dont bet against it.

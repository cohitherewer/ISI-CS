 Portrait of an artist

 Considered to be the most experimental among the French New Wave directors, Jacques Rivette emerged on the cinema horizon out of the post-war milieu of movie-love in Paris. His deliberately challenging, super-size films defy easy assimilation, demanding a level of attention unusual to the works of his contemporaries. They possess an intellectual inquiry and humanity unmatched in the French cinema of his time. This evening, the French Association hosts the screening of Rivettes masterpiece La Belle Noiseuse, as part of an ongoing retrospective of his films. Examining an artists creative process, it portrays the inner life of its protagonist Edouard Frenhofer, a renowned painter in the throes of artistic withdrawal.

 lEvent: Screening of French film La Belle Noiseuse lWhen: Today at 6 pm lWhere: The French Association Library

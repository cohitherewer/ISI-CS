 A call to save Sunderbans

 Apart from other problems, the land of the Royal Bengal Tiger now has its fragile ecosystem under assault. 

 Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi released a book authored by a group of wildlife enthusiasts on Wednesday, which attempts to capture the diversity of flora and fauna in the Sunderbans and highlights the problems of the region. 

 The Sundarbans Inheritance is authored by Bittu Sahgal, Sumit Sen (who sighted the rare large-billed reed warbler at the Chintamani Kar sanctuary for the first time in India after 139 years) and Bikram Grewal. The book, that combines articles by the three authors with photographs by several contributors, is the third in a series that includes the Kaziranga and Bharatpur sanctuaries.

 Remarking on the fragility of the ecosystem of the Sunderbans, Gandhi recalled an interaction with local people of Sagar island, for whom concerns like electricity, embankments and a bridge connecting them to the mainland were more immediate than conserving wildlife. Any effort at conservation must be in conjunction with the local peoples needs, Gandhi said. 

 Grewal lauded the efforts of the forest department officials who battle against great odds that include organised networks of poachers and tree-fellers equipped with sophisticated weapons and the latest technology. 

 Despite problems, the ecosystem of the Sunderbans remains largely untouched. But we have to be prepared as things are changing fast, he said.

 Sen, who has been going to the Sunderbans regularly for the past five years, said: The main problems assailing the forest are the decreasing supply of sweet water, pollution, the decline in mangrove cover and human encroachment. Indian sanctuaries today are isolated islands. We need contiguous wildlife sanctuaries for conservation to be effective.

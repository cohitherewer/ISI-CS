The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Missing link in a tunnel

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The severe water crisis, affecting two lakh people in south Calcutta, east Calcutta, Garden Reach and Behala, will soon ease with the setting up of a 150-metre pipe link under the Majherhat railway bridge.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has started work on Wednesday to lay the dedicated pipeline between Garden Reach Waterworks and the booster pumping stations at Garfa, Ranikuthi and Kalighat.

 We couldnt lay the pipe under the railway tracks as the tunnel through which the pipe would pass was not ready. Now that the tunnel is in place, we have started work, said mayoral council member (water supply) Mrinal Kanti Mondal.

 The tunnel through which the pipe will pass has been laid under nine railway tracks at a cost Rs 42 crore.

 The Ranikuthi reservoir, however, is far from sufficient and the CMC is indifferent to its expansion, complained residents of five wards, including mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyyas ward, who dont receive surface filtered water.

 We were promised that we would be given surface filtered water from the Ranikuthi reservoir, but we are yet to get it. We have no option but to have water from deep tubewells, said Sanat Goswami, a Naktala resident.

 The civic body is indifferent to the problems of the people living here, said Debobrata Mazumdar, councillor, Bijoygarh. Last year, Rs 2 crore was sanctioned for the expansion of the reservoir. This year, too, the same amount has been sanctioned but no work has been done so far, alleged Mazumdar.

 Mondal, however, denied the charges. We need some time to chalk out the expansion plan. Work on the reservoir will begin by December.

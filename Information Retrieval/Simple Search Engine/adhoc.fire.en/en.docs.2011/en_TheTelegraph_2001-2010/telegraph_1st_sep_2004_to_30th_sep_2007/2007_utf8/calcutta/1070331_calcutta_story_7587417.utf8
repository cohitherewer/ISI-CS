 Cup catastrophe bowls out film

 - First day, first show of cricket movie scrapped for lack of viewers

 2.45 pm, 89 Cinemas (Swabhumi): Three people stroll in to watch the new release of the week the cricket movie Say Salaam India. Five minutes into the film, they say theyve had enough and want to be shifted to a screen showing another film. The request kept, the first day, first show of Say Salaam India is run out.

 The Team India axe effect is at work. Anything but cricket seems to be the viewer vote as Hattrick a film on the heroines Dhoni fixation struggles to stay at the crease in Week III and Say Salaam India fails to even get off the mark.

 If the opening show at 89 Cinemas had to be scrapped barely after the opening credits had rolled, the second show at Fame (Hiland Park) was a no-show due to below-five occupancy. The shows that did manage to take stance, showed to around six people (2.10 pm, Fame) and 15 people (7.55 pm, 89 Cinemas).

 Something like this has never happened, admitted Mahendra Soni of Shree Venkatesh Films, distributing the film on behalf of Adlabs. Team India not making it to the Super 8 in the World Cup has hit this film very hard. Even at Elite theatre, the response was very bad. We will have to track the turnout for the next couple of days and then, perhaps, take the film off the screens.

 Say Salaam India, starring Sanjay Suri and Milind Soman, revolves around cricket at the school level and how corruption and talent collide.

 Metro caught up with one of the few people who sat through Say Salaam India. The film is not as bad as the numbers suggest, argued Madhu Das. But when the young cricketers in the movie look to Team India for inspiration, the blood really boils!

 Its not that shows have not been cancelled before, but never has aversion to cricket been the cause. Early morning and late-night shows have sometimes been cancelled with no one turning up, reveals a source in a city plex. And then there was the infamous show at Fame (Hiland Park) where just one die-hard fan had caught Dev Anands Mr Prime Minister. No such luck for Say Salaam India, caught and bowled by Team Indias Cup catastrophe.

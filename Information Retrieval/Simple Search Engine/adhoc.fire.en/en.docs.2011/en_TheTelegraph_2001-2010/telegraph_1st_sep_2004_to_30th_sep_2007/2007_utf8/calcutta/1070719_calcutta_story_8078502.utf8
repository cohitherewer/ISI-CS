 Beyond classrooms

 Education is not just a classroom affair but goes beyond that. A team of 16 American teachers of elementary, middle and secondary schools visited the city to survey local schools and develop new methods of education back home.

 Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) was the stopover for the team (picture

 II. The team was on a four-day

 tour that started from July 11.

 The programme would contemplate

 the scope of education beyond classrooms. 

 Education in India is more classroom-based, remarked Amanda Clapp of Cullowhee Valley School. Everyone present at the seminar, including the coordinators and the director of BITM, Jayanta Sthanapati, agreed that more non-formal education is required to improve the education system in both countries. Taking them out of claustrophobic classrooms will make learning fun and help broaden their perspective, agreed all. 

 Mark Skelton, a teacher at Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom High School, New York, spoke about the way his students were involved in water sampling at the local Bronx river. They even use self-made boats. This direct approach helps them learn better, said Skelton. 

 Agreed Clapp: I involve my students in monitoring the water quality of the local watershed area. The state department works on the data. Practical handling teaches more than theoretical learning can ever do.

 Shirley Jou of Alexander Rose Elementary shared her experience with non-English speaking students. They are more sensitive. So I use figures and models of planets while teaching astronomy. Field trips and frequent visits to museums make learning interesting beyond the classroom, agreed all. 

 The team, having met delegates from NCERT at New Delhi, also stopped over at other cities, including Varanasi, Chennai, Kochi and Mumbai.

Is India obsessed with Bollywood? This was the subject of this years L.N. Birla inter-institutional debate. 

 The east-zone finals of the debate, in its eighth year, was held on July 11 at Vidya Mandir auditorium. Fourteen schools and colleges participated in the event, with separate sessions for the school and college teams. The participating schools included La Martiniere School for Boys (LMB), Lakshmipat Singhania Academy (LSA), Hill Top School (Jamshedpur), DAV Public School (Bhubaneswar) and Birla High School for Boys. The judges were Kunal Padhi, Samarjeet Guha, and Veena Lakhumalani. 

 With Bollywood as the subject of contention, the fight was bound to get interesting. Rishab Surana of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy said: In spite of a girlish appearance, Aamir Khan is one of the most popular heroes in the country. What can you call this except obsession? Siddhant Issar of LMB remarked: In India, where so many live below the poverty line, who has time to ponder on what John Abraham has for lunch? 

 The other part of the show had a total of seven colleges including Calcutta Medical College, Jadavpur University (JU), Heramba Chandra College, Presidency College, NUJS, Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society. 

 The participants seemed unable to remark on anything save the Abhi-Ash wedding. But Anirban Majumdar of JU chose to walk a different path: It is sad that Bachchans farmer issue is given more preference by the media compared to the Orissa hunger tragedy, he said. 

 Does India mean only a glittering glamour world that Bollywood portrays it to be? questioned Amit Bhauwala, a student of Calcutta Medical College, whereas Manbeer Singh Patra of Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society, speaking for the motion, frequently broke into Himesh Reshamiyya numbers to illustrate his point. 

 The judges chose La Martiniere School for Boys and NUJS as the champions in the school and college sections respectively, while Vinayak Banerjee of LSA and Sakshi Arora of Presidency College were chosen the best speakers. The winners will represent the east zone in the national finals to be held in mid-November.

 The Diary

 A Night to Mourn

 As she

 was so frail, 

 Could

 she have

 Shortened

 the span of the night? 

 Outside

 the semi-dark room, 

 Where

 the gloomy sky, 

 Pitch

 dark in hue

 Was

 measuring the uncertainty

 of time? 

 Inside

 the room 

 The

 lady, pale and fair,

 Remained

 uncertain of where she was. 

 When will

 the ray of hope 

 Light

 up the sky, 

 Making

 an outcaste of the spell of horror?

 Can he breathe till the end? 

 She

 thought.

 She

 neared his heart, her senses

 registering every beat.

 It still

 beats, she felt assured. 

 But it

 was a stormy night. 

 A

 sudden gust of wind made her shiver.

 The

 lamp broke, flames leaped,

 She

 jumped, reaching out to protect

 him. 

 The

 tongues of fire would have taken

 him,

 If

 they had not extinguished themselves.

 As the

 first colour of dawn painted 

 the horizon

 She

 came near to him:

 Did

 his heart beat yet? 

 She couldnt

 assure herself this time. 

 A cry

 rang out,

 Increasing in intensity

 with the first light of a new day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 After idle days, cry of deceit

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Maidan, 2.30 pm. The Book Fair venue looks like an idle junkyard, with bamboo poles, plywood sheets and workers lying around. Some are sitting in a huddle waiting to know when or whether to get back to work. Publishers and Booksellers Guild officials are pacing up and down, cellphones glued to the ear.

 Maidan, 5 pm. Afternoon siesta gives way to evening scurry. Labourers are seen rushing to decorators. Decorators are seen frantically calling up Guild officials. The breaking news is in the high court has said no to Book Fair 2007 on the Maidan.

 We have been misguided by the Guild. They should have given us the true picture about the Book Fair before telling us to start erecting the stalls. Now, we will have to remove all our material from the Maidan. We have incurred huge financial losses, complained Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury of Modern Decorators.

 The feeling that they had been taken for a ride by the organisers of Book Fair 2007 dominated the mood among the workers on the Maidan on Monday evening.

 We brought in more labourers and made them work in shifts to meet the deadline. Now who will bear the losses? demanded a furious decorator listed with the Guild. We should have been told from Day One that the necessary permissions for the fair had not been taken and the court verdict could stop work. Why were we kept in the dark? he demanded to know.

 The work force, idle for five days since the high court slammed the brakes on the mauling of the Maidan, must now undo all that it has done. 

 Calcutta High Court, after all, has given the Guild seven days to restore and return the Maidan to its original condition.

 We have been told to dismantle everything, fill up the holes and level the grounds. After that, we must leave the Maidan, said a decorators worker from Contai.

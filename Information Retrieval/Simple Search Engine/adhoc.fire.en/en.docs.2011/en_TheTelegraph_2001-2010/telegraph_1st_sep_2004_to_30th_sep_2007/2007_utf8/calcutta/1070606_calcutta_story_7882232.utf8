 Gang bust before break-in

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Ten members of a 12-member gang that had burgled shops across the country were arrested on Ripon Street on Tuesday afternoon. Two of the gang members escaped.

 The burglars, in their mid-30s, had gathered before an operation they had planned in the area.

 We have found that the gang carried out burglaries in most of the big cities in India. They generally stole cellphones and clothes. In Calcutta, they had burgled several shops, including one in Jorasanko and two in Burrabazar, said city detective chief Gyanwant Singh.

 The leader of the gang was identified as Mohammad Faruque, 35, a resident of Islampur Chowk in Sitamari district of Bihar.

 Two revolvers, some ammunition, three choppers, a knife and the sketch of an area in south Calcutta were found on the gang members. One of them, Mohammad Moon Tanvir of Sitamari district, is a graduate.

 A detective department officer said: The gang would take orders from a section of businessmen along the Nepal border in Bihar. They then carried out a survey to identify showrooms stocking the goods they needed. The men would hire a taxi late at night and make rounds of the area. They generally broke in between 2am and 3am. 

 The police found out about the gang after arresting some receivers from the Nepal border in Howrah a few months ago.

 The gang had taken away cellphones and cash worth Rs 12 lakh-plus from a shop on Tarachand Dutta Street in March. The phones were sold off to businessmen in Nepal, said the police.

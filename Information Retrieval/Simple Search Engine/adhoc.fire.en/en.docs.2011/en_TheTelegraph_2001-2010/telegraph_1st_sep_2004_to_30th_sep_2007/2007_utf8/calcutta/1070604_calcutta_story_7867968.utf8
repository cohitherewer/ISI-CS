 Web frauds target women

 - Cyber crime wing flooded with complaints

 PRONAB MONDAL

 The popularity of online social networks has come at a price. Last month, 35 young women lodged complaints with the Lalbazar cyber crime wing about damaging profiles put up on the websites.

 The complainants range from students to employees of reputed private firms. The profiles created without their knowledge contain photographs and personal details that can be viewed by other members of the network concerned. Most of the profiles also provide landline and cellphone numbers of the women. 

 Two of the victims found their photographs morphed with those of nude women and put up on display. 

 I received several calls on my cellphone from people I didnt know. They said they had found my number on Orkut (the most popular online social network). I immediately went through the profile they were referring to. It had been created about a week ago without my permission and contained every personal detail, including my phone number, said Paramita (name changed on request). She lodged a complaint at Lalbazar on Wednesday. 

 Deputy commissioner of the detective department Gyanwant Singh said: The impersonators made lewd statements in the self-description section of the profiles. The complainants image has been tarnished by the fake profiles.

 Fake profiles on social networking sites started making news from last year. The chief minister was one victim. Sleuths found three profiles on Orkut that bore Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees photographs and name. 

 The websites headquarters in New York deleted the profiles after the police got in touch with them.

 Naseem Ali, who heads the cyber crime wing, said: Most of the complainants are members of Orkut. The impersonators used the photographs on the real profile to create a fake one. Fake profiles were also put up on other online social networks.

 He added: It is clear that the culprits know the victims, so tracking them down will not be a problem. The arrest of the culprits is only a matter of time.

 The police assured the victims that their fake profiles would be deleted from the websites in a couple of days.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tinderboxes in waiting

 In the wake of the blaze in Telephone Bhavan,

 Metro visited three government offices, where thousands work and lakhs

 visit, on Wednesday to check how prepared they are to tackle a fire.

 Here rsquo;s what we found

 In the wake of the blaze in Telephone Bhavan, Metro visited three government offices, where thousands work and lakhs visit, on Wednesday to check how prepared they are to tackle a fire. Heres what we found

 Where: The

 sprawling Bikash Bhavan in Salt Lake, where more than

 5,000 people work and a handful of ministers have their

 offices. 

 What we saw: Fire extinguishers are hidden in remote corners of the office. There are no professionals around to take charge if a fire breaks out. On every floor, naked wires are hanging from various places and vendors are preparing and selling snacks like boiled eggs, poach and tea. The chance of a fire breaking out in the office is very high. There was a minor fire a few days back. We doused the flames ourselves. There is nobody to tackle an emergency. Moreover, there is no awareness among the employees. We do not know how to use a fire-extinguisher, says a senior employee of the higher education department. 

 Where: The New Secretariat Building on Kiran Shankar Roy Road.

 What we saw: The scenes are no different from Bikash Bhavan. There are naked wires hanging from various places. The fire extinguishers have to be found out. Most of them cannot be seen because they are hidden behind heaps of broken furniture or cardboard cartons. There are hooks on the walls but the water pipes are missing. The people working in the building realise the danger they face. We work on the seventh floor. If a fire breaks out, well be trapped, says a PHE engineer.

 Where: The Directorate of Commercial Taxes in Beleghata.

 What we saw: The condition of the multi-storeyed buildings, where more than 3,000 people work, is the worst of the lot. The fire extinguishers have not been inspected or re-filled for many years. The water pipes are hanging from the hooks but a thick layer of dust covers them, which indicates that there has been no fire drill in the buildings for years. Here too, there are vendors on every floor. But the authorities do not realise the danger. We have never had a major fire. And there are fire extinguishers on every floor, says Shailesh Sen, one of the officials responsible for the upkeep of the building.

 The monsoon will reach the city by Wednesday, declared Met officials on Monday. 

 The monsoon current moved into north Bengal on Sunday and has remained stationary since. Met officials, however, believe that a trough of low pressure over Gangetic Bengal has created conditions favourable for the monsoon to advance from the northern to the southern districts of the state.

 Other atmospheric conditions are also favourable for the arrival of the rains in Calcutta. A southerly wind from the Bay of Bengal is blowing through south Bengal. At the same time, the atmospheric pressure has fallen over Madhya Pradesh and adjoining Chhattisgarh. These factors will strengthen the trough of low pressure, explained a Met official.

 We expect the monsoon to hit Calcutta and the rest of Gangetic Bengal in the next 48 hours, stated G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore on Monday.

 The monsoon usually reaches Calcutta around June 8. It will arrive late this year. The monsoon current arrived in Kerala on May 28. Its progress has been slow, said the Met official. A trough of low pressure over sub-Himalayan Bengal pulled the monsoon to the Northeast last Friday. On Sunday, it moved to north Bengal.

 The low pressure over south Bengal has caused heavy incursion of moisture from the Bay of Bengal, he said. This is likely to keep the sky cloudy on Tuesday. There is also possibility of rain or a thundershower in some areas.

 The discomfort persists because of the high humidity level. At 11.30am on Monday, the comfort index was 61.6 degrees, 6.6 degrees above the permissible level. At 5.30pm, the index stood at 60.7 degrees, 5.7 degrees above threshold, stated the Met official.

 The maximum humidity during the day was 88 per cent, while the maximum temperature was 34.7 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal.

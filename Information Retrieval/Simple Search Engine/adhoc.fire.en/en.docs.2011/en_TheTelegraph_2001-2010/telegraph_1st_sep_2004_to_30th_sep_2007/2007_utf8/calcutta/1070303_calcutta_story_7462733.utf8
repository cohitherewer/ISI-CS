 Sight hope for eclipse

 A lunar eclipse in progress (Reuters)

 The sky is likely to clear up on Saturday, enabling Calcuttans to view the total lunar eclipse after midnight.

 The eclipse starts at 3 am. It will be most pronounced from 4.50 am to 5.27 am, after which partial eclipse will continue for a little over two-and-a-half hours. The end of the eclipse will not be visible from Calcutta, as the moon will set around 6 in the city.

 The weather will not shatter the hope of millions of people waiting for a glimpse of the celestial treat on Saturday night, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, director of the weather section of Regional Meteorological Centre.

 Moisture was coming in under the combined influence of a cyclonic circulation over Jharkhand and a low-pressure trough in the upper air, extending from Punjab to Gangetic Bengal. The trough has started moving and the sky is likely to clear up by tomorrow, added Debnath.

 Debiprosad Duari, director (research and academics), MP Birla Planetarium, hoped that even if the sky remains cloudy, Calcuttans will get to watch the partial eclipse, as it will continue for over two hours.

 The next lunar eclipse, on August 28, will also be total, though it will not be visible from Calcutta. The end of the partial phase will be visible from some northeastern states.

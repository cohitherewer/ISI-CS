 Vidhu Vinod Chopra on the sets of Eklavya with Amitabh Bachchan.

 It is a known fact that producer-director Vidhu Vinod Chopra is a stickler for perfection. Not only his directorial ventures Parinda, 1942 A Love Story, Mission Kashmir but also his productions Parineeta, Lage Raho Munnabhai are a testament to this. But his thing for details scaled new heights in his forthcoming Eklavya The Royal Guard.

 Utmost care was taken to get the right look for all characters in this magnum opus and none more so than the look for his protagonist, the title character, played by Amitabh Bachchan. 

 The look had to be contemporary and at the same time have a hint of the traditions of India, says Chopra. Thats what Eklavya is all about. Hence a lot of effort went into his bearded look and costumes to appear authentic in the film. Mr Bachchan was gracious enough to toil through the numerous beard and costume tests before we finally got the right look for him.

 Saif Ali Khan and Vidya Balan in the film

 Fashion designer Raghuvendra Rathore along with Vinod Chopra Filmss regular costume designer Subarna Rai Chaudhari created a blue print for the costumes. Raghuvendra hails from the royal clan of Jodhpur. His inputs and advice were sought to ensure authenticity. 

 When Bachchan was shown the sketch he was so excited that he immediately told his personal trainer that he must exercise harder to resemble the sketch as much as possible. With Vinod being the perfectionist that he is, he tried his level best to convince me to stop all other work to grow a real beard to get the authentic look, reveals Bachchan. Since that wasnt possible, we ended up having several sittings, beard trials to get the right hair colour... This was just the beginning. Then we went on to the turban, the dress which went on for months. I eventually realised Vinod has a penchant for perfection and I like that attitude. Its wonderful to be told after 35 years that I think you are wrong and this should be done in this manner and thats what Vinod did and I appreciate that. I hope the look is finally presentable and people will like it. 

 Besides Bachchan, Eklavya The Royal Guard, slated for a February 16 release, stars Sanjay Dutt, Saif Ali Khan, Vidya Balan, Jackie Shroff, Boman Irani, Jimmy Sheirgill, Raima Sen and Sharmila Tagore. Whew!

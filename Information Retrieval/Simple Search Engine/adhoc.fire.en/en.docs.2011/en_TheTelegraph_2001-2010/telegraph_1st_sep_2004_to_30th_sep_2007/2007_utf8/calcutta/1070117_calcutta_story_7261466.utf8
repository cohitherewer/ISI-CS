The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 For Rs 5 fee, lessons plus lunch

 - School offers free extra-curricular training

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Luxury buses to commute to and from school, healthy breakfast and lunch for students; lessons in karate, drama, elocution, painting, dancing, singing and debating after class; modern classrooms, games rooms, libraries and laboratories. 

 One institution is set to add its name to the list of elite English-medium schools that offer these facilities. But it will be a school with a difference, catering exclusively to children from poor families.

 The school is being set up at Santoshpur, on the southern fringes of the city, by the ICFAI group of educational institutions, in an attempt to make the best educational facilities accessible to the best brains from poor families. The first session begins in April.

 The schools tuition fee will be Rs 5 per month. Transport, food, extra-curricular training and other facilities will be offered free.

 The talents of the children living on the streets and in the slums are seldom discovered, said Santanu Ray, director of ICFAI Business School in the city. We are not focussing on merely imparting academic knowledge to the students of our new school. We want to offer holistic education for the all-round development of students. That is why the school will have all the modern facilities. 

 He explained the reason behind the nominal tuition fee: The students we intend to cater to hail from families that can make ends meet. If we dont charge the fee, there wont be anything at stake and the parents may not send the children to school.

 For the students, a day at school will begin with a breakfast of milk, bread and fruits. In the afternoon, a meal prepared in the fully-mechanised school kitchen will be served.

 The institution will be affiliated with the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and will follow the Madhyamik syllabus.

 The junior section, covering over 10,000 sq ft, is currently being constructed. Students from nursery to Class III will be admitted initially.

 According to Ray, annual expenditure for the school has been estimated at Rs 80 lakh. The organisation will not depend on donations to run the school, he signed off.

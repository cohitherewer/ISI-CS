 Files feared lost in fire

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A fire broke out in the municipal development project office on the third floor of the CMDA headquarters (Unnayan Bhavan) in Salt Lake on Thursday evening.

 Three tenders took more than an hour to douse the flames.

 Several files relating to development work in more than 40 municipalities are feared to have been lost in the blaze.

 A four-member committee, led by CMDA secretary Barun Roy, has been set up to find out the cause of the fire and the extent of damage.

 Besides, a 10-member committee has been set up to keep a watch on the building for the next 24 hours.

 We are still in the dark about the extent of loss. We will be able to make an estimate once the four-member committee submits its report. No possibility is being ruled out, but as of now, we dont think it to be a case of arson, said P.R. Baviskar, chief executive officer of the CMDA.

 A few employees of Unnayan Bhavan noticed thick smoke billowing from the third floor of the building around 5.10 pm.

 They rushed to the municipal development project office to save the files, but failed to enter, as the flames leapt out of the doors and windows. Within minutes, the fire spread to the wooden staircase.

 The maintenance staff turned up after some time and it was only then that we could open the fire extinguishers. By then, the fire had spread to a large part of the office, said an employee. Several items of wooden furniture stacked in one corner of the floor and papers strewn all around helped the fire to spread. Soon, police came to the spot.

 Over the past five years, the CMDA has spent around Rs 134 crore on development work in various municipal areas. With the files damaged, we fear several records on the expenditure have been lost. We want a judicial probe, said P.B. Nag, secretary, CMDA Suraksha Samity.

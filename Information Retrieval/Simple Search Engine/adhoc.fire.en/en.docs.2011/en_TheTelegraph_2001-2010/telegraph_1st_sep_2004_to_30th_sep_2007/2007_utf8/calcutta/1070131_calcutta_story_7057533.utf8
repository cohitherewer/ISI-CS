 Dismantle delay on marred site

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Greens dotted with patches of yellow, pierced with holes and covered with human excreta. That was the Maidan on Tuesday, a day after the high court ruled that Book Fair 2007 could not be held there.

 Only a handful of workers were seen dismantling the structures the court has ordered Publishers and Booksellers Guild to restore the Maidan to its original condition in seven days as most could not make it to the site because of Muharram and the oil tankers strike.

 It is not possible to keep the place green and dig in poles and erect stalls at the same time. When bamboo poles and plywood sheets are dumped, the grass gets crushed, pointed out a labourer.

 The ground has been dug as deep as 10/12 inches to lay electric cables from one end of the Maidan the area earmarked for the fair to the other. Lamp posts have been dug and control units erected.

 The banks of the tanks on the Maidan are strewn with excreta, as more than 5,000 hands working round-the-clock for the fair have been relieving themselves on the greens. Even makeshift kitchens have been set up for the workers.

 Understanding creativity

 Being an artist involves much more than simply making pictures. Artists are curious individuals who are driven by the desire to create and a willingness to take chances. They have a special way of seeing, feeling and thinking about the world that they share with us through their creations. Using their superior aesthetic imagination, artists use mediums and colours to express ideas that have the ability to move, inspire and attract viewers in a special way. The Masters of Imagination, the ongoing exhibition of paintings, travels the path towards attempting to understand the imagination of creative geniuses of the contemporary era. Participants include Kartick Pyne, Atin Basak, Tapas Sardar, Prokash Karmakar, Ramananda Bandopadhyay, Suhas Roy, Sanatan Dinda, Bratin Khan, Aditya Basak, Subrata Gangopadhyay (a painting by him appears right), Ashok Adhikary, Sibsaday, Subroto Das and Dewashish Das.

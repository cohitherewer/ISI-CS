 Music for the soul

 Indian classical music and Indian philosophy share a common ideology that helps bring forth our inherent qualities of compassion, forgiveness, generosity and humanity. In an age of extreme intolerance, hatred and violence, it is thus important to encourage and nourish the blossoming of these vital traits in the young generation, to ensure peace and harmony in tomorrows world. Playing its role in fulfilling this mission, the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture hosts a classical music soiree, that also promises to offer an evening of pure aesthetic pleasure. Featuring santoor maestro Pandit Tarun Bhattacharya, who will be accompanied by Abhijit Banerjee on the tabla.

 lEvent: Santoor recital by Pt Tarun Bhattacharya lWhen: Today at 6 pm lWhere: Vivekananda Hall, Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Gol Park

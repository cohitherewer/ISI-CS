 Doctor raid nets knives

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A fresh set of clues tumbled out of Jayanta Bags Andul home on Friday evening, as a criminal investigation department (CID) team led by additional director-general (CID) Bhupinder Singh and deputy inspector-general Neeraj Narayan Pandey raided the single-storeyed house. 

 Ten days after the mysterious death of Bag and his daughter, the CID officers recovered three blood-stained knives from the toilet and a sandal caked with blood in one of the rooms. The sleuths raiding the house after several rounds of search and seizure by Jagachha police station officers and forensic experts over the past week also noticed a blood-splattered wall in one of the rooms. 

 We are searching the house for further leads, said Bhupinder Singh, additional director- general (CID). 

 As the sleuths trained their sights on the Bag residence, Sutapa, wife of Jayanta, was released from the Howrah District hospital, where she was admitted on April 3 with cuts on her hands and throat. 

 Till now, the cops have officially maintained that Jayanta committed suicide after trying to kill his wife and daughter. But Sutapa has not spoken about the incident so far. On her release from the hospital, the 31-year-old woman was taken to her fathers house at Rudrapur, about 30 km from the hospital, in an ambulance, with a police escort jeep. 

 Our officers met her and tried to interrogate her today. But she did not reveal anything. We will definitely examine her further, said Pandey, adding that security had been posted at her fathers home.

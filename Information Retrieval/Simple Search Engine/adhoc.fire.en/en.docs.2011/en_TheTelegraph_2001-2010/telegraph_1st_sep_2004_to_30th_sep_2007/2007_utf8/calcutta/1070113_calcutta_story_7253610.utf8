 Melody and groove

 SUBHRO SAHA

 The Eric Truffaz 

 Quartet in performance; (below) one of his biggest 

 influences, Hariprasad Chaurasia 

 His parents wanted him to become an electrician. Instead, Eric Truffaz is today a celebrated cross-genre trumpeter on the cutting edge of contemporary jazz.

 For the French artiste, each concert is a chance to meet his public Face Face. And its this exchange between musicians and their audience the source of his inspiration that Truffaz has set out to recreate in venues across the world, from Mexico, St. Petersburg and Madrid to Lausanne, Paris, Mumbai and, now, Calcutta.

 The Erik Truffaz Quartet Malcom Braff (piano), Christophe Chambet (bass) and Marc Erbetta (drums) will kick off the Congo Square JazzFest 2007 with a concert on January 19 (at Dalhousie Institute, from 7 pm). The Truffaz tour, which starts with the city stop, is presented by the Alliances Franaises network in India (The French Association in Calcutta) and the French embassy.

 Ahead of the city concert, Truffaz gave an online interview to GoodLife. Excerpts:

 How 

 would you like to define the Erik Truffaz sound for our 

 readers? Is it Fourth-World music with a lot 

 of stress on bass drums? 

 My music is a mix of atmosphere, melodies and groove like Indian music, rhythms and spirit... 

 You once said that Indian music has influenced you. Has it enriched your body of work, and do you see scope for collaboration with Indian musicians in future?

 I love Indian music, specially the work of Hariprasad Chaurasia. We will collaborate in Calcutta with Indrani Mukherjee on vocals and Apurba Mukherjee on tabla. A few years ago, I met an Indian musician on the streets of Istanbul as I was drinking tea. I invited him to the concert and it was fantastic...

 This is your first concert tour to India. What are your expectations from the audience? Have you composed any special piece for the occasion or will you stick to your core live set with the Quartet?

 Its always incredible to discover a new country. India has a very rich tradition of arts and culture and Im sure the public will be fantastic. Im thinking at this moment about our collaboration with Indrani. I performed in June with Talvin Singh and Marque (Gilmore) in Montreux and Nantes and it was amazing Tabla and drums make the perfect fusion.

 How do you swing between two different bands Ladyland and the Quartet and why do you feel the need to do so?

 I did two bands in 16 years. Its not too many. We tour a lot around the world with one band after the release of a CD and sometime its necessary to stop if you want to recharge your batteries and create fresh music.

 How much of an influence has Miles Davis been, or Pierre Henry, for that matter, in shaping your music?

 I love Miles, I love Pierre Henry, I play with Pierre Henry. He is an eccentric genius. Miles is always looking over us, he did so much for jazz, one of the first to use tabla with drums... Yes, he is one of my biggest influences, especially for the groove.

 Is there any Indian musician you particularly admire and would like to collaborate with?

 I really love Chaurasia, he is one of my biggest influences alongside Miles

 Calcutta once had a very vibrant jazz scene, back in the 60s and 70s. Do you have any feedback about the city and its musical tradition or the recent trends?

 My friend, cineaste and musician Siegfried, told me a lot about Calcutta. He spent a lot of time in your city and he told me that Calcutta is the queen of Indian cities. So Im excited and looking forward to the concert.

 Hiring a taxi is set to get hassle-free, with stands coming up at prime locations.

 The Bengal Taxi Association (BTA), which plies 33,000-odd vehicles on the city roads, will set up over 20 taxi stands across Calcutta, including near hospitals and malls. 

 We have sought permission from deputy commissioner (traffic). If we get the nod, it will take us just two months to set up the stands, said Bimal Guha, BTA general secretary.

 Two such stands are already in place at Lake Gardens, near the Rabindra Sarobar lily pool, and on Sarat Bose Road, off Puddapukur. 

 Shakespeare Sarani, Gariahat, Jadavpur, Ultadanga, Moulali, Esplanade, Shyambazar, Maniktala, key crossings on VIP Road, Beleghata, the Park Circus Connector and Ballygunge are the other spots on the BTA radar.

 Its a good step taken. All metros should have taxi stands, and its a must in Calcutta, said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury. 

 The BTA has also written to mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya for permission. 

 I alone cannot take a decision on taxi stands. We will definitely take up the matter in the interests of the common people, said the mayor.

 The association plans to introduce a coupon system at the stands to ensure safety and security of passengers. 

 The coupon, with the taxi number printed on it, will have three parts one for the driver, the other for the passenger and the third to be retained by the association. Passengers taking a taxi will first have to collect the coupon from the respective stand.

 The coupon will help people get back to us in case they leave their belongings in a taxi or if they face a problem with the driver. We will be able to trace the car easily with the coupon. The coupons will also be of help in case of meter discrepancies, said Guha.

 Summons over loan recovery

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The Alipore court on Monday summonsed three officials of SBI Card and Payment Service Private Limited who allegedly violated a Supreme Court order by engaging musclemen to recover a loan.

 The three officials are Ajay Bhatri, Shantanu Bhattacharya and Suresh Chatterjee.

 The order followed a petition by Jayeeta Basu, a Jadavpur University student, who alleged that the three had made threatening calls to her father demanding credit card dues that had already been paid.

 The Supreme Court had recently ruled that the banks had no right to engage musclemen to recover loans.

 Several cases are being filed in criminal courts alleging violation of the apex court order, said Tamal Mukherjee, who appeared for Basu.

 My clients father, Manotosh Basu, has already made the payments which the bank is now demanding, Mukherjee told the judge.

 Complaints have been lodged with Tiljala police station against the accused on May 16 and 19 but no action has been taken, the lawyer alleged.

 The petition stated that two men, Abhijit Pal and Bikash Das, have been visiting the Basu home frequently posing as agents of the bank and threatening the family members to cough up the dues.

 On August 1, Pal and Das, accompanied by a few other men, tried to damage furniture in the house.

 They fled after Jayeeta shouted out at them, Mukherjee alleged.

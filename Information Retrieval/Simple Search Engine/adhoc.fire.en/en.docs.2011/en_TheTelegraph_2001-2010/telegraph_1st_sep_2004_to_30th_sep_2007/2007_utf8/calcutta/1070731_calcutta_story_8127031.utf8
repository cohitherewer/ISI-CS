 Teased on bus, student helps police arrest tormentor

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A Class VII student stood up to an eve-teaser on Monday afternoon and took up the matter with police to punish her tormentor.

 Tabassum (name changed) a student of Cartauche Public School in Park Circus was returning home in a bus on route 45. Unable to bear with the advances of a middle-aged man, standing behind her in the crowded bus, she raised an alarm.

 Though her co-passengers remained mute spectators, the bus driver stopped the bus seeing an on-duty sergeant.

 As the man in uniform approached the bus, Tabassums tormentor identified as Gautam Singh, a resident of Ripon Street panicked and tried to slip through the rear gate.

 But the sergeant caught Singh and took him to the girl in school uniform, who had by then come down from the bus along with some other passengers.

 She was looking very scared She told me that the man had been harassing her soon after the bus crossed the Park Circus seven-point crossing. When the man tried to argue with her, the little girl asked him to shut up, said Gautam Chatterjee, a sergeant of the south-east traffic guard.

 Some of Tabassums co-passengers, who were silent till then, supported her and Chatterjee handed over Singh to Gariahat police station. The Class VII student, a resident of Kamalagaji, in South 24-Parganas, also went to the thana.

 We have detained Singh on the basis of the girls statement. The girls parents were informed and they came to the police station and took away their daughter, said Dulal Chakraborty, the officer-in-charge of Gariahat thana.

 Tabassums act of courage comes around two weeks after Jagannath Dey a hotel management student was thrashed for raising his voice against some eve-teasers. But the girl, whom Jagannath tried to save, has not come forward to help cops nab her tormentors. 

 According to the police, lack of cooperation from the victims is one of the biggest constraints in booking eve-teasers.

 But this girl was brave enough. Though her parents took her away before she could file a complaint, the man could be detained only because she had come to the thana and recorded her statement, said an officer. 

 We are interrogating Singh and trying to find out his background, said an officer.

 The state disability commission, in association with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, will organise a sensitisation programme for the councillors on the Disability Act on March 8.

 The main objective of the programme, scheduled to be attended by the councillors of all 142 wards, is to spread awareness about the act at the grassroots, said an official. 

 It will elaborate on the provisions in the act and guide the councillors on how to help the specially-abled.

 We decided to organise the campaign after a few non-government organisations drew my attention to the lack of awareness about the Disability Act, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 Officials in the civic body and the disability commission said the specially-abled face a lot of problems while obtaining the certificate they are required to produce for availing of the benefits under the act. 

 The awareness programme will help redress the problem, said an official.

 Deputy disability commissioner K.S. Adhikari said: Not all councillors are conversant with the Disability Act. As a result, the specially-abled do not get much help when they visit the councillors with their problems.

 The awareness programme was also planned to lessen the load on the disability commission. People now come to us for any information about the act. If the councillors are made aware of the provisions, they would be able to take off some of our load, Adhikari pointed out.

 A survey held last year by a few NGOs revealed that there are around 2,379 specially-abled persons across the city. More than 90 per cent of them had no idea how to get a disability certificate.

 The programme should have been organised long ago, said a spokesperson for an NGO.

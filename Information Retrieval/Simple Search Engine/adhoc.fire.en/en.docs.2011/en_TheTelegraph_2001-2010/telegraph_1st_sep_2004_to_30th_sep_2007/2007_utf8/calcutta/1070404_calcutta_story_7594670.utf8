 Uniformity pitch for set-top boxes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is considering standardisation of set-top boxes (STBs) the tool necessary to watch pay channels in the conditional access system (CAS) regime to give consumers the freedom to switch from one cable operator to another. 

 With complaints of incompatibility of STBs reaching the watchdog, Trai is drawing up plans to iron out the problem to help consumers. 

 Incompatibility would force the consumer to return the STB he had bought from his first operator at a depreciated price and then buy a new one from his second operator if he shifts residence. But with the standardisation of STBs, consumers can shift from one locality to other without bothering about buying a new box, explained a Trai official. 

 According to the official, the central regulatory body has recently circulated a consultation paper among multi-system operators seeking feedback on a number of issues related to satellite television industry. 

 From issues related to improvement in quality of services to compatibility of STBs, Trai has sought comments from the MSOs. 

 It is clear that technical specifications for STBs has to be put in place, which all the operators will have to follow. We are trying to work towards that by collecting information provided by the operators, explained the official. 

 But cable television industry insiders argue that ensuring standardisation of STBs will be easier said than done, as it will mean loss of business opportunities for MSOs. 

 The sale of STBs has been a major source of income for MSOs. As there has not been any cap on the maximum retail price of STBs, these boxes are sold in excess of Rs 3,000, while they cost around Rs 1,700, explained the source.

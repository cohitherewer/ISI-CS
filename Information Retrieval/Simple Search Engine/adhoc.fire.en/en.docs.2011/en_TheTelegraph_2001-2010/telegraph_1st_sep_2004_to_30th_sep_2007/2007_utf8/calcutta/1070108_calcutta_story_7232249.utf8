 Lets not take stock

 TRADING TIPS: Rakesh Jhunjhunwala

 He is the undisputed king of the bourses. But ask mega investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala about his tips for the B-school boys and girls and the man who has raked in more than Rs 2,000 crores by trading in stocks tells the budding managers to steer clear of trading in stocks.

 Just like my father, who asked me not to smoke despite being a smoker, I am asking you not go in for stock trading, said Jhunjhunwala, who aims to win the war despite losing many a battle.

 He spoke at the closing chapter of Reverberations, the lecture series that is the flagship event of Intaglio 2007, the annual business school meet organised by the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta.

 Intaglio 2007 saw the best minds from Indian and foreign business schools flocking to the Joka campus to battle it out in a series of contests and events spanning all the functional areas of management.

 The top draw for Intaglio would be Reverberations, with speakers coming from diverse fields. Starting from the chief minister, who talked about reforms in West Bengal, to Sunil Alagh, who gave us an insight into what being a CEO means, it was very informative and motivating, said Sarfaraz Khimani, a second-year student of IIM Calcutta.

 Among the most popular events in Intaglio were Blue Print, that had the participants analyse the SEZ model of development, Consulting Knights, in which participants formulated strategies to acquire fictitious companies, and Wizards of Biz, an online business stimulation game. The quality of the events were extremely good, said a student from MICA.

 The other attractions were the cultural events, like the play put up by the dramatics cell of IIMC. This is the other side of Inatglio which is not just about business, said Sarfaraz.

 The B-school boys and girls were all ready to let their hair down after three days of intense competitions, with a rock show by Parikrama on Sunday evening.

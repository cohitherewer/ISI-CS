 Unrest over law college

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta Universitys law college campus, on Hazra Road, was rocked by an agitation on Thursday, as more than 500 students gheraoed the dean, the faculty secretary and a section of teachers.

 The protesters, supporters of the students wing of Forward Bloc, were demanding repeal of the universitys decision to reduce the number of Ll.B seats at Surendranath Law College from 240 to 120.

 The gherao started around noon. With the authorities refusing to pay heed to their demand, the students left the campus and blocked Hazra Road around 6.30pm. Traffic was disrupted in several areas.

 The blockade was lifted after police arrived around 7pm.

 Officials said the university had set up a committee to examine the infrastructure in the law colleges. The panel has found that the facilities and staff strength at Surendranath Law College could take the load of only 120 seats.

 The second day of the ramp presentation of Bridal Asia 2007 reiterated the opulent look of Day I. Oodles of bling with a metallic mesh, a riot of hues, traditional Indian craft forms and techniques on contemporary cuts

 On Thursday evening, the open-air extravaganza at The Grand in New Delhi witnessed trousseau lines by four design labels Suneet Verma, Bhairavi Jaikishan, Falguni and Shane Peacock and Pallavi Jaikishan.

 Master couturier Suneet Verma opened the show, with the showstealer being Rishi Kapoors daughter Riddhima Kapoor looking oh-so-pretty in a pink-and-beige shaded full-bodied lehnga.

 Bhairavi Jaikishan showed next, followed by the Mumbai-based Peacock duo showcasing bridal wear for the first time on the ramp. Pallavi Jaikishan wrapped up the evening.

 Sexy style

 Suneets look for the bride was soft, demure, girlie, sexy and sensuous. Distinctly different from all seven other collections showcased over the two evenings, his line stood out for the contemporary touch. Sans volume, the silhouettes were sleeker. Slim lehngas flared from the knee or draped skirts formed the lowers, while fitted corsets, cholis or strappy blouses formed the uppers. The saris were sensuous too, often in sheer fabrics.

 The stylish silhouettes boasted of traditional ornamentation aari and zardosi work combined with crystals, glass beads, sequins and satin ribbons. The palette comprised soft pinks, off-whites, nudes, pale greens, peaches and gold with splashes of hot pinks, bright blues and bridal reds. The bridal ensembles were complemented by co-ordinated sherwanis for the groom.

 Pastel pretty

 Bhairavi showed ahead of her mother Pallavi, and the highlight of her collection was the prominence of pastels pale pinks, powder pinks, nudes, roses, yellows, greens and more. I have kept in mind the summer wedding season because people are already shopping for that now. So, I have used lots of pastel colours. Also, many couples get married in exotic locations like Goa or Bali and the bride doesnt often want to stick to traditional Indian bridal colours, explains Bhairavi.

 The designer started off with a range of cocktail saris and ended with heavy bridal lehngas. Heavy sequin work, mostly in silver, combined with floral threadwork embellished the natural fabrics silks, georgettes, satins and dupion.

 The collection is for the confident bride of today. Theres a lot of mix-and-match so that the bride can create her won style statements, says she.

 Stone splash

 Falguni and Shanes collection boasted of all the signature elements the bling, the chunky stones, the animal prints Feminine tie-up cholis and corsets, full-skirt lehngas, empire-line kameezes teamed with skin-tight churidars made up the silhouettes. Then there were boleros, skirts and empire dresses for the trousseau.

 These ensembles were loaded with embellishments, along with a dash of their trademark animal prints. A highlight was the use of cloth roses in a 3D-effect. The colour story was vibrant and fabrics were luxurious.

 Though we have been doing bridals, this is the first time we showed it on the ramp. The collection is for bridals as well as cocktail parties and other wedding functions, says Shane.

 Silhouette talk

 The final sequence of the evening by Pallavi boasted of pretty much the same all-occasion trousseau essence as most other collections. The colours were rich Indian bright yellows, pinks, reds and blues and toned down occasionally with muted pinks and peaches. 

 This, too, started with cocktail silhouettes and ended with heavier bridal drapes. Saris, lehngas and kurtas were embellished generously with opulent Indian embroidery, mostly with floral motifs, and loads of crystals and gold. A highlight was the line of ghagra-saris, very easy to wear as it eliminates the fuss of pleating and tying a sari.

Education will play a pivotal role in the strengthening of two intellectual powerhouses Calcutta and Britain. 

 Kim Howells, visiting British minister of state at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, said this in Calcutta on Tuesday during the launch of a new British Council initiative The Lifestyle and Diversity Zone. 

 We need to make sure that intellectual connections between these two powerhouses get stronger. The next generation of jobs will involve brain power over brawn, said Howells, stressing the importance of knowledge in todays era. 

 From exchange of knowledge resources to sharing information on security issues, the British minister is in town with a packed agenda. 

 I will be meeting the chief minister this evening and we will discuss a wide range of issues, said Howells. 

 He made it clear that he was keen to pick the West Bengal governments brains about security issues, which is part of his brief as a minister of state at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. 

 If you look around India, it is part of a very volatile region. It is a tough neighbourhood to live in. We want to share as much information with the Indian government as possible with regards to security and terrorism, be it Naxalite or Islamic, said Howells. 

 Issues like climate change and potential of agriculture in the state will also figure in the discussion agenda.

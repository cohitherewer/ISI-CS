 Bar-owner held for fatal brawl

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The owner of a Howrah bar has been arrested in connection with Monday nights firing that killed two men and injured three, including a policeman. A brawl between two alleged gangsters in the bar had triggered the firing.

 Omprakash Agarwal, owner of Hotel Sish Mahal, on Andul Road, has been charged with harbouring criminals. A probe has revealed that criminals frequent the bar, said Niraj Kumar Singh, superintendent of Howrah police. The bar has been sealed.

 The other two men arrested in the case are Dilip Singh, who allegedly killed the two, and his associate Amit Singh.

 Police said a fight broke out in the bar between Dilip and Suren Singh over tipping dancers. Dilip chased Suren out and shot him dead.

 As a crowd gathered around the body, Dilip started firing indiscriminately, hitting a bystander, Prakash Singh, in the chest. Prakash died while being taken to hospital. Another man was injured.

 Sankrail police station was informed, and a van stationed nearby chased Dilip. An encounter ensued, in which assistant sub-inspector Samir Ghosh was injured. Ghosh, however, managed to shoot at Dilip before rounding him up.

 Inspector-general of police (law and order) Raj Kanojia said vigil on all the bars in the state would be stepped up.

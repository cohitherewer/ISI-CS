 Saptarsi Ghosh: In the past 

 few months, the stray dog count has doubled in areas like 

 Radhanath Mullick Road, Ramanath Majumdar Street and College 

 Street. Please take some steps to control the menace.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has stopped exterminating stray dogs. A few NGOs have been given the task of sterilising them. However, the CMC regularly picks up dogs from different wards.

 Earlier, the CSPCA used to handle the task. But following some complaints against their irregular service, the civic health department has assigned the job to some NGOs like Love-n-Care for Animals. 

 But the NGOs are facing problems, as local people often do not allow them to take the dogs away for sterilisation. By March-end, the civic health department will reintroduce licences for pet dogs and will also launch the state vaccination drive for stray dogs in all the wards.

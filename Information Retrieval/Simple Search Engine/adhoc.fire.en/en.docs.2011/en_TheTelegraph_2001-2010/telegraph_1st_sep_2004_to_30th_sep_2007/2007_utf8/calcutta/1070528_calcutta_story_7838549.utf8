 A mob damaged equipment and ransacked the emergency ward of National Medical College and Hospital on Sunday afternoon after the death of a local youth, allegedly because of negligence.

 The violence continued for over half an hour. Policemen from Beniapukur thana had to lathicharge the mob to disperse it. No one was arrested.

 Karaya resident Mohammad Rizwan, 22, was admitted to the hospital with high fever and breathing problems around 3pm on Sunday. The doctor who attended to Rizwan put an oxygen mask on him. Rizwan immediately started shivering because of his high temperature, said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (south).

 Rizwan died two hours later. His brother Abdul Farhad had reportedly asked the nurses to remove the oxygen mask but they refused.

 Rizwans condition started deteriorating after the mask was put on him. A doctor came and administered an injection just before he died around 5pm, recounted Farhad.

 After news of the death reached Rizwans locality, a group of 70 from the neighbourhood laid siege to the hospital. The men alleged that the youth was not treated properly.

 The mob smashed the windows in the emergency unit and damaged a computer. They also broke furniture in the ward, said an officer of Beniapukur police station. 

 There has been violence at four state-run hospitals in the city in the past two months over alleged negligence in treatment.

 In the past two weeks, parts of Medical College and Hospital and RG Kar Medical College and Hospital have been ransacked over similar allegations.

 Reliance in race for market

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four companies, including Reliance Retail, have been short-listed for redeveloping Park Circus market, owned by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). The other contenders are Salarpuria Properties, Bengal Shelter and the Ffort Group.

 Sources close to Reliance Retail said the company wants to use the space to set up its first hyper-market in the city. 

 There is no other way land can be acquired in Calcutta and buying two or three bighas will not help, said a company insider.

 Though the civic body may set a deadline of three years for the project, sources close to the Reliance group said the firm can ready it in two years.

 Monday was the last date for submission of tenders floated by the CMC. Financial bids will be opened on Wednesday. 

 According to the CMCs conditions, the private partner will have to provide temporary rehabilitation to the stall-owners before demolishing the market spread over 1.9 acres for reconstruction. 

 Around 10 per cent of the market area, about 15,000 square feet, will have to be allotted to the civic body.

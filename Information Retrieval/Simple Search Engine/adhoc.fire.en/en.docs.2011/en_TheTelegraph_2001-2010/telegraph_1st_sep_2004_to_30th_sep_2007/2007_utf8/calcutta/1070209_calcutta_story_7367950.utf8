 Cellphone nails teen

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A day after a school student was booked for drunken driving and causing injury to three pedestrians, another instance of teen crime was reported on Thursday.

 Officers of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) tracked down a Class X student of a north Calcutta school who had stolen the credit card of a classmate and bought a cellphone, clothes and other items worth Rs 25,000.

 Police, however, released the boy after interrogation, considering his age and future. We have asked the boys parents to come over to our Bhabani Bhavan headquarters in a day or two, said D.P. Tarenia, inspector-general of police (CID).

 Police said Vishal (name changed on request), son of a businessman from Dum Dum, had stolen his friends credit card a couple of months ago. He went on a shopping spree even before his friend could call the bank to block the card.

 He first purchased a cellphone from a Lindsay Street shop. The handset was quite expensive, Bluetooth-enabled and fitted with a camera, said an officer of the CIDs anti-cheating wing.

 The boy then visited shops in the Park Street-Shakespeare Sarani area to buy clothes. He purchased jeans, T-shirts and trousers, all of high-end brands, the officer added.

 Vishal did not show the phone to his parents he used to switch it off at home. As for the clothes, he said he had bought them by saving up his pocket money.

 Vishals friend was stunned on receiving the monthly statement of the card. His parents immediately got in touch with the local police station and then the CID.

 The sleuths first traced the outlet from where the cellphone was sold. From the shops record, we collected the IMEI number of the cellphone a security code unique to each handset and forwarded it to all companies doing business in the city, said the officer. 

 We told them to find out the SIM card number. The first feedback came in a couple of weeks, he added.

 After getting the number, police traced the address of the subscriber. Vishal took the connection by producing genuine papers about his identity. So, finding him out did not prove difficult, said the officer.

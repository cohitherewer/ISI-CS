 Dilip Kumar Mitra, 76, admitted to Eastern Railways BR Singh Hospital, Sealdah, suffered burns on his left hand and feet after he mistakenly used acid instead of water in the toilet on Sunday night. 

 Doctors say Mitra, a former railway employee, will have to get his fingers amputated.

 The hospital authorities ordered a probe into the incident after Mitras family lodged a complaint on Friday, alleging that negligence by hospital staff led to the accident.

 Mitra, a resident of Beckbagan, was admitted to hospital on September 18 with respiratory distress. There were no attendants to look after him. He had once fallen off the bed and no one came to his rescue, alleged Prasanta Ghosh, Mitras son-in-law. 

 Mitras family later hired an attendant to look after him. But the attendant was nowhere to be found when Mitra needed to go to the toilet on Sunday night. 

 He struggled out of the bed himself and went to the toilet, which was poorly lit. He noticed someone else in the toilet and asked him for some water, which the other person refused to give him, said Ghosh.

 Mitra found a bottle and poured the liquid inside on his left hand. The bottle, as was found later, contained acid, which caused severe burns on Mitras hand and feet.

 The acid was kept for cleaning the toilet and he used it by mistake, an Eastern Railway spokesperson said. 

 Mitras relatives were, however, not informed about the mishap. We saw the bandages but thought it was because of the drip. He was not in a state to talk, said a relative. 

 It was only on Friday that the doctors told us that the burns on his fingers were badly infected and there are chances of gangrene, Ghosh said. 

 The authorities are yet to find out whether the person Mitra saw in the toilet was the attendant or a hospital employee. The incident is being probed and we are trying to identify the person, an official said.

 The hospital authorities said the attendants are not railway employees. They stay on the premises illegally and are hired by the patients relatives, the official added.

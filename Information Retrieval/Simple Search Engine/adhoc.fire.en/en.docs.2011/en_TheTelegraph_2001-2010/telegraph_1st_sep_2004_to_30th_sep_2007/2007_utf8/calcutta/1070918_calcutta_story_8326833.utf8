 Contemporary concerns

 Young Contemporaries 2007 is an attempt to showcase not-so-famous artists who have all received institutional training in Bengal. The show attempts to map the shifting dynamics of art practices and to revisit the divergent tendencies post-1990s that dominate the works showcased here. Reji Arackal and Soumya Samanta reveal a certain cynical objective outlook, while Priyanka Lahiri and Sharmi Chowdhury hint at the idea of a borrowed life.The issues of existentialism and the anguish essential to urban life are addressed by Sumja Chakrabarty and Sekhar Karmakar. This is shared by others like Tapati Chowdury. Sanjay Patro, Sumitava Maity and Gautam Khamaru focus on aspects of the man-nature equation. While Ramu Das and Mahmud Husain experiment with eroticism, Sajal Kaity does the same with materiality. Sabir Alis art is the product of a multi-cultural experience. Still others, like Paramita Chakrabarty (one of her works appears here), seek reassurance in art. The works are done in varied media.

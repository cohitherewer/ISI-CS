The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fresh look at shelved project

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The East-West Metro project has been revived yet again, with the Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC) agreeing to conduct a final study on its viability and the proposed funding.

 We are seeking 70 per cent of the project cost of around Rs 4,000 crore as an equity loan from the JBIC, while the state and the Centre will contribute equally for the rest, said a transport department official.

 It was decided at a meeting between the state government and senior JBIC officials at Writers Buildings on Thursday that a three-month study would be undertaken by the Japanese agency to assess the states debt sustainability. 

 The Special Assistance for Project Formation study will begin in the first week of March and will be carried out by experts hired by the JBIC, as well as local consultants. The study will be funded entirely by the Japanese bank, which will submit the final report by June, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said on Thursday.

 Work on the project, which will link the citys flanks, has been stalled for the past three years, primarily because of the absence of a donor.

 Delhi Metro Railway Corporation (DMRC) had prepared a report and the project had even got environmental clearance from the state pollution control board. 

 But problems arose over funding, after the Railway Board refused to shoulder half the project cost, as demanded by the state government.

 Meanwhile, the length of the proposed rail route was curtailed from 23 km to 16 km, to bring down the project cost from Rs 5,400 crore to around Rs 4,000 crore. Instead of extending from Dasnagar (Howrah) to Rajarhat New Town, as planned originally, the revised route runs from the Howrah Maidan to Salt Lake.

 Once the JBIC study clears the project, the state will seek assistance from the Centre for funding half of the balance amount.

 Hes busy amp; lonely at 84

 Dev Anand at a city hotel on Saturday. Picture by Aranya Sen

 The scarf is very much there, wrapped around his neck a signature style statement for 62 years on screen. Dev Anand looks up with a tilt of the head and the huge warm smile of an evergreen hero. Though 84, he is as zestful as ever he loves to seize the moment and live it. The grand young man of Bollywood was in town on Saturday to launch his autobiography Romancing with Life, brought out by Penguin.

 Reshmi Sengupta caught up with him for a chat on life and love...

 How have Zeenat Aman and Tina Munim reacted to your book, which reveals quite a bit about them? 

 Everybody has been very nice. Theres nothing wrong in it (the book). How can I hurt anyone in my book when I have not hurt anyone in my life? I invited Zeenat to attend the book launch with me in America. She is very sporting. And Tina came with her husband Anil to the book launch in Mumbai.

 The book says a lot about the women in your life. How important were they to you?

 Every one of them was really important at some point. Everyone has added something to my life. Suraiya was my first calf love and I didnt want to deny that. Why be ashamed of yourself when you are loving someone?

 Did you meet her after the affair was over? 

 No, I never tried to meet her because I had to move on. I have always been moving forward. 

 Who among your contemporaries do you keep in touch with now?

 I call them, if I remember them. But I hang up when I have to go through their secretaries. I dont like that. I dont have a secretary; I am accessible to all. I am a busy man. And I am a loner. I dont need anyone. I like to be like that.

 Do young girls rushing to you for autographs still give you a high?

 Yes they do! You cant imagine how people react to me, wherever I go, in America or London! I have fallen in love with this attitude. It gives me life. And I want to be right in the front. I want to be the most known person. People must see that this man is doing something extraordinary. 

 What has been more important to you being a good actor or a popular star?

 Being a popular star is i-n-t-o-x-i-c-a-t-i-n-g. People talking about you, missing you, wanting to meet you! But you cant be a star without being a good actor. You have to prove yourself year after year after year.

 Which would be the one film you would pick among them all?

 Its very difficult for me to choose. Picking one would be a step-motherly treatment to the rest. I have been very choosy and I loved doing all my films. But Guide has been the high watermark in my career which culminated in The Jewel Thief. Also Hare Krishna Hare Rama and Des Pardes, two of the films I have directed. When I make a picture, it is the most important thing for me then.

 You only act in your own directorial ventures. Dont you get offers from others?

 Yes, and I got one yesterday. But I wont do anyone elses film because I am my own master. I gave up acting in others films after The Jewel Thief.

 And you still insist on doing only lead roles

 Tell me, whats a lead role? Its the central character. I dont act in any film if I am not the central character. I have never done so. So why should I break the tradition now?

 Do you watch todays films? Anything you liked recently?

 I have seen some in bits and pieces, not in totality. Well, I think they are making good movies. And I am also making good movies. I dont care what the world says. My films may be criticised but they are all good films. 

 Anything you feel that is yet to be done?

 Oh theres much to do! I think I havent achieved anything yet. I write, I direct, I have my studio, I have lots of calls to attend. Then there are so many people who want to meet me. Lets see what comes next.

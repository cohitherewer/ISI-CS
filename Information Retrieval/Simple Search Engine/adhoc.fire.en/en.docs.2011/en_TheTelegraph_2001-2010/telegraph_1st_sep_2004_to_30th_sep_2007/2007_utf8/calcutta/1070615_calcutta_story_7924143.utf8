 LPG-switch subsidy for autos

 - Rs 2 crore for project to check air pollution

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government has decided to grant city autorickshaws a subsidy on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) kits to encourage a switch of their fuel.

 Around Rs 2 crore is being earmarked for the project. Individually, this will work out to about Rs 4,000 per kit for the autorickshaws.

 The decision was worked out at a meeting on tackling pollution, at which transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and environment minister Sailen Sarkar, and their departmental secretaries, met officials from the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB).

 Were trying to reduce the kit prices. For this, well have to hold talks with the manufacturers. Another meeting will be held with the oil companies to ensure a regular supply of LPG, said an environment department official on Thursday.

 Taking into account the citys alarming auto emission, the state environment department had tabled the subsidy proposal before the transport department.

 According to a study conducted by the WBPCB, automobile pollution accounts for 52 per cent of the total air pollution in Calcutta, while auto-rickshaws contribute over 40 per cent to auto emission.

 There are about 40,000 autos plying in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area, of which only around 10,500 are registered. The government has always found it difficult to tackle these because of the patronage they enjoy from Citu, the ruling partys labour arm.

 It was also decided at Thursdays meeting that no unauthorised auto could seek legal papers or authorisation unless it converts to LPG, said the environment official. 

 In recent times, the state government has also decided to hire a remote-sensing auto-emission-testing machine mounted on a mobile van.

 This machine will be stationed at various intersections on different days, said environment secretary M.L. Meena. 

 This will measure the emission levels and also take a picture of the vehicle, along with its registration number, without stopping the vehicle. The trial run of the device has been successful, said Meena.

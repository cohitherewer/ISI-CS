 As MNCs and IT majors turn their gaze on Calcutta and with over 20 million sq ft of hi-tech office space being readied for fitouts in the next 36 months, its time for Haworth, a global leader in ergonomically-designed workplace solutions, to partner the growth.

 The company, headquartered in Holland, Michigan, with net sales of $1.4 billion in 2005, inaugurated its Calcutta office-cum-showroom themed Great Spaces in Sector V on Wednesday. The Salt Lake hub is expected to serve the growing needs for adaptable and sustainable workplaces in Calcutta, the rest of eastern India and Bangladesh.

 With people spending more time in office, its essential to create a home feel at the workplace. A more conducive ambience for physical comfort and peace of mind leads to better productivity, Frank Rexach, Haworths vice-president amp; general manager, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America, in town for the launch, told Metro.

 The US group driving design and manufacture of adaptable workspaces, including raised floors, systems furniture, seating and storage solutions, is keen to support Calcutta companies in creating world-class office spaces, according to Kapil Agarwal, managing director, India.

 I have been tracking Calcuttas remarkable growth curve and Im confident this is the future destination for IT, biotechnology and other new service sectors. We at Haworth believe people are your most important asset and our solutions are designed to make the workplace a potent business tool, Agarwal stressed.

 The city outlet will demonstrate trends of future workplaces and provide a venue for clients, designers and guests to exchange ideas. Employers have just thrown in a bunch of cubicles as office space. We want to first give the CEOs a vision plan and then engage architects, designers and developers to create built-to-suit offices together, Rexach explained.

 India is Haworths second base in the Asia Pacific after Shanghai for the Ideation Group, an in-house research wing that partners with Haworths clients, architects and designers to better understand how to create the optimum work environment.

 The Ideation team, comprising architects, ergonomics experts, cognitive psychologists and anthropologists, look into factors that serve to attract and retain the best talent in India. The team will carry out research on the Calcutta scenario, said Rexach.

 Haworth started business operations in India in 1997, and is present in seven cities now.

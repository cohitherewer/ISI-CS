The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Outcry over shop noise

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Local residents and a school in Howrah have come out against Egaro, a departmental store set up by Khadims. The store is causing noise pollution, alleged the school and the citizens. 

 The store, reportedly without a CESC connection, runs two massive 320KV generator sets and an air-conditioner that emit noise and fumes throughout the day, alleged local residents.

 Its almost impossible to conduct classes. The heavy noise and the constant vibration of the generators are affecting our students health, rued the teacher-in-charge, Howrah Akshaya Shiskhayatan, a 120-year-old school located beside the departmental store, which opened its doors on June 1. The teacher has requested the district magistrate of Howrah to intervene for immediate redress.

 The constant noise is unnerving and unbearable. The disturbance starts at 9am and continues till 10pm, complained Dulal Das, a resident of the area who recently underwent a cardiac operation.

 We have not given anyone permission to run generators in the store. I will soon look into the matter and take appropriate action, Khalil Ahmed, district magistrate of Howrah, told Metro.

 One needs permission from the pollution control board to run a generator set beyond 15KV and in this case, no permission has been given, said Somenath Narayan, in-charge, state pollution control board, Howrah.

 Some people have complained about noise pollution, admitted Egaros administrator Partha Malakar. However, he maintained that the onus of obtaining permission lies with the builder. We will take care of it, said Mantu Jaiswal, the builder. 

 Prompt action will be taken if the store has violated environment norms, stated M.L. Meena, state environment secretary.

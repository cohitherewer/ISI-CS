 Salt Lake park sleaze

 - Township complaints lead to raid on Banabitan, 50 held

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The veil was ripped off Salt Lakes sleazy garden of Eden on Thursday in a police raid that netted 50 offenders.

 Among those arrested at Banabitan for indulging in obscene acts in a public place were 25 girls, aged between 17 and 22, two of them still in school.

 A team of senior police officers and the sub-divisional officer of Bidhannagar raided the most verdant part of Central Park on Thursday afternoon, following repeated requests from residents.

 We had received several complaints from residents of Salt Lake about the public nuisance at Banabitan. As the garden is visited by families and children, such public display of vulgarity cannot be tolerated, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 All the youths caught in the act in Banabitan were booked under the bailable sections 290 and 294, pertaining to indulging in obscenity and creating nuisance in a public place.

 They were all found in compromising positions during the raid. We were shocked to find many girls from good families, said an officer who was part of the raid team.

 Officials said apart from the complaints from residents, the police had been tipped off about a gang of youths luring girls to Banabitan, indulging in sexual activity and then blackmailing them. 

 One of the youths arrested on Thursday had lured a schoolgirl to the park. He runs a paan shop, said an officer.

 Banabitan, open from 8am to 6pm, has long been a happy hunting ground for lovers. Visitors come in from as far as Barasat and Babughat. 

 Guards have been known to chuck stones into dense shrubs to prevent couples from getting too cosy.

 Of late, Banabitan has changed from a love nest to a sleaze spot. We have stopped going for evening walks as a sex racket seems to be flourishing there, with the tacit support of the police, alleged Sourav Biswas, 60, a resident of Karunamoyee.

 The crackdown has been welcomed by residents and officials alike. This is directly linked to the rising rate of crime against women in the township. The police must take stern action to curb this menace, said Dilip Gupta, the former chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality.

 Narayan Basu, president of the Bidhannagar Welfare Association, added: We would urge the police to continue such action.

 According to senior officials, Nicco Park and Nalban would be targeted next in the clean-up drive.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Move against trafficking 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Six government departments will form a network to fight the menace of human trafficking. The social welfare department will act the nodal agency.

 The health, backward classes welfare, self-help group and self-employment, panchayat and rural development departments will form the network. Police, CID, NGOs and the state womens commission will play a key role in the initiative.

 The primary objective of the network, the first of its kind in the country, is to spread awareness among the people both in the city and the rural areas so that they do not fall prey to this menace. The network comes with the assurance of economic independence and proper rehabilitation of victims.

 We have been waiting for this kind of a programme in which all the departments will join hands to fight the menace, said social welfare minister Biswanath Choudhury.

 The state government has allotted Rs 1 crore for this purpose. The network will meet after every two months to review progress and the latest situation. 

 The decision to form the network was finalised following a report on human trafficking prepared jointly by three universities. The social welfare department had asked Calcutta, North Bengal and Burdwan universities to prepare the report.

 The network was formed following the alarming revelation that human trafficking is on the rise in West Bengal.

 Poverty forces people to become part of the racket. So we will have to ensure that these people have a source of income, said the CPM legislator from Haripal and former member of state womens commission, Bharati Mutsuddhi.

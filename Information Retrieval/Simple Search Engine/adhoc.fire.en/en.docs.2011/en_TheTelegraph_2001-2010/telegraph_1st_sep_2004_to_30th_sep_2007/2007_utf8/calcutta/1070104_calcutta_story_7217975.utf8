 You share your birthday with...

 Michael Stipes, singer

 Youre a dedicated worker; once committed to a project, you never stray from it. You dont waste time; you believe time is money. You have the insight to grasp what motivates people. You are an independent worker and function best when left alone. You have great ideas; you must capture every opportunity to put them to good use. Kusum Bhandari

 Burglars cleaned out jewellery 

 and cash worth about Rs 3 lakh from two houses in Behala 

 and Thakurpukur on Saturday night.

 Ornaments fetched from a bank locker for a wedding were among the items stolen from a single-storey house on Fakir Para Road, in Behala. The loot was valued at Rs 2 lakh. A middle-aged couple live in the house. 

 The Thakurpukur house was burgled while the occupants were away on a trip. 

 At Behala, the burglars broke a window pane and cut through the grille to enter a room in which the husband and wife, in their mid-50s, were sleeping. They found out the key to the almirah in the room and left with the valuables.

 I stay with my wife Rikta, while our engineer son lives in the US. We were sleeping with the bedroom door open, as we generally do. We woke up in the morning and found the almirah open and jewellery, worth more than Rs 1.5 lakh, and Rs 40,000 in cash missing from the locker, said S.K. Dutta, the owner of the house.

 Additional superintendent (industrial) South 24-Parganas D.P. Singh stated: The almirah is only a few feet from the bed. But the thieves managed not to wake up the couple.

 Dutta, a retired officer of Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited, said he had brought the jewellery home for a wedding in the family. We have a small box in which we keep all the keys. The thieves picked up the right key from the box. They left the empty jewellery boxes on the dining table. They did not touch the ornaments made of other metals.

 Police suspect that the burglars knew that the jewellery would be kept in the house. We are questioning the help. She started working for the couple only a couple of months back, said an officer of Behala police station.

 In the other incident, burglars struck at Prabir Sikdars house while he and his family members were in Tarapith. 

 They had left at dawn on Saturday. The family came back at night to see the television, DVD player, jewellery worth about Rs 50,000 and about Rs 25,000 in cash missing, said an officer of Thakurpukur police station.

 A week ago, valuables worth nearly Rs 1 lakh was burgled from Swapan Dass house, in the same locality.

 Singh said police are trying to determine if a gang is at work. We have alerted police stations in the area and have got in touch with Calcutta Police. The night vigil is being intensified, he added.

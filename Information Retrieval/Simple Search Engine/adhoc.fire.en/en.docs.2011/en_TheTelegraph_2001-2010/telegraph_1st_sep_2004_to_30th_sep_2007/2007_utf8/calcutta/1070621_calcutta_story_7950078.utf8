 Education roadmap

 - Conference plans blueprint

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A five-year roadmap will be drawn up for the betterment of higher education in West Bengal at the completion of a two-day conference, organised jointly by the Indian Chamber of Commerce and the state higher education department. 

 The conference began on Wednesday, with the participants trying to pinpoint the problems that plague higher education.

 Under-utilisation of seats at undergraduate colleges, lack of decision-making freedom due to too many regulations, absence of quality teachers and students and lack of funds are some of the problems of colleges in Bengal, felt the participants.

 As many of the selected candidates fail to enrol, 30 per cent of the seats reserved for various categories in colleges are not properly utilised. This is another problem, said Monimala Das, principal, Bethune College. 

 Most of these seats remain unutilised, as allowing these for general category students, remains a lengthy process, she said.

 One of the major points that came up in the course of discussion was the increasing necessity of public players in the field of higher education.

 The paucity of funds is one of the basic problems. This is one of the primary reasons for which we have invited private participation, said Sudarshan Roy Chowdhury, state higher education minister.

 Higher education is facing a two-pronged challenge, said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academics), Calcutta University.

 Weve to expand the social base of education and also provide equity of access to education, especially in a social system which is gender biased. This is where private participation comes into play, said Das.

 Education has become important to West Bengals economic growth. A lot of ground can be covered if industry-institute partnership can be established, said S. K. Bangur, president, Indian Chamber of Commerce.We would like to take an active role in the processes that will contribute to the betterment of higher education in Bengal.

 The problems and suggestions will be incorporated into a blueprint for the future.

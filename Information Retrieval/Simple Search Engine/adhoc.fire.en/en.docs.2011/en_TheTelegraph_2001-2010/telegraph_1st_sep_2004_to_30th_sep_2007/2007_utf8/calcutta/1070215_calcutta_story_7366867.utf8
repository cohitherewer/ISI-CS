The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Abstraction with bright tones

 - Artworks by Ganesh Haloi, Prabhakar Kolte and others

 SOUMITRA DAS

 A work on display at Gandhara art gallery

 Abstract seems to be the flavour of the season. This is the second exhibition which opened in January where mostly works that fall in this category are being highlighted. The artists at Gandhara art gallery, whose works fall in this category are the late Badhan Das, Ganesh Haloi, Prabhakar Kolte and John Tun Sein from Chennai. Jayashree Chakravarty is the only participant in whose works the drawings of buildings, however small, cannot be missed.

 John Tun Sein is new to this city. In both his largish works one horizontal, the other vertical he uses strong shades of red, yellow, black and green, building up triangles and other geometric shapes, smudging their outlines to delete clear-cut demarcations, and thereby creating an impression of vibrancy. 

 Halois large architectural drawing reminds us of the palaces and forts of Rajasthan, with arches above entrances and portals and the rigid geometry of their structures. He uses a matt pink, Indian red and ochre which accentuates the austerity of his painting. However, another painting, where he conjures up the bright green paddy fields of Bengal without really depicting any vegetation save the impressions of banana plants, is a more successful work. You can almost visualise the sap animating life and nature. He has his say without wasting any words.

 Koltes works, as usual, have no reference to real life. Colours are the pith and marrow of his works, which he uses in the same way that a composer uses harmonies, rhythm and melodies. Reds, blues and greys are carefully orchestrated to construct works which are often the visual equivalents of concertos, where a limited number of instruments are in dialogue with each other. Here, Kolte is noticeably successful in the smaller works, in which, even when the paint seems to dribble, it dribbles just so much, and not more.

 The sole Badhan Das on display is quite unlike the works we are familiar with. It is a small work and reminds one of a huge boulder riven into two a deep black mark running through the moss green surface.

 Jayashree Chakravartys paintings afford a passage into the workings of her mind. She works up swathes of mist through which one discern a flurry of fine brushstrokes, like the surface of a sea being churned by a gale. Yet, the general impression is of great serenity. 

 Sometimes, the shapes of dwelling houses appear in the land of mists motifs used on a much larger scale in her canvases. As a painter, her style has matured over the years, and is now the right vehicle for expressing her fine sensibility.

 Oil strike off on promise of higher interim pay 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: Officers of public sector oil companies called off their agitation within hours of going on an indefinite strike after the government agreed on a higher interim relief to compensate for the delay in revising their wages.

 The strike has been called off as the petroleum ministry has agreed to give an interim relief of Rs 60,000 to Rs 1,20,000 per employee for the period after January 1, 2007 when wage revisions were due, said Sanjay Goel, president of the officers union at ONGC.

 Goel, however, refused to disclose any further details on the negotiations with the ministry. Officials said talks would continue on the quantum of increase in the salaries. 

 The strike had slowed down operations at 17 of the 19 refineries, leading to a shortage of gasoline and jet fuel. 

 About 45,000 employees of the Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and other state-run companies, who are part of the Oil Sector Officers Association (OSOA), had called for a strike to press for the merger of 50 per cent dearness allowance with basic pay.

 The officers also demanded release of ad-hoc payment and withdrawal of tax on perquisites such as company-provided accommodation.

 The OSOA has demanded increased compensation to deter employees from leaving for private companies that have been allowed to enter the domestic oil business as part of an economic reform program, said R.P. Srivastava, convener of the OSOA. 

 The OSOA had earlier planned to go on a strike in September last year but called it off after assurances by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 The oil companies had yesterday said they were ready with contingency plans to counter the strike call. 

 Last evening, oil minister Murli Deora had offered Rs 50,000-1,00,000 interim payment, which was rejected by the OSOA. The petroleum ministry had declared the strike illegal as various high courts had asked the officers to refrain from such an action. Besides contempt of court, the officers may face severe disciplinary action. 

 The strike call was the culmination of a series of measures initiated by the OSOA over the last one year. It had organised gate meetings from August 6 and black badge protests while at work from August 13.

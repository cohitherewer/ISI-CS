 Coal India, DVC plan deal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 4: Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) is planning a joint venture company with Coal India Ltd (CIL) for captive coal mines in India and abroad.

 The joint venture will develop underground mines in the country and acquire mines overseas. DVC, which produces over 2,200 mega watt (mw) of thermal power in Bengal and Jharkhand, will use the coal.

 DVC chairman Asim K Barman said the joint venture would enable DVC to become self-sufficient in coal. DVC is likely to have a higher stake in the JVC. DVC, which gets coal from CIL, has fixed a target to generate 10,000mw by the 11th Five Year Plan. It would need 50 million tonnes (mt) of coal to generate the 10,000mw as 1,000mw requires 5 mt of coal.

 DVCs plan is similar to the strategy of the countrys largest thermal power producer National Thermal Power Corporations (NTPC) agenda to buy mines abroad. NTPC may also tie up with CIL in this regard.

 The power ministry has also proposed to set up plants on the coast using imported coal. 

 Barman said no overseas mines have been identified so far. Indian power and steel companies have been scouting for coal blocks in Australia, South Africa, Indonesia but without much success.

 Tourism plan

 DVC is setting up a company with ILFS to promote tourism within the valley region. Locations around Maithon, Tilia where huge water reservoirs have come up due to dam would be taken up.

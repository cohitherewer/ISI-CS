 Temasek to invest in core sectors

 Singapore, Feb. 12 (Bloomberg): Temasek Holdings, the Singapore governments investment arm, said it will invest in more infrastructure projects in Asia as governments urge private companies to help finance such plans.

 Temasek, which has $84 billion in assets, is interested in infrastructure opportunities in countries including India, China, Indonesia and Thailand. It will use Cityspring Infrastructure Trust as its main vehicle for such investments.

 Temasek is pioneering these infrastructure trust products, the financial institutions chief executive officer Ho Ching said.

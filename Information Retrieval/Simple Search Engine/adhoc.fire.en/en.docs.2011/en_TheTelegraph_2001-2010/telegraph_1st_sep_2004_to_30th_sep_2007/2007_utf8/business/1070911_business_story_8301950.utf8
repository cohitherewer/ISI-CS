 Incomes to grow three times in next two decades

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, Sept. 10: Incomes in India are projected to leap almost three-fold over the next two decades and the country will emerge as the fifth largest consumer market in the world by 2025. At present, it is 12th in the world.

 A report released by McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), the consultancy firms economics research arm, said if Indias high economic growth rate held steady, more than 291 million people would move up the ladder, from poverty to a more sustainable life, and Indias middle class would swell by over 10 times from its current size of 50 million to 583 million people by 2025. 

 By this time, over 23 million Indiansmore than the population of Australia todaywill number among the countrys wealthiest citizens.

 The forecasts were made in a report titled, The Bird of Gold: The Rise of Indias Consumer Market. 

 While the sharp growth in incomes will obviously mean that spending power will also jump, MGI made some significant observations about spending pattern. 

 It says Indians will spend more money on categories such as communications and healthcare and the relative importance of basic necessities such as food and apparel will decline.

 The report said that in order to achieve these positive results, India must continue to reform and modernise its economy as well as address significant shortfalls in its infrastructure and education system.

 McKinsey based its forecasts on the assumption that the real compounded annual growth of Indias GDP will be to the tune of 7.3 per cent from 2005-2025, an acceleration from the 6 per cent growth in the previous two decades. If such growth rates do indeed come about over the next 20 years, Indian income levels will almost triple. Average real household disposable income will grow from Rs 113,744 in 2005 to Rs 318,896 by 2025.

 There is more good news. The study said Indias rising real incomes already had a significant impact on poverty reduction. 

 In 1985, almost 93 per cent of the population had an annual household income of less than Rs 90,000, thus falling in the deprived category. By 2005, this had dropped to 54 per cent of the population.

 So, in effect, there are 31 million fewer poor people in India today than there would have been if poverty had remained at its 1985 rate. In short, Indias economic reforms, and the increased growth that has resulted, have been the most successful anti-poverty programme in the countrys history, it added.

 The forecast said the deprived segment will drop from 54 per cent of the population in 2005 to 22 per cent by 2025. Overall 291 million people will move out of poverty during a period when 322 million people will be added to the countrys population. Effectively, this means that India will have 5 million fewer poor by 2025.

 The emergence of a huge middle class is not a question of if but when for India, said Adil Zainulbhai, managing director India, McKinsey.

 Aggregate consumption in India will grow in real terms from Rs 17 trillion today to Rs 34 trillion by 2015 and 70 trillion by 2025 a four-fold increase. This will vault India into the premier league among the worlds consumer markets. 

 By 2015, it will be almost as large as Italys market. By 2025, Indias market will be the fifth largest in the world. 

 Average real rural income growth per household will accelerate to 3.6 per cent over the next two decades and consumption will reach todays average urban household level by 2017. However, by 2025, the Indian consumer market will largely be an urban affair, with 62 per cent of consumption in urban areas versus 38 per cent in rural areas.

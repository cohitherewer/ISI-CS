 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: Ten companies, including private equity firm Blackstone, Barclays, WL Ross, JC Flowers, Goldman Sachs, Punjab National Bank (PNB), the IDBI and the IDFC, have reportedly placed expressions of interest (EoIs) to buy a 26 per cent stake in the Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI). 

 According to qualification parameters for making bids, a potential suitor needs to have an asset book of Rs 10,000 crore or a net worth of more than Rs 4,000 crore or a fund with average assets of more than Rs 10,000 crore. 

 In case of a consortium, investors need to have a lead investor and hold at least 26 per cent stake. The total number of members in a consortium should not be more than four.

 The Delhi-based financial institution invited EoIs from domestic and foreign investors to buy a 26 per cent stake last month.

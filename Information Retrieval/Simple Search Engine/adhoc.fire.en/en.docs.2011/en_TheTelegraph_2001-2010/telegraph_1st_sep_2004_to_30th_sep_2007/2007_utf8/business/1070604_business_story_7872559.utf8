 GDP numbers under scanner

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 THE TRUE PICTURE

 New Delhi, June 3: Over the last few weeks, the government has come out with growth figures for the economy that have once again stoked a strong feel-good factor and, perhaps, a dose of nationalistic fervour. 

 The latest in the series is the quick estimate of the gross domestic product (GDP) for 2006-07 which has now been pegged at 9.4 per cent, the highest in nearly two decades.

 But a few doubting Thomases feel that the figures may be slightly bloated. Other critics say the growth isnt touching the majority of Indians lives, leading to a simmering discontent which sometimes boils over.

 S.P. Gupta, former member of the Planning Commission, says, We use the gross output method to calculate our quick estimates of national income, while we use the far more accurate value-added method to calculate the final estimates. This is what makes a huge difference. 

 Gupta and many other economists feel that in the gross output method used for quick estimates, the value of imports is also being counted as value added locally. 

 We are importing more now. When these figures are lumped into our gross estimates, the over-calculation is that much more, says Gupta. 

 In 2003-04, India imported goods worth $78.15 billion. In the first 11 months of 2006-07, India imported goods worth $164.98 billion, which means imports doubled in just three years in value terms.

 The other problem, economists argue, is that the growth reflects manufacturing and service sector trends. The GDP is being presented as an iconic figure and the fact that two-thirds of our people living directly or indirectly off farming are left untouched by it is being glossed over, says Kamal Nayan Kabra of the government-run Indian Institute of Public Administration.

 Estimates show that manufacturing and services powered last years growth surge while farming lagged behind.

 Manufacturing, which accounts for 15 per cent of the GDP, grew at 12.4 per cent and services, which accounts for nearly 60 per cent of the economy, grew at 9.9 per cent. 

 However, farming and allied activities, which engage more than 60 per cent of the countrys population, grew at just 2.7 per cent. 

 Worse, the GDP growth is without employment generation, says Kabra. India is creating new jobs but the rate at which it is creating them is far short of the number of working age people it is throwing up. An inefficient farming business is sheltering far too many people, while manufacturing is unable to create the jobs, which could absorb the excess labour from farms.

 This obviously creates its own set of problems of equity. With money flow restricted to urban-based services and manufacturing sectors, Indias hinterland is a seething nation of discontent. The Gujjar agitation over caste-based reservations is really a manifestation of the rural anger. In one sense, it is a strong protest against the way that urban India with its service sector riches is going forward, leaving villages just a few kilometres away in terms of distance far behind, says Gupta.

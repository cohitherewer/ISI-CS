 Crude import bill jumps to $48bn

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, May 7: The countrys crude import bill has shot up 24 per cent to $48.1 billion for the year ended March 31. Prospects for the current fiscal also look bleak with the average cost of crude imports rising by $3 a barrel.

 The average price of the Indian basket of crude imports works out to $65.38 a barrel for the current fiscal compared with $62.46 a barrel for the previous year.

 Indias basket comprises 55 per cent of the cheaper Gulf variety and 45 per cent of the more expensive sweet Brent crude. The cheaper varieties contain more sulphur than the sweet crude and are also more difficult to process.

 To moderate costs, domestic oil companies import the varieties with high sulphur content and mix them with the sweet variety before refining.

 Crude prices have soared because of tension over the nuclear stand-off with Iran and a civil strife in Nigeria, the worlds eighth-largest producer. Speculators are also believed to have played a major role in the price rise.

 Domestic firms import fairly large quantities of the Bonny light sweet variety from Nigeria and any increase in its price impacts the Indian basket.

 Nigerian supply concerns had eased last week after Royal Dutch Shell said its Forcados oil export terminal might resume operations in June, more than a year after it was shut down because of militant attacks. However, more violence and a spate of kidnappings in the African nation have cast some doubts over whether this deadline could be achieved.

 India imported 110.85 million tonnes of crude in 2006-07, which is 11.5 per cent higher than the 99.4 million tonnes purchased in 2005-06.

 In rupee terms, the imports work out to Rs 219,990.9 crore in 2006-07 against Rs 171,702 crore in the previous year.

 The import of petroleum products, mainly LPG, went up by 45.2 per cent to $8.89 billion in 2006-07 from $5.86 billion in the previous year.

 Total import of crude and petroleum products in 2006-07 were valued at $56.99 billion, up from $44.64 billion last year.

 With the expansion of the refining capacity in the country, exports of petroleum products went up to $17.64 billion from $10.54 billion in the previous year.

 Officials said Indias fuel demand grew 5.9 per cent to 119.84 million tonnes in 2006-07.

 The exports of petroleum products during the year include diesel, naphtha, petrol and aviation turbine fuel.

 As a result of the higher exports, the net oil import bill worked out at $39.34 billion in 2006-07 compared with $34.09 billion in the previous year.

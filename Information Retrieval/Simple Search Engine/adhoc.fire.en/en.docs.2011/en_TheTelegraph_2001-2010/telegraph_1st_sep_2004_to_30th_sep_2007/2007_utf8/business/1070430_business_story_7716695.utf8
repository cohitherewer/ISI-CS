 Q amp;A

 Indian rules

 I have an NRO account with a bank in India and I found that they are deducting tax 30.6 per cent on the interest. Is this correct? I dont have income above Rs 1 lakh in India. 

 S. D. Pal, Dhanbad

 The bank is right. Section 195 of the Income Tax Act makes it mandatory for the bank to deduct tax at source irrespective of the actual level of your Indian income. However, if you find that the tax deducted is more than your final tax liability, you may file a tax return and ask a refund of the excess deduction. You cannot claim non-deduction of tax by submitting forms, 15-G or 15-H.

 NSS withdrawal

 I have a deposit in National Saving Scheme. I want to withdraw the money and close the account. The post office has said it would deduct tax at the rate of 20 per cent on the withdrawn amount. Is NSS withdrawal taxable? Do I have to pay more tax on the balance that I would get?

 S.K. Sinha, Calcutta

 assessee has to file return every year declaring his total income and the tax payable. You can furnish the TDS certificate with the return and the tax liability would reduce accordingly. If additional tax has been paid, it would be refunded to you by the tax authority. 

 Property proceeds

 I am a retired person and have two sons and a daughter. My father purchased a plot and constructed a house. In his will, my father bequeathed this property to me. I want to sell the property and divide the proceeds equally among the four of us. Will each of us have to pay tax?

 R.S. Prasad, Howrah

 As your father has left a will bequeathing the property solely to you, you will be its sole owner. The mere fact that you plan to divide the property sale proceeds among your children will not result in tax liability in their hands. You own the property and, therefore, the capital gains tax will arise entirely in your hands.

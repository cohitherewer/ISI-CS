 Calcutta, Sept. 8: The nuclear deal with the US can go a long way in ensuring energy security for India, said Ashwani Kumar, minister of state for commerce and industry. 

 The nation needs to support the India-US nuclear deal. It will ensure energy security for India and will put the country on the right side of power, Kumar said at the valedictory session of the 34th national management convention being organised in the city by the All India Management Association (AIMA) and the Asian Association of Management Organisation (AAMO). 

 The three-day convention, which focussed on the challenges faced by the managers of new India, emphasised the need for increased, continued and sustained growth. The role of management in new India should be to ensure that the growth is inclusive, said AAMO president J.J. Irani.

 Farooq Hassan, executive director of the Management Association of Pakistan, also stressed on inclusive growth. We want rich people in our countries but not only rich people. Inclusive growth is necessary in countries such as Pakistan and India, where 25 per cent of the population is under the poverty line, said Hassan.

 B. Muthuraman, managing director of Tata Steel and co-chairman of the convention, said, While management education in India is about giving inputs of knowledge, 80 per cent of it is about the desire to achieve, about creative independence and thinking out of the box. Management institutes in India should concentrate on inculcating these aspects among its students.

 Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of the RPG group and chairman of the convention, said, Though we still have some way to go from the mindset of control and licensing, there is no doubt that the new India is confident. New India is the flavour of the world and it will be successful, said Goenka.

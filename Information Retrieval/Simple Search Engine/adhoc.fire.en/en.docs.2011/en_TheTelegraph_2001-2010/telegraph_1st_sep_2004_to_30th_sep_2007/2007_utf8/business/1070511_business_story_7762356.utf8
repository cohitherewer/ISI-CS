 Demerger on Bajaj Auto meet menu

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 10: Bajaj Auto, the No. 2 two-wheeler maker of the country, today said its board would meet on May 17 to consider splitting the business.

 The proposed demerger could split the companys auto and financial businesses into separate entities. The value of Bajaj Autos investment portfolio is over Rs 6,000 crore. 

 The company today informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that its board of directors would meet on May 17 to consider a proposal for the demerger, besides taking up the audited financial results and dividend for 2006-07.

 The proposed split, which had been talked about for quite some time now, is expected to unlock value for Bajaj Auto shareholders. 

 Some four years back, chairman Rahul Bajaj had first talked about the demerger. This was after some foreign institutional investors had suggested that a demerger would benefit shareholders given the companys huge treasury operations. Bajaj had then said there was a plan to form two companies one that would concentrate on manufacturing and the other, a separate investment company.

 The idea was to have a holding firm, which would house the auto finance and insurance businesses of Bajaj Auto along with the companys huge treasury operations. The demerged company will hold shares of other subsidiaries such as Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company. 

 However, the proposal did not make much headway for various reasons, including the possibility of a high stamp duty, and the Bajaj Auto board never took it up for discussion. 

 The demerger rumour resurfaced in the beginning of this year and it was felt that the company would implement the split during this calendar year. There were unconfirmed reports that the demerger would be put on a fast track as Rahul Bajajs two sons Rajiv and Sanjiv were not on good terms. This was, however, denied by company officials.

 According to observers tracking Bajaj Auto, if the demerger goes through, Rajiv will head the two-wheeler company, while the financial services entity will be run by Sanjiv.

 Welcoming the Bajaj Auto announcement, an analyst with a local brokerage said, Its been talked about for quite some time now. Therefore, todays formal announcement is positive as it is good for the companys shareholders.

 Cola giants sip local flavours

 KAKOLY CHATTERJEE

 Desi touch

 New Delhi, June 29: Global soft drink companies are planning to add a desi touch to their drinks. Coca-Cola India is test marketing Masala Limca and Mazaa Aam Panna (a drink made from raw mango pulp), while Pepsi plans to introduce variants of mango preparations, juices and nimbu paani.

 In north India, people mix rock salt or other salts to Limca. Taking a cue from this we have developed three flavour powders which can be added to the drink, Coca-Cola sources said. 

 The three flavours are jaljeera, mint and ginger. The flavoured powders will be available in pouches with the neighbourhood cold drink vendor. Coca-Cola officials said, One was not sure about the quality of the additives which were available so far. Coke would now offer pouches prepared under hygienic conditions. 

 Pepsi is silent about the exact flavours and variants its food technologists are working on, though officials said these would include mango preparations and nimbu paani.

 Dabur introduced fruit-based drinks with traditional recipes, called coolers, three years ago in flavours such as aam panna, pomegranate and watermelon. The company earns about Rs 8-10 crore from these drinks. As a regional company we understand consumers better than the global giants and it seems they are now following us, said a senior Dabur executive. 

 Dabur does not plan any more launches in this segment. It will, however, focus on its existing portfolio to deal with the competition. 

 Test marketing of Masala Limca started on June 16 and will continue till the middle of July in Punjab and UP. 

 In Delhi and the NCR region, 77 locations, especially malls, have been identified to introduce Masala Limca. Maaza Aam Panna is being sold in 1,000 select outlets in Agra, Bareilly and Lucknow.

 Analysts said the size of the organised juice industry is 50 million cases. Of this, 85 per cent constitute mango flavoured juices, nectars and fruit drinks. Maaza enjoys a 37 per cent market share out of this. 

 The Aam Panna will be of a spicy, tangy variety, Coke officials said. The flavour will resemble the green or non ripe variety of mango. The drink is being bottled in 200ml tetra packs in Bhopal.

 Biocon weighs global listing 

 Mazumdar-Shaw: Big plans

 Bangalore, Aug. 20 (PTI): Biotech firm Biocon Ltd is looking at acquisitions and may list its shares on international bourses to strengthen its pharmaceutical business.

 We will look at inorganic growth. We definitely have a strategy to look for an appropriate opportunity and grow our pharmaceutical business, Biocon chairman and managing director Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said.

 We will look at an international listing. Thats a very important objective for us, Mazumdar-Shaw said. 

 We will do it at a time when we are really in a position to partner one of our programmes at a very, very high valuation, she added.

 Biocon made a string of announcements in the last couple of months such as striking agreements with Nasdaq-listed Abraxis Bioscience and Invitrgogen, setting up a joint venture in Dubai and divesting its enzymes business for $115 million.

 We focus strongly and have created an infrastructure to address operations in a global scale. Now, we are looking at ways to access global markets, Mazumdar-Shaw said. 

 According to her, West Asia was a large market and the company planned to take advantage of this market.

 She said the company would invest more in its discovery programmes, which had shown a lot of promise and needed investment to unlock huge value. 

 We divested our enzymes business so that the realisation could be used to invest in promising research programmes, she said.

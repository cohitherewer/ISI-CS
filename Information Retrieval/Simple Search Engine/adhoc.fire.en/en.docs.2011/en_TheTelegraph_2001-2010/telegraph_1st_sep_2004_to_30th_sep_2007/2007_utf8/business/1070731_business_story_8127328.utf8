 Calcutta, July 30: McLeod Russel India plans to invest Rs 50 crore in its joint venture D1 Williamson Magor Bio Fuel Ltd in the next couple of years.

 The 50:50 joint venture was formed in July last year by D1 Oils UK and Williamson Magor amp; Co to produce bio-diesel in the east and Northeast.

 The investment will help set up manufacturing facilities of crude oil and refinery, make working capital arrangements and provide initial support for plantation, said Aditya Khaitan, managing director of McLeod Russel. 

 The total investment required to develop production facilities till 2009-10 is approximately Rs 300 crore, he added. Commercial production will start from 2009-10.

 D1 Williamson Magor is promoting jatropha plantation on the wasteland that farmers own under contract farming. This will help the company use jatropha oil seeds to make bio-diesel. 

 The company has undertaken plantation on about 8,000 hectares during 2006 and plans to undertake 50,000 hectares each year from 2007 onwards. The plantation on 29,000 hectares has already been completed in 2007. By 2011-12, it plans to grow the crop in 200,000 hectares of land.

 McLeod will invest Rs 15 crore to step up its orthodox tea production from 3 million kg to 10 million kg in the next three years.

 The prices for the orthodox are higher by Rs 15 per kg. This year, Sri Lanka has a spot shortage of 18 million kg in orthodox tea, which could be leveraged.

 For the first quarter of this year, the company recorded a lower selling price of Rs 88.81 per kg against Rs 91.07 per kg for the same quarter last fiscal.

 Though sales volumes are up by 5 lakh kg from 78 lakh kg to 83 lakh kg for the first quarter, export volumes are lower by 13 lakh kg because of rupee appreciation and a bumper crop from Kenya.

 The company posted income from operations of Rs 73.55 crore in the first quarter compared with Rs 71.09 crore for the same quarter last fiscal.

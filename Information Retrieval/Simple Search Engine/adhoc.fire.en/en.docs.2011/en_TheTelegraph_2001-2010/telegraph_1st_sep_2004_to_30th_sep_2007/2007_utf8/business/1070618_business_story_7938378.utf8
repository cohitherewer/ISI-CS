 Life and health

 Srikumar Bondyopadhyay 

 strikes an insurance balance

 Wanted A single insurance 

 product that will pay medical bills and also provide life 

 cover. 

 Available options

 Health insurance and personal 

 accident policies from non-life insurers. Life insurance 

 policies with attached riders covering some critical illnesses.

 Two-in-one choice

 Standalone health covers by life 

 insurers. The cover not only pays for health costs but also 

 includes death benefits. 

 In case of the insurers death, 

 the benefit goes to the nominee. The amount paid is usually 

 the difference between the sum assured and any hospitalisation 

 or medical costs paid within the policy term.

 Longer term

 The term of health policies sold 

 by life insurance companies is three to five years compared 

 with one year in case of non-life insurers. 

 Flat premium

 Life insurers charge a flat premium 

 for the term of the policy, that is, a block of three or 

 five years. So you pay the same premium for three to five 

 years if you buy a health plan from a life insurer irrespective 

 of whether you make a claim in the interim period or not. 

 But a non-life insurer may increase your premium each year 

 depending on the claim experience.

 Higher sum assured

 General insurance companies offer 

 health covers up to Rs 5 lakh. But life insurance companies 

 provide a higher coverage of Rs 7 lakh or Rs 10 lakh in 

 their health policies.

 Big premium

 However, the premium rates for 

 such health plans are costlier than those of non-life insurers. 

 For example, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company charges 

 a premium (fixed for three years) of around Rs 2,500 for 

 a sum assured of Rs 1 lakh for people between 30 and 35 

 years. The National Insurance Company charges Rs 1,546 for 

 the same person.

 There is a mortality charge towards 

 life coverage in our health plan, said Sam Ghosh, CEO of 

 Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company. 

 The premium cost in health plans 

 of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance is higher. However, with 

 other life insurers such as the LIC lining up their health 

 insurance plans, premium rates could fall. 

 Part payment

 Life insurers, like their non-life 

 counterparts, ask policyholders to pay a part of their medical 

 bills. Therefore, even if you buy a health plan from a life 

 insurer, you will have to save enough money to pay for part 

 of the bills. This becomes difficult after retirement. 

 An increase of 11.6 years in our 

 average longevity to 68.6 years in 2007 from 57 years in 

 1990 implies that we are living well beyond our working 

 life with paltry income from past savings. Healthcare costs 

 are also rising fast. According to Crisil research analyst 

 Binaifer Jehani, hospitalisation costs alone have gone up 

 by 15 to 20 per cent in the last one year. A recent study 

 by Ficci and Ernst and Young says that over the next 10 

 years, healthcare spending in India will double.

 Correct choice

 Before drawing up your life insurance 

 plan, first understand what you need, why and how much.

 Life insurance will protect your 

 family from financial crisis if something unfortunate happens 

 to you. So, what you need is a cover for your working life. 

 You need a health plan primarily for your retired life when 

 health costs go up and income dries up. 

 The quantum of life cover you 

 need will depend on your present income and lifestyle. The 

 purpose of buying a life insurance is to ensure that the 

 future financial liabilities of your family are adequately 

 covered and your family can maintain the same standard of 

 living in your absence. This works out to be a hefty sum, 

 which means a big premium. So, the next step is to look 

 for the lowest cost policy that provides the required life 

 cover. 

 Pure term-assurance policies are 

 the cheapest. For example, in SBI Lifes Shield you can 

 opt for an increase of sum assured by 50 per cent every 

 five years. For a 25-year term and sum assured of Rs 10 

 lakh (with an accident cover of Rs 10 lakh), you will have 

 to pay an annual premium of only Rs 7,031 if you are 30 

 years old. In the event of your death at the age of 40, 

 your family will get Rs 20 lakh. If you die at 50, your 

 family will get Rs 30 lakh. 

 There are, however, other cheaper 

 plans where the sum assured remains the same throughout 

 the policy term. 

 You can now buy a family-floater 

 health plan with a sum assured of Rs 3 lakh for an annual 

 premium of Rs 5,000. By choosing this combination, you can 

 restrict your total annual premium outgo for life and health 

 insurance together to Rs 12,000 per annum, or Rs 1,000 per 

 month.

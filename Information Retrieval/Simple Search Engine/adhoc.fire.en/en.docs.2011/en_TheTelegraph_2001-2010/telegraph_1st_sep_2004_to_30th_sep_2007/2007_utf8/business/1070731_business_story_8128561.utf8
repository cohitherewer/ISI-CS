 Drill begins for please-all formula on iron ore

 New Delhi, July 30: Steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan said he had objections to proposals for allocation of iron ore mines instead of an auction.

 He said his ministry was likely to stand firm on a plan to shift to the allocation process. The group of ministers wanted a national stance. We cannot starve steel plants, such as RINL, which is in Andhra Pradesh where there is no iron ore, of raw materials because local governments insist on linking resource allocation to steel plants being set up in their states, Paswan told The Telegraph. 

 However, top officials said the Centre would try to accommodate the views of chief ministers who are opposed to auctions on the grounds of loss of investments. 

 In ore rich Jharkhand and Orissa, steel companies are keen to set up units provided they are assured of adequate supply of the mineral.

 The officials said there was the possibility of the Centre going in for a weightage system, under which priority would be given to companies who want to set up a plant within a state. However, the system may not work if a company with no interests in the state where the mine is located tables a substantially higher bid.

 Besides, investment commitments made for the state may turn out to be dubious, resulting in the breakdown of the weightage system.

 The system is still being worked out, officials said, adding it was not possible to disregard opinions of ore-rich states.

 However, they admitted that it was not possible to ignore objections of states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat and Bengal, which need to get ore from outside, to the allocation system.

 These states would lose out on investments in the absence of auctions. A few weeks ago, the government had hammered out a new mineral policy that proposed auctions by states without any restrictive clauses such as of steel plants within their boundaries.

 The group of ministers preparing the policy favoured auctions because it was a more transparent way of allocating resources. 

 Auctions would also avoid situations where states rich in other minerals such as coal and manganese could refuse to part with their resources unless mills were set up within their boundaries.

 The draft policy has also not imposed quantitative or qualitative caps on iron ore exports. It has accepted the Hooda committee recommendation of using varying tax rates to discourage exports of high- grade ore.

 The officials said this has sparked a serious lobbying war with steel makers insisting on a qualitative cap to disallow exports of high-grade ore. The Indian Steel Alliance also wants a quantitative cap on export at 2006 levels as a huge surge in capacity will require most of the countrys limited reserves. 

 Last year, exports were estimated at about 90 million tonnes, more than half of which went to China.

 The Federation of Indian Mineral Industries, which represents ore exporters, says there are enough reserves to take care of the needs of both the steel industry and exporters. It says 80 per cent of ore exports comprises low-grade fines that are not used by steel mills. The draft norms were finalised by the group of ministers at their meeting here on July 6. 

 According to the minister of state for mines, T. Subbarami Reddy, the government expects $2 billion of foreign direct investment after the new policy is in place. He said the sector would also generate five lakh more jobs in the next five years.

 Earlier, the cabinet had referred the policy to a group of ministers headed by home minister Shivraj Patil to address issues facing both the steel and mining industry and recommend a policy conducive for the overall growth of the two industries.

 The group has broadly endorsed the recommendations of the Anwarul Hooda committee, sources said. 

 They had heard representatives of both industries, besides environment experts, to get a complete picture.

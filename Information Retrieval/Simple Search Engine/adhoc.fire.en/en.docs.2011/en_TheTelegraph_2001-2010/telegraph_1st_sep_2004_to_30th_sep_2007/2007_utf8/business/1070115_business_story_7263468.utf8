 India Inc caveat on full float

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 14: India Inc has backed the views of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and noted global financier George Soros on exercising caution before making the rupee fully convertible.

 In a joint study conducted by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), the World Bank and Crisil, industry emphasised that India should fulfil certain imperatives before going in for capital account convertibility.

 The measures suggested by corporate India include developing and ensuring compliance to sound risk management practices, maintaining global standards in provisioning, capital adequacy norms, strengthening banking provisions and reducing dependence on one-way inflow.

 The rupee is convertible on the current account since 1994 but is not fully convertible on the capital account. 

 Last week, Singh said at Ficcis annual general meeting, The recommendations of the Tarapore committee are a step in this direction, mixing caution with optimism.

 Last year, an RBI panel, under S.S. Tarapore, prepared a roadmap for full convertibility over the next five years in three phases.

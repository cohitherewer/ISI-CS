 Institutions to help Aban in Sinvest buy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 1: Aban Offshore Ltd, which is in the process of acquiring Sinvest ASA, will issue convertible notes on a private placement basis to institutional investors in its wholly owned subsidiary Aban Singapore Pte Ltd (ASPL). 

 These notes, which will be mandatorily converted into shares, will give the investors close to 10.37 per cent holding in ASPL. 

 The notes are being issued to part finance the acquisition of Sinvest ASA. The transaction, one of the largest M amp;A deals by an Indian company, gives an enterprise value of $1.8 billion for Sinvest.

 Aban Offshore has now made a $800-million (Rs 3,600 crore) offer to acquire the remaining 66.24 per cent stake in Sinvest ASA, a move that will place Aban among the top 10 companies in the field. The company had acquired a 33.76 per cent stake in Sinvest for $446 million last year. 

 The mandatory open offer would be presented by Aban International Norway, a new wholly owned subsidiary of ASPL incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of Norway.

 Sinvest is a large jack-up drilling company having three newly built premium jack-up drilling rigs and five jack-up drilling rigs at various stages of construction in Singapore shipyards. It also owns a 50 per cent stake in Venture Drilling AS, a Norwegian company.

 Aban Offshore is an offshore drilling service provider with a fleet of seven jack-up drilling rigs and two drillships. 

 Punjab National Bank (PNB) and ICICI Bank Ltd acted as the lead arrangers for the senior credit facilities for Aban International Norway.

 The State Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce also participated in the senior credit facilities arranged by PNB. 

 Aban said to finance the cost of acquisition, ASPL is raising funds by way of a convertible note issue of $150 million. 

 Merrill Lynch will act as placement agent for the convertible note placement. The notes are convertible into equity shares of ASPL at a base conversion price that will give a 10.37 per cent holding (post conversion) to the noteholders. 

 ASPL has also raised a medium-term facility of up to $100 million to finance a part of the cost of acquisition, which was fully underwritten by UTI Bank.

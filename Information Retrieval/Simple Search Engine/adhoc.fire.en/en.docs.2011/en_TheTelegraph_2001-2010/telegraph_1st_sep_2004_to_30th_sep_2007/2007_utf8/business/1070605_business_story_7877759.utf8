 Premji son Rishad to be in thick of things at Wipro 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 4: Azim Premji, the 61-year-old chairman of Wipro, may have finally put his succession plan in place: he is inducting elder son Rishad into the Rs 14,943-crore ($3.47 billion) IT and software services company.

 Rishad (30), who graduated from Harvard Business School and worked with consulting firm Bain amp; Co in London, will be joining as business manager in the banking and financial services vertical.

 Premji is the fourth richest Indian after Laxmi Mittal and the Ambani brothers, Mukesh and Anil, with Forbes magazine estimating his wealth at $14 billion (Rs 57,400 crore)

 Two years ago about the time that Vivek Paul quit as managing director of Wipro amid reports of differences with Premji there were rumours that Rishad would join the company. 

 It didnt happen. Rishad will have to first learn the ropes before he gets to shoulder more responsibilities.

 Rishad had graduated from the Wesleyan University in the US and worked with General Electric before heading to Harvard for his MBA.

 A statement from Wipro said Rishad would be joining the company at a level commensurate with his background and experience. As he was a relative of a director, Wipro said his appointment had been cleared by the board and would be subject to shareholders approval. Azim Premji, who controls close to 80 per cent of Wipro, has consistently maintained in the past that he was not in a hurry to bring his son into the company. At one point of time, he had said that neither of his two sons might join the company. 

 Younger son Tariq works with the Azim Premji Foundation which looks after child development and educational initiatives. Premji is reputed to be a tough-talking, no-nonsense employer with a modest lifestyle. 

 He travels economy class and recent reports said he had turned down Rishads request to stay at Wipros guest house in London on the ground that it was company property. 

 Last year, Rishads marriage was a very low-key affair in Mumbai and in sharp contrast to the ostentation of Laxmi Mittals daughters marriage in Paris.

 Premji had indicated in the past that he would not name one of his sons as a successor to merely comply with convention and that there could be two potential successors, one of whom could be a professional from within the company. 

 Out of the 79.58 per cent promoters holding in Wipro, Azim Premji personally owns 5.6 crore shares (or 3.84 per cent). Rishad holds a little over 6.18 lakh shares of Wipro. However, a large chunk of the promoter group stakes is held through three companies within the group Hasham Traders, Prazim Traders and Zash Traders all of which hold over 22 per cent each.

 The Azim Premji Foundation holds over 83 lakh shares in the company but Premji has disclaimed beneficial ownership of this stake.

 Azim Premji was forced to quit studies at Stanford University, California, at the age of 21 to take over the family business of vegetable oils when his father M.H. Premji, suddenly passed away in 1966. 

 The vanaspati manufacturing company, Western India Vegetable Products Ltd, later became Wipro. It has a market capitalisation of over $20 billion and straddles businesses like software services, soaps and lighting.

 RPG firm cashes in on carbon credit

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 19: Phillips Carbon Black Limited (PCBL), an RPG Enterprises group company, has become the first carbon black firm to rake in Rs 2.85 crore by selling carbon credit.

 The company has sold certified carbon emission units (CERs) from waste heat utilisation at its Baroda plant.

 Phillips Carbon Black is generating power at Baroda by utilising process flue gases from carbon black manufacturing.

 The gas, which was earlier flared, is already generating 12 mw of electricity following an investment of Rs 41 crore.

 After meeting the plants own power demand of 4.5 mw, the remaining is being sold to the Gujarat State Electricity Board. The earnings from this in the current year are estimated at Rs 14 crore. The company is also saving Rs 10 crore a year on power purchase.

 Mastek takes control of US company

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 American dream

 Mumbai, July 16: Mastek Ltd has acquired a 90 per cent stake in the US-based Vector Insurance Services for nearly $9 million.

 This acquisition reinforces our solutions-driven offerings in the high-opportunity US insurance market. Vector fits very well with our overall strategy to be a leader in providing end-to-end IT solutions within the insurance vertical, MajescoMastek president William McCarter said.

 According to the agreement, Masteks wholly owned US subsidiary MajescoMastek will buy a 90 per cent equity stake in Vector for $4.5 million. A similar amount will be paid over the next two years based on business performance.

 The acquisition is being funded through internal accruals and the sum will be paid partly in cash and partly by way of future cash earnings, Mastek said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 Vector is the first-of-its-kind acquisition by Mastek in the insurance vertical. The deal will strengthen our revenue and earnings further, and will provide an access to a larger customer base for our service-oriented architecture based life and annuity enterprise platform, Elixir. We are constantly looking forward more such international acquisitions, Mastek chairman Sudhakar Ram told The Telegraph. 

 The acquisition will strengthen Masteks operations in the US insurance vertical and enable greater value for its shareholders over the long term. Following this transaction, Vector would operate as VectorMastek, it added.

 Vector reported revenues of $4.2 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2006. 

 The integration of VectorMastek with Masteks existing operations is expected to be completed in about 30 days and its contribution will be reflected in Masteks consolidated performance this year onwards, the company said.

 The existing management team of Vector will continue to look after the business, led by its founder Harold Apple, who will report to MajescoMastek president McCarter. Other managers and employees will also be retained.

 Shares of Mastek jumped 17 per cent on the BSE and closed at Rs 333.15 on Monday.

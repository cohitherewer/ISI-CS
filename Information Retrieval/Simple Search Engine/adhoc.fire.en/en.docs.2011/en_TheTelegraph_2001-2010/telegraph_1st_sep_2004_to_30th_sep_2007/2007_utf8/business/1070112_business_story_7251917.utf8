 Sarin ready to partner Ambani in bid for Hutch Essar

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: Vodafone CEO Arun Sarin seems keen to head off a bruising battle for Hutchison Essar.

 While Sarin said the Ruias of the Essar group were its natural partner for its biggest buyout deal in India, he added that he was ready to rope in Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications as a partner as well.

 The Ruias hold 33 per cent in Hutchison Essar and anyone hoping to buy into the company will have to deal with them. 

 The overture to Reliance Communications was a real surprise, especially since the younger Ambani scion has just been authorised by his board of directors to create a war chest to mount its bid for the countrys fourth largest telephony major.

 We are a partnership kind of people, we are open to everything, Sarin said.

 Neither the Ruias nor the Ambanis responded to Sarins overture even as the clock ticks down to a mid-February deadline that Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing appears to have set so that he can wrap things up before the Chinese New Year on February 18.

 Reliance Communications chairman Anil Ambani today met finance minister P. Chidambaram and senior officials of the department of telecom (DoT) to discuss issues related to his companys intended bid to acquire Hutchison Essar, even as it started the due diligence exercise.

 He (Anil Ambani) also met department of telecom secretary D.S. Mathur and is planning to meet communications minister Dayanidhi Maran, sources said.

 Ambanis meeting comes just a day after Sarin and Essar chairman Shashi Ruia met Chidambaram yesterday.

 With both Sarin and Ambani in town, there was a buzz of excitement with many speculating on the possible outcome in the event of a meeting between the two strongest contenders.

 Spokespersons of the telecom firms refused to give any details or confirm that such a meeting had taken place between the heads.

 Sarin yesterday expressed readiness to join hands with Essar, describing it as a good potential partner.

 While Reliance Communications started due diligence of Hutchison Essar in Mumbai today, the bankers of Ruias-promoted Essar, which is understood to be keen on bidding for the 67 per cent stake of its foreign partner Hutchison Telecommunications International, had started confirmatory diligence of Hutchison Essar.

 Sarin said Vodafone, which started poring over the books early this week, would complete the exercise in a couple of weeks and a formal bid could be submitted in the next few weeks.

 In case Vodafones acquisition of Hutchison Essar comes off, India will account for its third largest customer base. The UK-based company operates in 27 markets globally. Germany is the largest market for Vodafone with 29 million subscribers, while the US (where it has a 44.4 per cent stake in Verizon) is the second largest.

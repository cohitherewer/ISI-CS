 Mumbai, June 4: Hyderabad-based Rain Calcining Ltd will acquire the US firm CII Carbon LLC for $595 million in an all-cash deal. 

 The acquisition will be made through its US subsidiary, Rain/CII Holdings Inc. 

 The combined entity will be the worlds largest producer of calcined petroleum coke (CPC) with a capacity of over 2.4 million tonnes. CPC is a raw material used in aluminium. It is also used in the manufacture of titanium dioxide and steel.

 The privately held company, has a diversified customer base spread across many countries.

 The acquisition will enable Rain Calcining to capture many synergies and growth opportunities offered by the overseas company. Moreover, the company will be able to achieve annual sales of about $550 million.

 CII Carbon will handle the supply and marketing responsibilities of Rain Calcining in the future. Citi and ICICI Bank will arrange for finances for the acquisition. Rain Commodities (USA), a subsidiary of group company Rain Commodities Ltd, expects to invest $92 million in convertible non-voting preferred stock in Rain/CII Holdings to part-finance the acquisition. 

 The transaction will be finalised by June. The company said it would double its capacity to about 1 million tonnes by adding two new kilns in Vishakhapatnam by 2009.

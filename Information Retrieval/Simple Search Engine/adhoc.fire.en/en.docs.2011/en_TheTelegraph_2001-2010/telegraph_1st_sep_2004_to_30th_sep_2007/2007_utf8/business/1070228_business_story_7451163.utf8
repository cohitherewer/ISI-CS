The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Deal sealed for HM idle land

 Development mode

 Calcutta, Feb. 27: Uttarpara, some 15 kilometres from Calcutta, is all set to get a swanky high-tech city for NRIs along with two industrial parks one for information technology and the other for auto components.

 Bangalore-based Shriram Properties has promised to stump up Rs 2,500 crore to develop the projects in collaboration with possibly an American company.

 Today, Shriram inked a deal with Hindustan Motors (HM) to commercially develop 314 acres of idle land where the countrys oldest automobile plant is situated.

 The city and parks will come up over the next 5-7 years under the aegis of a new special purpose vehicle (SPV) where HM and Shriram will have stakes.

 M. Murali, managing director of Shriram Properties, told The Telegraph that 54 acres have been earmarked for auto and IT parks while 170 acres have been set aside for the township. The rest 90 acres will have water bodies and road infrastructure.

 The place is well connected. Once the second Vivekananda bridge comes up, one can reach airport in 15-20 minutes, Murali said.

 Once fully developed, Hooghly will have two large organised townships: Dankuni by DLF and Uttarpara by Shriram.

 Murali is confident that IT and auto ancillary companies can be roped in for the parks.

 We are engaged in many such developments in south India, he added.

 According to Murali, could consider seeking special economic zone (SEZ) status for the parks.

 It is in talks with few US companies and the partner would be chosen shortly.

 The deal will not only foster auto industry in Bengal with Tata Motors Singur plant close by but will also revive the beleaguered HM.

 It will get Rs 295 crore in five tranches over the next two-and-a-half years, a stake in the SPV and also a non-compete fee equal to 4 per cent of the sales proceeds that Murali estimated to be Rs 3,500 crore.

 Q amp;A

 Banking blues

 I am 72 years old. I deposited Rs 25,000 in the Super Income scheme of the United Bank of Indias Rajpur branch. The scheme offered an interest rate of 10.25 per cent to senior citizens. But when the bank sent me the FD certificate it mentioned 9.75 per cent as rate of interest. I wrote to the manager highlighting the mistake. He promised to rectify it. But they are yet to do it. What should I do?

 Kashi Nath Bhattacharjee, Rajpur

 If the branch manager fails to redress your problem or explain why he is unable to do so within a month of your complaint, you should approach the banking ombudsman at the Reserve Bank. The ombudsman, C.V. George, who looks after Bengal and Sikkim, can be reached at Reserve Bank of India, 15, Nethaji Subhas Road, Calcutta-700 001.Telephone numbers are (033) 22306222; 22305580. Fax number: (033) 22305899. Email: bokolkatarbi.org.in.

 Tax on pension 

 I am 77 years old. My total annual income is less than Rs 1 lakh from all sources, including pension. According to an order of the Supreme Court, we were awarded an increase of pension with retrospective effect. A sum of Rs 1.75 lakh will be due on account of arrears since September 1998. The pension arrears will be paid this year. So, my total income will be Rs 3 lakh. Will the pension arrears be taxed as this years income? Do I have to submit income tax returns?

 S.C. Chakravorty, Calcutta 

 Pension is a periodical payment received by an employee after his retirement and is taxable as salary according to section 17(1)(ii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Pension, including arrears of pension is chargeable to tax on accrual basis, that is in the year of receipt. However, in respect of arrears the assessee can claim relief under section 89(1). Since you will have to pay income tax, you will have to file income returns. 

 Rental income

 Under which income category should the rental income from a taxi fall? Also tell me which income return should I submit for tax purposes?

 N. Majumdar, Calcutta

 If it is a rental income in the true sense of the term, it will fall under the head of income from other sources and you can use form ITR 2 for filing returns.

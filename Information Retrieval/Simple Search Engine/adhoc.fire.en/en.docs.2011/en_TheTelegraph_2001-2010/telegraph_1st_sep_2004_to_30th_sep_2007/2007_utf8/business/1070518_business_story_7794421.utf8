 Higher support price for paddy, pulses

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 17: The government has raised the minimum support price for paddy by Rs 65 per quintal. 

 The price is Rs 645 per quintal for the common grade rice and Rs 675 for the A grade.

 The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) also raised the support price for lentils such as arhar, moong and uradh.

 Inadequate supplies of lentil and wheat had pushed up the prices of these commodities. The higher support prices are expected to encourage farmers to produce lentils.

 The support price for arhar was hiked by Rs 180 to Rs 1,590 per quintal. 

 The higher prices will be effective from October 1.

 After the CCEA meet, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar said the government wanted to raise the acreage under pulses.

 Pawar said this would reduce its import.

 He said the Food Corporation of India has procured 96 lakh tonnes of wheat in the rabi season compared with 91 lakh tonnes in the previous year.

 ITI recast

 The CCEA also approved a financial assistance of Rs 352 crore to Indian Telephone Industries (ITI) for payment of statutory dues and VRS.

 It also gave its nod to an interest-free loan of Rs 25 crore to the company.

 In another decision, the Union cabinet referred the revival of Indian Drugs and Pharmaceutical Limited to the group of ministers.

 The package that included waivers and fresh cash infusion of up to Rs 2,600 crore was approved by the Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises.

 The CCEA deferred a decision on a proposal to allow public sector companies invest their surplus funds in mutual funds.

 The matter has been referred to a committee of secretaries, finance minister P. Chidambaram said after the meeting.

 Pune, June 18: Tata Motors today launched two light vehicles in commercial and passenger segments the Magic and the Winger. The company has spent close to Rs 400 crore in developing these vehicles at its Pune plant.

 The Magic, a diesel vehicle developed on the platform of the Ace, can accommodate four to seven passengers. It has been designed for rural and semi-urban areas and has been priced at Rs 2.6 lakh onwards (ex-showroom Pune). The vehicle, backed by a 36,000km/ 12-month warranty, has a speed limit of 64 km per hour and a 700cc engine.

 The Winger has three variants in a price range of Rs 4.7 lakh to Rs 6.55 lakh (ex-showroom Pune). The 9-13 seater vehicle is powered by a two-litre turbo-charged diesel engine, the same as for the Tata Sumo.

 The company said it would soon launch petrol and CNG variants of the Winger. However, a petrol model might not be feasible for the Magic.

 Tata Motors has always been at the forefront with its commitment to offer transportation solutions, which will change the way India travels. The Magic and the Winger are our latest initiatives in that direction and more will follow, said P.M. Telang, executive director of Tata Motors commercial vehicle business unit.

 Both the vehicles will be manufactured at the Pune plant, which has the capacity to make 200,000-250,000 units a year. We will make both these vehicles in our Pune plant. Later, however, we may have to compromise with our Ace production to give way to the Magic. The Ace will then be produced at our Uttarakhand plant, Telang said.

 Although the company refused to divulge its volume target for these vehicles, Telang said, Our plant has a manufacturing capacity of about 5,000-7,000 units per month. We may ramp up our production according to the demand.

 Meanwhile, officials said the fixtures and the machinery for the Winger were second-hand and have been bought from Renault, France. They said these machinery were originally used to manufacture the Renault Traffic and were bought a year back.

 The Magic and the Winger will initially be produced for the Maharashtra and Gujarat markets. The vehicles will be rolled out in other parts of the country in the next four to six months.

 Tata Motors, which has a market share of about 47 per cent in the passenger vehicle market, has manufacturing facilities in Pune, Lucknow and Jamshedpur.

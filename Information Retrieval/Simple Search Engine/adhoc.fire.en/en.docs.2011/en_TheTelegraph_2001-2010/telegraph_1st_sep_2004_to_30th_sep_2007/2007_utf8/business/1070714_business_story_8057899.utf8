 Mumbai, July 13: The Central Bank of India today announced a price band of Rs 85-102 per share for its initial public offering (IPO), which will open for subscription on July 24. The public sector bank will raise between Rs 680 crore and Rs 816 crore depending on the price, which will be arrived through book-building.

 Issue proceeds will be used to raise the capital base, comply with Basel II norms, meet the projected growth in assets and fund technology modernisation. 

 After the issue, the governments holding will come down to 80.20 per cent from 100 per cent. 

 Employees will get 40 lakh shares as part of a quota, while the general public will get 76 lakh shares. 

 The issue will constitute 24.68 per cent of the pre-issue and 19.80 per cent of the post-issue paid-up equity capital of the bank. 

 Rating agency CARE has given a rating of four that indicates above-average fundamentals.

 The Central Bank has 3,194 branches, the third largest in India.

 Of these, 1,341 branches are in rural areas, 759 in semi-urban areas and 575 in urban areas. There are also 519 branches in the metros. 

 The bank is now focusing on three main areas corporate, retail and agriculture. 

 Speaking to reporters here today, H.A. Daruwalla, chairperson and managing director of the bank, said the capital adequacy ratio would rise to 11.80 per cent after the issue from 10.40 per cent now. 

 Though its non-performing assets are the highest among PSU banks, Daruwalla said that the bank had placed a target of bringing the gross NPAs down to below 2 per cent from 4.81 per cent as on March 31, 2007. 

 The target for net NPAs is below 1 per cent.

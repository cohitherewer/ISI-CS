 Rate-cut rush ruled out 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 19: Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke has made his first rate cut: a 50-basis-point cut in the federal funds rate. But bankers in Mumbai do not expect to see Reserve Bank governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy take a cue from him anytime soon.

 They reckon that a rate cut if it does come about will be triggered by local factors. It will be influenced by the Indian scenario and not driven by what happens overseas, said D.K. Joshi, director and principal economist at Crisil.

 This means disappointment for home loan borrowers who have been looking forward to some respite from the burden of rising equated monthly instalments.

 Interest rates on housing loans have risen by at least 4 percentage points since 2004 and it does seem as though they will remain at those levels for a while.

 Borrowers saw a ray of hope when a few banks and housing finance companies announced lower interest rates on new home loans recently. Late last month, the Bank of Baroda and a few others made new home loans cheaper by 25 to 50 basis points. This was, however, packaged as a monsoon offer. 

 It (the rate cut) depends on our borrowing costs, which is a function of what the central bank does, said an official with a leading housing finance company. At this juncture, it seems that interest rates will hold steady.

 Since 2004, the central bank has raised the reverse repo rate the return banks earn on excess funds parked with the central bank by 125 basis points, while the cash reserve ratio (CRR) has been nudged upwards by 150 basis points to curb inflationary expectations. 

 Bankers and senior economists reckon that two factors inflation and growth of the economy will influence Reddys decision on rates.

 Although inflation has shown signs of easing over the past few weeks, Joshi feels that inflationary pressures still exist in the economy. 

 One reason for this is the surge in world crude prices, which touched $82 per barrel today.

 My guess is that the RBI will follow a wait-and-watch policy, Joshi added.

 Harihar Krishnamurthy of Development Credit Bank said, The situation in India is different from the US and rates will be trimmed only after various things fall into place.

 The RBI is slated to announce its mid-term review of the annual policy statement for 2007-08 on October 30. While bankers expect a status quo in key policy rates, it is felt that there could be a reduction only in January.

 Mutuals pie to rise in IPO 

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

Mumbai, Jan. 7: The dream run of the bourses is set to continue in 2007 as well.

 If all goes well, the year could emerge as the biggest for the primary market with almost Rs 40,000 crore issues in the pipeline, according to Prithvi Haldea of Prime Database.

 To add to the cheer, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is believed to be all set to increase the mutual fund quota in initial public offerings (IPO) to 10 per cent from 5 per cent.

 Under the current regulations, of the 50 per cent shares reserved for qualified institutional bidders (QIB), 5 per cent is for mutual funds. They can also bid for the remaining 45 per cent of the QIB quota. Thirty-five per cent shares on offer are reserved for the retail segment and 15 per cent for high net worth individuals (HNI).

 According to sources, Sebi has now decided to raise the 5 per cent limit to 10 per cent. However, it is not known whether the additional 5 per cent will be carved from the overall QIB portion or from the retail quota.

 Though it could not be confirmed from the market regulator, the announcement is expected anytime this week, even Tuesday.

 It would indeed be a superior move and could not come at a better time with so many initial public offerings in the pipeline. And enhancing the quota for mutual funds actually means raising the same for individual investors and increasing their chances of participating in any issue, said Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research.

 In the last 15 years, the total amount mobilised from the primary market was Rs 75,000 crore. 

 If the bull run continues, the amount expected to be mobilised only for the current year is Rs 40,000 crore. While such numbers do reflect the strength of the economy, it also appears disturbing to a certain extent. 

 And this increased institutionalisation will translate into rigorous evaluation, thereby reducing risks, said Kumar.

 According to market experts, QIB response is always a good indicator of IPO quality, and since QIBs now have to put down a margin money of 10 per cent, they are much less likely to display false enthusiasm.

 Last year was one of the best years for primary issues, given the phenomenal returns generated by them. The year saw 73 initial public offerings mobilising Rs 19,324 crore, 93 per cent more than Rs 9,990 crore mobilised by 53 offers during 2005. Of the 63 of the 73 issues that have listed till date, 61 offered an exit at a premium on the listing date, with the gains exceeding 20 per cent in 46 issues and exceeding 10 per cent in 56, according to data compiled by Prime Database. 

 Haldea has recently gone on records saying for 2007, the IPO pipeline is not just full, it is bursting with offers from good companies. If the market stays stable, about Rs 40,000 crore of IPOs could materialise in 2007. These will include issues from DLF, Fortis, BSE, Idea, Mindtree, NHPC and PFC.

 Sebi had made PAN mandatory for all transactions in shares and derivatives from January 1 and had issued KYC guidelines to mutual funds wherein investors investing Rs 50,000 or more in a mutual fund scheme would have to obtain a Mutual Fund Identification Number (MIN).

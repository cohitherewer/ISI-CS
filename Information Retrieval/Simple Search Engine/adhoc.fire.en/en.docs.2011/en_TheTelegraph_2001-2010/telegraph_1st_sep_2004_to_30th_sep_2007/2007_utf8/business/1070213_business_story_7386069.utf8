The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Deal deluge drowns market

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 12 : The big-ticket deals in Hindalco and Hutchison Essar failed to impress the markets, with the sensex wilting under selling pressure to lose 348.20 points today.

 The high inflation rate and stretched valuations in many stocks also gave the jitters to investors who clobbered shares across the board in all the major segments, notably finance, real estate, cement, telecom and metals.

 At the end of the day the sensex lost 2.39 per cent to close at 14190.70, its lowest since the end of January.

 The big losers of the day were Hindalco, which announced the takeover of Novelis, and Reliance Communications (R-Com), which lost out to Vodafone in the race for Hutchison Essar. Both the deals happened yesterday.

 Hindalco Industries, which is acquiring Novelis Inc for around $6 billion, today plummeted 13.74 per cent, or Rs 23.80, to close at Rs 149.45, a eight-month closing low on the BSE. Investors were not as optimistic as the Birlas over the deal as they feared the impact of the transaction on its balance sheet in the short-term. 

 Investors were also disappointed at R-Com losing the race for Hutchison Essar. They felt that the acquisition of Hutchisons stake in the company would not only have made the Anil Ambani group company the leading telecom player in the country but also would have fetched it many premium customers.

 The heavy selling in R-Com on the BSE pulled down the scrip by Rs 20.55, or 4.32 per cent, to Rs 455 at the end of the day.

 The other prominent loser was Suzlon which also made waves with its takeover offer on Friday for German company REpower. Shares in the company fell by Rs 164.95 on concerns similar to the ones expressed by investors in Hindalco.

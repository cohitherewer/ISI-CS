 Suzuki moves into top gear

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Manesar, Feb. 6: Suzuki Motor Corporation will invest Rs 10,800 crore in its Indian operations by 2010.

 The Japanese carmaker has already announced an investment of about Rs 9,000 crore for Maruti Udyog Ltd and Suzuki Powertrain India Ltd (SPIL), which would include capacity expansion, development of new models and extension of research and development.

 The investment will also flow into Maruti Udyogs fourth car assembly and SPILs diesel engine and transmission plant at Manesar. These were inaugurated today by Osamu Suzuki, chairman and CEO of Suzuki Motor.

 SPIL is a joint venture of Suzuki Motor and Maruti Udyog, in which Suzuki Motor has a 70 per cent stake and Maruti Udyog holds the rest. SPIL has an initial capacity to manufacture 1 lakh diesel engines a year. This will be scaled up to 3 lakh engines per year by 2010. SPIL will manufacture transmissions for a million vehicles by 2008, Suzuki said.

 Another Rs 1,000 crore will be invested in the plants of Maruti Udyog and SPIL for capital expenditure.

 The car assembly plant at Manesar has a capacity to manufacture 1 lakh units per year. This will be scaled up to three lakh units per year at an investment of Rs 2,500 crore. The company manufactures the Swift in this plant. It will also manufacture an export model which will be launched in 2008-09.

 Suzuki Motor was fully committed to transferring technology to Maruti Udyog.

 Suzuki Motor has a 54 per cent stake in Maruti and there is nothing to hide. We are not rival companies and, therefore, we will transfer 100 per cent technology, Suzuki said.

 Maruti Udyogs fourth car plant and SPILs diesel transmission facility are located in the same campus in Manesar.

 The campus will also have a suppliers park and research and development facilities, a company statement said.

 With the launch of these facilities in Manesar, Maruti, which sold about 6,30,000 cars last year, has set a target to sell a million cars in India by 2010.

 Motorcycle foray

 Suzuki has also inaugurated Suzuki Motors two-wheeler plant in Gurgaon Suzuki Motorcycle India Private Limited. Around Rs 720 crore will be invested in this plant, officials said.

 Suzuki Motorcycle will foray into the domestic scooter market by July this year. 

 The company now has a capacity to manufacture 1 lakh motorcycles. We have created an additional one lakh capacity to produce scooters, which will enter the market probably by July, said Satya Sheel, managing director of Suzuki Motorcycle.

 This will take the companys total production capacity to 2 lakh two-wheelers, 1 lakh each of motorcycles and scooters. Sheel said, We will begin manufacturing 125 cc engines and would eventually like to be present in all engine sizes.

 The company will also be present in the automatic gearless scooter segment.

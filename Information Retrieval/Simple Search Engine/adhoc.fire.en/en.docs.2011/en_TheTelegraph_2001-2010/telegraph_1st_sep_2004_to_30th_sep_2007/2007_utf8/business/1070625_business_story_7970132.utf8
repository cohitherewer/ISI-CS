 Q amp;A

 Home alone

 I have taken home loans for two houses located in different places. My parents are living in one house for the last two years and I shall get possession of the other soon. Am I entitled to tax benefits on both the loans for both the houses? Can I avail of tax benefits on house rent allowance also?

 A.N. Mishra, Jamshedpur

 You cannot claim tax benefits on home loan repayments on each of those houses. You can claim tax deduction on any of the two. However, you can claim HRA benefit along with the tax deduction on housing loan provided your employer acknowledges that you have to stay in a rented place as your own house is too far from your office to commute on a regular basis. 

 Tax saving fixed deposits

 I am a senior citizen and a taxpayer. I understand that bank fixed deposits up to Rs 1 lakh for five years are exempt under section 80C of the Income Tax Act on top of the threshold limit of Rs 195,000. I want to know whether such fixed deposits are to be made with the nationalised banks only or it may be made with any scheduled commercial bank, including foreign banks operating in this country?

 S. Ghosh, Salt Lake

 Tax saving bank fixed deposits are not the regular fixed deposits having a maturity of five years or above, these are special deposits and almost all banks are offering these now. You can invest in a tax saving fixed deposit with any scheduled commercial bank, including foreign banks. 

 Interest income

 I have made two fixed deposits with Allahabad Bank and opened two more Senior Citizen Savings Scheme accounts with the SBI. Each investment is of Rs 24,000. I have no PAN and my total income from these deposits is less than the threshold limit. Is it mandatory to have a PAN for withdrawal of quarterly interest or receiving the maturity amount? Is furnishing Form 15H a must for non-deduction of TDS on interest income?

 P.K. Gayen, Sheoraphuli

 PAN is not mandatory for withdrawal of quarterly interest or receiving the maturity amount. But submitting Form 15H is a must for non-deduction of tax at source on the interest income.

 Chairman of IFCI resigns

 New Delhi, Sept. 16 (pti): N. Balasubramanian, the chairman of Industrial Finance Corporation of India Ltd (IFCI), has resigned, citing his conflicting role as an adviser to one of the bidders. The ailing industrial lender is looking for a strategic partner for stake sale.

 The development will not affect the stake sale as financial bids from interested parties were yet to be invited.

 Balasubramanian, who resigned with immediate effect before expressions of interest from 10 entities were opened yesterday, was no longer the ifci chairman, the official said.

 The board will ratify his decision, besides taking up other routine issues at its meeting on September 20. The meeting will be followed by a shareholders meeting the next day, the official added.

 Balasubramanian was adviser to the Standard Chartered Bank, one of the entities in a consortium that submitted an expression of interest. The consortium was led by wl Ross and included Standard Chartered Bank, Goldman Sachs and hdfc Ltd.

 Efforts to revive ifci moved ahead after Balasubramanian assumed charge in early August this year.

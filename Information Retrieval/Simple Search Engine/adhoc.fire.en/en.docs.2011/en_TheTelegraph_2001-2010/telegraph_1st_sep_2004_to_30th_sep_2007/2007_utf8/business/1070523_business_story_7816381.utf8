 Tatas set Jharkhand date

 Muthuraman: Focussed

 Calcutta, May 22: Tata Steel is on track to commence operations at its greenfield plant in Jharkhand by 2011, though the state government is yet to come out with a rehabilitation policy for the displaced.

 The company has already signed the MoU with the state for the 12mt project which is likely to be in Tontoposhi. 

 Tata Steel is also expanding the capacity of the Jamshedpur plant in the state to 10mt from 5mt.

 If the company gets the land by 2009, then the greenfield plant will go on stream by 2011, Partha Sengupta, principal executive officer of the Jharkhand project, said.

 The company has identified 10,000 acres for the project but is unwilling to proceed with the acquisition in the absence of the rehabilitation policy. 

 Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman said, We have taken good care of the people for the last 100 years and will continue to do so wherever we put up a new project. 

 Muthuraman and Sengupta were in the city for the launch of a book by Tata Sonss director R. Gopalakrishnan.

 The land for the project will also include the resettlement plots.

 The company had earlier announced that it wanted to rehabilitate the displaced even before embarking on its greenfield projects at Kalinga Nagar in Orissa and at Jharkhand.

 Against the backdrop of widespread resistance against land acquisition for industry, the Tatass approach can be seen as an attempt to address the possible disquiet at an early stage.

 Under the Tata Parivar scheme, the displaced would be moved to a colony having electricity, water, sewerage and other amenities. 

 Arrangements will be made for health facilities, education and vocational training.

 The rehabilitation plan will also take care of the people who will be marginally and indirectly affected by the project. The displaced will be registered and provided with an identity card.

 Independent social audits will maintain transparency of the policy and monitor the well-being of the people.

 The Tata Parivar project will also be implemented at Kalinga Nagar. 

 The objective is participation of the displaced in all phases of the project, right from construction to operations. 

 However, the plans can be implemented only if the Jharkhand government puts in place the rehabilitation policy.

 This is because the policy will provide the norms for the Tatass welfare schemes.

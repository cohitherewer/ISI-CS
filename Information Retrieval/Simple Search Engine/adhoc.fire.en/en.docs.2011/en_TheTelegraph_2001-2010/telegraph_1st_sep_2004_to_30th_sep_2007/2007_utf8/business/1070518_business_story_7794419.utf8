 Dabur Pharma posts higher net

 New Delhi, May 17 (PTI): Dabur Pharma reported a net profit of Rs 2.73 crore in the fourth quarter of 2006-07 compared with Rs 20.62 lakh a year ago. 

 A better product mix and superior cost-control strategy helped the company post a higher profit.

 Buoyed by the higher profits, the company said it would continue to pursue overseas acquisitions. 

 We are on the look out for acquisitions in the overseas market. The company is in talks with three to four players across various geographies, Ajay K. Vij, chief operating officer, Dabur Pharma, said. He, however, did not divulge any details on the acquisitions.

 The companys turnover in the fourth quarter increased 12.4 per cent to Rs 59.6 crore from Rs 53.01 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal.

 For the fiscal ended March 31, its net profit grew 36 per cent to Rs 24.25 crore from Rs 18.55 crore in the previous fiscal, while its turnover stood at Rs 322 crore against 270 crore last year, a gain of 19 per cent year-on-year.

 Our profitability has improved on account of a better product mix, which has resulted in better margins and also due to controlled expenses in some of the manufacturing processes, Vij said.

 Bullish on global demand for anti-cancer drugs, the company expects the US and European markets to fuel its future growth.

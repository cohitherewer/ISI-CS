 Low Ravva output to hit BRPL

 S.P.S. PANNU

 Drop by drop

 New Delhi, Jan. 28: The declining output of the Ravva oilfield has spelt trouble for Bongaigaon Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd (BRPL) as the company heavily depends on the high-quality sweet crude produced from these eastern offshore fields.

 The ONGC-discovered oilfield, operated by Cairn Energy in a joint venture with ONGC, supplies 1.5 million tonnes (mt) of sweet crude for processing to BRPL every year.

 Sources said with the output of the field falling, the quantity being supplied to BRPL might have to be reduced.

 The petroleum ministry has started discussions on alternative arrangements to meet any shortfall of sweet crude through imports.

 The high shipping costs in importing crude would hit the bottomline of BRPL, and the petroleum ministry is trying to work out a formula through which all the refineries in Assam can share the extra transport cost.

 The logic is that the extra 1.5 mt of crude being brought from outside the state enables the other refineries in crude-deficient Assam to operate on locally produced crude with a minimal transport cost. This advantage could be passed on to BRPL as well, a senior official said.

 The allocation of the 1.5 mt of Ravva crude is aimed at improving the finances of BRPL.

 Large investments would have to be made to improve the quality of petrol and diesel to meet Euro-II fuel specifications, which have come into effect from April 2005.

 BRPL needed to raise around Rs 500 crore as costly loans to upgrade its fuel quality to Euro II norms. This would have hit its bottomline.

 The sweet crude is easier to process and yields better quality products. 

 As a result, the high-cost investment required to upgrade the quality of petrol and diesel could be postponed. This breather enabled BRPL to consolidate its finances till it meets the Euro III norms by April 2010.

 BRPL has a 2.35-mt capacity but has been running below its full capacity as the output of crude in Assam had been falling short of its projected target. The 1.5 mt of Ravva crude forms a major portion of its throughput.

 BRPL also processes around 0.75 mt of Assam crude. However, while the diesel production from high-quality Ravva crude meets the Bharat Stage II emission norms, that from the Assam crude does not. 

 Since these norms have come into effect from April 1, 2006, the diesel obtained from Assam crude has to be sent to IOCs Guwahati and Barauni refineries for further processing.

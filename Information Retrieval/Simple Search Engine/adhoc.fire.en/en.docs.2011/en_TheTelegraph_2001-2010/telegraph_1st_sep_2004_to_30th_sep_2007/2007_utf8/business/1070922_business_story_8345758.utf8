 KS Oils plans Haldia plant

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 21: KS Oils, a Madhya Pradesh-based edible oil maker, is planning to set up a 500-tonne-per-day refinery in Haldia. 

 We are surveying the area for a suitable location for the plant. After it is identified, we will approach the state government for permission to acquire it, said Ramesh Garg, chairman of KS Oils. The project will come up in 2008-09. 

 The company is setting up five plants two in Rajasthan and three in Madhya Pradesh during the current financial year at an investment of Rs 400 crore. 

 We will need between 20 and 25 acres for the Haldia facility where we plan to make vanaspati and mustard oil, besides refining palmolein, Garg said. The plant will cater to eastern and north-eastern states, which have a big market for mustard oil. The total edible oil market in the country is estimated at Rs 60,000 crore, of which mustard oil accounts for Rs 12,000 crore. KS Oil has three plants in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. 

 Early this month, the company entered into a joint venture in Malaysia for palm plantations and manufacture of crude palm oil. We will soon acquire a 900-acre plantation to ensure a secure supply of raw materials. We are negotiating with various bodies in Indonesia and Malaysia to acquire 20,000-25,000 acres. These acquisitions will be completed during the current financial year, Garg said.

 The company also plans to go to Paraguay for soya plantation and soya oil production. Latin American countries are the largest producers of soya in the world. But most countries there, besides Paraguay, are going through political turmoil. We are assessing the edible oil industry there and looking for a suitable acquisition and/or location for setting up a manufacturing plant, Garg said. 

 KS Oils is also setting up a 35MW wind power project in Gujarat at an investment of Rs 210 crore. Being renewable energy, we will be able to sell power from our wind mills to the state electricity board at a higher price than we pay for consuming it, vice-president Ashwani Garg said. 

 We are also planning to set up a 200-mw coal based power plant in Madhya Pradesh or Chhattisgarh in the near future, Ramesh Garg added.

 The company is also in parlance with the state government of Madhya Pradesh to acquire land for jatropha plantation. We want to get into bio-diesel, Garg said. 

 In 2006-07, KS Oils posted a turn over of Rs 1088 crore and an after tax profit of Rs 57.32 crore. In 2007-08, we are targeting a revenue of Rs 1,800 crore and a profit of Rs 100 crore, Garg said.

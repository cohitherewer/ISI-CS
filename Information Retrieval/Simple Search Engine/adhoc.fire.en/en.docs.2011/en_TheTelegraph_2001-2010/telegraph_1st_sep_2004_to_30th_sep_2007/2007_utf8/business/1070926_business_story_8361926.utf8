 Lever sets October 3 date for buyback

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, Sept. 25: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) today announced that it would kickstart the process of buying back its shares from October 3.

 The companys board had cleared its first-ever buyback of shares at a meeting on July 29 and received shareholders approval on September 14.

 The company intends to buy back Rs 630 crore worth of shares at a price not exceeding Rs 230 per equity share.

 Soon after the announcement, the Hindustan Unilever stock, which has been under-performing over the past 12 months, nudged up 1.57 per cent to close at Rs 227.05 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch parent, holds 51.42 per cent in the company. 

 The company is hoping to buy back up to 25 per cent of the existing paid-up equity capital and free reserves as on December 31, 2006.

 The maximum number of shares that can be bought back cannot exceed 55.17 crore shares. There is no specific minimum number of shares that the company proposes to buy back, the company said in an announcement to the bourses.

 The stock touched a 52-week high of Rs 262.50 on September 27 last year and then hit the skids, plunging to a low of Rs 166 on March 7.

 The buyback of shares is one way that companies use to drive up their flagging stocks. Shareholders will be informed about the acceptance of the shares they tender in response to the offer within 15 days of the relevant payout date of the stock exchange. 

 These shares will be extinguished within seven days of acceptance. 

 Hindustan Unilever can keep its buyback option open till September 13 next year.

 It has the right to close that window earlier if it acquires shares worth Rs 630 crore.

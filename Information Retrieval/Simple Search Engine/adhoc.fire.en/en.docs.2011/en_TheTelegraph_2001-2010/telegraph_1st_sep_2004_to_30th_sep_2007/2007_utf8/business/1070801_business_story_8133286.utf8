 Inflation fight gets priority over growth 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 31: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expects the economic growth rate to slow down to 8.5 per cent per cent this fiscal from 9.4 per cent last year if policy-makers take steps to contain inflation below 5 per cent.

 Top North Block officials here said policy-makers were willing to accept lower growth since controlling inflation was the bigger task at hand. 

 With the political cost of rising prices evident in lost state Assembly elections there was little chance of not focussing on inflation. However, the RBI has attempted to balance industrys need for reasonably priced credit by not increasing the bank rate, the officials said.

 Inflation had increased to 4.41 per cent on July 14 compared with the week-ago figure of 4.27 per cent.

 Higher growth in the face of infrastructure constraints in key sectors such as power, ports, roads and mines has pushed up prices.

 Another factor behind inflation was the supply crunch in basic goods such as cement amid sustained demand and extra money flowing into the market. 

 Dollar inflows from foreign portfolio investors not only fuelled the bull run in the stock market but also contributed to the countrys foreign exchange kitty, which had swelled to $215 billion. 

 Foreign currency flowing into the country is monetised by the RBI, increasing the stock of the available currency. 

 The RBI consequently sucks out the money from the market, so that there are fewer rupees chasing goods and services. 

 Business chambers do not want the monetary policy to result in costlier credit for industry. 

 The government, too, does not wish to check growth trends in the manufacturing and services sector. 

 That is why the RBI has agreed to suck out money through a hike in CRR which should not impact bank rates, the officials said. 

 The central bank is expecting industrial and service sector growth to remain robust at double-digit levels. 

 However, both the RBI and North Block remain worried about farm growth and volatility in global oil prices. 

 Low US inventories, good demand from energy-hungry countries such as India and China have seen oil prices rebound in July, with prices ruling above $70 a barrel.

 Despite a good monsoon, low farm growth and shrinking acreages under wheat the staple foodgrain in many parts of the country are also a source of concern, the officials said.

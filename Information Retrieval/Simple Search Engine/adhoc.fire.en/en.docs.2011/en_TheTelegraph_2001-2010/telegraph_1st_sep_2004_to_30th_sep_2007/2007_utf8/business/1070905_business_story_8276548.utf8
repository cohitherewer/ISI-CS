 Tea meet brings little hope

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 HARD LUCK

 Calcutta, Sept. 4: The Tea Board will meet tomorrow to discuss the revival plans for 13 gardens in Bengal, well past the August 31 deadline for closed gardens to reopen or find new owners.

 The board and the commerce ministry had decided to find new owners for the closed gardens but the owners of these estates feel a host of issues remain unresolved.

 Some of them are not even aware of the exact nature of the financial package offered by the Centre for the gardens. Others feel the high cost of operations, coupled with electricity dues and surplus labour will make it difficult to find new owners.

 My garden at Surendranagar is the only one to have opened in May but I got the eligibility letter from the Tea Board only last week. I hope the financial package will be released soon so that owners like me who want to start operations in their closed gardens do not face a fund crunch, said Robin Paul, owner of Red Bank and Surendranagar Tea Estate.

 In the bail-out package, the Centre had promised a five-year moratorium on bank loans, waiver of penal interest and EPF penalties and fresh loans at a subsidised rate.

 Most owners feel that while the Centre has been very active with committees and financial packages, the state government has done little in the last few years to stop gardens from falling sick.

 Garden owners such as Pal are yet to receive anything as part of the package, and officials feel that most of them are not interested in the package altogether.

 I am still interested in buying a closed garden and taking over operations to revive it. But what concrete provisions have been taken by the state or the Centre to make the gardens an attractive proposition for investors. What about the dues, surplus labour and eroded productivity? said .P. Agarwal, chairman of Ambo Exports Ltd.

 Agarwal was earlier supposed to take over the Bharnobari estate, which has about 2,000 workers when the requirement is for 1,400.

 Moreover, owners face labour union trouble when they try to reopen their gardens. Pal was attacked by around 300 Citu workers.

 Workers are willing to resume work but such incidents discourage both existing and potential owners.

 We want to reopen our gardens as it makes business sense for us. But what about unresolved issues. Financial packages are helpful but how much do they help the bottomline of the gardens, another owner said.

 Tata Tea garden 

 The management of Tata Teas Damdim tea estate issued a lockout notice today after the manager and some staff were allegedly confined in their office by the workers for 15 hours yesterday.

 Damdim was considered a model tea estate which also offered tea tourism packages. 

 The workers had stopped unloading tea leaves at the factory because of differences with the newly appointed manager from Assam. The estate is one of the four owned by Tata Tea in Dooars.

 Growth maintains fine run

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Aug. 31: Indias gross domestic product reported a 9.3 per cent growth in the first quarter of this fiscal, at a time when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had put a leash on interest rates to avoid over-heating of the economy and check prices.

 The high growth comes on top of a 9.4 per cent rise in the gross domestic product in 2006-07, and the mandarins at North Block fear money tightening measures are not having the desired effect on the economy.

 On the growth show, finance minister P. Chidambaram said, Despite compulsions of a tight monetary policy, we will ensure that credit flow to productive sectors of the economy remains strong.

 A strong show by manufacturing and service spurred the growth in the first quarter. 

 Economists feel a strong middle class, flush with high salaries, have been splurging on gadgets, houses and other consumables, to ratchet up growth in manufacturing. 

 Chidambaram, too, said that the growth is driven by domestic consumption and investments.

 North Block officials said they expected the money tightening measures to soon impact growth rates in a bigger way. They said the growth rate in manufacturing which was at 11.9 per cent in the first quarter could come down to 9.5 per cent in the second quarter. The finance minister also indicated this possibility. I am confident India will return a growth rate of 9 per cent this year, he said.

 The RBI expected the growth rate to be a tad slower at 8.5 per cent this fiscal compared with 9.4 per cent last year. The officials said checking inflation, which had shot up to over 6.5 per cent at one stage, is the biggest task, for which they were willing to settle for lower growth.

 With the political cost of rising prices evident in lost state assembly elections there was little chance of not focussing on inflation. However the RBI has attempted to balance industrys need for reasonably priced credit by not increasing the bank rate, officials said.

 Jaiprakash buys Malvika Steel

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: Jaiprakash Associates is entering the steel sector by acquiring Malvika Steel at Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh for Rs 207 crore. 

 We will invest Rs 1,800 crore over the next 26-28 months to make it a 1-million-tonne integrated steel plant, said Manoj Gaur, executive chairman of Jaiprakash Associates. The company acquired Malvika Steel in an open auction arranged by the Debt Recovery Tribunal. 

 Jaiprakash will infuse Rs 800 crore and Rs 1,000 crore in two phases. The amount will be funded through a mix of debt and internal accruals, said Gaur. The group will also leverage a part of the $400 million raised recently through an offshore convertible bonds issue. 

 In the first phase, the capacity will be raised to 5 lakh tonnes by December 2008. By March 2010, the total capacity will be increased 10 lakh tonnes. The Jaiprakash group plans to produce long steel products used mainly in the construction sector. 

 Malvika Steel was originally promoted by the Usha Group. The Vinay Rai-owned group gave up the control of its ambitious Rs 2,800-crore project to financial institutions for a conditional credit of Rs 173 crore to complete the project in Uttar Pradesh. The Rai family not only sold a 51 per cent stake to financial institutions, led by IFCI, but also mortgaged its remaining 38 per cent to get the credit and lost its management control in the process.

 Other plans

 Jaiprakash Associates has lined up investments of Rs 18,000 crore over the next three to four years to increase capacities across segments such as power, cement, construction and steel.

 A booming economy has resulted in tremendous growth potential in various sectors and the company is gearing up to meet the high demand for infrastructure development in the country, Gaur said.

 The company has interests in power, engineering, construction and cement and a foray into the steel segment was a natural diversification, Gaur added.

 The group will invest Rs 4,000 crore by 2009 to increase its cement capacity by more than three-fold to 25 million tonnes.

 The company has a combined cement capacity of 7mt at its four plants in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. This will be increased to 25mt by setting up plants in Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh by December 2009. The expansion will be funded through internal accruals, he said.

 The group will invest Rs 12,000 crore to enhance its captive power capacity. The company has a hydro-power plant of 700mw and will be adding 1,000mw by 2010 and another 1,500mw thermal power unit, taking its total power capacity to more than 3,000mw by 2011. It has two plants in Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal and will set up another unit in Madhya Pradesh.

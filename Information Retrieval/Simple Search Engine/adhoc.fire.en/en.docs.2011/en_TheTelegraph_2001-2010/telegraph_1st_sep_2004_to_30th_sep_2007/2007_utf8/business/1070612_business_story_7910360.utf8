 Calcutta, June 11: Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company today launched Care First, a standalone health insurance product. It will introduce two more plans a family floater and a pension-linked whole life health insurance over the next six months.

 More and more life insurers are turning to health insurance to attract customers.

 Last year, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company launched Diabetes Care, a stand-alone health insurance plan. Since then, it had introduced Diabetes Care Plus, Cancer Care, Cancer Care Plus, Hospital Care, HealthAssure and HealthAssure Plus.

 However, ICICI Prudential Lifes health plans cover limited critical illnesses such as diabetes or cancer. An insured person gets back the sum assured in lump sum on detection of any of those illnesses. However, there are no maturity or death benefits under any of its health policies. 

 The Life Insurance Corporation of India is also set to unveil a standalone health plan in the next two months. Other life insurers are also working hard on their respective plans.

 The Care First plan has a death benefit if the insured person dies, his/her nominee will get the sum assured after deducting the amount for hospital expenditure reimbursement, if any. ICICI Prudential Life lacks any such provision in its health plans.

 Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance will also pay the sum assured in lump sum if the insured is detected with a critical illness.

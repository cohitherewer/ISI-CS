 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Tata: New role

 Mumbai, Feb. 16: After making his mark in the global steel industry by winning over Corus, Ratan Tata is set to join the board of Alcoa Inc, a global aluminium giant. 

 Alcoa today said Tata has been appointed a director to fill a vacancy on its board. There are now 11 directors on Alcoas board. Alcoa posted revenues of $30 billion in 2006. 

 Alcoa chairman and CEO Alain Belda said, Ratans global business acumen and his depth of knowledge about quality and customer satisfaction will make him a valuable addition to our board of directors. 

 A statement from Alcoa said under the leadership of Tata, his group has grown globally primarily through acquisitions. Most recently, Tata Steel bought Corus. 

 Tata, who serves on the international advisory boards of Mitsubishi Corporation, the American International Group and JP Morgan Chase, is also a director of Fiat S.p.A. 

 Tata is also a member of the Asia-Pacific Advisory Committee of the New York Stock Exchange. He is on the board of trustees of Cornell University and the University of Southern California. 

 The appointment comes only days after Unilever announced that Infosys chairman and chief mentor, N.R. Narayana Murthy, will be inducted as a non-executive director on its board.

 Banks queue up for funds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Credit surge

 Mumbai, Jan. 2: Banks appetite for funds continue in the new year as well. UTI Bank will raise Rs 100 crore through a debenture issue. ICICI Bank is also believed to be planning to raise a similar amount through a combination of perpetual debt and Tier II bonds. 

 Banks are raising funds mainly to feed the strong demand for credit. Last year, after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed commercial banks to raise money through hybrid debt, a host of nationalised and private sector banks used this route. These banks have also been raising deposit rates to meet credit demand. 

 With growth in advances expected to remain strong despite rising interest rates, banks are likely to look at debt issues and other means to raise funds this year. 

 UTI Bank today informed stock exchanges that it plans to raise Rs 100 crore with an option to retain oversubscription by issuing upper Tier II redeemable subordinated debentures. It said while the face value will be Rs 10 lakh per debenture, the coupon rate will be 9.50 per cent and it will be payable annually. 

 The redemption will be 15 years from the deemed date of allotment and it will not carry any put option. Only the bank will have a call option, which can be enforced after 10 years. 

 The debentures will be listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange. Subscription for the bond closes on January 20.

 Last year, UTI Bank had raised $46 million through a bond issue to various international subscribers.

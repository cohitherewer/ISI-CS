 Drill begins for Iran energiser

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, April 29: The National Security Council (NSC), headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, has asked the petroleum ministry to submit a report on Irans oil sector. This will help India draw up a strategic oil policy vis-a-vis Iran.

 The petroleum ministry was not keen on the report. The NSC, however, insisted on the report since it has implication for Indias oil security.

 Iran is the fourth largest oil exporter globally and has gas reserves as well. It is keen on ties with India and China as it is facing sanctions from the US and its allies. 

 Tehran also wants to leverage its hydrocarbon reserves to get support for its nuclear stand-off with the US.

 China has taken a stronger stand in support of Iran at the UN than India, and this has resulted in Chinese oil companies getting better deals. China also enjoys a veto power at the UN, which India lacks. The nuclear agreement between India and the US has also not gone down well with Iran.

 In one of the biggest energy deals of China, Sinopec Group has signed a $70-billion oil and natural gas agreement with Iran. Sinopec will buy 250 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas over a 30-year period from Iran and develop the Yadavaran field.

 Iran is also committed to export 150,000 barrels per day of crude to China for 25 years at market prices after the field starts producing.

 India, however, has not made much headway in acquiring oil assets in Iran. Its plans to import liquefied natural gas have hit a rough patch as Iran has raised the price of the gas and is benchmarking it with soaring crude prices.

 According to India, Iran had agreed to supply the gas at around $3 per million Btu, while Tehran holds that the agreement for the lower price does not stand as it had not been ratified.

 India, on its part, is diversifying its sources of crude supply and has ventured out to acquire exploration blocks in Africa and Latin America.

 While India is continuing talks with Tehran on the proposed Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline, the issue of settling the price of the gas still remains. All gas contracts are long-term in nature and no country can jump into a deal in a hurry.

 Geopolitics has also cast a shadow on the proposed pipeline deal as the US is strongly opposed to the project.

 In May last year, Iran had set an August 2006 deadline to finalise the proposal for the $7-billion Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline project.

 Iranian deputy oil minister Hadi Nejad Hosseinian had said after meeting petroleum minister Murli Deora that if India did not meet the deadline for the pipeline project, Iran would go ahead with exports to Pakistan. 

 But unless India joins the project, it is not profitable for Iran as Pakistan lacks the potential to absorb large quantities of gas.

 Sweet pill for sugar buffer stock

 More the merrier

 New Delhi/Calcutta, July 9: The government should scrap the monthly release mechanism for sugar and instead create a buffer stock to control the price of the commodity. This was suggested by research firm KPMG in its report Indian Sugar Industry: Sector Roadmap 2017. 

 The study also recommended an independent regulator for the industry and the removal of the sweetener from the list of essential commodities.

 Regulations influence the entire value chain, including land demarcation, sugarcane price, its procurement and production and sale of the commodity by mills in domestic and international markets, the report said.

 The government regulates the sale of sugar through a monthly release of quotas and also sources it from mills at a concessional rate for its public distribution system . 

 P. Ramababu, president of the Indian Sugar Mills Association, said, Around 61.5 per cent of free sale sugar is consumed by industrial and small business segments. So the purpose of the government is hardly served in this case. 

 Families having a monthly income of above Rs 5,000 consume around 12.8 per cent of sugar. This leaves 25.7 per cent in the lower income group and each household approximately consumes 2 to 3 kg per month.

 Speaking in favour of hiking sugar prices, Arvind Mahajan, executive director of KPMG Services, said, A 10 per cent increase in sugar price leads to less than 1 per cent increase in monthly food expenses.

 The study also suggested modifications of certain regulations. 

 It said the price of sugar and primary byproducts such as molasses and bagasse should be directly linked to the cane price. 

 There should be a minimum support price to protect farmers. The price of sugar should be region-specific. 

 The report stated that the industry could emerge as a significant source of electricity through co-generation as well as of fuel ethanol for blending with petrol.

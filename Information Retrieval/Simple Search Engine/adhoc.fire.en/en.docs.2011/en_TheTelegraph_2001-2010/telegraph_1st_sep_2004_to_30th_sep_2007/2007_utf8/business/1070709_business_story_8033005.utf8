 Ficci wary of skill shortage 

 On demand

New Delhi, July 8 (PTI): An acute shortage of skilled professionals in different sectors, including medicine, IT and aviation, may dampen the economys growth rate, industry body Ficci has warned.

 The country will have a shortage of over five lakh doctors and engineers each and thousands of pilots by 2012, according to a study by the chamber. At present, there are 5.91 lakh doctors and a maximum of 22,000 would be added to this number annually, taking the total to about seven lakh by 2012 against an estimated requirement of over 12 lakh, the survey said.

 The number of nurses is less than one lakh against a requirement of over 11 lakh by 2012. There would be a serious shortfall of anaesthetists, radiologists, gynaecologists and surgeons. The country will have to take immediate corrective steps to overcome the shortage if it wants to maintain the growth momentum of the economy, Ficci said.

 The information technology industry requires over 3.5 lakh engineers every year against the available 1.5 lakh. The total shortfall would be over five lakh by 2012.

 Aviation will require 5,400 pilots by the end of the eleventh plan. After that, 150 pilots would be required each year to balance retirement and attrition. The survey identified education, food processing and biotechnology as other areas deserving immediate attention.

 In education, there is a shortfall of 25-40 per cent. This will increase further because of an acute shortage in engineering, management, computers and communications, where only 33-75 per cent of the requirement is met.

 There is a shortage of about 80 per cent of doctorate and post-doctorate scientists in molecular biology, biochemistry, biotechnology and analytical chemistry.

 In food processing, there is a shortage of 65 per cent of refrigeration mechanics, electricians and fitters, 70 per cent in food safety and 60 per cent in agricultural science. At the same time, there is a shortage of certificate holders and persons trained in short-term courses.

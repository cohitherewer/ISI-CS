 China move to tame inflation

 Beijing, July 21 (Reuters): China raised interest rates today in the latest of a series of tightening steps aimed at keeping inflation in check and preventing the worlds fourth-largest economy from overheating.

 The increase came a day after the government reported that annual growth accelerated to 11.9 per cent in the second quarter, the fastest rate in 11and a half years, from 11.1 per cent in the first quarter.

 The Peoples Bank of China, the central bank, ordered an increase of 0.27 percentage point in commercial banks benchmark one-year deposit and lending rates.

 That will take the one-year benchmark deposit rate to 3.33 per cent from 3.06 per cent. The one-year lending rate will rise to 6.84 per cent from 6.57 per cent.

 Economists were not surprised by the increase, which takes effect on Saturday.

 Its very much in line with what the market had anticipated, said Kamal Sharma, currency strategist with Bank of America in London.

 We have had very strong Chinese data in the past few days; the surprise would have been if China did not move. Further hikes are still on the cards. In the absence of moves in the exchange rate, domestic monetary policy is the best way to curb growth.

 DLF issue subscribed 3.5 times

 Mumbai, June 14 (PTI): The initial public offering of DLF today closed with bids for about 3.5 times of the total issue size, with foreign investors showing the strongest interest in the issue.

 The issue received bids for about 60.7 crore shares, against the total issue size of 17.5 crore shares at the end of the four-day book-building process, data available with the stock exchanges showed.

 The firm saw demand worth over Rs 33,000 crore for its shares, with FIIs alone submitting bids for shares worth over Rs 25,000 crore.

 Merchant banking sources said the company was likely to list its shares on the bourses by the first week of July.

 The issue had opened for subscription on June 11 and it was fully subscribed on the second day itself.

 While the qualified institutional buyers portion of the issue received robust demand and was subscribed over five times, the retail segment could get bids for only 97.5 per cent of the shares reserved for them, the data showed.

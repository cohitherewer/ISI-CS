 Tata car not a threat to Maruti

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: Maruti will stick to its own strategy and not react to Tata Motors plans of a Rs 1-lakh car, managing director Jagdish Khattar told shareholders at the companys annual general meeting today.

 Every company has its own strategy. If we keep reacting to competitors, our own strategy will fail, he said. 

 The Tata car will be more of a threat to two-wheelers. Even foreign experts and analysts agree with us. Two-wheeler customers who cannot afford our products will be attracted to the small car, said Khattar. 

 The meeting also approved the change of the companys name to Maruti Suzuki India Limited. This will come into effect after it is approved by the Registrar of Companies. 

 Khattar said the company would launch a model every year for two consecutive years. Maruti has decided not to revise its exports target for this year. We are exporting to quite a few markets right now. We started our international operations two year ago in non-European countries, he said. I myself went to convince them and they are following Marutis way of sales now. The Zen Estilo has emerged as the market leader in Indonesia, he added.

 The company sells about 1,000-1,200 units of the Zen Estilo every month in Indonesia.

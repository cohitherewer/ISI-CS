 Alstom plans to beef up operations

 Power play

Calcutta, Feb. 8: Alstom Projects India Ltd plans to invest on expanding capacities at its turbines and generators repairing workshop in Vadodara, Gujarat. It will also manufacture parts of super-critical boilers of 800 mega watt (mw) and above at its Durgapur plant in the state. 

 Super-critical technology improves the efficiency of power generation. The technology reduces emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it lowers the use of fuel used to generate electricity. The technology is for high-capacity boilers and turbines that promotes economies of scale. 

 Power companies are keen on the super critical technology as it enables them to generate large volumes of electricity and meet environmental concerns.

 The power sector has attained a stage where 660 mw would be the critical boiler size for optimum output. Keeping this in mind, we propose to set up facilities to manufacture boilers of 800 mw and above in India in partnership with Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel), said Frederic Lalanne, vice-chairman and managing director of Alstom Projects India Ltd. 

 In 2005, Alstom entered into an agreement with Bhel to transfer super-critical boiler technology over a period of 15 years. Under the agreement, we will make parts of the boilers at our Durgapur facility, while Bhel will make some parts at its Trichy plant and it will also do the onsite assembling of these boilers, said Lalanne. 

 However, he added that investment and production at the Durgapur plant were still pending because there were no orders for super-critical boilers. 

 Alstom will, however, soon increase its turbines and generators repairing and maintenance capacity at its Vadodara workshop, said Nirmal Jha, director, power service division of the company. 

 At present, the unit can repair five turbines and two generators a day. We are looking at doubling this capacity to 10 turbines a day, he added.

 But the company didnt give any further details about its investment plans for India. Alstom Projects India has three manufacturing facilities boiler plants at Shahabad in Karnataka and in Durgapur, a steam and hydro turbine manufacturing facility and a maintenance workshop at Vadodara in Gujarat.

 The company has an order book of Rs 2,100 crore and expects a revenue of Rs 1,000 crore by the end of the current fiscal. Alstom Holding, the global parent company, recently acquired a 51 per cent stake in Chinese boiler manufacturer, Wuhan Boiler Company, for $41 million.

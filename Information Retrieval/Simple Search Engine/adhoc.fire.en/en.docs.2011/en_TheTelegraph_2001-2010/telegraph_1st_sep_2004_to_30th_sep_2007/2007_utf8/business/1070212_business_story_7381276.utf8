 Growth winds blow strong in economy

 On firm footing

 Is the Indian economy overheating? Theres no doubt that the rate of inflation is high. But notice that both the manufacturing and fuel indices didnt move in the week to January 27, the latest date for which information is available and the entire jump to 6.58 per cent was due to a rise in the index of primary articles. Usually, prices of food articles fall in the winter. For instance, the WPI index fell from 190.6 in November 2004 to 188.3 by the end of January 2005, before starting to move up again. Similarly, it fell from a high of 198.4 in November 2005 to 195.9 by the end of January 2006. This year, however, the WPI index has remained at 208.8 at end-January, only marginally down from 209.1 in November 2006. This kind of inflation is the result of constrained supply, the result of decades of neglect of agriculture, and monetary policy can do little about it.

 That said, theres no question that the WPI understates the extent of real inflation in the economy. A comparison of the nominal and real growth in consumption expenditures over the years show a very high rise in the prices of services such as health care, education and transport, which are not captured in the WPI data. Nor is the rise in housing prices reflected in the data.

 But the real concern stems from the rise in manufactured products, which is now 6.2 per cent year-on-year. At the end of January last year, the y--y rate was a mere 1.9 per cent. This rise in manufactured product prices ties in well with anecdotal evidence about Indian companies operating flat out at full capacity and with manufacturers getting back pricing power. Theres little doubt, therefore, that the economy is overheating and the RBI has to manage inflation till the time that companies are able to expand capacity and new supply comes on stream. That means were already at the top of the cycle.

 Will the downturn start soon? Unlikely, because of several reasons. One, it is by no means certain that the RBI will be able to curb money supply even if it wishes to tighten monetary policy. The latest RBI numbers show that M3 has been growing at an annual rate of 21.1 per cent as on January 19, despite all the measures the RBI took to tighten liquidity and raise interest rates. Thats because companies have so many options to access funds today from the stock markets both at home and abroad and from external commercial borrowings. Also, the RBIs efforts to keep the value of the rupee down by buying dollars release liquidity into the money markets. Next, with inflation inching up, real interest rates are still low, despite the rise in nominal interest rates. And finally, the impact on consumer demand will be offset by the rise in investment demand on the one hand and by the new initiatives taken by the government in boosting infrastructure on the other. The third quarter corporate results give no indication of any slowdown in earnings the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth in sensex earnings was 40 per cent and 12.6 per cent respectively (excluding HLL, whose results havent come in).

 The wild card, of course, is global liquidity. While its true that the Indian economy is relatively insular, at least compared to the East Asian economies, it is at the same time very dependent on foreign fund flows and on global liquidity conditions. So far, however, there are few signs of a correction, despite the worry that the fall in the value of the yen may lead to a demand for increasing interest rates in Japan by the EU, which could affect carry trades. 

 As long as global liquidity conditions remain benign, and as long as investment demand remains high, there is unlikely to be a slowdown.

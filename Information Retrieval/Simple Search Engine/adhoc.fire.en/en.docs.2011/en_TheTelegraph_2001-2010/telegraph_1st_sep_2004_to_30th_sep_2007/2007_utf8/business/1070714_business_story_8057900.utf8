 DLF close to record deal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 13: Real estate major DLF has bid Rs 1,750 crore for 112 acres belonging to DCM Shriram Consolidated Limited in west Delhi.

 If successful, the bid will be the largest land deal in monetary terms between two private parties. Besides DLF, Unitech has reportedly offered Rs 1,600 crore for the land in Shivaji Marg, near Najafgarh in west Delhi. Emaar MGF is also reportedly in the race.

 A DCM Shriram Consolidated official said the company had yet to decide on the winning bid. Sources said since the DLF bid was the highest, it could bag the deal.

 DLF will be able to develop only 37 acres of the 112 acres, which was the site of Swatantra Bharat Mills. This is because the Supreme Court had ruled that a company could develop only 33 per cent of a piece of land and must keep the rest for open area development and greenery. 

 The bid tops Unitechs purchase of 340 acres in a Noida Authority auction for Rs 1,583 crore in May 2006. The reserve price was around Rs 788 crore.

 In valuation terms, however, most of the realty deals in Mumbai transacted over the past two years had been more expensive. For example, Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries acquired 7.5 hectares (or 18.53 acres) in the Bandra-Kurla area for Rs 1,104 crore, making it one of the costliest land deals in the country valued at Rs 59.57 crore per acre.

 In comparison, the present DLF deal works out to just Rs 15.6 crore per acre. In fact, DLF paid more for the 17-acre plot owned by Mumbai Textile Mills that it bought two years ago for Rs 702 crore, valuing the deal at Rs 41.3 crore per acre. Analysts expect the DLF deal in west Delhi to boost realty rates in the area. 

 Apart from DLF, Parsvnath is the only other major builder in the area. Parsvnath is building a high-end apartment complex at Shivaji Garden. 

 The area is near the Shivaji Place district centre, which has four malls, with plans for seven more along with a five-star hotel and a habitat centre.

 DCM Shriram Consolidated said in a statement that it continued to actively consider and pursue various options for its property at Shivaji Marg along with its joint venture partner. 

 DLF is likely to invest about Rs 1,250 crore on expanding its multiplex business, DT Cinema, by adding about 500 screens in the next four to five years.

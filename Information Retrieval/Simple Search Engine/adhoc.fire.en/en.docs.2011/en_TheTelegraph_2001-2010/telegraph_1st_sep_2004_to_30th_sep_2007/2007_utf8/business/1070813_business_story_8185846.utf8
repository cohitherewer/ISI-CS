 Indian stocks will surge after short-term hiccup

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Mumbai, Aug. 12: Stock market travails are likely to persist, but the situation can improve in the long term with the easing of rates by the US Federal Reserve and the growing evidence of Asian markets disassociating themselves from Wall Street. 

 In its recent report called Greed amp; Fear, CLSA said bad news would not be restricted to the entities getting sucked into the US sub-prime mortgage vortex. 

 The brokerage expects a correction in commodity prices soon because of the economic weakness stemming from distressed credit markets. The global prices of some commodities weakened last week.

 Moreover, financial problems in the US will extend from securitised mortgages to the leveraged loan market where banks have underwritten $300 billion by way of loans to finance private equity deals. This means many private equity firms will not get cheap credit.

 The US financial sector will pay for its massive abuse of securitisation trading. Its overseas clients, who bought structured finance products for a dubious search for yield, will also be affected. CLSA expects the correction in Asia to continue as long as the growth scare persists in the US. However, there is a silver lining.

 In the longer term, it all spells to a massive buying opportunity for Asia. Asia and emerging market asset prices are likely to be the beneficiaries of the next bubble stemming from the coming Fed easing of rates, Christopher Wood of the brokerage said. 

 According to CLSAs report, the American markets are in a bear grip where the acute point of vulnerability is the financial services sector. 

 This means that Asia will have to decouple from Wall Street. Fortunately, there is a growing incremental evidence of such a decoupling, it added. 

 CLSA has recommended a higher weightage for India than other Asian markets. It is giving a weight of 10 per cent to India against the 9.8 per cent given by Morgan Stanley in its index for Asian stocks.

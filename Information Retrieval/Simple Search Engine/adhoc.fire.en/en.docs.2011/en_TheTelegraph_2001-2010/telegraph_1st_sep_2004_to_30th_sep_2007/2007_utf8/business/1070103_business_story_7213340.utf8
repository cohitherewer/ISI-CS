 New Delhi, Jan. 2: Faced with opposition from operators, telecom regulator Trai today appeared hesitant in revising the ceiling on roaming charges.

 It said it may enforce a regulation only after exploring all options.

 Since the operators have expressed a point of view, we would consider that and come up with a resolution which is acceptable to all, Nripendra Misra, chairman, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), said here today.

 There may be a counter-point of view, which could also be shown to them... we must try to discuss all aspects before a regulation comes into the picture... the regulation should be the last resort, not the first, Misra added. 

 Trai held an open forum today to ascertain the views of stakeholders to its proposal on fixing separate usage-based composite ceiling on tariffs for national roaming services in respect of outgoing local and inter-circle calls and incoming calls.

 Misra said Trai would again discuss the proposal with the Cellular Operators Association of India (Coai) which represents the interests of GSM companies and Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers Association of India (Auspi), which represents the CDMA companies. He said its recommendations would be placed by the end of this month.

 Eveready suffers loss

 Plans to raise annual capacity to 2.4bn batteries

 Net sales grew to Rs 190.1 crore from Rs 184.03 crore last fiscal

Calcutta, Jan. 29: Eveready Industries India Ltd (EIIL) has suffered a net loss of Rs 14.03 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 compared with a profit of Rs 6.43 crore in the same quarter last fiscal. The companys profit was hit by rising input costs and reduced margins. 

 The operating margins for batteries and flashlights came under pressure in the past 24 months with a massive jump in zinc prices to $4,405 per tonne in December 2006 from $2,417 per tonne at the beginning of the fiscal. Zinc comprises almost 50 per cent of the manufacturing cost of batteries now.

 The company had to take aggressive pricing moves, varying from 20 per cent to 50 per cent hikes for different types. While this did not seem to affect consumers initially, consumption started slowing as the price rise continued, the company reported.

 The industry as a whole suffered because of this price hike. The decline in consumption was most evident in the D-segment batteries, with growth sliding by 16 per cent. This was, however, compensated by a 9 per cent and 39 per cent growth in AA and AAA segments respectively

 EIILs market share remained unaltered at 45.4 per cent. The companys net sales grew to Rs 190.16 crore from Rs 184.03 crore last fiscal 

 Total operating cost was up 99.8 per cent of net sales during the third quarter of this fiscal from 85.7 per cent in the year-ago period. The flashlight segment, hit by reduced volumes, dipped 31 per cent. However, the decline in volumes is expected to be temporary.

 EIIL has lined up expansion plans to up the annual capacity of 1.6 billion batteries to 2.4 billion batteries. The Uttaranchal plant, with a capacity of 400 million, will begin operations from April 2007.

 EIIL has also signed an MoU with a Korean company to set up its battery manufacturing unit in India. It will produce batteries in excess of 400 million. Locations are being scouted at tax-free zones in Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal to set up the plant in the next 18 months.

 Zincs spot price on the London Metal Exchange is hovering around $3,700 per tonne. EIILs current pricing plan covers zinc at $4100 per tonne with a target of normal EBITDA margins at 14 per cent of net sales. So, if zinc prices do not go up significantly, the target could be achieved easily.

 McNally Bharat net

 McNally Bharat Engineering Companys third-quarter net sales jumped to Rs 112.57 crore from Rs 83.16 crore last fiscal. Net profit rose to Rs 3.83 crore this quarter from Rs 1.50 crore in the year-ago period.

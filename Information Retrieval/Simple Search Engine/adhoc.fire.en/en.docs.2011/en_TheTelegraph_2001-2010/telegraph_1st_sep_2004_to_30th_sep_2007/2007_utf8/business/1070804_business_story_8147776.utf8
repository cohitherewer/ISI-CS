 New Amul milk brand to enliven the cuppa 

 KAKOLY CHATTERJEE

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: Amul will launch its T-Special Milk in Calcutta tomorrow.

 This variety has been prepared solely for making tea. The company is initially targeting around 20,000 tea stalls in the city.

 R.S. Sodhi, chief general manager of Amul, said, The T-Special Milk has more milk solids to make the tea thick but has just 2 per cent of fat. This variety will, therefore, be welcomed by people who are weight conscious.

 A tea stall generally prepares around 500 cups daily with 10 litres of ordinary milk. Sodhi said, one litre of the new variety would help make 20 per cent more tea than a litre of ordinary milk.

 Amuls researchers estimate that 1 crore cups are consumed everyday in Calcutta by people who drink tea when out of home. 

 In the first two weeks, Amul plans to sell 70,000 litres of the special milk a day. After six months, the sale is expected to go up to 1 lakh litres. Prashant Tripathi, manager, milk marketing, Calcutta, said, Along with tea vendors, we expect individual homes to also take to the T-Special Milk. He added, We are expecting a 20:80 split in consumption at home and out of it.

 Priced at Rs 18 a litre, the T-Special Milk will be available in packs of 500ml and 1 litre. 

 Calcutta consumes around 8 lakh litres of packed milk everyday. Around 60 to 70 per cent of milk bought for domestic consumption is used in tea. Amul is the largest player in the Calcuttas packed milk market with daily sales of 2.6 lakh litres.

 Raju: Taking stock

 Mumbai/Hyderabad, Jan. 19: Breaking the trend in financial figures set by India Inc so far, Satyam Computer Services today fell behind street estimates when it posted a 25 per cent rise in net profit for the third quarter ended December 31, 2006. 

 Satyam also scaled down its full-year revenue outlook from earlier forecasts, sending its shares tumbling on the bourses. 

 Satyam has recorded a consolidated net profit of Rs 337.23 crore, which fell below analysts estimates of a profit figure of at least Rs 340 crore. Moreover, the company revised downwards the revenue guidance for the year ending March 31, 2007. 

 It expects revenues for 2006-07 to be in the range of Rs 6,434 crore to Rs 6,442 crore against the earlier estimate of Rs 6,452 crore to Rs 6,476 crore. The annual growth rate in the topline was, therefore, cut from 34.6-35.1 per cent to 34.3-34.4 per cent. 

 The senior management of Satyam Computers led by chairman B. Ramalinga Raju said the cut was only in terms of Indian GAAP numbers and was necessary due to rupee appreciation.

 The stock markets, however, snubbed the companys scrip for the inadequate show. 

 On the BSE, the share ended lower by 5.30 per cent or Rs 27.30 at Rs 487.90. The share had plunged to an intra-day low of Rs 476.00, a fall of 7.60 per cent over its previous finish. 

 Raju said Satyam is planning to buy out the investors stake of 25 per cent in its BPO arm, Nipuna Services, by May 21, 2007. 

 The enterprise valuation of the investors stake was around $140 million-$180 million, he added. 

 Nipunas revenues had grown 85 per cent and clocked $37 million in the third quarter and it is expected to plough in cash profits during the current quarter, he said. Raju pointed out that the companys operating margins had improved by 205 basis points. The exchange rates, strong rupee position did not move in our favour, he explained.

 Analysts also remain optimistic about the prospects of the sector as a whole for the quarter. 

 Satyam said revenues from software services stood at Rs 1,661.12 crore, up 31.3 per cent over the same period last year and 3.70 per cent sequentially. During the quarter, Satyam added 34 customers, including an international retail company and a Canada-based global bank.

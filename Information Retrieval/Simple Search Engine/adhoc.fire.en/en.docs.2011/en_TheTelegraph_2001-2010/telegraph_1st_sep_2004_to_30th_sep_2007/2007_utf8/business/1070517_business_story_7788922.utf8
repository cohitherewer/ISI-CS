 Formula for rump stake sale 

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, May 16: The government plans to sell its residual stakes in companies such as VSNL and Balco to the owners at market prices.

 The cabinet is likely to approve the proposal.

 The plan is to set up a committee of secretaries which will discuss with the owners on the necessity to sell the shares at a fair market value.

 If the owners do not agree to the proposal, the government may sell the shares in the open market.

 The government had transferred the majority stakes in some PSUs to private parties. The call option in the sale agreements gave the new owners the right to buy the governments residual stake at fixed prices after a certain period of time.

 However, the attorney-general Milon Banerjee has ruled that the companies act does not recognise the option.

 The government set up a group of ministers following the attorney generals advice against the sale at prices lower than the market price.

 The attorney general had proposed three options: the government can hold on to these shares; sell them in the open market; or sell them to the new owners at fair market prices.

 The group of ministers under Pranab Mukherjee seems to have gone for the third option. There were apprehensions over the other options as they would have led to long-drawn arbitration proceedings.

 The spotlight will be on VSNL and Balco. The government will offer to sell its 26 per cent in VSNL to the Tatas and 49 per cent in Balco to Sterlite at market prices.

 The two selloffs could alone fetch the government about Rs 5,000 crore to Rs 5,500 crore.

 The fair market value for VSNL is an average of its share prices over a specific period. The fair value for the unlisted Balco will be based on valuation reports by assessors.

 Government officials said many of the 11 PSUs and 19 hotels sold to private parties through strategic sales had call and put options in their agreements.

 The government can expect a tidy sum if the residual stakes in these companies are also sold at fair market value prices. 

 The call option has been exercised in Hindustan Zinc. Sterlite had picked up another 26 per cent in the company for Rs 446 crore a few years back.

 Strategic sales have been undertaken for 51 per cent in CMC, 74 per cent in Hindustan Teleprinters and Paradeep Phosphates.

 Infy in BPO deal with Philips 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Reaching out

 Mumbai, July 25: Infosys Technologies today entered into a $250-million outsourcing contract with Royal Philips Electronics even as it bought the Dutch companys back office centres in India, Poland and Thailand for $28 million.

 As part of the outsourcing contract, Infosys BPO will provide finance and accounting services and process the purchase orders. According to Infosys, the contract is among the largest finance and accounting BPO engagements from India and will expand the companys global network, particularly strengthening its European operations.

 Infosys will also acquire three shared service centres located in India, Poland and Thailand from Philips for which it has made an upfront payment of $28 million. 

 Infosys, which at one stage was thought to be pursuing Capgemini, said the deal would extend its global network through the new centres. Moreover, it will gain around 1,400 Philips professionals who will add to the Infosys BPO team a wide range of skills and abilities, which include diverse language capabilities, technical expertise and domain knowledge.

 Infosys CEO S. Gopalakrishnan told reporters in Bangalore today that the multi-million outsourcing contract with Philips was spread over a seven-year period and revenues from the deal would start accruing from October. 

 Acquisition of the three centres is also expected to be completed in the same month.

 The acquisition of these centres comes at a time when an appreciating rupee has hit margins in the BPO business. 

 After declaring the first quarter results recently, senior Infosys executives had said for every 1 per cent rise in the value of the Indian currency, margins in the BPO business would be affected by 85 basis points. Analysts added that at such times, acquisitions would be one way to grow.

 Amitabh Chaudhry, CEO of Infosys BPO, had said that the company would look out for markets where it could source people or those locations where costs were lower. 

 On the BPO side, Infosys has made a beginning in Manila and it also has a presence in China. Gopalakrishnan had earlier indicated that the company would look at captive BPOs for integration of its business. 

 The acquisition came on a day when global rating agency, Standard amp; Poors revised its outlook on the corporate credit rating of Infosys.

 Roy: New role

 Calcutta, July 2: Roopen Roy, the former managing director of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and three other top managers at the firm have joined Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India Pvt Ltd, the global consultancy.

 Deloitte today announced the appointment of the four new partners who will manage and consolidate its consulting services in India. The firm intends to double the revenues of its Indian operations to Rs 1,000 crore by 2010.

 Roy will join as the managing director effective October 1. The other three partners are Joydeep Datta Gupta, Jaideep Ganguli and Arindam Guha.

 Roy will also be part of the global consulting team. He headed PwCs managing consulting practice until it was divested to IBM in October 2002.

 Joydeep Datta Gupta was earlier head of the business solutions practice at PwC in India. Jaideep Ganguli has 20 years of experience in technology implementation, IT value management and governance. Arindam Guha specialises in strategy and business process consulting.

 We are aiming for a revenue of Rs 1,000 crore from the Indian operations by the end of the decade, Deloittes global managing partner (operations) Manoj Singh told reporters in Mumbai while announcing the launch of a new company Deloitte and Touche Consulting India Pvt Ltd.

 Deloittes revenues from the Indian operations in the last financial year ended May was around Rs 500 crore.

 The new company floated today will consolidate Deloittes consulting services in India, as part of its growth strategy to meet the needs and challenges of the growing Indian market.

 These appointments are part of our strategy to expand Deloittes presence in India beyond the current 8,000 people, in response to the tremendous growth in the market, Singh said. 

 Talking about Deloitte and Touche Consulting India, Singh said: Our consulting practice will enable us to serve not only the needs of Indian clients looking to expand operations... but also multinationals seeking the development of market entry strategies and offshoring in India.

 Deloitte is among the four big firms that didnt divest its consulting business and we are the only firm providing a full suite of services, Roy said.

 Deloitte has 100 partners in India and its current strength is double of its nearest competitor, Singh said.

 The consulting business in India is likely to grow by 35 per cent against the global growth rate of 12 to 15 per cent, Singh added.

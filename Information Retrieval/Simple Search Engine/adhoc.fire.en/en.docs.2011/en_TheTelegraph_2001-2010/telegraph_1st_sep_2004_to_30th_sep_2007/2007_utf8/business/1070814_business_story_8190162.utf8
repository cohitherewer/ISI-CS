 New Delhi, Aug. 13: IFCI today invited expressions of interest from financial institutions and consortiums for its 26 per cent stake sale.

 Financial institutions and consortiums with a net worth of Rs 4,000 crore or with assets worth Rs 10,000 crore under their management or having an asset base of Rs 10,000 crore can place their bids.

 IFCI will float fresh equity equal to the 26 per cent stake in favour of the successful bidder in January. The buyer will then have to make an open offer to pick up at least 20 per cent equity from the market.

 Officials said they expected the sale to fetch about Rs 600-800 crore. The buyer will also have to spend almost an equal amount on the open offer.

 If a consortium buys the stake, the lead investor should have at least 26 per cent interest in the consortium. 

 We expect several foreign banks and institutions to take a keen interest in this offer. Barclays and Citicorp may also be among the bidders, said IFCI executives. However, the banks did not confirm this.

 IFCI, which has about Rs 6,500 crore of bad assets on its books, holds about Rs 12,300 crore of quoted stock and Rs 12,600 crore of unquoted stock. Significant holdings include the NSE, Tourism Finance Corporation of India, Stock Holding Corporation, Power Trading Corporation and GIC Housing Finance Ltd.

 IFCI has a diversified ownership base. Foreign institutional investors hold about 21.8 per cent, insurance companies about 14.2 per cent, banks and domestic financial institutions about 10.5 per cent and public at large 37.1 per cent.

 There is no direct government holding in the company but state-run FIs and banks have a significant stake. Therefore, we enjoy strong government backing, said officials. This will, however, end once the company is sold off. 

 Officials said bidders would have to send in expressions of interest by September 14. Detailed bids will have to be completed by November.

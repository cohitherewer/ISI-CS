 Indians executive class price knockoff fails to ruffle rivals

 ANIRUDH LASKAR

 Mumbai, May 2: Back on March 21, state-owned airline Indian dangled a delicious bait to its economy passengers: pay just Rs 100 and upgrade to the executive class.

 A flurry of ads followed in newspapers but they didnt say anything about the catch in the fine print: for starters, it was available only on 70 routes across the country and didnt cover the metro-linking routes. Second, it was targeted only at full-fare economy passengers. 

 At a time when dynamic fares had changed the face of aviation and very few passengers paid full economy fares if at all, there were always bound to be some questions about the commercial success of the scheme, which runs till September 30.

 But perhaps you could flip around the question: instead of economy class passengers bumping up to executive class, could people who normally travel club class take this as an opportunity to fork out less and travel in style? It certainly would knock 25 to 30 per cent off the executive class fare on the 70 sectors.

 Jet Airways has been the front-runner in club-class travel with Kingfisher starting to provide some stiff competition. Indian was betting that the scheme would help it pack its empty executive class seats on these flights and perhaps wean away passengers from the competition.

 How good is the Indian offer really? Take an example of a flight between Delhi and Bangalore. An executive class ticket on Jet Airways is priced at Rs 22,600 on this route. The same ticket under the Indian scheme would cost only about Rs 15,000 on Indian, which is a saving of Rs 7,600.

 Indian is obviously excited about its scheme though they are reluctant to give out the figures. Indian has witnessed a nearly 30 per cent growth in executive class travel in the first three weeks, and we expect the figures to go up with time, an official at Indian told The Telegraph.

 So, how serious is the threat to other domestic carriers? Not many see any reason why Jet or Kingfisher should start to worry.

 Although the scheme has been launched with an attempt to lure business into its executive class, it will not have a significant impact and will not help Indian gain much market share. Business class products in Indian are weak when compared with that of Jet and Kingfisher, said C. Venkateswara Prasad, president of the Travel Agents Association of India.

 The competition isnt running scared either. Such offers may convey a wrong impression among the passengers. They may feel that there is no difference between the economy class and the executive class. Jet doesnt see any impact or threat to its business from the Indian offer, said Gaurang Shetty, vice-president (marketing) at Jet Airways.

 A dipstick survey of travel agents in Mumbai indicated that there was there was growing interest in Kingfishers first class travel with some reckoning that Vijay Mallyas flamboyant airline could pull ahead of the pack in the next four to five years.

 Our desire is to innovate and woo the guest. Our promotional campaigns are focused on offering our guests something that no one else can offer, said an official spokesperson at Kingfisher Airlines Ltd.

 The scheme will help Indian give the other newbie Paramount Airways a run for its money on the short-haul flights in the south. Paramount has only executive class in its Embraer aircraft and its aggressive pricing has enabled it to carve out a niche in the aviation business.

 Let us consider another example of a common route where both Paramount and Indian would be flying; a Hyderabad-Chennai flight in the Executive Class would cost nearly Rs. 10,524 on Paramount Airways. The same ticket on Indian would cost Rs 7,095 under this scheme.

 Commenting on the Indian offer, M. Thiagarajan, managing director of Paramount Airways, said, It is heartening to note that other airlines in India have started to emulate the highly successful business model launched by Paramount Airways.

 Officials at Indian remain gung-ho about the scheme. Contrary to the opinion of some travel agents, we believe we have done a lot to promote the scheme. The increased occupancy in Indians business class bears testimony to that fact. The executive class in Indian has a loyal following among the frequent fliers and corporate travellers. It offers a host of unique benefits that none of the other domestic providers offer, a senior official from Indian told The Telegraph. 

 The debate rages on: five months down the line, we will know how successful the scheme really was.

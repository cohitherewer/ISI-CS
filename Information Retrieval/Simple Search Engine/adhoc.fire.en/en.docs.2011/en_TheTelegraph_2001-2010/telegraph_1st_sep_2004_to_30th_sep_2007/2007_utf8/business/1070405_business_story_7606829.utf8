 Daimler breaks Chrysler silence

 Parting ways

 Berlin, April 4 (Reuters): DaimlerChrysler confirmed on Wednesday it is in talks with prospective buyers for its loss-making US arm Chrysler, but the worlds fifth-biggest carmaker said it was keeping all options open.

 I can confirm that we are talking with some of the potential partners who have shown a clear interest, chief executive Dieter Zetsche said in remarks prepared for delivery to the groups annual meeting.

 But it is also true that we need to keep all options open, and that I cannot disclose any details, because we need to have the maximum scope for manoeuvre, Zetsche added.

 DaimlerChrysler shares were up 0.9 per cent at 62.60 euros by 0709 GMT when the main Frankfurt market index was up 0.4 per cent.

 The company did not name any parties who have expressed an interest in Chrysler since the company first said in mid-February it was examining all options for the US business.

 But the Detroit News said on Wednesday that private equity groups Cerberus Capital Management and the Blackstone Group have submitted the formal offers and Canadian car parts group Magna International Inc has also made an offer, citing people close to the situation.

 DaimlerChrysler is expected to choose one bidder as an exclusive negotiating partner by the end of April, it said.

 Stronger Pak flavour in tea exports

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Jan. 1: The commerce ministry is eyeing the huge Pakistani market to give a fillip to Indias tea exports. 

 Minister of state for commerce Jairam Ramesh told The Telegraph that a fresh round of talks would be held with Pakistan, as the two countries have become friendlier after external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjees recent visit to Islamabad. 

 Ramesh said he had taken up the issue with the Pakistani commerce minister in Dhaka in April last year, but the move had run aground with the serial blasts in Mumbai souring relations between the two countries. 

 While Pakistan is the second largest consumer of tea in the world, India is the largest producer. It makes a lot of sense for the two countries to trade in the commodity, the minister said.

 We will ask Pakistan to open the Wagah border for Indian tea exports, he added. Pakistan has a market of 140 million kg of tea, of which Indias share was a meagre 8 million kg until 2004-05. Things were better last year with Indian tea exports to the country doubling to 16 million kg, and we would like to build on this improved scenario, Ramesh said.

 Most of the tea exports to Pakistan have been through the circuitous Dubai route. If the land border is opened, both the countries can reap huge benefits, as transport cost would come down.

 Ramesh said as part of the wider strategy to boost tea exports, marketing efforts would be stepped up to retain the countrys traditional markets, including Russia, Iraq, the UK and UAE, and at the same time tap new markets such as Pakistan, Iran and Egypt.

 A tea marketing centre is being set up in Cairo through public-private partnership and this will help boost exports both to Egypt and its neighbouring countries. 

 Plans are also being finalised to host an India international tea festival to popularise the product. The first such festival will be held in November this year in Guwahati.

 Ramesh said the replanting drive to replace old bushes in tea gardens would go together with a strong marketing strategy, so that tea growers get a better price for their produce.

 Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Kenya have emerged as formidable competitors to Indian tea and the country has to gear up to meet this challenge. In fact, Indian tea exports shot up during 2006 only because Kenyas crop was hit by a severe drought.

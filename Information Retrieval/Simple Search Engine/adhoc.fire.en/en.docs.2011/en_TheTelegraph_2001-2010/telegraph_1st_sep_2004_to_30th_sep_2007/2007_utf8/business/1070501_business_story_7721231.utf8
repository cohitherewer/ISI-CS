 Mumbai, April 30: Reliance Communications (R-Com) is weighing options to unlock value in its tower business Reliance Telecommunications Infrastructure (RTIL) for shareholders. On the menu are strategic partnerships, a public issue or selloffs to private equity investors. 

 RTIL is not the only subsidiary where R-Com is planning such a move. It is launching a global issue for its international communications subsidiary FLAG Telecom, which will be listed on the London Stock Exchange. 

 Both the initiatives are expected to be completed in the next six months and will generate huge value for R-Com shareholders. 

 Speaking to reporters after announcing the fourth-quarter results of R-Com, chairman Anil Ambani said RTIL would add 20,000 towers during the current fiscal to its 12,000 now. 

 Ambani said as RTIL was a zero-debt company with a net worth of over Rs 3,000 crore, it can even raise debt of around Rs 2,000 crore. 

 According to Ambani, the company is keen on having a pan-India presence in GSM services, but is waiting for spectrum allocation from the government. If the necessary spectrum is allotted, R-Com can expand to all parts of the country within a year. The investment could be around Rs 4,500 crore. 

 R-Com has outlined a capital expenditure programme of Rs 10,000 crore in the current year, up from Rs 6,700 crore last year. This amount will mostly be spent on wireless, enterprise and other businesses. The company is also planning to unveil its direct-to- home and IPTV services during the year. 

 R-Com has posted a net profit of Rs 686.75 crore for the quarter ended March 31. Total income stood at Rs 3,141.20 crore during the period. For the full year of 2006-07, net profit jumped 612 per cent to Rs 3,163 crore from Rs 444 crore in the previous year. 

 The company declared a dividend of 10 per cent, thereby becoming the first Indian telecom firm to reward shareholders through a payout. Revenues from wireless business increased 46 per cent to Rs 10,728 crore from Rs 7,364 crore. 

 The other businesses also showed a growth. 

 Commenting on the results, Anil Ambani, said ``we are delighted at the many firsts and record achievements at Reliance Communications, in the first year of our listing. We have created more than Rs 60,000 crore of wealth for our 2 million shareholders, in the very first year... We look forward to another record year in 2007-08, and will endeavour to accelerate our momentum of customer acquisitions, increase our share of the growing market, and further enhance profitability to maximise overall shareholder value.

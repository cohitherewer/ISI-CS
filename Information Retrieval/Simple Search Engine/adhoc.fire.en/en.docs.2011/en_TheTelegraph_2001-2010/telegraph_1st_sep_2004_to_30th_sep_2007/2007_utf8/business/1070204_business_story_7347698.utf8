 Google bosses get richer

 Pocket-friendly

 San Francisco, Feb. 3 (Reuters): Google Inc said on Friday its board has agreed to pay executive officers a bonus of up to $1.5 million in total for 2006, but it was not clear if the plan applied to the billionaires who started the Web search leader.

 Co-founders and presidents Sergey Brin and Larry Page and chief executive Eric Schmidt received salaries of $1 each in 2005. 

 They were not included in a separate 2006 plan for executive bonuses of up to $3 million each filed with federal regulators in October.

 The company said on Friday in a regulatory filing that a committee would determine how to allocate the bonus, which are in addition to payments in the plan from October.

 In 2005, four Google senior vice-presidents received bonuses ranging from about $636,000 to nearly $838,000 according to a recent proxy statement.

 Schmidt and Page received bonuses of $1,630 while Brin earned a bonus of $1,723, and all three received further compensation, chiefly tied to use of chartered aircraft in 2005.

 During 2006, Google stock gained about 11 per cent, slightly ahead of a 10 per cent rise in the Nasdaq exchange.

 Earlier this week, Google said quarterly profit nearly tripled, helped by a lower tax rate and expense controls, and that revenue jumped 67 per cent to $3.21 billion.

 Revenue growth is closely watched as investors gauge Googles ability to capitalise on Web advertising against rivals such as Yahoo Inc and Microsoft Corp.

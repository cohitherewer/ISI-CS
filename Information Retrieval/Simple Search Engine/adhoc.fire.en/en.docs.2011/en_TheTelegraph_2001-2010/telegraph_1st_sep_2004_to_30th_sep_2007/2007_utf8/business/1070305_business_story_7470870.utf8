The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Time for markets to take a breather

 What a week it has been! What started off as rumours of a local clampdown on the Shanghai stock exchange sparked off a wave of selling in asset markets across the world. 

 Strategic Forecasting Inc, a leading US security consultant and intelligence agency, says the Shanghai crash had been engineered by the Chinese authorities, who wanted to cool off overheated markets. It is not at all clear, however, why a crash in a market closed to foreigners should spread around the globe so rapidly. The more plausible reason is that all markets have run up too far too fast and its time to take a breather.

 The surprise was actually in the reaction of the US stocks, which had their worst crash since 9/11. There has been mixed economic data coming out of the US, but the crash shows that there are deep underlying fears about the economy slipping into a recession, a fear stoked by former Fed chairman Alan Greenspans bearish comments.

 Back home, the sensex was already down about 8 per cent or so before the global selloff and the budget pushed it down further.

 Is the crash similar to the one that occurred last May? Hong Kong-based research outfit Gavekal points out that the two incidents are very different. Last May, the fears were that the Fed would hike interest rates because of rising inflation; this time, the worry is slowing US growth. Thats why US bonds, which are sensitive to inflation, sold off last May but have gained sharply this time.

 The lower US bond yields are a pointer to the positive thing about the current crash, which is that the US Fed is not going to sit on its hands and let the economy slide into a recession. Its going to cut interest rates, which will unleash liquidity once again. Also, real interest rates continue to be very low, which is an indication that the outlook for growth is not so sombre. Thats true of China as well, and Hong Kong securities firm Nomura International points out Chinese real interest rates are close to zero.

 That view is echoed by global independent investment research firm BCA Research which says in its report a healthy global economy provides a firm foundation under asset prices: economic growth is broad-based, corporate balance sheets are robust and inflation and interest rates are low. 

 Moreover, the rally yesterday in bond prices is reassuring, as lower yields will help stabilise the global economy and the US housing sector. Concerns about US growth and the mortgage loan market will linger in the near run, but we think the odds of a hard-landing in the US are slim. 

 Bottom line: while near-term turbulence could persist, global equity prices should end the year higher and the rise in high-yield credit spreads will be moderate.

 That said, there will certainly be some short-term pain. The carry trades, where speculators borrow in currencies that have low interest rates to invest in high-yielding assets, are being unwound. 

 Since interest rates in Japan are very low, much of the carry trade has originated in borrowing yen. Now that these trades are being reversed, the yen has appreciated sharply. Recall that in 1998, it was a sudden sharp appreciation in the value of the yen that triggered off the global shock that led to the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund managed by Nobel Laureates. It will pay, accordingly, to keep a wary eye on the yen.

 But even BCA Research feels that the downside is building up for Indian equities. Even if global markets recover, the very high PE of the Indian market offers very little valuation cushion to protect against deteriorating monetary conditions and slowing growth.

 Sensex starts new year with a bang

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, Jan. 2: The capital market began 2007 on a promising note despite apprehensions about stretched valuations and a rising interest rate regime. Driven by automobile shares, the sensex surged 155 points in its first trading session of the year to close at 13942.24.

 Market observers feel foreign institutional investors (FIIs) will continue to buy stocks in the current year as well. In the last calendar year, FIIs made purchases worth $8 billion, down from $10.7 billion in 2005.

 It is felt that the India growth story will continue to attract both foreign and domestic investors in equities. Allocations from FIIs to markets like India will remain robust, a market analyst said.

 FIIs, who seem to have taken a break during the past few days because of Christmas and New Year holidays, are believed to have made some purchases today. This followed a rally in other Asian markets.

 The sensex opened firm at 13827.77 against its previous close of 13786.91 and after hitting a high of 13980.54, closed at 13942.24, registering a gain of 155.33 points or 1.13 per cent.

 The nifty also shot up by 41.00 points or 1.03 per cent to close at 4007.40. 

 The BSE auto index rose by 177.54 points or 3.22 per cent to close at 5,518.50 after these companies announced positive sales figures for December 2006. While shares of Bajaj Auto rose 4.6 per cent to Rs 2,738.75 after it announced a 24 per cent sales growth, Hero Honda too gained around 3 per cent. Shares of Maruti rose by Rs 41.90 to Rs 969.25 and Tata Motors ended higher at Rs 929.90.

 Other heavyweights like Reliance, Infosys, Larsen amp; Toubro, ONGC, ICICI Bank and the State Bank of India were also gainers.

 Brokers feel there are various positive triggers that bode well for equities. While India Inc will announce its third-quarter earnings shortly, finance minister P. Chidambaram will present the Union budget in February. The expectation is that Chidambaram may bring down tax levels for the corporate sector and also reduce excise duties on certain industries.

 Analysts feel some industries may be in a position to push through price increases on account of a good demand. Cement, metals and paper could see price hikes, they said. 

 However, there are many who are advising caution. Equities are quoting at higher levels. Moreover, good corporate earnings have been discounted by the market. Therefore, there will not be any spectacular rise in equity values this year, an analyst from a local brokerage warned.

 Trade pact with Asean gathers pace

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

New Delhi, July 18: India and Asean are working on a new value-addition norm to stop exporters from other countries misusing the proposed free trade pact between the two. 

 The proposed pact is likely to stipulate a 35 per cent value addition on a commodity in either India or Asean before being allowed to trade without a levy.

 The norm will be the cornerstone of the free trade agreement which the two will try to hammer out over the next few days in Vietnam. 

 Top officials said the two had informally agreed on the 35 per cent rule. This is midway between Indias initial demand for a 40 per cent value addition and Aseans offer of 30 per cent.

 Indian manufacturers were apprehensive of Aseans offer, fearing a deluge of tax-free Chinese goods after a screwdriver assembly in Asean countries. 

 Officials said Indian chambers now considered 35 per cent value addition reasonable. Though significant progress is expected during the current round of talks in Vietnam, the formal signing of the agreement may have to wait till October-November.

 India is now offering a far shorter negative list to Asean. Officials said many car parts and automobile tyres would be on the negative list. Duty-free trade is not allowed for items on the negative list.

 However, 30-40 out of 100 auto components will be on the open list where there will be a zero duty. Some of them will be on the sensitive list, attracting a 5 per cent levy. 

 In Vietnam, sparks are expected to fly over passenger cars which India wants on the negative list. Asean wants it in the sensitive category. 

 If India does agree to lower duties on cars from Asean, the government must offer excise duty cuts to domestic companies. This could spur higher sales, with Asean carmakers providing a stiff competition.

 Vishnu Mathur, executive director of the Auto Component Manufacturers Association, said the industry was more worried over investments getting diverted to Asean than by duty cuts. We expect about $15 billion in fresh investments in auto parts alone over the next few years. If we have a uniform duty, much of this incremental investment will get diverted to Thailand, Malaysia or even Vietnam.

 After the breakdown of WTO negotiations, India is increasingly looking at free trade agreements and comprehensive economic pacts such as the one with Singapore to strengthen ties with its key partners.

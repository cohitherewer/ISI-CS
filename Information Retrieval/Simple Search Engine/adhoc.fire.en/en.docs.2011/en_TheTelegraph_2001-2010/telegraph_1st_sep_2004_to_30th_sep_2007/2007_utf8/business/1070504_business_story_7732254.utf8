 Wait- amp;-watch on Bharat Forge 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 3: Bharat Forge will need 100-200 acres for its proposed Bengal project.

 In September last year, the company did a feasibility study for the project. It wanted land near a port for exports to China and countries in Southeast Asia.

 We did not even start the ball rolling for our Bengal project. We do not need thousands of acres. Only 100 to 200 acres will suffice. Our project has not reached the land acquisition stage in Bengal, said Amit Kalyani, executive director of Bharat Forge.

 State industry minister Nirupam Sen had earlier said the company would be shown few places such as Durgapur for its unit.

 The company, which supplies auto component parts to BMW, DaimlerChrysler and GM, was expected to invest around Rs 600 crore in the unit. Kalyani said Bharat Forge remained interested in the project and was in touch with the state government to monitor the situation.

 Commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said, Around eight months back, Bharat Forge wanted to invest here. Were still in touch with them. Theyre not interested in doing anything here at this point of time and will wait and watch. Hopefully, theyll make the investment later.

 However, Bharat Forge will now focus on its expansion project in Maharashtra for which it has received land. Its work there would proceed fast, Kalyani said.

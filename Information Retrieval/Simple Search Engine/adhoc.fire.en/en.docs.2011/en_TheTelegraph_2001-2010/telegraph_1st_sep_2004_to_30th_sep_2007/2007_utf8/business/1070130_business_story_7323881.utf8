 Calcutta, Jan. 29: Uco Bank has clocked an 11.66 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 285 crore for the nine months ended December 31, 2006.

 While city-based United Bank of India and Allahabad Bank recorded high growth (above 30 per cent) in advances, Uco Banks lending during the period grew by only 21.28 per cent. This accounts for the lower growth in profitability against a total business of Rs 1,01,167 crore as on December 31, 2006.

 The deposit growth was also low at 8.14 per cent compared with over 16 per cent of other banks. We had a credit-deposit ratio of around 72 per cent at the beginning of the current financial year and as on December 31, our credit-deposit ratio stood at 76 per cent. We could not go for aggressive lending. Besides, we didnt go for funding our advances through incremental deposits. Rather, we opted to borrow funds from Nabard, Sidbi and NHB to refinance advances. The refinance cost was cheaper by at least 50 basis points than the cost of raising deposits, said V. Sridar, chairman and managing director, Uco Bank. 

 Banks are required to keep 25 per cent of their total deposits in specified government securities as statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) and they can lend the remaining 75 per cent. Banks which have low credit-deposit ratio to begin the financial year with, could increase their lending and interest income, Sridar added.

 Uco Bank resorted to refinancing rather than large-scale deposit mobilisation in the previous financial year too, when its total deposits grew by only 10.22 per cent. 

 Uco Banks interest income from advances rose by only 21.41 per cent during the nine months on the back of lower growth in advances. Our yield on advances grew to 8.99 per cent while the cost of deposit was 5.75 per cent, Sridar said.

 The banks net non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of net advances went up from 2.13 per cent in March 2006 to 2.15 per cent in December 2006. The net NPA level came down to 2.02 per cent in September 2006.

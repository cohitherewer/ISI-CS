 Jet flight to US by August

 New destination

 New Delhi, March 23: Jet Airways plans to launch its maiden flight to the US via Belgium by July-August and make Ahmedabad the fourth Indian city in its network to have direct flights to Londons Heathrow airport from April 3.

 Jet, the countrys top private airline, had originally scheduled to start its American operations in October 2005, which got delayed by more than two years. The delay was caused by an inquiry by the US department of transportation after an American company of the same name alleged that its Indian namesake had underworld links. 

 The flight, to be operated by a Boeing-777 aircraft with a three-class configuration, may have an inaugural offer of an economy class return ticket at Rs 45,000 plus taxes. 

 According to sources, the Mumbai-Brussels-Newark flight would be a daily service. The first-class return fare would be Rs 3.45 lakh and the premium class Rs 1.48 lakh, sources added.

 The return fare for an economy class Air-India ticket is available for Rs 42,000 plus taxes, while British Airways charges Rs 1,02,670 for a round-trip between New Delhi and New York city. Virgin Atlantic offers economy class return fare from India to the US at Rs 78,390, excluding taxes.

 The private carrier is also planning to launch a series of initiatives along with a new logo, livery and seats from April 3 on London-bound flights. 

 The Ahmedabad-London flight would operate on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and return on Tuesdays and Sundays.

 From May 1, the frequency will be increased to three flights a week. These additional flights would start from Ahmedabad on Saturdays and the London-Ahmedabad flight will be on Fridays, official sources said. Jet already flies to London from Delhi, Mumbai and Amritsar. 

 The initial economy return fare on this sector would be Rs 22,000 plus taxes only, sources said, adding this inaugural fare was likely to be valid for a month.

 This flight would be operated by a wide-bodied Airbus A330-200 aircraft having 30 premier (business) class and 196 economy class seats. 

 Among the freebies to be offered on this flight is a chauffeur-driven pickup and drop for business class passengers at London within a 50-mile radius. 

 Jet, which also plans to start operations to the Gulf when the government gives permission, has a fleet of 62 aircraft with average age of a little over five years.

 At present, only the state-owned Indian and Air-India are permitted to operate to the Gulf region.

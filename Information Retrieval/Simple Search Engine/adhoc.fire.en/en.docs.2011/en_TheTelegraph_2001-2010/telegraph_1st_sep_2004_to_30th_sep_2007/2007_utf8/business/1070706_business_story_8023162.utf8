 Mumbai, July 5: Local coffee retailers are drawing up plans to expand overseas. While Caf Coffee Day is targeting Europe to extend its reach, Barista Coffee Company is exploring opportunities in Africa and Southeast Asia.

 The moves come at a time when global giants such as Starbucks and illycafe are planning to set up shop here.

 Caf Coffee Day, a division of Indias largest coffee conglomerate, Amalgamated Bean Coffee Trading Company Ltd, is planning to invest around Rs 100 crore over the next 15-24 months. 

 Part of the funds will be used to open 265 outlets in the country and 40-50 shops abroad. 

 The coffee and snacks retailer now has 435 outlets across 83 cities in the country. 

 A. Venu Madhav, head of operations, Caf Coffee Day, told The Telegraph, We will have about 700 outlets in India in a span of 15 months. Our plan covers 100 cities, which includes towns such as Agartala and Amravati. 

 Overseas, there are two outlets each in Karachi and Vienna. Madhav said there would be 15 more outlets in Austria and Pakistan within one year. The company is reportedly exploring more opportunities in Europe, particularly in Switzerland, Germany and Czech Republic. 

 We are planning to open about 40-50 outlets abroad in the next three to five years. The cost of opening a store is roughly Rs 25-30 lakh, Madhav said. 

 Earlier this year, Barista Coffee Company said it would increase the number of upscale Barista Crme bars to 25 from seven.

 The number of Barista Espresso bars will go up to 200 during this financial year, with 120 more outlets planned for the next fiscal. 

 Barista, which already operates in the Gulf countries, is exploring opportunities in Maldives, Mauritius, Egypt and Southeast Asia.

 There are also plans to open three outlets in Dhaka this year. 

 Caf Coffee Day, which has a topline of Rs 400 crore, sees a growth rate of about 50 per cent in its revenue this fiscal. The company has recently launched packaged mineral water and is adding more varieties of cookies and peanuts to its offerings. 

 The organised coffee retail business is estimated at over Rs 800 crore. 

 A surge in prices of milk, wheat and other inputs over last year has led to a rise in the prices of coffee and other readymade snacks.

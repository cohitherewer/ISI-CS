 Britannia takes Danone to court

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 20: Britannia Industries, the Wadia group company, today filed a suit against Group Danone in a Singapore court contesting the French giants unauthorised use of its Tiger biscuit brands in certain countries.

 Danone owns a 25.1 per cent stake in Britannia while Nusli Wadia and his family hold around the same stake.

 The two partners have been squabbling for sometime after Danone signalled its desire to sell its stake in Britannia and establish a fully owned subsidiary that would tap opportunities in the lucrative water and dairy segments.

 Britannia said the legal action was initiated based on the advice and under the direction from its committee on intellectual property rights (IPR).

 A press statement said the committee was created in May last year to deal with all IPR matters of Britannia. Over the past year, it has been working to settle the dispute over Danones use and registration of the Tiger brand of biscuits in several countries without the consent or authorisation from the Britannia board.

 Although company officials refused to make any further comment, the buzz is that Britannia is seeking damages from Danone for using the Tiger brand name in several countries. However, this could not be confirmed from either company.

 Sources here said Britannia was constrained to take this action as Danone had never sought its permission to use the Tiger brand in the countries. The brand has been doing extremely well in some of these countries, the source added.

 An indication to this effect was available on Wednesday at the annual general meeting of Britannia in Calcutta where chairman Nusli Wadia said a legal action had become necessary as Danone did not take its permission

 Simultaneously, Nusli Wadia also resigned from the IPR committee to ensure that there was no conflict of interest in dealing with the IPR matter even as the Wadia group and Groupe Danone discussed other issues.

 The IPR committee will now consist of Britannias managing director Vinita Bali and three independent directors, Nimesh Kampani, Keki Dadiseth and Vijay Kelkar. The committee will be chaired by Kelkar.

 This is not the first time that the two partners are locked in a fight. The Wadias had earlier gone to court over the acquisition of a 5 per cent stake by Danone in Bangalore-based Avesthagen, terming it a violation of the joint venture agreement that the latter had signed in the early 1990s.

 The Wadias and Danone are equal partners in Associated Biscuits International, which holds a 51 per cent stake in Britannia. 

 Danone has indicated its intention to exit from Britannia as it now wants to pursue independent plans in India. Early this month, both the partners held talks in this connection.

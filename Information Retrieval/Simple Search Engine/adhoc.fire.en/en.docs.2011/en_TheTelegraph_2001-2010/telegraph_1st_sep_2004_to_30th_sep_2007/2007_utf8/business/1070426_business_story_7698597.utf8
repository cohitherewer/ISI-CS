 AKG returns with mustard oil

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 25: AKG Group is re-entering the food processing business after five years.

 The company, once a household name among Bengalis for its jams, jellies and pickles, will now sell mustard oil.

 The managing director of AKG Group, B.K. Ghosh, the son of founder-chairman Ashok Ghosh, today said the company has plans to launch more products. 

 AKG still has a good brand image. We hope consumers would appreciate us the way they did earlier, he said.

 The food-processing factory of the company closed in 1995. 

 Ghosh attributed the closure to labour problems. 

 There was an attempt to start it again after retrenching workers under a golden handshake scheme, but the effort was unsuccessful. 

 We wanted assistance for working capital from the government. Even after assurances, nothing happened, he said.

 The company will outsource mustard oil from a third party and sell it in the market under its own brand name.

 I cannot ensure work for my workers round the year, since food processing is seasonal in nature. So I dont want to take any risk, Ghosh added.

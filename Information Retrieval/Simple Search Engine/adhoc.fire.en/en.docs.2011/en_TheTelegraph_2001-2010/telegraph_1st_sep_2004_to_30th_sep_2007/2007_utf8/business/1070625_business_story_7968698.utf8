 Scooters beat bikes in growth

 JAYATI GHOSE

New Delhi, June 24: Scooters are racing ahead of motorbikes to grab a bigger slice of the domestic market. Scooter sales shot up 24.52 per cent in May while that of motorcycles fell 16.36 per cent.

 Tightening of credit availability has pulled down motorcycle sales, but has not affected scooters since customers are paying in cash, said S. Srinivas, assistant general manager (marketing), TVS Motor. The urban middle class is buying the scooter as a second vehicle in the family, and they are not looking at financing the purchase, he added.

 According to data available with the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, 92,048 scooters were sold in May this year against 73,919 in the previous year.

 The Rs 2,400-crore scooter segment accounts for 10 per cent of the two-wheeler market, and looks all set for a smooth drive. It is the gearless or automatic version which is leading the race. It accounts for 80 per cent of the sales, which is around 10 lakh units per year.

 Features such as electric start, smooth transmission and storage space make the gearless scooters different from others and give them a universal appeal. They are especially popular in cities, said Sulajja Firodia Motwani, joint managing director, Kinetic Motor.

 The gearless scooter market is estimated at around Rs 350-400 crore and is likely to grow 15-20 per cent in the next five years.

 About 60 per cent of the customers for gearless scooters are women. Working women and college students prefer their own mode of transport. Gearless scooters are stylish, safe and affordable and are, therefore, popular with them, said a senior auto analyst at ICICIdirect.com. 

 Two-wheeler manufacturers have chalked out strategies to tap the growing segment as they feel the penetration level is still low. Only 5 per cent women drive two-wheelers in India compared with 31 per cent men, said Srinivas.

 Hero Honda has launched a women-oriented campaign. It introduced the Hero Honda Pleasure, a 100-cc gearless scooter, in January last year and has garnered 10 per cent of the market.

 TVS Motor has launched Scooty Pep+ in 99 colours to attract women customers. TVS Motor has also decided to offer two-wheeler training to around one lakh young women in over 100 towns. 

 In January, Bajaj Auto launched the Kristal for women and the Blade for men. Japanese company Yamaha is also planning to enter the segment soon.

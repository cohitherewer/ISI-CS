 Infosys centre in Kerala

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 19: Infosys Technologies, the countrys No. 2 software exporter, will invest Rs 306 crore to set up a campus in Thiruvananthapuram.

 The development centre will have a seating capacity of 8,000 over the next few years, K. Dinesh, co-founder and member of the Infosys board said. It will be able to seat 1,500 people over the next year.

 Infosys has an existing facility in the city with a capacity of 1,100 seats.

 Speaking at the ground-breaking ceremony for the new centre, Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan said the LDF government headed by him would extend all support to major IT companies setting up facilities in any part of the state.

 According to the chief minister, not just the state capital, but any other place in Kerala was suitable for starting IT and ITeS ventures.

 Achuthanandan said the government expected the companies to develop their facilities at sites acquired for the purpose without delay to prevent the state from taking back the land unutilised for long.

 Dinesh said, We are very happy to announce expansion plans in the state. We have plans to invest Rs 306 crore and set up a state-of-the-art campus, which would include facilities for work and recreation for our employees. We expect to create 8,000 seats at this centre over the next few years.

 Bajaj out-of-court deal hope recedes

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bajaj: Trouble brews

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: Bajaj group patriarch Rahul Bajaj today accused his brother Shishir of making additional demand for group assets.

 He said it was not possible to concede to Shishirs demands. This makes an out-of-court settlement over the division of the Bajaj empire unlikely in the near future. 

 From our side we are offering what they (Shishirs side) wanted earlier. Now they are asking for more, which we cant give them, Bajaj told reporters on the sidelines of the annual convention of the Automobile Component Manufacturers Association of India. 

 His comments come close on the heels of the Company Law Board (CLB) adjourning the hearing on the family settlement case to October 22, asking the two factions to settle the issue amicably. 

 The two sides have been trying to hammer out an agreement, but have so far been unsuccessful.

 Bajaj, however, said he was trying to settle the matter as there was still some time before the next hearing at the CLB. In case we do not succeed then we do not have any option but to go to court ... We will try our best and hope that something happens this time.

 When the CLB resumes hearing, the two sides are expected to report about the outcome of their negotiations. 

 If they fail to reach a settlement by then, the board will resume its scheduled procedure and hear the case for three consecutive days from October 23-25. The four-year-old case has reached the final stages of argument.

 Yesterday, Bajaj Auto vice-president Madhur Bajaj had said they were still trying to settle the issue. He had also said that if talks between the brothers failed, then they would be bound by the CLB order. 

 Akurdi impasse

 The Maharashtra government today said it was concerned over the closure of the Bajaj Auto plant at Akurdi near Pune.

 Ashok Chavan, state minister for industries, mines and protocol, said the government would not allow the company to use the Akurdi facility for other purposes. 

 This development comes a day after Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar met representatives of the Bajaj Auto union. We will ensure that the interests of the labour at Akurdi plant would be protected, Shavan said.

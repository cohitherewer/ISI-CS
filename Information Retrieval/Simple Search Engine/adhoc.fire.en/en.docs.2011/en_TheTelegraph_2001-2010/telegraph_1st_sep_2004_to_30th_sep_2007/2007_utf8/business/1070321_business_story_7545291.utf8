 Calcutta, March 20: Carrier Airconditioning amp; Refrigeration Ltd (Carrier India) is planning to rev up its engineering processes and supply chain and increase the manufacturing capacity.

 Announcing the launch of two models of room airconditioners here today, Carrier India managing director Zubin Irani said the company was also exploring opportunities to acquire an existing manufacturer of airconditioners and refrigerators to ramp up its capacity.

 In 2006, our sales and turnover grew 35 per cent against the industry growth rate of 25 per cent to 30 per cent. We want to maintain this tempo over the next four to five years, said Irani. This will require expanding our manufacturing capacity and streamlining engineering processes and supply chain, he added.

 Though Irani declined to give details about Carrier Indias expansion plan, he said the company was considering buying out a manufacturer as well as ramping up its own capacity. Acquiring an existing company will be more economical than setting up a greenfield plant. 

 Carrier India has one manufacturing facility at Gurgaon in Haryana. We make 200,000 units of airconditioners and refrigerators, utilising over 90 per cent of the plants installed capacity, Irani said. If our business grows by 35 per cent in 2007, which we believe it will, the manufacturing capacity will have to be augmented quickly, he said. 

 According to Irani, Carrier India will come out with a detailed expansion and acquisition plan within a month or two.

 High cost bugs auto industry

 New Delhi, April 29 (PTI): The countrys quest to become an international auto manufacturing hub can be seriously challenged by its inability to sustain a low-cost production base, global research firm KPMG has said.

 A survey conducted by the firm shows Indian auto component manufacturers becoming increasingly sceptical about sustaining the low-cost base as overheads, including labour costs and a complex tax regime, are constantly rising.

 The survey said many executives believed Indias cost advantage was eroding fast. Labour costs are on the rise and retaining employees is becoming difficult.

 An increased presence of global automotive companies in the country was cited as one of the reasons for the high attrition rate.

 One of the auto component companies surveyed said it recruited 10 per cent more management staff than it actually required, expecting the staff retention challenge to intensify.

 Another company believed that the Indian auto business would prosper only if they increased investments in automation.

 In the longer term, cost advantage will only be retained if Indian capital can be used to develop low-cost automation in manufacturing. This is the way to preserve our low cost, the survey quoted the company as saying. 

 The survey said the automation system must cost less it will not help if Indian industry imports automation at the same price that the developed world has paid. Global auto companies are also sceptical about Indias low-cost manufacturing base.

 The survey quotes a European car maker as saying, There are some costs which could fall, but dont. Taxation in India remains a big disadvantage. This is not about tax rates, it is just about unnecessary complexity.

 But some companies also believed there was scope to reduce the cost. There are opportunities to exploit lower costs across the board, said one component manufacturer.

 The company said labour costs were increasing but they were still 5 per cent of the total operational costs. The labour costs can be further reduced if companies are successful in bringing down other costs such as that of power.

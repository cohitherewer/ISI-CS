 Chidambaram: Tough times

 New Delhi, March 16: The inflation rate touched 6.46 per cent for the week ended March 3 as the government assured the Lok Sabha that all necessary steps were being taken to keep prices in check.

 Inflation was receding and had touched 6.05 per cent for the week ended February 17. However, after that it shifted course and is now edging towards the two-year high of 6.73 per cent recorded in early February.

 The Congress, facing a stern electoral test in Uttar Pradesh next month, is worried that prices will scupper its chances in the state, which it can ill-afford after the reverses in Punjab and Uttarakhand in February.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram told the Lok Sabha that the RBI has been directed to ensure price stability. Since inflation is a monetary phenomenon, the RBI has the direct responsibility of maintaining price stability.

 He said the macroeconomic aggregates of the money market is reeking of inflation. Money supply is growing at 21 per cent. Non-food credit has increased, year on year, by 30 per cent.

 He said during his meeting with the RBI board last week he had asked the central bank to keep a vigil on prices and take measures for price stability.

 He said the RBI measures would rein in core inflation and that he expected the overall inflation rate to ease in the next weeks and months.

 Cement prices

 The finance minister said the government was hopeful of cement makers cutting prices. He also promised a review of the export duty on iron ore.

 The government is still hopeful that cement manufacturers will realise their responsibility and moderate prices, Chidambaram told the Lok Sabha.

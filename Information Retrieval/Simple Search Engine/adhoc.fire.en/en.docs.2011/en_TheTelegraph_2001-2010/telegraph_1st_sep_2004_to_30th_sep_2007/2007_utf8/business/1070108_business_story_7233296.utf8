 CII calls for $1.5trillion investment in 5 years

 New Delhi, Jan. 7 (PTI): India requires $1.5 trillion worth of investment to achieve a 9.5 per cent average growth in the next five years, according to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 Year 2007 should be the year of investments and the required increase should be handled carefully with skilful planning and monitoring, CII president R. Seshasayee said.

 The chamber expects the incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) for the plan period to deteriorate to 3.8 per cent from 3.6 per cent. But this decline will be compensated by an increase in investment to GDP ratio to 36.2 per cent from 30 per cent. The study has identified four broad sources of raising the revenue: public sector, private sector, households and FDI that contributed 29.6 per cent, 27.7 per cent, 39.8 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively in 2004-05.

 More emphasis needs to be given to FDI as there is great potential to increase its magnitude and it also brings the required expertise and technology, the chamber said. Favourable global environment should see India targeting about 2.5 per cent of GDP as foreign direct investment against the current 1 per cent.

 The chamber said infrastructure spending by the end of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan should go up to at least 10 per cent of GDP. Around $337.5 billion worth of investment is required to be pumped into infrastructure to achieve an average of 9.5 per cent growth.

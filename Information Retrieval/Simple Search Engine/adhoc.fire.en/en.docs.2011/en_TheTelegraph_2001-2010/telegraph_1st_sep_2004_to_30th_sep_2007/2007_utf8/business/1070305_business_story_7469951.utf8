 Local tech firms outshine MNCs

 Silicon Valley, March 4 (PTI): Indian firms outperform some or all of the multinational companies in many areas of application development and maintenance (ADM) services, according to a new research study. Through the years, conventional wisdom has been that the US clients will turn to India-based firms for low programming rates and to multinationals, largely US-based, for better performance.

 However, a recent performance monitor study involving global customers and market analysts shows that Indian firms outperform some or all of the multinational firms in a number of areas of ADM services. As a group, the Indian companies are on a par with the seven multinational companies.

 These results clearly challenge the conventional belief that multinational providers have a corner on ADM performance. The India-based firms have arrived, said the research firm.

 The research is based on inputs from 864 clients of 11 leading ADM providers, seven of which are multinationals and four are India-based. The four Indian companies that were considered in the survey are Cognizant, Infosys, Wipro and TCS.

 The seven leading multinationals are Accenture, Capgemini, EDS, Fujitsu Services, Hewlett Packard, IBM and Siemens Business Services. 

 The various players were rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high) on various parameters.

 For multiple integrated applications, Cognizant Technology Solutions scored the highest, while Wipro topped the list in engagements with annual run rates of $10 million or more.

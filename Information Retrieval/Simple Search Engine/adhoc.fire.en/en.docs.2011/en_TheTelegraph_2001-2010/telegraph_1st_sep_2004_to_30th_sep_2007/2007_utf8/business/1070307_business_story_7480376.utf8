 New Delhi, March 6: Real estate firm DLF has tied up with Prudential Financial Inc, an US-based life insurer, to enter the life insurance business in India. The companies plan to invest about Rs 1,000 crore over the next 10 years in the venture.

 The new company DLF Pramerica Life Insurance Company (DLF Pramerica) will kick-start operations by early 2008 with a paid-up capital of Rs 100 crore, which is the minimum stipulated capital requirement. It has already applied for a licence to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda).

 According to the agreement, DLF will hold a 74 per cent stake and Prudential will hold the balance 26 per cent in the joint venture. 

 Pramerica is a brand name used in select countries by Prudential Financial, said Kapil Mehta, chief representative India of the company.

 Apart from cashing in on existing products, Prudential Financial is in talks with several banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) to distribute its insurance products, said Mehta.

 While Prudential Financial will manage the operations of the new company, both partners will have representatives on the board of the company, said a DLF spokesperson.

 Rajiv Singh, vice-chairman of DLF, said, Prudential Financial is the perfect partner to work with us.

 Calcutta, May 8: Power companies are setting up eight mini-hydel projects in Darjeeling district, which will add 40mw to the North Bengal grid. 

 The first of the projects, a 3mw unit of the city-based Nippon Power, went on stream today. We have identified a generation capacity of 200mw hydel power in the state, most of which is in North Bengal, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said at a function here to mark the inauguration of the Nippon plant. The project is at Lodhama, 60km from Darjeeling.

 We have invited private companies to set up seven mini-hydel projects with generation capacity of 40mw in Darjeeling. The estimated investment will be Rs 300 crore, Bhattacharjee said.

 Nippon has invested Rs 15 crore on the plant. It received a loan from the World Bank, which was routed through Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency. 

 The Lodhama power project has been developed on a build-own-operate basis, P.C. Saraogi, managing director of Nippon Power, said. Nippon will sell power to the state for Rs 2.25 per unit.

 However, the Bengal power board has reportedly agreed to purchase the power at a feed-in tariff for five years. 

 Feed-in tariff is the price a utility or supplier has to pay for renewable electricity from producers. This tariff also involves an obligation on the part of distributors to buy a minimum percentage of their energy requirements from non-conventional or renewable power producers. 

 Hydel projects having a capacity of less than 25mw are considered renewable sources of power. Other companies setting up projects in Darjeeling include Shyam Steel and Texmaco.

 Board set to clear more SEZ proposals

 New Delhi, July 27 (PTI): The board of approval for special economic zones will meet on August 8 to consider eight cases, including two from Infosys, as the process gathers momentum after a change in norms and less political resistance.

 After the August 8 meeting, we will have a large chunk of SEZ proposals that had piled up before the assembly polls because of political opposition in various parts of the country cleared, a government official said.

 With the empowered group of ministers changing the rules and putting a cap of 5,000 hectares on multi-product zones in April, the stage was set for faster clearances.

 As of now, the board had approved 547 zones, of which 132 had been notified. The board has given formal clearances to 362 and in-principle clearance to 177 zones. Nearly 200 cases had been considered in five meetings since May 9.

 Listed for in-principle approval at the August 8 meeting are Adarsh Prime Projects 468-hectare IT SEZ in Karnataka, Enfield Infrastructures 16-hectare IT Zone in Bengal and the 10-hectare Genpact project in Rajasthan. 

 Other proposals include two from Infosys Technologies for IT Zones in Andhra Pradesh and a biotech SEZ by Veritas Infrastructure Development Ltd.

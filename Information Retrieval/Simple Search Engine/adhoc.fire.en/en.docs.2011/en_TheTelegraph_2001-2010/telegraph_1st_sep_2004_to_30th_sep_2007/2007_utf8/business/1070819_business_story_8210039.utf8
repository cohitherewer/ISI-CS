The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Panel for closed tea gardens on the cards

 Ramesh: Revival plans

 Calcutta, Aug. 18: The Centre will set up a committee to evaluate the future of the countrys closed tea gardens.

 The committee will be headed by the additional secretary of plantation. The Tea Board chairman and representatives from Bengal, Kerala and Assam will also be on the panel.

 The committee will evaluate proposals for a change in the management of the closed gardens by invoking section 16(E) of the Tea Act, 1953. Eight of the 17 closed gardens in Kerala have reopened. Two gardens in Assam are in the midst of litigation. Therefore, the committee will focus on the closed gardens in Bengal, where only one of the 14 gardens have reopened, Jairam Ramesh, minister of state for commerce and industry, told The Telegraph.

 Under section 16(E), the Tea Board will be able to take over gardens, which are closed for more than three months, and find new owners. 

 This is the first time in 54 years that provision 16(E) is being invoked.

 We already have offers for a few gardens and want them to get off the ground as soon as possible. After the announcement of the central package for the closed gardens, the owners should not delay opening them, Ramesh added.

 The committee will also have the additional secretary and financial adviser, department of commerce, as its member. The ministry has asked the governments of Kerala, Bengal and Assam to nominate the principal secretary or the secretary from the plantation, commerce or finance department on the panel.

 Ramesh was keen that a senior representative of the central government head such a committee, as the tea act is a central legislation.

 PSU insurers raise mediclaim fee

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

Calcutta, April 15: General insurance companies are raising the premium on mediclaim for individuals.

 The latest to raise the rate is the National Insurance Company, whose policies in the above-25 categories are costlier by 5 per cent to 100 per cent from April.

 In October last year, Oriental Insurance Company hiked its rates by 5 per cent to 150 per cent in the above-20 categories.

 The other two public sector insurers United Insurance Company and New India Assurance Company have reportedly submitted their revised rate proposals to the insurance regulator. Their policies are also expected become costlier.

 The four public sector insurers have more than 75 per cent market share of the medical insurance business. Private sector insurers are already charging higher premium than their public sector rivals.

 As of now, medical insurance is a hugely loss-making business for us. The claim ratio in this business is 130 per cent (which means the company pays claims of Rs 130 for every Rs 100 premium it gets). This is unsustainable. By restructuring the premium and policies, we expect to bring down the claim ratio to 110 per cent, said Dilip K. Burman, director and general manager of National Insurance Company. 

 The rate hike has been steep in the above-45 category. Both Oriental Insurance and National Insurance have raised their medical insurance premium in this grade by more than 50 per cent.

 The rate rise is the steepest for senior citizens by over 100 per cent. National Insurance has also decided not to issue fresh policies to those in the 59-65 age bracket. United Insurance Company has also reduced the maximum age of entry to 55 years from 60. 

 We had factored in the rate hike when we came out with the Varishtha Mediclaim plan last December for senior citizens, said Burman.

 However, National Insurance and Oriental Insurance have reduced the rates for people below 25 years. We have reduced our premium rate for this age group by 20 per cent, Burman said. The cut is between 10 and 15 per cent for Oriental Insurance.

 Insurers are also specifying the maximum amount they will bear as expenses under different expenditure heads. For instance, there can be a cap of 10 per cent of sum assured on hospital room rent, 20 to 25 per cent on doctor fees and 50 per cent on diagnostic expenditure. 

 This restructuring call it co-payment or expenditure sub-limits will help reduce the widespread misuse of mediclaim policies, Burman said. 

 If the insured opts the reimbursement option over the cashless option, he or she will get a 6 per cent discount on premium, he added.

 Singhvi: Exit mode

 Mumbai, April 20: Anil Singhvi, managing director of Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd (GACL), today tendered his resignation at the board meeting held to consider the companys quarterly results.

 In a notice sent to stock exchanges, GACL said Singhvi had submitted his resignation as managing director.

 Singhvi will be with the company till April 30. A.L. Kapur, who is now the whole-time director, will be the managing director from May 1, GACL said.

 Singhvi worked with GACL for more than two decades and is believed to be the architect of the Gujarat Ambuja-Holcim deal. He was appointed as the managing director of GACL in 2006 for five years. It is believed that Singhvi is floating a financial advisory company.

 GACL has posted an over 43 per cent growth in net profit for the first quarter ended March 31 at Rs 590.74 crore compared with Rs 412.77 crore in the same period last year. 

 Total income (net of excise) grew to Rs 1,700.25 crore for the quarter from Rs 1,131.07 crore last year.

 GACL said there was a demand growth of 6.6 per cent in the quarter. The company feels the demand for cement will be strong in future following a robust economic growth.

 It said the cement grinding units of one million tonnes each at Farakka in Bengal and Roorkee in Uttaranchal would be commissioned during the current quarter. 

 The cement plant at Rabriyawas in Rajasthan is likely to be upgraded by July this year. This would increase its clinkering capacity to 2 million tonnes from 1.5 million tonnes. 

 The company has also commissioned the first phase of the 30-mw power plant at Ambujanagar during the quarter and the second phase is expected to be commissioned this quarter.

 GACL shares today ended at Rs 115.45 on the Bombay Stock Exchange against the previous close of Rs 113.45.

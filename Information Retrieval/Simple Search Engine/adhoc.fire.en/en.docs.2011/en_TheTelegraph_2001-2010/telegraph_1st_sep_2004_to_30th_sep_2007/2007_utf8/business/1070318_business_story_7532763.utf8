 Ray of hope for dispute-free SEZs 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 17: Commerce minister Kamal Nath indicated today that the empowered group of ministers headed by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee would go ahead with the SEZ cases that do not involve any land dispute. 

 Of course, there is a fear now where land acquisition is concerned... but where there is no land in dispute why should we be worried, Nath said.

 He said the land acquisition must be transparent and he was personally in favour of giving farmers a stake in the project that comes up on their land in addition to the market price. 

 The minister said the UPA government remains committed to the special economic zones with full support from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

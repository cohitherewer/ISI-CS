 Honda small car unit at Alwar

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 3: Honda Motors is revving up to join the small car race. The Japanese carmaker will initially invest Rs 1,000 crore to set up a manufacturing plant at Alwar in Rajasthan that will roll out the small car. This will be Hondas second plant in the country. The company already has a unit in Greater Noida.

 Honda Siel will manufacture two models at the Alwar plant. One of the models will be the small car while the other will be from the existing line-up, said Masahiro Takedagawa, president and CEO of Honda Siel Cars India.

 While Honda signed an MoU with the Rajasthan government for the new plant, Takedagawa refused to disclose details of the small car model.

 Scheduled to roll out its first car in 2009, the new plant will initially produce 60,000 cars a year. Honda plans to invest another Rs 1,000 crore later to eventually raise the production capacity at the new facility to 2 lakh units. The plant will be spread over 600 acres and will house various ancillary units.

 Honda Siels unit at Greater Noida has a production capacity of 50,000 units. This will be raised to 1 lakh by the end of this year.

 With the new facility in Rajasthan, Honda Siels total capacity will increase to more than 150,000 units by 2010, company officials said.

 As part of the MoU signed today, Rajasthan will provide various concessions to Honda.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 31: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is among the 11 winners for oil and gas exploration blocks announced by the Australian government.

 RIL won the bid for an exploration licence in part of the Bonaparte Basin, off northern Australia. It proposes to spend A$29.8 million over the next six years. This includes the cost of drilling one well.

 China National Offshore Oil Corp, Total SA, Hess Corp, Santos Ltd and Woodside Petroleum Ltd also won offshore licences. The auction will result in an investment of more than A$800 million ($688 million) on exploration over the next six years.

 Australia awards oil and gas exploration permits depending on the amount of work bidders pledge to carry out.

 Policy rejig for better fertiliser use

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, July 23: A group of ministers will tomorrow discuss the possibility of replacing subsidies to urea makers with relief for using a specific mix of nutrients.

 A panel set up by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said large tracts of land have turned barren because of a excessive use of one fertiliser urea. 

 The panel attributed this to the policy of subsidising urea, making it cheaper than most other fertilisers.

 It is being suggested that fertiliser companies should mix nutrients for various soils, to be sold as separate products. 

 A subsidy will be paid on the retail price if the farmer picks up the nutrient mix that best suits the soil of the district.

 Subsidy payments can be made to either the farmer or the marketer. 

 This scheme has fixed a Rs 26,000-crore upper limit for subsidies, compared with Rs 34,000 crore that was disbursed in 2006-07 and a projected relief of Rs 45,000 crore for this fiscal.

 The farmer will not feel the impact of the reduced subsidy as industry will be forced to design more efficient products choosing the right combination of nutrients. The increased efficiency of nutrient use will more than compensate the reduced subsidy, officials said.

 Tata Consultancy Services in a report to the department of fertilisers has suggested smart cards for farmers to buy the fertiliser mix at cheaper rates. 

 However, the proposal has not found favour with states.

 Smart cards, according to the government, will allow subsidies directly to farmers. 

 It can also be targeted at a particular segment, for example, small and marginal farmers could get more subsidy in percentage terms. 

 However, if a section of farmers is left uncovered by the new system, they will suffer considerably. 

 Prices of fertilisers, too, will not be controlled, bringing them on a par with global values.

 Fertiliser units who are efficient will gain, while the laggards may fall by the wayside.

 Meanwhile, the department of fertilisers has proposed the revival of the freight equalisation scheme for the supply of natural gas to the fertiliser industry.

 Under this scheme, freight incentives are given to industries located far away from raw material sources. This system was done away with in 1992. 

 The department is keen on reviving the scheme as the fertiliser sector wants priority in natural gas allocation.

 The department fears that since natural gas is being supplied from a few regions in the country, its availability will only benefit companies that are located close to the feedstock. Companies located far away from the source will be burdened with higher costs.

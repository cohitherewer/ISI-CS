 North Block feels the heat

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, March 10: Pressure is mounting on the finance ministry to raise the interest payout on its special deposit scheme (SDS) in which much of the cash invested in the employees provident fund (EPF) is parked. 

 With key elections round the corner, political parties want the North Block to raise the SDS rate by 50-100 basis points from the present 8 per cent. Any rise in the EPF rate, which stands at 8.5 per cent, can only fructify if the finance ministry agrees. 

 Returns on EPF can become a major political issue as millions of industrial workers have to save in this scheme compulsorily. 

 They have already started comparing the yields on this fund with that of bank fixed deposits. While bank deposits are currently fetching between 9 per cent and 9.5 per cent, the yield on government bonds has gone up to 8 per cent.

 The over Rs 1,40,000-crore EPFO fund invests about 80 per cent of its corpus in SDS deposits. The remaining 20 per cent is invested in other government and state-run corporation bonds that fetch a higher rate of interest. 

 The current average yield from EPF investments is estimated to be around 8.15 per cent, with public sector securities yielding the highest return. 

 At current returns, the government can afford to pay an interest rate of no more than 8 per cent. 

 The fund will face a deficit of Rs 450 crore in the current fiscal if the rate is sustained.

 However, if the SDS pay-out rate is increased to 9 per cent, the EPFO can safely pay workers an interest rate of 8.75 per cent without making any loss.

 If it wishes to continue bearing a small loss, it can actually pass on the entire hike to subscribers.

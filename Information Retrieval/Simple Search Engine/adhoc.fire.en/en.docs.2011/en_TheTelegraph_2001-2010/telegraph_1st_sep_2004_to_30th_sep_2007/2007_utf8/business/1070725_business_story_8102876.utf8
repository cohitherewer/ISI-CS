 Two-part Bilt share rejig 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 24: The board of paper manufacturer Ballarpur Industries (Bilt) today announced a stock split and a subsequent share buyback plan.

 Each share will be split into five, and Bilt then proposes to buy back two of the five shares. The company, therefore, proposes to buy back 40 per cent of its share capital.

 Bilt will buy back the shares for Rs 25 each. It said it valued each share prior to the split at Rs 125 for capital restructuring.

 Small shareholders owning up to 1,000 shares prior to the split can sell their entire holdings. In this case, the company will pay Rs 30 per share for the extra portion.

 The board has also approved hiving off Bilts three units into a separate entity and raising Rs 1,950 crore.

 Bilt has raised a debt of Rs 1,450 crore to fund the acquisition of Sabah Forest Industries in Malaysia. The restructuring will help us in repaying this debt and bring down the interest component in our books, Bilt group finance director B. Hariharan told reporters here.

 The reorganisation would be used to raise Rs 1,950 crore to repay loans taken for the Sabah acquisition and keep funds for the proposed share buyback programme.

 According to the scheme, subject to regulatory approvals, the company would hive off its units at Bhigwan, Ballarpur and Kamalapuram into a wholly owned subsidiary Bilt Graphic Paper Products Ltd.

 The assets of Bilt Graphic would then be transferred to Bilt for Rs 1,950 crore by issuing shares worth Rs 450 crore and non-convertible debentures of Rs 1,500 crore.The company would transfer Bilt Graphics shares and debentures to another subsidiary in Netherlands Ballarpur Paper Holdings within 40 days of getting necessary approvals by the court.

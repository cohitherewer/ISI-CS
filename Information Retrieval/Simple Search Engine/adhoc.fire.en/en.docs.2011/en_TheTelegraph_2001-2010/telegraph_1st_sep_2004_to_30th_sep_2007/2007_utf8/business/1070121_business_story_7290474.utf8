 Paswan missive to protect Kudremukh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Paswan: The saviour

 New Delhi, Jan. 20: Steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan has asked the mines ministry to allot Khandadhar mines in Orissa to state-run Kudremukh Iron Ore Company Ltd (KIOCL).

 The mines ministry is studying a proposal sent by the Orissa government seeking to reserve prospecting licence of these mines for Korean steel giant Posco.

 In a letter addressed to mines minister Sis Ram Ola, the steel minister has pointed out that KIOCL, which is under steel ministry, has already prospected Khandadhar mining area and, under section 11(1) of the Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, has a preferential right to allotment of the mining lease.

 According to Paswans aides, the issue had also been brought to the notice of the Orissa government. The steel secretary has sent a letter to the chief secretary of the Orissa government to this effect.

 Kudremukh needs to get the Khandadhar mines to stay alive as its mining operations in Karnataka have been stopped by an order of the Supreme Court.

 Paswans letter pleads that unless Kudremukh is given mining leases it could hit the interest of its workers, who number in thousands. 

 Posco, which too has faced protests over land acquisition in its bid to set up a 12-million-tonne steel plant in Orissa, needs the prospecting licence to find out how much ore it can extract from the area. 

 The Orissa government is committed to providing the Korean major lease over iron ore mines with reserves of 600 million tonnes of high-grade ore. 

 Paswan seems to have sided with the Opposition in Orissa which is demanding that the interest of state-run mining major should be protected first before handing over prime mines to Posco.

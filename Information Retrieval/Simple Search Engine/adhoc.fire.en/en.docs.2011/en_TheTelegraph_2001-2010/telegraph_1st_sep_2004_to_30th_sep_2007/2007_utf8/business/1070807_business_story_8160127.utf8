 New Delhi, Aug. 6: The Left is seething over the audacious move by Wal-Mart and the Bharti group to adroitly open a backdoor for multinationals to storm the retailing business and its rage could queer the pitch for large domestic players as well.

 It could also trigger a fresh demand to plug the franchisee route by which multinationals can still enter the retail market in the country.

 The Left parties have already been demanded a regulator for big businesses entering the retail arena in a bid to create a level playing field between multinationals and Indian big business houses both of which threaten to destroy the livelihood of small grocers.

 They are likely to step up pressure on this demand. CPM leader Nilotpal Basu told The Telegraph, We have always been talking of a regulator for business houses entering retail ... there is need to check predatory practices.

 Left-ruled states have not yet allowed the Reliance group to set up the large retail chain it had been planning to set up in the Left-ruled bastions of Bengal and Kerala. Nor is the Left likely to allow other big Indian business houses like the Birlas and the Wadias to set up large format retail chains which could threaten small retailers, in the near future. 

 Stores which are already there cannot be shut down. But we must place checks and safeguards to see that not only transnationals do not threaten small retailers but also our own big business houses, said RSP leader Abani Roy. Some 25 million shops and 80 million workers could be impacted. With their deep pockets and strategic pricing strategies, they could deal a deathblow to these tiny independent businesses.

 These large retail chains need to be limited to big cities. If they reach the smaller towns, we could see huge social ferment created by a new class of unemployed, Roy said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Guarded response to Jindal offer

 OUR BUREAU

Calcutta/New Delhi, June 1: Praise tempered with caution was the reaction of India Inc to the Jindal package for land acquisition, while the Bengal government downplayed the cash and stock deal.

 The Jindals yesterday offered cash and stock to compensate 742 families from whom they expect to buy land for their steel plant at Salboni in West Midnapore district of Bengal.

 The three apex chambers CII, Ficci and Assocham welcomed the move, but companies planning to set up units in the state are not willing to toe the Jindal line.

 Bhushan Steel, which will set up a 2-million-tonne steel plant at Salanpur near Asansol, said it would follow the rehabilitation package of the state government.

 We shall follow the same rehabilitation package which has been agreed upon at the time of signing of the agreement with the Bengal government. We would not like to have any deviation in that, a Bhushan Steel official said.

 The company will pay only cash for the 2,500 acres and set up a technical institute, which it will run for a few years before handing it over to the state government.

 We will train people. Depending on their capabilities, employment will be provided. But there is no one job per family commitment, he added. 

 Real estate major DLF, which is setting up an integrated township spread over 5,000 acres at Dankuni, also said it would only make a cash contribution.

 We bought the global tender agreeing to pay a very competitive price to the Calcutta municipality which has to acquire the land and give it to us, Yogesh Verma, CEO of DLF, told The Telegraph.

 Bhushan and DLFs views underline what India Inc has to say about the Jindal package: there can be other models of equity before the industry and policy-makers.

 It is a thoughtful package. I am sure people will pick up ideas from it and develop their own, S.S. Mehta, director-general of CII, said.

 Assocham secretary-general D.S. Rawat said the chamber was the first to suggest such a move. He proposed companies should buy the land directly from farmers without any state intervention. 

 Though he praised the move, Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra had a word of caution. The implementation is the key. Only the targeted people shall be the equity holder and actual beneficiary. 

 Similar views were expressed by Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen. It (package) is good, but what do the rural farmers understand about shares? Its city people like us who are interested in these things.

 BNCCI secretary Khokon Mookerji believes companies can replicate the Jindal model on a larger scale without hurting bottomlines.

 Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah demanded today that land losers should be paid the market value of the land prevailing when a project comes up.

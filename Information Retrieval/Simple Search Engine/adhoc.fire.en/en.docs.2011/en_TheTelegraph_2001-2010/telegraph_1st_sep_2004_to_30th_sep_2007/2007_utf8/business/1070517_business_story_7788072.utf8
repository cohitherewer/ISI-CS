 Export units get the stick

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 TESTING TIME

 New Delhi, May 16: The comptroller and auditor general has found serious irregularities in the functioning of export oriented units (EOUs). The CAG finding comes at a time when the controversy over the potential revenue leakage from SEZs is raging in the country.

 According to the CAG, several export units, though smaller than SEZs, have been flouting norms and enjoying duty exemptions. 

 The CAG report said duty-free irregular imports by EOUs are a huge drain on government revenue and there is an urgent need to put in place a workable co-ordinated mechanism between the commerce and finance ministries to detect such lapses and recover duty from them.

 This report will strengthen the finance ministrys argument that too many concessions should not be granted to the exporters. The commerce ministry is in favour of extended sops to exporters.

 According to the CAG, the government could raise an additional Rs 1,125 crore if follow-up action is taken on the irregularities detected in the audit.

 The report says the data on the total number of EOUs approved and those that are functional is incomplete and unreliable, making it difficult to ensure whether these units are functioning within the existing norms and regulations. 

 The audit found that in some instances duty worth Rs 285.81 crore had not been levied on imports made by some EOUs, violating the prescribed norms. The customs department also did not recover duty and interest to the tune of Rs 574 crore from 47 EOUs that failed to achieve their net foreign exchange earnings. 

 The CAG has reviewed 565 functional and 386 closed EOUs to find out whether these functioned according to prescribed norms and regulations and had achieved intended export obligations commensurate with duty exemption that they had enjoyed on imports made by them.

 SAIL to get more say in foreign takeovers

 Patna, Feb. 4 (PTI): The Centre plans to relax the existing rules to help the Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) join the race for takeover of foreign steel companies, steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.

 The existing rules put certain limitations on SAIL when it comes to buying foreign companies, Paswan said at a dealers conference here last evening.

 Paswan pointed out that SAIL has already started buying sick public sector units such as IISCO, Bharat Refractories Limited, and Neelanchal Ispat Ltd. He said buoyed by SAILs profit of Rs 14,000 crore, the Centre was planning to invest Rs 1 lakh crore by 2020 for its expansion.

 He said his ministry has taken a policy decision for uniform pricing of all steel products of SAIL across the country. Paswan added that SAIL would adopt 10 steel villages in the country under a social development programme.

 SAIL has reported a 124 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 1,471 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2006 compared with Rs 656 crore in the same period last year.

 The company has also declared an interim dividend of 16 per cent against the paid-up equity amounting to Rs 660.86 crore for the nine-month period ended December 31.

 SAILs total income during the quarter stood at Rs 8,760.16 crore compared with Rs 6,736.84 crore in the same quarter previous fiscal, up 30 per cent quarter-on-quarter.

 BSNL faces heat over Motorola deal bar

 Telecom Tussle

New Delhi, July 8 (PTI): The department of telecom is understood to have questioned BSNLs decision to disqualify Motorola from participating in the financial bid for its GSM tender.

 According to sources, telecom minister A. Raja has written a letter to the BSNL management seeking reasons for disqualifying Motorola. 

 Earlier, the US-based telecom equipment firm had challenged the move in Delhi High Court.

 Sources said Motorolas financial bid was not considered because it did not have experience in 3G telephony.

 BSNL had invited bids for adding 45.5 million GSM lines. Swedish telecom equipment supplier Ericsson had emerged the lowest bidder quoting about $107 per line followed by Nokia with a quote of $160 a connection.

 The department had said that Motorola had offered a price of about $70 a line to another PSU, MTNL, for the existing mobile telecom services. 

 Had BSNL allowed Motorola to participate in the tender, it would have saved a lot of money.

 Sources said some of the private players in the telecom equipment industry were in constant touch with the BSNL Employees Union to ensure that the orders were placed to the two successful bidders. 

 The BSNL employees, numbering more than 3.4 lakh, will go on strike on July 11 to mount pressure on the government for awarding the contract to the selected vendors.

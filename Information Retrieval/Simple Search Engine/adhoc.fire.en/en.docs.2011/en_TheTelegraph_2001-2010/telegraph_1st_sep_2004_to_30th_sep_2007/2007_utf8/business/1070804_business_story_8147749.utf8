 Punj Lloyd takes realty plunge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 3: Engineering company Punj Lloyd has formed a 50:50 joint venture with the Ramprastha group to develop multi-storied residential complexes.

 The two companies will develop residential apartments in Ghaziabad in approximately 29 acres in the first phase. In the second phase, substantial real estate development is proposed in Indrapuram and Gurgaon, where the Ramprastha group holds large plots of land. 

 Punj Lloyd (or its affiliates) is expected to make an initial investment of Rs 180 crore in the joint venture. The Ramprastha group has also planned a similar investment.

 Punj Lloyd said Ghaziabad was rapidly emerging as the residential hub for IT professionals working in Noida and Delhi. The city was also gaining in popularity because of its proximity to the location of the Commonwealth Games, he added.

 The projects will develop approximately 2.5 million sq ft area. They are expected to be completed in four years.

 The planning, design and construction of the residential complexes will be done by Punj Lloyds Singapore-based subsidiary, Sembawang Engineers and Constructors.

 The Ramprastha group is a real estate development company focused on development in the national capital region.

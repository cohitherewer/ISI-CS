 Great going 

 New Delhi, May 8: South Africas competition commission has cleared Ranbaxys $70-million acquisition of Be-Tabs. The deal will make Ranbaxy the fifth largest generic firm in South Africa. 

 Be-Tabs will remain an independent trading entity and will form one of the three companies in the Ranbaxy SA Group, the other two being Sonke Pharmaceuticals and Ranbaxy (S.A.) (Pty) Ltd. 

 As part of this acquisition, Ranbaxy has concluded a Black Empowerment transaction with a Community Investment Holding group company.

 Peter Burema, president of Ranbaxys global pharmaceutical division, said, The acquisition of Be-Tabs will ensure that Ranbaxy develops deeper roots in South Africa. 

 The deal will make Ranbaxy one of the few generic pharmaceutical companies to invest in and develop local manufacturing functionality.

 Desmond Brothers, CEO, Ranbaxy SA, said: The companys decision to manufacture locally will not only help it to provide quality medicine at an affordable price to the Southern African market, but will also mean a further investment of approximately Rs 10 crore in the local economy. 

 Ranjan Chakravarti, Ranbaxys regional director in Africa and Latin America, said, Ranbaxy entered South Africa with a business model that aimed at meeting the need for an affordable healthcare. The acquisition, with its market presence and substantial manufacturing capabilities, is another step towards achieving this goal.

 The acquisition will strengthen Ranbaxys product basket especially in the acute and over-the-counter segments. 

 The company expects to use the brand equity that Be-Tabs has acquired to leverage market share among wholesalers, pharmacies, dispensing doctors and consumers.

 Ranbaxy is also planning to upgrade the Be-Tabs manufacturing facility.

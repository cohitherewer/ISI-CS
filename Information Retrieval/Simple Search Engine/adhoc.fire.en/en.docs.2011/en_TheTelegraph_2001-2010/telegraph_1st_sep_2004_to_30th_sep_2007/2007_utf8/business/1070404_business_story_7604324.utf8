 Mumbai, April 3: North American chocolate and confectionery company Hershey will acquire a 51 per cent stake in Godrej Beverages and Food Ltd for a consideration of around Rs 261 crore. The stake also includes a 40 per cent equity held by IL amp;FS.

 Hershey also entered into a joint venture with the Godrej arm to manufacture and distribute confectionery, snacks and beverages in India. The joint venture will give Godrej a long-term partner with global brands and international technology to increase its food and beverage business. Hershey will also get a platform to launch its brands in the confectionery market of India.

 Confectionery products like Hersheys Reese, Hersheys Kisses, Hersheys Special Dark Chocolate Covered Almonds, Hersheys Milk Chocolate Covered Almonds and a wide range of mint and gum-flavoured refreshment will now be available in India.

 Godrej Beverages will be renamed as Godrej Hershey Foods amp; Beverages Ltd. Godrej Industries will hold a 43 per cent stake in the joint venture and A. Mahendran, mentor director of Godrej Hershey Foods amp; Beverages, will own 6 per cent.

 Godrej Group chairman Adi Godrej said, The global brand equity and experience of Hershey and Godrej Beverages distribution strength and its understanding of Indian consumers will complement each other well. This will leverage Godrejs access to a strong portfolio of confectionery brands.

 With manufacturing units at Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh and Mandideep in Madhya Pradesh, Godrej Beverages has a total turnover of Rs 400 crore. It is setting up a manufacturing plant in Himachal Pradesh, which would be functional in the next few months.

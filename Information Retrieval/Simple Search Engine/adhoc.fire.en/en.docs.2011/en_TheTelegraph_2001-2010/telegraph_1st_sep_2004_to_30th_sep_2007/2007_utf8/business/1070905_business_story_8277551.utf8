 A common loyalty programme has been worked out by the hotels under the terms of the joint marketing alliance that was signed today.

 Members of the Taj loyalty programme Taj Inner Circle can avail themselves of the facilities of Okura Club, the loyalty scheme of the Japanese hotel. The alliance extends to reservations, with a Okura customer booking a Taj room and vice versa.

 These facilities are for select hotels of Taj and Okura. Some of the Taj hotels in the alliance are Taj Mahal Palace amp; Tower, Mumbai, Taj Mahal, Delhi and Taj Boston.

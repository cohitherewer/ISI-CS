 Q amp;A

 Interest in ELSS

 I want to invest in equity-linked savings schemes. I do not know where I can get it. Kindly give me some guidance.

 D.N. Choudhuri, Midnapur

 ELSS are mutual fund schemes. So you can get it from any mutual fund distributor in your locality. Banks are also selling mutual fund products these days. 

 Refund funda

 I invested in MKVDC bonds in 1996 and the same has matured last year. The corporation has deducted Rs 2,040 as tax at source despite my filing Form 15H along with the redemption application form. I am a senior citizen and have no taxable income. Can I get back the tax deducted?

 N. Seal, Guwahati

 Had the corporation got your redemption application form along with Form 15H before the date on which the interest had to be credited in your name, that is the date of maturity of the bonds, they should not have deducted the tax at source. Presumably, they had not received the same. However, you can ask them to give you the TDS certificate and you can furnish the same with your tax return for the assessment year 2007-08 and claim the refund of the tax.

 Showing your cards

 I am 85 years old. I have investments in shares and bank fixed deposits. If I have to show all my dividends and interest income, how can I show my bank transactions? How should I treat the bonus shares that I have received? Do I have to include the sale proceeds of shares?

 S.K. Sircar, Howrah

 You will have to file income tax returns for the assessment year 2007-08 if your total income exceeds Rs 1,85,000 crore during financial year 2006-07. If you have received dividend income from shares, you dont have to show this in your tax return as dividends by companies are tax-free in the hands of shareholders. Otherwise, you will have to include it. In case of bank transactions, you will have to mention the annual interest you have received from those deposits during the year. If the bank has deducted any tax at source, you should attach a copy of the TDS certificate with your return and calculate the amount that remains to be paid. The sale of shares will come under the capital gains tax head. If you have paid the security transaction tax on purchase and sale of those shares and if these were held for more than 12 months, you dont have to pay any tax. 

 If you have any queries about investing or taxes or a high-cost purchase you are planning, mail to: btgraphabpmail.com, or write to: Business Telegraph, 6 Prafulla Sarkar Street, Calcutta 700 001.

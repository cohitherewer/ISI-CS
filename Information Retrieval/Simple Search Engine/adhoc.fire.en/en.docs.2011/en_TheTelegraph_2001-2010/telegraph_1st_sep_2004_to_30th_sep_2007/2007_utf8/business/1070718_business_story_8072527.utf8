 CII lobbies for lower rates

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, July 17: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) wants interest rates to soften. 

 Interest rates are at a peak and they need to move down, CII vice-president K.V. Kamath said here today after the National Council meeting of the industry body.

 The CII is optimistic of a growth rate of 9.20 per cent in the current fiscal (2007-08). 

 There is some pressure on industrys margins this year because of factors like rising input costs, but there is no question of a slowdown in the economy, CII president Sunil Bharti Mittal said. 

 According to Kamath, there will be a slowdown in the first quarter in some consumer segments because of the current interest rates, but he ruled out a slowdown in the overall economy.

 I see this trend as part of the adjustment process, Kamath, who is also the managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank, said.

 However, the overall liquidity position in the system is comfortable and if the interest rate softens, it will offset the apparent slowdown in some segments, he added.

 Insurer charts investment plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 14: The LIC is planning to invest Rs 1.15 lakh crore in the current fiscal, with 10 per cent of the sum likely to flow into equities.

 Last year, the corporation invested around Rs 13,000 crore in equities. With popularity of Ulips remaining strong, it is expected that the LIC will put more money into equities. The life insurer has put around 50 per cent of its assets in central government securities.

 Speaking to journalists here today after announcing the valuation results for 2006-07, LIC chairman T. S. Vijayan said investments would depend on preferences of policy-holders. 

 He said that in Ulips there are four equity-linked schemes the insurer in some funds invested 80 per cent of its corpus in shares. Total investments as on March 31, 2007 stood at Rs 6.1 lakh crore, of which equity and preference shares account for Rs 1.2 lakh crore.

 Vijayan said the insurer would roll out its credit card business in the next seven months and was also in an advanced stage of launching a health insurance product.

 The LIC, which has formed a separate company for the credit card business, has just signed the joint venture agreements with GE Money and Corporation Bank.

 LIC Housing Finance and LIC Mutual Fund are the other partners and 14 per cent stake will be shared by financial investors, Vijayan said.

 It is also strengthening its IT platform, with plans being drawn up to move towards a paperless system and payments through mobile phones.

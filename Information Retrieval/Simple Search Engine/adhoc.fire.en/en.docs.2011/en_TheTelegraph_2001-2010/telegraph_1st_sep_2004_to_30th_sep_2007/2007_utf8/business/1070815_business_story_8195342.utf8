 Chennai court holds out hope for Dunlop

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 14: A Chennai district court has ordered a status quo on the contentious sale of land by the erstwhile Chhabria management of Dunlop to a real estate developer. This gives the ailing tyremaker hope to fight the land grab that has stalled work at the Ambattur unit.

 The executive magistrate and revenue district officer of Ponneri, M.S. Sangeeta, in an interim order said, The impunged land should be placed in as-is-where-is condition without any change, construction, removal of machinery or apparatus and status quo should be maintained.

 The interim order passed on Saturday seems to have upheld the argument of the present Dunlop management, led by Pawan K. Ruia, that the sale of 60.86 acres to VGN Enterprises in 2004 for Rs 24.34 crore was illegal.

 The case was filed by the deputy commissioner of police (Ambattur range) on the basis of an FIR by Dunlop after VGN stormed the factory by pulling down a wall and erected its own with the complicity of a section of Dunlop employees, acquiring eight acres of the plant area.

 The attack was a setback to the revival of the company, which is struggling to get back to regular production at Ambattur and Sahagunj in Bengal.

 Initially, Dunlop argued that the BIFR only approved the sale of unused land and thus the eight acres within the existing factory premises was bad in law. It later hardened its stance and said the entire sale was illegal as a prior permission was not taken from the Tamil Nadu government.

 Today, the court vindicated the stand of the Ruia management.

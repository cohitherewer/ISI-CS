 PMO in Posco project push

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Patnaik: Action time

 New Delhi, April 18: The Union government is making a fresh bid to get the Posco steel project in Orissa off the ground.

 The Prime Ministers Office (PMO) has called a meeting to discuss the problems regarding acquisition of land, which has become the biggest stumbling block for the South Korean steel company. The meeting is also expected to discuss the tiff between state-run companies such as Kudremukh Iron and the Orissa government over mining leases.

 Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik may attend the meeting, where top brass from the PMO, mines and steel ministries will be present. The irony of the whole initiative is that while the Centre, on the one hand, is trying to help Posco out, on the other, it is fighting with the Orissa government for control of valuable iron ore mines. The state is too eager to hand out these mines to Posco.

 Steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan has already asked the mines ministry to allot Khandadhar mines to Kudremukh Iron Ore Company. The Orissa government wants to reserve the prospecting licence of these mines for Posco and the mines ministry is studying a proposal on this. Paswans point is that KIOCL, which is under his ministry, has already prospected the Khandadhar mining area and, under the mines act, the company has a preferential right to the allotment of mining lease.

 Kudremukh needs to get the Khandadhar mines to stay alive as a Supreme Court order has brought to a halt its mining activity in Karnataka. 

 The Posco project has long been hanging fire and attracting controversy. The Left parties had opposed the project, arguing that iron is a scarce resource and it should be conserved for local firms which are expanding at a fast pace. 

 However, the PMO had argued that Poscos investment being one of the largest ever that had come to India should be welcomed and given priority. Hence the attempt to sort out problems, including those on land acquisition and mine allocation.

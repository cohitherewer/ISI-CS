 Q amp;A

 Tax calculation

 I get a family pension of Rs 1 lakh per annum. My annual interest income from bank and post office deposits is Rs 70,000. I contribute Rs 60,000 every year towards PPF. What will be my tax liability in the assessment year 2007-08?

 Mrs M. Mazumdar, Calcutta

 The threshold exemption limit of annual income for income tax for women below 65 years is Rs 1,35,000. On top of it, one can claim a further deduction of Rs 1 lakh by investing in specified tax saving instruments. Your annual income from pension and interest is Rs 1,70,000. But since you contribute Rs 60,000 every year in PPF, there will be no income tax liability on you for the assessment year 2007-08. However, you will have to file income tax return for the assessment period.

 LIC policy

 I have invested Rs 40,000 in LIC Market Plus scheme. Is the investment admissible for deduction under section 80C of the income tax act? Will the maturity amount be taxable?

 Sahdeo Pandey, Calcutta

 Market Plus is a unit-linked scheme that combines both a life insurance and a pension plan. However, for tax purposes, investments in unit-linked life insurance or pension plans are eligible for deduction up to a maximum of Rs 1 lakh under section 80 C of the income tax act. The maturity amount of life insurance policies as of now is not taxed in the hands of the policyholders. 

 PAN card

 I had opened a post office MIS account in 2004 and my yearly interest income is Rs 20,000. Subsequently, I purchased two Kisan Vikas Patras of Rs 20,000 each in November 2005. Now I want to open a PPF account that requires a PAN card. Is it compulsory to file income tax returns to obtain a PAN card? My total annual income is Rs 80,000.

 Saibal Sarkar, Calcutta

 g income tax return is voluntary for those having non-taxable income. It is also not necessary that one needs to file income tax returns in order to have a PAN. So, you can apply for a PAN and can file income tax returns, though your annual income is below the basic exemption limit.

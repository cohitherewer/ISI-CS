 Insurance cop seeks recast of commissions

 ANIRUDH LASKAR

 Mumbai, Sept. 9: Insurance agents may have reason to worry: their wallets may turn somewhat lighter.

 The insurance regulator intends to take a long and hard look at the practice of heavily front-loading the commission that agents earn on the policies they sell.

 The Insurance and Regulatory Authority of India (IRDA) has expressed the need to review and bring about some changes in the structure of the commission that is paid to the agents for selling life policies.

 The IRDA has said instead of paying a substantial commission to the agent in the first year, the payment should be made more flexible and spread out evenly over more years.

 Under the insurance act, an insurer is allowed to pay as much as 40 per cent commission to the agent in the first year of the policy, a maximum of 7.5 per cent each for the next two years, and a maximum of 5 per cent every year thereafter till the policyholder dies or the total amount of commission adds up to 65 per cent, whichever is earlier.

 The regulator now feels that the commission should be paid in a more uniform manner over a period of time and head off the problem of lapsed policies in the early years.

 Many blame the problem of lapsed policies on the fact that agents are disincentivised to chase down policyholders to renew their premia after the first year. 

 The idea is to try to graduate the commission payout over the first three to five years to ensure greater agent and customer contact and avoid the problem of early lapses.

 According to rules, if a policy lapses, the agent who has sold the policy forfeits his commission for that year. If the commission in the first year is reduced and raised for the subsequent years, an agent would put in more effort to ensure that his policyholders pay their premium on time.

 According to the law, we cannot decrease the maximum amount that is stipulated as commission for the agents. But we certainly believe that the structure of payment should be made more flexible. We are more concerned about the structure of those insurance products where investments are also attached, IRDA chairman C. S. Rao told The Telegraph .

 We have seen an overall lapse of about 30 per cent in policies over the past year in the industry. I certainly believe that the government should bring about some amendments to allow us to make changes in the structure of the agents commission to help the insurance industry avoid the problem of lapsed policies. But to stop lapses completely, the insurance companies also have an important role to play; after all it is their business to collect premia on time, Rao added. 

 We completely agree with the IRDA as it would help insurers differentiate between a good agent and a bad one. There are only a few agents who keep in touch with the policyholder after the insurer pays the maximum portion of his commission in the first year itself. We have had several committee meetings on this issue and would welcome the required changes made by the regulator, said S.V. Mony, secretary general of Life Insurance Council of India.

 There are over 20 lakh insurance agents across the country. Many have turned it into a lucrative career option. Over the past year, the insurance agents have earned about Rs 15,000 crore as their commission.

 Pier-Paolo Dipaola, deputy CEO at SBI Life Insurance, said, If the commission for the first year is reduced and the amount is spread over a longer period, the agents would be assured of a sustained income over a longer period of time.

 In another development, the IRDA chairman said the regulator is also in the process of examining unit-linked insurance products (Ulips) closely. To prevent mis-selling of Ulips, we believe there should be greater disclosures to the policyholders. We are also planning to start a certification process for agents, which will ensure that the policyholder clearly understands the nature of his investment before opting for it, Rao said.

 We have created a small group within the regulatory body which will prepare a set of questions that the agents would have to ask the policyholders before selling it, Rao added.

 MoU for third semiconductor plant

 New Delhi, March 28: Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (HSMC) has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with German firm Infineon to set up a semiconductor manufacturing plant in India. HSMC will invest $4 billion for the project. This will be the countrys third semiconductor plant. 

 HSMC, a consortium founded by a group of overseas Indians led by Deven Verma, will start the project with two foundries and would later scale it up to 10. The German firm will not have any equity interest in the company. 

 The move comes in the wake of the Union government announcing the chip policy, which gives tax sops to companies setting up chip fabrication units or fabs to boost investments in the semiconductor industry. 

 India wants to woo infotech and telecom hardware makers as it feels the need to concentrate in this area after having turned into a major software producing nation. 

 The countrys share in the global semiconductor market is negligible at present, but this project will help it make a mark in production of high-tech chips, said HSMC chairman Deven Verma.

 Raj Khare, chairman of the Bangalore-based India Semiconductor Association (ISA), said apart from multinational companies, large Indian conglomerates may also decide to invest in fabs because of the huge potential here.

 A study by analyst firm Frost amp; Sullivan in February 2006 said the Indian electronics industry will grow to $360 billion by 2015, with the chip sector being worth $35 billion to $40 billion. 

 The demand for semiconductors is projected to reach $36 billion by 2015, riding on the booming electronic goods manufacturing sector in India. We need the fabrication industry to complete the semiconductor ecosystem, said Dayanidhi Maran, minister for communication and information technology.

 India has only a couple of government-owned fabs that cater to the defence sector. These are SemIndias $3-billion fab unit in Hyderabad, which is being set up in collaboration with Advanced Micro Devices, the worlds second-largest chip maker. 

 Nano-Tech Silicon India (NeST) is also keen to set up a fab in the country.

 Verma said negotiations are on with state governments which are eager to have a facility that can catapult them into a top manufacturing region in India.

 The first fab will require an investment of $1 billion to produce chips on 8-inch wafers. The second fab will be for the more advanced 12-inch wafers requiring an investment of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion, said Verma.

 The semiconductors manufactured would be used in mobile phones, SIM cards, smart cards and automotive cards, said Verma, adding that the first products from HSMC are expected within two years.

 Infineon and HSMC would file their formal proposal to the government in the next four to five weeks for the final approval.

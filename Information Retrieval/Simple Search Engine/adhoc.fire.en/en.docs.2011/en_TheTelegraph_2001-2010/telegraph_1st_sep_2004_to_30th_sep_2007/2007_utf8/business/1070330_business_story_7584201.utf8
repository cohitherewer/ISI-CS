 Coal prices set to go up

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, March 29: Coal prices may go up soon. Coal India Ltd (CIL) is planning to increase the price by 9 per cent, according to D. Chakravarti, chairman-cum-managing director of Eastern Coalfields, a CIL subsidiary.

 Coal prices have not been revised for long and our cost of production has gone up significantly in the meantime, Chakravarti said. 

 Chakravarti added that the hike in price would, however, depend on the outcome of the move undertaken by CIL to reclassify its core and non-core customers and implement a suitable e-booking mechanism for the sale of the mineral. 

 Initially, there was a move to hike coal prices from November but it was postponed, Chakravarti said.

 At present, we are trying to implement a suitable e-booking model for coal sale. Besides, CIL has also mooted a proposal to reclassify its core and non-core customers. Once these things are in place, price of coal will be adjusted accordingly, Chakravarti added.

 CILs core customers are power manufacturers, fertiliser companies and cement makers. 

 Of these, only cement manufacturers have not followed any notified price mechanism for their produce and raised cement prices as and when they wanted, Chakravarti said.

 Our argument is that as cement manufacturers dont follow a notified price mechanism, they should not get coal at the notified price announced by CIL for its core customers. In other words, cement manufacturers should be reclassified as non-core customers and they should get coal at the price (notified price plus a 30 per cent premium) specified for that category. The proposal will be sent to the government for its consideration and, if not approved, coal prices may be revised upwards for all category of customers, Chakravarti explained.

 CIL had last raised its prices for non-coking coal in 2004 by 16.7 per cent.

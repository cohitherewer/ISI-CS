 Owners wary before tea garden reopening

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

Calcutta, June 24: .P. Agarwal, who is set to buy the Bharnobari tea estate, is unsure of reopening the garden because of outstanding dues and excess workers. This is one of the two closed gardens that are scheduled to reopen on June 29 in the presence of the minister of state for commerce, Jairam Ramesh. The other garden is the Red Bank, owned by Robin Pal.

 Pal, who also reopened the Surendranagar garden in the state, was recently attacked by 200 to 300 Citu workers on a visit to the Red Bank. However, he is optimistic of reopening the garden on time.

 According to Pal, the trouble was created to show law and order problems where none exist. 

 Most of the workers want me to start operations. The disruption was just to create problems to prevent Ramesh from visiting this garden on June 29, Pal added.

 Rameshs last visit was cancelled because of security concerns.

 I have reopened my other garden, which Ramesh is scheduled to visit, and will also reopen Red Bank, said Pal.

 Agarwal, who is also the chairman of Ambo Exports Ltd, said, The situation at the Bharnobari estate is under survey and we will get a full report. There are dues of agricultural cess amounting to Rs 2.5 crore, provident fund worth Rs 2.3 crore, labour costs of Rs 1.7 crore and a litigation involving electricity dues worth Rs 1.3 crore.

 We are trying to help the government and the Tea Board by taking over the garden but cannot do so at the cost of our business. It will take at least three to four years to nurse the garden back to health, he added.

 Agarwal and other private players are awaiting schemes from the state government that will make investment in closed gardens more attractive.

 Ambo Exports wants the continuation of the monthly allowance of Rs 750 to workers from the state government and a small amount of ration till the garden is brought back to health.

 Agarwal, who exported around 25 million kg tea last year, said Bharnobari had 2,200 workers, while the requirement was for 1,400 only.

 Who will bear the cost of the extra 800 workers and why will anyone do so? Agarwal asked. Ramesh was disappointed that only one garden opened in Bengal vis--vis seven in Kerala.

 Instead of invoking section 16 (D) of the Tea Act of 1953, the government should look at providing more benefits to owners to reopen their gardens, Pal said. Section 16 (D) of the Tea Act enables the Centre to recommend the Tea Board to take over the management of a closed garden.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Hindujas in makeover mode

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Raha: Planning ahead

 Calcutta , Sept. 7: The Hinduja group is planning to tap new sectors in the country as part of a recast exercise.

 The restructuring is expected to be over in 3-4 months, according to Subir Raha, executive vice-chairman of Hinduja Group India Ltd (HGIL).

 The group believes that there is far more potential than what has been achieved so far, Raha, who was earlier chairman and managing director of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, said. He was speaking to journalists on the sidelines of the 34th national convention of the All India Management Association and the Asian Association of Management Organisations here today.

 Ashok Leyland, the Chennai-based commercial vehicle maker, is the flagship company of the group. Other areas of operations include banking and finance through IndusInd Bank, BPO (HTMT Global Solutions), cable and entertainment (Hinduja TMT, In2cable amp; In Network) and oil (Gulf Oil). 

 On the drawing board is a new brand identity for the group. HGIL, which represents promoters interest in the group companies in the country, is also set to play a bigger role in decision making. 

 HGIL manages treasury, human resources and IT systems. It also monitors corporate activities and incubates new businesses. 

 Raha said the group would foray into healthcare and real estate. We are sitting on 1,000 acres of land in metro areas. It is a great asset to leverage. 

 In health, the plan is to set up a network of hospitals and other facilities in the country. Work on the first such hospital has started at Khar, Mumbai. The Hindujas have a hospital in Mumbai, but it operates on a no-profit-no-loss basis.

 In banking, the group is exploring synergies between IndusInd Bank and its Geneva-headquartered Amas bank. We will see how to derive more synergy, Raha said. 

 There are plans for restructuring in power as well. The wind power business could be transferred from Ashok Leyland to Hinduja National Power Company Ltd. 

 Gulf Oil, too, may diversify, from lubricants to other areas in oil and gas.

 Raha said the joint venture between Ashok Leyland and Japans Nissan Motor in light commercial vehicles was expected to begin operations this year.

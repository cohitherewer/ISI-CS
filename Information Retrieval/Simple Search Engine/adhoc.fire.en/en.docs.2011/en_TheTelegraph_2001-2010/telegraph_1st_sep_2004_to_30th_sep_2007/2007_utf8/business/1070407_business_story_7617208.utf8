 Calcutta, April 6: Engineering exports have met the target of $24 billion set for the last fiscal. The segment has overtaken gems and jewellery to become the highest export earner in the last two years. 

 EEPC chairman Rakesh Shah said the target was reached despite it being revised by $1 billion in the mid-term review. We are very glad that we can now claim to have achieved the target set for 2006-07. We hope to better it significantly for this fiscal, Shah said. He was speaking at a seminar of EEPC on cluster development programme for small scale industries.

 Shah said even in 2005-06 the target was revised to $18 billion from $17.2 billion, and the sector earned $20.3 billion compared with $16.2 billion in 2004-05.

 Shah said this was good going for a sector, which according to a study by AF Ferguson is expected to earn $27.4 billion by 2009-10.

 The engineering industry accounts for 10 to 12 per cent of Indias gross domestic product and 30.6 per cent share in the countrys employment.

 Cluster plan

 EEPC will in the course of the next five weeks submit a proposal on the development of the castings and foundry industry of Howrah in a cluster format to the state governments directorate of cottage and small scale industry which will send it for the Centres approval.

 EEPC proposes to bring 100 units within the cluster.

 These units are not part of the foundry park which is being set up in the same area by the Indian Foundry Association. Shah said the investment would depend on the scale of the common facility, which will have the physical laboratory, radiation checks and other facilities.

 He said the estimated investment was Rs 5 crore to be funded 60 per cent by the Centre, 30 per cent by the foundry owners and 10 per cent by the state government. 

 The technology is from Pum NI, a Dutch NGO.

 EEPC has formed a committee to implement the Centres proposal to split up Howrah into regions for cluster development.

 If the proposal is successful in Howrah, EEPC plans to take the model to other cities such as Ludhiana for its bicycles, Chennai for auto components and Rajkot for combustion engines.

 Shah also stated that he was given to understand that the Centre was toying with the idea of forming growth poles to streamline policies and procedures guiding the management of micro and small enterprises. The concept involves the integration of a number of clusters of small and micro enterprises engaged in similar activities across the country.

 Jawhar Sircar, additional secretary and development commissioner, SSI, govenment of India, also pointed out that a major step forward for the small scale industry would be the proposal expected soon from NSE with Sebi approval to create a separate trading platform for the SSI and SMEs.

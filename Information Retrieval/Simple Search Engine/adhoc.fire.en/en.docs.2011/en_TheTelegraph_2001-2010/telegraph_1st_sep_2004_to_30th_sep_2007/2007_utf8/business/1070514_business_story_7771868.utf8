 PSUs go slow on cooking gas 

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, May 13: Oil companies have put the brakes on their plans for cooking gas (LPG) because of high prices of crude and subsidies on sale of the gas. The price of the Indian basket of crude in this fiscal is $65.38 per barrel compared with $62.46 a year ago.

 The subsidy on an LPG cylinder has also gone up in this fiscal. The price of the cylinder is Rs 167 less than the cost incurred by the PSUs. The subsidy is shared not only by the marketing PSUs Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum but also by the upstream PSUs, ONGC, Oil India (OIL) and GAIL (India).

 GAIL has reported a profit before tax for the financial year ended March 31, 2007, which is lower than the profit earned a year ago. OIL also expects its profit to fall in the last fiscal, unless the government waives the Rs 200 crore it incurs yearly on relief to Indian Oil and Bharat Petroleum.

 The high subsidy on the cylinder has forced the ONGC and GAIL to put on hold their plans to market the gas. 

 The duo sells the gas to the marketing PSUs and even have the permission from the oil and gas ministry to market the gas. Cooking gas consumption in 2006-07 was around 10.9 million tonnes, of which 8.5mt was produced at home and 2.4mt imported.

 The Reliance Industriess refinery at Jamnagar produces 2.9mt while the rest of the domestic output comes from the PSUs. 

 The average price of the imported gas during 2006-07, excluding shipping charges, was $500 per tonne, saddling the oil companies with a bill of $1.2 billion.

 Private companies such as Reliance get import parity price on the gas. This includes ocean freight, insurance and port charges. The average domestic price paid by the marketing PSUs to these private firms works out to Rs 24,313 per tonne. 

 The marketing PSUs supply the gas to 94 million households, mainly in the metros and big towns. Maharashtra has the largest number of households using the gas, followed by Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat, Kerala and Bengal.

 The PSUs have 9,363 LPG distributors. UP has the largest number of distributors because of its vast size.

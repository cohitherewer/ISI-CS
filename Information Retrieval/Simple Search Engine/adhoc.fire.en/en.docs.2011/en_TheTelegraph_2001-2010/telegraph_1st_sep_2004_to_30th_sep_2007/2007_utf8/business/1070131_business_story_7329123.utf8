To achieve this, the two companies will merge in the next three to four months. The work is on, a senior company official told The Telegraph.

 The company has posted a net profit of Rs 2.37 crore for the quarter ended December 31 against Rs 1.18 crore in the same quarter of the previous year. 

 Usha International has hired McKinsey and Company to chart out its growth strategy. 

 They will help us re-engineer our growth plans for the next five to 10 years, suggest areas that we need to work on ... we expect our market share to go up significantly in the next three years, said Usha International chairman Siddharth Shriram. 

 The company enjoys a 20 per cent market share. Its main competitors are Orient Fans, Crompton amp; Greaves, Bajaj Electricals and Khaitan. Usha International hopes to clock Rs 700 crore turnover in the current fiscal and Rs 1,000 crore by the end of 2008.

 The company aims at capturing markets in the US, Europe and West Asia. Shriram said, At present, 10-15 per cent of our revenues come from exports. In the next two to three years, it will go up to 30-35 per cent. 

 Jay Engineering manufactures fans for Usha International at its two plants in Calcutta and Hyderabad. It produces 1.5 lakh fans per month, which can be expanded to 3 lakh units. Usha International outsources another 1.5 lakh fans per month from its vendors and imports from the US and China.

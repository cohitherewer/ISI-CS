 Plan it right 

 Budget 2007 introduced some changes in personal tax. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay tells you how to reap the benefits of tax sops and lower your outgo

Its time for some tax tweaking again. Budget 2007-08 has a few proposals pertaining to personal income tax. This means, you need to plan your taxes a bit differently.

 What has changed?

 The annual income threshold for individuals and Hindu undivided family for tax liability has been raised to Rs 1,10,000 from Rs 1,00,000. 

 The education cess has been increased to 3 per cent. 

 Deduction on mediclaim premium has been increased to Rs 20,000 for senior citizens and to Rs 15,000 for others. 

 You can claim deduction under section 80E on the interest payment for an education loan taken either for yourself, your spouse or children. However, no deduction on principal payment. 

 The interest income from bank or post office deposits up to Rs 10,000 a year per branch will not attract any TDS. 

 And the effect?

 While the increase in the exemption limit lowers the tax liability for all income slabs, the hike in education cess eats into the benefit and actually raises the tax burden for those who have an annual income upwards of Rs 5,10,000. However, people above 65 years and having an annual income of less than Rs 9 lakh will pay less tax in 2007-08 than now. 

 What now?

 The finance minister has not tinkered with the deductions available on investments under section 80C. So you can claim a maximum deduction of Rs 1 lakh by invesing in Public Provident Fund, National Savings Certificate, tax-saving fixed deposits of banks, equity-linked savings schemes of mutual funds, life insurance premium and premium for a pension plan. Barring the ELSS and ULIPs, other tax-saving schemes give a lower return when compared with other taxable investments. 

 Banks pay more

 Banks are now offering an interest rate as high as 9.5 per cent on their regular fixed deposits of three to four years, while the interest rate on their five-year tax-saving deposits varies between 8.5 per cent and 8.75 per cent. If you invest in PPF or NSC, you will get a lower interest rate of 8 per cent and you will have to lock in your funds for a longer period. 

 Therefore, you are not only losing out on returns but will also have to invest Rs 1 lakh every year to claim tax deduction. To save Rs 30,600 (if you are in the 30 per cent bracket) tax, you will have to fork out Rs 1 lakh every year for at least five years if you choose to invest in assured income assets. 

 Now that the finance minister has proposed to double the limit for TDS on interest payment by banks and post offices, you can take benefit of this provision to earn a higher return on your investment. 

 Lets explain this. Suppose your annual income is Rs 4 lakh. Your current income tax liability is Rs 71,400. By investing Rs 1 lakh under section 80C, you can bring down your tax burden to Rs 40,800. 

 In the next financial year, your income tax liability will be Rs 71,070. Now, instead of investing Rs 1 lakh in different tax saving instruments, invest Rs 1,00,146 in a regular bank fixed deposit that is giving a 9.5 per cent interest per annum for a three-year maturity. Your cumulative interest after a year will amount to Rs 10,000. Take out this amount at the end of the year and put it in an ELSS or buy a life insurance policy and claim a deduction under section 80C. You can also buy a mediclaim with this and claim deduction under section 80D.

 Tax implication?

 You will have to show the interest of Rs 10,000 as income from other sources in your tax return. At the same time, you claim a deduction of Rs 10,000 from your total income of Rs 4,10,000 under section 80C or 80D as the case may be. 

 It thus reduces your tax saving investment requirement to Rs 90,000 for at least three years since during these years you will be getting an annual interest income of Rs 10,000 from the fixed deposit.

 The whole exercise, however, will increase your tax liability next year by Rs 2,460. At the same time, you can save Rs 10,000 every year from investing in tax saving instruments to claim the Rs 1 lakh deduction under section 80C. 

 Thus you can effectively reduce the tax rate on your interest income from taxable deposits in banks and post offices to 24.60 per cent from 30.6 per cent, which is your income tax rate. 

 You can open more such fixed deposit accounts, but do it with different banks or different branches of the same bank to save the deduction of tax (on interest income) at source.

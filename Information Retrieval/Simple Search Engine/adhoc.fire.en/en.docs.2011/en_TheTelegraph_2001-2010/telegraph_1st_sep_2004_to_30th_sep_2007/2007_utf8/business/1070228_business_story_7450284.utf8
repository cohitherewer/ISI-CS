 FDI impact on retail under study

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Nath: Probing deep

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: Commerce minister Kamal Nath today said the government has commissioned a study on the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) and big corporate investments in the retail sector. The move has been initiated by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi. 

 I have asked the Indian Council of Research in International Economic Relations (ICRIER) to do a holistic study to determine the impact of big investment from the organised sector, including FDI, in retail on not only small shops, but also on other segments, the minister said.

 He said the ICRIER would submit its report in the next three to four months. Earlier this month, Congress president Sonia Gandhi had written to the Prime Minister on the need for a careful study of the impact of transnational supermarkets and big corporates on the livelihood of small-scale retailers and vendors.

 The Prime Ministers office had in turn asked the commerce ministry to look into the issue and keep the Wal-Mart clearance on hold.

 Nath, who is a strong proponent of FDI, said the study would not only limit itself to the impact on small players but would cover consumers, suppliers and look into whether any dislocation would be caused as a result of such investment.

 It would deal with the issue of big versus small and not just FDI, he said.

 Nath said the ministrys proposal to open foreign investment in electronics and sports goods could be delayed till the report is received. 

 In an earlier study, ICRIER was in favour of FDI in retail. It advocated opening up of retail to FDI, though in a phased manner over a 3-5 year period. 

 ICRIER had recommended that at least 49 per cent FDI be allowed in the retail industry initially. Since the sector is highly fragmented and domestic retailers are consolidating their position, the process should be gradual. 

 Dismissing the fears of many Indian retailers of the loss of a level-playing field if foreign retail giants set up shop in India, ICRIER director Arvind Virmani stated opening up the sector to foreign investment would actually help the existing retailers on several fronts. Further, the study claimed that even though there are apprehensions among organised retailers that foreign retailers would drive them and unorganised retailers out of business, about 48 per cent of the unorganised retailers felt that the impact of foreign entrants on their business would be the same as that of growth in domestic organised retailers.

 Calcutta, April 18: SBI Life Insurance Company, a joint venture between the State Bank of India and Cardiff SA of France, will focus on rural and semi-urban markets through tieups with rural banks. 

 Last year, we signed MoUs with five cooperative banks, but they could generate only Rs 25 crore premium for us. The premium income was low because the banks were selling insurance products for the first time. This financial year, we expect to generate a business of around Rs 100 crore from these partners, said Uday Shankar Roy, managing director and chief executive officer of SBI Life. 

 Roy said the insurer plans to enter into similar arrangements with regional rural banks to sell its products. SBI sponsors 30 regional rural banks, which operate in 102 districts across 16 states. These RRBs have 2,336 branches, accounting for 16 per cent of SBIs branches. Around 2,020 of these branches are in remote areas.

 We are waiting for the consolidation of RRBs. We will then enter into bancassurance arrangements with them, Roy said. 

 SBI Life will also introduce a micro-insurance product in three to four months, Roy added.

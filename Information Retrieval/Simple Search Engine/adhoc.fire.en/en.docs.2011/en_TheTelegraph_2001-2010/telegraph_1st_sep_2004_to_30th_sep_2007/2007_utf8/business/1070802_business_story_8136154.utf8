 PTC eyes overseas coal mines

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Powering ahead

 Calcutta, Aug. 1: PTC India Ltd, formerly known as the Power Trading Corporation of India, is considering equity investments in overseas coal mining companies as part of its strategy to ensure fuel supply for its clients generating thermal power.

 We will approach the fuel linkage business based on imported coal in two ways. One is by entering into a long-term coal supply agreement with miners abroad and the second by picking up stakes in foreign mining companies, said Deepak Amitabh, executive vice-president and chief financial officer of PTC India.

 While our board of directors has already approved the proposal to enter into a long-term coal supply agreement, it is conducting due diligence on equity investments in overseas coal companies, he added.

 The PTC board has agreed in principle to the proposal of picking up stakes in overseas coal projects. It is, however, yet to approve the final guidelines on the amount PTC will earmark for such investments and the stake it will pick up in each company.

 We are looking at companies in Indonesia. We will invest in three to four companies there. The investments will be made in greenfield projects, Amitabh said. Besides short-term trading in electricity, PTC is signing long-term power purchase agreements with individual power producers (IPPs). These IPPs need assured supply of coal to generate thermal power uninterrupted. By entering into long-term supply contracts and investing in equities of mining companies overseas, we can ensure a steady supply to these IPPs, Amitabh added.

 Mahindra truck unit in two years

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 16: Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) will set up its medium and heavy commercial vehicles unit in alliance with International Truck and Engine Corporation in Maharashtra. The greenfield plant, which will also produce new generation vehicles, will entail an investment of up to Rs 2,500 crore.

 While production is expected to begin in two years, the initial capacity will be 2.50 lakh vehicles annually. Though the project site is yet to be finalised, it will come up near Pune. 

 Spread across 700 acres, the plant will also manufacture engines and other aggregates for the vehicles. It will produce a wide range of commercial vehicles and will include a cab assembly, vehicle assembly and paint shop. The vehicles will have 90 per cent local content.

 M amp;M formed a joint venture with International Truck around 18 months ago. The joint venture will produce a range of commercial trucks and buses. 

 Both the partners plan to launch a range of medium and heavy commercial vehicles based, in part, on International Trucks existing product line and adapted for the Indian market.

 The venture is also expected to export vehicles through its own distribution channel as well as the parent companies overseas networks.

 Last year, M amp;M said Renaults Logan will be produced at its Nashik facility. For this, it signed a Rs 550-crore MoU with the Maharashtra government. The company will also make its multi-purpose vehicle the Ingenio in the state.

 Anand Mahindra, vice-chairman and managing director of M amp;M, said the Pune unit was significant not only because of the investment involved, but also due to the multiplier effect it would create in terms of demand for parts and auto components.

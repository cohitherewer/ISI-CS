 Crisil caveat on mergers

 Mumbai, June 17 (PTI): India Incs growing appetite for large global merger and acquisition deals can damage the corporate credit quality with high debts on balance sheets, rating agency Crisil said.

 While large-scale acquisitions tend to have a positive bearing on the business risk profile of entities, the incremental debt required to finance the transaction tends to weigh heavily on the financial profile of the combined entity, a Crisil research paper said.

 Indian companies have surged ahead on M amp;A deals in the first two months of 2007; the volumes in dollar terms have eclipsed those of Chinese firms. Given the ambitious deal sizes, and increasing levels of debt funding and valuations, the credit profiles of companies may be affected, the paper said.

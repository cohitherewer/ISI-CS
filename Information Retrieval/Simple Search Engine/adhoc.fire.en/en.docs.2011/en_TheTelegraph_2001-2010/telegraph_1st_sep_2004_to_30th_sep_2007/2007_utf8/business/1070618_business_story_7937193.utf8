 Stage set for trade pact with Canada

 Toronto, June 17 (PTI): India and Canada have concluded negotiations on a Foreign Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement that will safeguard investors rights in the two countries and boost bilateral economic ties.

 The announcement was made by commerce minister Kamal Nath and Canadian minister of international trade David Emerson here today.

 Nath said the agreement, which is expected to be signed soon, would promote economic relations between the two countries and accelerate two-way investments.

 The agreement, designed to protect investors by defining their legally binding rights and obligations, will give new impetus to Indo-Canada economic relations, he said.

 Emerson said the bilateral commercial ties could grow exponentially after the agreement. The deal would protect and promote two-way foreign investment and would stimulate trade and investment with India, he said.

 The agreement is intended to protect foreign investments against exportation or nationalisation, and improve access for Canadian firms in a rapidly growing Indian market, Emerson said. 

 He dismissed concerns that the deal would jeopardise the Canadian job market.

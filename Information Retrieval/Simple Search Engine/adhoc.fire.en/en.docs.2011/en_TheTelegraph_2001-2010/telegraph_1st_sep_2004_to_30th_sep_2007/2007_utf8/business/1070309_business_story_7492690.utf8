 Das Munshi: Glad tidings

 New Delhi, March 8: The Union cabinet today approved guidelines on corporate governance for both listed and unlisted central public sector enterprises, requiring all of them to have independent directors on their boards.

 According to the guidelines, the board of directors of the company will have an optimum combination of executive and non-executive directors, where at least 50 per cent should be non-executive directors.

 The number of independent directors will depend on whether the chairman is executive or non-executive.

 In case of a non-executive chairman, at least one-third of the board should comprise independent directors and in case of an executive chairman, it should be 50 per cent, said Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Union minister for information and broadcasting, after the cabinet meeting.

 According to the norms, an independent director would be one, who apart from receiving the directors remuneration, does not have any material pecuniary relationship or transactions with the company, promoters, management or subsidiaries.

 According to the norms, all pecuniary relationships or transactions of non-executive directors with the company should be disclosed in the annual report.

 The Securities and Exchange Board of India has since January 2006 enforced clause 49 of the Listing Agreement, requiring all listed companies to have independent directors on their boards.

 PCPIR policy

 In another decision, the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs approved a policy resolution for petroleum, chemicals and petrochemicals investment regions (PCPIRs).

 The policy aims to promote investment in this sector and make the country a hub for both domestic and international markets.

 This approach will create investment regions which will have excellent infrastructure. This will provide a competitive environment to set up businesses such as integrated petroleum, chemical and petrochemical complexes, said Union finance minister P. Chidambaram.

 Cutting-edge plan of steel leader

 AMIT ROY

 London, Sept. 11: ArcelorMittal, the worlds largest steel company, plans to raise production to 131 million tonnes by 2012. At present, it produces 118mt.

 CEO and president Lakshmi Mittal today told investors in Paris, The projection relates to organic growth only and does not include any current or future greenfield projects or potential growth through acquisition. 

 The growth will come largely from the companys low-cost operations in the developing markets, particularly in Latin America, Africa, eastern Europe and CIS countries, he said. 

 Mittal said, Demand for steel globally remains buoyant with world steel production expected to maintain a yearly growth rate of 3-5 per cent. 

 Considering our high exposure to developing markets and industrial leadership, we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities which will permit us to increase shipments from our existing operations by some 23 million tonnes by 2012. 

 This plan forms only one part of our three-dimensional growth strategy, which also focuses on value-added products and value chain growth (mining and distribution). 

 In 2006, China used 356.2 million tonnes of steel, while India consumed 43.1 million tonnes. 

 If Mittal sets up plants in India, his groups annual production could be even higher. 

 Growth in the West has been sluggish compared with China where consumption has been rising between 50mt and 80mt a year comparable with the annual production of either Arcelor or Mittal Steel before their merger in June last year. 

 The company today said, ArcelorMittal is the worlds number one steel company, with 320,000 employees in more than 60 countries. The company brings together the worlds number one and number two steel companies, Arcelor and Mittal Steel. 

 ArcelorMittal is the leader in all major global markets, including automotive, construction, household appliances and packaging, with leading R amp;D and technology, as well as sizeable captive supplies of raw materials and outstanding distribution networks. 

 An industrial presence in 27 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and America exposes the company to all the key steel markets. 

 With a production of 118mt and revenues of $88.6 billion in 2006, the company represented around 10 per cent of world steel output.

 Matsushita buys 80% of Anchor

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 23: Japans Matsushita Electric Works, which makes products under the National and Panasonic brands, has bought an 80 per cent stake in Anchor Electricals for Rs 2,000 crore. 

 We decided to partner Matsushita for its research and technological prowess. The deal would complement our brand value, network and product profile, Anchor managing director Atul Shah told reporters here today.

 The deal is the biggest in the electrical equipment sector involving an Indian firm. Early this year, Indias Havells acquired German company Sylvanias lighting business for about $300 million.

 Anchor board members will continue to hold the remaining 20 per cent in the company. A reconstituted board of Anchor will have six Matsushita officials, while four members of the Shah family the promoters of Anchor will be in the top management body. Matsushita expects to recover the investment in Anchor within seven years, Toshihide Arii, the new chairman of Anchor, said.

 The joint venture is expected to help Matsushita launch full-fledged operations in India. The company has a major share of the wiring devices market in Japan. It is also present in China, Taiwan, Korea and other Asean countries. After the acquisition, the Anchor brand name and logo will be retained. However, new products from the Matsushita stable could sport its name as well. 

 The deal will help Anchor double its turnover in four years. Anchors sales for the year ended March 31, 2007 were Rs 920 crore. We expect to double sales to Rs 1,800 crore by 2011 and grow 10 times in the next decade, Shah said.

 Matsushitas group sales for March 2006 were $13.73 billion, Arii said. 

 Following the acquisition of Anchor, Matsushitas market share in Asia will go up from 30.5 per cent to 36 per cent. Anchors market share in India is estimated to be 60 per cent.

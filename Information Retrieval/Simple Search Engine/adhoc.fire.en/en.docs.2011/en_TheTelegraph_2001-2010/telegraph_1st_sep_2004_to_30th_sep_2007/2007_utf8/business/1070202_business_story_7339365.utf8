 Bengal talks tough on Haldia Petro

 OUR BUREAU

Calcutta, Feb. 1: The Bengal government has upped the ante against Purnendu Chatterjee by demanding mega bucks for exiting the states showcase project, Haldia Petrochemical Ltd (HPL).

 State industry minister Nirupam Sen said the government wanted a revaluation of all the shares the Company Law Board (CLB) had directed it to transfer to Chatterjee yesterday.

 CLB said the government could sell its 520 million shares in HPL at a minimum of Rs 28.80 a share or at a price fixed by an independent valuer, whichever is higher. 

 Sens remark indicates that the government believes it will get a higher price for its stake than Rs 28.80.

 Given the performance of the company, it should be much higher, a source close to the government said. HPL is likely to post a profit after tax of around Rs 600 crore this fiscal.

 Sen also demanded fresh valuation for the 155 million shares of HPL which the government had transferred to The Chatterjee Group (TCG) earlier but received only a partial payment.

 This chunk of shares came to the government after the Tatas exited HPL. It was subsequently transferred to TCG at a par value of Rs 10.

 Chatterjee was to have bought these shares in 2005, but he didnt honour the commitment. Now when the value of these (155 million) shares has gone up, why should we sell them at old prices? Sen asked.

 CLB had upheld the transfer at Rs 10 yesterday.

 Given the onerous task of arranging Rs 1,500 crore to buy out the state government, the TCG camp has agreed to smoke the peace pipe.

 Admitting that there was little for them to feel happy about in the CLB verdict, the TCG camp hoped for an amicable solution to the stand-off. 

 Chatterjee needs government help to run the company even if he owns it fully, sources close to TCG said.

 Sen also demanded that the valuer for the shares of HPL be appointed by the state government and not CLB. CLB had said the valuer should be mutually agreeable to both the parties. The state government has to communicate its decision seeking valuer to CLB on February 20.

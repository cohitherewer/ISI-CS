 Banks log in to curb fraud

 TECH-TONIC SHIFT

 New Delhi, Sept. 23: Banks have joined hands with software companies to build alert systems for tracking suspicious transactions.

 Prakash P. Mallya, chairman and managing director of Vijaya Bank, said, We are fine-tuning the security system which can scan each transaction and an alert will be issued if it is found suspicious, said . 

 Vijaya Bank has tied up with Wipro Technologies to develop an early warning system to detect money laundering and dubious accounts. 

 Punjab National Bank (PNB) is also in talks with Tata Consultancy Services to develop an in-house software to track bad transactions. A senior PNB official said, If a customer can explain the discrepancy in a transaction to the financial intelligence unit, he will not be implicated.

 The finance ministry has asked banks to install software to track all transactions, so that suspicious dealings can be detected and reported to the financial intelligence unit.

 The financial intelligence unit is the nodal agency to disseminate information on fraud to enforcement agencies.

 Suspicious transactions are identified manually but there is a need to streamline the process to make it more efficient, said a government official. At times, intelligence agencies are unable to make much headway as the details do not reach them in time. Mallya said while manual detection was cumbersome and time consuming, software alerts could be sent immediately to the financial intelligence unit.

 According to software analysts, most new accounts are classified on the basis of the risk perception of the bank about the client. However, old accounts are not classified in this way. In such cases, the history of transactions becomes important. There are in-built alarm systems that warn of transactions inconsistent with the nature of the account. 

 It is mandatory for all banks to submit cash transaction reports to the financial intelligence unit. The reports have information on cash withdrawals and deposits above Rs 10 lakh. Around 13 lakh such transactions were tracked by banks last year. 

 Under the prevention of money laundering act, banks are required to maintain a record of cash transactions of above Rs 10 lakh, or equivalent foreign currency, and dealings where forged currency notes have been issued. 

 In April, the Reserve Bank notified that all scheduled commercial banks should implement better systems to track wire transfers. An efficient monitoring mechanism will help India become a member of the Financial Action Task Force the global body against money laundering.

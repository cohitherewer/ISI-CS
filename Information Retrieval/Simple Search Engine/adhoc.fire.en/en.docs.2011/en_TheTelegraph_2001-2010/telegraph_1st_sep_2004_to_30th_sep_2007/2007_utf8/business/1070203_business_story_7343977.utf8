 Strict vigil on realty funds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: Finance ministry officials feel there is considerable merit in RBIs opposition to foreign investment in realty through the FII route. It has, therefore, decided to oppose the move by certain sections of the government to push through a proposal in this regard.

 Worried over a real estate bubble, the RBI earlier this week raised the risk weightage on real estate loans of banks. The government and the RBI consider the more-than 100 per cent rise in loans to realty and the upswing in property prices alarming, necessitating restraint in the disbursal of funds to the sector.

 Though the ministry had taken the opinion of market regulator Sebi, it considers the views of the Reserve Bank equally important.

 The industry ministry pushed for a relaxation in foreign investment norms, putting forth the argument of the real estate industry, which pointed out that tough norms on foreign investment encouraged companies to shovel foreign investments into realty in the garb of FII funds. The norms on foreign direct investment are tough, leading to many instances of ineligibility, while they are comparatively easier for FIIs.

 Officials said even if FDI in realty is allowed through the FII route, the lock-in period for this would be the same three years as for FDI. We need to do this ... one has to understand that the South East Asian bubble had a large property component to it, they said. 

 Several leading real estate developers are coming out with initial public offers and follow-on public offers. Any decision on allowing FDI through the FII route would affect these offerings. Hence, the market has been closely following the discussions on this issue among various sections of the government.

 North Block, however, has set great store by the RBIs views on the issue. The apex bank had given a warning on the four-fold increase in FDI in just a year along with the rise in credit. 

 Large foreign investors in realty include Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs, Emmar Properties and GE Commercial Finance Real Estate.

 Studies by Assocham indicate that FDI as a proportion of investment in real estate could go up from 16 per cent in 2005-6 to 26 per cent in 2007.

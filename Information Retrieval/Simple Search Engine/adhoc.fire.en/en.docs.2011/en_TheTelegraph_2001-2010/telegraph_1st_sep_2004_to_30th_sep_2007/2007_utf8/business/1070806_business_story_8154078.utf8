 Choudhary: Big plans

 Calcutta, Aug. 5: Gati Limited plans to almost double its turnover to become a Rs 1,000-crore company by 2009.

 The logistics and freight company is looking at expanding operations in Southeast and East Asia.

 We expect our retail and air freighter business to contribute substantially to our revenues. Warehousing is another key area and we have 2.5 lakh sq ft space in Bangalore. Moreover, our 65 express distribution centres also have individual warehousing facilities, said Patram Choudhary, head of business operations (east).

 The company recently signed a wet lease agreement with Indian for five B737-200 freighter aircraft for five years. Gati will operate the cargo aircraft on various routes covering all the metros and other parts of the country, beginning July 2007. Air cargo contributes about 20 per cent to its turnover. 

 Gati is also closely watching the progress of the Nathula trade talks as it has a joint venture agreement with China Railways. The company already has a presence in China and Singapore.

 Retail outlets

 The company expects to generate a revenue of Rs 250 crore in the next two years from its retail format Caf Deliver.

 We have opened our fourth Caf Deliver in the city and plan to open another eight in the next three months and 20 by the end of the year. The outlets will showcase Gati products and end-to-end solutions, Choudhary said. 

 The outlets will also provide photocopying, printing and Internet services. 

 Around Rs 12 to Rs 15 lakh is required to set up a 1,000-sq-ft Caf Deliver. Gatis retail format contributes 25 per cent to the companys turnover.

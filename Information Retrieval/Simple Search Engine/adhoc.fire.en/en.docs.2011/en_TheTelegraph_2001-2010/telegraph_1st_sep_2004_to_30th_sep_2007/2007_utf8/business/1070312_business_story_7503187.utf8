 New Delhi, March 11 (PTI): Italys largest coffee company Lavazza Group, the new owner of coffee chain Barista and Fresh and Honest Caf, will invest 100 million euros (about Rs 600 crore) in the next three years to expand business in India.

 Lavazza will invest 100 million euros in the next three years to increase the presence of Barista and Fresh and Honest Caf, Barista coffee company CEO Partha Duttagupta said.

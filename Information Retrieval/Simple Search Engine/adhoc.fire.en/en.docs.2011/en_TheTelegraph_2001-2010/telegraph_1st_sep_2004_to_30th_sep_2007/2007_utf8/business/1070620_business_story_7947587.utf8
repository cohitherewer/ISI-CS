 Sterlite shines on NYSE debut

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 19: Vedanta Resources executive chairman Anil Agarwal today rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to mark the listing of his group company Sterlite Industries.

 The American depositary shares (ADS) of Sterlite, traded under the symbol SLT, opened at $14.10 per share on the NYSE against the issue price of $13.44 per ADS.

 Sterlite had raised $1.75 billion through the initial public offering of 13.04 crore shares in the form of ADS. 

 After the offer, these shares represent around 18.9 per cent interest in Sterlite.

 Sterlites IPO is the biggest offering from India till date.

 The ADS hit a high of $14.83 on the NYSE. Over 12.89 million ADS exchanged hands on the bourse.

 Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner amp; Smith Inc, Morgan Stanley amp; Co and Citigroup were the underwriters, joint global coordinators and book-runners for the offering. 

 Nomura Singapore is the underwriter for the public offering without listing in Japan. Sterlite expects to allocate 11.5 million equity shares in the form of ADS in that country.

 In its filing with the Securities and Exchanges Commission of the United States, Sterlite had said it would use the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital, reduction of debt, acquisitions of complementary businesses and consolidation of the ownership in its subsidiaries.

 Sterlite added that it planned to exercise the call option for acquiring the Government of Indias remaining 29.5 per cent ownership interest in Hindustan Zinc Ltd. This will be 26 per cent if the government exercises its right to sell 3.5 per cent of Hindustan Zinc to its employees.

 The company had also said funds raised from the issue would be used for its foray into power generation. 

 The company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Sterlite Energy, is planning to build the first phase, totalling 2,400mw, of a thermal coal-based power facility in Orissa.

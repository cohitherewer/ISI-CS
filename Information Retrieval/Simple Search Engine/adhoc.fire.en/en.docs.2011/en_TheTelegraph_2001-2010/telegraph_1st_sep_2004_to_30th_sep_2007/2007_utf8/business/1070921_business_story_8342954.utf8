 GE lays foundation for home loan rivalry

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: Consumer finance company GE Money today said it would offer floating rate home loans at 9.99 per cent.

 Funds at such low rates will be provided by Wizard Home Loans, a joint venture between GE Money and global mortgage player Wizard.

 Among major lenders, only Punjab National Banks interest rate of 9.75 per cent is lower. ICICI, Axis and HDFC Bank offer loans at a much higher rate of 11 per cent, while the State Bank of India charges 11.25 per cent.

 GE India chief executive officer T.P. Chopra said, The joint venture will invest $200 million in equity in India and aims to set up over 250 branches across the country by 2011.

 Wizard chairman Mark Bouris said loans would be offered through franchisees, who would be paid upfront fees and monthly commissions as long as loans remained on the company books. 

 Egisto Franceschi, the chief executive officer of Wizard India, said, The cost of funds would be relatively lower as the company would get funds from its GE relationship. 

 The domestic home loans segment is expanding at a compounded annual growth rate of 30 per cent since 2001. 

 Banks are keen on lowering rates from next month which is the start of the festive season.

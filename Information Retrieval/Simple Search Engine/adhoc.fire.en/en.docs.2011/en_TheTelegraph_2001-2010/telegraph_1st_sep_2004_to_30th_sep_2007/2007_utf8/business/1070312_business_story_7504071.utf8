 Insurance premium up 26% after detariff

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, March 11: General insurance companies have clocked a 25.6 per cent growth in premium income in January, dispelling fears of a shakeout after the dismantling of the tariff regime.

 From January 1, the regulator allowed general insurance companies to price the premium on their products, excepting motor insurance, on the basis of their own risk assessment. 

 Till December last year, the Tariff Advisory Committee fixed the premium for motor, engineering and fire insurance. Insurers had to charge a fixed sum irrespective of whether they were suffering losses or making gains.

 With the detariffing of all general insurance products except for motor insurance there were fears of a price war in the face of competition, which could lead to lower premium income for insurers. 

 In motor insurance, insurers are allowed to fix the own damaged part of the premium, while that for third-party liability was kept under the administrative control of the regulator. However, the premium growth in January was significantly higher compared with December. 

 General insurance companies clocked a 17.9 per cent growth in premium income in December, with a total accretion of Rs 328 crore. The increase in gross premium income in January was Rs 451.05 crore, a 25.6 per cent growth over December.

 However, the accretion to premium income was higher in November at Rs 469 crore, or 31.6 per cent. The growth in October and September last year was Rs 448 crore (25.3 per cent) and Rs 400 crore (25.8 per cent) respectively.

 The total premium income by the general insurance companies up to January during the current financial year (Rs 20,775.18 crore) was almost 24 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago.

 The growth in the general insurance business was mainly contributed by private players, who have been reporting over 65 per cent growth on an average every month. In January, they have achieved a growth rate of 71 per cent compared with 65 per cent in December. 

 Among private players, only HDFC Chubb reported a decline in its business in the current financial year. 

 The four public sector players United India Insurance Company, National Insurance Company, Oriental Insurance Company and New India Assurance Company who jointly control nearly 65 per cent of the general insurance market, also doubled their premium income growth in January to 8.8 per cent from 4 per cent in December. A faster growth by private players has raised their market share to 36.8 per cent in January.

 Volvo to acquire Nissan Diesel

Tokyo, Feb. 20 (Reuters): Swedish truck maker Volvo said on Tuesday it would take over Nissan Diesel Motor Co Ltd for $1.1 billion, seeking to grow further in Asia and capitalise on the Japanese truck makers expertise.

 Volvo, which currently owns 19 per cent of Nissan Diesel, said it would offer 540 yen in cash for all the shares it does not own.

 That is a 22 per cent premium to Mondays closing price and a 32 per cent premium to Nissan Diesels average price over the past three months.

 The Swedish firm, which makes Volvo, Renault and Mack trucks, said the value of the tender offer was 7.5 billion Swedish crowns ($1.1 billion) but added that it would also assume net interest-bearing debt at Nissan Diesel, estimated at another 7.5 billion crowns.

 Shares of the Japanese truck maker were untraded with a flood of buy orders early on Tuesday. Nissan Diesels products and know-how represent a valuable complement to the groups truck business, Volvo chief executive Leif Johansson said in a statement.

 Nissan Diesel has a solid position in Japan and the rest of Asia where the Volvo Group foresees substantial growth potential, he said.

 The Tokyo Stock Exchange placed the truck maker on administrative watch after Nissan Diesel said Volvo planned to make it a wholly owned unit and it would be delisted. Nissan Diesel also cut its annual dividend forecast to nil from a previous estimate of 3 yen. 

 Volvo said it expects that payment could be made for acquired shares around March 29. The two companies plan a news conference at 3.00 pm in Tokyo. Volvo said it would benefit from Nissan Diesels expertise in medium-heavy trucks and hybrid technology.

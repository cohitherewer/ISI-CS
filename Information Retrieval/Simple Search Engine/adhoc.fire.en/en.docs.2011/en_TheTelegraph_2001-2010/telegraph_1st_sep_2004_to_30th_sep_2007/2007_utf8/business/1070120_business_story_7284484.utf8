 Flakt lines up growth plans

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 19: Flakt India will diversify to ventilation and central air conditioning systems consultancy and supplies for buildings such as malls and parking plazas. The company has received a letter of intent for ventilation management of the Chennai Special Economic Zone, according to managing director Anil R. Baijal.

 The new business, along with the existing ones, would help Flakt India double its turnover from Rs 150 crore for the year ended December 31, 2006 to Rs 300 crore in the next three years, Baijal said. 

 Flakt India, a subsidiary of Swiss air engineering group Flakt Woods, is present in India for over 50 years and has two factories in Calcutta and Chennai. 

 Flakt India would do well by leveraging the Flakt brand in the new ventures, said Didier Forget, chief executive officer of the parent company.

 The company has invested Rs 2 crore on modernisation of both the plants to produce new products and upgrade the existing product mix. 

 The company is a leading supplier of air engineering devices to industries, including cement, steel, power, railways, petrochemicals, food processing, fertiliser, mining, agriculture, dairy, food and beverages. 

 Forget said the Flakt group, which hold a leading position in air handling business in Europe with production units in 30 countries worldwide and presence in 90 countries, got the Flakt brand valued at $400 million globally. No brand valuation, however, was done for the Indian market.

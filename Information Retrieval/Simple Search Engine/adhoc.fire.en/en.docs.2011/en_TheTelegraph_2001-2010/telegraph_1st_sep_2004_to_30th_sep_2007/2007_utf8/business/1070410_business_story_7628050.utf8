The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 AllBank business grows by 30%

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 9: Allahabad Bank has reported a nearly 30 per cent growth in business during 2006-07.

 According to the unaudited results for 2006-07 submitted to the stock exchanges today, the banks business for the entire financial year grew by 29.74 per cent to Rs 1,01,925 crore from Rs 78,561 crore in the previous year.

 Deposits grew by 22.77 per cent to Rs 59,545 crore (Rs 48,500 crore), while gross credit increased by 40.98 per cent to Rs 42,380 crore (Rs 30,061 crore).

 The banks credit-deposit ratio consequently shot up to 71.17 per cent on March 31, 2007 from 61.98 per cent a year ago. Incremental advances as a percentage of incremental deposits mobilised during 2006-07 was 111.53 per cent. The bank mobilised additional deposits of Rs 11,045 crore, while it made additional advances of Rs 12,319 crore.

 This was possible because we reduced our statutory liquidity ratio to 26.5 per cent from 29 per cent at the beginning of the year, said Allahabad Bank chairman and managing director A.C. Mahajan. 

 The bank has also reduced its gross non-performing assets to 2.6 per cent from 3.94 per cent on March 31, 2006.

 Though the bank has increased its priority and agriculture sector lending, the share of these two segments in its total credit portfolio has marginally decreased. 

 Allahabad Bank has recently raised its deposit rates by 50 basis points to 150 basis points. It has now decided to raise its prime lending rate (PLR) by 75 basis points to 13.25 per cent, but spare its existing borrowers who have taken housing loans worth Rs 10 lakh or less. For others, the interest rate will be increased, Mahajan said.

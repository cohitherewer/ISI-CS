 Q amp;A

 Equity schemes

 I invested Rs 25,000 in an equity scheme of a mutual fund. To get the maximum return from the investment, should I hold it for a longer term or sell it and reinvest in another fund?

 Robert Gomes, Calcutta

 Equity investments should always be looked upon as long-term holding. From this perspective, a mutual fund will give better return if one stays on with the investment for a longer period, say three years or more. However, a funds performance vis--vis other similar schemes will depend to a great extent on the skills and investment technique of fund managers. If your fund has a consistent track record of giving good returns (compared with its benchmark) over say, three to five years, you will do better staying invested. 

 Interest income

 I have a fixed deposit with a multinational private bank. My annual interest income from this account will be Rs 80,000 approximately. I am a housewife and dont have any other income. Will I have to pay any income tax or file income returns? 

 S. Sur, Calcutta

 Since your total annual income comprises interest income only and it is less than the basic exemption limit of Rs 145,000 for women in financial year 2007-08 , you wont have to file any income return. However, you will have to submit Form 15H with the bank for non-deduction of tax at source on the interest income. 

 Infrastructure bonds

 My wife is 67 years old and has sold her flat for Rs 8 lakh. She bought this flat in October 2001 for Rs 5 lakh. Will she have to pay a capital gains tax? Can she avoid paying the tax by investing in some bonds or mutual funds?

 A.K. Sengupta, Barasat

 Yes. The difference between the sale and purchase price of the flat will be treated as long-term capital gains. She will have to pay capital gains tax. The tax payment can be avoided if she reinvests the gain amount in Rural Electrification Corporation bonds, which are now on offer. Each bond has a face value of Rs 10,000 and one can invest up to Rs 5 lakh in one year. However, she cannot sell the bonds before three years. The bonds are available with financial product distribution companies and with REC offices. You can check the address on RECs website: www.recindia.nic.in.

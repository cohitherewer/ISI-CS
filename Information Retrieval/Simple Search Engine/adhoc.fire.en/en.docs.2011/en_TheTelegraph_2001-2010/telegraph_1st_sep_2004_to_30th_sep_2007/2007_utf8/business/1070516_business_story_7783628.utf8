 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lalbhai: Dress rehearsal

 Mumbai, May 15: If GAS is here, can Diesel be far behind?

 Another well-known luxury fashion brand is entering India. Diesel will soon be available at select destinations in the country through Arvind Mills. The Italian brand has entered into a joint venture agreement to establish Diesel India Fashion Arvind Private Ltd, which marks the official arrival of Diesel in the Indian market.

 Diesel has been planning to enter the Indian market for quite some time now, encouraged by the growing spending power within the economy. Reports had earlier said the brand was in talks with the Murjani group where the latter would act as a master franchisee. 

 However, after a careful and detailed search, Diesel chose to go with Arvind, one of the main players of the textile market,known for its launch and development of American brands in the local market. 

 Last September, group company Arvind Brands Ltd entered into a joint venture with VF Corporation of the US to market brands like Lee, Wrangler, Nautica, Jansport and Kipling.

 Diesel will start its operations by opening two stores one in New Delhi and the other in Mumbai before the end of this year. Diesel plans to open 15 stores within the next three years.

 Renzo Rosso, president and founder of Diesel, said, quot;I am very happy about this new addition to the Diesel Planet. India is a most incredible country, in terms of economic growth and for the very fast development of its fashion market.

 Sanjay Lalbhai, managing director of Arvind Mills, said, Diesel has truly created an alternate to luxury fashion. The prospect of bringing Diesel to the Indian inspirational consumers is indeed very exciting. It is also a matter of great prestige for Arvind to partner with Diesel -- a company internationally revered in the fashion business. quot;

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: The Centre was planning a long- term foreign currency denominated infrastructure bond for NRIs, finance minister P. Chidambaram said at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas here today.

 Since industry was planning over a period of 10-15 years, savings instruments needed to be of a longer duration, including those for non-resident Indians (NRIs) which were of just three years, Chidambaram added.

 New instruments are being designed for this purpose with adequate checks and balances for investor comfort, the minister said at the session on How to Get $1.5 Trillion of Capital Investment: The Resource Hurdle For Development. 

 Top North Block officials said the government was keen to issue long-term infrastructure bonds of 15-20 years. 

 The government had earlier, in 1998-99, issued such bonds for NRIs that were for five years with an interest rate of 7.75 per cent.

 Though issued by the SBI, the bonds were announced in the budget and perceived as government instruments. The NRIs also considered the interest rates as too costly.

 Officials said the Centre was keen to cut down on tax saving schemes, but was aware of the need for reliefs on long-term investment instruments to fund long gestation infrastructure projects such as highways and airports. 

 Bouyed by the success of new government securities that were lapped up at high interest rates, the government feels there will be a good market for long-term offerings among retail investors if sold at rates lower than that on government securities.

 The issue can be spiced up among middle-class retail investors and NRIs with tax reliefs.

 The SBI bonds too attracted tax benefit as interest on them was exempt from income tax. The bonds were also exempt from wealth and gift taxes. They were transferable and could be prematurely encashed in rupee. Loans were also available against them to third parties in India. 

 The minister indicated policies will be geared towards development of infrastructure, which needs investments of $320 billion with $20-25 billion in foreign funds. If NRIs decide to invest in Indias infrastructure, that will give an impetus to our economic growth and sustain it, he said.

 Chidambaram acknowledged the importance of NRIs as repositories of knowledge and proposed an institutional mechanism to tap this knowledge pool for development.

 Calcutta, Sept. 10: City-based companies are increasingly looking to set up offices in the UK, said Simon Wilson, the British deputy high commissioner to eastern India. 

 Tata Tea, Apeejay Group, IFGL Refractories, Simoco, Usha Martin, ABC Consultants, Ican-Nano and Cinemawallah already have a presence in the country. 

 Many more are contemplating a listing on the alternative investment market of the London Stock Exchange to raise capital, Wilson said at an interactive session with members of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry here today.

 At least two companies I know are considering a listing on the London Stock Exchange and six or seven more on the alternative investment market, said Kavin McCole, a senior official at the British High Commission. However, he did not give the names of the companies. 

 You wont be surprised that Calcutta-based companies were among the successful Indian investors last year, Wilson added.

 India is the third-largest investor in the UK after the US and Japan. In the last fiscal, Indian companies invested in 73 projects in the UK, including big-ticket investments such as the Tata Steel-Corus deal and the UB Groups acquisition of Whyte amp; Mackay.

 More than 60 per cent of the countrys investment in Europe went to the UK. There are about 600 Indian companies based in the UK.

 The flow of investments by British companies in India is also growing at a steady pace year-on-year, the latest being the Vodafone-Essar deal.

 Bengal ranks high on the countrys preferred list of investment destinations. The Lord Mayor of the City of London, Aldermann John Stuttard, who heads the UKs financial services sector, had visited the city with a 30-member delegation in May. 

 Since March, weve been organising trade missions for UK companies in the ports, healthcare, materials handling, legal services, education and urban regeneration sectors, Wilson said. 

 Next week, a delegation comprising UK companies from the water and sanitation department will visit India.

 Singh: Reaching out

 Mumbai, Feb. 19: Tata Tea Ltd will set up a new company for its plantation operations in 24 estates in Assam and Bengal. International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Infrastructure Leasing amp; Financial Services Ltd (IL amp;FS) will have an equity stake of 20 per cent each in the new company.

 Tata Tea will also hold 20 per cent in the new company, to be named Amalgamated Plantations Ltd. Globally Managed Services (GMS), which offers services to meet workforce needs, will also hold a minority stake in the company. Employees across North India and Dooars in Bengal will have a shareholding between 15 and 20 per cent. 

 Hardeep Singh, who was chairman of Cargill India, will also have a stake. Singh will be the chairman of the new company. 

 Tata Investment Corporation will also have a small shareholding in the new entity. Amalgamated Plantations will take over the business from April 1 and its enterprise value is put at over Rs 360 crore.

 Close to 24,000 hectares will come under Amalgamated Plantations. However, the company will not focus on tea alone. It will use 5 per cent of the land to grow other crops.

 R.K. Krishna Kumar, vice-chairman of Tata Tea, said the idea is to unlock the potential of land assets by taking up crop diversification. The potential in North India is huge. While Assam is fertile, so is North Bengal, which is suitable for growing other crops, he added. An added advantage is the large workforce, which can realise these plans.

 Krishna Kumar added that the company has requested the Bengal government to allow Amalgamated Plantations to venture into other crops.

 Vodafone gets $2bn tax tab

 New Delhi, Sept. 4: The income tax department has reportedly sent a notice to Vodafone, which acquired a controlling stake in Hutch Essar earlier this year, demanding payment of capital gains tax on the deal.

 Vodafone officials refused to confirm or deny reports that the long-awaited notice from the IT department had finally been served.

 A notice has been sent to the company, but it is yet to respond, said sources.

 In May, Vodafone had paid $10.9 billion in cash to Hutchison Telecom International Ltd (HTIL) for the 52 per cent controlling stake in Hutchison Essar.

 In its notice, the income tax department has said Vodafone should have deducted tax at source prior to making the payment to Hong Kong-based HTIL.

 According to income tax rules, Vodafone should have deducted capital gains tax of $2 billion from the total amount of $10.9 billion paid to HTIL, which should have been turned over to the income tax department. 

 However, tax experts contend that since the deal was struck overseas it would have been difficult for Vodafone to pay this money or to calculate the accurate amount of tax to be deducted since it would not have known HTILs acquisition cost of the Hutchison Essar shares.

 The capital gains tax comes to about $2 billion, which the income tax department has calculated at 22 per cent of $9 billion. 

 Capital gains tax is imposed at the rate of 20 per cent plus surcharge and education cess, making it 22 per cent.

 Analysts said the transaction would attract capital gains in India under Section 9(1)(i) of the I-T Act. 

 According to the section, if any property located in the country is transferred, it attracts capital gains tax. 

 The section does not provide for an exemption. 

 Earlier, the income-tax department had sent two letters to Vodafone Essar (earlier Hutchison Essar) asking it to impress upon HTIL to pay $1.9 billion as tax. 

 While a letter does not have any legal sanctity, a formal notice has to be complied with to avoid penal action, said officials.

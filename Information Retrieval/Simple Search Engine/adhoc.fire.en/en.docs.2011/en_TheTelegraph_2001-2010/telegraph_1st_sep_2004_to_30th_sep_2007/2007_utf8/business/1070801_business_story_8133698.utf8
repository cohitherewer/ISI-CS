 Reddy sucks out surplus cash 

CRR up, other rates unchanged

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 31: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today raised the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by half a percentage point to suck out surplus cash from the banking system but kept other key policy rates unchanged.

 CRR, which is the portion of deposits that banks maintain with the RBI, was raised to 7 per cent. This is expected to suck out Rs 16,000 crore from the system and put a brake on inflation. 

 RBI governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy, however, did not tinker with the reverse repo, repo and the bank rate in his quarterly review of the annual credit policy.

 The reverse repo rate stayed at 6 per cent, the repo at 7.75 per cent and the bank rate at 6 per cent.

 The reverse repo is the rate at which the RBI absorbs surplus cash from banks; the repo is the rate at which the RBI injects cash into the system; and the bank rate is the benchmark at which long-term loans are given by the central bank. When the RBI changes these benchmarks, it has an effect on bank lending and deposit rates.

 Reddys focus in the first quarter review was on liquidity management to check the inflation scrouge.

 He removed the ceiling of Rs 3,000 crore on the RBIs daily reverse repo auctions. 

 This cap was imposed when liquidity in the system was abundant because of high inflows and increased spending by the government. 

 Banks, left with surplus funds, used the reverse repo window solely as a cash management tool to earn high interest rates. 

 Its removal could drain out more cash from the system. 

 Speaking to reporters, Reddy said tackling inflation remained his top priority.

 Elaborating on the reasons which led to the hike in CRR despite inflation falling to less than 4.5 per cent, Reddy said the fear of high prices continued to linger in the minds of people. 

 Inflation is out of newspaper headlines but is it out of the minds of people? he asked. 

 Though the RBI will monitor prices, a more pressing need is the management of liquidity that has a bearing on inflation. Price stability is the best guarantor of sustainable growth, Reddy said. 

 The RBI governor said there was a need to monitor global oil and commodity prices because of their impact on inflation. 

 It is necessary to continuously assess the risks to the inflation outlook emanating from high and volatile international crude prices, the continuing firmness in key food prices and the uncertainties surrounding the evolution of demand-supply gaps globally as well as in India, the RBI said in its policy document. 

 Chamber mood

 The Confederation of Indian Industry today supported the RBIs decision to keep some key rates unchanged.

 It said the removal of the cap on reverse repo would help in effective management of the volatility in call markets. A hike in CRR may be an answer to high inflation, but it raises the question of availability of funds to small and medium enterprises, the CII said.

 Assocham president Venugopal Dhoot said the RBI was more concerned with inflation rather than growth.

 The RBI should have reduced the interest rates so that we could aim at achieving over 9 per cent GDP growth this year, he said.

 Dhoot said liquidity, which was not the concern of industry, might be a problem in the future because of the rise in cash reserve ratio. 

 The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) has also opposed the hike in cash reserve ratio.

 If a hike had become unavoidable, the banks should have been paid interest on the money parked with the RBI so that the pressure on them to increase interest rate was lower, Ficci president Habil Khorakiwala said.

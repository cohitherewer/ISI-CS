 Calcutta, Sept. 19: Britannia Industries is exploring the possibility of a legal action against French food company Groupe Danone over the unauthorised use of its Tiger biscuit brand in five countries Singapore, Pakistan, Malaysia, Egypt and Indonesia.

 At the annual general meeting of the company here today, Britannia chairman Nusli Wadia said the legal action had become necessary because Danone had never sought permission from Britannia to use the brand name in the five countries.

 Britannia managing director Vinita Bali said, This is a breach of trust and an act of copyright and trade mark violation. Danone has a fiduciary interest in Britannia and its subsidiaries didnt seek international licensing permission to use the Tiger brand, which has been created and developed by Britannia for India. 

 She said Danone had sought permission to use the brand in as many as 70 countries. The French company has got approval to use the brand in 45 of the 70 countries and it is selling biscuits under the brand in five of these countries.

 Given the large number of countries where Danone has registered the brand, it will be difficult for Britannia to file a case everywhere. Company officials are, however, not ruling out an out-of-court settlement. 

 According to Bali, Danone initiated the process of registering the brand way back in 1998-99. It usually takes two to three years to get the registration done. When we applied for registering our Tiger biscuit brand for export purposes, our application was rejected on the ground that the brand was already registered by Danone. 

 Wadia said the Britannia board would take a decision once a panel on intellectual property rights submitted its view. 

 Formed a year ago, the panel is made up of three independent directors of Britannia. It is seeking advice from lawyers in India and the UK.

 Tiger is Britannias No. 1 brand in India. Bali said Britannia has sought registrations for the brand in 14 countries. She said Britannia, on its part, took Danones permission to use the French companys Little Hearts brand in India.

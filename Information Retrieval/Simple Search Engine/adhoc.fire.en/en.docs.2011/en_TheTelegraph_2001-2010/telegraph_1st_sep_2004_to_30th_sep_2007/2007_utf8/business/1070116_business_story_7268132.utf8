 Citigroup, CDC tie the knot for African safari 

 Going great guns

 Johannesburg, Jan.15 (Reuters): CDC Group, a private equity investor owned by the British government, has teamed up with US banking giant Citigroup to invest at least $200 million in Africa. 

 CDC would invest $100 million in Citigroups first dedicated African private equity fund, CVCI Africa Fund, with the U.S. bank matching that amount, CDC and Citigroup said in a joint statement. 

 The fund will be managed by Citigroup Venture Capital International (CVCI), a unit of Citigroup Alternative Investments. CVCI is excited about this opportunity to pursue investments in Africa. We believe Africa is a high potential market where we can generate attractive returns, said CVCI head Dipak Rastogi. 

 CDC, whose latest investment brings its total commitments to Africa to over $830 million, said there were investment opportunities for the fund in infrastructure, natural resources, energy, telecom and general manufacturing. 

 We believe that profitable investments in such areas will create wealth and alleviate poverty in the growing economies, CDC chief executive officer Richard Laing said. 

 GDP on the rise

 CVCI said Africa boasted rising GDP growth rates and large markets in nine big countries with a combined GDP of $600 billion and a population of 400 million. 

 The amounts invested by the fund and other CVCI-managed funds in individual deals are expected to range between $20 million to $60 million and will be invested in firms in Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa. 

 CDC said its backing of the Citigroup fund will benefit the private equity industry in Africa. A surge in private equity activity in South Africa last year and substantial profits for the backers of pan-African mobile phone operator Celtel, which was sold to Kuwaits MTC in 2005 for $3.4 billion, have drawn the interest of foreign investors in the industry. 

 South Africas Edgars Consolidated Stores Ltd. is in talks for a $3-billion acquisition by private equity firms Bain Capital, Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts amp; Co, the Wall Street Journal said last month. 

 Retailer Shoprite also said last month that South Africas Securities Regulation Panel would decide on February 23 whether a $1.8-billion proposed private equity buyout South Africas biggest private equity deal yet can go ahead.

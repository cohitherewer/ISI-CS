 Get a taste of mutuals for a smaller SIP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 FUND FROLIC

 Mumbai, April 5: After it made waves with the offer of attractive brokerage rates for stock market transactions, the Reliance-Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (R-ADAG) is now holding a bait to the man on the street to persuade him to invest in mutual funds.

 Reliance Mutual Fund is coming out with a scheme under which an individual will have to put in just Rs 100 per month under its systematic investment plan (SIP).

 By doing this, Reliance will be the first asset management company in the country to offer investment in SIPs at such a low threshold.

 At present, the minimum amount that can be invested through an SIP is Rs 500 per month. Company officials said the move was aimed at helping more people access the benefits of mutual funds by lowering the entry barriers.

 Reliance MF is the countrys largest fund house and recently nudged ICICI Prudential to the second slot. Figures released by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) show that Reliance MF has an asset base of over $10 billion. 

 According to Amfi, the assets under management (AUM) of Reliance MF stood at Rs 46,306.77 crore in March. It is the first fund house in the country whose AUM has crossed Rs 45,000 crore.

 While the mutual fund has been attributing this feat to its focus on retail investors and its good reach in the country, its latest initiative could see the fund house further consolidating its position over the next few months. 

 Reliance MF has also seen a good response to its fixed maturity plans (FMP) and reports say that it mobilised more than Rs 600 crore from such FMPs in March alone.

 Observers who track the mutual fund industry point out that the popularity of the instrument among retail investors has only grown with SIPs playing a major role.

 SIPs give investors the option to invest regularly in small instalments. Moreover, with electronic transfer facilities available, investors do not have to take the trouble of issuing post-dated cheques. 

 Given the tight competition in the industry, the other fund houses are also expected to follow Reliance Mutual Funds lead in the case of SIPs. Although further details are not available, it is understood that investors putting in Rs 100 per month will have to commit that they will invest the amount for 60 months.

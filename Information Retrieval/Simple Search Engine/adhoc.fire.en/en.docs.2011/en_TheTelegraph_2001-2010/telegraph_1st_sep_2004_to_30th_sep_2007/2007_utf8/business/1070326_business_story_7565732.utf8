 Bulls stage a comeback

 On a high, again

 The bulls have started to kick up some dust once again. While all the global markets have rebounded, the star has been the Shanghai index, which has not only recovered all the ground it lost on February 27, but has gone ahead and touched new all-time highs.

 Back home, the story the bulls are peddling is that the valuations of Indian stocks have come back to reasonable levels. UBS, for instance, has upgraded India from underweight to neutral, citing the following reasons: one, thanks to its poor performance this year, Indias premium is down from 31 per cent at end October 2006 to just 5 per cent. Thats the lowest premium it has had since September 2004. Second, India is no longer one of the most expensive markets in the region the most overvalued markets are the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. And finally, earnings growth continues to have a lot of positive surprises, with consensus EPS upgrades continuing in February and March. The best part is that these upgrades are coming in spite of a high base, underlining the strength of the India growth story.

 What about the risks? The UBS research note points at four of them: the global sell-off may last longer; the RBIs tightening of monetary policy may have further to go; the potential supply of new paper; and EPS growth and RoE may slow down in 2008. 

 At first glance, further tightening by the RBI looks like a done deal with the recent data on both industrial production and the infrastructure index coming in very strong. The interesting thing about the inflation data is that inflation in manufactured products is now 6.5 per cent, around the same as the headline inflation. Thats an indication that manufacturers are getting back pricing power, which in turn shows the strength of demand. And while the RBI may not be able to do much about the inflation in primary commodities, it can certainly influence demand. Thats why everybody expects the RBI to raise interest rates again.

 The markets cannot fight the RBI, but the bulls are now discovering reasons to look beyond the tightening cycle. BRICS India Equity Research, for example, has put out a strategy note that recommends buying interest rate sensitive sectors. Their argument is that the components of inflation that have resulted in higher overall headline figure are all likely to see significant base effect-related drop by May 2007. The note points out that manufacturing inflation has been driven up by commodities, including cement, metals and agricultural inputs. A combination of the high base effect and lower commodity prices going forward is expected to result in headline inflation, coming down to between 4 per cent and 4.9 per cent within the next 2-4 months.

 Citigroup, too, expects the headline inflation number to start coming down as the monetary and fiscal measures aimed at bringing down prices start taking effect. They expect inflation to remain between 5.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent until April and maintain that the RBI could raise its policy rate by another 25 basis points in April. After that, however, inflation is expected to go down towards 5 per cent by May. That would mean the end of the monetary tightening cycle.

 Its on that basis that the BRICS Securities note advises to stock up on interest rate-sensitive stocks, such as banks and autos. In short, the bulls are looking beyond the interest rate hikes to the day when liquidity will be back. Its the same sentiment that propelled the recent rally after the US Fed indicated that it may be through with further rate hikes.

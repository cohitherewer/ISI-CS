 Nasdaq yet to decide on LSE stake

 London, Jan. 6 (Reuters): Nasdaq Stock Market Inc said it had made no decision about what it would do with its 28.75 per cent stake in London Stock Exchange Group Plc if its hostile bid for the UK company falls through.

 No decisions have been made about its (Nasdaqs) strategy for its LSE shares in the event of a lapsed bid, Nasdaq said in a statement on Friday.

 Nasdaqs options include selling all or a portion of its stake and/or competing directly in the London market (either on its own or in co-operation with another party), it added.

 January 27 is the last date that either side can announce any new information on the bid situation, while February 10 is the final date for acceptances by shareholders.

 Last month, the LSE urged shareholders to reject the 2.7-billion hostile bid from the largest US electronic stock market, saying it substantially undervalued the company in relation to its peers.

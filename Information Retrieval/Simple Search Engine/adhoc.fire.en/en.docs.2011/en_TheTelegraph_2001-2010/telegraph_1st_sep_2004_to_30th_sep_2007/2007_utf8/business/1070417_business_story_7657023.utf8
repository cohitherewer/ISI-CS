 Mumbai, April 16: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,195.19 crore for the quarter ended March 31, a 43.6 per cent rise over the net profit Rs 832.12 crore in the corresponding period last year.

 This was in line with the Street expectations of a net profit of around Rs 1,180 crore. 

 TCS also declared a final dividend of Rs 4 per share of Re 1.

 The companys profit grew despite the rupees appreciation against the dollar, thereby indicating that both volume growth and higher price realisations contributed to the growth. An appreciating rupee is believed to have hit margins by more than 55 basis points.

 TCS said total income (on a consolidated basis) for the fourth quarter rose to Rs 5,266.91 crore, up from Rs 3,754 crore in the same period last year. Net profit for the entire year rose to Rs 4,212.63 crore, up from Rs 2,966.74 crore. Total income was Rs 18,914.26 crore against Rs 13,377.88 crore in 2005-06.

 TCS chief executive S. Ramadorai said: The companys robust business model has given us the position to capitalise from the strong demand environment that exists globally.

 S. Mahalingam, chief financial officer of TCS, said despite currency volatility seen during the year, the company was successful in achieving over $4 billion in revenues for 2006-07 and over a billion dollars in operating income. 

 During the year, TCS closed 12 deals worth over $50 million.

 SEZ investment on Soros agenda

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 George Soros: Interested

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: Global financial major Soros group is keen to invest in special economic zones (SEZs) in India, even as the entire issue has come under a shadow in the country. 

 Soros foundation deputy chairman Robert Soros, son of billionaire investor George Soros, met top officials in the commerce ministry last week and conveyed his interest in investing in the SEZs.

 Soros delved into the fine print of the governments SEZ policy and sought clarifications from officials on the fiscal incentives provided in the act.

 A commerce ministry official said the Soros family is keen on investing in multi-product SEZs that would require at least 1,000 hectares of land. Soros also enquired about the proposed technology zones. However, the group does not have any particular location in mind at the moment. 

 Besides Soros, investors from Japan and Singapore, who were sitting on the sidelines so for, have started showing interest in investing in SEZs, the official said.

 Commerce ministry officials are worried that the controversies over SEZs could discourage global investors.

 Already FDI to the tune of $14 billion is expected to flow into the 63 SEZs that have been notified by the government.

 Meanwhile, as part of a new initiative to allay fears over FDI inflows, commerce minister Kamal Nath has decided to set up an expert committee to look into the sectors that are attracting most of the FDI inflow and the impact on rural economy. 

 The minister told members of the parliamentary consultative committee yesterday evening that the purpose of this exercise would be to ensure equitable distribution of FDI and to bridge the rural-urban divide. 

 He told them that inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) into India have witnessed a quantum leap during the current financial year and are expected to be more than double the inflows recorded last year. The minister said FDI inflows by the end of this fiscal would reach $12 billion, implying an unprecedented 120 per cent growth over the previous year.

 FDI equity inflows during the current year (April-November 2006) had been $7.2 billion the highest-ever received in equity capital since the commencement of economic liberalisation in India, he said. 

 Monthly inflows this fiscal crossed $1 billion on three occasions in the months of July, October and November 2006, he added.

 Tight money policy to slow credit offtake

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: The Economic Survey has forecast a slowdown in credit growth on the back of tighter money policy. However, since credit as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) is low, it will continue to outpace GDP in terms of growth, it said.

 The rapid rise in credit growth in the recent years has reflected and also helped the growth momentum ... But it is unlikely that this will grow as fast as it did in the recent past, the survey said.

 The credit-deposit ratio has continued to grow during this year so far. It was 74 per cent on January 19, 2007, compared with 70 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year.

 The Reserve Bank had raised its cash reserve ratio to 6 per cent from 5.5 per cent earlier this month to take money out of the banking system in a bid to slow rapid credit growth that is helping fuel inflation.

 The move was sparked by the rising inflation rate, which reached 6.73 per cent this month its highest level in more than two years and well above the 5 to 5.5 per cent the apex bank has forecast for the year ended March.

 This tighter money policy was leading to a hardening of the interest rate despite a comfortable liquidity position, it added. 

 However, the survey observed that the hardening of interest rates was more pronounced in the short-end. It suggested that taming the inflation and maintaining the pace of growth should be balanced, and asked to integrate the rural sector, especially agriculture, with the organised financial sector to arrest rising prices. 

 The survey, considered to be a report card on the governments performance and also its policy statement, said the credit policy would have to carefully maintain the international competitiveness of the domestic economic activities, underscoring the importance of keeping interest rates in check.

 On the financial performance of the banking sector, the survey said the upbeat growth trend of 9.1 per cent in the first half of 2006-07 had led to a 32 per cent jump in gross bank credit to Rs 15,76,982 crore. The gross bank credit at the end of September 2005 stood at Rs 11,94,588 crore.

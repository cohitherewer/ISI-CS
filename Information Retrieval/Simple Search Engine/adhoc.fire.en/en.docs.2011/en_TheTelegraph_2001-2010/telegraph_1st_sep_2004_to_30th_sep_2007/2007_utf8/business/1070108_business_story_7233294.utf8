 Good results on the cards

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Mumbai, Jan. 7: After setting a scorching pace in the first half, India Inc is widely tipped to report solid numbers in the third quarter as well. 

 The announcement of the third quarter results will kick off this week with iGATE, HDFC Bank, Infosys Technologies and UTI Bank to be the first off the blocks.

 All eyes are on Infosys. The bellwether for the IT sector had beat estimates in the second quarter with a 51 per cent rise in net profit to Rs 896 crore. Infy had also raised the revenue guidance for the fiscal to $3 billion. 

 For the third quarter ended December 31, 2006, Infosys said income would be in the range of Rs 3,602 crore to Rs 3,625 crore, a year-on-year growth of 42.3-43.2 per cent. 

 Though the second-half is considered a weak period, analysts expect Infosys to beat these estimates, made on October 11 last year. 

 However, observers are keeping a close watch on two factors wage hikes and a rising rupee which appreciated by a little over 3 per cent in the second quarter. 

 Brokerages, however, expect Infosys to dish out revenues of at least Rs 3,650 crore for the third quarter, with some even taking a call of more than Rs 3,700 crore. The net profit before exceptional items is expected to be at least Rs 950 crore. 

 Brokerages such as Morgan Stanley estimate a year-on-year growth in net profit of between 35-50 per cent and in revenues of between 30-40 per cent for the IT sector.

 If IT services are expected to fare well, so too are other industries. Auto components, banks, cement and even the oil sector are expected to maintain the blistering pace set in the first half. Advance taxes were also encouraging, indicating the robust health of companies. SBI, ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries and Tata Steel reported higher tax outflows.

 For the banking sector as a whole, we may see profits growing by 20-30 per cent on good loan growth ... certain sectors, such as cement, have benefited from a robust demand and they have been able to successfully pass on price hikes, analysts added.

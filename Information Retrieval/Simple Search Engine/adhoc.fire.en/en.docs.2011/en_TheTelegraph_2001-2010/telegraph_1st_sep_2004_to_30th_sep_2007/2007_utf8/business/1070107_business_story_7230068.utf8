 Mumbai, Jan. 6: In a move to shore up resources for meeting the strong demand for credit, the State Bank of India (SBI) has again raised interest rates on domestic term deposits, the second time in less than a month.

 SBI said interest rates on domestic term deposits of Rs 15 lakh and above but less than Rs 1 crore will now be 8.25 per cent across all maturities of one year and above. 

 On December 8, the countrys largest commercial bank had increased interest rates on domestic term deposits by 25-75 basis points. But these were for deposits of up to Rs 15 lakh. Consequently, interest rate on deposits between 7 and 14 days was hiked to 3.75 per cent (from 3.50 per cent) and that between 15 and 45 days to 5 per cent (4.75 per cent).

 Similarly, interest rate on these deposits having duration of 46-179 days was increased to 5.50 per cent and that between 180 days and less than 1 year fetched 6.50 per cent.

 In the case of these deposits, the interest rate for maturity of 1 year to less than 3 years was increased to 7.50 per cent (6.75 per cent), that between 3 years to less than 5 years was hiked to 7.75 per cent (7 per cent earlier).

 The rate of interest for domestic term deposits for maturities of 1 year and above of Rs 15 lakh but less than Rs 1 crore was 25 basis points over these rates.

 However, in a surprise announcement today, SBI said it has decided to revise the interest rate on domestic term deposits of Rs 15 lakh and above but less than Rs 1 crore to 8.25 per cent for all maturities of 1 year and above with effect from January 8 for a limited period and that the offer will end on March 31. 

 Dena PLR

 State-run Dena Bank has increased its benchmark prime lending rate (PLR) by 50 basis points to 12.25 per cent with effect from January 8.

 Interest rates on domestic term deposits too have been hiked with effect from January 11. For different maturities with a period ranging from one to five years, interest rates have been hiked by half a percentage point for deposits up to Rs 15 lakh.

 Priority loan rules tweaked

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New norms

 Mumbai, Jan. 17: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has tightened the priority sector norms for commercial banks. 

 It has ruled that if banks fail to meet priority sector lending targets and park the funds with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) or Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) then such deposits would not be classified as indirect finance to agriculture or small-scale industries. 

 Releasing the draft guidelines on lending to priority sectors, the central bank said the targets and sub-targets under this head would now be linked to adjusted net bank credit (ANBC). 

 The ANBC comprises net bank credit and investments made by banks in non-SLR bonds in the held-to-maturity category. Bankers say this benchmark will lead to higher credit to the priority sector. 

 Priority sectors are those where banks compulsorily lend a part of their total credit. The central bank has stipulated that banks (nationalised banks) must direct 40 per cent of their loans to this sector, which includes agriculture, housing loans (less than Rs 15 lakh), education loans, small-scale enterprises and micro credit. There are sub-targets for each of these categories. 

 Banks could earlier place funds with both Nabard and Sidbi to compensate for any shortfall in priority sector lending. Now this will change.

 For public sector banks, the total priority sector advances stands at 40 per cent of ANBC, while in the case of foreign banks, it is placed at 32 per cent of ANBC. 

 Foreign banks have no targets as far as agricultural advances are concerned due to a weak branch network, while nationalised banks must lend at least 18 per cent of their ANBC to agricultural advances. 

 However, there is good news for educational loans. The draft norms said such loans granted to individuals for educational purposes up to Rs 10 lakh for studies in India and Rs 20 lakh for studies abroad could be included under the priority sector. As the earlier limits were over Rs 7 lakh and Rs 15 lakh, respectively, the proposed norms could see increased advances to this category. 

 The RBI said the issue of charging penal interest for default in repayment and non-submission of financial statements will rest with the board of each bank. Banks will formulate policy for charging such penal interest.

 Calcutta, Sept. 6: Wipro BPO plans to ramp up its headcount to 25,000 from 20,000 in the next couple of years.

 The company expects 20 per cent of its revenues to come from abroad in the next five years.

 V. Anandkumar, vice-president (people supply chain and employee branding) of Wipro BPO, said, We have 3,000 people in our Calcutta centre and expect to hire another 500 in the next six months. We have grown by 100 per cent in this city in the last year.

 BPO work in finance and accounting will be taken up in the city, for which the company will make additional recruitment. 

 These services are now provided by the Chennai centre. Anandkumar said the city centre lost 5 mandays last year whereas other centres lost 1-2 days.

 The company is open to expanding in other parts of the state, such as Siliguri, provided there is adequate infrastructure and availability of manpower.

 In international operations, Wipro recently opened a centre in Shanghai and plans to open one more in China.

 The company has also studied the feasibility of a centre in the Philippines where many companies have set up shop.

 We liked what we saw and could consider it as our next location in this part of the globe, Anandkumar said.

 In Europe, the company has recently set up a centre in Bucharest, which employs nearly 100 people.

 Wipro is also exploring locations in the US and South America. In India, besides the expansion of the Hyderabad facility, centres are coming up in Bhubaneswar, Visakhapatnam, Kochi and Noida. 

 The company is also trying to get more clients from within the country and the target areas are telecom and banking. India contributes about 2 per cent to its revenues. Acquisitions are also part of the companys growth plans, Anandkumar said.

 Q amp;A

 Earning abroad

 My son has earned a salary of Rs 80,000 in India from April to November last year. From December, he is in Iran on a contract service with a multinational company. His current salary is credited to the non-resident extension savings account in a bank in India. Will he have to submit income tax return for the assessment year 2007-08 on his income in India?

 B.N. Poddar, Calcutta

 Since your sons total annual income in India is less than Rs 1 lakh, he wont have to submit income tax return. However, it should be remembered that filing income tax return for those having income less than Rs 1 lakh is voluntary. He can file the return for his income in India for the period mentioned just to remain clean from his side. I believe, the salary he is receiving abroad and getting credited to the bank account here is tax deducted. 

 Ulip maturity

 I had invested Rs 6,000 in a unit-linked insurance plan of UTI for a period of 10 years. On maturity I received Rs 1,19,000 in January 2007. What will be my tax liability on the maturity amount? Do I have to pay any capital gains tax?

 Sanjana Ghosh, Calcutta

 The unit-linked insurance plan of UTI enjoys the tax benefits under section 80 C as well as insurance coverage. The withdrawals on maturity from this plan are not taxed in the hands of the recipients. 

 Share transfer

 If I transfer some shares from one demat account to another, both in my name, will there be any charges. Do I have to close the demat account from where I want to transfer the shares?

 Nikhil Bardhan, Calcutta

 Yes, you can transfer shares held in one of your demat accounts to another. But the depository participant from whom you are transferring the shares will charge a fee to debit the account. You need not close the demat account unless you are dissatisfied with the depository participant from where you want to transfer the shares.

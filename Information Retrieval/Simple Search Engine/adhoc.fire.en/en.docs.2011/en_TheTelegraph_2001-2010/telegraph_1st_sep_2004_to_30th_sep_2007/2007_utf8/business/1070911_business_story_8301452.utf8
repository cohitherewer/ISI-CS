 Bengal seeks govt aid for textile hubs

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bhattacharjee: Big plans

 Calcutta, Sept. 10: The Bengal government has sought the Centres help to set up textile hubs in the state.

 The state would require investments worth Rs 44.15 crore for textile parks and the associated infrastructure at a stretch covering Garden Reach, Metiabruz, Santoshpur and Akra in South 24 Parganas. 

 We hope we can get some funding from the Centre, said Bhattacharjee today at the foundation stone laying ceremony of an integrated readymade garment industries complex at Santoshpur. 

 The facility will be spread over 127 acres. Of this, around 93 acres have been acquired. The project will be completed in two years. 

 The development of the park will also involve the task of improving roads, and working conditions. Funds also need to be raised for an effluent treatment plant for bleached chemicals. 

 A raw material bank comprising bleaching and other components will also be set up.

 We have not had any significant investments in textiles in the state. But we have skilled manpower in areas such as South 24 Parganas . We plan to leverage our manpower and build another eight to 10 textile parks which will incorporate the local expertise in areas such as printing on silk, said Manab Mukherjee, state minister for cottage and small-scale industry.

 Mukherjee said that given the right impetus, textiles and allied sectors could generate the highest number of jobs after agriculture.

 The West Bengal Small Industries Development Corporation is also looking at joint ventures with textile and garment worker organisations to set up more such complexes.

 Export foundations will also be set up by the Apparel Export Promotion Council.

 Bhattacharjee assured that while the state would continue to focus on investments in sectors such as iron and steel, there would be an equal emphasis on the growth of the textile industry..

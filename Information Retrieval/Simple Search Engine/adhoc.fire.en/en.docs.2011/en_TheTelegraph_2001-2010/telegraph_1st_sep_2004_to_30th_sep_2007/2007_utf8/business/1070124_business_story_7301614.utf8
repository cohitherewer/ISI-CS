 New Delhi, Jan. 23: Dabur Pharma Ltd has posted an 18.05 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 8.93 crore during the third quarter ended December 31 compared with Rs 7.56 crore in the year-ago period. 

 The companys sales grew by 17.7 per cent at Rs 83.61 crore in the quarter against Rs 71.03 crore in the corresponding period of previous fiscal. Operating profits surged by 32 per cent to Rs 14.0 crore from Rs 10.58 crore in the same quarter last fiscal.

 For the nine months ended December 2006, net turnover rose 20.71 per cent to Rs 262.4 crore compared with Rs 217.4 crore in the year-ago period.

 Dabur Pharma chairman Anand Burman said, The companys initiatives to strengthen its business in India and key international markets like Mexico, Hungary, Thailand and the Philippines have reaped favourable results. The launch of Nanoxel Novel Drug Delivery Device for anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel and the strategic acquisition of the sales and distribution business from Thai-based Biosciences are steps towards strengthening the companys core areas and expanding the geographic reach.

 Burman said the company plans to strengthen its business in the domestic and international market and eyes considerable revenue from overseas sales.

 We anticipate a large portion of our overseas revenues from the US where we would launch our second product, solvent-based anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel, early next month, Burman added. The company would launch three oncology drugs in the US and European markets this year. 

 Dabur Pharma COO Ajay K. Vij said, Dabur Pharma has recorded an all-round growth in business with both the oncology and non-oncology formulation segments registering robust growth.

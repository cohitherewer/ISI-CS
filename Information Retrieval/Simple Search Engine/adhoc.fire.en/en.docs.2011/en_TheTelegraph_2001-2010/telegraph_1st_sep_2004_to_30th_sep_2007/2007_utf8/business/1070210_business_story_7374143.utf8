 Nath keen on more FDI in retail

 Nath: Keeping options open

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: Commerce minister Kamal Nath today said his ministry was still keen on opening up new segments of the retail sector to foreign direct investment (FDI). 

 The issue was under cloud after UPA president Sonia Gandhi wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to assess issues relevant to global retail giant Wal-Marts entry into India before taking any more decisions on opening up the retail sector.

 The commerce ministry is reported to have briefed the Prime Minister on the issue following Sonias letter.

 The ministry had given its final clearance to retail major Wal-Mart to form a joint venture with Bharti.

 The government decided to re-examine the proposal after the Left opposed the Wal-Mart deal as it violated the countrys FDI norms and would displace local retail stores.

 While India has not allowed FDI in multi-brand retail, foreign investment is permitted in wholesale trade, logistics and back-end activities.

 The Left parties had alleged that the tieup with Bharti would allow Wal-Mart to enter India through the back door.

 The ministry is believed to be sticking to its stand on further liberalisation in the retail sector. It is pushing ahead with the proposals to allow 51 per cent FDI in consumer electronics and sports goods.

 The department of industrial policy and promotion has prepared a cabinet note proposing FDI in retail for consumer electricals and electronics as well as sports goods and accessories, according to senior officials. This will be through approvals given by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board.

 However, it remains to be seen whether the government will go ahead with the move as this has to be approved by the cabinet. The department of industrial policy and promotion feels that by allowing FDI in electricals, electronics and sports goods, sourcing of these items from local manufacturers would pick up considerably.

 Bajaj factions trade charges

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 12: The war of words in the four-year-old battle that cleaved the Bajaj group has started to escalate once again.

 Almost four years after the warring sides signalled a truce with a family settlement in June 2003, the differences have boiled over once again.

 Under the terms of the settlement, Shishir Bajaj was to get control of Bajaj Hindusthan and Bajaj Consumer Care, while the other group firms were to go to Rahul Bajaj.

 The group led by Shishir Bajaj, younger brother of Rahul, has now accused the patriarch of not only trying to force his way into two family holding companies, but has also set his sights on taking control of Bajaj Hindustan Ltd (BHL) a charge that is rebutted by Rahul Bajaj.

 At the centre of the whole debate are three group holding companies Bajaj Sevashram, Jamnalal Sons and Bachraj amp; Co through which investments in the Bajaj group of companies are routed.

 The Shishir Bajaj faction now fears Rahul Bajaj had some other motives in appointing more nominees on the boards of Bajaj Sevashram and Jamnalal Sons. Sources now allege that Rahul Bajaj wants to take control of Bajaj Sevashram and Jamnalal Sons by inducting his son and cousin Sanjiv and Niraj on the respective boards.

 Further, Bajaj Autos acquisition of 1.9 per cent stake in BHL has also raised hackles of the Shishir Bajaj group with the latter suspecting that it is a move on the part of Rahul to oust the younger brother from BHLs board.

 According to Kushagra Bajaj, who is the nephew of Rahul and CEO of BHL, If a dictator (Rahul Bajaj) faces a domestic mutiny, his first reaction is to attack the neighbouring state or escalate an ongoing war to divert attention from his domestic problems.

 Rahul Bajaj vehemently rejects the charge and says he has no plans to push Shishir or his nominees from the holding companies.

 Speaking to newspersons on the sidelines of a function organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Rahul Bajaj claimed, We have the ownership and control of the two companies Bajaj Hindusthan and Bajaj Consumer Care. If we wanted, we could have thrown them (Shishir group) out, which we have not done and have no intention of doing.

 Bajaj also denied allegations of the other camp that efforts were being made to change the structure of the board of two family holding companies. He said the board meetings of these companies had already been postponed at the request made by the other group.

 However, these statements do not cut much ice with the Shishir Bajaj group. Sources said while the elder brother (Rahul Bajaj) has issued notices to change the board structure of the holding companies, BAL has also acquired shares of BHL and it has increased its stake in the company to 11.9 per cent from 10 per cent.

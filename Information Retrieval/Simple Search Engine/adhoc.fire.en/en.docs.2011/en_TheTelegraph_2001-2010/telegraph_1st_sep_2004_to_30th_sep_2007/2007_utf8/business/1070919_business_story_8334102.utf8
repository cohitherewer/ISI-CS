 Shopping time 

 London, Sept. 18 (Agencies): Standard Chartered will buy American Express Bank for $860 million to boost its private and correspondent banking services.

 Standard Chartered said American Express Bank, which focused on financial institutions and high net worth customers, would boost the groups transaction banking business and provide a change for its recently launched private bank, accelerating its private banking strategic growth plan by about three years.

 The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2008.

 Shares of Standard Chartered lost some gains on the initial announcement of the deal, but were up 2.6 per cent at midday, lifted along with the rest of the sector, at 1,507 pence.

 New Delhi, April 23: Indian companies should set up more offshore centres in Canada, central Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific, a Nasscom study has said.

 The study, prepared jointly with management firm KPMG, considers these regions as emerging IT destinations. 

 Though lagging behind India in IT capabilities, the regions provide quality workforce at low wages, which will give Indian companies an edge over their rivals in the US and western Europe.

 Five countries in central and eastern Europe Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia four in Latin America Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Argentina and four in Asia Pacific China, Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines have been identified by Nasscom as possible offshore destinations.

 Pradeep Udhas, partner-in-charge, global sourcing, KPMG, said, Indian companies are yet to reach the same scale of globalisation as their foreign counterparts, which have strong presence in emerging locations.

 The governments of emerging markets were pursuing IT-friendly policies, offering a scope for expansion to Indian companies, the report said.

 Making a region-wise analysis, Nasscom said the countries of central and eastern Europe have a literacy rate as high as 99 per cent and a large number of graduates.

 The Latin American countries, where the people speak Spanish and Portuguese, can cater to the non-English speaking market, particularly in western Europe.

 Asia Pacific provides many opportunities and risks. Apart from China, other countries in this region have a large population in the 22-26 age group. The region, thus, holds a great promise for Indian companies.

 In Canada, the level of skills is high, while the wage rates are low, which should encourage Indian companies to set up shop here.

 Nasscom said Indian companies were competent in project management, customer relationship management, transitioning and security and risk management.

 Govt bets on further fall in crude price

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Srinivasan: Rate concern

 New Delhi, Jan. 15: Petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan said the government expected crude oil prices to fall as speculators had started offloading their stocks.

 He said the bulk of the increase in crude prices was because of speculators holding on to stocks. He said speculators were only holding to paper stocks and not actually consuming the product.

 He feels speculative behaviour leads to an increased offloading of stocks as prices start coming down and an accumulation occurs when prices start rising.

 He was speaking at the Petrotech 2007 conference, where over 140 countries were participating and more than 500 foreign delegates were expected.

 Several ministers from oil producing countries would also attend the conference and bilateral discussions would be held both at the country-to-country and company-to-company levels.

 The conference would help exchange of ideas as the latest techniques for oil exploration would be discussed, and enable some business deals as well, he added.

 The price of the Indian basket for crude oil has come down to a new low of $51 per barrel during January but the government is still waiting for it to stabilise at a level below $50 per barrel.

 The average for the first week of January works out to $55.14 per barrel, according to the latest official figures. This represents a significant decline from the average of $60.35 per barrel for December. 

 The oil companies are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping the decline continues.

 Petroleum minister Murli Deora said the government was keeping a close watch on international prices of crude and it was too early say whether prices would stabilise at lower levels.

 International prices have started declining as the US, the biggest consumer of petroleum products, is going through a rather mild winter because of which the seasonal demand for petroleum products is lower than anticipated.

 However, with Opec members wanting to curtail their output of crude to check the fall in prices, it remains to be seen whether international crude prices actually settle down at the lower levels of previous years.

 India imports over 70 per cent of its crude oil requirements. 

 There is little that the oil companies can do to cut costs once international prices start rising since crude accounts for 90 per cent of the cost of production of petroleum products.

 Stage set for Asean FTA

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: India and the Asean appear to have resolved the deadlock in their proposed free trade agreement (FTA). The 10-member trade bloc has agreed to Indias proposal of having a negative list of 490 items with trade coverage not exceeding 5 per cent by both sides.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath was steadfast in keeping the list at 490 at his meeting today with the trade ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Cebu, Philippines, forcing the bloc, which had been insisting on a further reduction in the list, to concede to his proposal.

 A commerce ministry release said a consensus emerged at the meeting among the ministers on quickly signing the FTA not merely on grounds of trade but also for strategic reasons.

 It was agreed that negotiators would meet and resolve the remaining outstanding issues preferably by July 2007, the ministry said. 

 The consensus is significant in the context of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs impending visit to Cebu to attend the Asean summit.

 Trade ministers of Malaysia, the Philippines, Cambodia, Brunei, Lao, Indonesia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam attended the meeting with Nath.

 Nath argued at the meeting that tariff concessions by India provided adequate market access to Asean in India.

 He said Asean should provide reciprocal market access to Indias exports. The minister said India was concerned over Aseans negative list and urged the bloc to reduce the list.

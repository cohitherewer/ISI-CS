 Tata Steel takes a hit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 18: When Tata Steel swung the Corus deal in late January, there was a twinge of uneasiness among analysts over the huge price that the Rs 18,000-crore steel giant would be forking out for the UK steelmaker.

 With the steelmaker unravelling on Tuesday how it intends to pay for the acquisition, theres a growing sense of disquiet in the market over the equity dilution by the Tatas in the countrys lowest-cost steel producer. 

 Tata Steel plans to issue fresh equity through rights equity, rights convertible preference shares, and an overseas flotation to raise over Rs 10,000 crore to partly fund the buyout, sparking worries that the resulting equity dilution could hit its earnings per share (EPS).

 The Tata Steel stock was battered as the apprehensions kicked in today. The stock hit an intra-day low on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) at Rs 496.35, a drop of 6.10 per cent over the previous close. It clawed back at the close to Rs 511.35, a fall of 3.27 per cent.

 Tata Steel chose the equity option because it didnt want to weigh down its balancesheet with debt. But the market seems to have been unnerved by the move. 

 There will be an equity dilution of 30 to 40 per cent as a result of these issues which is quite high. This has the potential of hurting the companys EPS, an analyst said.

 Several leading brokerages have ratcheted down their ratings on the Tata Steel stock. SSKI, for instance, now has a neutral rating on Tata Steel from outperformer earlier. 

 Enam Securities estimated that the 1:5 rights equity issue and an overseas floatation were likely to reduce earnings per share for 2007-08 by 13 per cent. It further added that the issue of preference shares that could be converted into equity after two years would further reduce this fiscals EPS by 10 per cent.

 After the board meeting yesterday, senior Tata Steel officials, including managing director B. Muthuraman and vice-president (finance) Kaushik Chatterjee, had said the benefits flowing from the acquisition would, on a consolidated basis, be EPS accretive.

 It may be recalled that when Tata Steel emerged successful in its bid for Corus, its stock price faced selling pressure due to worries that the acquisition cost of 608 pence per share was expensive and that it could strain its balancesheet.

 Meanwhile, Tata Sons has exercised its option to convert 2.85 crore warrants into shares of Tata Steel at a price of Rs 484.27 per share.

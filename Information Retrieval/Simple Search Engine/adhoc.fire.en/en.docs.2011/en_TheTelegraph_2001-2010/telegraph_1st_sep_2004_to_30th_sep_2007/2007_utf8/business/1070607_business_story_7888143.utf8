 Board picks Sharma as ONGC top boss

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sharma: Good luck

 New Delhi, June 6: R.S. Sharma and Najib Jung have emerged as the front-runners for the post of chairman-cum-managing director in ONGC.

 The Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) has chosen Sharma, who is now the acting ONGC chairman, once again for the top job. 

 Former bureaucrat Jung is the boards second choice. Sharma was also the boards first choice after Subir Raha retired as chairman in May last year. ONGC director (onshore) A.K. Hazarika was the next preferred candidate. 

 However, the Prime Ministers Office had shot down both the names as it wanted a wider set of candidates, including private sector executives and former bureaucrats.

 Jung is a former IAS officer who was a joint secretary in the ministry of petroleum and natural gas when the Congresss Satish Sharma was the minister. 

 ONGCs lucrative mid-sized oil and gas fields were privatised at the time. Reliance Industries got the Panna-Mukta fields, the Ravva oilfields went to the Dhoots of Videocon, while the Essar group bagged the R series fields in the eastern offshore. 

 Jung had later joined the Reliance-run Observer Research Foundation.

 To select a candidate, PESB shortlists two names which are sent to the appointments committee of the cabinet through the Prime Ministers Office and the ministry which administers the PSU. 

 The ministry and the PMO can comment on the recommendations and either support the first choice or overturn it in favour of the second candidate. In rare cases, they could reject both the names.

 It now remains to be seen whether the PMO clears Sharma this time. 

 ONGC officers had threatened to strike work when the PMO had earlier rejected Sharma. The move was criticised by the Left parties too. 

 At that time Sharma had said he would not enter the fray again. 

 However, the petroleum ministry said Sharma could apply again. Sharma ultimately changed his mind and filed for the job. 

 The other members of ONGCs board of directors, including A.K. Hazarika, A.K. Balyan, D.K. Pande and U.N. Bose, and ONGC-Videsh managing director R.S. Butola were also in the race. 

 PESB sources said of the 28 candidates called for the interviews over the past two days, 26 appeared. R.S. Butola, CEO of ONGC Videsh, was absent. 

 The GAIL chairmans post, which fell vacant after Proshanto Banerjis retirement, has been filled up internally, following recommendations by the PESB.

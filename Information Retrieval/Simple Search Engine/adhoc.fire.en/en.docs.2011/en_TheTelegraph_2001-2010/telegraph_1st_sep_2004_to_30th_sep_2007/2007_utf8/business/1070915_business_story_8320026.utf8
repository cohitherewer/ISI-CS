 Good news for airlines in the air

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The government may relax the experience clause Indian airlines need to fulfil before being allowed to fly abroad. 

 Airlines with at least five years of experience, a minimum of 20 aircraft and a paid- up capital of Rs 100 crore can fly abroad now. 

 The civil aviation ministry wants to do away with the five-year experience. However, other ministries favour a minimum experience of three years. 

 No one is now opposed to relaxing the norms for flying abroad, officials said. 

 With Jet being allowed to fly to the Gulf, pressure from rivals such as Kingfisher and SpiceJet has also increased. 

 The civil aviation ministry wants international routes to be opened up based on airlines technical and financial capabilities. Airlines that carry the Indian flag abroad should have good safety records and should be able to pay up dues of international airports on time, officials said. 

 The civil aviation ministry wants all applications for international routes to be cleared on a case-to-case basis. 

 However, other ministries feel a clear-cut formula should be followed. 

 The group of ministers on civil aviation is expected to meet later this month. 

 New airlines such as Vijay Mallyas Kingfisher will benefit the most if the norm is relaxed. Jet was keen to bag the rights to fly to the Gulf before its rivals queued up for lucrative routes abroad. 

 Officials said once Jet was allowed to fly to the Gulf, rivals would also have to be allowed to fly abroad. If that is not done, there will be accusations of favouritism, they added.

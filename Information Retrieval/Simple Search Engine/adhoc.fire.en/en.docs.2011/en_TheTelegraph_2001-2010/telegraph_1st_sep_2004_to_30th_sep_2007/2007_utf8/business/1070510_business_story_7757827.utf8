 Sebi confirms ban on scamsters

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 9: Market regulator Sebi today confirmed the ban on the Jhaveri group and Sugandh Estate and Investment for their role in the IPO scams during 2004-2006.

 In April last year, Sebi had prohibited Kamal P Jhaveri, Parag P Jhaveri and Sugandh Estate from trading in stock markets for cornering disproportionate number of shares of NTPC, TCS, Yes Bank, IL amp;FS, IDFC and Sasken Communication by opening multiple benami demat accounts.

 During the TCS public offer, Sugandh Estate made 4,000 applications. Later, on allocation, it transferred thousands of shares to the demat accounts of Kamal Jhaveri and P. Jhaveri, the Securities and Exchange Board of India said in an order.

 In other cases too, while Sugandh Estate applied for the shares to be allocated in the retail category, they were transferred to the accounts of the Jhaveri group by using unfair means. The appeal of the Jhaveri group against Sebis interim order was rejected by Gujarat High Court.

 As the Jhaveri group did not file any appeal against the high court order, Sebi proceeded with the matter and confirmed its earlier decision to ban the entities from trading in stock markets, including IPOs, it said.

 The market regulator has found the parties guilty of violating the provisions of fraudulent and unfair trade practices relating to the securities market and the provisions of the Sebi disclosure and investor protection guidelines apart from other regulations.

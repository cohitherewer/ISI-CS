 Vodafone move set to get DoT approval

 New Delhi, Feb. 25 (PTI): Vodafone, the worlds largest mobile player by revenue, may have faced a few hurdles in acquiring the controlling stake in Hutch Essar, but is likely to have a smooth sailing in getting government approval.

 We will endorse the proposal when it comes to us from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board for departmental view as the transaction falls well under the guidelines, a senior official of the department of telecom (DoT) said.

 Vodafone should concentrate on getting the press note 1 no-objection certificate (NOC) clearance from Bharti and submit it when it applies for approval, the official said.

 Press note 1 makes it mandatory for a foreign investor to submit an NOC from its existing Indian partner if permission is sought for another venture in the same segment.

 A Bharti spokesperson said, We will support Vodafone in its acquisition of Hutch. Vodafone officials declined to comment on when the company would apply to the board for approval.

 According to the guidelines, foreign investors need FIPB approval to invest more than 49 per cent in telecom companies, while below 49 per cent is under the automatic route.

 Pending a shareholder vote on March 9 and the FIPB approval, the deal could close as early as the first week of April.

 Essar holds a 33 per cent stake in Hutchison Essar, the countrys fourth-largest mobile player. Vodafone agreed to acquire a controlling stake of 67 per cent from HTIL.

 The Hong Kong-based firm had recently told shareholders that the completion of transaction is conditional upon the approval of FIPB to the deal.

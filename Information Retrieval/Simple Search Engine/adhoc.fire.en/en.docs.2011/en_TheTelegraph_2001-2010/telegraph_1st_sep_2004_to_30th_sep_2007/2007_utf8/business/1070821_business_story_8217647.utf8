 Oil officers stick to stand

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Drying up

 New Delhi, Aug. 20: Aviation and transport services across the country could be affected from tomorrow as 45,000 officers of state-run oil firms will go on an indefinite strike after talks with the petroleum ministry on their demands, including higher wages, failed.

 It is very unfortunate that our appeal has not been accepted by the Oil Sector Officers Association (OSOA), petroleum minister Murli Deora said here tonight after a meeting with the officers failed to break the deadlock.

 Deora, however, said all contingency plans, including using retired officers from oil companies, territorial army, and senior officers to man key installations, have been drawn.

 Defence and air force services will not be allowed to be paralysed because of their agitation, he added.

 In Bengal, over 400 officers will participate in the strike. These are employees below the rank of DGM and include those manning oil terminals.

 Officials said the strike is likely to hit operations at the 20 oil depots at Budge Budge, Mourigram, Haldia and on the city outskirts, which supply oil to the citys 350 pumps.

 OSOA, a representative body of officers from nine oil firms such as the ONGC, the IOC, BPCL and HPCL, is seeking merger of 50 per cent dearness allowance with basic pay, release of ad-hoc payment and withdrawal of tax on perquisites such as company-provided accommodation. The officers will strike work from 0600 hrs tomorrow.

 The ministry has not kept its promise of raising wages to stop employee attrition, quot; OSOA convener Ashok Singh said.

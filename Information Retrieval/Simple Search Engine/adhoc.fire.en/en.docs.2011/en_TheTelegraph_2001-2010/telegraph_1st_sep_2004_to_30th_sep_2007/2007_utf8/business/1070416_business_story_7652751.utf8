 Nath on Doha discussions

 Beijing, April 15 (pti): Commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath today said it was important for India and China to take a common and harmonised position on issues of vital importance at the Doha round of wto negotiations.

 The minister, who arrived here today for consultations with Chinese officials, said this was necessary for a successful conclusion to the Doha round of talks.

 During a meeting with about 30 representatives of Indian industries at the Indian Embassy here, Nath said both the countries enjoyed good rapport during the wto negotiations.

 Nath will have official meetings with his Chinese counterpart Bo Xilai as well as the Chinese agriculture minister, Sun Zhengcai, and the chairman of the China council for the promotion of international trade, Wan Jifei, official sources said.

 His meeting with sun assumes significance as new delhi has stated that agricultural markets of developing countries like india cannot be opened to subsidised imports from developed countries.

 India has stressed that subsidies offered by developed countries distorted world prices and thereby adversely impacted on farmers in developing countries.

 On april 12, new delhi hosted the meeting of trade ministers of the g-4 group of countries india, brazil, the united states and the european commission (ec) which reviewed the progress of the doha round of multilateral trade talks since the resumption of the negotiations.

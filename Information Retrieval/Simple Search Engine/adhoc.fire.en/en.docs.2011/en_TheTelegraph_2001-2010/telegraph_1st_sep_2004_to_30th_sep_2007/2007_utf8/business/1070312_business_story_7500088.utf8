 India Inc upbeat on export prospects 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 11: Corporate India says its near-term export outlook has improved. However, rising raw material prices, higher interest rates and rupee appreciation still remain causes for concern.

 The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) has prepared the export survey for the third quarter (October-December 2006). 

 About 78 per cent of the participating exporters said their volumes would increase in the coming six months. Around 32 per cent said that their exports will increase by up to 10 per cent over the next six months.

 Exporters said higher volumes would be on account of more demand in the existing markets along with entry into the new markets. 

 Despite the highly competitive and cost-conscious global market, 44 per cent of exporters expected to reportincrease in prices in the next six months. The increase in export prices is in response to the expected intolerable low realisations on account of higher inputs costs, said Ficci.

 The survey states that Saarc, the UK, West Asia, UAE, European Union and Latin America are the key regions that will see a strong increase in imports from India in the next six months.

 Apart from soaring prices of raw material, a strong rupee and higher cost of credit, the other constraints are inadequate infrastructure, poor power and port facilities and cumbersome customs and excise procedures.

 Around 263 companies participated in the survey. 

 The turnover of the companies that participated in the survey ranged between Rs 1 crore and Rs 10,000 crore. 

 The companies were from sectors such as automobiles, consumer durables, food processing, FMCG, textiles and handicraft.

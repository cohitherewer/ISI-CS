 New Delhi, March 2: The government today signed production sharing agreements with the winners of 52 oil and gas exploration blocks auctioned under the sixth round of new exploration licensing policy (Nelp). It flagged off a $5-billion investment by upstream companies in the countrys oil hunt.

 ONGC signed production sharing contracts (PSCs) for 24 blocks 12 deep sea, two shallow water offshore and 10 onland. It is also a minority partner with the UKs Cairn Energy in one shallow offshore block.

 Oil India Ltd (OIL) signed an agreement for six onland blocks, while it will have shares in two other deep-sea blocks as part of an ONGC-led consortium.

 Reliance Industries signed PSC for seven prime deep-sea blocks, Santos of Australia inked the pact for two deep-sea blocks, while Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation signed up for three. Focus and Petrogas signed PSC for one shallow offshore block each, while Naftogaz inked the pact for three onland blocks, including one in partnership with Reliance Natural Resources Ltd. Essar Oil signed contracts for two onland blocks while Prize Petroleum and Geoglobal inked PSC for one onland block each.

 While an investment of at least $5 billion has been committed in oil and gas exploration in Nelp-VI blocks, the government plans to launch the seventh round by mid-April with the highest number of blocks ever on offer. It could range from 70 to 100 blocks. 

 A total of 110 blocks were awarded in the past five rounds of bidding under Nelp since 2000. These have resulted in 32 discoveries of oil and gas, establishing in-place reserves of 400 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas, petroleum minister Murli Deora said at the signing ceremony.

 Director-general of hydrocarbons V.K. Sibal said the deadline for companies to drill exploratory wells in blocks awarded in Nelp-III and VI rounds would be extended by at least two years because a shortage of rigs was delaying drilling plans. 

 We have proposed that the three-year phase-I exploration can be extended to five years by including two years of Phase-II. The second and third phases of development and production can be combined, he said.

 BSNL prunes tender size

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 18: BSNL has cut the size of its GSM tender, both in terms of the number of lines and value.

 Under the new order, Ericsson and Nokia-Siemens will build a network for 23 million lines at $90 per line. The original order was for 45.5 million lines at $107 per line. 

 The order has both 2G and 3G components; the reduced value was because of the scaling down of the 3G component in a greater proportion than 2G. The cost to BSNL now stands at $2.1 billion, significantly lower than the original order size of $4.87 billion.

 BSNL said the advance purchase order would be placed in a day or two after consultation with telecom minister A. Raja.

 The advance purchase order will be placed either today or tomorrow for 23 million GSM lines to the two successful bidders, Ericsson and Nokia, said BSNL chairman A. K. Sinha. 

 BSNL had placed the initial order in three phases. Under the revised schedule, the tender is in two phases.

 The first-phase order is for 17.5 million lines, the same as in the original tender, comprising 14 million 2G lines and 3.5 million 3G connections. In the original tender, the size of the order for the second phase was 14 million lines comprising 2G and 3G in a 50:50 ratio. This has now been reduced to 5.5 million lines, though the ratio remains the same.

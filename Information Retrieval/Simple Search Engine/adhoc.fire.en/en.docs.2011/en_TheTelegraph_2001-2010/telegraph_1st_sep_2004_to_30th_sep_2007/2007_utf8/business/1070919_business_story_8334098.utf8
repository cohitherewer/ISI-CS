 Paswan date for Kulti visit

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 18: Steel Authority of India Ltd will revive its Kulti Works, Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan said today.

 The plant was part of the erstwhile Indian Iron amp; Steel Company (IISCO). It was closed in 2003. The minister said a strategy was being drawn up for the revival.

 We are trying to figure out what facilities to set up and the investments required, he added.

 Paswan, who was in Calcutta today, said he would visit Kulti on October 16.

 Kulti Works is spread over 850 acres, encompassing 2,300 residential units, a nine-hole golf course and a club. The plant itself is located on 228 acres. 

 The plant was set up in 1870 as Bengal Iron Works Company. It became a part of IISCO in 1936.

 IISCO later became a sick entity and closed Kulti. When revived, Kulti may not be a part of IISCO Steel Plant any more.

 Paswan said there was a possibility that it could be a separate unit of SAIL.

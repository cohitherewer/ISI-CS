 New Delhi, May 28: Hero Honda Motors has launched the Splendor NXG a 100 cc motorcycle to take on Bajaj Auto in the deluxe segment.

 The Splendor NXG has two variants one with spoke wheels and another with cast wheels with price tags of Rs 40,990 and Rs 41,990 respectively (ex-showroom Delhi).

 This is our first launch in 2007-08. The Splendor NXG is a completely new bike with new styling and is different from Splendor Plus. It is going to add to our volumes, said Pawan Munjal, managing director amp; CEO, Hero Honda Motors.

 According to officials, the Splendor Plus (an earlier launch in the series) and the Splendor NXG will continue to coexist in the market. Anil Dua, vice-president - marketing and sales, Hero Honda Motors, said, Some customers may like the design and styling of the Splendor Plus and some others may prefer the new design ... hence we will sell both.

 Hero Honda, which claims to have more than 50 per cent share of the domestic motorcycle market, sells one lakh units more than Bajaj Auto every year. The company intends to widen this gap further with the Splendor NXG, said Dua. According to estimates, the total two-wheeler market is 8.5 million units, of which motorcycles comprise 7.1 million units. Last year, the motorcycle market grew by about 12 per cent.

 The deluxe segment constitutes a little more than half of the total market and Hero Honda has a share of about 67 per cent. 

 The company offers other brands such as the Passion and Glamour in this segment. But the Splendor is the largest selling with 1.1 million being sold in 2006-07.

 Bajaj Auto offers the Platina and Discover in this segment. Hero Hondas operating profit declined 26 per cent year-on-year to Rs 268.7 crore in the fourth quarter of 2006-07 while net sales grew 17 per cent to Rs 2,638.58 crore. 

 Its operating profit margin also declined by 590 basis points year-on-year to 10.2 per cent in the last quarter.

 The companys market share was 49.2 per cent at the end of the fourth quarter compared with 48.2 per cent in the third quarter of 2006-07. Bajaj Autos sales grew 2.4 per cent year-on-year to 634,007 units in the fourth quarter.

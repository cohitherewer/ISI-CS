 Rupee rules firm as call rates stay high

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 21: The rupee continued its upward march against the dollar today amid a liquidity crunch in the banking system that led to a surge in inter-bank call money rates to 85 per cent. The Indian currency soared to an over 19-month high of 43.46 against the greenback, a gain of 29 paise over yesterdays close.

 The huge appreciation in the rupee value was a direct fallout of the cash shortage in the banking system. To meet this deficit, banks have been selling the greenback (and buying dollars), thereby aiding the Indian currency. A call money rate is the rate at which banks borrow from each other to meet their daily needs. The liquidity shortfall in the banking system has been generated primarily because of advance tax outflows, which sucked out nearly Rs 40,000 crore from the banking system. Companies pay their taxes every quarter, leading to some shortfall when such payments are made.

 The cash crunch worsened because of the anticipated public sector bank strike next week, which resulted in foreign banks knocking at the doors of their PSU counterparts for funds. 

 The recent hike in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and a bond auction have also drained away resources from the banking system.

 On Tuesday, call money rates shot up to 60 per cent. According to bankers, call rates opened at 55 per cent and some deals were seen in the range of 80 per cent, the highest in around 11 years. They ended the day at around 75 per cent. These rates are expected to rule firm at least till the first week of April. 

 Sources said with bank unions deferring the strike that was due next week, rates might soften tomorrow.

 Market rally

 The sensex today soared 240 points, extending gains to the third straight day on the back of hectic short-covering by foreign funds.

 Foreign institutional investors are believed to be heavy buyers in the futures and options segment during the day.

 The Bombay Stock Exchange (bse) benchmark sensex rallied smartly after mid-session and touched an intra-day high of 12964.94 before ending at 12945.88, a net rise of 239.94 points, or 1.89 per cent, over yesterdays close of 12705.94.

 The bse bellwether index gained 515.48 points or 4.15 per cent in three days after suffering a loss of about 455 points or 3.5 per cent during last week. National Stock Exchanges nifty also spurted by 66.95 points or 1.81 per cent to close at 3764.55 from its previous close of 3697.60.

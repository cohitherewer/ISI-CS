 City to miss service tax collection target

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 11: The three commissionerates of Calcutta, its outskirts and Haldia are set to miss their service tax collection target of Rs 1,700 crore for 2006-07.

 The growth in service tax collection in Bengal at 50 per cent is lower than the national average of 55 per cent.

 Till February 2007, we had collected around Rs 1,215 crore. Going by last years record in March, we had collected around Rs 350 crore approximately. Accordingly, we revised the target to Rs 1,550 crore for 2006-07, said K. Raghu N. Chary, service tax commissioner, Calcutta. He was speaking at a workshop organised by the CII on VAT implications in supply chain management.

 The target for service tax in Bengal for 2006-07 is around Rs 1,900 crore.

 The growth in collections in other metros such as Mumbai and Chennai has risen between 70 and 75 per cent, Chary noted.

 The number of assessees in Bengal is around 30,000, of which 25,000 is under the three commissionerates in Calcutta. The number of assessees are growing slowly but steadily, said Chary.

 However, the new service tax draft valuation rules have made things more difficult for assessees. Reimbursements are governed by eight conditions, most of which are almost impossible to fulfil.

 These include conditions such as the recipient should have knowledge of payment made to the third party or recipient should be responsible for payment to third party or recipient should use the goods and services received. 

 Tax experts at the CII workshop felt these would add to the confusion.

 If the government is looking at introducing goods and services tax by 2010, the current budgetary provisions with their selectivity in customs, excise and service taxation base does not augur well for a clear roadmap for 2010, said M. Govinda Rao, director of National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, at the workshop.

 IOC clocks profit of Rs 1,059 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Behuria: Optimistic

 New Delhi, Jan. 29: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has clocked a net profit of Rs 1,059 crore for the third quarter of the current financial year ended December 2006 compared with a loss of Rs 6 crore during the same quarter of the previous year.

 IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria said here today that the net profit for the first nine months of the current fiscal was Rs 5,890 crore up from Rs 885 crore for the same period of the previous year. 

 Behuria, however, said that profits were higher due to early issue of oil bonds by the government. The bonds are to compensate the oil marketing PSUs for under-recoveries from sales of LPG, kerosene, diesel and petrol.

 The government issued the bonds very late in the last financial year. Therefore, they were not accounted for in the first three quarters. 

 He said with the decline in international crude prices, IOC was making a profit of Rs 1.89 per litre on petrol sales but still losing 26 paise per litre on diesel. The company was also losing Rs 150 per cylinder of LPG.

 However, the under recoveries are now down to Rs 40 crore per day compared with over Rs 100 crore in the earlier months. 

 This will give some relief not only to the company and the government but also to upstream giants ONGC and OIL which compensate the oil marketing PSUs on their under recoveries.

 The net borrowing of the company till December 31 was Rs 27,846 crore. It was Rs 26,404 crore for the whole of last year. Behuria said the debt-equity ratio has improved to 0.75:1 this year from 0.9:1 during the last fiscal.

 The refining margin is $3.64 per barrel during the fiscal compared with $ 5.16 per barrel in the last fiscal. The difference between product prices and crude prices has been lower during the first nine months of the current fiscal compared to the same period of the previous year, he explained.

 Behuria said that the subsidiary companies of IOC, IBP and Bongaigaon Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd (BRPL), have improved their performances in the third quarter.

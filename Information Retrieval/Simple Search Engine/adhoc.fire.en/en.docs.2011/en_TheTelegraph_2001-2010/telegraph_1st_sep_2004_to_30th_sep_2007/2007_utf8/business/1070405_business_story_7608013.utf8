 Calcutta, April 4: Union Bank will soon frame a policy to offer doorstep banking to its customers in towns. 

 The bank is working on a policy framework to provide doorstep banking services to its urban customers and will announce it soon, the banks chairman and managing director M.V. Nair said here today.

 In February, the Reserve Bank of India advised banks to formulate a scheme with approvals from their respective boards to provide banking services in the premises of customers. The banks would then have to send the scheme to the RBI for its approval.

 The banks are also required to outline the risks involved in providing such services and the rights and obligations of customers to receive doorstep banking services.

 The Reserve Bank has given general guidelines that banks can follow to formulate their respective policy frameworks.

 According to the guidelines, doorstep banking services will include pick-up and delivery of cash, cheques or demand drafts to corporate, institutional and individual customers. Banks can deliver such services either through their employees or through agents.

 We have already taken a number of measures to deliver banking services closer to the doorstep of villagers in remote areas, said Nair. This month, we are going to roll out biometric smart cards for villagers in Uttar Pradesh on a pilot basis. By using these smart cards, villagers can deposit or withdraw money from vending machines that will be installed at local post offices and even at grocery shops, which will be our approved business correspondents, he said.

 We are providing these services in association with Finno, the technology provider for the project. We have also picked up a 20 per cent stake in the company, Nair added.

 Last month, we have entered into an arrangement with India Post to provide loan facilities through 200 post offices in Maharashtra on a pilot basis. If the project proves to be successful, we will replicate it in other states five to six months later, he said.

 The public sector bank is also trying out biometric ATMs for rural areas on an experimental basis in Shivaganga, Tamil Nadu.

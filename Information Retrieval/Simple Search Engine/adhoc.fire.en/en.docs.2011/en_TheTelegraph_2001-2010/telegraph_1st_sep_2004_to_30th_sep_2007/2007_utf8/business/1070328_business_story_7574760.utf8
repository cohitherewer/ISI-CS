 Mallya mulls US take-off

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kingfisher Airlines chairman Vijay Mallya in New Delhi on Tuesday.

 (PTI) 

New Delhi, March 27: Kingfisher Airlines plans to launch an airline in the United States that will enable it to operate flights to India.

 Our application is being compiled by our attorneys and it will be submitted in six to eight weeks, said Vijay Mallya, chief of Kingfisher Airlines. It will take another six months to get the clearances to launch the airline, he said.

 Being only a two-year old airline, Kingfisher is not eligible to fly on international routes. The current rules say a domestic airline can launch global operations only if it has a fleet of 20 aircraft and has operated for five years within India.

 The Mallya-run airlines announcement of US plans comes close on the heels of rival Jet Airways decision to fly to the US by August this year.

 Kingfishers plan to launch an airline in the US and use part of the US quota of flights between the two countries will effectively bypass the Indian requirements that give only two private airlines Jet and Sahara the right to fly out of India.

 Mallya said Kingfisher, which has ordered Airbus A340-500 among others, planned to start long-haul international operations after this wide-bodied plane is inducted. It will be delivered in a year from now, he added.

 On the issue of Kingfisher operating on international routes from India, Mallya said, We continue to request the government to relax the five-year rule.

 He said since the government was permitting foreign start-up carriers to operate in India, it was only logical that new Indian carriers were also allowed to operate abroad. Hopefully, the government will agree, he said.

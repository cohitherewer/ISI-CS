 GHCL buys US home textiles firm

 Mumbai, Feb. 12 (PTI): GHCL has acquired US-based Best Manufacturing Group for $35 million through its international subsidiary GHCL Inc. 

 Best, a New Jersey-based company, manufactures and distributes home textile and accessories for the hospitality and healthcare sectors in the US. The acquisition would be funded through existing lenders of Dan River, another US based textile company which was acquired by GHCL last year.

 This further strengthens our position in the largest home textiles market of the US and provides us with an ideal opportunity to leverage Bests global platform and a renowned global brand to make GHCL one of the dominant players in the home textile space globally, GHCL chairman Sanjay Dalmia said.

 GHCL had earlier acquired H W Baker Lenin, an unit of the Best Manufacturing Group. Dan Rivers revenues will now go up from $250 million(which includes the recent acquisition of HW Baker division) to $400 million.

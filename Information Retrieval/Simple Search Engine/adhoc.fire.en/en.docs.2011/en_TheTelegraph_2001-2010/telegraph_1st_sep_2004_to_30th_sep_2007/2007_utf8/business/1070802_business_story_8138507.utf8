 Guessing game on Murdoch plan

 RICHARD SIKLOS

 New York, Aug. 1: So now what? 

 Since the News Corporations offer for Dow Jones was made public three months ago, Rupert Murdochs business career, character and motives have been dissected in an effort to predict what he might do as the owner of The Wall Street Journal. 

 Despite how long Murdoch has wanted The Journal, he may not have a set playbook, according to interviews and more recent conversations with several people in Murdochs camp, who spoke on the condition they not be identified. Theres a very low probability that theres a grand plan, said one person close to Murdoch.

 But based on his history, there is little doubt that Murdoch will directly aim at luring both readers and advertising away from The New York Times and The Financial Times, The Journals closest rivals. His strategy will probably include aggressively undercutting advertising and investing heavily in editorial content particularly in Washington and international news absorbing losses at first to win the longer-term war. 

 At its most ambitious, Murdochs vision for Dow Jones would establish The Journal as the rival to The Times in setting the daily news agenda of the country. 

 The vision has a business corollary: by broadening The Journals influence beyond pure business readers, Murdoch wants to reposition it as not just the worlds leading financial newspaper, but the worlds leading business journalism source for consumers. 

 The paper has already tried this with softer service features and its Saturday edition. Reorienting the newspaper further for consumers would fit with two other aspirations Murdoch has. One is to build his nascent Fox Business Network, which begins in 30 million US homes this October, into a viable contender with Bloomberg Television and CNBC, which have much larger subscriber bases both at home and abroad. 

 The Journal already has a deal to provide news content exclusively to CNBC, an agreement that the News Corporation discovered is ironclad until 2012. Any move to tie The Journal to the new Fox business channel will require disentanglement. 

 Murdochs second and overarching vision is to resurrect the newspaper industry by integrating print and video online and building brands around the world. 

 Part of that involves tapping into Dow Joness Web properties it owns not just The Journal but also the investing weekly Barrons, Dow Jones Newswires and the consumer-focused Web service MarketWatch.com to create an online platform for all of the companys newsgathering operations around the world. Another part would be using the companys Fox and Sky News video outlets as sources of video content on the new sites. 

 Murdoch has shown in the past that he is willing to experiment, even knock over some sacred cows. In an interview with The Times, Murdoch said he did not have time to read longer articles during the week and might like to swap out The Journals Pursuits section on Saturdays with a glossy magazine. 

 A more immediate change might be felt on the Web side, where The Journal has stood out among newspapers by commanding more than 900,000 paid subscribers. 

 Executives are keen to explore whether more of that content ought to be offered free online to increase the audience and attract advertising, while keeping subscribers by offering more premium services. A more open WSJ.com would be able to attract more advertising, but also potentially distribute that advertising across the News Corporations online footprint.

 In the meantime, the business channel, which is scheduled to begin operation on October 15 under the direction of the Fox News chief executive and chairman, Roger Ailes, is being readied on the presumption that it is a stand-alone business. 

 More recently, he told Time magazine that he was not sure about the offbeat front-page stories known internally as A-Heds that are a plum for reporters to write.

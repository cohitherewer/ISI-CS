 New Delhi, April 17: General Motors India today launched its much-awaited small car, the Chevy Spark, in India. 

 Entry into the small car segment is expected to help the US-based automobile company gain significant market share in India. GM had only a 2.8 per cent market share till March. It hopes to increase this to 10 per cent by 2010.

 On plans to set up an engine manufacturing facility in India, president (Asia-Pacific) Nick Reilly said: Either we will continue to import or manufacture them in India on our own or talk to Suzuki since we have strong relations with them.

 On sourcing auto components from the country, he said, We have been increasing the localisation content in our cars and with rising volumes we will increase sourcing from India over the next four to five years to $1 billion per annum. 

 GM has priced the Spark at Rs 3.09 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) for the base model, slightly lower than Rs 3.21 lakh for Marutis Zen Estillo.

 When asked if the launch of the Spark means stiff competition for Maruti, managing director Jagdish Khattar said Maruti has seen extensive competition in the small car segment. 

 Competition will increase, but ultimately consumers would decide on the success of any model, he added.

 Calcutta, July 20: The Central Bank of India will tap the capital market with an initial public offering of eight crore shares on July 24. The offer, to be made through 100 per cent book building, will close on July 28. The bank has fixed the price band between Rs 85 and Rs 102.

 The bank has a total business of Rs 136,406 crore as on March 31, 2007.

 It aims to raise Rs 816 crore at the upper limit of the price band. The fund will be used to meet its capital requirement to comply with the Basel II norms and support growth in advances.

 The Central Bank has a capital adequacy ratio of 10.4 per cent as on March 31. This will become 9.25 per cent after the Basel II norms are implemented to provide capital against market, credit and operational risks. 

 The minimum capital adequacy ratio under Basel II is 9 per cent.

 The bank needs to raise its Tier-I capital, as it is planning to upgrade to the new standards of risk capital provisioning from March 31, 2008. Its Tier-I capital comprises 6.31 per cent of its capital adequacy ratio.

 The Rs 816 crore we aim to raise will increase our Tier-I capital and this will give us a headroom to raise Rs 400-crore Tier II capital in the future, said Albert Tauro, executive director, Central Bank of India. 

 The bank also needs capital to support its loan growth, which was 38.18 per cent last fiscal. The banks advances as on March 31 this year stood at Rs 51,795.47 crore against Rs 82,776.28 crore in total deposits. 

 The Central Bank has net non-performing assets of 1.70 per cent and gross non-performing assets of 4.81 per cent. It made a provisioning of Rs 326.59 crore towards non-performing assets last fiscal and wrote off Rs 354.3 crore bad debts from its books. 

 However, it also managed to make a cash recovery of Rs 459.6 crore to reduce the NPA level.

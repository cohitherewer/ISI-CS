 Calcutta, Aug. 28: The board of Exide Industries has approved a Rs 150-crore rights issue, to expand long-term resources of the company.

 The enhanced capital will add more floating stock and therefore increase the liquidity of the scrip in stock markets, said T.V. Ramanathan, managing director and CEO of Exide.

 Exide will issue 5 crore shares, which will be allotted in the ratio of 1:15, or one share will be allotted for every 15 held by shareholders. 

 After the issue, the companys equity capital will stand at Rs 80 crore compared with Rs 75 crore now.

 The board has appointed SBI Capital Markets as the lead manager to the proposed issue.

 Exide has crossed market capitalisation of $1 billion on stock markets.

 The company said the rights issue was a long-standing demand of shareholders.

 Exide has also received its boards approval to pick up a 25 per cent stake in Australias Ceil Motive Power for between Aus$1 million and Aus$4 million. Ceil Motive is a distribution, marketing, sales and services company. 

 It distributes Exide traction batteries in the Australian market.

 Traction batteries are used in vehicles like electric forklifts and battery-operated trucks.

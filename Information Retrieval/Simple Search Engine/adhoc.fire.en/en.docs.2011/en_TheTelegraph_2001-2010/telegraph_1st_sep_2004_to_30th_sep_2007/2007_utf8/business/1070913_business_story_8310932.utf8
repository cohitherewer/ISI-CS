 Operators send legal notice to DoT

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Telecom tussle

 New Delhi, Sept. 12: The Cellular Operators Association of India, a body representing GSM operators, today served a legal notice to the telecom department asking it to allocate spectrum to GSM operators on the basis of a criterion earlier laid down by the government. 

 GSM operators are facing a severe spectrum crunch and have been waiting for months and even years, said T.V. Ramachandran, director-general of COAI.

 Ramachandran said some operators had waited for almost three years. Non-availability of spectrum for such long periods is affecting the operators financially, hampering their network expansion and their ability to provide proper service, he said. 

 Idea Cellular, which operates in 11 circles, is among the many operators waiting for spectrum to expand its services. 

 The department of telecom (DoT) had cleared Ideas application to launch its services in Mumbai in August 2006. Idea Cellular was even awarded the letter of intent the same month. Since then the company had been waiting for spectrum.

 Ramachandran said, As several applications for allotment of spectrum, including Ideas, had been cleared by the DoT, then spectrum must be available for allotment. 

 Even after such clearances, the actual allotments are yet to take place, said Ramachandran. 

 The COAI also expressed concern about the applications for new unified access service licences. There has been a flood of applications recently for the scarce resource of spectrum. We are concerned that these companies, which have no telecom background or are unheard of, are actually proxies for established telecom firms, said Ramachandran.

 The COAI has also asked the DoT to lift the corporate veil and find out where the real ownership or control of these companies lie.

 For all licences and applications, the corporate veil has to be lifted to determine the economic entity or promoter group that is the real beneficiary. Licence conditions cannot be circumvented by posing as separate corporate houses, the COAI said. 

 Ramachandran added that the DoT should first address the applications that were already pending with it when it last issued licences in December 2006.

 Tariff hike

 The recent tariff hike by three private mobile operators has ignited a turf war between the telecom regulator and TDSAT, with the regulator contending that the issue does not come under the tribunals jurisdiction.

 TDSAT has no right to pass any direction because the dispute involved is not covered under section 14 of the Trai act, said additional solicitor-general Vikas Singh, appearing for the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.

 During a hearing in the tribunal, Trai also said it was not the right time to step in as the price hike was done only recently.

 India keen to settle wine tiff with US

 New Delhi, June 5 (PTI): India has informed the World Trade Organisation that it is making efforts to resolve the disputes with the US over high rates of duties on wines and spirits.

 Indias representative in Geneva, the WTO headquarters, yesterday blocked the formation of a panel to examine additional duties on wines and spirits as requested by the US.

 India said the US request for setting up a dispute settlement panel was premature since it was still working towards a mutually acceptable solution, according to WTO officials.

 The solution will involve scrapping additional customs duties and allowing the state governments to levy local taxes on imported liquor equivalent to the domestic imports. The issue is likely to be resolved in another month, officials said.

 New Delhi was able to veto Washington, since it was the first US request to establish a panel on this case.

 However, at the second request, the establishment is automatically granted. Blocking the establishment of a panel at the first request is quite common, chief WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell said.

 Both the US and the EU have dragged India to the WTO, complaining that it imposes duties of up to 550 per cent on alcoholic beverages against its bound rate of 150 per cent.

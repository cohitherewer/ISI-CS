 Bourses bash two-wheelers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 7: Shares of automobile companies led by two-wheelers skidded on the stock exchanges today as manufacturers talked about a cut in production because of a demand slowdown.

 The entire two-wheeler pack ended in the negative on the BSE over fears that many of these companies could report weak results during the first half of this fiscal. 

 The share prices of Bajaj Auto and Hero Honda, the two heavyweights in this sector, were down by over 2 per cent with indications coming from these companies that they were slashing or readjusting production. Bajaj Auto was the biggest loser among the two-wheeler scrips. It fell 2.84 per cent to settle at Rs 2,155.25 on the BSE. Hero Honda followed with a fall of 2.3 per cent as it lost Rs 16.45 to close at Rs 697.40. 

 The countrys third largest motorcycle manufacturer TVS Motor fell by 1.62 per cent and closed at Rs 66.90. 

 Inflation and rising interest rates are being seen as major negatives for auto makers across the country. As a large part of vehicles sold are financed by banks, and consumers have been loath to take loans at higher interest rates, it is feared that two-wheeler sales will be hit till the festive season. TVS Motor, Bajaj Auto and Hero Honda are, therefore, planning to prune production in certain segments. Moreover, the monsoon is just the beginning. Generally, sales are sluggish in this period as consumers postpone their purchases, an analyst said. 

 The slowdown is not only restricted to two-wheelers. Tata Motors is facing sluggish demand for its heavy commercial vehicles. The company has made certain adjustments in production because of this.

 Two-wheeler sales for May have been disappointing. TVS Motor sold 108,151 units in May down from 124,678 a year ago, while Hero Honda saw sales slump 6 per cent from 303,444 units a year earlier. Bajaj Auto sold 193,437 vehicles in May, a fall of 13 per cent from 223,455 a year ago.

 On the BSE, even many auto ancillary shares ended in the red.

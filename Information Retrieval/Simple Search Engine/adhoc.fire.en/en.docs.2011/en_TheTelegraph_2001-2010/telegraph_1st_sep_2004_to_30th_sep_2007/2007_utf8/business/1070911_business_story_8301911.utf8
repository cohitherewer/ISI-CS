 Tata BlueScope aims big

 STEEL WILL

 Calcutta, Sept. 10: Tata BlueScope Steel, a 50:50 joint venture between Tata Steel and Australias Bluescope Steel, is targeting a tenfold increase in its business in the next four years. 

 Tata BlueScope has three pre-engineered building and component manufacturing units in Pune, Bhiwandi (near Mumbai) and Sriperumbudur (near Chennai). The units were set up at an investment of Rs 100 crore. 

 The company is also setting up a Rs 880-crore metal-coated steel plant in Jamshedpur. The unit, which will have a capacity of 250,000 tonnes, is expected to go on stream by the third quarter of 2009-10, managing director Chetan Tolia said.

 The plant will make 150,000 tonnes of colour-coated and 100,000 tonnes of zinc aluminium-coated steel. The colour-coated and zinc sheets will be sold under the Colorbond and Zincalume brands owned by BlueScope. 

 Tolia said the company expected to clock a turnover of Rs 1,000 crore in the next three years from Rs 80 crore in 2006-07. We hope to do business worth Rs 250 crore this year, he added. The Jamshedpur unit will use Tata Steels cold-rolled sheets as raw material. The metal-coated products will be sent to the pre-engineered building factories for customisation and then sold. There will also be merchant sale. 

 The pre-engineered building industry is growing by leaps and bounds in India as more and more architects are designing steel buildings. From 10,000 tonnes in 1999, it has now reached 500,000 tonnes, Tolia said. 

 Metal-coated steel, which includes galvanised steel (zinc coated), galvalume or zinc aluminum steel or colour-coated steel, has a market of 4 million tonnes, growing at 15 per cent a year.

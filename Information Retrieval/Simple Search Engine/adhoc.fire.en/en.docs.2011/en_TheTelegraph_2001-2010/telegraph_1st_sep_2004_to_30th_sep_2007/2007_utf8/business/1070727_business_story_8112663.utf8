 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 26: GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals will sell its qualigens fine chemicals (QFC) business to Thermo Electron LLS India, a subsidiary of the US-based Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, for Rs 240 crore.

 The QFC division manufactures and markets a range of fine chemicals, diagnostic kits and laboratory products, including glassware, culture media, instruments and filter papers. QFC has a large distribution network of laboratory chemicals in the country.

 GSK Pharma entered the QFC business in 1968 with the merger of the erstwhile BDH Ltd with Glaxo Laboratories (India) Ltd.

 Thermo Fisher Scientific, with revenues of $9 billion, makes analytical instruments and laboratory equipment. It also provides software and services for research, analysis, discovery and diagnostics. 

 The company operates in 38 countries. 

 Hasit Joshipura, managing director of GSK Pharma, said, Under the GSK umbrella, QFC had an excellent track record, which enabled the business to develop into a market leader. For further growth, infusion of new technology and products are necessary.

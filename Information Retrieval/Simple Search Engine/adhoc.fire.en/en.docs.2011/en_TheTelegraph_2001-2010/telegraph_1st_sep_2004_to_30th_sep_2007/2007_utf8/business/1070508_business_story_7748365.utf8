 Stage set for DLF flotation

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 7: The Securities and Exchange Board of India has finally approved the IPO of real estate major DLF. The issue is expected to fetch Rs 13,600 crore. DLF had filed the prospectus with Sebi a year ago but then got stuck in a litigation that delayed the issue.

 We have received the approval from Sebi. We now need to update the document and file with the registrar of companies, DLF official Ramesh Sanka said. There is no change since the January filing and March updates in terms of information and land bank data. The IPO will hit the market within 90 days, he added.

 DLF will offer 17.5 crore equity shares of Rs 2 each. The price will be determined by book building, and the promoters stake will be diluted by more than 10 per cent after the issue.

 The company will use the proceeds to meet the cost of construction, acquire land and repay debt. DLF had filed the first prospectus in May 2006 to sell 21.9 crore shares. However, the offer was withdrawn in August because of differences with minority shareholders over allotment of debentures.

 The issue was settled in November that led to the revival of the IPO. In its revised documents submitted in January, the company reduced the issue size to 17.5 crore shares. 

 Sources said the company had no plans for a pre-IPO placement of shares.

 Merrill Lynch and Kotak Mahindra Capital Company will manage the sale. 

 The company has a land bank of 10,225 acres one of the largest among real estate majors. However, there is a mixed opinion about the company.

 A report by Macquarie Research says the companys strengths are its presence in 31 cities and the land bank, albeit small, in Delhi and Mumbai.

 On the other hand, the report says its product mix is not in sync with market demand. DLF focuses more on relatively smaller commercial and retail markets instead of the larger residential segment. Even in residential, DLF focuses only on super luxury apartments which have a small market, the report said.

 Meanwhile, the company has tied up with Prudential Financial Inc, a US-based life insurer. 

 The companies plan to invest about Rs 1,000 crore over the next 10 years in India. 

 The new company DLF Pramerica Life Insurance Company (DLF Pramerica) will kick-start operations by early 2008 with a paid-up capital of Rs 100 crore, which is the minimum stipulated capital requirement.

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: Union finance minister P. Chidambaram today rolled out a slew of measures for rural India which constitute the political flavour of the budget. 

 He said the main thrust of the budget was on agriculture. The emphasis comes at a time when the farm sector has run into a crisis with indebted farmers committing suicide and the agricultural growth rate slumping to an abysmal 2.3 per cent. 

 The outlay on agriculture and allied activities, rural development and irrigation and flood control has gone up by 12.6 per cent to Rs 29,467 crore from Rs 26,121 crore in the last budget. The budget provides for massive hike in social sector spending which includes education and health to Rs 80,315 crore which represents a 36 per cent jump over the corresponding figure of Rs 59,143 crore in the last budget. 

 For the first time the finance minister announced a scheme to bring the unorganised landless households under a safety net by providing insurance.

 The scheme, Aam Aadmi Bima Yojana will be launched by the Life Insurance Corporation of India and will provide death and disability insurance, the finance minister said. The Centre will bear 50 per cent of the premium of Rs 200 per year per person. He urged the state governments to come forward to bear the remaining 50 per cent on behalf of the beneficiaries.

 The head of the family or one earning member in the family will be insured under the new scheme which seeks to fulfil a commitment made in the national common minimum programme of the government.

 The government today also proposed to step up funding for the social sector, including its flagship National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme (NREG) and school education programmes.

 The NREG will be expanded from the current level of 200 to 330 districts.

 The government has proposed an initial allocation of Rs 12,000 crore for the scheme.

 In addition, a sum of Rs 2,800 crore will be provided for the Sampoorna Gramin Rozgar Yojana for rural employment in districts not covered by NREGS.

 Nearly 2,000 debt ridden farmers committed suicide through 2006 in Maharashtra, Orissa, Andhra and Punjab marking what must be Indias worst agrarian crisis in decades and the government is worried over the adverse political fallout.

 Govt open to checks on rising rupee

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 TURNING POINT

 New Delhi, June 4: Policy-makers are willing to control the rise in the value of the rupee but are opposed to a full-scale intervention since a strong local currency is a deterrent to inflation.

 They are willing to calibrate the rise of the rupee to ensure that exporters profits are not eroded too much.

 Software giants and small exporters whose earnings have been hit by a rising rupee are demanding government intervention to check the appreciation of the currency against the dollar.

 As the rupee grows stronger against the dollar and other currencies because of the huge forex reserves, the earnings and profits of software firms such as TCS and exporters such as MMTC are falling.

 Corporate India is unhappy with the situation and there is an intense lobbying by exporters to stop the rise. The government, consequently, has said that steps would be taken to protect the earnings of exporters.

 The finance ministry and the Reserve Bank, however, do not want to commit to any level but have promised to step in to contain the speed at which the currency is appreciating. 

 The rupee has appreciated by 9.3 per cent against the dollar this year. The recent hikes in interest rates by the RBI to cool down spending and thus inflation has meant that more dollar investments have come to India. Forex reserves have already crossed $200 billion and the finance ministrys think tank, Institute of Economic Growth, believes that it will reach the $210-billion mark by the middle of this month. 

 The government had in the past followed a deliberate policy of letting the rupee depreciate to help exporters compete against their Southeast Asian and east Asian rivals. 

 But rising FII investments in Indias stock markets, NRI deposits and foreign direct investments in telecom and finance have upset this policy. 

 With the inflation rate rising, the government is not too keen to follow the earlier policy.

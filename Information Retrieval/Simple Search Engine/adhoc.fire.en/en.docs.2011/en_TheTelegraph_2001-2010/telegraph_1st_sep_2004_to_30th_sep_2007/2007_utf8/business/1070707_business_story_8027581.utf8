The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Deep divide on way ahead

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 6: Six months down the road where will the sensex be: below 14,000 or above 17,000?

 Brokerages seem to be split down the middle on this nut-cracker question. Spooky as it may sound, several brokerages believe that the market will tumble by the end of December.

 Noted foreign brokerages like JP Morgan think that the benchmark index is likely to be around 13500 by the end of this year. JP Morgan fears that the sensex will sink because it expects Indian companies to come up with some really disappointing quarterly performances.

 Analysts have already identified the bad apples: information technology and automobiles.

 The rupee has already appreciated by over 6 per cent since the start of April and that spells bad tidings for the IT services companies which may see their margins crumple. In a recent report, Citigroup forecast a downward revision in EPS guidance because of a triple whammy: a stronger rupee, wage increases, and higher visa costs.

 The automobile sector too has been a major laggard in the journey of the sensex from 14,000 to 15,000 as high interest rates led to lower sales. Auto sales are expected to pick up only in the second half of this year.

 The bearish trend is likely to continue, particularly for IT and auto stocks. It is more likely that the forthcoming results will see more negative surprises rather than pleasant ones. For the IT sector, unless they go in for a big acquisition which is the only way to leapfrog and increase margins, the sentiment does not look good, says V .K. Sharma, head of research at Anagram Stock Broking. 

 Sharma expects the sensex to touch the 13500-mark by the end of this calendar year.

 Arun Kejriwal, director of Kejriwal Research and Investment Services, echoes that view. He believes that heres an ominous sign that only a few stocks participated in the latest 1000-point rally.

 If only a few stocks like Reliance Industries and State Bank of India rally, thats a sure sign that a disaster is just waiting to happen, he adds.

 However, Andrew Holland, managing director of DSP Merrill Lynch, isnt one of the Cassandras. 

 While admitting that this rally has taken longer than expected, he said there were dodgy oracles who had warned of a meltdown in stocks on previous occasions as well and had their noses ground in the dust. 

 By the end of this year, the markets will be a lot higher than it is today. I dont see any problem, he says.

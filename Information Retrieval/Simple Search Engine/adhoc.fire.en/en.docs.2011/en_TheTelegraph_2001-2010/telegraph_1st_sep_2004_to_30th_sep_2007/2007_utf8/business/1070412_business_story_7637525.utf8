 New Delhi, April 11: German carmaker Porsche plans to triple its sales in India over the next three years. To achieve this target, the company will increase its dealers in the country to four.

 The company today launched its range of second-generation Cayenne sports utility vehicles comprising the Cayenne, Cayenne S and the Turbo, priced between Rs 49,30,000 and Rs 1.1 crore.

 Porsche sold 160 cars in India last year and hopes to sell 550 by 2010. In the last two years of operations in India, the company sold 290 units.

 This year, the sales target is 200 cars, while for 2008 it is about 240-260. By 2010, we are looking at about 540-550 units across various models, Ashish Chordia, CEO of Porsche India Centre, said. 

 The luxury car market is growing in India. There is an increased awareness about the availability of top-end brands, which should drive up our sales, said Mohamed Rahman, managing director, Porsche India Centre.

 The company, which earlier sold its cars through authorised dealers, has set up a subsidiary in India. 

 We have incorporated Porsche Cars India as our subsidiary, Chordia said. The company is looking at adding three dealers in south India this year. The company has one dealer in Delhi, which is setting up another showroom in Mumbai. 

 Within the next two months, our Mumbai showroom will open. We will add one dealer each at Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai. By year-end, we will have four dealers and five showrooms in the country, he said.

 Porsche plans to launch the Panamera its four-door coupe globally in 2009. It will also be introduced in India simultaneously.

 The companys other models include the Boxster, Carrera 911 and the Cayman. 

 Rahman said Porsche would launch at least two variants of existing models this calendar year.

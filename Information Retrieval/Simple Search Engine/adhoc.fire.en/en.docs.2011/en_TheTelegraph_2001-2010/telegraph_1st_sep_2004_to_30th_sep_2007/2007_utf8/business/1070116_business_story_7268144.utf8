 Sensex scales new peak

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 15: The sensex maintained its scorching pace for the third consecutive session to set a new record at 14129.64, up 73.11 points on strong global cues, coupled with favourable developments on the economic front.

 The 30-share bellwether index also hit a new intra-day high of 14202.12 before closing with a 0.52 per cent rise over Fridays close of 14056.53. 

 The sensex has advanced 767.48 points, or 5.74 per cent, in the last three days, from a close of 13362.16 on January 10.

 According to market watchers, certain technical patterns suggest that the journey to 15000 might not take much time with the sensex having consolidated well in the 13000 to 14000 region.

 The broader nifty also closed at a new high of 4078.40 from its last close of 4052.45, a net gain of 25.95 points or 0.64 per cent.

 Todays rally was mostly led by Reliance Industries on the back of hectic buying in the scrip on speculation that the company is likely to split the face value of its stock. The company, however, denied this.

 The shares of Reliance Industries, with a market capitalisation of more than Rs 1.9 lakh crore, touched a lifetime high of Rs 1,372.30 today on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The scrip gained Rs 24.55 or 1.83 per cent to close at Rs 1,364.65 amid a volume of 12.18 lakh shares. On the National Stock Exchange, the scrip gained Rs 25.45 or 1.90 per cent to close at Rs 1,364.95.

 Since the scrip started trading after the demerger on January 18 last year, it has gained almost 98 per cent. On that day, the scrip had opened at Rs 702.90 and closed at Rs 693.85. The company is going to announce its third-quarter results on Thursday.

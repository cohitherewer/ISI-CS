 Import rule tweak to cement Pak ties

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Pillai: The road ahead

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: India will relax norms for cement import from Pakistan to boost bilateral trade.

 At a meeting held here today, the two countries also agreed to end a row over the ownership of the Basmati brand of rice and agreed to jointly file an application for geographical indication of the same. This will help end the dispute between rice traders from the two countries in international markets.

 India and Pakistan will set up a technical committee which will work on the joint application.

 Commerce secretary G. K. Pillai led the Indian delegation in the two-day talks, while his Pakistani counterpart, Syed Asif Ali Shah, led the team from the neighbouring country. 

 Regarding cement, India agreed to make changes in regulations to accept third-party certification for imports. 

 India wants to import cement from Pakistan to meet domestic requirements, but shipments are sometimes delayed because of the quality certification procedure followed by the Bureau of Indian Standards.

 Pakistan also welcomed Indias decision to set up a task force to address its complaint that rules such as quality standards act as barriers to export of its goods such as cement.

 India has given Pakistan a list of 484 items to be included in the positive list of products that should be allowed to be traded with the country. 

 Trade between Pakistan and India has grown phenomenally in the past few years, which could rise to $10 billion by 2010, said Pillai.

 Bilateral trade nearly doubled to $1.67 billion in the financial year ended March 31 this year from about $850 million a year earlier.

 Our bilateral trade has grown phenomenally in the past few years, said Pillai, adding it could rise to $10 billion by 2010.

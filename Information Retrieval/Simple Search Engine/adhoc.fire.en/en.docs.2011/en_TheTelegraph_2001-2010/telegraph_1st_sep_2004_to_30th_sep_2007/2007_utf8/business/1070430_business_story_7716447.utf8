 Selloff breather for oil MNCs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 29: The Centre may drop the norm that makes it mandatory for foreign oil marketing companies to divest 26 per cent of their equity over a five-year period.

 The oil ministry is keen to remove this stipulation, and the commerce ministry is reportedly in favour of the proposal. 

 According to Press Note 4 (2006), issued by the commerce ministrys department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP), 100 per cent foreign direct investment is allowed in refining and marketing in the private sector.

 However, a foreign company, which is only into marketing, must sell 26 per cent of its stake to its Indian partner or to the Indian public.

 The oil ministry now feels it is not necessary to stick to this rule.

 Sources said the ministry has raised the issue in various meetings with the DIPP and has even made a formal proposal to drop the norm.

 The ministry is believed to have supported Anglo-Dutch company Shell when its proposal for a 100 per cent marketing subsidiary in India came up before the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB). 

 Shell wants to set up a liquefied petroleum gas unit which will be involved in a wide range of activities, from imports to bottling and marketing.

 In its proposal, Shell sought to be relieved of the obligation to divest its equity.

 The oil ministry backed Shell and said it would favour the withdrawal of the norm.

 However, the DIPP opposed the ministry. 

 It said the divestment rules for foreign oil marketing companies were part of the FDI policy and that it did not support the proposal to drop the clause from the policy.

 The DIPP argued that any relaxation would encourage oil MNCs to invest in marketing at the expense of refining.

 The ministry of petroleum and natural gas and the DIPP are not locking horns for the first time over this issue. 

 Earlier, the FIPB had overruled the DIPPs views that deletion of the divestment clause should not be overlooked. 

 Reports had then said the FIPB waived the 26 per cent divestment condition for lubricant maker TotalFinaElf of France.

 The FIPB granted the waiver citing petroleum ministrys views that 100 per cent foreign equity in the sector was permissible under the automatic route.

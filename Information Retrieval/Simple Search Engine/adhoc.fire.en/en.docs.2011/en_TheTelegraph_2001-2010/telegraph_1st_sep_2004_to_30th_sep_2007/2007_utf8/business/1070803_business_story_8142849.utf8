 ChrysCapital picks six sectors for cash course

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 2: ChrysCapital, a leading private equity fund, has raised $1.25 billion, which will be invested across six sectors in India. 

 ChrysCapital manages over $2.25 billion across five funds, including the new fund, which closed on July 31. ChrysCapital is now the largest India-focused private equity fund. 

 Proceeds from the new fund will be invested across six sectors, including business services, consumer services and goods, pharmaceuticals and healthcare, manufacturing, infrastructure and financial services, managing director Sanjeev Kaul told The Telegraph. 

 Though ChrysCapital has not fixed any timeframe for investing this money, it will soon start looking at potential companies, Kaul added. 

 ChrysCapital has made over 40 investments across various sectors since 1999. 

 The firm has followed a strategy of investing $10-75 million in profitable companies with revenues between $25 million and $500 million. Last year, it invested $29 million in Centurion Bank of Punjab and this investment was part of a larger private equity placement of $85 million. Some of its other investments include that in Simplex, Suzlon, Shriram Group, Idea Cellular, MphasiS, Spectramind and UTI Bank among others. 

 According to Ashish Dhawan, senior managing director of ChrysCapital, Our performance has been amongst the best globally. We have proven to our global investors that India is an extremely attractive investment destination. With Fund V, we will now be able to deploy larger amounts of growth capital as well as explore buyout opportunities.

 ChrysCapital has a team of 13 investment professionals. 

 ChrysCapital is not the only private equity fund that is bullish on India. Others such as the Blackstone and The Carlyle Group had earlier lined up plans to invest over $ 1 billion each in the country. 

 Texas Pacific Group and Citigroup Venture Capital are also interested in India. 

 Reports quoting data compiled by Thomson Financial say private equity investments into the country during this year have touched around $2.50 billion against $1 billion in Hong Kong, $1.48 billion in Singapore and $752 million in China.

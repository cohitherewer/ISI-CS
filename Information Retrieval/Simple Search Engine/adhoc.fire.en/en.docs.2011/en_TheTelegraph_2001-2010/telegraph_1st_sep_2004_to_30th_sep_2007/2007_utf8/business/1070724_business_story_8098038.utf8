 Power merger to help Barak Valley cut cost

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, July 23: Assam-based Barak Valley Cements Ltd is planning to merge its wholly owned subsidiary Badarpur Energy Private Ltd with itself.

 Badarpur Energy is setting up a 6mw biomass-based power plant for captive use by Barak Valley Cements.

 The company requires about 2mw electricity and the power is drawn from the Assam State Electricity Board at a price of Rs 3.75 per unit and from diesel generator sets for Rs 9 per unit.

 Bijay Kumar Garodia, chairman and whole-time director of Barak Valley Cements, said the Badarpur Energy plant was the first biomass power unit in the Northeast.

 It is being set up at a cost of Rs 24 crore and will go onstream from the first week of next month.

 Garodia said cost escalations and time overruns had pushed up the project cost to Rs 24 crore from Rs 21 crore. However, the captive power plant will help Barak Valley Cements save 50 per cent of its energy cost which constitutes 18 per cent of the total cost of cement manufacturing.

 While Barak Valley Cements will consume 2-3mw from the biomass plant, the power unit itself will require 1-2mw to run its generators and other equipment. The remaining 2-3mw power will be sold to the power grid, said another official of Barak Valley.

 Garodia said the Badarpur Energy power plant would require 200 tonnes of raw materials such as rice husk, beetle nut covers and bamboo chips on a daily basis. 

 While raw materials are quite abundant in the neighbourhood, we are acquiring 2,000 acres to undertake plantations of our own to ensure the uninterrupted supply of raw materials to the power plant.

 The company is also exploring the possibility of purchasing some existing tea gardens in Silchar and adjoining areas. 

 Garodia said the plans were to grow tea on one-third of the land, while the rest of the area would be used for other plantation activities.

 There are plans to do tea marketing as well. The company is also keen on producing power from biomass on a higher scale of up to 10mw for non-captive use.

 The Assam government gives subsidy for setting up such projects.

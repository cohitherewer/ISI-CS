 New Delhi, July 29: Mango variants such as the Alphonso, Kesar, Langra and Chausa are all set to be served on a global platter.

 The government is planning to promote the summer fruit through exhibitions, seminars and campaigns all over the world. Efforts are also on to acquire the global indication stamp for the Alphonso. This means that this variety will be legally protected and no other country can name any other type as Alphonso. Alphonso mangoes are grown mainly in the Konkan and Ratnagiri region.

 In 2006-07, mango exports touched Rs 130 crore. This figure is expected to go up by 10 per cent in the current season. A.S. Rawat, general manager of the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (Apeda), told The Telegraph. 

 Many countries, which earlier had reservations about Indian mangoes being infected by pests, have certified them to be safe. In June 2006, Japan lifted its 20-year-old ban on Indian mangoes, followed by the US in April this year. Japan imported around 110 to 130 tonnes of mangoes from India while the US imported around 200 tonnes worth Rs 2 crore.

 Most mango-growing states are joining hands with Apeda to promote the fruit. However, Bengal, which is home to several exotic varieties such as the Himsagar and Malda, is not playing an active role in the promotion of the fruit. 

 Senior Apeda officials said, The Bengal horticulture development corporation has not shown much interest in the campaigns and seminars we hold for mangoes. The state nodal agency is focused more on potatoes and pineapples.

 Ranjan Kedia, CEO of Radha Krishna Impex Pvt Ltd, said, A farmers profits can increase up to 40 per cent after mango exports from India take off in the next couple of years.

 Kedia said back-end operations have to be taken care of before the exports pick up. He also added that it was important to utilise farm resources and improve farm practices. Indians accept black soot (black patches) on mangoes. However, such mangoes will be rejected in foreign countries, he said.

 India also exports around 1.5 to 2 lakh tonnes of frozen mango in the form of pulps, juices and tidbits. Processed mango exports are worth Rs 400 crore.

 The UAE is the biggest consumer of Indian mangoes, followed by Bangladesh and the UK. In 2005-06, India exported mangoes worth Rs 73 crore to the UAE, Rs 27 crore to Bangladesh and Rs 5 crore to the UK.

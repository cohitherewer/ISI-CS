 New Delhi, Jan. 12: Hyundai Motors India (HMI) will launch its second compact car and the diesel Getz by the end of this year. 

 Both the compact car and the Getz-diesel will be launched before the end of this calendar year. The Getz will probably have a Common Rail Direct Injection (CRDi), Arvind Saxena, vice-president (marketing and sales) of HMI, said here today.

 The compact car, code-named Project PA, is under development. It will be manufactured in the country and also exported. The sedan, to be built on a new platform, is likely to have a new powertrain and design. Hyundais other compact car is the Santro, its flagship brand.

 Company sources said the Getz, which is manufactured in India and Korea, would likely be made exclusively in India from this year. 

 A senior company official said the new compact car would not lead to the phase out of the Santro, which is very well accepted in India. 

 Meanwhile, with an eye on the diesel market, which is pegged at 30 per cent of the market, Hyundai today rolled out the diesel version of its premium sedan, the Sonata. 

 The car, which has a 2.0L CRDi engine, is priced at Rs 14.75 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi), the most competitively priced sedan in the lower D segment.

 The Sonata Embera will compete with Skodas Laura, which is priced in the range of Rs 15.6-17 lakh. The Octavia diesel is available in the range of Rs 11-14 lakh. Toyotas Corolla and Camry and Hondas Civic and Accord do not have diesel versions.

 Saxena said the firm would revise prices in the next two to three months. He, however, refused to specify the increase. 

 H. S. Lheem, managing director of Hyundai Motors, said the company expected 60-70 per cent of the total Sonata sales to come from the diesel variant in the next few months.

 HMI expects to sell around 75 to 100 diesel variants in the next two to three months.

 Lheem said the Verna, launched in September last year, has been received well, with sales already touching 10,000 units. 

 The diesel version of the Verna constitutes 60-70 per cent of its total sales.

 The company sold 2,99,513 cars in 2006, an 18.5 per cent rise from the previous year. Sales in the domestic market rose 19.1 per cent to 186,174 units in 2006, while exports rose 17.4 per cent to 113,339 units.

 Hyundais manufacturing plant near Chennai produces 3 lakh cars a year. Its second plant, which will start production in 2007, will double this capacity.

 The company is investing $500 million in a new engine and transmission plant with a capacity of 4 lakh units a year.

 Hyundai will also start operations of its new research and development centre at Hyderabad next month.

 It will focus on computer-aided design (CAD), analysis and software developments, while the Chennai R amp;D unit will continue to focus on testing and related activities, Lheem said.

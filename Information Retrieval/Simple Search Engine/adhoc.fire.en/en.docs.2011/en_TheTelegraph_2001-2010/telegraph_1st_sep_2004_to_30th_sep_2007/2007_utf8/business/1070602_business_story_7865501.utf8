 Tatas to pay Rs 210cr for stake in Everest

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 1: Tata Tea will fork out Rs 210 crore to pick up a 45.74 per cent stake in Mount Everest Mineral Water Company, owners of the bottled mineral water brand Himalayan.

 The company has signed an agreement with the promoters of Mount Everest under which it will pay roughly Rs 44 crore to purchase a 10.74 per cent stake (a little over 31 lakh shares) at a price of Rs 140 per share.

 It will pick up another 15 per cent for about Rs 70 crore by subscribing to a preferential issue of 50.9 lakh shares at the same price.

 The company will also come out with a mandatory open offer that opens on June 4 to acquire an additional 20 per cent. This will cost Rs 100 crore if fully successful. The open offer will be managed by Merrill Lynch. 

 Mount Everest originally belonged to Dadi Balsara, but was later acquired by a group of investors who together hold 21.5 per cent of the equity. The financial institutions hold 27.8 per cent, while the public holds the rest. The company has a bottled manufacturing unit in Himachal Pradesh. 

 Pradeep Poddar, CEO of Tata Tea, said, We have identified water and beverages as a potential vertical and we will always look for new opportunities in this arena. Himalayan has been on Tata Teas radar for quite some time now. 

 The bottled water business is growing at a rate of over 30 per cent in India, and at about 9 per cent in the international market. So, we have a huge business platform there.

 Tata Tea will take the debt route to raise funds for the acquisition.

 Refusing to disclose the name of the lenders, Tata Tea vice-chairman R.K Krishnakumar said, quot;It is always better to have some debt on the business portfolio. To finance the deal as a borrower, we would pick up the best deal. It would take about 90 to 100 days to close the deal, starting from June 4.

 Tata Tea is also in the process of transferring its north India plantation division to Amalgamated Plantations Private Ltd (APPL) at a consideration of Rs 359 crore, pursuant to approvals from the Calcutta High Court. 

 The company said its net profit rose almost 64 per cent to Rs 307 crore during the year ended March 31 against Rs 187 crore in the year-ago period.

 Income grew 9 per cent to Rs. 1070.35 crore from Rs. 982.05 crore in the previous year. 

 During the quarter ended March 31, the company saw its net profit decline by almost 80 per cent at Rs. 3.89 crore against Rs. 19.32 crore.

 However, the companys income for the quarter rose by about 15 per cent at Rs. 251.23 crore as compared with Rs. 219.07 crore last year. 

 The company has recently announced that cash of $1.2 billion acquired through the sale of its stake in Energy Brands Inc to Coca Cola, would be utilised to repay debt and make investments around the world.

 The company has recommended a dividend of 150 per cent for the financial year, which is higher than previous years 120 per cent. 

 The Tata Tea stock rose 3.49 per cent to close at Rs. 952.45 on the NSE today.

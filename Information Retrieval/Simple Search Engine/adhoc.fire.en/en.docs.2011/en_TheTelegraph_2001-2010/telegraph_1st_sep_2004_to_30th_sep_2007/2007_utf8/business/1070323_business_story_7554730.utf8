 Reliance in pact for Jamnagar acrylic unit

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, March 22: Reliance Industries has signed up US-based Rohm and Haas to establish a world-scale acrylic-monomer complex in Jamnagar.

 The proposed facility will make approximately 200,000 tonnes of acrylic acid and esters annually. 

 While the key objective would be to serve the domestic market, the complex could also export acrylic acid and derivatives.

 Reliance is believed to be in talks with several companies, including Dow Chemicals and Nova Chemicals, to form joint ventures for petrochemical projects in Gujarat.

 In January, Reliance Industries had announced during the investment summit organised by Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi that the group intended to invest Rs 67,000 crore in Gujarat over the next few years. The scale of investment in the monomer plant was not immediately known. 

 Materials from the facility are intended to serve as building blocks for environmentally advanced products for paints and coatings, packaging adhesives, detergents, textiles and construction materials. The new facility is expected to spur development of super absorbent polymers, used in the manufacture of baby diapers. 

 The proposed plant is expected to be world-scale, will be located at a site with world-class infrastructure, and use Rohm and Haass leading technology.

 Q amp;A

 Refund trouble

 Is the interest income on post office monthly income scheme taxable? I had claimed refund of tax for the assessment year 2005-06. But I have not received any refund or intimation of the same. What should I do to get the refund?

 Samir Bhattacharya, Calcutta

 Yes. Interest income on post office monthly income scheme is taxable. However, tax is not deducted at source. The onus is on the depositor to show this interest income as income from other sources in his/her income tax return and pay the tax accordingly. When it comes to refund of tax, the income tax department is as indifferent as any other government department. You can approach the officer-in-charge of the Taxpayers Grievance Cell with your income tax circle office.

 Share sale

 I purchased 10 shares of Satyam Computers at the rate of Rs 804.44 a share in April last year. In October, I got 10 bonus shares of the company. I want to sell the original 10 shares. What would be the cost of acquisition for calculating capital gains?

 Hari Nath Ghose, Calcutta

 Hope that you had bought these shares through a broker and had paid security transaction tax on the same. The good news for you and all equity investors is that there is no long-term capital gains tax on investments in equities, provided the security transaction tax has been paid. Since the original stocks are in your possession for more than 12 months, any capital gains that you will get by selling those shares now will be considered as long-term capital gains. You dont need to do any kind of cost indexation.

 Medical reimbursement

 I am a retired government employee. I get a pension of Rs 1,000 per month. I have no other income. I have stopped filing income tax return from the date of retirement. I dont have a PAN either. My employer also reimburses my medical expenses till date. If such reimbursement exceeds Rs 15,000 in a year, they deduct income tax on such excess reimbursement. Can I get refund of the tax so deducted?

 D. Tarafdar, North 24 Parganas

 The maximum tax exemption that an individual can get on medical reimbursement (and not on medical allowance) is Rs 15,000. Any reimbursement above that limit is taxable.

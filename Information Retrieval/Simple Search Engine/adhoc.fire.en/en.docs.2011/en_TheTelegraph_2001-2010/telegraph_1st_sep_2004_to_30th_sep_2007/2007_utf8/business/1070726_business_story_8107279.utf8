 Ryerson gets a suitor

 New York, July 25 (Reuters): Steel services company Ryerson Inc, which put itself up for sale earlier this year under pressure from activist investors, agreed to be sold to Platinum Equity for slightly more than $1 billion.

 Ryerson said the private equity firm would pay $34.50 per share. 

 Hedge fund Harbinger Capital Partners, which announced in December that it owned Ryerson shares and was considering a variety of actions, said it was unhappy with the terms. 

 We are disappointed with the price and we are reviewing our options, Dan Gagnier, a spokesman for Harbinger, said. 

 Harbinger has been running a proxy battle to replace Ryersons board of directors and sued the company last month to hold its annual meeting, saying it had delayed for too long.

 The company said the deal was worth $2 billion.

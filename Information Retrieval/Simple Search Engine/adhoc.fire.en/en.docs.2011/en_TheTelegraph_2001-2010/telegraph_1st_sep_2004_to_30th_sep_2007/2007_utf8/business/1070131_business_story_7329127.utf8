 Seal on airline merger soon

 Joint flight

 Mumbai, Jan. 30 (PTI): The merger of Air-India and Indian is expected to be cleared by the Union cabinet by the end of February, with the committee of secretaries submitting its recommendations to the group of ministers.

 The group of ministers, headed by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, is likely to meet shortly to give its finishing touches to the recommendations before sending it for cabinet approval, an aviation industry source said.

 Air-India and Indian are the countrys international and national carriers respectively.

 The merger of the two airlines into a new entity now requires only the final approval of the Union cabinet and is likely to be completed by end-February, the source said.

 It will also be one of Asias largest with a fleet strength of more than 100 aircraft, the source said.

 The committee of secretaries has cleared the merger and submitted its recommendations to the group of ministers addressing the issues raised by the latter, thus paving the way for the merger, the source said.

 V. Thulasidas, Air-Indias chairman and managing director, said the GoM would meet shortly and send its proposal to the cabinet. He did not give a timeframe as to when the merger would be approved. Thulasidas said after cabinet approval is received, the two carriers would take the legal steps necessary for the merger which should be completed within the next 3-4 months.

 But complete operational and manpower integration will take 12-18 months. Total integration of the two carriers would be completed by 2008.

 The merged entity will have one chairman and one board of directors. This will enable it to leverage effectively the synergies realised through the merger in the market, which Thulasidas feels has become highly-competitive.

 We will be adding more aircraft, besides introducing new routes, Thulasidas said, adding the advantages accruing from the merger would comprise additional capacity, additional routes and staff rationalisation as excess staff could be deployed on new routes.

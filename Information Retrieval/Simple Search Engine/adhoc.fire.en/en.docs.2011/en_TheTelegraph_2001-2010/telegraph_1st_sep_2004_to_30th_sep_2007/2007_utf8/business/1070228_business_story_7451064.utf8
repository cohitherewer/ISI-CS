 Farm growth linked to reforms

 Rich harvest

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: The Economic Survey is upbeat on agriculture over the short term as the prospects are good for the rabi season.

 However, in the medium term, growth will be determined by reforms, investments, incentives and development of post-harvest technology.

 The ability to increase investment in surface irrigation, groundwater recharge, restoring water bodies and developing high-yielding varieties of non-cereal food crops will be other key factors to determine the prospects in the medium term.

 According to the survey, agriculture and allied sectors will grow by 2.7 per cent in the current fiscal, substantially lower than the quick estimate of 6 per cent for 2005-06.

 The share of agriculture in GDP declined to 18.5 per cent, while the share of services and industry increased substantially. 

 After an annual average of 3 per cent in the first five years of the new millennium starting 2001-02, growth of agriculture at only 2.7 per cent in 2006-07, on a base of 6 per cent in the previous year, is a cause of concern, the survey said.

 The reforms must aim at efficient use of resources and conservation of soil, water and ecology on a sustainable basis and in a holistic framework, it said. 

 The framework should incorporate financing of rural infrastructure such as roads, water and power.

 In foodgrains, the survey said foodgrain output could fall short by 11 million tonnes (mt) from the target of 220 million, putting further pressure on food prices.

 Poor agricultural performance as demonstrated in the current year, can complicate maintenance of price stability with supply-side problems in essential commodities of day-to- day consumption, the survey said. 

 However, the estimated output at 209.2 mt is marginally higher than the output of 208.6 mt in 2005-06.

 Food items like wheat, pulses and sugar were behind the high inflation rate, which touched 6.7 per cent early this month.

 Meanwhile the prospects for the kharif crop improved with the rains which led to early sowing of wheat in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.

 With a welcome rainfall in early february, prospects of wheat and other rabi crops have brightened, it said. 

 Wheat production is estimated at 72.5 mt against 69.4 mt in 2005-06. However, the target for the crop was higher at 75.5 mt.

 The output of rice is likely to slip to 90 mt in 2006-07 from 91.8 mt in the previous year. The target for the current year is 92.8 mt.

 Production of pulses too may fall short of the target. The output is 14.5 mt, against the target of 15.1 mt. 

 Production of cotton, sugarcane, jute and mesta will set a new record in the current year. The output of cotton is likely to increase to 21 million bales in 2006-07 from 18.5 million bales, while the sugarcane output is set to rise to 315.5 mt from 270 mt.

 However, the production of oilseeds is expected to decline by 15.7 per cent to 23.6 mt from 28 mt.

 The share of the farm sectors capital formation in GDP dipped from 2.2 per cent in the late 1990s to 1.9 per cent in 2005-06. 

 While the survey was positive about crop production in the country, the lower yield compared with the global average continues to be a cause of concern.

 Low yield per unit area across almost all crops has become a regular feature of Indian agriculture, it said.

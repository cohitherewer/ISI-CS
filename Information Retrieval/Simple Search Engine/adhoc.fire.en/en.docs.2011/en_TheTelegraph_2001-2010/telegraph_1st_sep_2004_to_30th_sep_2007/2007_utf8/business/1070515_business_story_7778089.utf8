 Maran exit not to halt telecom march

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 14: The telecom industry has already started looking ahead after Dayanidhi Marans sudden and dramatic resignation as Union minister for IT and communications after a bitter wrangle within the DMK party. 

 Maran had set a new agenda this year: launch 3G services in the country and ensure zero roaming rates and he had given himself two years to achieve his goals. Industry mavens reckon that Marans successor will be able to run with the ball just as quickly. 

 The government as a whole is committed to the telecom industry and is likely to remove all the impediments it faces, said Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal. He felt that Marans resignation would not affect the entry of foreign players in 3G mobile services and the allocation of spectrum.

 The abolition of roaming charges and unified charges for telecom services are the two issues that industry is pitching for at a time when 7 million mobile phones are being added every month to the subscriber base which swelled to 206 million as on March 31, 2007, from 76.5 million two years earlier. 

 I was planning to abolish roaming as a mark of respect to my leader, M.Karunanidhi on his birthday on June 3... But now this will not happen, Maran said in Chennai today.

 Whoever succeeds Maran will simply have to complete an agenda on which there is wide consensus.

 A. Raja, currently minister for environment and forests, is the most likely choice though some mention the name of shipping minister T. R. Balu. 

 Industry observers say Marans dream of hosting servers in India to allow free broadband for unlimited downloads could now take a backseat. 

 Maran, whose policies and proposals were seen as pro-consumer, last year brought down the STD charges in the country to one rupee through BSNLs OneIndia plan. 

 The telecom industry, however, did not approve of this move as tariff rates in India were already among the lowest in the world.

 Industry officials acknowledge that getting cabinet colleagues to agree to raise the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in telecom from 49 per cent to 74 per cent was one of his major achievements. 

 This had an immediate effect on global players entering India to manufacture handsets and networking equipment. Most of them established their factories on Marans turf Chennai. 

 Alcatel, Nokia, Siemens, Flextronics, Ericsson all announced million dollar manufacturing and R amp;D units in Chennai. Cisco announced it would set up its lab in Chennai for e-governance and networking. Maran also convinced Dell to set up a $60million manufacturing unit in Chennai. 

 Maran has been instrumental in reinforcing Indias position as the premier destination for IT outsourcing and hardware industry, said Kiran Karnik, president of Nasscom.

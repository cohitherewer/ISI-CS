 GE to buy aerospace unit for $4.8bn

 Jeff Immelt: Smart move

 London, Jan.15 (Reuters): General Electric (GE) has agreed to buy Britains Smiths Groups aerospace business for $4.8 billion. The move is part of GEs plans to capitalise on a flood of new plane orders and robust US military spending. 

 The two firms said on Monday that they had also agreed to set up a joint venture for their detection and security businesses, to be owned 64 per cent by Smiths and 36 per cent by GE. 

 Smiths aerospace unit makes equipment for planes, ranging from Airbus A380 superjumbo to the Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The company said it planned to return 2.1 billion ($4.1 billion) of the proceeds from the sale to shareholders. 

 That will come from expected net proceeds of 2.25 billion and will be done through a B shares scheme and share consolidation, Smiths said in a news release. 

 The deal is conditional on European and U.S. regulatory approval and backing from Smiths shareholders. 

 Smiths shares soared by more than 16 per cent. This acquisition is consistent with our strategy to invest in high-technology infrastructure businesses that deliver strong growth, earnings expansion and higher margins, GE chairman and chief executive Jeff Immelt said. 

 High demand 

 The aerospace industry is benefiting from strong plane orders due to new projects by Boeing and Airbus. 

 Both these companies have also stepped up outsourcing, but large projects such as Airbus superjumbo and Boeings mid-sized 787 are increasing competition and costs. 

 Smiths aerospace unit has been hit by higher development costs, for example, due to its role on the A380. 

 The structure of the aerospace industry is changing in particular its increased capital requirements and the growing importance of supplier scale, especially as the next generation of large programmes kicks in, Smiths chief executive Keith Butler Wheelhouse said in the companys statement. 

 Evercore Partners, Credit Suisse and JP Morgan Cazenove acted as financial advisers and brokers to Smiths. 

 Theres a lot more risk in the aerospace components business than there used to be and you have to have more capital, which is why GE is a perfect home for a business like this, said one analyst, who declined to be named. He added that Smiths had got a fairly good price for the unit.

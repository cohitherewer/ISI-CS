 Global firms buy 10% of MCX

 Mumbai, Sept. 28 (PTI): Global financial services firms Merrill Lynch and Citigroup have picked up 5 per cent each in the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) for a total consideration of Rs 480 crore.

 Financial Technologies (India) Ltd, the parent company of MCX, sold the stake. 

 Financial Technologies has also entered into agreements to offload another 3 per cent to Passport India Investment (Mauritius) and 2 per cent to GLG Financials Fund. 

 The transactions put the enterprise value of MCX at over $1.1 billion (Rs 4,400 crore).

 Financial Technologies will get about Rs 720 crore from selling its stake to the four entities, an exchange official said. With the sale, the companys shareholding in MCX will come down to 49 per cent, he added.

 The government is yet to prepare guidelines on foreign equity in commodity exchanges, but Financial Technologies has gone ahead with the divestment.

 Commodity market regulator Forward Markets Commission (FMC) had asked exchanges to maintain status quo, pending the guidelines.

 However, MCX officials said necessary approvals had been taken from the FMC and other authorities. FMC chairman B.C. Khatua said the approval was conditional. 

 We have approved the stake sale on the condition that they have to conform to the guidelines when they come, he said. He said the guidelines were expected to be similar to the ones brought out by Sebi for stock markets. 

 HDFC Bank, the SBI and its associate banks, Canara Bank, the Bank of India, the Union Bank and the Bank of Baroda together hold around 27 per cent in MCX.

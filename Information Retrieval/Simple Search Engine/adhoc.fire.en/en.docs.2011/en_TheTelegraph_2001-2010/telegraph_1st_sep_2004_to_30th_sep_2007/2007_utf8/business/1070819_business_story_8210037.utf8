 Uttar Pradesh spikes Anils SEZ proposal

 Ambani: Hard times

 Lucknow, Aug. 18 (PTI): In a setback to the Anil Ambani group, the Uttar Pradesh government today rejected its proposed special economic zone (SEZ) in Noida on the ground that it did not conform to the Centres guidelines.

 The decision was taken at a state cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Mayawati here, principal secretary Shailesh Krishna said.

 Apart from the land already acquired, an additional 2,000-acre will be needed for the SEZ. Krishna said this was not possible without forced acquisition.

 The Anil Ambani group had proposed to set up a multi-product SEZ spread over 2,500 acres in Noida. The proposal was cleared by the previous Mulayam Singh government. The new regime led by Mayawati had raised objections as soon as it came to power early this year.

 Krishna said the state government took the decision on the basis of the report submitted by a committee, headed by the industrial development commissioner, set up to review the Uttar Pradesh SEZ Policy of 2006, he said.

 The state government would inform the Centre that the proposed SEZ did not conform to the new government guidelines for setting up such zones, Krishna said.

 He said the guidelines prohibited forced acquisition. Besides, some landowners had objected to the acquisition, he added.

 Krishna, however, said the company could submit a fresh proposal in accordance with the new guidelines.

 The Mayawati government, soon after it came to power, had written to the Centre pointing out flaws in the previous Samajwadi Party regimes approval to the project on the ground that it violated the SEZ policy. The Anil Ambani group had earlier contended that the SEZ met all the norms.

 Krishna said the new state policy on special economic zones had been amended, incorporating procedures laid down by the Centre.

 The principle of first-come-first-serve for selecting promoters was not found to be competitive and transparent and as such was liable to be scrapped, he said, quoting the report of the committee. 

 Instead, the principle of private-public participation should be followed, the report suggested.

 The committee also recommended changes in the use of land for various purposes under the economic zone.

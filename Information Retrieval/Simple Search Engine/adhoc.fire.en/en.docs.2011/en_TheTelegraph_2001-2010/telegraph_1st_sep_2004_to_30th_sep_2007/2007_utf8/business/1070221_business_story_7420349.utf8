The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Net profit at Rs 511 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 20: A combination of cost efficiencies, higher volumes and price increases today saw Hindustan Lever Ltd (HLL) posting a net profit of Rs 511 crore, which beat Street expectation, but was 1.9 per cent lower than the Rs 520.86 crore it recorded in the year-ago period.

 Analysts had estimated HLL to post a net profit of over Rs 490 crore.

 The drop in profit was due to exceptional income in the corresponding period last year relating to profit on disposal of the plantation business and sale of an investment. 

 While exceptional items had then accounted for Rs 82.36 crore, it stood lower at Rs 27.35 crore during the three-month period ended December 2006. 

 This included profit arising from the disposal of a 51 per cent share in subsidiary and restructuring costs in the foods business.

 Despite the drop in its bottomline (post exceptional items), the FMCG giant had some good news in its core operations. This led to the company posting a double-digit growth in net profit (prior to exceptional items) for the second consecutive year. Net profit jumped to Rs 483.43 crore, a 10.24 per cent growth.

 Outlining the factors that contributed to this performance, HLL finance director D. Sundaram said the FMCG business grew by 8.5 per cent. 

 While home and personal care business (HPC) grew at 8 per cent, led by double-digit growth in laundry and toothpaste, the foods business grew by 10.9 per cent. Strong performances by the Kissan portfolio and the Knorr range drove the processed foods category even as the ice-cream business came up with a stellar performance due to wider availability. However, certain factors dragged down what could have been a robust growth in its topline.

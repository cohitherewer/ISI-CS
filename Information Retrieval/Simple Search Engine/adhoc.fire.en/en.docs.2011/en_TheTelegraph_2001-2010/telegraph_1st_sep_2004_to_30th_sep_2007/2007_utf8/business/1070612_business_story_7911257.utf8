 India, Russia plan trade pact

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 11: India and Russia will work on an economic co-operation agreement to increase bilateral trade by slashing customs tariffs and stepping up mutual investments.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath and Russian trade minister German Gref on Saturday decided to set up a joint task force to explore the scope of the proposed deal.

 The task force will also monitor the implementation of the programme recommended by the Indo-Russian joint study group to increase two-way trade to $10 billion by 2010, a commerce ministry statement said today.

 The joint study group is in the process of finalising a report that will analyse the bilateral trade situation and recommend ways to increase economic co-operation between the two countries. 

 Nath also requested the Russian trade minister to protect Darjeeling tea as a geographical indication and recognise Assam, Nilgiri and the Indian tea logo as well known original brands. 

 He has requested Gref to help set up joint ventures between Indian tea companies and Russian business houses to increase the export of quality tea from India. 

 Diamond deal

 Cooperation in diamond trade between Russia and India also figured in the discussions. 

 India is the largest processing centre for rough diamonds and Russia is a leading producer of such diamonds in the world and, therefore, cooperation in this sector through direct trade will benefit both countries.

 Tobacco treaty

 Nath also wants a draft agreement with Russia on the import of Indian tobacco to be finalised soon. 

 Nath wants Russia to import more tobacco from India or buy cigarettes from a joint venture proposed to be set up in Russia by an Indian company, which will procure tobacco from India.

 Bilateral trade between the two countries increased at the rate of 11 per cent in 2004-05. However, Indias exports to Russia have been declining over the past few years. 

 Indo-Russian bilateral trade in 2004-05 was $1.8 billion. Of this, exports to Russia amounted to $597.43 million and imports from Russia were worth $1,265.38 million.

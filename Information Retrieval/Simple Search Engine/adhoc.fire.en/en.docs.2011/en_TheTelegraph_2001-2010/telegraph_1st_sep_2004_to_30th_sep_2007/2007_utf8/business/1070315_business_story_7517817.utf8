 New Delhi, March 14: ITC Limited will invest around Rs 350 crore through its foods division over the next three to four years to include snacks in its portfolio.

 For this, the company will set up three manufacturing facilities across the country.

 We have already invested Rs 60-70 crore to make a foray into the snacks segment. In a couple of years, we will invest Rs 150 crore in this segment, said Ravi Naware, chief executive, ITC foods division.

 While the company already has a snacks plant in Hardwar, Naware said one more plant would be set up within a year to cater to the snacks segment. 

 Besides, in the next three to four years, we are considering setting up two more plants to be present in all the regions of the country, he said without divulging location details.

 It is estimated that each additional plant could cost ITC anywhere between Rs 70 crore and Rs 100 crore.

 The company is eyeing 25 per cent market share of the Rs 2,000-crore organised market in the next four to five years. According to estimates made by ITC, the branded snacks segment is growing at 30 per cent per annum. However, the category is dominated by a number of unbranded regional firms.

 The entry in the snacks segment will help the company widen its portfolio of consumer goods and foods.

 This is a fast growing category with a huge untapped potential. Our retail distribution strength and our understanding of consumers will help us redefine the category, said Naware.

 The company today launched its snacks brand Bingo in 16 flavours. It will initially sell varieties of potato chips and finger snacks priced between Rs 5 and Rs 10.

 Tatas to beef up IT hub

 Calcutta, April 6: Tatas bonhomie with Bengal is growing by the day.

 The group has now set its sights on a civic infrastructure project. A special purpose vehicle (SPV) formed by two Tata companies Tata Steel and Voltas will take up water distribution and sewerage projects in the tech hub of Sector V.

 Nabadiganta, the municipality that manages Sector V, is set to sign a pact with the SPV by the end of this month.

 Tata Steel is participating in the project through its wholly owned subsidiary, Jamshedpur Utilities and Services Company Ltd (Jusco).

 Sanjiv Paul, managing director of Jusco the company that runs utility services in Jamshedpur told The Telegraph the SPV would build a distribution network to supply water round the clock to all consumers, comprising mostly IT companies. It would also set up a sewerage network and treatment plant.

 A combo project of water distribution and sewerage has never been done on a built-operate-transfer (BOT) basis in India, Paul said.

 The project was conceptualised by Calcutta Municipal Development Authority (CMDA) on behalf of Nabadiganta. CMDA and the SPV are now discussing user charges.

 P.A. Baviskar, CEO of CMDA, assured that the charges would be in line with that in other cities. The principal secretary of the urban development department has sought some clarification which we have provided, Baviskar said. The secretary is expected to award the contract soon.

 Jusco will be given two acres to build the necessary infrastructure. The company will also get water at a concessional rate. It would have to treat the water likely to be 3 million gallons per day and distribute it.

 Jusco will also set up infrastructure for liquid waste management and discharge the treated water in the canal.

 The BOT contract would be effective for 30 years, following which the assets created by Jusco will go to the civic authorities.

 We have been given a preliminary idea about the project. It was indicated that the costs, though higher than charged currently, would be lower than similar places in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai, G.S. Radhakrishnan, MD of Descon, said.

 Kalyan Kar, managing director of Acclaris India is also upbeat on the project.

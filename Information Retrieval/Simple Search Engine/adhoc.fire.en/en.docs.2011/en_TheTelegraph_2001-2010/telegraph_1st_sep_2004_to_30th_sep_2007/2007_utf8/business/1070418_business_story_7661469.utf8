 UTI Bank net profit surges 40%

 OUR BUREAU

April 17: UTI Bank Ltd has reported a 39.65 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 211.89 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31 compared with Rs 151.73 crore in the year-ago period. The rise in profit was mainly because of a strong performance by its core banking operations.

 Net profit for the financial year was Rs 659.03 crore, a rise of 35.86 per cent over Rs 485.08 crore recorded in 2005-06. 

 UTI Bank said during the fourth quarter, the net interest income, which represents its core banking operations, was Rs 464.23 crore compared with Rs 312.86 crore in the same period a year ago, registering a growth of 48.38 per cent. 

 The net interest margin for the quarter was up 3.06 per cent compared with 2.96 cent a year ago. While net advances grew 65 per cent, the banks balance sheet size rose to Rs 73,257.22 crore on March 31, 2007 from Rs 49,731.12 crore a year ago. 

 The fee income for the fourth quarter was Rs 257.94 crore compared with Rs 162.38 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

 The banks total deposits grew to Rs 58,785.60 crore on March 31, 2007. According to the bank, a strong growth in advances and investments, together with higher share demand deposits, contributed to the rise in net interest income. 

 HCL Tech

 HCL Technologies has reported a 72 per cent increase in net income at Rs 331.8 crore in the quarter ended March 31.

 The companys revenues jumped 40.6 per cent to Rs 1,577 crore in the January-March quarter.

 The rise in rupee is a matter of concern but the rupee appreciation has not affected the growth of the company much, HCL Tech president Vineet Nayar said.

 However, for a 1 per cent impact on dollar, EBIDTA (gross profits) of the company will decrease by 35 basis points, he added. He said the companys focus will be to fine-tune markets, so that rupee appreciation does not affect margins.

 We have reserves of $900 million, which helped the company recover from the dollar impact, Nayar said.

 On the recent reports about HCL Technologies acquiring Cambridge Solutions, he said, We do not need acquisitions to grow but to create value. For the past two quarters, we are pursuing this but are nowhere close to any deal right now.

 The companys headcount stood at 40,149 on March 31, with additions of 1,832 employees this quarter.

 Europe and Australia-New Zealand have shown accelerated growth at 69.2 per cent and 83.2 per cent respectively.

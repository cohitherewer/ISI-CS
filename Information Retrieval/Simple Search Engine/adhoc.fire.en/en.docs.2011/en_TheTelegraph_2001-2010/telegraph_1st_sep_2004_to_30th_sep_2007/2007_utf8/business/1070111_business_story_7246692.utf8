 Anil gets a free hand

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 10: Anil Ambani isnt going to be cowed by Vodafones firepower. The board of directors of Reliance Communications (R-Com), his mobile telephony venture, today permitted him to build a war chest and mount his bid for Hutchison Essar Ltd.

 The R-Com board approved a $1-billion foreign currency convertible bond (FCCB) issue and authorised Ambani to raise resources through other means such as external commercial borrowings (ECBs).

 It is believed that R-Com may soon announce plans to raise up to $2 billion through other instruments that include an ECB and a global depository receipts (GDR) issue. 

 Reliance Communications is also expected to start the process of conducting a due diligence exercise at Hutch Essar in a day or two. Last month, Anil Ambani had formally acknowledged his interest in Hutch Essar. The R-Com board today reaffirmed that interest. 

 In a notice sent to stock exchanges, Reliance Communications said the board reaffirmed its interest in the potential opportunity relating to the business of HEL.

 While authorising the R-Com chairman to take all necessary steps in pursuit of the bid, including raising long-term resources in the form of ECB and others, the board noted that there was no certainty either on the completion, or the timing of the said proposal.

 The FCCBs will be floated on international markets, in one or more tranches, at a premium to the market price of the equity shares of the company.

 Although Reliance Communications has not stated the objectives behind the FCCB issue, funds raised from it are expected to be used for the proposed acquisition.

 An official from the company, however, refused to comment on whether the company was considering another overseas issue. 

 Reliance Communications is now ranked among Asias top six most valuable telecom companies. It also announced a record 1.4 million net subscriber additions on its wireless network, the highest growth seen across all telecom operators during December 2006.

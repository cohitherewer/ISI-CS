 Murthy on Unilever board

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Murthy: Standing tall

Mumbai, Feb. 8: N.R. Narayana Murthy, chairman and chief mentor of Infosys, will shortly enter the boardroom of FMCG giant Unilever.

 Murthy will be inducted as a non-executive director after shareholders of the Anglo-Dutch group approved his appointment at an annual general meeting in Rotterdam on May 15 and in London on May 16.

 Unilever today proposed changes in its board that will see three new non-executive directors being inducted. Apart from Murthy, Genevieve Berger, a professor of Biophysics and Medical Imaging at Paris University, Hixonia Nyasulu, who is a board member of JP Morgan South Africa, will also be inducted.

 Lord Simon, chairman of the nomination committee, Unilever, said, Unilever is delighted with these outstanding candidates as they further strengthen the expertise and independence of the board and, of course, bring diversity of background and experience.

 A Reuters report says that Unilever 

 reported underlying sales that was below analyst expectations 

 even as it gave a lacklustre outlook for 2007. It recorded 

 fourth-quarter underlying sales growth of just 3.4 per cent. 

 Sales for the whole year only rose 3.8 per cent.

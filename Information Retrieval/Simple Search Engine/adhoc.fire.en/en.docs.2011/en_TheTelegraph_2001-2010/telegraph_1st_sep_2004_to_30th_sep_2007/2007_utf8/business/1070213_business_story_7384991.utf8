 Essar set to foray into Vietnam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 12: Essar Steel Vietnam Holdings Pvt Ltd, Singapore, an Essar group company, today joined hands with Vietnam Steel Corporation and Vietnam General Rubber Corporation to form a joint venture called Essar Vietnam Steel Corporation.

 The joint venture will set up a hot strip plant with an initial capacity of 2 million tonnes per annum of hot-rolled coils and sheets. 

 The project is likely to cost $527 million and is expected to be completed in 30 months. 

 Essar Steel Vietnam Holdings will hold a 65 per cent stake while Vietnam Steel will hold 20 per cent and Vietnam General Rubber will hold the balance 15 per cent in the joint venture.

 The plant will come up in Phu My Industrial Zone, Baria Vung Tau province, in southern Vietnam. This province is well connected by road and close to the proposed port.

 On its foray into Vietnam, Essar said the country currently uses 6 million tonnes of steel of which hot-rolled coils account for 2 million tonnes. 

 The steel consumption is expected to go up to 10 million tonnes by 2012. In the absence of a flat steel plant, Vietnam imports its entire requirement of hot-rolled coils. This project is, therefore, expected to substitute the imports.

 Vietnam Steel Corporation is a wholly owned unit of the government of Vietnam and it has steel plants both in north and south of Vietnam. 

 The two recent plants commissioned by Vietnam Steel Corporation are a 0.4 million-tonnes-per-year cold rolling plant and a 0.5-million-tonnes-per-year mini mill both located in Phu My Industrial Zone, Baria Vung Tau province in southern Vietnam. 

 Vietnam General Rubber, the largest rubber company in that country, supplies natural rubber and latex.

 Essar Steel Vietnam Holdings is a subsidiary of Essar Steel Holdings Ltd. 

 Essar Steel Holdings is part of Essar Global, the group holding company with interests in steel, energy, power, communications, shipping amp; logistics and projects. Essar Global has an asset base of $6 billion.

 Essar produces around 4.6 million tonnes of steel. It is also present in Indonesia where 0.4 million tonnes of cold-rolled products are manufactured.

 Shareholders nod 

 Essar Steel will seek shareholders approval to delist its equity shares from the bourses through a postal ballot.

 The board of directors at its meeting on January 29, has appointed chartered accountant T.N.V. Visweswara Rao as the scrutiniser to conduct the postal ballot process in a fair and transparent manner, Essar Steel has informed the BSE.

 The scrutiniser would submit his report to the chairman or director of the company and the results would be announced on March 21.

 On February 8, another group firm, Essar Oil Ltd, said it would seek shareholders approval to delist the equity shares of the company through postal ballot.

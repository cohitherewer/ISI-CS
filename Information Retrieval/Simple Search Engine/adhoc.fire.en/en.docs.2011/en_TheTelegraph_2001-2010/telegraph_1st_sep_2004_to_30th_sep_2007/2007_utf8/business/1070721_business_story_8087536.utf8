 Calcutta, July 20: Exide 

 Industries Limited is looking at a hike in battery prices 

 as lead costs have shot up by 30 per cent between April 

 1 and July 19.

 Lead prices hovered around $3,314.50 per tonne on the London Metal Exchange. Last quarter, Exide had raised battery prices twice.

 To counter escalating lead costs, automotive and industrial battery makers are likely to hike prices by anywhere between 7.5 and 10 per cent across segments, sources said.

 We will take a call on the possibility of a price hike in our battery range between July and September. We are closely monitoring the lead price curve and our decision would depend on it. It is a call we have to take between our market share and rising input costs, said T.V. Ramanathan, managing director and CEO of Exide.

 Exide has its contracts linked to lead prices on the London Metal Exchange. Product prices, therefore, depend on the lead price graph.

 The stored energy solutions major has also received board approval to pick up a 25 per cent stake in Australia-based Ceil Motive Power Pty Ltd.

 The company would buy it from the two entrepreneurs who own this Australian distribution, marketing, sales and services company with an investment of not less than Aus$1 million. This could even go up to Aus$4 million.

 Ceil Motive Power will be valued post reconciliation of its June 2007 accounts. The company distributed Exide traction batteries in the Australian market.

 After acquiring this stake, Exide is likely to become the largest player in traction batteries in Australia. It is currently the third largest player there.

 Traction batteries are used for electric forklifts, battery operated trucks and similar vehicles.

 The Australian market for such batteries is five times that of its Indian counterpart.

 Exide has developed a technologically superior version of traction battery for imported battery-operated trucks for transnational companies such as Komatsuk Yale, Still, Linde, Crown and Jungherinrich.

 Its exports are set to grow from 400,000 cells a year to one million in the next two years. Its annual exports of 100,000 cells to Australia are set to double within a year.

 The battery major is also exploring options to enter knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) in power electronics. It has increased its stake in Caldyne Automatics Ltd, which would provide the platform for this purpose, to 100 per cent from 51 per cent.

 Through Caldyne, Exide will manufacture high-end chargers and solar energy products.

 The capital expenditure has been increased from Rs 140 to Rs 185 crore.

 This would be used to expand capacity. Automotive batteries for four-wheelers will be increased from 5.6 million units to 7 million and those for two-wheelers from 7 million units to 10 million annually.

 For the quarter ended June 30, the companys profit after tax jumped 84 per cent to Rs 70.1 crore from Rs 38.1 crore in the year-ago period.

 This was primarily because of foreign exchange gains of Rs 8 to 9 crore resulting from a rising rupee.

 DoT to step up spectrum demand

 New Delhi, June 11 (PTI): The first group of ministers meeting on spectrum on June 13 will discuss the DoTs demand for immediate release of 42.5mhz of radio waves. The defence forces will also put their case in getting a secured and reliable network before vacating any spectrum.

 The department of telecommunications (DoT) is readying proposals to press for additional spectrum apart from the 42.5mhz for immediate release. Defence forces, however, have been non-committal even on the release of the 42.5mhz of spectrum in the near future.

 The current users of the spectrum are defence, railways and police.

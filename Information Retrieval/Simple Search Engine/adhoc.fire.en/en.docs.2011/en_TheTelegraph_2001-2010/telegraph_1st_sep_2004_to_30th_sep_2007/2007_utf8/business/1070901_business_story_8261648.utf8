 Panel to revive sick tea gardens

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: The government has set up a high-powered committee to revive closed tea gardens in Bengal, Assam and Kerala. 

 The plan is to first take over these gardens and then look for new private investors to run them. There are 24 such tea estates that are lying closed. 

 While the additional secretary in the commerce ministry is heading the committee, Tea Board chairman and finance secretaries of Bengal, Assam and Kerala are the other members.

 The panel will look into proposals by workers co-operatives as well as other tea garden owners to manage these sick gardens.

 We will give preference to co-operative societies if they come up with viable revival packages. However, private entrepreneurs with good track record will not be given short shrift either, officials said. 

 The commerce ministry has already issued notices to owners of sick gardens under Section 16(E) of the Tea Act, 1953. This section, which has not been used since the 1950s, states a garden that is closed for more than three months can be taken over by the government without investigation.

 Officials said the government was forced to take this extreme step as the current owners had proved themselves incapable of coming up with viable packages. They still have a chance to come up with a revival scheme or come up with new owners if they want to make money out of their closed gardens ... otherwise we will take over, officials said.

 The tough official stand comes on the back of media reports of starvation deaths among workers of closed tea estates and strong reactions from labour unions.

 Earlier this year, the Centre had come up with a scheme to bail out the sick tea gardens. The package included a five-year moratorium on bank loans, waiver of penal interest and EPF penalties and fresh loans at a subsidised interest rate.

 The scheme, however, fell flat as garden owners did not take advantage of it to reopen the tea estates. Officials fear that most owners are more interested in the real estate value of the tea gardens than in actually running them.

 Most of the gardens were shut down after productivity of ageing tea bushes fell and profits plummeted.

 $10bn bilateral trade in 4 years

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 25: India and Russia today sought to increase bilateral trade to $10 billion by 2010 by exploring opportunities in non-conventional energy and oil. 

 I wish bilateral trade of $10 billion by 2010it would just be the minimum threshold, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting of industry chambers.

 Bilateral trade with Russia is now estimated at around $3.8 billion. It was $2.5 billion in 2005-06.

 To achieve the target of $10 billion, trade between the two countries must grow at 30 per cent instead of the current 20 per cent, said Putin.

 The Russian President, however, admitted that efforts to increase the volume of trade were deterred by high transportation cost, which could be resolved through discussions.

 The chambers also expressed concern over the trade route. Putin said the Russian government was studying the possibility of increasing capacities at its existing ports.

 On allowing direct imports of Russian diamonds, Putin said earlier this month his government passed a legislation permitting Al-Rosa, the Russian mining consortium, to export rough diamonds to other parties besides De Beers.

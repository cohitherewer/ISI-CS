 New Delhi, March 20: US-based Dell Inc plans to set up a computer hardware factory at Sriperumbudur in Chennai. Dell Inc chief executive officer Michael Dell said the plant was likely to have a capacity of 4 lakh units a year and would start commercial production by July.

 Dell Inc has lined up investments worth $30 million over five years for this project. The US-based companys chief executive officer also met communications minister Dayanidhi Maran, and, according to sources, promised to turn the plant into a hub for Dell operations.

 We can scale up investment (in India) consistent with opportunities, Dell said. He added that both India and China are growing markets and more investments are due in this region. 

 We are going where the talent and market are, the chief executive officer said. He, however, complained about the high tariff rates in India. According to him, 25 per cent of the cost of production is incurred because of sales tax and customs duty.

 Dell Inc already has call centre operations, research and development activities, and computer and server sales business in India. 

 Our operations continue to grow and we are adding more people, Dell said. In the commercial space in India, Dell Inc claims to have the largest user base. 

 The chief executive officer feels a large number of computer users can be added to the current 50 million in India. 

 Dell said last year, his firms sales had gone up by 70 per cent and laptop sales in India have gone up by 113 per cent. India will soon become a billion-dollar market for Dell Inc. The company sells products worth half-a-billion dollars in the country. 

 The firm will also consider more acquisitions globally. These can be in services or hardware production. He also said the company was trying to cut down on the power consumed by its computers. 

 Officials said an optiplex desktop computer, which Dell has designed, will consume 70 per cent less power.

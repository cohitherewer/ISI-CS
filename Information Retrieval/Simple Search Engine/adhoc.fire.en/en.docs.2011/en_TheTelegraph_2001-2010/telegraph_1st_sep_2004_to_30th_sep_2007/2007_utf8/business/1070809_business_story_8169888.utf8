 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Pillai: Green signal

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: The government today gave Mukesh Ambanis Navi Mumbai SEZ a years extension to complete land acquisition and cleared Enfield Infrastructures infotech zone in Bengals South 24 Parganas.

 The in-principle approval for the Navi Mumbai SEZ was extended with a crucial rider the developers would have to reduce the size of the project to 5,000 hectares. 

 The commerce ministry has also asked RIL to ensure that land acquisition is done with the consent of owners. Acquisition through the state government will not be allowed. 

 The board of approval cleared six fresh SEZ proposals today, including Infosyss two special economic zones near Hyderabad. Of the six proposals cleared, two were given in-principle approvals, while four received formal clearances. 

 Along with Enfield, Genpact received an approval for an IT zone in Jaipur.

 The board also gave in-principle approvals to two SEZs in Maharashtra a multi-product SEZ by Ispat Industries and a biotech zone by Veritas Infrastructure Development.

 The government has so far given 366 formal approvals and 178 in-principle clearances. Another nine proposals will be taken up at the boards next meeting on August 30. 

 On RILs Navi Mumbai SEZ, commerce secretary G.K. Pillai said, The issue was not required to be brought to the board and was processed by the commerce ministry. 

 He, however, made it clear that RIL would have to bring down the size of the project to 5,000 hectares under the new rules that limit the size of an SEZ to 5,000 hectares. The developers of Navi Mumbai had earlier proposed to build the zone in over 10,000 hectares and received an in-principle approval in August last year. 

 However, earlier this year, the empowered group of ministers on SEZs decided to limit the area for all SEZs to 5,000 hectares. Pillai added that the rule enforcing a limit of 5,000 hectares would be applicable to all SEZ proposals.

 The amendment to the rules had also reduced the validity of in-principle approvals to one year from three years earlier. However, the board was given the power to extend the validity by two more years.

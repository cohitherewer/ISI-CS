 LIC to enter credit card business

 Mumbai, July 11 (PTI): The Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) today scotched speculation of setting up or acquiring a bank but said it planned to enter the credit cards business and manage pension funds.

 We have no intention of owning a bank as it is a highly specialised area, LIC chairman T.S. Vijayan said. The assertion came amid reports of the countrys largest life insurer trying to acquire a major stake in UTI Bank.

 The LIC, however, has strategic partnership with Corporation Bank, owning a 27 per cent stake in it. It has a substantial shareholding in a number of other banks, but does not have a controlling stake.

 Vijayan said the LIC would foray into health insurance, pension management and credit cards business.

 The corporation is in talks with GE Capital Services, the largest global issuer of private label credit cards. There is a possibility of Corporation Bank joining the business.

 GE already has a tieup with the State Bank of India for the credit card business. The LIC wants to enter the business to tap the huge potential in the segment.

 Vijayan said the LIC had created a separate department for health insurance in its corporate set-up and the department was making efforts to come out with innovative products. We would be coming out with our initiative during the latter part of the year. We are building a strong marketing network and technology platform for the new health insurance product.

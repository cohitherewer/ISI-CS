 New Delhi, Sept. 18: After emails and videos, its time to watch television on the mobile phone. 

 The telecom regulator has initiated a consultation process to seek operators views before issuing guidelines for mobile TV services.

 The government will also issue a regulatory framework for mobile TV. 

 A joint group comprising officials from telecom and information and broadcasting ministries has been constituted to draft the framework.

 The group will submit its report soon, said officials.

 Based on comments from the industry, Trai will issue recommendations on issues relating to mobile television services. The guidelines will be on international practice, eligibility criteria, net worth requirement, foreign direct and indirect investment levels, technology, revenue sharing, entry fees, bank guarantee, spectrum and facilities to be offered by service providers.

 A joint group of ministers will study the recommendations before releasing the final set of regulations. 

 The group will also examine the issue of content. For mobile television, only the channels approved by the ministry can be allowed, said officials.

 The group will study the law under which new broadcast modes can be regulated. 

 The current broadcasting law does not cover mobile television because the mode of transmission is not traditional, that is, satellite or terrestrial, said officials.

 Cable operators and broadcasters want security, licensing and downlinking laws for TV channels to be extended to programmes on mobile phones.

 If the new broadcast modes are considered cable services, the definition of broadcasting service and cable operators will need to change, an official said. 

 Security and content are not the only issues, officials said. As mobile TV is in the telecom domain, it will be eligible for 74 per cent foreign direct investment compared with 49 per cent for entertainment channels and just 26 per cent for news channels. 

 India has the potential for mobile TV services as the subscription base is growing at a phenomenal rate with more than 7 million customers signing up for mobile services each month, said Sanjay Sinha, CEO of AirChord TeleVentures. The Delhi-based company is venturing into the wireless TV segment.

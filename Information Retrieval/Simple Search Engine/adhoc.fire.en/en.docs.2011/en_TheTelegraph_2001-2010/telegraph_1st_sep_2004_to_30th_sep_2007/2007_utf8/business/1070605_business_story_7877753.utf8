 India blocks wine duty probe

 Geneva, June 4 (AP): India blocked a World Trade Organization investigation of its import duties on American wine and spirits today. This will temporarily delay a US government complaint over allegations that Indian rules discriminate against products such as Napa Valley Wine and Jack Daniels whisky.

 The Geneva-based trade referee is already reviewing a European legal challenge of wine and liquor restrictions in a number of Indian states. A second investigative panel examining Washingtons arguments will also certainly be established at a meeting of the WTOs dispute settlement body later this month.

 The customs duties in India, in particular on wine and distilled spirits, are not in line with its WTO commitments, US trade representative Susan Schwab had said last month while announcing plans to seek litigation. 

 US proposal

 The US today submitted a proposal at the WTO for prohibiting certain trade-distorting industrial subsidies, a move that could impact the interests of developing countries.

 It is time to take the next step towards stronger WTO rules that will rein in the use of industrial subsidies. Foreign government subsidies provide an unfair competitive advantage, US trade representative Susan Schwab said.

 The US has proposed to stop five types of subsidies if they were specific, that is only given to a particular company or industry, and benefit a product that is exported or competes with imports.

 Bharat Earth steps into contract mining 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 24: Bharat Earth Movers is venturing into contract mining business. It is negotiating with steel and power companies that have captive blocks. 

 Last month, Bharat Earth set up a joint venture with Hyderabad-based Midwest Granite and Indonesias Sumber Mitra Jaya for contract mining. The joint venture, BEML Midwest, has an authorised capital of Rs 100 crore. Bharat Earth has a 45 per cent stake in the company. 

 The company will do contract mining till the government opens up the sector. 

 M. Poongavanam, director (mining and construction), Bharat Earth, said the company was in talks with NTPC to mine its coal blocks. It expects a revenue of Rs 500 crore from the business in the next few years.

 He said the joint venture was also looking for contracts in Indonesia and Australia. Right now we are negotiating a Rs 50-crore deal in Australia. 

 The company is also planning a warehousing facility in Malaysia by September. We may convert this facility into an equipment assembling plant depending on the volume of orders and mining contracts that we may get, Poongavanam said.

 Bharat Earth chairman-cum-managing director V.R.S. Natarajan said the firm was betting big on coal mining.

 There is a huge potential in coal since half of the power generated in the country use the mineral as fuel. The demand for electricity is expected to jump because of the high growth rates seen in the coming years and the governments mission of Power for All by 2012.

 In its blueprint to meet the demand-supply mismatch in coal by 2025, the government has forecast an additional investment of Rs 95,000 crore in opencast mining and Rs 23,000 crore in underground mining.

 Govt upbeat on meeting export target

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Pillai: Confident

 New Delhi, Aug. 28: The government is optimistic about meeting the export target of $160 billion for the current fiscal.

 This will be possible as the rupee, which has been rising against the dollar since August last year, is beginning to weaken. We are confident of meeting the export target set for 2007-08, if the rupee remains at 40-41 to the dollar. There is no need to revise the export target, commerce secretary G.K. Pillai said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 He said the commerce ministry was holding a series of meetings with various export promotion councils to work out ways to increase exports. The government had set an export target of $160 billion for 2007-08 against exports worth $125 billion in the last fiscal.

 Officials earlier said there were possibilities of the target being revised to about $140 billion, with the rupee appreciating against the dollar by about 11 per cent since August last year.

 However, in July, exports grew almost 16 per cent in dollar terms over the same period of the previous year, while in rupee terms, the growth was about 6 per cent, said Pillai.

 Keeping the current growth rate in mind, the commerce ministry is also looking at exports of $300 billion by 2012-13 and imports of $400 billion on the back of increased emphasis on manufacturing.

 We are preparing a blueprint and looking at exports of $300 billion by 2013, given the growth in the manufacturing sector, he said.

 On the free trade agreement (FTA) between India and Asean, Pillai said it was likely to be signed at the Asean summit in November this year.

 Efforts are on to tie up all modalities on the FTA by September 30, he said.

 An announcement on the FTA is expected to be made by the Prime Ministers at the Asean Summit to be held in Singapore in November, said Pillai who was in Manila last week to discuss agreement details with the 10-nation bloc.

 We had a good meeting with members of the Asean and there was positive movement from both sides, he added.

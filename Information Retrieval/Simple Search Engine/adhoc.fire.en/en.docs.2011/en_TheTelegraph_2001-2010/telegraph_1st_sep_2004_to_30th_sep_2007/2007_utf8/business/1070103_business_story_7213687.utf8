 Bank duo hikes PLR 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 2: Bank of India (BoI) and Bank of Baroda (BoB) today hiked their benchmark lending rates by 50 basis points each. Most banks have raised their lending rates after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) hiked the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 50 basis points last month.

 Both the banks raised their prime lending rates (PLR) to 12 per cent from 11.50 per cent. While BoB revised rate is effective from January 1, BoIs will come into force from today. 

 The banks were, however, silent on whether home loan rates would also go up as a consequence of the PLR hike.

 BoI said though PLR was raised by half a percentage point, it would limit the impact on agricultural and small and medium enterprises (SME) to not more than 25 basis points, thereby hinting that interest charged to highly rated companies have been raised.

 It said in respect of agricultural advances, crop loans up to Rs 3 lakh would continue to be charged interest at 7 per cent. These will not be affected by the PLR hike. In keeping with the wishes of Union finance minister P. Chidambaram, BoI is now focussing on micro finance.

 UBI move

 United Bank of India (UBI) and Allahabad Bank today revised the PLR to 12 per cent as the banking system is left with less cash following increase in CRR by the Reserve Bank by 0.25 per cent from December 23. Allahabad Bank hiked PLR to 12 per cent from 11.5 per cent, while UBI raised it to 12 per cent from 11.75 per cent. Allahabad Bank, in a statement, said this was in order to keep the banks net margin intact to garner resources. UBI has also revised fixed deposit rates by 25 to 75 basis points.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Deal street buzzing with activity

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Aug. 6: India Inc sealed around 550 deals worth $55 billion in the first half of this year. It will maintain this trend with cross-border takeovers claiming a larger share of the pie, according to a report by global consultancy firm PwC.

 Merger and acquisitions (M amp;A) activity is expected to remain on an uptrend in the second half of 2007 and the dominance of cross-border deals is expected to continue, said PwC in its report on M amp;A update for the first half of 2007.

 The period was marked by heightened activity in overseas acquisitions and a significant growth in private investments in the country.

 Two major deals Tata Steels $13.6-billion acquisition of Anglo-Dutch firm Corus and Hindalcos $6-billion buyout of Novelis brought India to the global forefront.

 PwC said foreign direct investment was likely to get a boost with a consistent economic growth, reform measures and infrastructure development. However, any significant policy change seems unlikely. The FDI cap could be relaxed in sectors such as petroleum refining and civil aviation, the report stated.

 Indias M amp;A performance during the period was globally second to Australia.

 The report also highlighted that the myth that Indian companies are all about IT and outsourcing was finally broken as most of the deals came from non-IT segments.

 Sectors such as energy, oil and gas, steel, cement, aluminum and other metals accounted for over 50 per cent of the deal value compared with just 20-25 per cent a couple of years back. 

 This shows that companies in such sectors are looking to be globally competitive and are not following a protectionist policy.

 The country has also won the confidence of domestic and overseas banking community as many deals were funded through debt.

 On private equity and venture capital funding, PwC said it expected such investments to rise further and exceed $10 billion in 2007.

 Other overseas deals during this period include Tata Powers acquisition of a 30 per cent stake in two Indonesian coal firms for $1.1 billion and Essar Steels buyout of Canadas Algoma Steel Inc for $1.58 billion. Vijay Mallya-led United Spirits purchase of Scotlands Whyte amp; Mackay for $1.17 billion and Suzlons acquisition of a 74.6 per cent stake in German REpower Systems AG for $1 billion were also among the list.

 Domestic investments also scaled new peaks, the most significant being Vodafones acquisition of a 52 per cent stake in Hutchison Essar for $10.9 billion. 

 Other important deals include Vedantas acquisition of a 51 per cent stake in Sesa Goa for $ 981 million.

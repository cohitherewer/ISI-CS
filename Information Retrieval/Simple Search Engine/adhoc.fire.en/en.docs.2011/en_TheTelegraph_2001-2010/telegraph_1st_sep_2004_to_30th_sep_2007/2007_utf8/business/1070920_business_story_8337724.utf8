 GoAir IPO to take off in 2009

 Jeh Wadia: Reaching out

 Calcutta, Sept. 19: GoAir, the Wadia groups low-cost carrier, plans to come up with its initial public offering in 2009. 

 Company managing director Jeh Wadia today said the airline would start making profits from 2008-09.

 We have suffered little loss compared with other low-cost airlines in the country. By the middle of the next financial year, we will be able to report profits. We may tap the capital markets in 2009 after we start making profits, Wadia said on the sidelines of the annual general meeting of Britannia Industries.

 However, there is another reason to delay the offering till 2009. 

 The domestic aviation sector is beset with infrastructure bottlenecks. But by 2009 we are going to have 11 new airports coming up, according to the government plan. By then, tax and other policy reforms will also have made much headway. It thus makes sense to tap the capital markets in 2009-2010, Wadia said. 

 The company is planning to consolidate its operations in domestic air travel. 

 GoAir will increase its daily flights to 90 from October 26 from 60 now. 

 The airline will also acquire 20 aircraft for $1.2 billion. 

 Some of the Airbus planes will be delivered by the end of this month. 

 From the middle of next year, we will start our operations in Calcutta, Wadia added. GoAir has flights to all other parts of the country except the east and the Northeast. 

 According to Wadia, growth in the domestic aviation industry has been hit by inadequate infrastructure and poor policies. 

 Acquisitions in the low-cost carrier segment is not profitable. We want to grow slowly and not become aggressive, Wadia added.

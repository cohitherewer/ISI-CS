 Policy for infotech townships in the offing

 New Delhi, June 17 (PTI): The government is preparing a policy to set up integrated townships for IT and BPO sectors that will offer tax sops to developers similar to those enjoyed by promoters of SEZs.

 The department of information technology is framing a policy for such IT investment regions. 

 It has already started discussions with the finance ministry on the benefits that can be given to develop and operate the infrastructure facilities, sources said.

 The finance ministry has agreed to give full tax exemption on profits for 10 years to providers of these facilities. But unlike SEZs, no tax exemptions will be given to co-developers, the sources said.

 The finance ministry has also said that apart from the concessions already available under the income tax act for infrastructure development, there is no case for providing additional tax sops.

 Even in the case of petroleum, chemical and petrochemical investment regions, the government has only exempted developers and infrastructure providers from income tax. This means that units in the proposed IT investment regions will pay taxes just like their counterparts elsewhere.

 Besides development, operations and maintenance of infrastructure facilities, power generation will qualify for exemptions if the task is taken up by the developer. But developers will have to start power generation, transmission and distribution operations by March 2010.

 Infrastructure facilities that will be exempted include housing, roads, water supply, water treatment, waste management, port and airports, sources added. 

 Meanwhile, the IT services industry is facing tough times because of the rising rupee. Every one percentage point appreciation will have an impact of between 30 and 40 basis points on the margin, said S. Gopalakrishnan, chief operating officer of Infosys Technologies. 

 Strengthening of the rupee would definitely have an impact on the margin, he had said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the CII in Bangalore. The estimates depend on the volume of business, the location and the currency, Gopalakrishnan said.

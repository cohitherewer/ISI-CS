 The memorandum of understanding between the two companies was signed in Visakhapatnam by P.K. Bishnoi, chairman and managing director of RINL, and T. Sankaralingam, chairman and managing director of NTPC. 

 The joint venture NTPC-RINL Power Company Ltd will meet the requirements of RINL. The JV company will have the right to supply surplus power to other bulk consumers in consultation with RINL at a rate mutually agreed upon by the two.

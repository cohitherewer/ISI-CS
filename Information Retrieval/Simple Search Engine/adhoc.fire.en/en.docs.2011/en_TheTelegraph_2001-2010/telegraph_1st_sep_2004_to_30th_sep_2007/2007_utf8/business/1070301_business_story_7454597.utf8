 SEZ tax break only for new firms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 28: If corporates were hoping to traipse into special economic zones and scoop up tax benefits, they will find themselves badly stymied.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram appears to have plugged a little legal loophole by tweaking a proviso in section 10 AA of the Income-Tax Act which makes it clear that the SEZ tax breaks will be limited to new companies that have started operations in the zone after April 1, 2006.

 But that isnt all: the new rules also specify that the companies qualifying for the tax benefit cannot be formed by splitting up, or reconstructing a business already in existence. Nor can it be formed by the transfer to a new business of machinery or plant previously used for any purpose.

 The SEZ policy provides companies tax deduction up to 100 per cent of the profits and gains derived from the export made in eligible business for a period of five consecutive assessment years beginning from the year in which such business commences. 

 It also provides a 50 per cent deduction on profits and gains for further five assessment years and thereafter.

 It provides a further tax deduction another five years of up to 50 per cent of the profit debited to the profit and loss account and credited to a reserve account to be created and utilised for the purposes of the business.

 A change in another section of the Income Tax Act section 80-IA holds greater interest and could spark a shakeout among SEZ developers. Proposals for over 400 SEZs have been made to the government and at last count over 250 proposals have received in-principle approval from the relevant authority.

 Despite Sonia Gadnhis strong reservations on the issue, the board of approvals under the commerce ministry has not baulked at issuing clearances.

 It is evident that several approvals are now held by companies that either do not have the money or the wherewithal to establish the zones and will be looking to bring some larger players on board as stakeholders.

 The government realises this only two well which is why it has set a March 31 deadline after which any merger or amalgamation of the developer with another entity will not qualify for the tax breaks.

 provisions of section 80-IA provide for 100 per cent deduction for ten years in respect of profits and gains of certain undertakings or enterprises engaged in the business of development, operation and maintenance of infrastructure facility, industrial parks and special economic zones.

 The same benefit is provided to entities involved in generation, distribution or transmission of power, and laying and operating a cross-country natural gas distribution network, including gas pipelines and storage facilities.

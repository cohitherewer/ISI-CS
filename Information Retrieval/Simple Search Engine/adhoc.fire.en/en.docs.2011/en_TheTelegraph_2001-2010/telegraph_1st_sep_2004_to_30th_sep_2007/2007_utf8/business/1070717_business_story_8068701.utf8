 Move to spur dollar outflows

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, July 16: Faced with a problem of too many dollars and euros in the countrys kitty, the Congress-led government may work out a package to encourage outflow of foreign exchange through investments abroad. 

 Rules allowing funds to invest abroad may be relaxed further and a limited number of treasuries and brokers may also be allowed into the field.

 It is also likely to place checks to see most of external commercial borrowings or foreign currency loans that companies raise abroad are spent on purchase of assets such as firms or mines abroad or on import of capital goods or raw material.

 Indias forex reserves have already swollen to $215 billion, and is being forecast to increase by another $40 billion by the end of this year. Net FDI inflows may top to $15 billion, almost double of last years $8.4 billion.

 A top official said the North Block would work out fresh relaxations for mutual funds who are already allowed to invest a portion of their funds abroad. 

 In May, the aggregate ceiling for overseas investment by mutual funds registered with capital market regulator Sebi was increased from $3 billion to $4 billion.

 Former RBI governor and head of the Prime Ministers panel on economy, C. Rangarajan, also said the government would work to limit the conversion of external commercial loans into rupee funds by companies that use this money for a variety of reasons within the country. 

 ECBs should be used up abroad to buy assets there or in procuring capital goods.

 India Inc, however, isnt much enthused by the new thinking on ECB utilisation and pointed out that with interest rates at a high in India, many would naturally tap foreign markets for cheaper loans, part of which would be used as working capital.

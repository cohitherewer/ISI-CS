 Stocks and bonds to bear the brunt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 30: Stocks and bonds are likely to be clobbered on Monday when the full impact of the RBIs monetary tightening weighs on a market that just didnt anticipate the measures.

 Lulled into a false sense of complacency after the Federal Reserve signalled that it wouldnt tweak rates this year, the market wasnt expecting surprise measures from the central bank.

 On the stock markets, the worst hit are likely to be banking, real estate and automobile shares. Bond prices are also expected to witness a major fall in reaction to the CRR and repo rate hike.

 While the RBI measures came after closure of market hours, observers, who were completely taken aback by the RBI move, said bank stocks could come under tremendous pressure. The CRR and the repo rate have been increased. This could impact banks investment portfolio as government security prices correct. But more than that, as the decision to bring down interest rate on CRR balances could hurt bank profitability, bank shares will be the worst sufferers come Monday, an analyst averred.

 He was of the view that as interest rates on car loans are likely to be raised next month, automobile stocks could be impacted as the demand for vehicles, particularly cars, may be hit. As a large portion of automobile sales are financed through banks, it is feared that many consumers will put off their demand for new vehicles due to an interest rate increase.

 DRL plans bid for Merck arm

 Gulp it down

 London, Feb. 24 (PTI): Dr Reddys Laboratories (DRL) is planning to bid for the generic arm of Merck, the German pharmaceutical company.

 We will take a look at it and then decide, G.V. Prasad, vice-chairman and chief executive officer of DRL, said.

 Prasad said any bid from Dr Reddys would be as part of a consortium, most likely to be backed by private equity.

 We dont have the size to do it on our own, Prasad, who was on a visit to London, told The Times.

 Hyderabad-based Dr Reddys, one of Indias largest manufacturers of generic medicines, already owns a small European generics business.

 We see the potential to grow that quite significantly, Prasad said.

 Germanys Merck said in January it was planning to sell its generic drugs business to help pay for its 7-billion acquisition of Serono, the Swiss biotechnology group.

 A sale of the Merck generics unit, which is believed to be worth between 3 billion euros and 4 billion euros, would allow Merck to concentrate on its core prescription pharmaceuticals business.

 Merck generics has sales in more than 90 countries and is the third-largest generics business in the world.

 In 2005 it reported sales of 1.8 billion euros and operating profits of 238 million euros. It has around 5,000 employees. 

 Prasad said Dr Reddys was aiming to achieve a revenue growth of 20-25 per cent in Europe from 2008 onwards.

 Globally, the company had sales of $546 million in 2006 and is Indias second-largest pharmaceutical company after Delhi-based Ranbaxy Laboratories.

 Ranbaxy and Icelands Actavis are also interested in buying Mercks generics business.

 Another Indian drug firm, Cipla, had earlier expressed interest but recently said the price was too high.

 Prasad said Indian generics business were likely to play a very important role in the development of the global generic medicines industry.

 India offers a vibrant chemical industry and the costs of manufacturing and infrastructure are still much lower, he said.

 Dr Reddys makes a range of generic drugs for different conditions. The company has a drug development unit, which is trailing drugs for diabetes, obesity and atherosclerosis.

 Tech titans to be conservative in guidance

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, April 11: The good news is that there will be no bungle in the tech jungle and titans like Infosys Technology wont find their fourth-quarter financials roiled by a rampant rupee or the sniff of a slowdown in the US economy.

 The pundits who pore over figures at brokerages reckon that the tech bandwagon wont report any surprises but could issue a conservative guidance in the next fiscal on account of these two factors.

 Infosys unveils its fourth-quarter results this Friday and the markets are eagerly waiting for the numbers.

 A strong rupee hurts infotech companies which earn a substantial chunk of their revenues in dollars.

 Although two IT companies iGate Global Solutions and Mastek announced their quarterly numbers and did not disappoint, the Infosys numbers always sets the tone for the earnings season. There have been apprehensions in recent months on account of the rupees surge against the dollar and a slowdown in the US economy, but analysts expect a better pricing environment and good volume growth to pull the IT firms through during the fourth quarter.

 On a more fundamental side, we believe the demand environment and pricing power would remain fairly stable versus the previous quarter. This makes us believe there may be a limited downside to stock prices from current levels, said Dipen Shah and Saurabh Gurnurkar of Kotak in their fourth quarter preview.

 However, analysts are not discounting the impact of rupee appreciation, slowdown in US economy or other factors such as the imposition of minimum alternate tax and fringe benefit tax on IT firms. 

 They feel this could lead to a conservative guidance from Infosys. A guidance from Infosys is always taken very seriously and it is usually seen that if the forecast is way below markets estimates, IT stocks take a beating. That the Bangalore-based company, on most occasions, betters this forecast is another issue.

 Given the uncertainty on the US economic outlook, surge in the rupee, and lack of clarity on imposition of FBT on ESOPs, we believe companies may strike a note of caution on the 2007-08 earnings growth outlook. Infosys will set the tone when it kicks off the results season on April 13 and provide guidance for the coming year, Merrill Lynch says in its results preview.

 Merrill Lynch is expecting an EPS guidance from Infosys in the region of 20 per cent for 2007-08 which could disappoint the market. Infosys saw the benefits of a sharp rupee appreciation, big volume growth during the first quarter of 2006-07. Given such a high base, it is feared that the first-quarter guidance from the company is likely to be dull.

 However, there are some optimists who feel that the rupee could soon start depreciating against the dollar. Moreover, amid a slowdown in the US, firms out there will continue to look at outsourcing in a bid to cut costs. This could turn out to be good news for domestic IT firms.

 The sectors that are seen to fall short of expectations include banks, automobiles and public sector oil firms.

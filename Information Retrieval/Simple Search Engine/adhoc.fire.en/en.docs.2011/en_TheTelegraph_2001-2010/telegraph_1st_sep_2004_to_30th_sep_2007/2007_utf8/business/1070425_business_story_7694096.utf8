The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 A step closer to full float of rupee

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 24: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today took a major stride towards full capital account convertibility by allowing individuals to invest or spend overseas up to $100,000 a year and permitted them to also hedge their foreign exchange exposures.

 The twin measures were part of a series of measures that the central bank unveiled in its annual policy statement for 2007-08.

 Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have also been allowed to hedge their foreign exchange exposures and they can book forward contracts (a contract according to which a seller agrees to deliver an asset to a buyer in the future) without them showing their past records of exports and imports. 

 The RBI also enhanced the overseas investment limit or total financial commitments for domestic companies from the existing limit of 200 per cent of their net worth to 300 per cent of their net worth. The limit placed on Indian companies portfolio investment abroad in listed overseas companies has also been enlarged to 35 per cent of their net worth from 25 per cent now. 

 Last October, the central bank had allowed individuals to invest up to $50,000 abroad from the earlier limit of $25,000. With the ceiling now being raised to $100,000, it is only implementing the recommendation of the S.S. Tarapore committee report on fuller capital account convertibility.

 Experts say this relaxation should also be seen in the context of the strong forex reserves which have already crossed $200 billion.

 For individuals, more particularly for the high net worth investors, this relaxation means they can now go ahead and buy Microsoft, Google or any other shares from the overseas markets.

 According to Nipun Mehta, co-founder amp; CEO, Unitis Tower Wealth Advisors Pvt Ltd, a wealth management firm, the measure gives an individual more investment options. Mehta points out that if an individual is not obtaining good returns here in India, he could diversify and invest abroad. He could invest in direct equity or private equity (those companies which are not listed), he told The Telegraph.

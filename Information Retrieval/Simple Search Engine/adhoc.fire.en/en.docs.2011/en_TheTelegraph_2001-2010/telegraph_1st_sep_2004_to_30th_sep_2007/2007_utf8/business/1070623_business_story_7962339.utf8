 Pain for one, gain for other 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 22: Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) came under pressure on the stock exchanges today. This follows the court ruling of yesterday that said the Mukesh Ambani-led company could not sell its KG basin gas to any firm except NTPC and Anil Ambani groups Reliance Natural Resources. 

 However, RNRL gained about 3 per cent on the bourses, while shares of Reliance Energy, another Anil Ambani group company, also firmed up by more than 5 per cent.

 The RIL share ended lower by 1.68 per cent, or Rs 29.10, to close at Rs 1704.05 on the BSE today. The stock was instrumental in pulling down the sensex by 32 points.

 RNRL gained 3.09 per cent to close at Rs 35.05, after hitting an intra-day high of Rs 36.90.

 Brokers expect the RIL scrip to face some more pressure in the immediate term. High expectations were built around the gas from the KG basin because of its implications on RILs balancesheet. Therefore, the order can be seen as an initial setback to the company, a broker said.

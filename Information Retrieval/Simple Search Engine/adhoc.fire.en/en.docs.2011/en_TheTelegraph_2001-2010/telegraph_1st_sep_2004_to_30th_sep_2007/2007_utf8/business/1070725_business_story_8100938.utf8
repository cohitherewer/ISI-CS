 Calcutta, July 24: The Dhamra port in Orissa is exploring the option of turning itself into a special economic zone (SEZ).

 The 50:50 joint venture between Tata Steel and Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) is coming up on a 900-acre plot on the Orissa coast. Dhamra Port Company Ltd (DPCL) plans to develop two berths, at an investment of Rs 2,400 crore, to handle bulk cargo such as coal and iron ore.

 Santosh K. Mohapatra, chief executive officer of the company, said contractors had been appointed and orders placed for the project.

 We hope to complete the first phase, capable of handling 25 million tonnes of cargo, by April 2010, he said.

 Asked if the company planned to seek SEZ status, he said such an idea was being considered. Many upcoming private sector ports across the country are turning themselves into SEZs to take advantage of liberal tax rules. 

 To begin with, the Dhamra port will handle raw materials for steel plants coming up in Kalinganagar and in nearby areas. Tata Steel itself is building a 6mt plant at Kalinganagar. Later we may consider to have port-based industries there, Mohapatra said.

 Eventually the Dhamra port will be equipped to handle 85mt cargo capacity with 13 berths.

 Tata Steel and L amp;T are contributing Rs 250 crore each as equity for the project, while the remaining Rs 1,900 crore will be raised as debt from eight banks led by IDBI.

 The company will also build a 62km rail track from the port to Bhadrak, which will connect with the Howrah-Chennai trunk route. The company will require 2,200 acres for that, taking the total land requirement of the whole project to 3,100 acres. 

 Mohapatra, who was in Calcutta to attend a programme organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, called for state agencies to associate themselves in building associated infrastructure for the port.

 SCI borrowing

 The Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) is planning to raise $300 million through the external commercial borrowing (ECB) route to part finance its fleet acquisition. S Hajara, chairman and managing director of SCI, said orders would be placed for six ships within two weeks.

 This would cost $400 million or Rs 1,600 crore to the company, he said at the sideline of the CII programme. This year SCI would spend Rs 3,000 crore on fleet acquisition.

 Rail plan

 Indian Railways has proposed a whopping Rs 251,000 crore investment in the 11th Five Year plan. The draft proposal to this effect has been submitted to the Planning Commission.

 V. N. Mathur, member traffic of the Railway Board, said Rs 90,000 crore would come from internal accruals while about 29 per cent would be borrowed, including ECB.

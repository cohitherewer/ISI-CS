 Mumbai/Calcutta, Aug. 6: RPG Enterprises will merge three companies dealing in power transmission to create the worlds largest manufacturer of towers. Under the rejig scheme, RPG Transmission (RPGT) and unlisted National Information Technologies (NITEL) will be merged into KEC International.

 A swap ratio of four KEC shares for nine RPGT shares and two KEC shares for 15 NITEL shares have been proposed. The boards of all three companies have cleared the merger. 

 The merger is a step towards restructuring the Rs 11,000-crore group with a few big companies having strong balance sheets.

 Recently, the group merged its retail business Spencers with power utility CESC.

 Music company Saregama India is also consolidating operations by merging Saregama Films with itself.

 The group wants to enhance shareholder value by creating focused companies, a source said.

 It has hived off investments of over Rs 400 crore of Ceat India to a separate entity.

 The merger announced today is more about realising cost benefit through various synergies and building economies of scale.

 This merger will enable KEC, one of the largest transmission equipment companies in the world with operations in over 16 countries, to leverage manufacturing synergies, capital, human resources and technical expertise to grow its business and enhance shareholder value. The telecom expertise through NITEL provides operational and marketing synergies, KEC said in a statement today. 

 KEC is engaged in setting up power transmission lines, power distribution networks, railway electrification and telecommunication towers, while RPGT is involved in EPC contracting in transmission and rural electrification, a business similar to that of KEC. NITEL builds and operates telecom infrastructure. 

 The transaction will combine three business entities with complementary assets and skills and enhance KECs resource base, service offering and geographical reach, KEC managing director Ramesh Chandak told reporters in Mumbai.

 He added that the merger would also achieve cost synergies through rationalisation of administrative functions. Operational synergies will be achieved through project and asset management. 

 Moreover, it will also help KEC diversify into high-growth telecom infrastructure business. 

 NITELs experience will guide KECs entry into the telecom infrastructure tower business. 

 NITEL has bagged four clusters under the Universal Service Obligation (USO) Fund, which includes setting up of 384 telecom towers in rural areas within 12 to 18 months. 

 The company has created telecom infrastructure for players like Reliance Communications, Bharti Airtel and Tata Teleservices.

 Final check before Jet-Sahara takeoff

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 11: Jet Airways and Air Sahara have virtually sealed a deal that will pave the way for the Naresh Goyal-promoted airline to acquire the latter for at least Rs 1,450 crore. 

 A draft jointly prepared by both the sides on the deal is likely to be presented before a three-member arbitration tribunal tomorrow.

 The final draft of Jet-Air Sahara deal will be completed tonight and will be presented to the arbitration panel tomorrow for a final decision, Jet Airways counsel Harish Salve told newspersons here. 

 He added that while the deal was a big one, there were certain changes that had to be carried out in the original share purchase agreement (SPA), which would be rewarded and finalised by tonight. 

 Although officials from both the airlines refrained from making any comment, it is understood that both the sides were preparing rough drafts on the deal till late evening. Though there were few minor differences between the two sides, those were largely limited to the fine-print of the deal. The two sides are likely to bring out a joint order after evaluating each others proposals. 

 The draft order could be presented to the arbitration panel comprising British judge Lord Stein, Justices S.P. Bharucha and Justice Jeevan Reddy on Thursday.

 It is also learnt that they are likely to get a consent decree from the panel. Such a decree, sources said, is likely to be more effective as it has the force of a court order.

 Though the consideration that Jet Airways will pay to Air Sahara for the acquisition could still not be ascertained, sources continue to put it between Rs 1,450 crore and Rs 1,800 crore, after adjusting for arrears, interest and liabilities. It is believed that as Jet has already paid Rs 500 crore as advance in lieu of the shares pledged by Sahara last year, there will be at least Rs 950 crore that could be paid in cash. 

 If the acquisition goes through, the deal would give Jet more than 32 per cent of the domestic aviation market in passenger terms and add at least 27 aircraft to its 62-aircraft fleet. This is in addition to prime landing and take-off slots and certain international destinations.

 Some analysts see the deal benefiting Jet Airways in the long run. The scrip met with selling pressure at the stock exchanges today as market participants were apprehensive about the near-term impact on its financials.

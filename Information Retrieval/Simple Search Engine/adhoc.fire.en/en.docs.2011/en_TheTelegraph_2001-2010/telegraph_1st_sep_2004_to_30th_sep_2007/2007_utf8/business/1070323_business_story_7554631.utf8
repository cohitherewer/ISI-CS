 Chip policy notified

 New Delhi, March 22 (PTI): The government has notified the much-awaited semiconductor policy, providing capital subsidy to investors setting up chip manufacturing units in India.

 The government expects to attract an investment of Rs 24,000 crore in the next three years. The country is likely to have two-three fab units at an investment of $2-3 billion each by 2010, minister for IT and communications Dayanidhi Maran said.

 An appraisal committee to be headed by the additional secretary in the department of IT will be formed soon. The committee will receive expressions of interest from interested parties and will submit its recommendations to the government, he said.

 Maran said now that the policy has been notified, he will reopen negotiations with Intel and other companies to explore possibilities of them setting up units in the country.

 Intel had been waiting for the semiconductor policy to take decisions on its India plans and had, in the meantime, selected Vietnam for a facility.

 The Union cabinet had earlier approved the policy. The subsidy will be in the form of tax breaks and interest-free loans. The incentives will be 20 per cent of the capital expenditure during the first 10 years, but the companies have to invest a minimum Rs 2,500 crore. Such units will have to be set up in special economic zones to avail of this benefit.

 If the unit is located outside SEZ, the incentive would be 25 per cent of the capital subsidy in the first 10 years and countervailing duty on capital goods would be exempted.

 The threshold investment limit for manufacturing other products like storage devices, micro and nano technology products, assembly and testing of all these products and organic light emitting diodes is Rs 1,000 crore.

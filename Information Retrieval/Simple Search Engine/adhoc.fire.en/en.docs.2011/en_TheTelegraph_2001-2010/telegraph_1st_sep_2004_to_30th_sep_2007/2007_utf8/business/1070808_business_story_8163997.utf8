 Srei ready to board Colombo metro

 Kanoria: New vistas

 Calcutta, Aug. 7: Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd has been appointed by the Sri Lankan government to prepare a report on the proposed 23km metro rail project in Colombo. 

 This is part of the companys diversification into mass rapid transport system.

 We are also looking at similar projects in Mauritius, said Hemant Kanoria, managing director of Srei Infrastructure Finance. 

 The company has tied up with the Land Transport Authority of Singapore to carry out a feasibility study on the metro rail project.

 The report will be ready in three months. If the Sri Lankan government approves the financial model submitted by Srei, it will form a joint venture and work on the capital structure of the project. 

 However, Srei would give the Land Transport Authority the first preference to be a partner in the joint venture company, said Naveen Bansal, vice-president of Srei Infrastructure Finance.

 The feasibility study for the project will cost around $4-5 million. 

 Initially, Srei will bear the cost, but it will be later reimbursed by the Sri Lankan government. The project is estimated at $1.5-2 billion, excluding the cost involved in preparing the report.

 City project

 Srei has already submitted an expression of interest for the light-rail transport project in the city. As part of the consortium with SembCorp of Singapore and Essar, the company has also placed its bid for the proposed Hyderabad metro rail project.

 Overseas project development and advisory services are expected to contribute 30 to 40 per cent to Sreis net profit in the next two to three years, up from 10 per cent now.

 Srei is focusing on the rapid transport system after its decision to hive off the infrastructure equipment financing business to Srei Infrastructure Development Finance, a 50:50 joint venture formed with the BNP Paribas Lease group.

 Srei Infrastructure Development Finance will commence operations before the end of the current calendar year, subject to shareholders approval.

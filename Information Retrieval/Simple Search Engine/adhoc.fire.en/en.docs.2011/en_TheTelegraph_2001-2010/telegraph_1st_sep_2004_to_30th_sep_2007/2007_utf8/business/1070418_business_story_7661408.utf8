 Calpers gives top marks

 New Delhi, April 17 (PTI): California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), the largest pension fund in the us, has recognised India as one of the best performers among the emerging markets in its investment policy report for 2007, which was approved by its board yesterday.

 Calpers has investments of about $1 billion in over 55 Indian stocks, which represents over 260 per cent return since the purchase of these stocks. Market experts feel Calpers will expand its exposure in the Indian stock market, as it has given impressive returns ever since it began investing here in 2004.

 For 2007, the Calpers board has decided to invest in 20 emerging markets, including Argentina, Brazil, India, Israel, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Turkey.

 The decision was based on a report by its consultant, Wilshire Associates, which reviewed country and financial market factors such as political stability, transparency and labour practices of 27 emerging markets.

 According to the report, India and the Philippines made the biggest improvement in 2006. While a total of 10 markets improved their scores, two (Hungary and Poland) moved down the ranks and 15 kept their scores unchanged during the year.

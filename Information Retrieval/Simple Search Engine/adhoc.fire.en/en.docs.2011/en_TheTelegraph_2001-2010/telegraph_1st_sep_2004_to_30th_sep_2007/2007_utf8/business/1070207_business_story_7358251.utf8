 Toyota net races ahead

Tokyo, Feb.6 (Reuters): Toyota Motor has posted a near-20 per cent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday on brisk sales in North America and Europe. The company kept its forecast for a seventh straight year of record earnings intact. 

 Japans top auto maker is cruising past rivals at home and abroad, riding on the reputation of making energy-efficient cars, boosted by the halo effect from its popular Prius hybrid and backed by a steady stream of new products such as the RAV4 crossover, Lexus LS and Camry sedans. 

 Toyotas results confirmed its lead over domestic rivals, Honda Motor and Nissan Motor, which announced disappointing quarterly results last week. 

 Toyota is storming the United States, winning sales from General Motors and Ford Motor, both of which are undergoing restructuring. GM, Ford and Chrysler all lost market share to Asian brands last year. 

 Last month, Toyota snatched the No.2 spot in the US market from Ford with an adjusted 5 per cent increase in sales. The Camry was again the top-selling car in the US last year. 

 Toyota, already the worlds most valuable automaker with a market worth $230 billion and poised to take over as the top carmaker by volume, kept its forecast for full-year operating profit of 2.2 trillion yen ($18.31 billion) and net profit of 1.55 trillion yen. 

 But those projections are based on conservative assumptions for the dollar to average 115 yen and the euro to trade at 145 yen during the final quarter, leaving room for an overshoot. We want to do a little bit better than 2.2 trillion yen (operating profit) since the yen is weaker, Toyota senior managing director Takeshi Suzuki said.

 The October-December operating profit rose 19 per cent to 574.79 billion yen ($4.78 billion), with higher vehicle sales helping to add 120 billion yen. The weaker yen contributed a quarter of that, while cost-cutting efforts added 20 billion yen. 

 Net profit rose 7.3 per cent to 426.77 billion yen, well ahead of market estimates for a fall to 375.5 billion yen from a year earlier.

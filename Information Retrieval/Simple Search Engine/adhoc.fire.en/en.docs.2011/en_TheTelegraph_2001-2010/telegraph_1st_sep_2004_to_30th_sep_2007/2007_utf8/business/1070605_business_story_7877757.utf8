 Subsidy push to green fuels

 New Delhi, June 4: Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia today proposed subsidies for developing hydrogen as an auto fuel. 

 Speaking at a CII conclave, Ahluwalia said, The cost of developing the fuel is high, but it can be managed if the government subsidises the project. However, we need to decide whether subsidies should be given to existing applications or on research. 

 He said the technology was not economical and unless subsidised, the fuel would not be commercially viable.

 If recognised as a potential energy resource, it can be initially subsidised. However, it is unlikely to become a plausible solution in energy security if it remains subsidised perpetually, said Ahluwalia. He said existing research could be leveraged and a business model devised for the commercialisation of hydrogen fuel technology.

 Speaking on the occasion, Tata Sons chairman Ratan Tata appeared optimistic about the viability of hydrogen fuel. He, however, said generation, storage and delivery issues would pose a problem.

 Tata, who chaired the Steering Committee of National Hydrogen Energy Board, said, Although the technology remains elusive, the challenges are not insurmountable to get the initiative on track.

 He added that Tata Motors was participating in the development of alternative fuels. New and renewable energy minister Vilas Muttemwar said the National Hydrogen Energy Roadmap had proposed two initiatives to develop hydrogen-powered engines and fuel cell-based automobiles, including two-wheelers and heavy vehicles. 

 The road map envisages that by 2020 about one million hydrogen-fuelled vehicles, of which about 75 per cent are expected to be two or three-wheelers and the rest cars, taxis and buses, will be on Indian roads, he said.

 Tata said, We use vehicles run on bio-fuel for our employees in our campuses. We are also developing vehicles which are flexi-fuel. In the future, all petrol vehicles from Tata Motors will have the capability to run on bio-fuels.

 BSNL, Airtel to cut roaming rates

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, May 31: State-run BSNL is planning to cut domestic mobile roaming charges to as low as Re 1 a minute for incoming calls and Rs 1.50 for outgoing calls.

 Reliance Communications was the first to slash roaming tariffs and more companies are expected to follow suit. R-Com cut roaming rates on outgoing calls by up to 70 per cent to Rs 0.40 per minute on select plans. The company also introduced a flat Re 1 per minute roaming rate for incoming calls for post-paid plans, down from Rs 1.75 earlier.

 Sources in Bharti Airtel said the company would come up with a roaming rate discount within a couple of days. MTNL is also working on a new reduced roaming tariff structure.

 Bharat Sanchar Nigam now charges Rs 1.75 per 60 seconds on an incoming roaming call, while for outgoing calls the rate is a maximum Rs 2.40 a minute. However, it is not possible to cut the rates any further as there is a 65 paise carriage charge and 30 paise termination charge involved, which have to be covered when a person receives an incoming call while roaming, said a BSNL official.

 Telecom minister A. Raja had earlier said that his department was looking at the possibility of lowering the domestic roaming charges as planned by his predecessor Dayanidhi Maran.

 Maran had said he planned to abolish the domestic roaming charges as a gift to the nation on the occasion of his party (DMK) president M. Karunanidhis birthday on June 3. 

 The BSNL official, however, said not charging a subscriber for roaming calls is impossible as national long distance telecom charges apply.

 There is, however, a possibility of incoming calls being made free for a limited number of minutes during roaming. 

 BSNL is working on 4-5 tariff plans to accommodate these changes and will announce details tomorrow. The officials said the plans could carry higher rentals.

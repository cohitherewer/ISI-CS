 Plan outlay hike hope for tea

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

Calcutta, June 17: The Tea Board has sent a proposal to the Planning Commission and the finance ministry to increase the eleventh plan outlay on welfare schemes to Rs 50 crore from Rs 4 crore in the tenth plan.

 This comes at a time when workers have died in closed tea gardens and the health infrastructure has come under scrutiny. There has also been a lack of alternative employment opportunities.

 The Tea Board will discuss the proposal on plan outlay with the Planning Commission and the ministry of finance and we hope to get it approved in the next few weeks, a Tea Board source said.

 The board has also proposed drawing up rural development schemes for the plantation sector. The commerce ministry will discuss the proposal with its agriculture counterpart. 

 The schemes will include stipends for workers children who opt for higher education and improvement of infrastructure facilities such as health, sanitation and water.

 A budget of Rs 10 crore a year will enable the Tea Board to run many more programmes in gardens across the country, an official said.

 Currently, there are 33 closed gardens, of which 17 are in Kerala, 14 in Bengal and two in Assam.

 The gardens earlier did not enjoy the benefits of rural development schemes run by the panchayats as they were private property.

 Under a notification in 1998, the gardens were brought under panchayats. The board will start a pilot programme of panchayat development schemes in three gardens of Andrew Yule in Jalpaiguri.

 Though there are a few private companies that have allowed panchayats to run some of their programmes, the numbers are negligible. We chose a PSU to experiment with a few of the panchayat schemes which will be modified to suit the needs of the gardens, added the official.

 Of the 30 lakh workers employed in the industry, only 12 lakh are engaged throughout the year. The rest work on a rotational basis.

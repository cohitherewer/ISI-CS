 Cavinkare plans local buyouts

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, July 15: Chennai-based Cavinkare group is planning to buy domestic companies with a turnover of Rs 150-200 crore.

 The group may consider an initial public offering within the next two years after the acquisition is completed.

 We see inorganic growth as a way to ramp up our capacity as we hope to aggressively target the markets in the US, the UK and Egypt. We plan to invest around Rs 100 crore in the next two to three years in our overseas markets, chairman and managing director C.K. Ranganathan said.

 The company markets 10 major brands like Fairever, Spinz, Nyle, Meera, Chik, Tex, Indica and food products such as Ruchi and Chinni. 

 Cavinkare also has 25 beauty salons Green Trends for the mass market and Limelite for the premium. 

 The group plans to end this fiscal with a turnover of Rs 650 crore, up from Rs 500 crore last fiscal. The group has been growing at 20 per cent per annum.

 Personal care contributed Rs 350 crore to the companys topline. 

 To ramp up capacity, the FMCG company has invested in a greenfield capacity in Hardwar for Rs 75 crore. This will ramp up production from 60,000 to 80,000 tonnes per annum. The company has five distributors in the US and is in the process of consolidating its brand presence there as well as in the UK. It is also exploring the market in Egypt.

 It has tied up with Spinneys for West Asia and Aipco for the Saudi Arabian market.

 The company will also step up its presence in countries such as Bangladesh, Singapore, Nepal, Malaysia and Myanmar.

 The company could also look at private equity funding initially for its expansion.

 Ranganathan said the chain of beauty salons in Chennai, Bangalore and New Delhi would be expanded from 25 to more than 60 by the end of this fiscal.

 We plan to invest around Rs 25 crore to set up more Limelite and Green Trends salons in the metros as well as in other smaller cities. We will bring these two chains of family salons to Bengal sometime next year, said Ranganathan.

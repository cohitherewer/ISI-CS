The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Nasdaq within reach

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 7: Some domestic brokerage houses may soon offer share trading facility on US bourses. 

 Ghanshyam Dass, Nasdaqs managing director for the Asia Pacific region, said a number of Indian brokerage houses have already applied for registration with the US stock exchange. 

 In my knowledge, ICICI Securities and HDFC Securities have cleared the seven-step test qualifying for registration. They may soon start offering the facility to domestic investors to trade in shares listed on Nasdaq. Besides, some foreign brokerage houses, such as UBS and Charles Schawb Brokerage, are also planning to come to India. All this will pave the way for investors here to trade in securities on Nasdaq, Dass said while speaking at an interactive session organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce here today. 

 He, however, declined to make any comment on Nasdaqs plan to pick up stakes in any of the Indian bourses.

 Trading on overseas bourses by domestic investors, mutual funds and retail investors has not picked up despite the fact that investment limits were raised last year. 

 The government last year increased investment limit for mutual funds in overseas stocks to $2 billion, with select fund houses permitted to invest around $1 billion more in exchange traded funds abroad. Retail investors are allowed to invest $50,000 in a year in stocks listed on foreign stock exchanges.

 As of now, there are no brokerage houses in the country offering share trading in overseas bourses, said Dass. 

 The tax implications are also detrimental to investing in stocks abroad. While there is no long-term capital gains tax on investments in the domestic equity market, investments in overseas stocks attract a long-term capital gains tax at the rate of 10 per cent without cost indexation or 20 per cent with cost indexation.

 Sensex atop new peak

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 12: The stock market today scaled a new high, riding on strong growth in industrial production, firm global advices and the governments decision to amend the banking regulation act. 

 The 30-share sensex opened with a wide gap of nearly 100 points and later surged to an all-time intra-day high of 14070.88 before ending at a new closing peak of 14056.53, a net gain of 425.82 points or 3.12 per cent over yesterdays close of 13630.71. 

 After a fall of about 500 points in the first three trading sessions this week, the benchmark index rose nearly 700 points in two trading sessions. 

 The broader nifty also peaked to 4052.45, a sharp rise of 110.20 points or 2.80 per cent over the previous close of 3942.25. 

 The banking scrips were clearly in the limelight today, which saw the BSE Bankex surging by a record 469.40 points or 6.79 per cent to end at a new record high of 7383.25. 

 Among the banks, ICICI Bank jumped over 8 per cent to an all-time closing high of Rs 970.10 on the Bombay Stock Exchange. State Bank of India jumped 6.39 per cent to Rs 1,223.45, HDFC Bank rose 6.39 per cent to Rs 1,063.25, while housing finance major HDFC gained over 4 per cent to Rs 1,586.40. UTI Bank, which announced its results today closed 3.85 per cent up at Rs 499.20. 

 The strong beginning of the earnings season with robust numbers from Infosys, HDFC Bank and UTI Bank aided the rally. The market sentiment was also boosted by the governments decision to lift the ban on export of sugar, which saw the scrips of Balrampur Chini Mills, Dhampur Sugar Mills and Bajaj Hindustan rise on the bourses. 

 According to brokers, short-covering in the derivatives segment also aided in taking the sensex and nifty to their respective all-time highs. 

 All 30 index-based counters scored smart gains and the market breadth was highly positive with 1,635 gainers against 1,048 losers in total 2,723 traded shares. The trading volume improved further to Rs 4,608 crore from Rs 4,442.79 crore on Thursday. 

 The TCS scrip also hit a lifetime high today at Rs 1,330 before closing the day at Rs 1,325.30, up Rs 48.10 or 3.77 per cent from yesterdays close of Rs 1,277.20. The stock, which opened at Rs 1,300 had its days low at Rs 1,277.20. It clocked a turnover of 4.7 lakh shares on the BSE.

 Rupee recovery

 The gains in the stock market coupled with a further slump in global oil prices got extended to the forex market with the rupee making a smart recovery against the dollar on fresh dollar sales. With steep fall in world crude oil prices, which plunged below the $52-per-barrel-level, oil PSUs who had bought dollar at higher rates, offloaded, resulting in firming up of the rupee, dealers said. The rupee gained 17 paise to close at 44.43 today.

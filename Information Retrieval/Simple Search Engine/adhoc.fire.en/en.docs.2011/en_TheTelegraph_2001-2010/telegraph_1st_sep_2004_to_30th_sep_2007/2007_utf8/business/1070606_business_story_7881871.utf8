 Key role for Andamans in aquaculture

 Ramesh: Big plans

 New Delhi, June 5: The government is planning to promote the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as an aquaculture hub to boost marine exports. 

 Minister of state for commerce Jairam Ramesh said Indias marine export basket was dependent on shrimps. So, the government has decided to start tuna farming in the islands. The project will be launched in the first week of July and will be based on the public-private partnership model.

 Ramesh said the government has earmarked Rs 23 crore to breed artemia in the islands. Artemia is a feed for shrimps. India coughs up Rs 50 crore every year to import it from the US.

 The environment in the Andaman and Nicobar islands is similar to the Salt Lake City in the US from where artemia is sourced, Ramesh said. 

 The project will be ready by mid-2009 and the feedstock will be supplied to the hatcheries in the country. The government will also look at promoting exports to China and Japan.

 However, the European Union and the US continue to be the important markets for marine exports with a 34 per cent and 16 per cent share respectively. The minister said the countrys marine exports was stagnating at around $1.25 billion for a decade. However, the exports touched $1.64 billion in 2005-06 and $1.85 billion in 2006-07. The target for 2007-08 was $2 billion.

 The Eleventh Plan allocation to promote exports has been increased to Rs 500 crore from Rs 200 crore in the Tenth Plan as it is a labour-intensive industry, he added. The annual plan outlay for 2007-08 has been fixed at Rs 80 crore. 

 Ramesh said plans were also being drawn up to promote aquaculture in the brackish waters in Maharashtra and Gujarat as the potential in these states had not been exploited.

 While Bengal has exploited 15 per cent of its brackish water potential, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh have harnessed as much as 40 per cent and 64 per cent respectively. Karnataka and Kerala have succeeded in tapping 46 per cent and 23 per cent respectively.

 Gupta: For a cause

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: The government today said the Competition Commission of India (CCI), set up to safeguard the interest of consumers against misuse of market dominance by large companies, would become fully operational by mid-2008.

 Parliament had passed the Competition Amendment Bill, 2007 on Thursday, paving the way to set up a competition regulator in the country. The Rajya Sabha today approved the Bill also. 

 The bill, moved by corporate affairs minister Prem Chand Gupta, was passed in the Upper House in the midst of an uproar by NDA members over the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 It has a provision for a three-member quasi-judicial body, Competition Appellate Tribunal, to hear appeals against any direction issued by the Commission. 

 It also seeks to empower the CCI to impose a penalty of up to Rs 25 crore or up to three-year imprisonment or both in cases of continued contravention of its orders if the chief metropolitan magistrate deems fit. The commission will be operational after necessary notification and changes in the rules and composition of the commission, Gupta said. 

 The changes to the act make it clear that the commission will act as an expert body to prevent and regulate anti-competitive practices, while the proposed competition appellate tribunal will undertake judicial functions.

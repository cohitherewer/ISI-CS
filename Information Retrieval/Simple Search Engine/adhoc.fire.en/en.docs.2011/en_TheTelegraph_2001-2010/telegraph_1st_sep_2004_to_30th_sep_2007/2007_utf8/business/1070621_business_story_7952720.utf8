 Bata game plan for retail rejig 

 SAMBIT SAHA

 IN NEW SHOES

 Calcutta, June 20: Bata will close 70 unviable stores, run new shops with outsourced staff, introduce high-end superstores and extend business hours as part of a retail restructuring drive. 

 Bata, a leader in footwear business in India with a 35.1 per cent share, expects to pay dividends to shareholders if it can sustain and increase its profitability through such measures. The company set off its accumulated loss of Rs 50 crore last year.

 Bata has identified 140 stores as cash drain units whose losses have hit the companys bottomline. 

 These stores are unviable in todays market, a Bata official said. The company will transfer the employees of these closed shops to other existing stores.

 However, Bata will run all new stores with outsourced employees, a common practice in the retail sector in India.

 The Bata management had a row with shop employees in the recent past. This model could weed out such labour problems in the future.

 The company introduced this system in select stores last year. This is a very successful business model where the company has a chance to reduce employee cost in the long run, the official said.

 Bata opened 37 stores in 2006 and remodelled 78 existing ones. It plans to open 200 stores in the next three years.

 Batas expansion drive comes close on the heels of a successful negotiation with shop employees and managers to keep retail outlets open for seven days a week and longer hours during February-April.

 The company has introduced a three-tiered retailing structure to cater to various consumer segments. 

 At the top are Batas flagship stores in posh metro localities. Targeted at the higher income groups, these stores stock top-of-the-line brands and a trendy and fashionable shoe line. The flagship stores are air-conditioned, luxurious and wear an international look.

 Next come family stores in high-traffic, commercial locations displaying basic and middle-range footwear. These are non air-conditioned stores with a commercial look and mass display. 

 At the bottom are bazaar stores which target volume sales at lower price points.

 Bata has also brought in some changes in manufacturing and wholesale stores.

 Around 946 people have been retired in the manufacturing department in 2006. A stringent credit policy was initiated during the same period in wholesale trade, reducing credit from 126 days in 2005 to 45 days in 2006.

 More taxes, all the way

 The devil is in the details. Its true for the budget this year. Not only will you have to shell out 1 per cent additional educational cess on all types of taxes you pay income tax, service tax and TDS, but tax will also be deducted at source on your interest income from investments in 8 per cent RBI Savings (Taxable) Bonds 2003. 

 The RBI first came out with these bonds in April 2003, paying an annual interest of 8 per cent under both cumulative and non-cumulative options. Though the interest income on these bonds is taxable, so far taxes were not deducted at source following the RBIs directive in January 2004. 

 Section 193 of the income tax act excludes any interest payable on central or state government securities from deduction of tax at source and, consequently, tax was not being deducted on interest payable on 8 per cent Savings (Taxable) Bonds 2003.

 However, clause 43 of the Finance Bill has proposed to amend this section to provide for TDS on interest income in excess of Rs 10,000 from these bonds during a financial year. The amendment will come into effect from June 1 this year.

 This proposal reminds one of the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme, where TDS was not applicable initially but the government later on decided to deduct tax at source and on interest paid in the previous years, too. 

 But it is not yet clear whether investors will have to pay the taxes not deducted during the previous years. The finance ministry and the Reserve Bank are expected to come out soon with a notification on this. 

 The two incidents Senior Citizen Savings Scheme and 8 per cent Savings (Taxable) Bond indicates that the government may also bring post office schemes such as National Savings Certificate under TDS.

 The Finance Bill 2007, however, has something to cheer about also. 

 Clause 21 of the bill seeks to amend section 80E of the income tax act under which tax deduction on repayment of an educational loan was available only to the student. 

 The Finance Bill 2007 proposes the extend the deduction benefit to any individual who would have taken a loan for higher education either for himself/herself, for spouse or for children. 

 Parents can now take an educational loan for their children and claim deduction on the entire amount of interest payment on the loan. This amendment will come into effect from April 1, 2008.

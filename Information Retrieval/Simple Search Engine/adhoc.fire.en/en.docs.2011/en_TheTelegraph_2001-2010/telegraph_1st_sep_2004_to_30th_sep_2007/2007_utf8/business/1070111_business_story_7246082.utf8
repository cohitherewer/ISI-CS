 Rump stake sale on cabinet agenda

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: The Union cabinet will tomorrow finalise the policy on sale of residual stakes in PSUs. 

 A possible option before the cabinet is the sale of such stakes in the open market. 

 Consensus on this option is emerging in the wake of the attorney-generals repeated insistence that a call option in the agreement on share sale between the government and the private party is null and void under Section 111 of the companies act.

 The attorney general has advised the government not to allow the strategic buyer exercise the call option on its rump holdings.

 Government officials said that many of the 11 state-run firms and 19 hotels sold to companies through strategic sales had call and put options in the agreements. 

 If invoked by private parties, the clauses made it mandatory for the government to sell the residual stakes.

 However, attorney general Milon Bannerjee has ruled that these options were null and void as they contravened the laws. 

 The department of disinvestment has now brought the issue before cabinet for a decision on these shares. 

 The attorney generals advice has opened up three options before the government hold on to the rump stake, sell the stake to the public or sell it to an industrial group. 

 These strategic sales usually saw the government selling a limited shareholding in PSUs owned by it with clauses which gave them the first right of refusal in buying remainder holdings in those state run firms. 

 The only company to exercise the call is Hindustan Zinc, where Sterlite bought out a second tranche of 26 per cent for Rs 446 crore. There have been no other instances of sale through call or put options. Put option is the reverse of the call option giving the seller similar rights on future sales.

 The government has sold 51 per cent in CMC Ltd, 74 per cent in Hindustan Teleprinters Ltd and an equal amount in Paradeep Phosphates. It has recently sold a 72 per cent stake in Jessop to the PK Ruia group and 25 per cent in IPCL to Reliance.

 The issue flared up when Sterlite exercised the call option in Balco last year. Banerjee opposed any sale to Sterlite, which had bought a controlling stake in Balco and was pressing the government to accept a call option for the remaining 49 per cent.

 This forced the government to stall the sale of the residual stake and return the cheque for Rs 1,098.89 crore which Sterlite had drawn up in favour of the government to buy out the shares.

 In the case of Balco, Bannerjee had cited the Companies Act 1956 and Indian Contract Act 1872 and said the provision of valuation date and call option do not survive and consequently ... cannot .... bind the Government of India to accept the same.

 This is not the first time that a controversy has erupted over strategic sales. Political uproar as well as adverse comments by auditors had forced the government to change valuation guidelines last year. 

 The practice of valuing firms on the discounted flow method was dropped in favour of market valuation of assets. The new method is acceptable to the Congress and the Left. 

 When Balco was sold for Rs 550 crore, Congress leader Kapil Sibal had argued in Parliament that the sale price of the PSU should have been around Rs 3,000 crore based on the asset valuation method.

 One of the cases to be taken up is the call option in VSNL. The cabinet would discuss the legal validity of the option in case the Tatas decide to exercise it. The ministry of finance has moved the cabinet to discuss the legal validity of such a scenario if the Tata group decides to raise its holdings in VSNL.

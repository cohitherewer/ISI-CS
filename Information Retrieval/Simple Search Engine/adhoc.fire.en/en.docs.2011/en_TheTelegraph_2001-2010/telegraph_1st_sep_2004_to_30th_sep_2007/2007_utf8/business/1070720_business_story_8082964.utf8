 Rupee rise takes toll on Wipro

 Mumbai, July 19: Wipro has reported disappointing first-quarter numbers as the rupees appreciation has hit its margins. 

 The Bangalore-based company, which is Indias third-largest software exporter, saw a 17 per cent growth in net profit during the first quarter of this year at Rs 725.6 crore compared with Rs 620.4 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal. 

 Analysts had estimated that Wipro could post a net profit of Rs 750 crore during the quarter. Wipros results come after Infosys disappointed the Street with a lower guidance even as Tata Consulting Services weathered the rupee rise with a variety of measures. Analysts said for every per cent rise in the value of the rupee, the margins of IT companies are hit by 50 basis points. 

 During the quarter, operating margins of Wipros IT services came down to 21 per cent from 25 per cent in the corresponding period of last year. The company posted a total income (consolidated) of Rs 4,203.3 crore against Rs 3,142.5 crore in the same quarter last fiscal. 

 However, Wipro chairman Azim Premji said the results were satisfying considering the challenging circumstances in the form of an appreciating rupee. Our IT services business continued to witness broad-based growth across verticals, geographies and service lines. Our growth in revenues was primarily driven by strong volume growth across our business units, he said. 

 Chief financial officer Suresh Senapaty said Wipros global IT services and products revenue was $726.1 million, which was ahead of its guidance of $711 million for the period. 

 IBM profit

 IBM has posted a 12 per cent jump in quarterly profit and raised its 2007 earnings forecast as revenue surged on acquisitions of software companies. 

 IBM shares, which hit a five-year high this week, rose 3.3 per cent to $114.72 in after-hours trading following the earnings report, which beat analysts forecasts. IBM increased its forecast for earnings-per-share growth in 2007 to 14-15 per cent from a previous forecast of 13-14 per cent.

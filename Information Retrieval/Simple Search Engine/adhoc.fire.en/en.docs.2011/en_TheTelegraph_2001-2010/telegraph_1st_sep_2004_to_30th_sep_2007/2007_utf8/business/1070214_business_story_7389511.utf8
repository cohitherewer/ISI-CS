 Deora rules out fuel price reduction

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: Petroleum minister Murli Deora today said there was no move at the moment either to reduce petrol and diesel prices or to increase them as international crude prices were rising again.

 The minister confirmed that he had written to the Prime Minister and the finance minister for a Re 1 cut in the excise duty on diesel. However, while the finance minister is considering our demand, he also has to take into account the fiscal deficit, Deora added.

 Petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan said high global crude prices had seen duty from diesel sales rise to 22 per cent of the countrys total excise revenues from 16 per cent.

 Bringing down the prices of diesel is in the overall interest of the economy, Srinivasan said.

 The average price of the Indian basket of crude imports, which had come down to $51 per barrel in the first fortnight of January, has shot past $56 per barrel during February.

 According to senior officials, oil companies are suffering a loss of 30 to 35 paise per litre and the profit of petrol has come down from Rs 3.50 to Rs 2 per litre. 

 The petroleum ministry feels that if the price of diesel is to be reduced, it should come through a cut in excise duty.

 According to senior officials, while there is no economic rationale for reducing diesel prices in view of the hardening of international prices, it could be done for political reasons. 

 The government could then compensate the oil companies through the issue of more interest bearing oil bonds.

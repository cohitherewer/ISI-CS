 HDFC Bank ready to shop for funds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 17: The HDFC Bank will issue additional shares to raise $1 billion or Rs 4,200 crore. A third of this amount, around Rs 1,390 crore, will be mopped up by offering preference shares to promoters.

 As the proposed equity issue will reduce promoter HDFC groups shareholding of 21.56 per cent, 1.35 crore shares would be allocated to them on a preferential basis at an issue price of Rs 1,023.49 per share, a company spokesperson said. 

 The issue price is slightly lower than the stocks closing rate on the Bombay Stock Exchange today. The shares ended at Rs 1,036.25, up 0.23 per cent over the previous close of Rs 1033.90. 

 The price has been determined keeping Sebis guidelines in mind. The preferential allotment will have to be made within 15 days of shareholders approving it at the annual general a meeting on June 17.

 The bank plans to raise the balance amount (Rs 2,810 crore) either through a domestic public issue or public or private offerings in one or more international markets. We have kept all options open, the spokesperson said.

 The banks plans come close on the heels of its rival ICICI Banks decision to mop up over Rs 20,000 crore.

 The banks primary objective in raising this capital is to sustain its growth, which has been around 25-30 per cent per annum. Besides, with Basel II around the corner, we want to ensure that we adhere to its norms comfortably, the spokesperson said.

 The increased capital will help the bank meet the new capital market exposure norms, he added.

 The HDFC Bank board has also cleared a proposal to seek shareholders approval to grant 1.5 crore stock options to employees of the bank.

 A merger of HDFC Bank and its parent, the Housing Development Finance Corporation, has been speculated over the past couple of years. HDFC Bank managing director Aditya Puri recently told a television channel that if the Reserve Bank of India does away with the floor on the statutory liquidity ratio, it would speed up the merger process.

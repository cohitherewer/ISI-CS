 Drug duo closer to deal

 Growth pill

 Paris/London, Jan. 29 (Reuters): Sanofi-aventis and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co could announce a merger deal within the next few weeks to create the worlds biggest drug company, according to a report on Monday. 

 In an unsourced story, French financial newsletter La Lettre de Expansion said a pre-merger deal was thought to have been signed last week. 

 Buying Bristol-Myers would be a coup for Sanofis ambitious chairman and veteran dealmaker, Jean-Francois Dehecq, who is due to retire from the French firm at the end of 2009. 

 The acquisition of the US company which has a market value of around $51.5 billion would see Sanofi leapfrog Pfizer Inc as the biggest pharmaceuticals company in the world by sales and push GlaxoSmithKline plc back into third place. 

 Sanofi and Bristol-Myers have long been tipped as possible merger partners, since they worked together in marketing the successful blood thinner Plavix, as well as Avapro for hypertension. 

 A Sanofi spokesman said the company did not comment on press speculation. Still, many analysts and industry executives are convinced that Sanofi has taken a long, hard look at US-based Bristol-Myers in recent months. 

 This wouldnt surprise me. Sanofi needs increased exposure to the US. They have substantially de-leveraged their balance sheet since they took over Aventis, so they are prone to do something going forward, WestLB analyst Oliver Kaemmerer said. Any bid could be a mixture of cash and shares, he said. 

 Novartis chairman and chief executive Daniel Vasella said last month he believed such a deal could be on the cards. I would not be surprised if companies, which are connected via products like Sanofi-aventis and Bristol-Myers Squibb think about a merger, Vasella told a Swiss newspaper. 

 Sanofi, with a market capitalisation of 95 billion euros ($123 billion), is twice the size of Bristol-Myers, but its shares are less highly rated.

 Calcutta, June 23: Bharat Earth Movers has introduced lubricating oils for engines and hydraulic and transmission systems of mining and construction equipment as part of its diversification plan.

 The oils will be blended by Silivassa-based Nandan Petrochemicals and sold under the brand name Beml Oil, chairman and managing director V.R.S. Natarajan said.

 The company expects to earn a revenue of Rs 100 crore from the business in the next three years. We have over 20,000 equipment at various locations. The demand for lubricating oil is estimated at Rs 300-350 crore, he said. 

 BEML is banking on Coal India, its biggest customer for mining, earth removing and other equipment. 

 In 2006-07, we bought 4,12,000 kilolitres of lubricating oil for Rs 1,500 crore, said Partha S. Bhattacharya, chairman and managing director of Coal India. If BEML can supply 20 per cent of our demand, it means big business for them, he added. 

 BEML is targeting a turnover of Rs 5,000 crore by 2013-14. The company reported sales of Rs 2,600 crore last fiscal. It has earmarked Rs 900 crore over the next three years on diversification and expansion.

 We have already invested Rs 200 crore. We are coming out with a second public offering in four days to mobilise Rs 450 crore, Natarajan said.

 The company will spend Rs 214 crore to set up a plant for metro rail coaches. It makes about 200 units per year at its Bangalore facility.

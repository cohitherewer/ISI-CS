The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 SAIL possessive about Chiria ore

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Roongta: Looking for more

 Calcutta, March 15: The Steel Authority of India (SAIL) wants the entire reserves of Chiria iron ore mines in Jharkhand for itself. 

 The company said it would require the entire 2 billion tonnes of high-quality reserves, one of the largest in Asia. 

 We want to secure iron ore requirement for our plants for the next 50 years. According to our estimates, the requirement is 2 billion tonnes, SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta said.

 In return, the company is willing to set up a greenfield plant in Jharkhand. SAIL expects this proposal to end the impasse with the state.

 SAILs stand is, however, different from that of steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan, who had proposed a two-way split for Chiria. According to Paswan, Chiria has reserves of 3 billion tonnes, of which 2 billion tonnes would be kept for SAIL, while the remaining 1 billion tonnes would be left for private players.

 Many companies, including Mittal Steel and Tata Steel, are believed to be eyeing this deposit. Jharkhand has disputed four out of the 10 leases SAIL has in Chiria.

 According to Roongta, the proven reserves of Chiria are 2 billion tonnes. Roongta said there could be more deposits outside the leasehold area of SAIL in Chiria and Jharkhand has the liberty to give that to private parties.

 Roongta said a meeting on this issue will be scheduled shortly. SAIL is expanding its Bokaro plant in Jharkhand as part of its brownfield expansion plan and considering a greenfield unit with an initial capacity of 6 million tonnes.

 Roongta is happy that the Jharkhand government has given priority to SAILs need for iron ore.

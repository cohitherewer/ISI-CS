 Bank cash transaction tax set for overhaul

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Budget 2007-08 

 New Delhi, Feb. 24: The government is considering a proposal to relax norms on paying banking cash transaction tax (BCTT). The 0.01 per cent tax was introduced by the Congress government two years back to track down evaders. 

 Despite pressures from allies and state governments, the Congress government has decided to continue with the tax. It may, however, consider some concessions. 

 The government may allow state governments to withdraw money for cash wage payments without paying the tax. Several states have expressed their difficulties on large cash wage payouts. Another move being mulled is to increase the floor level for paying the tax. 

 The government charges a transaction tax on cash withdrawals of more than Rs 25,000 by individuals and more than Rs 1 lakh by corporates. 

 Banks had said it was becoming cumbersome to deduct tax on every withdrawal of Rs 25,000 and this could be easily avoided by withdrawing in smaller lots. 

 Officials said these proposals had come up in the meetings of the finance ministry mandarins in the run-up to the budget. Which of these proposals will be finally accepted or rejected is of course a political decision, they added. 

 Officials said though it had yielded small amounts as a tax, it had turned out to be an effective way of checking tax evasion. 

 A case in which wholesalers in Delhis Sadar Bazar had withdrawn cash of up to 150 crore using BCTT had also been detected.

 Besides, BCTT, the government currently uses seven other kinds of transactions which have to be reported to the tax authorities to keep tabs on high value spending. These include cash deposits of over Rs 10 lakh a year in a bank and credit card payments of up to Rs 2 lakh.

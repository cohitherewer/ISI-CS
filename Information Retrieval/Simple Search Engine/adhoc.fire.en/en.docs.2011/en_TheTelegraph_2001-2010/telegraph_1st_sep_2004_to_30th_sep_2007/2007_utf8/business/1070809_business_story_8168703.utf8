 New Delhi, Aug. 8: The Apollo Hospitals group and Germany-based DKV AG today launched Apollo DKV Insurance Company. 

 We expect to cover one million lives in the next two to three years, said Jochen Messemer, director of Apollo DKV.

 Apollo Hospitals will hold a 74 per cent stake and DKV AG 26 per cent in the new venture. The duo have invested Rs 108 crore in the company.

 Apollo DKV Insurance is likely to roll out products from the middle of September. 

 It plans to offer cashless products and services in over 4,000 hospitals across the country. The other hospitals will be covered on a reimbursement basis.

 Pricing will be risk-adequate and on a par with other players. Our products, however, will have value-added services and will give value for money, said Shobana Kamineni, director, Apollo Hospitals. 

 Apollo DKV will start with six regional offices in major cities. In the second year of its operations, it will expand to 25 cities and by 2010, to over 100 cities.

 The joint venture initially proposes to offer a comprehensive range of products in patient hospitalisation, critical illness, overseas travel and health cover and personal accidents. 

 The company will operate as a stand-alone health insurer. It plans to offer innovative health insurance solutions, covering the entire healthcare spectrum.

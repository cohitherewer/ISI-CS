 Calcutta, July 24: The United Bank of India (UBI) has reported a 25.4 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 88.21 crore for the quarter ended June 30 compared with Rs 70.35 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

 The higher earning came on the back of a 38.9 per cent year-on-year growth in advances at Rs 22,732 crore. The banks retail lending grew 98 per cent to Rs 5,770 crore.

 UBIs gross non-performing assets (NPA) were at 3.60 per cent of its gross advances as on March 31, 2007. By June-end, the banks gross NPA stood at 3.87 per cent against 4.64 per cent in the year-ago period.

 The net NPA as a percentage of net advances also inched up to 1.57 per cent at the end of the first quarter from 1.50 per cent in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. 

 During the first three months of the current fiscal, UBI increased its loan portfolio by Rs 89 crore to Rs 22,732 crore from Rs 22,643 crore as on March 31, 2007. It added Rs 1,213 crore to its total deposits, which stood at Rs 38,380 crore.

 The bank also raised Rs 575 crore through upper tier-II bonds to push up its capital adequacy ratio to 13 per cent. 

 The bank posted a healthy growth in both its interest income and fee-based income because of the rise in interest rates. UBIs interest income in the first quarter of the current fiscal was up 28.2 per cent at Rs 839.76 crore from Rs 655.24 crore the previous corresponding quarter and the non-interest income rose 34.8 per cent to Rs 78.83 crore from Rs 58.47 crore in the year-ago period.

 We opened 25 new branches during the three months and will open 60 more branches before September this year, said P.K. Gupta, chairman and managing director of UBI.

 Vodafone dials DoT number

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: British telecom company Vodafones top representatives Mathew Kirk and Neil Gough met senior officials of the department of telecom (DoT) today to discuss FDI norms in the telecom sector. 

 Sources said the meeting assumed significance in the backdrop of Vodafones intention to acquire Hutch Essar, the countrys fourth-largest mobile operator.

 A senior DoT official said the meeting discussed the latest position on the implementation of FDI norms in the telecom sector, but denied any discussions on issues relating to Hutch Essar bid.

 Senior Vodafone officials met telecom secretary Dinesh Mathur and made a presentation about the companys plans in the country, the DoT official said. The topic of Hutch Essar buyout was not even touched upon. They enquired about the recently-announced vision statement of the ministry and wanted to know the strategy for implementation of revised FDI norms, he added.

 Neither the Vodafone spokesperson nor DoT secretary D. S. Mathur were available for comments. However, sources pointed out that the discussions were important as any foreign buyer interested in Hutch Essar would like to know exactly how the government will be implementing its FDI norms in telecom and whether the new guidelines, which are yet to be notified, will affect the way they wish to take over the company. 

 The British telecom firm is one of the front-runners for Hutch Essar, which is 67 per cent owned by Hong Kongs Hutchison Telecommunications International. 

 The remaining 33 per cent is controlled by Essar, a steel-to-shipping group controlled by the Ruia family, which itself is reported to be willing to buy some or all of the firm. 

 Hutchison, which has 22 million subscribers, has said it has received proposals for its stake but has not given details.

 Vodafone has valued the company at $17 billion, a shade larger than the amount mooted by Essar to buy the 67 per cent stake in the operator.

 The proposed deal could see Vodafone, the worlds largest mobile operator by revenue, emerge as the majority shareholder.

 But according to the law, foreign shareholdings in telecom firms cannot exceed 74 per cent, limiting Vodafone to 52 per cent with Essars foreign subsidiary controlling another 22 per cent.

 The government has postponed the implementation of the revised FDI guidelines till April 2, 2007 to reach a consensus with intelligence agencies on the crucial remote access issue 

 Vodafone is keen to know the latest position of the government on foreign investment, said a DoT official. 

 While foreign investment levels were raised from 49 per cent to 74 per cent in November last year, and a press note to this effect issued, conflicting interests within the government has deferred implementation of the policy, now for the fourth time.

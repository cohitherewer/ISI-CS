 ACC net leaps to Rs 358 cr 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 1: Associated Cement Companies (ACC) has posted a 107 per cent rise in net profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2006. 

 Following higher realisations and jump in volumes, net profit on a stand-alone basis shot up to Rs 358.46 crore for the October-December quarter from Rs 173.45 crore in the corresponding period last year. 

 ACC said sales turnover during the period was at Rs 1,619.90 crore, up 50 per cent from Rs 1,078.37 crore last year. The company added that it sold 18.86 million tonnes (mt) of cement compared with 17.50 mt during 2005 (January-December), an increase of 7.8 per cent. 

 Turnover was up 28.2 per cent at Rs 5,851.24 crore during the year compared with Rs 4,563.57 crore during 2005. Improved realisation and volume as partially offset by increase in cost of inputs has resulted in higher profit, ACC said. 

 Commenting on its furure projects, ACC revealed that augmentation of grinding capacities at Kymore, Tikaria, Sindri and Wadi is in progress. 

 Accordingly, the company will add 3.19 mt capacity to touch 23.10 mt by December 2007. 

 Further, the Bargarh expansion of capacity by 1.18 mt is also progressing according to schedule. 

 According to ACC, the cement industry recorded a healthy growth rate of about 11.3 per cent during 2006 compared to 9.4 per cent for the previous period.

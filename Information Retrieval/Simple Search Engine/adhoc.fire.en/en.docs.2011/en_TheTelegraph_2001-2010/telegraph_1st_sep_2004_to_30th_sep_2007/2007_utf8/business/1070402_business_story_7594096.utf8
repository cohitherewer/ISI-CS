 Keep it simple

 Hong Kong, April 1: Philips Electronics sees India as an important market for the launch of its innovative product portfolio with its brand promise of simplicity. 

 The company revealed some of its design explorations as part of the 2007 Philips Simplicity event in Hong Kong. The concepts demonstrate the companys vision to offer simplicity-led designs. 

 A greater part of our approach to simplicity concepts originates from Asia and countries such as India. Be it power-saving devices or space constraints, the needs of different communities in emerging markets fuel our design formulations, said Andrea Ragnetti, chair, Simplicity Advisory Board, and chief executive officer of Philips Domestic Appliances and Personal Care. A large number of the companys Asian designers are from India.

 The Hong Kong Simplicity concept collection was grouped into five sub-themes that contribute directly and indirectly to a healthy lifestyle listen to your body, care for your body, move your body, relax your mind and share experiences.

 The Today range showcased products such as the wood stove, which is being piloted among 450 families in India, or the water purification lamp which irradiates water with a powerful ultraviolet lamp. It works instantly, leaving no residues and does not require any dangerous chemicals.

 Products like the wood stove, which reduces fuel consumption by 80 per cent and smoke pollution by 90 per cent and the UV lamp water purifier show our commitment to deliver the simplicity concept in emerging markets, Ragnetti added.

 Other concepts that were exhibited included the interactive digital family album to help share pictures around the world without a computer, the interactive, touch-sensitive digital mirror, In Touch, which acts as the family message board, or the music spectrum, which can create musical moods from a whole range of feelings with the slide of a finger.

 All these concepts have the potential to be developed into products. Though futuristic, we have kept a timeframe of three to four years. That is the future for us to deliver these concepts to our customers in a product form within a finite timeframe. India will be part of our launch plan and the gap between introducing these products in developed and developing economies have been cut down drastically, said Rudy Provost, CEO, consumer electronics division, Philips.

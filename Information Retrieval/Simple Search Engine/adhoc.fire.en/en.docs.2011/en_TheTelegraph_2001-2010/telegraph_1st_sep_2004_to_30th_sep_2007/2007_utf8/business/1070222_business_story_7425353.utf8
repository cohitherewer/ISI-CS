 Licence prop for British Telecom

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: The department of telecommunication today granted international and national long distance licences to British Telecom (BT).

 These licences would enable BTs newly formed joint venture company, BT Telecom India Private Limited, to offer data and managed services for the first time directly to multi-site corporate customers in India.

 We plan to start the services in the next six weeks. Our focus will be foreign multinational software and BPO houses, banks and financial services firms which have multi-sites geographically and Indian companies with global operations, said C.S. Rao, managing director, BT India.

 The licence gives us the flexibility to offer all Internet protocol services directly to companies which need high quality bandwidth provisioning, added Rao. 

 BT plans to provide corporate customers who have sites in the country with virtual private network-based (VPN) services using technologies such as Internet protocol-based multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) and ATM.

 Industry analysts said having its own network will help reduce BTs cost of operations.

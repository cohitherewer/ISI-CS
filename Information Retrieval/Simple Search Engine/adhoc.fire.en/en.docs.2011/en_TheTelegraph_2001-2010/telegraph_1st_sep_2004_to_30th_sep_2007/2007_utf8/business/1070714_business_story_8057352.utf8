 High tide for deep-sea port

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 13: Shipping ministry secretary A.K. Mahapatra today met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the office of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation to brief him on the appointment of a consultancy firm for the proposed deep-sea port in Bengal.

 Bengal commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen later said the Centre had already shortlisted seven consultancy firms. Of the seven, one will be appointed within 90 days to conduct the feasibility study, said Sen. Bhattacharjee had earlier met Prime Minister Manmohan Sigh to discuss the issue. 

 However, state commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen ruled out the possibility of setting up the port at Sagar Island. It was widely felt that the port would come up at Sagar.

 Bengal has a 200km of coastal stretch, of which we are intentionally keeping the Sunderbans biosphere out of the purview so that the forest area is not disturbed, Sen said.

 Bengal has been lobbying for a deep-sea port as big ships are unable to call on Calcutta and Haldia ports because of shallow water. The Centre has agreed in-principle to Bengals plea to allow a feasibility study that may take at least 18 months to conclude.

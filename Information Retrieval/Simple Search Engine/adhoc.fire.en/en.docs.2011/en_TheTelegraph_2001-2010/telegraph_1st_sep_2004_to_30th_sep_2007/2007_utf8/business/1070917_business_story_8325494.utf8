 Q amp;A

 Cheque trouble

 I received an a/c payee cheque from ICICI Bank. I went to deposit this cheque in my savings bank account (which is a joint account) in Allahabad Bank. The Allahabad Bank staff wanted payees signature on the reverse of the cheque. Is it mandatory?

 Rinku Gayen, Sheoraphuli

 No, it is not mandatory even if it is a non-a/c payee cheque. A signature on the reverse of a cheque is required only when one wants to withdraw money.

 For women only

 I want to invest in an insurance scheme for my daughter. Suggest some good insurance schemes.

 Suchitra Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Insurers at present do not offer policies exclusively for women. You can buy a traditional product or a unit-linked one. In traditional products, the insurer bears the investment risk of the fund, while the onus is on the policyholder in unit-linked plans. 

 Depending on your risk taking ability, you should choose between the two. Once this choice is made, you will have to decide what kind of protection you want endowment, money back, whole life along with various riders available. Compare the premium cost of different insurers for the same kind of product as well as the premium cost for different insurance plans of each company. Insurance companies provide premium calculator on their respective websites. This will give you a fair idea as to which policy to buy.

 Tax liability

 I am a senior citizen. My total annual income is over Rs 1.95 lakh. But my taxable income is much below the threshold limit because I have a sizeable income from mutual funds (which is tax-free). Is it mandatory to submit income tax return?

 Amitabh Pal, Calcutta

 Though a sizeable part of your total annual income comes tax-free from mutual fund investments, you will have to file income tax return because your income is more than the threshold limit of Rs 1.95 lakh. However, you can show a nil tax liability in the income tax return.

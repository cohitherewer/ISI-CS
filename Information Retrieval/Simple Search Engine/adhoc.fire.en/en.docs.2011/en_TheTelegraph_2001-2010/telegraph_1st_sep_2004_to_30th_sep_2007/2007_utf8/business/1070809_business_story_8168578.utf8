The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Forex earnings from tourism up 20%

 GARIMA SINGH NEOGY

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: An average foreign tourist in India is spending far more now than he/she did last year. In the first seven months of this year, about 2.7 million tourists visited India and spent $4.2 billion. In the year-ago period, 2.4 million tourists visited the country and spent about $3.5 billion.

 This represents an increase of about 12 per cent in arrivals and over 20 per cent in forex earnings, with an average tourist spending $1,555 on a holiday or business trip to India this year.

 Tarun Thukral, chief operating officer of Le Meridien, said, In real terms, high-end business travel has gone up considerably. As a result, spending on conferences, functions and seminars too has seen a jump. 

 With hotels in short supply, tourists are spending more on a room. Thukral said, An increase in room rates is reflected in the high foreign exchange earnings by hotels. The average room rate increased 30 per cent between January and March and 20 per cent between April and July across the country.

 In India, the period between October and March is considered peak season for tourists.

 A senior Indian Hotels executive said, The hotel trade has made large investments to renovate and upgrade properties. As a result, India is attracting tourists with high disposable incomes. Moreover, new products and services by hoteliers have encouraged the inflow of tourists to India. 

 With the Centre aggressively pushing medical tourism by highlighting cost advantages, this segment has been growing at the rate of 25 per cent a year. 

 Analysts estimate medical tourism can fetch the country $2 billion a year in the next five years.

 LIC gets ready to take more risk

 ANIRUDH LASKAR

 Vijayan: Looking ahead

 Mumbai, July 23: The Life Insurance Corporation is preparing to enter the credit card and health insurance businesses ventures that carry a larger element of risk. 

 Indias largest life insurer plans to set up a non-banking financial company (NBFC) next month in a partnership with a banking group or a financial house.

 The LICs credit cards will hit the market by October or November this year. We will tie up with a bank or a financial institution to form a separate NBFC to look after our credit card business, LIC chairman T.S. Vijayan told The Telegraph.

 Vijayan said Hemant Bhargava would be appointed executive director for credit card operations. Bhargava has created two separate teams based in Mumbai and Delhi to look after the business.

 We plan to enter the credit card segment to facilitate our ongoing operations. The key is to bring down transaction costs. If you want to reduce costs, plastic and network are the answers, and credit cards will bring that advantage. I believe that the credit card business will establish a good synergy with our current business processes, Vijayan added.

 Speculation has swirled that the LIC will tie up with GE for its credit card operations. We read those articles that have speculated about our tie up with GE. But frankly, we have not yet shortlisted any company as of now. We are in talks with some banks and financial institutions to start our credit card business, but it would be too early to announce any name right now, he said.

 The company has appointed KPMG as its adviser for the credit card venture. KPMG will also help decide a partner for the NBFC. The company said it would formally announce the name of the NBFC partner in the second week of August. 

 LIC is the first company in India to introduce credit cards. If the venture succeeds, other players may also begin to think on similar lines. Although the structure of the NBFC is not very clear, officials at LIC are gung-ho about the venture. 

 LIC has also set up a separate department for health insurance. D. D. Singh has been appointed the executive director for its health insurance operations. 

 Our first health insurance policy will be available in September. We have not yet priced the health products, but we may not see too much premium generating from the segment in the first year, Vijayan added. The insurance company has set a total business premium target of close to Rs 155,000 crore for 2007-08, which is about 24 per cent higher than the Rs 125,000 crore in the year-ago period.

 The company expects to garner Rs 52,500 crore as new business premium this fiscal. Our unit-linked insurance products are performing well and have contributed about 70 per cent to our new business premium. We believe the trend will continue this year as well, Vijayan said.

 Stocks stage a pullback

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 3: The sensex today shot up by 169 points on short covering and buying by FIIs to recoup some of its losses of yesterday when it plunged by 617 points.

 The rally was led by key heavyweights and infotech shares though gains eluded several mid-cap and small-cap scrips. A few banks also were seen ending in the green. 

 Equities got hammered yesterday following the Reserve Bank of India raising the cash reserve ratio (CRR) and repo rate last Friday. Shares of sectors sensitive to changes in the interest rate such as banks, real estate and auto were the worst hit though the fall later spread to other counters. 

 Analysts said todays bounce-back indicated that the market may have over-reacted to the RBIs measures. However, many analysts are unsure about the sustainability of the gains, and much will depend on the results of Infosys on April 13.

 The extent of the fall has been overdone. The fall was largely contributed by RBIs series of CRR and repo rate hikes, and the consequent decrease in foreign investments. The market still looks bullish in the long run and will see an upward movement from the month of August. says Manish Sonthalia, vice president, market strategist at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. 

 Sonthalia expects the inflation rate, which has unnerved the markets for quite some time will come down from the second week of April. 

 The second half of the financial year is going to see a sustained ascent only, he added. However, an analyst with a foreign brokerage expected sentiments to be subdued in the short-run with bouts of relief rally. The sentiment will only improve after the interest rate tightening phase comes to an end and the rate of inflation comes down, he pointed out. 

 The 30-share BSE sensex opened firm at 12503.75 and gradually moved upwards to the intra-day high of 12657.75 before closing at 12624.58, a net rise of 169.21 points, or 1.36 per cent over yesterdays close of 12,455.37. 

 Similarly, S amp;P CNX Nifty of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) shot up by 57.05 points, or 1.57 per cent, to close at 3690.65 from the previous close of 3633.60. 

 Some of the key gainers were Reliance Industries, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services and Tata Motors. 

 While foreign institutional investors were believed to have made good purchases in some of the frontline counters, market circles said that operators were covering short positions after the panic selling of yesterday.

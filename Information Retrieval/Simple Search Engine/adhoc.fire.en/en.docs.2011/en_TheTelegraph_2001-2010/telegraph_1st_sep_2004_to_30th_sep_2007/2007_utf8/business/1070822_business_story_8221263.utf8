 FIRM FOOTING

 Mumbai, Aug. 21: JSW Steel, the steel manufacturing arm of OP Jindal Group, has acquired three US-based steel pipes and plate manufacturing companies for $810 million.

 The steel maker named the target companies as Jindal United Steel Corporation, Saw Pipes, USA and Jindal Enterprises LLC. Prithviraj Jindal-run Jindal SAW Ltd holds stakes of 49 per cent, 19.4 per cent and 100 per cent, respectively, in the three entities.

 The three companies will be merged into a single entity whose enterprise value is estimated at $900 million. JSW Steel will then have a 90 per cent stake in the target company. Some of the existing shareholders will retain the remaining 10 per cent. The company said the acquisition would give JSW a strong foothold in the booming oil and gas sector in North America, which is driving up the plate and pipe demand. 

 The total acquisition price works out to 6.25 times of the EBIDTA of the target companies. However, the deal fits perfectly into our long-term investment strategy. The slabs manufactured at our Vijaynagar plant would be exported to the US where we would add value before selling the final product to energy generation companies at a much higher margin, said Sajjan Jindal, vice-chairman and managing director of JSW Steel.

 The company will stump up $940 million to buy out the firms and provide immediate working capital. It will pay $810 million for the 90 per cent stake and another $130 million as the cost of inventory. The deal will be financed through a foreign currency debt of $380 million that will be guaranteed by JSW Steel. The remaining $560 million will be raised by the target company. 

 Seshagiri Rao, director (finance) of JSW Steel, said the company would spend an additional $60 million to upgrade and modernise the plate, pipe and coating mills.

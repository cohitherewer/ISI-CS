 Chennai, June 14: Tata Sons chairman Ratan Tata feels there are better ways to social justice than through job quotas in the private sector.

 We want to create an India of equal opportunities for all rather than talk of reservation (in the private sector), Tata said after inaugurating a two-day summit on corporate social responsibility organised by the CII.

 Tata said his group was working with the CII for many years to create a land of equal opportunities before the reservation issue cropped up.

 On Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs recent plea that companies cap salaries of top executives, he said, The Tatas groups salaries have never been extravagant.

 Tata is also upbeat about the groups growing telecom business. 

 The group is focusing on providing end-to-end solutions, he added. 

 We have started with the CDMA technology. When 3G technology comes in we will be interested in it too. On the merger process of Anglo-Dutch steel maker Corus, Tata said, We are pleased with the way the integration is going on.

 He denied that the group had exited the oil exploration business. Tata, however, said his group was keen on acquisitions in the beverages.

 Venu Srinivasan, managing director of Sundram Clyton, who set the tone for the summit at the inaugural session, appealed to all present to make corporate social responsibility a business agenda. 

 Executives from leading companies such as Pradipta K. Mohapatra, president and CEO (technology business sector) of RPG Enterprises, are participating in this summit.

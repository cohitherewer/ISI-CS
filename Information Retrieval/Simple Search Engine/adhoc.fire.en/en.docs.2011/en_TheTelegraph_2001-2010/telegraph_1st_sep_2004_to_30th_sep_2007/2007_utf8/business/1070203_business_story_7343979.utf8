 Windfall for CEO, staff

 London, Feb. 2 (PTI): Shareholding employees of Corus, led by its chief executive Philip Varin, are set to reap riches when the companys shareholders approve Tata Steels takeover bid on March 7.

 Varin would be pocketing 10 million from the combination of shares and options held directly by him, UK daily The Guardian said.

 Varin is understood to have taken part of his bonus payments in Corus shares as well as investing his own money in the company.

 Many of the companys workforce would get a great opportunity to make money, as a result of the bid, according to ifsProShare, a not-for-profit organisation which encourages employee share ownership.

 The organisation said yesterday that at least 7,000 Corus Steel workers would get payouts averaging more than 6,000 each as a result of membership of the Corus Sharesave scheme, which enabled employees to buy up to 150 worth of shares each month at a discount.

 The year 2007 will see an increasing number of companies and employees benefit from such schemes and we hope this will act as an incentive for other companies to offer their employees a stake in their organisation, Fiona Downes, ifsProShares head of employee share ownership, said.

 Under Varins stewardship, Corus shares have climbed from the equivalent of 40 pence when he took over in 2003 to just over 6 and investors who bought in the rights issue later that year are sitting on handsome profits.

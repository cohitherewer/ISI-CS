 Rejig in power reform programme

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 31: The Union power ministry is revising its Accelerated Power Development Reform Programme a scheme that gives incentives to state power utilities to reduce their transmission and distribution (T amp;D) losses.

 Under the revised programme, which will take effect this financial year, the loans given to a utility wont be converted into a grant-in-aid if it fails to bring down its T amp;D losses to at least 15 per cent within five years.

 A base line data of consumers will be prepared and energy metering and energy audit made compulsory, Union power secretary Anil Razdan said at the Northeast Powermart 2007 organised by the eastern regional council of the CII here today.

 If a utility cannot bring down the transmission and distribution loss within 15 per cent in five years, the grant component from the government will be treated as loan. This was a major change that was proposed, Razdan said.

 Under the current norm, the Centre treats 25 per cent of the programme cost to state utilities as grant and 75 per cent as loan. 

 DVC project

 Reliance Energy is set to bag a Rs 4,000-crore contract to set up a 1,000mw power plant for Damodar Valley Corporation at Raghunathpur in Purulia.

 The Anil Ambani group company was the sole bidder for the engineering, procurement and construction contract for the proposed power project, according to a senior DVC official. 

 NHPC investment 

 The National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) plans to invest Rs 67,000 crore to develop power projects in the Northeast. The company has already approved an investment of Rs 27,000 crore in three hydel power projects in Arunachal Pradesh. It plans to invest Rs 23,000 crore in two more projects in the state. 

 Countrywide, 13 projects are under construction and 17 are in the pipeline. All these projects will have a generation capacity of 15,000mw to 16,000mw by 2017, said Digvijay Nath, executive director, NHPC.

 We are in talks with the Bengal government for a pilot tidal power project at the Sunderban area, he said.

 Calcutta, May 16: Godrej Consumer Products Limited is eyeing acquisitions in West Asia and South America.

 The company has appointed merchant bankers to find target companies in these regions. In 2006-07, the company reported net sales of Rs 953 crore, of which 35 per cent came from dyes.

 Godrej hair dyes rank first in sales in the world Since we are strong in powder dye, we are looking for opportunities primarily in this area, H.K. Press, executive director and president, Godrej Consumer, said.

 According to Press, the company is interested in markets where consumers have dark hair. West Asia is a preferred location followed by South America and Africa. 

 Press said the company would face no problem in mobilising funds for the acquisition. The overseas focus in dyes comes when the companys domestic business is growing at a rate less than the all-India growth rate.

 While the Rs 500-crore Indian hair dye industry grew at around 21.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2006-07, the companys business in the segment grew at 11 per cent.

 The market share of the company fell to 36.2 per cent in the quarter from 38 per cent in the third quarter. The company last year acquired the South African business of the UK-based Rapidol as well as its subsidiary Rapidol International.

 The acquisition gave the company rights to the Inecto brand in 10 countries. Inecto had a 80 per cent share of the ethnic hair colour market in South Africa. 

 Press said the Rapidol acquisition gave Godrej an opportunity to launch its Indian brands in Africa.

 Godrej also acquired UKs Keyline Brands in 2005. The acquisition gave Godrej ownership over several brands and trademarks such as Cuticura, Erasmic and Nulon in many countries.

 There are a lot of Keyline brands in segments such as skin creams and hand washes. Our next Keyline launch will be the unisex skin cream range, Aapri, Press said. He said the company was also interested in acquisitions in other segments of personal care such as soaps.

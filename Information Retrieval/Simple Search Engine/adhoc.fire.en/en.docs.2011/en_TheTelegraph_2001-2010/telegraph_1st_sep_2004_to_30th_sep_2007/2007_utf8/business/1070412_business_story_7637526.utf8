 New Delhi, April 11: Commerce minister Kamal Nath today said he was hopeful of a free trade agreement with Thailand by early July. The pact is expected to double bilateral trade to $10 billion by 2010.

 We are looking at the end of June, Nath said after a meeting with his Thai counterpart, Krikkrai Jirapaet. There are sensitivities of both the countries that need to be adequately addressed, he said. 

 Trade officials of the two countries met here today to review progress on the agreement. The meeting was the first since the coup in Thailand in September last year.

 Indias commerce secretary Gopal Pillai said the value of trade between the two countries had increased 20 per cent in four years and was expected to total $4 billion this year.

 However, there are concerns over a rising trade gap with Thailand since export growth at 20 per cent is far below the import growth of 39 per cent.

 The countries already have a framework agreement since 2003, which has fixed zero duties on 84 items of trade under an early harvest scheme. 

 However a broader free trade pact, with zero duty on more products and less curbs on investments, has been delayed due to resistance from sections of the Indian industry and the change in the regime in Bangkok.

 The rubber industry has opposed the pact as it fears a glut of cheap rubber from Thailand. Similar fears have been raised by plastic makers and some segments of the electronic components industry such as picture tubes for television. 

 Pillai said the negotiations were over the number of items with zero duties, with Thailand demanding more than Indias offer of zero duty on 80 per cent of the 5,200 tariff lines.

 WTO talks 

 Trade ministers of the G4 group of nations Brazil, the EU, the US and India met here to kickstart the stalled Doha discussions of the WTO. 

 The ministers had bilateral discussions today, and all of them will be engaged in a roundtable tomorrow the first since the talks broke down in July 2006, over differences in farm subsidies and industrial tariffs. 

 EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson said he has come to the talks with an open mind.

 Always positive, always on the front foot. Always showing flexibility, and I will do my best to sustain that position on the European Unions behalf, Mandelson told journalists.

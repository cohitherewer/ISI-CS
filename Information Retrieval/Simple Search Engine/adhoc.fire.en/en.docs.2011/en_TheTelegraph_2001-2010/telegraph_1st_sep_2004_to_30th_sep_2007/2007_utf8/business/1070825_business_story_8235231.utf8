 Mittal: Big plans

 New Delhi, Aug. 24: The LN Mittal group is exploring the possibility of picking up a stake in Hindustan Petroleums proposed refinery and petrochem complex in Visakhapatnam. If it fructifies, this will be Mittal groups second equity investment in the countrys oil sector.

 The group has already picked up a 49 per cent stake in HPCLs refinery at Bhatinda in Punjab.

 Mittal Energy Investments will be the company which intends to pick up a substantial equity in the Rs 30,000-crore Vizag refinery complex. Besides Mittal, Oil India, Frances Total and GAIL (India) Ltd are slated to pick up stakes in the complex, which is the second project of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) in Visakhapatnam. 

 Spread over 1,500 acres, the HPCL complex is one of five-six petrochemical hubs coming up in coastal states. Similar hubs will also be set up in Haldia and Jamnagar among other regions. 

 HPCL operates a refinery at Visakhapatnam, with an installed capacity of 150,000 barrels per day, to be expanded to 3 lakh barrels by the middle of next year.

 The new petrochem complex will have a capacity of 9 million tonnes per year and the refinery will be a hub for exports to China and Southeast Asian markets.

 Discussions are on among the proposed partners over the equity structure of the project. A single entity is unlikely to hold more than 30 per cent in the project.

 HPCL has a staff strength of about 10,500 and is considered the second largest integrated oil refining and marketing company of the country.

 Mittal has a joint venture with the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) ONGC-Mittal Energy to acquire overseas oil and gas assets. The combine had bagged some exploration blocks in oil-rich Nigeria. Of the 98 per cent equity in ONGC-Mittal Energy Ltd, the PSU holds a 51 per cent stake while Mittal Investments Sarl has 49 per cent. The remaining 2 per cent is with financial institutions.

 The duo have also signed an MoU for joint trading of oil and gas, including LNG. The company, ONGC Mittal Energy Services Ltd, will have a shareholding pattern similar to ONGC-Mittal Energy.

 In the Bhatinda refinery, Mittal will pump in Rs 3,506 crore for his 49 per cent stake. HPCLs stake in the Rs 18,919-crore project is also 49 per cent, while institutions hold the balance 2 per cent.

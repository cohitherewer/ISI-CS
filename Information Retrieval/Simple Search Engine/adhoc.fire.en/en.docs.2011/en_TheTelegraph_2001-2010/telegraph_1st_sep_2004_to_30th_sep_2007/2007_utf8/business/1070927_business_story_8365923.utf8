 Rashtriya Ispat gears up for SEZ

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 26: Visakhapatnam-based Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL) is planning to build a steel special economic zone (SEZ) near its plant.

 The company has approached the Andhra Pradesh government with a proposal for the SEZ. The state government, however, had asked for some clarifications about its proposal, said commercial director C.G. Patil.

 We are working out the details, he said at the Steel Wire Manufacturers Association of Indias annual general meeting in the city today.

 Patil said the company had 25,000 acres, which it got from the state government when the plant was being set up in the late seventies. 

 Apart from the plant, the plot also has a township for the employees and a green belt.

 Land acquisition is the biggest stumbling block towards building SEZs in the country. 

 RINL, therefore, is in a comparatively better position to build an SEZ.

 RINL has a crude steel capacity of 3.6 million tonnes, which is being expanded to 6.3 mt at an estimated investment of Rs 8,700 crore. 

 The company hopes to take the capacity to 8.5 mt by a de-bottlenecking exercise.

 New steel plants, such as JSW Steels in Bengal, are coming up on much smaller plots. 

 JSW Steel will set up a 10mt facility, an integrated township and a captive power plant on 4,800 acres.

 JSWs township will be put up on over 400 acres at Salboni.

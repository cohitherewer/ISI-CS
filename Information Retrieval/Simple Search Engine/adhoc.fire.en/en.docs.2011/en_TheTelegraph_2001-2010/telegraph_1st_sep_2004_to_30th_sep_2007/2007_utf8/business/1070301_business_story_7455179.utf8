 Slew of steps to tame inflation

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: Reacting to the price spiral which has started to hurt it politically, the Congress-led government today banned forward trading in commodities, slashed customs duties on imports and set a differential production tax on cement, to help cool down inflation. 

 The government today announced a ban on futures trading in wheat and rice in all commodity exchanges as it felt the practice was being misused by speculators to rake in a fast buck at the cost of consumers. 

 As part of innovative measures to contain inflation, the finance minister today also introduced a dual excise duty for cement with a concessional rate of Rs 350 per tonne for those selling cement at Rs 190 per bag, while those marketing it at a higher price will have to shell out a heftier Rs 600 per tonne. 

 Cement prices have shot up three-fold over the last two years. An earlier attempt to cool down prices by allowing import of cement at zero duty did not help much.

 Todays slew of measures was seen as policy steps which the government should have taken earlier to curb the inflation rate which has been topping 6.6 per cent for the past few weeks. Excess money with corporates and middle class Indians, easy credit, higher fuel prices and a short supply of food products have led to prices soaring, which has become politically embarrassing for the government. 

 I have always held that there need not be a trade off between growth and inflation. However last years 9.2 per cent growth was however inflation generating, said S.P.Gupta, former member of the planning commission. 

 The budget also cut peak customs duty from 12.5 per cent to 10 per cent, which should impact rise in manufactured goods prices. It also exempted crude as well as refined edible oils from additional countervailing duty of four per cent to make them more affordable. The duty on sunflower oil, both crude and refined, was reduced by 15 per percentage points. Cooking oil prices have been rising over the last few weeks. 

 Said A. Prasanna, vice president research ICICI Securities, The customs duty cut will help contain price rise ... but really it will be monetary policy which would really impact inflation in the short to medium term. The RBI has already taken some steps and we expect more in that vein to curb money supply. Money supply has been rising at more than 20 per cent, while credit has been rising at 30 per cent, helping boost demand and prices. 

 But ultimately the best way of taming food price rise in the long run as Chidambaram said at the traditional post-budget that sharp increase in the allocation for agriculture (which) would result in higher output of wheat, paddy, pulses and oilseeds which (in turn) would cool down prices. 

 We have to eventually start producing enough agricultural goods to meet our needs. A country of Indias size cannot depend on Myanmar or Turkey to meets its requirements of pulses, he added.

 Worried by supply constraint-fuelled inflation, the government today announced several incentives to enhance the production of pulses, besides a move to bring 50 lakh new farmers under the bank credit mechanism.

 Giving details of budgetary proposals for agriculture during 2007-08, finance minister P Chidambaram said the government will also act on the recommendations of the R Radhakrishna Committees report on agricultural indebtedness which is in the process of finalisation. The budget has raised the allocation for farm credit to Rs 2.25 lakh crore from Rs 1.9 lakh crore during 2006-07.

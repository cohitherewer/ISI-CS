 IT on a hiring spree

 New Delhi, Jan. 21 (PTI): It rained jobs for IT professionals with the countrys top five software firms adding over 23,200 employees to their payrolls in the last quarter of 2006, while taking their total headcount to near 2,92,000. 

 The Fab Five of the Indian IT space TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Satyam and HCL Technologies hired 23,265 people in the three-month period ended December 31, with TCS coming out with the highest number of additions at 7,835.

 The collective employee strength of the countrys five biggest firms at the end of the October-December quarter stood at 2,91,830.

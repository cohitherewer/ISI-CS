 Chidambaram: Selloff drive

 New Delhi, March 19: The government would sell its remaining 10.27 per cent stake in Maruti Udyog Limited (MUL) next fiscal.

 The government has decided to do it in the next financial year, said finance minister P. Chidambaram, responding to certain media reports that said the government had put its plan to sell its stake in the company on hold.

 The financial bids for the governments remaining shares in Maruti will be invited next year, said sources, adding that the divestment process will be completed in the first half of 2007-08.

 The cabinet has already approved the plan for a stake sale in Maruti. This is, however, restricted to banks, financial institutions and Indian mutual funds. Japans Suzuki Motor Corporation owns a 54.2 per cent stake in Maruti. Since the government announced the sale of its residual stake in Maruti, which accounts for about half of the countrys passenger vehicle market, the companys stock price has witnessed a massive swing.

 The cabinet committee on economic affairs gave a go-ahead to the governments third and final stake sale in Maruti on December 21. The last date for submitting expressions of interest (EoI) was March 9.

 On February 22 this year, the government had invited expressions of interest for competitive bids. It had offered to sell all or part of its shareholding in Maruti to Indian public sector financial institutions, public sector banks and Indian mutual funds.

 The government was to sell 2,96,79,709 shares of Rs 5 each through competitive bidding and hoped to raise between Rs 2,400 crore and Rs 2,800 crore.

 When the decision was taken, the sensex was at 13384 with the companys shares trading at Rs 926.

 SingTel sets sights on Vodafone stake in Airtel

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Calling in 

 New Delhi, Jan. 15: Adding spice to the ongoing telecom take-over drama in the country, Singapore Telecommunications (SingTel) today officially declared it could raise its 30.49 per cent stake in Bharti Airtel if the Vodafone Group sells its 9.9 per cent stake in the Indian mobile telephone company. 

 Under the right terms and conditions, and if its offered to us, we will consider (raising our stake), said Lim Chuan Poh, SingTel chief executive for international operations. He refused to divulge any further details.

 A Vodafone spokesperson, however, denied that the company had approached SingTel with any offers.

 In 2005, British telecom giant Vodafone had picked up a 9.9 per cent stake in Bharti Airtel for $1.5 billion. It is now a major contender in the race for a 67 per cent stake in Hutchison Essar.

 If Vodafone wins Hutchison Essar, its inevitable that the British telecom major will have to exit from Bharti, as India does not allow an investor to have more than a 10 per cent stake in any two competing mobile service providers.

 Though Vodafones stake in Bharti is 0.1 per cent less than the stipulated 10 per cent limit, making it technically correct for the British telecom firm to have equity holding in another company in India, industry analysts said the ideal situation in case Vodafone acquires Hutchison Essar would be to offload its Bharti stake. 

 There are various underlying legal and managerial glitches in case Vodafone maintains equity holdings in both Bharti and Hutch, said industry analysts.

 Amid mounting speculation that Vodafone had already begun talks for disengagement with Bharti Airtel, chairman Sunil Mittal ruled out any such possibility. There is no question of Vodafone selling Bharti stake at this stage. Naturally there is no disengagement talks as such, said Mittal.

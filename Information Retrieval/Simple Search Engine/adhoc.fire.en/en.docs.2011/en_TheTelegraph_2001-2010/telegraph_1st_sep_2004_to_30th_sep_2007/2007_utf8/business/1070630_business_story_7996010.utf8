 New Delhi, June 29: Iran today invited Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf to Tehran to sign a tri-nation deal on natural gas.

 Officials said petroleum minister Murli Deora would meet his Pakistani counterpart in August to finalise the remaining bilateral issues on the multi-billion-dollar gas pipeline deal before the heads of the three nations meet in Tehran.

 Iran expects to start supplying the gas to India and Pakistan by 2011 through the proposed $7-billion pipeline.

 However, gas pricing issues and global politics could still stymie finalising the contract which would allow the transportation of the gas from Iran to India via Pakistan.

 The US objected to the 2,100km pipeline as it was reluctant to encourage business with Iran because of Tehrans aggressive nuclear policy.

 Moreover, the three nations have not yet reached an agreement on the frequency with which the initial gas price will be revised.

 An Iranian demand to revise the price every three years is still to be resolved, said petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan.

 India and Pakistan, however, want the price to be constant or near constant for the 25-year duration of the gas-supply contract.

 Another issue being discussed is the transit fee that Pakistan will receive for allowing the gas to flow to India. The fee demanded by Islamabad is $0.493 per mmbtu while India was willing to pay $0.20 per mmbtu.

 Officials said each country planned to lay the pipeline in its own territory, instead of adopting a consortium approach.

 Iran has completed 18 per cent of the work for the pipeline, which will supply the gas from the South Pars field to the Iran-Pakistan border, said Hojjatollah Ghanimifard, an international affairs director of the National Iranian Oil Company.

 Pakistan said work was yet to begin on a 1,000-km stretch of the pipeline to India.

 Home movers get a new ally

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, May 13: Help is at hand for home movers changing cities.

 Hyderabad-based DRS Logistics has offered to free them of their hassles, right from booking an air ticket to finding an accommodation. 

 The service is being offered under the brand name, Relocation Retail. Initially, the company plans to set up shop in 10 cities, including Calcutta. 

 The first store will come up in Hyderabad. We want to start with the IT hubs since techies are known to frequently shift base, Anjani Kumar Agarwal, director, DRS Logistics Ltd, said. 

 The city will have its first store in Sector V, Salt Lake.

 Apart from packing and moving jobs, the company will book air tickets for its clients. It is in talks with airliners to secure extra luggage space in flights.

 For every Rs 25,000 spent on packing, a customer will get a one-night free stay at either a hotel or a guest house. 

 The company will also provide free coupons to Pizza Hut outlets.

 Expansion plans

 DRS Logistics is expanding in other segments as well. 

 It is building a 14 lakh square foot warehousing space in six cities. It has recently received Rs 100 crore as private equity from Kotak Mahindra.

 The company plans to add another 40 lakh square foot of warehousing space in the next two years, to become the largest player in the segment.

 It has also sought approval from the director general of civil aviation for cargo service.

 Agarwal said the company was looking at acquisitions and joint ventures with foreign firms. 

 Kotak Mahindra will support its acquisition plans, Agarwal said.

 DRS Logistics plans to make an initial public offer next year to fund its expansion plans.

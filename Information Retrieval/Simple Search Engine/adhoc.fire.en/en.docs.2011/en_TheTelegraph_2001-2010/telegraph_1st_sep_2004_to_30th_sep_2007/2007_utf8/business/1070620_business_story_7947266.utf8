 Yahoo banks on Yang for profit push

 Yang: New role

 San Francisco, June 19 (Reuters): Yahoo Inc on Monday tapped co-founder Jerry Yang to replace chief executive Terry Semel, bowing to investor pressure as the Internet media company has failed to keep up with rival Google Inc.

 Semel will take over as the boards non-executive chairman, and the company named Susan Decker, its former chief financial officer, as president. She will head the advertising and media business operations.

 Yahoo also warned that slower growth in display advertising this quarter would offset a better-than-expected performance from its recently upgraded search advertising business.

 As a result, it expected second-quarter revenue to land in the lower half of its previously stated outlook which, excluding the cost of payments to advertising partners, was projected in April at between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion.

 Yangs return to the head of the company he helped set up 13 years ago also heightened speculation that Yahoo may be poised for more drastic moves. These could include possible partnerships with rivals or a merger with the likes of Microsoft Corporation, Time Warner Incs AOL or News Corps MySpace, CNBC television reported.

 Shares of Yahoo were the most heavily traded on Nasdaq on Monday, gaining as much as 6 per cent after the news.

 The shareholders certainly want management to explore all M amp;A options and it certainly looks like they are now going to have to do that, Kim Caughey, analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, said of potential merger and acquisitions.

 Yang, 38, co-founded Yahoo in 1994 with fellow Stanford University student David Filo as a navigational guide in the Webs early days. Born in Taipei, Yang was raised in the heart of Silicon Valley after his family emigrated to San Jose.

 For more than a decade Yang has had the title of Chief Yahoo, playing a key role in negotiating business development deals for the company.

 Ford bets big on eastern region

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 18: Ford India expects the eastern regions contribution to its sales to rise to 18 per cent on a par with the national average from 15 per cent now.

 The company plans to increase the number of dealers to 11 in the region. It has six dealers at present two each in Jharkhand and Assam and one each in Bengal and Orissa.

 We have been growing steadily in the east for the past few years. Although it is primarily a small car market, the next level of growth will be from sedans, said Scott McCormack, vice-president (marketing, sales and service), Ford India.

 The company sold 42,000 vehicles in the country last year an 82 per cent year-on-year growth. Many of these were recently launched models and variants. 

 We expect the growth rate to stabilise, McCormack said.

 India is depending more on diesel variants in line with environmentally conscious European countries, where 50 per cent vehicles run on diesel.

 Around 70 per cent of the Fiesta models sold in the country were diesel variants.

 Ford sells E-10 and E-20-compliant cars in the country. The models can use 10 and 20 per cent ethanol mixed with their fuel, respectively.

 Calcutta, May 7: Tea exports to Pakistan are set to touch 25 million kg by the next two to three years.

 Around 2.7 million kg have been exported to the neighbouring country from January to March. North Indian varieties have also made inroads into the Pakistani market.

 Last year, 14 million kg were exported to Pakistan.

 China, with a production of 1,024 million kg, has replaced India as the largest producer of tea. However, according to the Tea Board, production in 2007 would be more than last years 955 million kg.

 The overall export target for this year would be around 210 million kg, up from around 203.8 million kg last year.

 The visit to Pakistan was successful and the delegation covered Lahore, Peshawar and other important markets. Pakistans commerce ministry officials assured us of a composite dialogue between the two countries in July where the suggestions of the Indians would be taken up. These include opening up of land trade, including cargo movement by rail, and preferential trading arrangements such as lower customs duty, said Basudeb Banerjee, chairman of the Tea Board.

 The Indian delegation also visited the offices of blender packers who wanted an Indian Tea Centre in Karachi on similar lines of that being conceptualised in Egypt.

 The centre will showcase Indian varieties from each region Assam, Niligiri and Dooars/Terai. 

 The Tea Board expects Pakistan to contribute to at least 10 per cent of exports. The contribution of Egypt is also set to increase this year from 2.7 million kg to between six and 10 million kg. Markets like Iraq, which imported 42.13 million kg of Indian tea, still remain volatile. It is, therefore, of paramount importance that we have access to other global markets, Banerjee said. A Pakistani delegation will visit Egypt during July-August.

 E-auction

 NSE.IT, a subsidiary of the National Stock Exchange, has been appointed the IT consultant to design and operate the tea e-auction system.

 The stakeholder meetings with NSE.IT would take place from June and the system is likely to be operational from November/December.

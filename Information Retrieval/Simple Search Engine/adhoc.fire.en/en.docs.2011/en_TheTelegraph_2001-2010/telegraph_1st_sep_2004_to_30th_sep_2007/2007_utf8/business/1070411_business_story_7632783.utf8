 New Delhi, April 10: The government expects to meet the revised direct tax target of Rs 229,272 crore set for 2006-07, finance minister P. Chidambaram said here today.

 For the last year, revised estimates (for direct tax collections) set an ambitious target of over Rs 229,000 crore. I am confident that when the final data comes, we would achieve the target, Chidambaram said while launching the video conference facility of the income tax department.

 Robust growth in earnings of companies and salaries last fiscal had prompted an upward revision of the target from Rs 211,000 crore.

 According to the latest data, the government has collected Rs 223,797.1 crore. This comprises Rs 141,915.4 crore in corporate tax, Rs 71,011.4 crore in personal income tax, Rs 5,331.7 crore in fringe benefit tax, Rs 4,729.5 crore in securities transaction tax and Rs 505.4 crore in banking cash transaction tax.

 A spokesperson of the Central Board of Direct Taxes said the government expected more tax inflows, which would help achieve the target. It takes more than a month for the government to collate all tax figures.

 Delhi, which is the second largest contributor of direct taxes after Mumbai, has, so far, collected Rs 1,000 crore less than the revised target of Rs 38,646 crore, according to an official.

 Other tax officials from different circles were confident of meeting or surpassing the revised targets. For the current fiscal, a target of Rs 267,000 crore has been set for direct tax collections.

 All these and more can be achieved if we have faith in technology and keep communication channels open, constantly upgrade the quality of information with the department and share such information with all field formations, Chidambaram said. 

 The video conference facility connects the finance ministry with 46 cities, headed by chief commissioners of income tax, and the director general of National Academy of Direct Taxes.

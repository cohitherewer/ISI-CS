 Essar Chem to forge ties with French firm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 22: Essar Chemicals, part of the Essar Group, is planning a joint venture with French chemical company Arkema in acrylic acid and esters. 

 The proposed unit, to be located close to Essar Oils refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat, will use the propylene from the refinery as feedstock. 

 The Essar group said in a press statement today that it signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Arkema to explore the feasibility of a 50:50 joint venture in acrylic acid and esters. 

 The release said the plant fitted with Arkemas plans to develop its acrylics business in the fast growing regions and would help add value to the outputs of the Essar refinery. The group, however, did not disclose the financial details of the proposed unit. 

 The plant will go onstream in 2010. 

 This unit will be the first acrylic acid plant to be built in India and will serve the fast growing market in this part of the world. Its location will be ideal to supply both the Indian and the Asian markets, said Henri Dugert, group president of Arkemas acrylics business unit. 

 Essar Group director Anshuman Ruia said, The group is set to move up the value chain in all their businesses. This foray would enhance the potential of Essar Oils refinery from where main feedstock propylene would be supplied for the acrylic complex. This deal will provide strategic leverage in Indian chemical market to both companies. 

 Arkema makes vinyl products, industrial chemicals and performance products.

 Wipro weighs funding options for buyouts

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, Aug. 26: Wipro Technologies is on the prowl for more buyouts especially in Germany and Canada and is ready to look at acquisition modes other than all-cash deals.

 We generate over $100-million reserves every quarter and all-cash deals are not the only mode. Funding is not a problem. We can look at equity, joint ventures or any mode that suits us best, Sudip Banerjee, president enterprise solutions and chief strategist Wipro Technologies, told The Telegraph.

 Banerjee added that cash reserves till June 30, 2007, amounting to Rs 3,200 crore, would be used for the Infocrossing deal worth $600 million (Rs 2,460 crore).

 Over the years, Wipro has gradually increased the value of its acquisitions. 

 The company started with the $10-million computer-aided design company Quantech and went on to buy the $246-million FMCG company Unza. 

 Its latest acquisition is the $600-million Infocrossing.

 The Infocrossing deal will help Wipro expand its infrastructure management solutions business. 

 The company plans to increase combined revenues to $1 billion from $0.5 billion in two to three years.

 New centres

 Wipro Technologies is also planning to set up centres at university towns in the West. The first such centre in the US will be in Georgia.

 This will give us access to a ready talent pool. Such towns surround a renowned university and therefore there will be students wanting to work in the vicinity, Banerjee said.

 Wipro will open a centre in Shanghai this month and is planning another in Chengdu later this year. 

 Each of the Chinese centre will employ around 300 people by the end of the year. 

 They will cater to the Japanese and South Korean markets.

 Staff strength

 In a year and a half, the company plans to ramp up its staff strength at its Calcutta centre to 7,000 from 4,000. 

 For further expansion in Calcutta, we hope we will get land. We want a plot in a strategic location close to our campus, where we do not have to start building the associated infrastructure from scratch, Banerjee said.

 The construction of the 25-acre Bhubaneswar campus will start soon. 

 It takes about two years from when the plot is handed over to the beginning of construction. So we hope to get the land soon, said Banerjee. 

 Wipros exports from the Calcutta centre are projected to reach Rs 400 crore this fiscal. 

 Exports have been growing at over 50 per cent on a year-on-year basis.

 Cairo centre

 Wipro Technologies has signed an MoU with Egypts information technology industry development Agency to set up a global development centre in Cairos smart village technology park, a PTI report said.

 The IT major intends to provide software development, integration and consulting services from the centre.

 Corus shareholders vote for Tata offer

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, March 7: Corus shareholders today approved the $11.3-billion Tata offer to buy the Anglo-Dutch steel company with an overwhelming majority. 

 Holders of 96 per cent shares of the Corus group voted in favour of the Tata bid at an extraordinary general meeting held today, where about 23 per cent shareholders voted by proxy.

 The acquisition, touted as Indias largest overseas deal till date, will take effect on April 2 and Corus shares will cease to trade on exchanges from March 29.

 Tata Steel will seek delisting of Corus shares on the bourses after that. Corus Group Plc, formerly known as British Steel Plc, will be an unlisted wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Steel UK.

 Tata Steel is pleased with the outcome of the EGM. It stands committed to work along with Corus to create a vibrant and value creating enterprise, said Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman.

 After the $11.3-billion buy, Tata Steel will be elevated to the position of fifth largest steelmaker of the world from the present position of 56th.

 Tata Steels capacity will go up to 24 million tonnes from 5 mt at present.

 Tata offered 608 pence a share in January for Corus, beating a competing proposal from Brazils Companhia Siderurgica Nacional SA in a nine round auction bidding process initiated by the UK Takeover Panel in January. The Tatas had first expressed their interest in Corus on October 5, 2006. 

 CSN came to the fray and rocked the boat in November.

 The Tata buy is the second biggest in the industry, behind Mittal Steels $38.3-billion takeover of Arcelor SA last year. 

 Meanwhile, agencies quoted Corus CEO Philippe Varin as saying that the intention of this acquisition is about growth, not about job losses.

 Jet Air back in black

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 26: Jet Airways has hauled itself back into the black.

 The countrys largest airline, with a market share of over 31 per cent, had stunned the aviation industry by reporting its first-ever loss of Rs 45 crore in the first quarter (April-June) and topped that with a Rs 55 crore loss in the second quarter (July-September). It had blamed the over Rs 100-crore loss in the first six months of the last fiscal on rising fuel costs and the crippling burden of its overseas operations.

 The airline which had weathered a year-long strife with the Roys of Air Sahara over the terms of the takeover of the troubled airline and struggled to cope in a market gouged by deep price cuts clawed back in the third and the fourth quarters to post a net profit of Rs 27.94 crore on a turnover of Rs 7,401.31 crore.

 It can count itself lucky: very few other airlines will be reporting profits during the year gone by with analysts forecasting a loss of Rs 2,000 crore for the industry as a whole.

 The fourth quarter (January-March) was its best with profits rising to Rs 88 crore on net sales of Rs 1,978 crore which was attributed to improved load factors and higher international earnings. However, profits for the year as a whole fell 93.8 per cent from Rs 452.04 crore for the year ended March 31, 2006.

 On Tuesday, the Jet Airways board also approved a $400-million rights issue to fund its expansion and overhaul Air Sahara, which is now named JetLite. The rights issue is expected in the next four months. The airline recommended a dividend of 60 per cent (Rs 6 per equity share of Rs 10 each) the same as last year.

 Surbhi Chawla, analyst at Angel Broking, said the consolidation in the aviation industry signalled by the recent move by Kingfisher to pick up a 26 per cent stake in Deccan Aviation, the creation of the Jet Airways-JetLite combine and the impending merger of Indian and Air India augured well for the future. We will now have three strong groups with 80 per cent market share, all of whom are focussed on attaining higher profits.

 Another analyst from a foreign brokerage, who did not wish to be identified, said Jet Airways would see its yields improve in its domestic as well as international operations. The company has indicated that operations of all its international routes are profitable, he added.

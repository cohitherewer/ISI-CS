 GM eyes Malaysian auto firm

 Lots at stake

 Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 15 (Reuters): General Motors (GM) has shown interest in Malaysias state-controlled auto firm, Proton Holdings. 

 The comments by Nor Mohamed Yakcop, Malaysias second finance minister on Monday, confirmed newspaper reports that GM may bid for the loss-making firm. Proton shares were up by 10 percent to a 13-month high. By 7:38 GMT shares were 6.3 percent higher at 6.80 ringgit. 

 The Business Times said on Saturday that GM was prepared to offer up to 10 ringgit ($2.85) for each Proton share, a premium of nearly 50 per cent to Mondays price and valuing the Malaysian firm at $1.6 billion, if the US firm is allowed to control Protons finances and manage its vendor system. 

 However, an analyst said thats too rich a valuation for Proton. Thats too gung-ho, said Vincent Khoo, head of research at Mayban Securities in Kuala Lumpur. Protons book value cannot be matched by its current earnings generation, he added.

 Proton, a long-time beneficiary of state protection, is losing local market share and struggling in export markets against South Korean and Japanese. 

 Nor Mohamed declined to give the details about GMs intentions but noted that Frances PSA Peugeot Citroen and Germanys Volkswagen were also interested in Proton. 

 Let me put it this way; GM has shown interest in Proton and if they put in a bid we will consider it, Nor Mohamed told reporters. 

 There are three foreign companies that are interested and they come in different forms and proposals. We are now finalising the discussions and comparisons as they are not identical interests, he said. GM planned to submit a bid for Proton this week, The Business Times reported, quoting sources familiar with GMs operations in Malaysia. 

 The Malaysian government controls Proton through its state-investment firm Khazanah Nasional, which owned 42.74 per cent in the carmaker as on December 8. It also controls an undetermined additional amount of Proton through direct and indirect holdings held by other state firms and agencies.

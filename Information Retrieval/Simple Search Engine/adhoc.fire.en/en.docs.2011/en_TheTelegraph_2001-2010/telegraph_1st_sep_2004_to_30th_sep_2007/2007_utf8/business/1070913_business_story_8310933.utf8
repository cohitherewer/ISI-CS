 Rangarajan remedy for reform riddle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, Sept. 12: Chakravarthi Rangarajan, chairman of the economic advisory council to the Prime Minister, today suggested a way to break the logjam over financial sector reforms that would allow the government to reduce its stake in banks and financial institutions below 51 per cent.

 The former RBI governor said the Centre could consider the idea of stretching the definition of government to include entities such as the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), which are quasi-government entities anyway and are likely to remain an integral part of the government system in the future.

 If the proposal is accepted, it would allow the government to reduce its direct stake in banks and FIs below the statutorily mandated level of 51 per cent and the shortfall could be covered by counting up the LICs investment in these banks.

 The Left has been bitterly opposed to the idea of reducing the governments stake in banks below 51 per cent and Rangarajans proposal is engineered to head off their criticism. It remains to be seen whether the Left will buy the formula.

 The LIC is the largest state-owned investor in banks and companies. For instance, the LIC has a 26 per cent stake in Corporation Bank and holds between 1 and 3 per cent in several other banks, including the SBI.

 Rangarajan said the government had been looking at only two options till date: the first was to shovel more money into banks and the other was to reduce its stake below 51 per cent. The third alternative would allow the government to reduce its stake and yet retain a controlling interest in the banks.

 He said banks need huge amounts of capital to meet the demand for investments and credit in a buoyant economy. It is estimated that investments of around $500 billion will be required in the next three to five years. 

 In addition, banks must meet requirements arising from implementation of Basel II norms from March next year.

 The banks have said the mandatory limit on government holding was hindering them from raising resources through the equity markets. 

 At present, the share of the government in public sector banks cannot go below 51 per cent and in the case of most banks, the government holding is close to the limit. 

 Although the RBI has allowed banks to raise resources through alternative means such as hybrid capital, banking circles have said the resource-raising capability of these instruments are also limited.

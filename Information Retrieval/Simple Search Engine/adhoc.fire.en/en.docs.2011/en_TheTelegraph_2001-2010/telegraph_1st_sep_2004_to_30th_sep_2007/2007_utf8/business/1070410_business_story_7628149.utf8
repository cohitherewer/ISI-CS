 New Delhi, April 9: The Hong Kong-based Hutchison Telecom International Limited (HTIL) is expected to submit details of its loan agreements with the two Indian minority shareholders in Hutchison Essar this week to the finance ministry.

 This is required to clear the way for UK telecom firm Vodafone to complete the $11.1-billion acquisition of Hutch Essar, in which it (Vodafone) has bought a controlling stake of 52 per cent.

 The Foreign Investment Promotion Board, which is likely to meet on April 23 to look into the loan details, is investigating the ownership of the 12.26 per cent stake in Vodafone Essar. 

 The stake is held between Hutch Essar managing director Asim Ghosh and Max group chairman Analjit Singh.

 The FIPB, at the instance of the Reserve Bank of India, is examining a possible breach of the Foreign Exchange Management Act and foreign direct investment (FDI) norms in telecom in Hutch Essars holding structure.

 FDI proposals 

 The government today gave its nod to the sale of 6 per cent equity in the National Stock Exchange to foreign investors. This was among the 13 FDI proposals worth Rs 477 crore cleared by the government.

 Three Mauritius-based companies MS Strategic (Mauritius), Actis Investment Holdings and Citigroup Strategic Holdings will collectively pick up a 6 per cent stake in NSE from IDBI, State Bank of India, SBI Capital Markets, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce and Corporation Bank.

 The other proposals cleared included those of Sweden-based Quinn Logistics, US-based Worldcom Communications (name changed to Verizon Communications) and Vonage Holdings Corporations, Mumbai-based Rolta India and ASC Enterprise.

 Kerkorian offers $4.5bn for Chrysler

 Detroit, April 6 (Reuters): Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, almost 10 years after his failed first attempt to buy Chrysler, reentered the fray on Thursday and offered to pay $4.5 billion to buy the struggling automaker from DaimlerChrysler, which paid almost $40 billion for it in 1998.

 The 89-year-old Kerkorian, once Chryslers largest shareholder, said in a letter from his investment company Tracinda Corp that the offer is contingent on Chrysler working out a favourable labour contract with the United Auto Workers union.

 It was the first publicly disclosed bid for Chrysler and sent DaimlerChryslers US-listed shares up almost 5 per ent.

 Kerkorian is willing to put down a $100 million deposit as a sign of good faith.

 DaimlerChrysler spokesman Thomas Froehlich said, All options are open, but declined to comment on Tracindas offer.

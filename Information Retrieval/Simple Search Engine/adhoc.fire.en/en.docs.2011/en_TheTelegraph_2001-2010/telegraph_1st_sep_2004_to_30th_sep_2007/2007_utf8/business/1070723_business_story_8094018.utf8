 OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, July 22: A recent employment outlook survey revealed that banking, financial and insurance sectors in Calcutta are on a hiring spree.

 According to TeamLease Services Ltds fourth-quarter employment outlook report for July-September 2007, Calcutta showed the highest hiring outlook growth rate at 5 per cent.

 The hiring outlook in the city showed a growth rate of 4 per cent over the previous quarters to reach 69 index points, the TeamLease employment outlook survey said.

 Moreover, banking, financial and insurance sectors in Calcutta reported the highest growth rate in the country with a more than 50 per cent increase over the last quarter.

 In Mumbai, financial services, banking, insurance and infrastructure sectors have shown the highest growth. However, Mumbai also showed a decline in IT, retail, media and FMCG. 

 Delhi, which has been consistently negative in its employment outlook growth, saw a sharp 5 per cent rise this quarter, the study said.

 TeamLease Services vice-president Sampath Shetty said, The financial services and infrastructure sectors have contributed towards the positive business confidence over the past two quarters. We see the challenges Indian companies face to manage the shortfall in manpower supply. 

 According to the report, marketing and IT sectors will see the highest recruitment in the last quarter of this fiscal; the growth rate can even reach 20 per cent. 

 The administration and IT sectors will have a high rate of recruitment in this fiscal, the study said.

 The report said companies were expected to hire mostly at the junior-level in the last quarter of this fiscal. There will be little middle-level hiring and even less senior-level recruitment.

 The IT sector continues to drive employment growth in Bangalore, Pune and Hyderabad. In New Delhi and Hyderabad, information technology-enabled services was a major recruitment area. 

 The manufacturing and engineering sector is showing much employment growth in Chennai and Pune. The financial services sector is the major contributor to employment growth in Mumbai and Calcutta. 

 The financial services and infrastructure sectors have contributed towards the positive business confidence over the past two quarters. 

 The challenge for Indian companies is to overcome the shortfall in manpower supply to leverage the growth of the economy, said the survey.

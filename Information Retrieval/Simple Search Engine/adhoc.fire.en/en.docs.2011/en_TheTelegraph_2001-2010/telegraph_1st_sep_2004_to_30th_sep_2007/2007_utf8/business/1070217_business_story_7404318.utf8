 Forex kitty swells by $5bn

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 16: The forex reserves rose by $5 billion in the week ended February 9, according to data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

 The strong growth is being attributed to aggressive dollar buying by the RBI. While dollar inflows have been robust recently, it has caused an appreciation in the value of the rupee, which has hurt exporters. To retain the export edge, the RBI is purchasing dollars to stem the rise of the rupee.

 According to RBI figures, Indias total forex reserves stood at $185.078 billion compared with $180.047 billion in the week ended February 2, when the reserves had risen by $995 million. 

 Foreign currency assets increased by close to $5.12 billion to $178.08 billion during the week. However, gold reserves remained the same at $6.529 billion.

 Its probably the highest ever, said Jamal Mecklai, CEO of Mecklai Financial, on the surge in reserves. Mecklai added that there has been a huge amount of inflows in recent times and the $5-billion addition has come as the central bank has been fighting rupee appreciation.

 On Thursday, the rupee had ended higher against the dollar as the greenback was weak vis--vis the yen. However, its gains were capped by what dealers called central bank intervention. It ended at 44.10 per dollar against 44.13 on Wednesday. Forex circles added that the central bank has been buying dollars throughout this week .

 RBIs dollar buying has led to an increase in money supply. This is because buying dollars infuses rupee resources into the system. This increase in liquidity perhaps made the central bank announce a 50-basis-point hike in cash reserve ratio (CRR) this week.

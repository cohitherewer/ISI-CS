 Myanmar finds China gas price better

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 21: Myanmar appears to have left India in the lurch, preferring to sell its natural gas to China for a better price.

 Sources said Myanmar told an Indian delegation last week that it wanted to export gas from its discoveries in offshore Block A-1 and potential reserves in Block A-3 to China.

 ONGC Videsh Ltd and GAIL (India) have a 30 per cent stake in blocks A-1 and A-3 and South Koreas Daewoo is the operator with a 60 per cent interest. South Korea-based KoGas has the remaining 10 per cent stake.

 However, the Myanmar government owns 65 per cent of this gas and the remaining 45 per cent is shared by the Indian and Korean companies according to the stakes they hold.

 Last year, GAIL proposed a 1,573-km pipeline from Myanmar through Mizoram and Assam to Bengal and to Gaya in Bihar to transport gas from the A-1 and A-3 blocks. China and Thailand had submitted competing pipeline proposals.

 Myanmar had said the volumes in A-1 were not sufficient to support a pipeline and called for bids to sell the gas in its liquefied form. GAIL bid for 3.5 million tonnes of LNG at $5 per million British thermal unit, which was lower than Marubeni of Japan and KoGas.

 The Myanmar government, however, is looking for a much higher price for its gas than what GAIL is willing to offer. 

 Myanmar is believed to have rejected the GAIL bid for a smaller quantity of liquefied natural gas (LNG) that could be shipped to India.

 Sources said while Gail had been chosen as the preferred buyer for the gas in the A1 block, it has not been able to match the price that Myanmar wants.

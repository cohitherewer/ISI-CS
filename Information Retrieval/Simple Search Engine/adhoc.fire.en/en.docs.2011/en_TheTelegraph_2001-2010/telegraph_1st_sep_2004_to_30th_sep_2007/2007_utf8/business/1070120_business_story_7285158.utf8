 Chennai, Jan. 19: Union shipping and transport minister T.R. Baalu said his ministry has initiated the process to develop a deep sea port near Calcutta at an estimated cost of Rs 7,000 crore.

 An expression of interest to set up this port has been issued. I have already discussed the project with Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the minister said here.

 He was presiding over an international conference on Infrastructure Development in the Port Sector to mark the 125th anniversary of the Chennai Port Trust. 

 Baalu denied that he was allotting choice projects mainly to Tamil Nadu. It was I who proposed a deep sea port for Calcutta to Buddhadebji, Baalu said, referring to CPI(M) politburo member Sitaram Yechurys observations on the shipping ministrys decision to set up the National Maritime University in Chennai. 

 Yechury said though he was happy that the university was to be set up in Chennai, the birth place of the CPI(M) leader, he still faced a dilemma, as I got elected (to Rajya Sabha) from Calcutta, hinting that Bengals capital also needed big projects in shipping and infrastructure.

 Baalu said the Centre was not discriminating against any region. The UPA government is committed to giving equal opportunity for development to each state, Baalu added. 

 Stressing the need for expansion in the shipping and ports sector, Baalu said the country needed second and third-generation cargo vessels, particularly the new type of large crude carriers, to get a handsome share of international shipping.

 Indian tax laws for merchant shipping also needed a re-look, he added.

 At the same time, managers should find out to what extent existing ports could handle very large vessels as the planning for shipping and ports expansion should be done simultaneously, he said.

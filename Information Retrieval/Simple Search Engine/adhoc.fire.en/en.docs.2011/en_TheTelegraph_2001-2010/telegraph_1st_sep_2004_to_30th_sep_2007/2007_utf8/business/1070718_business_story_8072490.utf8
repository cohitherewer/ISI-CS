 Satyam bags global orders

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 17: IT solutions provider Satyam today announced that it bagged four deals in Singapore, Australia and the UAE.

 Two deals from the Singapore government are primarily outsourcing and IT services contracts. 

 Satyam will implement a enterprise financial management solution for the Emirates Bank, which will help the bank have better control at the group level and also augment its business strategy to enhance its internal processes. 

 Almost 17 per cent of our revenues come from the ROW (rest of the world) region. Outsourcing forecasts in this region are promising in the coming years. We have one of the largest presence in the ROW region. Our globalisation-cum-localisation approach will enable us to consolidate our position in this market, said Satyams director Virender Aggarwal.

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: Bajaj Auto Limited, which is eyeing a Rs 10,000-crore turnover this fiscal, will set up a facility with common three- and four-wheeler platforms to make goods and passenger carriers.

 We are looking at a greenfield facility with a production capacity of approximately half-a-million units. We will decide on the location by the year-end. The plant will house common platforms for both three- and four-wheelers. We will start with a goods carrier. However, the first product is at least two years away, Bajaj Auto managing director Rajiv Bajaj said.

 Sources said the plant would come up either in Chakan in Maharashtra or Pantnagar in Uttaranchal. Bajaj already has manufacturing facilities in both these places as well as at Akurdi and Waluj in Maharashtra.

 Bajaj Auto has set a target to sell 2.8 million vehicles, Rajiv Bajaj said at the launch of the Pulsar 200-cc motorcycle in the capital today. The company expects a topline growth of 25 per cent over the last fiscal.

 Demerger move

 Rajiv Bajaj today dodged queries on the proposed demerger of the flagship company into two separate entities auto and finance.

 Amid reports of differences between the two brothers Rajiv and Sanjiv Rajiv Bajaj said, He (Sanjiv) keeps the companys books and I make the bikes. I cant keep the books and he cant make bikes.

 Mukesh eyes GE Plastics

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, Jan. 10: Anil Ambani may be grabbing all the headlines, but brother Mukesh could soon be mulling a mega-buck global deal of his own.

 Speculation is rife that Mukesh Ambani who has preferred to focus his interests in the domestic market may be looking to mount a bid for General Electrics plastics business that is expected to be put on the block.

 GE has not officially confirmed whether it is planning to sell GE Plastics. However, that has not stopped the rumour mills from speculating that Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) will be one of the frontrunners in the race for the unit when GE decides to sell.

 RIL is determined to be among the leading global companies in the entire petrochemical chain and it is expected to look at both acquisitions and organic growth to achieve that goal.

 Reports in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times have said GE is planning to sell the plastics business whose value is estimated to be close to $10 billion. A few private equity funds have already been sounded. 

 Besides Apollo Management, these reports say the Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts amp; Company are also interested in the division. 

 If GE announces its intention to sell the business, there will be a pack of suitors, including RIL, Dow Chemical Company and Dupont.

 The plastics unit has an estimated revenue of $7 billion and the possibility of its sale has been rumoured for a long time. GE chairman Jeffrey Immelt had, in the past, hinted that he may sell some of the conglomerates commodity business.

 Sources close to RIL, however, dismissed the talk as mere speculation.

 Just because it is believed that some global companies may enter the fray, RILs name is being dragged into the arena, the source said. 

 He, however, added that the oil giant was open to the idea of growing through the inorganic route, a point that has often been highlighted by group chairman Mukesh Ambani even as it is pumping huge amounts of money to grow organically.

 Officials close to the company may be denying the news as mere speculation, but RIL has made one overseas acquisition already. 

 A couple of years back, RIL had successfully acquired German specialty polyester manufacturer Trevira for 80 million euro (Rs 430 crore). At the time of acquisition, Trevira was the market leader in Europe in high-value applications of polyester, particularly in automotive and home textiles.

 Last year, RIL was again in the news when reports said that it was zeroing in on acquiring the refinery and petrochemicals facilities of BP Plc in France and Belgium. The market talk then said that the bid size was up to $2 billion.

 Calcutta, May 14: The new infrastructure fund from SBI Mutual will have the freedom to invest 10 per cent of its net assets in shares of unlisted companies.

 This is because the fund is a three-year closed-end scheme, in contrast to open-end schemes in infrastructure from rivals. 

 The Sebi guidelines allow us to invest up to 10 per cent of the assets in unlisted stocks, Sanjay Sinha, chief investment officer, SBI Mutual Fund, said. 

 He said investments would be made in unlisted infrastructure companies. These companies should have plans for an IPO in the next three years, which is the duration of the infrastructure fund.

 Investment in the infrastructure sector is poised for a big leap. The approach paper of the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12) has estimated an investment of Rs 14.5 lakh crore in projects such as road building, power, ports, airports and telecom, Sinha Said. 

 The offer is open till June 8, and units will be available for repurchase from July. This offers an exit option to investors, who will have to pay a fee. After three years, the scheme will become open-ended with SIP facilities. 

 The other closed-end scheme of SBI Mutual is the OneIndia Fund, which does not invest in unlisted companies. Sinha, the head of equity investment at SBI Mutual, will take over as the chief investment officer from June 1. 

 He said there were plans for an offshore fund.

 This scheme will be marketed by Societe General, which has a 37 per cent stake in SBI Asset Management Company. The funds will be raised abroad for investments in India.

 Brazil ally for Tata bus ride

 Kant: On a long drive

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: After trumping Brazilians in the battle for Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus, the Tatas are ready to execute a little pirouette and dance the samba: they have tied up with Brazilian bus builder Marco Polo to build what is touted to be the worlds biggest bus body building manufacturing facility.

 Tata Motors will spend Rs 10,000 crore over the next three to four years to increase production capacity and introduce new models.

 However, managing director Ravi Kant did not reveal if the entire production will be for the domestic market or for exports as well. At present, we are in discussions with the state governments, he said. 

 He was speaking on the sidelines of a diesel summit organised by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). 

 Ace passenger version

 Meanwhile, the company said it will launch a passenger carrier version of Ace, the mini one-tonne truck, in the next six months. 

 We hope to launch the passenger carrier version of the mini truck in the next six months, said Kant. 

 Company sources, however, said the new Ace may be launched as early as next month. The Ace will be manufactured at Tata Motorss upcoming greenfield facility at Uttaranchal. The new facility will be used mainly for manufacturing light commercial vehicles. The plant will have a capacity to manufacture 1 lakh units. 

 Sources said the new multi purpose vehicle will be positioned against Marutis Omni and will be priced competitively. The Omni is priced between Rs 2.3 lakh and Rs 2.5 lakh (ex-showroom Mumbai). 

 With the new Ace, the company is following a strategy whereby it will launch multiple variants based on the same platform.

 The new MPV will target the same markets, semi-urban and rural, where the Rs 1-lakh car is expected to make a dent. The Ace MPV will be used to test the market potential and Tata Motors distribution network in these specific regions.

 Ace, one of the bestsellers from Tata Motors ultra light commercial vehicle segment, sells around 6,500 units a month.

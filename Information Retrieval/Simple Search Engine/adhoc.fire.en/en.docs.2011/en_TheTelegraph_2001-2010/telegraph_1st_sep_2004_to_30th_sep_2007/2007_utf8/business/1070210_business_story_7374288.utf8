 AMD Metplast in novel plan for sops 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Nifty move

 Calcutta, Feb. 9: This may sound a little bizarre: a company plans to ramp up capacity to enjoy a tax break and not because it needs the extra production.

 Delhi-based AMD Metplast India manufactures crown caps, closures and PET preforms (from which PET bottles are made).

 The company already has a 4,260-tonne capacity PET preform manufacturing facility in Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh that runs much below the 100 per cent capacity for three to four months a year.

 AMD Metplast now plans to set up a new plant to manufacture 2,700 tonnes of PET bottles at Neemrana in Rajasthan at an investment of Rs 22.58 crore.

 The company is investing in a new plant in Neemrana since it was required to to invest Rs 30 crore by December 2005 in the crown cap manufacturing plant to claim exemption from payment of Central Sales Tax that amounted to Rs 15.63 crore as on March 31, 2006.

 AMD Metplast had acquired a 10 acre plot at the Rajasthan State Industrial and Investment Corporation (RIICO) estate in Neemrana and set up a crown caps manufacturing plant at an investment of Rs 17 crore. According to a letter issued by the Rajasthan Board of Infrastructure Development and Investment Promotion, the company could avail of the exemption provided it invested up to Rs 30 crore in the project.

 We have got an extension till December 2007 to make that investment in Neemrana, said Ashok Gupta, managing director, AMD Metplast Ltd. The company is the largest supplier of crown caps and PET bottles to Hindustan CocaCola in the north Indian market.

 The company is seeking to raise Rs 75 crore with a public issue that will be floated on February 15. While Rs 22.58 crore from the issue proceeds will be set aside for the PET project at Neemrana, a sum of Rs 20 crore will be earmarked for long term capital requirements. Another Rs 12 crore will be used to repay loans it had taken from United Bank of India, State Bank of India and State Bank of Indore.

 AMD Metplast has loan liabilities of Rs 47.65 crore on its books as on March 31, 2006. 

 Interestingly, the companys loan and advances rose sharply during April-October. It gave loans and advances to the tune of Rs 10 crore during the seven months compared with less than Rs 2 crore in the whole of 2005-2006 financial year. 

 Late last year, AMD Metplast promoters formed at least six associate and subsidiary companies for real estate venture. Most of our loans and advances went to these companies, Gupta said.

 AMD Estate amp; Developers Pvt Ltd alone got Rs 8.5 crore loan from the parent AMD Metplast. This company has bought 30 acre of land in Rewari and we are targeting to acquire some 100 acres in future, Gupta said.

 Following the public issue AMD Metplasts equity capital base will increase more than two-fold to Rs 19.2 crore from Rs 9 crore at present.

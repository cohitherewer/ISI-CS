 Institutions back ICICI 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 22: ICICI Banks follow-on public offer closed today to a warm reception from institutions and a lukewarm one from retail investors. 

 While qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) lapped up the issue (subscribed by more than 23 times), the retail segment just managed to scrape through, data available till late night showed. 

 The issue was subscribed by more than 12 times. Merchant bankers said compared with other follow-on public offers, ICICI Banks issue had seen the maximum amount of bids from QIBs. 

 Data available with stock exchanges showed that for an issue size of 9.88 crore shares, the bank received bids for over 100 crore shares. Most of the bids were in the range of Rs 900-940 per share. 

 If you look at the over-subscription from QIBs alone, we can say that ICICI Banks offer has made the largest mobilisation in the history of Indian capital markets, sources said. 

 If the bank fixes the issue price at the upper end of the price band (Rs 950 per share), it will raise around Rs 9,400 crore from the domestic market alone. 

 Among institutions, Temasek, the State Bank of India and Warburg Pincus were the key bidders. 

 Temaseks bid, which was initially put at $1 billion, has gone up to $2 billion. The SBI has placed bids for over $1 billion, while Warburg Pincus has put in $900 million. 

 Sources added that the banks American depository shares issue has been over-subscribed too. Like the domestic issue, the response was great for ADS. The bank should easily mobilise more than Rs 17,000 crore from the two issues even if it does not exercise the greenshoe option, sources added.

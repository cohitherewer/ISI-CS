 Export duty on iron ore irks China

 Beijing, March 7 (PTI): Indias decision to levy export duty on iron ore, even without a grace period, has irked Chinese importers, who say the move would kill Indias largest market and affect the countrys credibility. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram announced last month a plan which took effect on March 1 to levy an export duty of Rs 300 per tonne of iron ore. 

 The policy will have considerable impact on the countrys iron ore imports, an official with the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters, said here. 

 He confirmed that the chamber of commerce held an urgent meeting here yesterday of iron ore importers to discuss its response to Indias duties. However, he declined to provide details of the meetings outcome. 

 China, the worlds biggest steel maker and consumer, is also the biggest iron ore consumer and importer. 

 India is now the third-largest exporter of iron ore to China after Australia and Brazil, accounting for 23 per cent of total imports. Iron ore constitutes over 55 per cent of Indias total exports to China. 

 Executive vice-chairman and secretary-general of China Iron and Steel Association, Luo Bingsheng Luo, has also protested against the surging iron ore prices.

 Such an imposition of taxes without a buffer period is a scary thing both for local and international business community as it jeopardises all long-term plans and commitments, Roy Sagnik, director of Txyco Ltd, said.

 Credibility of India as well as the Indian business community will suffer from such sudden taxes, Sagnik, who imports substantial amounts of iron ore from India, said.

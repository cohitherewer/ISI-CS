 Tribunal stays IPO scam order

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 11: The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) today stayed market regulator Sebis disgorgement order that had asked 10 entities, including depositories NSDL and CDSL, to cough up about Rs 116 crore for their role in the IPO scam.

 Admitting the appeal by the 10 affected parties, SATs presiding officer Justice N. K. Sodhi said, After detailed consideration in the disgorgement order, the operational part of the order has to be stayed.

 On November 21 last year, 11 months after it unearthed the IPO scam where investors opened multiple demat accounts to corner shares in 21 IPOs during 2003 to 2005, Sebi issued its first ever disgorgement order asking two depositories and eight depository participants to pay a disgorgement amount of around Rs 115.81 crore within six months. 

 We see no urgency for Sebi to go with a disgorgement order when the enquiry was still continuing. I think the board needs to wait and complete the enquiry first and then pass the disgorgement order, Sodhi said.

 I find it to be a unique and strange order where the quantum of penalty has been determined even before the enquiry has been completed, he said. 

 The National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) and its depository participants, including Karvy Stock Broking, HDFC Bank, Khandwala Integrated Financial Services, IDBI Bank, Jhaveri Securities, ING Vysya Bank and Pravin Ratilal Share amp; Stock Broking, were asked to pay Rs 90.02 crore.

 Likewise, the Central Depository Services Ltd (CDSL) and its depository participants Karvy Stock Broking and Pratik Stock Vision had been asked to jointly and severally disgorge Rs 25.80 crore. 

 Sebi had directed NSDL to pay Rs 45.01 crore and CDSL Rs 12.89 crore. Among the depository participants, Karvy Stock Broking has been asked to cough up the maximum amount of Rs 51.52 crore, HDFC Bank Rs 1.64 crore, ING Vysya Rs 55 lakh, IDBI Bank Rs 86 lakh, Jhaveri Securities Rs 44 lakh, Khandwala Rs 29 lakh, Pravin Ratilal Rs 68 lakh and Pratik Rs 1.93 crore.

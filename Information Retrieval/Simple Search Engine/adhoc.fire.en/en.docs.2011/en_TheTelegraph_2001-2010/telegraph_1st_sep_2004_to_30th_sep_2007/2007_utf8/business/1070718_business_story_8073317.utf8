 Middle path on FDI rules

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, July 17: The government is under pressure from multinationals to dilute Press Note 1.

 According to the note, foreign companies in joint ventures have to take no-objection certificates from Indian partners before setting up new entities in similar lines of business.

 Top officials said the government, which is reviewing its foreign direct investment policy, was keen on a middle path on this issue. The government needs to protect Indian industrys interests, while allaying a multinationals fears of a possible misuse of the no-objection certificate by the local partner.

 In addition to the certificate, Press Note 1, a modified version of an earlier Press Note 18, calls for clauses on conflict of interest in new joint ventures. Such clauses prevent the foreign partner from setting up another company for a certain period of time. A strict interpretation of the note, which was issued in 2005, often creates investment hurdles. 

 A global merger between two firms could see the Indian joint ventures stake transferred to a new company which may have independent plans for India.

 However, the joint venture may refuse to give a no-objection certificate. It may also be the case that a multinational is planning to bring superior technology through a 100 per cent subsidiary. The requirement of a permission from the local partner may scuttle its efforts.

 Indian industry, however, feels local companies are still not ready for a dilution of the note. They may become victims of ambitious global partners if the norms are relaxed.

 We feel it should continue in the present format for at least three more years, to see how well Indian corporate houses are able to negotiate conflict of interests and cooling off periods with their MNC partners, Ficci officials said.

 The officials said it was necessary to have a cooling off period between a split between the partners and a renewed entry by the foreign company.

 They said the government was likely to relax the note, despite objections from Indian industry, However, there is a need to prepare guidelines relating to conflict of interest.

 Small and medium enterprises are increasingly entering into collaborations with foreign companies. The officials said the conflict of interest clause is vague enough for multinationals to walk out of existing relationships and set up new firms.

 Mauritius FDI share exceeds 50%

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Feb. 11: Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow into India through Mauritius shot up to $4.01 billion during April to November. This is 55.5 per cent of the total FDI inflow of $7.23 billion in the eight-month period.

 According to the latest data available with the commerce ministry, Singapore, with an FDI of $512 million, has overtaken Germany to grab the third spot after the US from where $579 million was invested during April to November. This shows that after the comprehensive economic treaty with India was signed, the city state is emerging as an important financial hub for FDI inflows like Mauritius.

 However, since the double taxation avoidance agreement with Mauritius is more liberal, it continues to be the preferred choice for routing investments to India.

 Official figures show investments from Mauritius is higher both absolutely and in percentage terms. During 2003-04, Mauritius accounted for only 20 per cent of the FDI to India. Its share went up to 30 per cent in 2004-05 and has now surged to more than half the total FDI flows.

 Senior officials said while the treaty with Mauritius allows for quick movement of capital, it is not without its problems.

 For instance, nearly 80 per cent of the overseas corporate bodies (OCBs) operating in India are based in Mauritius, possibly to take advantage of the zero tax status that OCBs enjoy in the island nation because of local tax laws and the tax avoidance treaty with India.

 Direct involvement in stock market frauds by rogue overseas corporate bodies operating out of Mauritius was one of the key findings of the joint parliamentary committee report on stock market scams.

 In approvals for technology collaboration, the US tops the list, accounting for 22 per cent of the total number of proposals. 

 Germany, with 14 per cent, is ranked second followed by Japan and the UK with 10.9 per cent. Italy with 6 per cent is next on the list.

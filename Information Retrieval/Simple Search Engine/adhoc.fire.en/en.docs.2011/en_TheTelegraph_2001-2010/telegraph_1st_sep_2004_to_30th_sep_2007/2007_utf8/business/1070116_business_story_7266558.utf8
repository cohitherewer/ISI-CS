 Banks rule out SLR cut in medium term

 JAYATI GHOSE

 A long wait

 New Delhi, Jan. 15: Bankers believe that the Reserve Bank of India is unlikely to reduce the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) in the short to medium term as concerns over excess liquidity and rising inflation persist.

 According to the banking regulation act, every bank is required to maintain at the end of business every day, a minimum proportion of their deposits as liquid assets in the form of cash, gold and approved securities. The ratio of liquid assets to deposits is known as SLR.

 It is doubtful that the central bank would reduce SLR in the short term as that would defeat its recent CRR hike to tighten liquidity, said Prakash P. Mallya, CMD of Vijaya Bank.

 To curb inflation and tighten money flow in the market, the RBI had hiked the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 50 basis points to 5.5 per cent in two phases during December 23 and January 6. Despite the move, the inflation rate has jumped to 5.58 per cent on Friday the highest during the financial year. 

 Lowering the SLR would mean banks maintaining a lower stock of gilts, thereby allowing more funds for lending. But the present market scenario does not merit such a move, said Mallya.

 According to P.J. Nayak, chairman and managing director of UTI Bank, if the economy continues to grow at a buoyant pace, it will translate into larger tax inflows. This could lead to the government borrowing less through bond issues, which would remove the need for the RBI to tinker with SLR to infuse funds into the system.

 Industry analysts said the RBI would not be in any hurry to cut the SLR requirement for banks unless there is clarity on the government borrowing programme in 2007-08. The borrowing programme will be out only after the budget. That is why analysts feel that the SLR cut will only happen in the long run.

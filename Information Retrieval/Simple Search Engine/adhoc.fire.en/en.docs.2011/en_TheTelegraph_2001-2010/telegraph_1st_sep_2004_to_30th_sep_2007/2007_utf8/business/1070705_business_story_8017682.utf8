 Cadburys bubbly idea for kids

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Wide appeal

 Mumbai, July 4: Chocolate maker Cadbury India is reaching out to kids with a new offering: bubble gum. 

 Bubbaloo the brand it markets in 25 nations isnt expected to stretch its revenues much with an expected contribution of just 5 per cent. But it is a start in one of the fastest-growing confectionery markets in the world.

 Bubbaloo is a centre-filled bubble gum, which will be available here in two flavours strawberry and mixed fruit at a price of Re 1 per unit. 

 The company said it will start making the product at its Bangalore plant, in which it has invested over Rs 10 crore. The size of the confectionery market in India is around Rs 1,800 crore, and bubble gum accounts for almost 11 per cent. 

 Brands such as Boomer from Spains Joyco, and Big Babol from Italys Perfetti control about 87 per cent of the gum market in India. While it might be little difficult for Cadbury to gain a foothold in this segment, company officials believe that they will be able to achieve a double-digit market share in two to three years. 

 Anand Kripalu, managing director of Cadbury India, said, India is one of the fastest growing gum markets in the world. We see massive potential for Bubbaloo here. Bubbaloo, along with Halls and Eclairs, complements our confectionery portfolio and will significantly contribute to enhance our long-term leadership influence in the category. 

 Bubble gum will contribute about 5 per cent to our total sales in three to four years, Kripalu added. 

 The organised confectionery market in India is growing at a rate of 7-8 per cent annually. Considering the fact that per capita consumption of chocolate and bubble gum in India is much lower than that in the US, the market creates a huge potential for the confectionery manufacturers here. 

 Although there are only a few players thriving in Indias confectionery business, which makes it a easier to handle the competitive margins, a rise in raw material and input costs have put pressure on the pricing of finished products. In some cases, more than 50 per cent of the price goes towards packaging. 

 Overall, we have increased prices on finished products by about 3 per cent after the rise in various input costs, Kripalu said.

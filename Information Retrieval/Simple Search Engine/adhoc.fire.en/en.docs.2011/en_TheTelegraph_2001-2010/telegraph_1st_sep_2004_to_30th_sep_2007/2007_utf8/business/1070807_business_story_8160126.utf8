 Gain amp; pain in State Bank rate tweak

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New stand

 Mumbai, Aug. 6: The State Bank of India (SBI) today revised interest rates on its term deposits.

 The bank raised the highest rate it pays out by 25 basis points to 9 per cent, which will be given to senior citizens who park their money for a tenure ranging between three and 10 years. Earlier, it paid 8.75 per cent on deposits that were parked for over five years.

 At the same time, the countrys largest bank also tweaked some of the other rates: it lowered the interest rates on deposits between one year and less than two years by 25 basis points to 8 per cent, senior citizens will get only 8.5 per cent against 8.75 per cent earlier.

 However, it raised rates on deposits between 180 days and less than one year by 25 basis points to 6.75 per cent.

 The bank has also changed its longer tenure from five years and above to three years and up to 10 years and will now offer 8.5 per cent 25 basis points more than the 8.25 per cent it gave earlier.

 The lowering of interest rates is seen as a consequence of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raising the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 50 basis points to 7 per cent last week. 

 Soon after the RBIs decision, several public sector banks like the Bank of Baroda, the Bank of India and Canara Bank lowered their deposit rates by half a percentage point.

 The SBIs decision was expected. Over the past few months, deposits on certain maturities were above acceptable levels. On the other hand, its move to raise deposit rates on certain maturities is in line with other banks, a banker said. He added that the hike may also be part of the banks plan to attract more money into longer term deposits.

 The SBI today said that interest rate on term deposits of maturity between one year and less than two years have been revised downwards by 25 basis points to 8 per cent. 

 It kept interest rate on term deposits of maturity two years to less than three years same at 8.25 per cent.

 All these changes will be effective from August 9.

 New Delhi, Jan. 16: Petroleum minister Murli Deora today informed his Nigerian counterpart of IOCs willingness to set up a refinery in Nigeria. Deora also sought from Edmund Daukoru, the energy minister of Nigeria, higher crude from the African nation.

 India wants import of high quality Bonny light crude from Nigeria under a term contract be raised to 3 million tonnes (mt) a year from 2 mt.

 Deora discussed the possibility of Indian companies investing in liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in Nigeria and conveyed the interest of Indian oil companies in exploration and production projects in the country. 

 The consortium of Oil India and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had participated in the last round of bidding for exploration of blocks in 2005. The joint venture of ONGC and the Mittal Group was awarded two blocks in 2005. 

 The Nigerian side said they were willing to let IOC invest in the downstream oil sector. They said IOC could set up new refineries or buy stakes in state-owned refineries. 

 Daukoru also invited IOC to invest in LNG projects. He said Nigeria would enhance crude output which offered an opportunity to increase exports under the term contract supplies to India. 

 Reliance in Yemen

 Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) will set up a refinery in Yemen in a joint venture with Yemenese company Hood Oil.

 Yemen oil minister Khaled Mahfoudh Bahah said the refinery would initially process 50,000 barrels of oil daily and the capacity could be ramped up later. 

 Talking to journalists on the sidelines of the Petrotech conference here today, Petroleum minister Murli Deora said work would start this year and completed in three years.

 Bahah said the products of the refinery must be sold in the domestic market for the first five months, after which exports may be permitted.

 Saudi Aramco plans

 With Petrotech going into full swing, West Asian companies, such as Saudi Aramco, were sniffing business opportunities. The company is scouting for Indian experts in the upstream sector.

 Petrotech starts

 External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee today touted India as a hot hydrocarbon destination. 

 The minister threw an open invitation to the 140 companies attending the Petrotech conference to invest in the country as the bulk of oil and gas potential remains locked up in its basins.

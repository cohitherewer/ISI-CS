 Calcutta, Feb. 20: With the new cropping season round the corner, the auction centres at Guwahati, Calcutta and Siliguri have depleted older stocks. Three sales in each centre have been dropped.

 There was good and sustained demand for all CTC leaf and dust varieties on offer at the three auction centres.

 All sections of the domestic market were active. The small quantity of clean tea commanded a premium. Selected lines of the Assam sold between Rs 90 and Rs 100 and touched Rs 124 per kg. Quality of the end-of-season varieties, which comprised the bulk of the offerings, determined their saleability, said a report by J. Thomas amp; Co.

 There have been reports of good rain in February in most tea growing areas and initial crop prospects are encouraging, according to industry experts.

 The average closing price for north Indian tea for 2006 was higher by Rs 8.82 per kg while south Indian varieties were dearer by Rs 8.17 per kg on an average.

 In Calcutta auctions, prices rose from Rs 69.95 per kg in 2005 to Rs 79.51 per kg in 2006, an increase of Rs 9.56 per kg.

 Guwahati auctions also saw a price increase to Rs 68.55 per kg from Rs 60.49 per kg, while for Siliguri, the average price was Rs 65.42 per kg against Rs 57.97 per kg a year ago.

 In Jalpaiguri, there was a jump from Rs 52.59 per kg to Rs 63.45 per kg in 2006.

 This time last year, the south Indian markets were showing an upward trend in prices, with a dramatic increase every week, while the price of low-end varieties had doubled.

 North India was also expected to receive strong demand at buoyant price levels.

 The orthodox varieties are expected to fare well with consistent and growing demand from Russia and the West Asian countries. 

 Sri Lankan markets have surged with prices appreciating by 30 to 80 cents last week, following crop shortfalls because of a drought. This augurs well for the new seasons orthodox production from India.

 Due to the low stock position and the heavy cropping months expected only by July, the market for new season tea is expected to open on a strong note. There will be a strong domestic demand with most buyers requiring to replenish their stocks. Exporters are expected to be active from mid-May, which will increase competition.

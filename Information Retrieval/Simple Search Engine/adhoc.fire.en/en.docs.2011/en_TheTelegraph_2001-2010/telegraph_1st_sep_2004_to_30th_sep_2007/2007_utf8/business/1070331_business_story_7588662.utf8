 New Delhi, March 30: Commerce minister Kamal Nath today admitted in the presence of French trade minister Christine Laggard that Indias customs duties on imported wines and spirits were high and the situation would be corrected.

 Naths statement assumes significance in the wake of European Unions tough stand on the dispute at the World Trade Organisation.

 We recognise it is high. We are in talks, which are in an advanced stage. I believe this situation will be corrected, Nath said.

 French trade minister Christine Lagarde said France would like to see the duties come down.

 We would like to see more bottles of champagne, cognac and wines to be opened in India, she said.

 Nath said he was in talks with EU and French officials on the issue and would like Indian whisky to be allowed in Europe.

 Indian authorities have said they expect to resolve the dispute with a change in legislation on duties.

 The United States has also requested WTO consultations with India over what it calls excessive duties on wine and distilled spirits.

 A European spirits producers organisation has said EUs spirits exports to India were just 43 million euros ($57 million) in 2005 and wine exports were 7 million euros.

 An EU Commission report last year said a combination of import duties and taxes added up to a high of 550 per cent on imported spirits and 264 per cent on imported wines.

 The Indian government is likely to move a bill in Parliament next month to lower customs duty on imported wines and spirits in the wake of the stepped up pressure. This would also pave the way for cheaper retail prices of these beverages in the domestic market. 

 The finance ministry is expected to draw up a proposal which will soon be taken to the cabinet for approval. The bill is likely to come when Parliament meets after a three-week recess, according to a senior official.

 Chidambaram: Speaking his mind

 Chennai, March 11: Refuting the impression of the budget having nothing much for the urban population and the corporate sector, finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the focus on agriculture was not at the cost of manufacturing and services sectors. 

 He said industry and services are driving Indias economic growth and the manufacturing sector has also become a driver of growth along with the infotech industry and software exports. We have not squeezed any of them, Chidambaram said here at a meeting on the budget organised by the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC). 

 Stating that the corporate sector has been doing very well in the past couple of years and is showing good profits, Chidambaram cited recent figures to show that corporate tax as a proportion of the net profits of companies was not much. For instance, of the Rs 4,08,043-crore net profit posted in 2005-06 by 3,01,736 tax-paying companies, the corporate tax was only Rs 78,669 crore, he said. This implied that for every Rs 100 net profit earned by companies, only Rs 19.26 was paid as tax. Chidambaram heatedly asked, Whom are we squeezing?

 Moreover, the new cut-off norms for service tax payment in the Budget will exempt two lakh of the four lakh tax-paying small service providers, he pointed out. 

 Apart from the small rise in dividend distribution tax from 12.5 per cent to 15 per cent, no fresh burden has been imposed on these two sectors that have been significantly contributing to Indias growth story, claimed the finance minister.

 Saying he was pained by some of the media reactions to his budget, Chidambaram said with the UPA running a coalition in Delhi, the political context could not be ignored. It was under the guidance of the UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, and under the advice of the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that the budget had been prepared, he admitted.

 Bank NPA cut

 Chidambaram today exuded confidence that the average net non-performing asset (NPA) of public sector banks would come down to half a per cent within a short period.

 He said the net NPA of the banks was 1.3 per cent at present and it would be brought down to 1 per cent in the coming financial year. With the cooperation of borrowers, who are repaying loans, the NPA could be brought below half a per cent within a short period, he said.

 MindTree debuts with a bang 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 7: On a day when the stock exchanges witnessed huge volatility, there was one counter which bucked the trend MindTree Consulting. 

 The IT and R amp;D services company made a strong debut on the bourses, opening at Rs 599 on the BSE, a 41 per cent premium to its offer price, and ending the day at Rs 620.30, a gain of 46 per cent over the issue price of Rs 425 per share. 

 MindTree also led the BSE turnover charts as it beat heavyweight Reliance Industries to clock a turnover of Rs 554.34 crore. 

 Market observers said investors interest in the counter reflected their confidence not only in the business model of the company, but also its promoters, led by Ashok Soota, who was the vice-chairman of Wipro Ltd before he set up MindTree. 

 Investors flocked to the counter when the sensex swung 512 points before ending 117 points lower in volatile trading. 

 Brokers said despite the markets witnessing huge selling pressure during intra-day trading, the scrip managed to hold on to its gains. 

 On the NSE, the share opened at Rs 627 and shot up to an intra-day high of Rs 673.75, after which it closed at Rs 621.20. 

 MindTree is organised into two divisions: information technology services and research and development services. 

 IT services comprise strategic consulting, application development and maintenance, package implementation and product engineering services.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Q amp;A

 Missed the bus

 I invested Rs 30,000 in March 1996 in deep discount bonds, which were to mature in June 2006. Since we had to be away in Delhi when the bonds would mature, I had sent all the documents, including Form 15H and my bank details and PAN, to the registrar of the bonds, Kirloskar Computers, in April 2006. However, the issuer of the bonds, Krishna Bagya Jala Nigam, sent me the redemption money after deducting Rs 14,076 towards tax. Can they deduct tax even when I submitted Form 15H beforehand?

 S. Venkatachalam, Calcutta

 According to law, income tax has to be deducted at source on interest income as and when the interest is credited to the beneficiarys account. However, if form 15H is submitted before the interest is credited, TDS would not be deducted. You had submitted your Form 15H much after the Nigam had credited the interest to your account. Instead of April, the form should have been with the bank before March of every year, because that is when the bank would first credit the interest to your account every year. 

 Now you can claim the tax deducted from the income tax department. Submit the TDS certificate along with your income tax return. You can ask the Nigam or its registrar to send you the TDS certificate.

 Fixed deposits

 From the financial year 2006-07, investment up to Rs 1 lakh in bank fixed deposits of five years or more is eligible for deduction under section 80C. Can the deposit be an ordinary fixed deposit? How can one show the annual interest income from such deposits in ones income tax return?

 Subrata Kumar Chatterjee, Calcutta

 k fixed deposits, which qualify for deduction under section 80C, are not the regular fixed deposits. These are special tax saving fixed deposits which cannot be pledged for loans. 

 However, you can take out the interest on a quarterly or a monthly basis there is no restriction on that. You can show the annual interest income from such an investment as income from other sources in your income tax return. 

 However, if you choose the cumulative interest option, you can claim deduction under section 80C on the interest income shown as income from other sources. The treatment is similar as in case of interest income from NSC.

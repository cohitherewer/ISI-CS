 Calcutta, Aug. 25: A swelling subscriber base has made Bharti Airtel upbeat about the market potential of the east. 

 As of July this year, the Sunil Mittal company has 12.8 lakh subscribers in Calcutta, while Vodafone Essar, the market leader, has 14.6 lakh subscribers. 

 According to the Cellular Operators Association of India, the gap between the two rivals is now 1.8 lakh. This is for the first time in five years that the two companies are running neck and neck.

 Airtel has 25 lakh subscribers in the Calcutta and Bengal circles. We have added 15 lakh subscribers in Bengal and Calcutta in the past 15 months, said Ajai Puri, CEO mobility, Bharti Airtel, Bengal and Calcutta.

 In July last year, Airtels subscription numbers stood at 7 lakh and Hutch had 10.8 lakh subscribers. 

 The company invested around Rs 400 crore in Bengal and Calcutta in the first half of this fiscal and plans to do the same in the second half.

 Bharti has estimated its capital expenditure this fiscal at $3.5 billion (Rs 12,000 crore). Seventy per cent of the amount will be spent on mobility services.

 The eastern region Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and the Northeast is expected to be a major growth driver for Airtel in the next few years. Almost half of the companys market share came from the east in the previous fiscal.

 City campus

 The Bengal government is yet to approve the companys proposal to set up a campus in the city. We have been assured that around four to five acres will be handed over to us soon, Puri said.

 The company had asked for a plot in New Town, Rajarhat, to set up its campus.

 Airtel has also expanded outside Calcutta, setting up its second call centre in Durgapur in partnership with Hinduja TMT. 

 The centre employs around 400 people.

 The other call centre is managed by IBM Daksh and has 1,200 employees catering to post and prepaid customers.

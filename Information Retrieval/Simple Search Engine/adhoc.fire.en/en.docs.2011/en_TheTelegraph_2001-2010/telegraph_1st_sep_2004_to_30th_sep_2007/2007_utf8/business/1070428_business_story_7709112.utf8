 SBI alert on home loans

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhatt: Close watch

 Mumbai, April 27: The State Bank of India today cautioned against rising bad loans in the housing sector and said this could lead to an asset bubble in real estate.

 Non-performing assets in the home loan segment are rising, SBI chairman .P. Bhatt said, adding that it could spill over to other sectors such as commercial real estate and small amp; medium enterprises (SMEs).

 Bhatt was speaking on the sidelines of a conference organised by the Indian Merchants Chamber and Indian Banks Association here today.

 The SBI chairman, however, added that as of now there is no cause for concern, but there is definitely a cause to think, plan and act.

 Bhatt is the first among senior bankers to talk about the growing default on home loans. 

 Over the past 15-18 months, home loan rates have jumped 300-400 basis points, as the RBI has adopted monetary tightening measures to fight inflation. Some borrowers have seen a jump in their EMIs while for others, the tenure of their loans has gone up.

 Bhatt said home loan NPAs were higher by 0.5 percentage point at 4 per cent.

 The SBI expects the pace of credit growth to slow during the current financial year. The bank sees around 26 per cent rise in advances this fiscal, less than 28 per cent in 2006-07. Deposits are expected to rise 20 per cent compared with 16-17 per cent last year.

 According to Bhatt, there was no dearth of loans for viable projects. However, he felt, pricing could be an issue.

 Speaking at the function, RBI governor Y.V. Reddy said the central bank would like to align inflation in the economy with the rest of the world to strengthen the countrys financial sector.

 While the RBI had brought about greater flexibility in the forex market, the countrys current account deficit was manageable, Reddy added.

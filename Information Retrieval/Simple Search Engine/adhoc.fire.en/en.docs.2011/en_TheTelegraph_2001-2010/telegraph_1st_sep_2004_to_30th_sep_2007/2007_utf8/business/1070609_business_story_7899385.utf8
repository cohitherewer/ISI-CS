 Interest rate surge puts the brakes on auto sales

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 8: Rising interest rates have affected car and motorcycle sales in May. Car sales have slowed down to 9.07 per cent, while those of motorcycles have slumped by 16.36 per cent.

 Interest charged on auto-financing deals rose to 14.5 per cent in the month from 9.5 per cent last year. 

 Things are expected to get better soon. Car companies will offer combinations of special finance schemes and freebies to help push sales, said Arvind Saxena, vice-president marketing and sales, Hyundai Motors India Limited.

 Auto companies give special low interest rates and free insurance on certain cars to push sales.

 According to figures released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, 96,922 cars were sold in May against 88,863 a year ago.

 In April, 82,934 cars were sold compared with 74,542 in the corresponding month of the previous year, registering a growth of 11.25 per cent.

 Maruti Udyog Ltd has posted a 9.02 per cent growth in sales at 49,353 units against 45,267 in the same month last year. Hyundai Motors India sold 16,617 vehicles compared with 16,062 a year ago, registering a growth of 3.45 per cent.

 Tata Motors sales were down 6.8 per cent at 14,217 vehicles compared with 15,253 in May last year. 

 General Motors managed to escape the slump as its newly launched hatchback, the Spark, did reasonably well. The companys sales grew 95.62 per cent to 3,625 units from 1,853 in the corresponding month last year.

 However, the price-sensitive motorbike market was hit harder. Motorcycle sales in May were down 16.36 per cent at 477,901 units against 571,367 in the same month of the previous year. 

 Market analyst Sudipto Roy said, Usually people who are young and earn less buy motorcycles. Since they have limited income and savings, they tend to postpone purchase decisions with a price rise and wait for a better deal.

 TVS Motor Company and Bajaj Auto led the slide with 42 per cent and 25 per cent decline in sales, respectively. TVS Motor sold 41,724 motorcycles against 71,731 last year, while sales of Bajaj Auto stood at 129,724 units compared with 172,847. 

 Hero Honda also saw its sales dip 5.5 per cent. The company sold 269,532 bikes compared with 285,193 in May last year. Total two-wheeler sales during May declined 9.88 per cent to 606,187 units from 672,671 in the year-ago period.

 The scooter segment, however, did better. Sales increased 24.52 per cent with 92,048 units sold in May against 73,919 in the previous year.

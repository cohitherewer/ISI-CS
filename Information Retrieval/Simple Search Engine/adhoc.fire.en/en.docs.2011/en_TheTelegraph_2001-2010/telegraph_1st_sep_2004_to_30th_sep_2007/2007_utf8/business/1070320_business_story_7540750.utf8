 AIG outfit enters housing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 19: AIG Capital India, a wholly owned subsidiary of insurance and financial services firm American International Group Inc, will enter the housing finance business. It is acquiring a 100 per cent stake in Weizmann Homes Ltd (WHL), an associate company of the Rs 250-crore Weizmann group, for an undisclosed sum.

 Weizmann, with interest in housing finance, forex dealership, textile exports and consumer finance, will sell the entire stake in its housing finance arm to AIG Capital India in an all-cash deal. Weizmann now holds a 56.41 per cent stake in WHL. 

 This includes the 4 per cent equity that it acquired from associate companies during the financial year. 

 After the deal, AIG Capital India will retain 100 per cent control over WHL as it will buy the stakes of other shareholders as well.

 Earlier, AIG Capital India bought a controlling stake in Vivek Hire Purchase amp; Leasing Ltd, a non-banking finance company offering consumer finance, for an undisclosed sum.

 On the closing of the transaction, AIG Capital India acquired a 75 per cent ownership stake and management control of Vivek Hire Purchase and the promoters of Vivek Ltd retained 25 per cent.

 Vivek Hire Purchase is owned by the promoters of Vivek Ltd, a leading consumer durables retailer in India. The 75 per cent stake in Vivek Hire Purchase comes at a time when the group already has an approval to form an NBFC.

 In India, AIG is present in the insurance segment through a joint venture with the Tata group. The venture caters to both life and general segments. AIG is also planning to enter the asset management segment in India. 

 Last year, it roped in Ravi Mehrotra, former president of Franklin Templeton Investments, to establish the business and look into its overseas asset management initiatives in Asia.

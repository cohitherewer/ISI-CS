 Pearls of wisdom for retail industry

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 5: The retail industry mavens griped about the problems they faced power outages, high cost of land and service tax but if they were looking for some succour, they didnt get it.

 The success of organised retail cannot be judged by the bottomlines of the corporate houses, former Union power minister Suresh Prabhu told industrialists at the India Retail Forum today. Retailers, who complained about the power situation in states such as Maharastra, were told to find solutions through public-private partnerships.

 On a long-term basis, you need to involve the masses and create a win-win situation for both parties, Prabhu said. The retail industry should consider establishing captive power generation capacities in rural areas where there is plenty of biomass, he added.

 Power tariffs are so high in states such as Maharashtra, said Sumantra Banerjee, president and CEO, retail group, RPG Enterprise. Banerjee said the retail industry was being discriminated against as malls had to pay a higher tariff, which dented profits. The service tax is another deterrent, he added.

 Prabhu urged the retail industry not to look at their own growth but also consider building infrastructure. 

 The malls maybe great, but look at the roads that lead to the mall. A retailer must consider developing better infrastructure in and around their outlets, he added. 

 Most industry players believe the problems arise because the retail business has not been granted industry status. We dont even know which ministry we come under, whether it is the ministry of commerce or some other ministry. As a result we dont know whom to go to resolve the issues, added B.S. Nagesh, managing director of Shoppers Stop.

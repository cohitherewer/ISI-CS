 Ranbaxy to pick up 15% in Jupiter

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai/ New Delhi, April 6: Ranbaxy Laboratories is picking up around 14.9 per cent in the expanded capital of Jupiter Bioscience, a maker of specialised organic compounds. 

 The valuation of the deal has not yet been disclosed. 

 This is part of Ranbaxys product portfolio expansion through partnerships and strategic investments. The company will acquire up to 14.9 per cent of the enlarged capital of Jupiter Bioscience, Ranbaxy Laboratories chief executive officer and managing director Malvinder Singh told reporters today. 

 Jupiter Bioscience has also informed the stock exchanges that it plans to allot preferential equity share warrants to Ranbaxy. Jupiter will seek the approval for the proposal from its board of directors on April 12.

 Ranbaxy is likely to pick up this stake through warrants, which can later be converted into shares. The proposed warrant allotment is a part of the term sheet signed between the two companies earlier, which includes forging a strategic business tie-up on peptide pharmaceuticals for the global market, Jupiter said. 

 Peptides are combinations of amino acids that generate proteins. Apart from peptides, Jupiter Bioscience makes organic intermediates, speciality and fine chemicals. However, Ranbaxy is largely targeting peptides for its strategic alliance with Jupiter Bioscience as this fits into its pharmaceutical business.

 Formulated drugs or dosage forms contribute around 85 per cent of the global turnover of Ranbaxy Laboratories. The company has API facilities in Mohali and Toansa in Punjab.

 Ranbaxy had earlier picked up a significant stake in another API manufacturer, Krebs Biochemicals, when it acquired 10.50 lakh shares on a preferential basis.

 Jupiter Bioscience has a wholly owned US subsidiary, Jupiter Bioscience Inc, to cater to markets of peptides and peptide components in the US, Europe, Canada and Japan. 

 Earlier this year, the company had obtained shareholders approval to increase its authorised share capital from Rs 12 crore to Rs 20 crore.

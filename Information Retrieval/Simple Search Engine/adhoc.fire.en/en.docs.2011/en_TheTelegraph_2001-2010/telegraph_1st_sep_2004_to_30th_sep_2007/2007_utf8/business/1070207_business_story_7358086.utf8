 Calcutta, Feb. 6: Fortis HealthWorld, a joint venture between Ranbaxy Laboratories and Fortis Healthcare, today announced in New delhi it was setting up a retail health store chain having 1,000 shops in 400 towns by 2012.

 The stores would be one stop shops offering health products for the entire family, the company said. The stores will have prescription drugs, health supplements, health foods, alternate medicines, home and personal care products and a pathology lab collection centre.

 There will be a robust backend comprising a supply chain network of warehouses in each state, an IT infrastructure and bar codes for all products, including medicines.

 Unveiling the Fortis Healthworld logo, Malvinder Singh, CEO and MD of Ranbaxy Laboratories, said, We are entering the retail business and investing Rs 800 crore in the retail stores, covering over 400 towns. The launch of the chain of retail shops shows our clear intent and desire to bring healthcare closer to the people across the country on affordable prices. 

 Shivinder Singh, CEO and MD of Fortis, said, We are extending one more arm in the healthcare sector. There was a gap in this field as patients were looking for medicines, which are not spurious. We are providing them that place which is easily accessible. People need not go to a hospital for a blood test or to buy quality medicines.

 He said, The stores would run round the clock and offer customers value-added services such as prescription reminders, loyalty programmes, OPD appointments and free home delivery. 

 Shivinder said that besides allopathy medicines the stores would also provide homoeopathy and ayurvedic medicines as there was a demand for them.

 We will be putting all the products manufactured by other companies on competitive prices, he said.

 By the end of 2008, he said they will open 250 stores across India. Ashish Kirpal Pandit, who is the CEO of Fortis Healthworld, said employees would be trained, tested and certified.

 Ranbaxy pact

 Ranbaxy Laboratories today said it has entered into a multi-year research and development agreement with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to provide expanded drug-development responsibilities and more financial opportunities.

 The latest agreement expands the terms of Ranbaxy and GSKs strategic alliance established in 2003.

 The agreement presents a unique opportunity to demonstrate the India centric advantages of high quality research and development to deliver value at the cutting edge, Ranbaxy CEO and MD Malvinder Singh said.

 This expanded alliance envisages potential work in a wide range of therapeutics of interest to GSK including anti-infectives, metabolic, respiratory and oncology products, it added.

 Under the agreement, Ranbaxy would advance leads beyond candidate selection to completion of clinical proof of concept.

 After this GSK would conduct further clinical development for each program and rake resulting products through regulatory approvals for commercialisation, it added.

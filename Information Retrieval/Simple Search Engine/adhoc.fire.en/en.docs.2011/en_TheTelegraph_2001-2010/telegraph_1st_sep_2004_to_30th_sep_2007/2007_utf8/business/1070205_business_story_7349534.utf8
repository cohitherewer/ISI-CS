 Mobile mania sparks rush in handset retail

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 IN THE THICK OF ACTION

 Mumbai, Feb. 4: A host of telecom players are planning to enter the mobile handset retailing business in India.

 The Kishore Biyani-led Future Group and the Essar group are gearing up to tap the countrys huge potential. Indias teledensity stands at 17 per cent only.

 These companies have drawn up expansion plans, including an entry into non-metros. 

 Their rationale is simple. Even as the mobile subscriber base is growing at a robust pace, the wireless segment is set to grow exponentially due to rising per capita GDP. Moreover, network coverage is increasing and tariffs have become affordable.

 While the Future Group has made its presence felt through its Big Bazaar stores, the Ruias of Essar group have entered mobile phone retailing through their Mobile Store.

 Essar group sources said they have plans to open over 2,000 stores in the long-run. There is a buzz in the industry that these stores are a prelude to the group entering organised retailing. This is, however, denied by the company officials.

 Mobile Magic India Pvt Ltd, a start-up, has also drawn up plans for a retail chain of mobile shops in India.

 Its first outlet was launched in July 2004 in Nagpur. It now has 60 outlets in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat. 

 Mobile Magic CEO Vijay Singh told The Telegraph that by March, the company aims to set up 200 outlets. This is expected to go up to 500 in 2008.

 Research firm Motilal Oswal expects the wireless subscriber base in India, including fixed wireless phones, to touch 32.9 crore by 2008-09 and 38.3 crore by 2010, from the current subscriber base of 14 crore. 

 According to its recent report, while monthly net additions in the last 12 months have more than doubled from 3.7 million to 6.7 million, monthly net subscriber additions will continue to move up and touch 7 million by the end of 2006-07.

 While Mobile Magic is planning an initial public offer (IPO) issue by 2009, they want to be present in 3,400 towns by 2010.

 The annual sale of Mobile Magic handsets in states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Chattisgarh is now over 5 lakh. According to Singh, the company has adopted an innovative approach and the USP of Mobile Magic is not to merely focus on handset sales. The company is concentrating on the technology and services related to mobile phones. 

 It offers other services such as multi-branded accessories, application download (songs, film clips and games), servicing and bundling the handsets by selling prepaid and postpaid connections of all the service providers.

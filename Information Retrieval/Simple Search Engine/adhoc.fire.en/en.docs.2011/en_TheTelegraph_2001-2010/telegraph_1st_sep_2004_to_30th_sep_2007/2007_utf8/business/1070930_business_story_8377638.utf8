 Whiff of gas deal

 Tehran, Sept. 29 (Reuters): Pakistan has agreed to the details of a deal for buying gas from Iran, officials from both sides said on Friday, adding that the proposed tri-nation pipeline would be viable even if India, the third party, walked out.

 India stayed away from this weeks talks in Tehran on the proposed $7-billion pipeline, saying it wanted to agree on transit costs through Pakistan on a bilateral basis first, an Iranian official said. But he said India had not said it was quitting.

 The economics of the project will improve with Indian participation but ... the project is economically viable as a bilateral project also, Mukhtar Ahmed, energy adviser to Pakistans Prime Minister, told reporters in Tehran.

 Hojjatollah Ghanimifard, international affairs director of the National Iranian Oil Company, said the three sides had previously planned for gas sale and purchase agreements to be negotiated separately by India and Pakistan.

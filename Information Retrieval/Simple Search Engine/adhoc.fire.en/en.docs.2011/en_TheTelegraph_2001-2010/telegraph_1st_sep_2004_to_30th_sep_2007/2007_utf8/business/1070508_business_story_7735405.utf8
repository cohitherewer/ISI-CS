 DPSC makeover to help customers

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, May 7: Come 2009, consumers of DPSC Ltd, formerly Dishergarh Power Supply Company, will not only get a steady supply of good quality power but may also pay less for the energy consumed.

 The company will set up two plants of 250 mw each at Dishergarh power station where an 87-year-old generation unit now stands. The old plant will be dismantled and the units will be installed in its place, said S. Radhakrishnan, managing director of DPSC Ltd.

 Dishergarh power station is built on a 30-acre plot and we will acquire another 60 acres in adjoining areas for the two plants. We will invite global tenders to set up the plants and supply equipment, Radhakrishnan said.

 DPSC will also appoint merchant bankers to look into all aspects of the project, including financing options. Merchant bankers will be appointed by the end of May, after which tenders will be floated, he added.

 The capacity addition of 500 mw will require an investment of Rs 2,000 crore, of which the debt component will be Rs 1,400 crore and the remaining will be equity. We will explore all options, including a public issue, Radhakrishnan said.

 The firm plans to start the project next January. It is, therefore, expected to come out with a public issue, if any, before the end of this year.

 The two plants will help DPSC lower its average cost of power generation and sell electricity to end-consumers at a lower price.

 Our existing plant is too old and is currently generating 8-9 mw against the installed capacity of 12 mw. Consequently, our average cost of power generation has gone up over the years. The increase in the generation capacity will help us reduce the cost significantly, Radhakrishnan said.

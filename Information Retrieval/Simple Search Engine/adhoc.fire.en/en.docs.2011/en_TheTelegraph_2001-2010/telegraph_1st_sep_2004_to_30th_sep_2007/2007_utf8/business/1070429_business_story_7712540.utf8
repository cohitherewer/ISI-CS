 Income tax returns made simpler

 Chidambaram: New way

 New Delhi, April 28: The finance ministry has decided to introduce a simpler income tax return form for the assessment year 2007-08 in place of last years form 2F, which left many annoyed as it sought details of personal expenditure.

 The government has scrapped controversial questions on flow of funds and has designed two versions of form ITR-1 instead. One version has two pages and the other three. The Centre expects one of them will be accepted as a replacement for the Saral form. 

 When we proposed some draft forms earlier, there were concerns about a column on cash flow statement. We have taken a fresh look at that. We have decided to withdraw the column, finance minister P. Chidambaram said here today. 

 Form 2F had a column on cash-flow statement where taxpayers were supposed to give their opening balance and closing balance, loans taken and approximate expenditures planned for the year.

 We will ask for opinions from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Whichever form they select will be accepted ... We will also listen to suggestions from the public, officials added. 

 The ITR-1 is, however, considered more technical than Saral and asks taxpayers to fill in a column on the basis of Form 16 they used to attach earlier. The information that was attached in Form 16 is being sought in this form to make it machine-readable and easier for e-filing, said Sudatta Sengupta, a senior chartered accountant. 

 Other chartered accountants, however, felt that the form was slightly technical and could require help from income tax experts to fill in ... Saral was not simple, but this one is not as well.

 Chidambaram said governments tax collection had soared to Rs 4,70,077 crore, exceeding the revised revenue estimates for 2006-07 by about Rs 5,000 crore.

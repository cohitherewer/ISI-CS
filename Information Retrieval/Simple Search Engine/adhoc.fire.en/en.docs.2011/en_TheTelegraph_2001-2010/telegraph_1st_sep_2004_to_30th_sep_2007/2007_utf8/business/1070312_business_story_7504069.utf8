The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 IOC keen to join retail club

 S.P.S. PANNU

 In a new Avatar

 New Delhi, March 11: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is following in the footsteps of Reliance and Bharti for a full-fledged foray into retail. The oil PSU which has convenience stores at many of its filling stations has hired Technopak for a feasibility study on the project.

 A senior IOC official told The Telegraph that the Fortune 500 company is keen on leveraging its brand in organised retail. If the Technopak study finds the business a viable option, the downstream oil company will go beyond its existing Convenio stores at its filling stations.

 We will consider moving into shopping malls and could go in for tie-ups with leading builders to get good space, the official said. 

 IOC had reservations about diversifying into non-fuel retail as it is unrelated to its area of core competence. However, global oil firms such as British Petroleum (BP) have ventured into organised retail, emboldening the Indian company to take the plunge.

 Reliance Industries is now fully into organised retail as is private sector telecom player Bharti Enterprises, which has drawn up plans for the segment in collaboration with US-based Wal-Mart. IOC has the acumen to take on these companies in the domestic retail space but wants to be sure of the profitability of the venture. 

 Some consumer durable companies are interested in tie-ups with IOC to market their products through its petrol pumps.

 Technopak has already done studies on retail for some private sector companies.

 Shopping malls are now common in large cities, and at least 150 new malls will come up by 2008.

 The organised sector accounts for only 2 to 4 per cent of the total market. This is expected to rise by 20 to 25 per cent on a year-on-year basis.

 Retail growth rate in the next five years is expected to be stronger than the GDP growth rate, driven by changing lifestyles and high income. Favourable demographic patterns and rising levels of consumer credit are also expected to boost consumer demand.

 To cash in on this demand, companies have lined up investments in the retail sector. For instance, Bharti plans to invest $2.5 billion (around Rs 11,250 crore) in retail and expects revenues of $4.5 billion (Rs 20,250 crore) from the business by 2015. According to Rajan Bharti Mittal, joint managing director of the company, retail would be the big focus of Bharti in the next eight years. 

 Bharti is keen on stores of all formats hypermarkets, supermarkets and others in cities with a population of more than a million to sell an array of items ranging from groceries, clothing, furniture to electronic goods.

 Study for expansion of MF reach

 New Delhi, June 24 (pti): Mutual fund companies should offer affordable products in the rural and sub-urban areas to sustain the growth in the long run, a joint study by cii and PricewaterhouseCoopers has said. 

 Tapping the rural market is likely to be a big challenge for mutual fund companies. The fund houses need to offer products that are affordable as well as competitive against low-risk and assured returns of government-sponsored saving schemes, the study said.

 It recommended the fund houses to tap on savings of retail investors by meeting basic requirements such as retirement planning and child education. The study also suggested leveraging on the growth prospects of commodity and real estate markets.

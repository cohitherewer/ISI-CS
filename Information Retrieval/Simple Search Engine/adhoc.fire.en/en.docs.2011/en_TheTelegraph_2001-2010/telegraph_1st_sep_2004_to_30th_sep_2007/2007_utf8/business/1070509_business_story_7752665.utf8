 PC pill to check inflation

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, May 8: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the measures taken by the government would bring down the inflation rate but the long-term solution to the problem lies in correcting the demand-supply mismatch in essential commodities. 

 Production of wheat, paddy and pulses has to be stepped up to solve the problem. The rate of inflation, measured by wholesale prices, was 5.77 per cent for the week ended April 21. The rate has slowed down from a two-year high of 6.7 per cent in January.

 The central bank has raised its lending rate by 125 basis points to 7.75 per cent since June last year and the government has cut duties on a number of items, including edible oils and cement, to fight inflation.

 Chidambaram said the central banks monetary steps were aimed at maintaining price stability without hurting growth.

 In its April policy review, the central bank said it hopes to bring down inflation to 5 per cent by March 2008, while the medium-term target was 4.0-4.5 per cent.

 The demand-supply gap in wheat, pulses and edible oils, hardening of international prices of metals and crude oil, a rapid rise in credit, buoyant foreign investments and a high growth momentum have pushed up the inflation rate, said Chidambaram.

 The economy has grown by 9.2 per cent in the financial year ended March 2007, powered by a double-digit growth in manufacturing and services.

 Chidambaram said India requires large foreign inflows as well as domestic investment to sustain high growth rates. 

 Moreover, infrastructure inadequacies are hurting growth, he said.

 Retail FDI

 The government has not taken any decision to allow foreign direct investment in the retail sector, Chidambaram said.

 FDI is only permitted for cash and carry, wholesale and single brand retail, he said.

 On FDI investments, Chidambaram said inflows of $13.5 billion during 2006-07 were the highest-ever and if retained earning and a swap deal were to be included, the FDI during the period would be $19 billion. 

 He said a investment ratio of 28-32 per cent of GDP was required to sustain high growth. The UPA government had achieved an investment ratio of over 33 per cent of GDP during 2005-06.

 The finance minister said measures will be taken during the current five-year plan to ensure that the $320 billion needed for infrastructure is raised.

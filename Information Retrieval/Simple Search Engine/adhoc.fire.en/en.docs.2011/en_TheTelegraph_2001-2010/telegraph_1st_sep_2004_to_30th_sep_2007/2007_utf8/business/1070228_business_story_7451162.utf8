 Holcim holding in Ambuja Cements up

 High Stakes

Mumbai, Feb. 27: Holcim, the global cement giant, has raised its stake in Ambuja Cements India Pvt Ltd (ACIL) to 78 per cent for Rs 526.5 crore. 

 The move could indirectly raise the companys interest in Associated Cement Companies (ACC) as ACIL has a 35 per cent stake in the latter. 

 The company will pick up these shares as Gujarat Ambuja Cements (GACL) has acted on a put option clause with regard to its 33 per cent holding in ACIL. 

 GACL today announced it has exercised its put option on Holcim for its investment in ACIL. 

 While GACL held 33 per cent in ACIL, the company added it has exercised the option for 11 per cent of its holding. GACL sold over 9.53 crore shares of ACIL for Rs 526.5 crore. 

 By selling these shares, GACL realised a profit of Rs 240.7 crore. The company added that after this sale, it owns 22 per cent in ACIL, while Holcim owns 78 per cent. This acquisition comes only a day after Holcim made a bid for a company in Canada in which it already has a majority stake. It is expected that Holcim will purchase the remaining 22 per cent stake in ACIL over the next one year. 

 The announcement led to ACC shares finishing 1.60 per cent higher on the BSE. It ended at Rs 961.05 after opening at Rs 950 and rising to an intra-day high of Rs 965. 

 Holcim has been strengthening its hold in India over the past few months. 

 In November last year, it acquired 5 crore shares or 3.7 per cent from entities controlled by GACLs founder promoters in the company. 

 The purchase took its holding to 18.5 per cent. These shares were acquired from RKBK Fiscal Services Pvt Ltd and Radha Madhav Investments. 

 Close to 1.65 crore shares were bought by Holderind Investments at a price of Rs 137 per share and 3.35 crore shares were acquired from Radha Madhav at the same price. While Holcim paid Rs 685 crore, the deal price was 32 per cent higher than the Rs 105 per share that the Swiss company paid the Sekhsarias and Neotias when it bought 14.8 per cent in GACL in early 2006. 

 In 2005, Holcim entered into a strategic alliance with GACL and took over the majority in ACIL. Through this local holding company, Holcim acquired a majority in Ambuja Cement Eastern Ltd (ACEL) and a substantial stake in ACC.

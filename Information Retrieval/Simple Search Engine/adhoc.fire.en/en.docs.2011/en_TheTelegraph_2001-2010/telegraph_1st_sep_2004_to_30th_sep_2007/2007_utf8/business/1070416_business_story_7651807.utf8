 Commodity exchange offers tips to small farmers

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA 

 Calcutta, April 15: The Multi Commodity Exchange of India Limited (MCX) is raising awareness among the small cotton farmers of Gujarat on the benefits of futures trading.

 The move is aimed at offsetting the risks in commodity trading faced by the farmers.

 This is a learning step for us. If successful, we will extend this model to other plantation crops which are traded on the exchange, such as cardamom, rubber, and coffee, MCX chief economist Shunmugham pointed out by e-mail.

 The Rangachari task force had suggested encouraging small growers to take part in the futures market. It had recommended literacy programmes to spread the concept of futures trading among farmers. 

 The panel also called for the formation of cooperatives to enable farmers to participate in commodity trading.

 Derivatives trading and options now exist in pepper, cardamom, chillies, coffee, natural rubber, coconut oil and copra. 

 To improve the information network, a commodity exchange is planning to digitally link all the agriculture produce market committees (APMCs) in Maharashtra. The exchange may later expand this to all other APMCs in the country. 

 These commodity information centres will provide farmers with national spot and futures commodity prices on a real-time basis. This means that even small farmers can now access the latest prices. Small growers benefit indirectly from futures trading as the terminals help in a nationwide price discovery mechanism. These terminals give information to the farmers and help them take the right decisions. 

 For example, initially for cardamom, there was a huge price difference between the realised price for the farmer and the end price for the consumer. Negotiations through such satellite terminals have resulted in indirectly raising the price realisation for the small farmer.

 Some plantation crops have a dominance of small growers. Coffee leads the list with 10.12 hectares under small growers. 

 Around 20 per cent of the Indian tea market, which could join the futures trading soon, also show a presence of the small growers.

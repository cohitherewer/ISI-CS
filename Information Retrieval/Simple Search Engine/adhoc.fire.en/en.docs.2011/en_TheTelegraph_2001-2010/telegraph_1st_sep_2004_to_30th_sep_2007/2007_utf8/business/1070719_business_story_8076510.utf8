 Calcutta, July 18: The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) will set up a non-banking finance company for its micro-finance foray. 

 The new company will be called Nabard Financial Services (Nabfins) and will have an authorised capital of Rs 100 crore.

 Nabard will own a 51 per cent stake in Nabfins, while the remaining 49 per cent will be shared with some commercial banks and financial institutions. 

 Canara Bank has expressed an interest in picking up a stake in Nabfins. We are also in talks with a few others, Nabard chairman and managing director Y.S.P. Thorat said on the sidelines of a banking conclave organised by the eastern regional council of Ficci. 

 Nabfins will lend in remote areas at a much lower cost than that charged by other micro-finance institutions. 

 Nabfins will put an end to the wrong perceptions about the micro-finance business. It will set an example of how micro-financing can be done at a lower cost and in a transparent manner. It will give other institutions a run for their money, Thorat said. Nabfins will disburse Rs 100 crore to Rs 150 crore on an incremental basis every year. We have enough money to refinance the companys advances, he added.

 Nabard will also set up an advisory unit for counselling on credit and other financial services. 

 The government is also setting up two funds in line with the recommendations of the Rangarajan Committee to extend banking and financial services to remote areas.

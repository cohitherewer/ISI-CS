 Tatas bet on Tetley rerun in Corus

 Gateway to success

 The Tata-Corus deal has already been analysed threadbare and the markets opinion clearly is that Tata has overpaid. Theres no guarantee, however, that the market is always right. Markets usually take a rather short-term view while, as Ratan Tata pointed out, businesses are for the long-run.

 Perhaps one way of understanding the deal is to see how the groups other acquisitions are faring. Lets take Tata Steel first. Millennium Steel, now called Tata Steel (Thailand), has already turned around and the company, which was in the red in the first quarter of last year, has returned to profitability. That doesnt seem to have helped the stock much, though you could put that down to lower steel prices.

 But its debatable whether Tata Steels subsidiaries are pulling their weight. In the nine months to end-December 2006, for instance, while Tata Steels standalone operations contributed 70 per cent to the topline of the consolidated operations, its contribution to operating profits was much higher, at 92.5 per cent. The saving grace is that this proportion was even higher the previous year, so you could make a case that the subsidiaries are improving. So far, theyve proved a drag on the bottomline, but you could again argue that its the long-term potential that counts and the short-term pain is well worth the foothold in the growing Asean markets. Unfortunately, Europe is not a growth market, so you really cant use that argument for Corus.

 Next, consider Tata Motors Daewoo acquisition. For the nine months to end-December 2006, Tata Daewoos turnover as well as its profits rose by around 46 per cent. Profits have been under pressure in the last quarter because export volumes have gone up while the Korean won has appreciated, which has impacted the bottomline. But thats not Tatas fault. You also have to take into account access to superior technology.

 But the really comparable deal, in the sense of a much smaller company taking over a large one and also Tatas biggest acquisition before the Corus win, is the Tetley acquisition. Its actually rather different from the Corus deal, though, because buying Tetley was necessary to transform Tata Tea from being a plantation company to becoming a global brand. The Corus deal offers no such qualitative transformation, although its certainly a quantitative one.

 Nevertheless, how has Tetley performed? Well, heres what a study by European business school Insead said, After a difficult first year, which saw the closure of a production facility, EBIT for 2001-2002 is 24 per cent over the year prior, and EBT is 90 per cent higher, while Tetleys market share is at an all-time high of 25 per cent in the US and 40 per cent in Canada. By 2004, Tetleys debt-equity ratio came down to 1.3:1 from 3:1 at the time of acquisition and its earnings before interest, tax and depreciation was 46 million against 28 million at the time of the acquisition. Refinancing in 2005 completed the process.

 The market, however, didnt take very kindly to the Tetley deal. Taking the stock data from end-January 2000 (Tetley was acquired in February 2000), the Tata Tea stock steadily lost ground and even by February 2005, it was only 12 per cent above its January 2000 level. The sensex was around 27 per cent higher. The stock has been an underperformer, although the uncertainties surrounding the Glaceau deal have also been responsible. The market hates uncertainty.

 The other big difference is that the extent of debt that Corus will pick up requires steel prices to remain high. But after peaking last year, European steel prices are under pressure, thanks to Asian imports that offset production discipline by local manufacturers. That will mean equity dilution, not a prospect the market appreciates.

 Does market performance mean a great deal to the Tatas? To answer that question, you have to ask whether Tata Teas underperformance has affected its plans. Clearly, it hasnt it has gone ahead and acquired Good Earth, Eight clock and now Glaceau. 

 The group has enough muscle not to be too bothered about the market. Investors, of course, will take a very different view.

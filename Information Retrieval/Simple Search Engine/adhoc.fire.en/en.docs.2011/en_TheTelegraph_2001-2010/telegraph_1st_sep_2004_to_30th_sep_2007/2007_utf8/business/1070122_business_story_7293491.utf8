 Q amp;A

 Ready reckoner

 Could you kindly provide us with a ready-reckoner for calculation of interest on NSCs purchased earlier?

 Nirmal Kumar Biswas, Sonarpur

 The maturity value of every Rs 100 invested in an NSC is given on the certificates itself. The interest accumulates every six months. So, you can calculate your annual interest amount from this.

 Short-term gains

 If I switch from one equity scheme to another of a mutual fund within one year, will it be treated as a short-term capital gains (loss)? If the total period of holding of the two funds together is more than one year, can the transaction be treated as long-term capital gains (loss)?

 D. Roy, Calcutta

 Yes, such a transaction will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss and you will have to pay tax accordingly.

 Black and white

 I am an income tax assessee. My annual investment in PF, PPF and LIC (except NSC) will exceed the tax rebate limit of Rs 1 lakh in 2006-07. If I dont show and claim tax deduction on these investments in future, would it be a deviation on my part in I-T declaration?

 Arup Bose, 24 Parganas

 Yes. If you do not show in future your interest income from those investments, it will become black money. One will have to show your annual income from all sources in your income tax return.

 Post office whims

 I invested Rs 70,000 in the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme in 2004. The Salkia post office declined to accept Form 15H for non-deduction of tax at source for investors beyond 60 years of age. Can this be done?

 Ajit Kumar Das, Howrah

 The finance ministry has clarified in a notice in June last year that agency banks and post offices of the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme must accept Form 15H or Form 15G for non-deduction of tax at source on interest payable under this scheme.

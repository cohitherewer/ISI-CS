 Cong directs, PC acts

 - Party pitch: Junk gold amp; silver, focus on onion amp; potato

 Sonia Gandhi, Ahmed Patel

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: No hurrahs, no apologies. No celebrations, no lamentations.

 A day after the twin defeats in Uttarakhand and Punjab, the sense of relief in the Congress was palpable P. Chidambarams budget had kept in mind its sentiments and expectations.

 To that extent, it is neither Chidambaram nor Manmohan Singhs budget, it is the Congress and Sonia Gandhis budget, said B.K. Hari Prasad, the partys general secretary.

 For one, the budget is reticent on GDP and growth rate, phrases synonymous with Chidambaram and the Prime Minister, and expansive on issues close to Sonias heart: Bharat Nirman, the midday meal and rural employment guarantee schemes, targeted public distribution, minorities, women and, most important, the promise to maintain price stability.

 In the normal course, the Congress might have dismissed Chidambarams document with a ritualistic endorsement at its routine press briefing. But the crisis-ridden party treated the finance bill as a virtual second edition of the United Progressive Alliances common minimum programme, notwithstanding the Lefts criticism.

 Highly-placed Congress sources said since inflation was in the public domain and the early warning bells were sounded by the defeat in the Maharashtra civic elections, Chidambaram was told discreetly that he would have to pull up his socks and stop thinking of just the market and industry.

 When prices still continued to spiral, the Congress Working Committee, the partys top decision-making body, piled on him.

 At the last meeting on February 21, which took place against the backdrop of the Uttar Pradesh developments, Chidambaram was specially invited to brief the members on price rise.

 The sources said his explanation of global oil price trends and a mild decline in the cost of gold and silver cut no ice. A senior functionary, close to Sonia, cut him short and said: Lets stop talking of gold and silver and discuss onions and potatoes.

 The finance minister reportedly took his cue. 

 At the core committee meetings that followed, Sonia and her political secretary Ahmed Patel conveyed to the Prime Minister and Chidambaram that the budget would have to announce big deals for the social sector (health, education), agriculture, the marginalised populations and the Northeast.

 Unlike the past two years, Chidambaram had no structured meetings with the Congress, UPA allies, Left and the trade unions. Our brief was straight and clear. The years 2007 and 2008 were dry runs for the general election and we had enough of reforms, growth rates and the NDAs India Shining stuff. It was time to turn to the people, said a senior member.

 Today, he said: We are happy that industry and the market have not reacted positively. The budget is for the poor and the farmers and not these people.

 The announcements that specially gladdened the Congress were: 4 per cent growth rate in agriculture envisaged by the 11th five-year plan (for a change, there is no mention of only manufacturing, remarked Hari Prasad); ensuring access to basic physical infrastructure, higher education cess and a package for the minorities, including a larger contribution to the National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation, a Rs 108-crore scheme for multi-sector development in minority-dominated districts, and enhanced allocations for scholarships for minority students.

 For the CPM, the budget was a disappointment.

 In a statement, the partys politburo said: The budget fails to seriously address the problems of unemployment and inflation.

 The CPMs other complaints were it had not used the opportunities for more tax mobilisation, allocation to the crisis-hit farm sector was poor, and opportunities to tax capital were missed.

 The CPMs criticism was neutralised by the support the budget got from the UPA allies. The budget is in favour of the poor and backward sections. It will help the governments effort to check price rise, said RJD boss Lalu Prasad.

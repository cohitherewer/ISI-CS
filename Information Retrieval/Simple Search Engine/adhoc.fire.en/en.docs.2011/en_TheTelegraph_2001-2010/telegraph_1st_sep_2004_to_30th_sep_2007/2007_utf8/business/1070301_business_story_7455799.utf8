 Diabetes 

out of polio shadow

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi, Feb. 28: Diabetes and stroke finally got their due by the side of HIV and polio as the Union budget today increased the health-care allocation by 34 per cent.

 Lifestyle diseases accounted for a meagre part of the Rs 15,291-crore outlay, yet the Rs 50 crore set aside for them marked almost a six-fold hike from last years Rs 7.5 crore.

 The increased sum earmarked for the national programme for prevention of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and stroke and a tobacco control programme is a good beginning, public health experts said. 

 But they added that the amount was not large enough to be able to have a substantial impact on the rising graph of lifestyle-related diseases.

 Its a signal that the government is responding, but its not adequate to tackle the large and rapidly rising burden of such diseases, said K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India.

 The budget also proposes a 100 per cent increase in a project to upgrade life-saving facilities at trauma centres in towns along the nations highways an outlay of Rs 68 crore for 2007-08 over Rs 34 crore in the previous year.

 The finance minister named HIV/AIDS and polio as the biggest challenges in the health-care sector, raising the allocation for the National Rural Health Mission to Rs 9,947 crore from the current fiscals Rs 8,207 crore.

 The mission seeks to boost health-care services in rural areas through the appointment of social health activists and fresh investments.

 Chidambaram said the government had brought HIV/AIDS out of the closet. The outlay for the AIDS control programme for 2007-08 is Rs 969 crore.

 The budget provides for Rs 1,290 crore for the campaign to immunise children against polio. An unexpected rise in polio cases last year had prompted the government to intensify the campaign.

 Chidambaram said the stress will be on mother and child care and preventing and treating communicable diseases like tuberculosis and malaria.

 But the allocation for the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) a key programme for the welfare of children and pregnant or nursing mothers would not make experts and voluntary workers happy. It has been raised by just 15 per cent.

 Nobel laureate Amartya Sen had met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with a team of activists and discussed the poor implementation of the ICDS because of lack of resources.

 Legal tiff over idle land for SEZ

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Tough poser

 New Delhi, Aug. 5: The Union commerce minister has asked the attorney-general to give his opinion on a prickly question: what is the precise definition of vacant industrial land that can be turned into a special economic zone (SEZ)?

 The strange poser flows out of an investigation carried out by the revenue departments Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC).

 Essar Steels planned SEZ at Hazira has come under scrutiny after the CBEC told the commerce ministry that its enquiries revealed that the land occupied by the SEZ was not vacant land on December 3, 2005, the date on which the Ruias filed their application for permission to establish such a zone.

 The revenue departments contention is that some amount of money had already been spent on piling, erection, and fabrication before Essar applied for permission to turn the land adjoining an existing steel complex into an SEZ.

 The SEZ rules, which were notified in February 2006, stipulate that these zones can be set up only on vacant and contiguous land.

 In a letter to the commerce minister, Essar Steel has said that when it filed its application in December 2005, the rules did not carry such a stipulation. Ergo, its application should be cleared.

 It also raised the point that vacant land would legally mean that the developer held the title to the land.

 The letter also argues that in an SEZ that will eventually house a Rs 12,000-crore steel plant and several downstream industries, a small expenditure of Rs 60 crore on piling till November 2005 could not be taken to mean that the land was being used for any economic activity.

 The commerce ministry had been under attack in the past from the department of revenue, which feels the SEZ policy can lead to huge revenue leakages, and even more importantly, the transfer of projects meant for the domestic tariff area to SEZs.

 The government cleared Essars SEZ at Hazira on June 21, 2006, after an inspection, which took note of the structures but decided that this did not violate its policy. Essar consequently completed the installation of its processing plant and commissioned it on October 21, 2006.

 However, the revenue department has argued that the SEZ in question is not coming up on land that was vacant. It also holds that the company decided to set up the steel plant before the SEZ Act came into being in August 2005.

 Caught in the crossfire, the commerce ministry has tossed the ball to the attorney-general, seeking his opinion on what constitutes vacant land for the purpose of notifying SEZs, i.e. whether the term refers to barren land.

 The legal opinion will not only decide the fate of the Essar SEZ but will also become a precedent of sorts for other industrial houses that have vacant land with unfinished or even abandoned structures and want to convert them into SEZs.

 An Essar spokesperson said the company has fully complied with all laws, including those related to SEZs. 

 The company has paid all duties payable under the applicable law both under domestic tariff area and SEZ rules. 

 The company is cooperating and would continue to cooperate with the authorities, the spokesperson added.

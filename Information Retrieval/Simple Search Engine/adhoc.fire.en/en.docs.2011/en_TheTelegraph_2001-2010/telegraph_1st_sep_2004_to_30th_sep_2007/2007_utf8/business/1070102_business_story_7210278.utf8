 Sedans fuel China auto export surge

 Hard at work

 Beijing, Jan. 1 (PTI): China, aiming to capture 10 per cent of the global auto market, has exported a record 3.4 lakh units in 2006, the ministry of commerce (MoC) said here today.

 Sedan exports topped 90,000 units, a 200 per cent increase on the previous year, said an MoC official.

 Customs statistics show that Chinas vehicle exports surged 120 per cent from 78,000 units in 2004 to 173,000 units in 2005, with export value hitting $1.58 billion.

 China is aiming to lift the value of its vehicle and auto parts exports to $120 billion, or 10 per cent of the worlds total vehicle trading volume in the next decade, vice-minister of commerce Wei Jianguo said.

 Over the past few years, Chinas exports of vehicles and parts have grown rapidly. In 2005, exports reached $10.9 billion, an increase of 34 per cent on the previous year. 

 According to analysts, China was expected to produce and sell more than seven million units in 2006 and overtake Germany to become the worlds third largest automobile producer.

 Supported by favourable government policies, Chinas automobile industry is expected to forge ahead in 2007, Xinhua news agency reported.

 However, Wei noted that Chinas exports of vehicles and auto parts made up only 0.7 per cent of the worlds total vehicle trading volume. 

 To prevent domestic car makers getting into cut throat competition and also to weed out companies that are too small to be serious exporters, China has decided to establish export quotas for 2007. 

 Bank takeover

 Chinas largest bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) has signed an agreement with Indonesian lender Bank Halim to acquire a 90 per cent stake in the latter, the bank announced here today. 

 An announcement on the ICBC website said the remaining 10 per cent stake will continue to be held by shareholders of Bank Halim, but the ICBC has the option to buy it in three years. 

 This is the first time for the ICBC to take over a foreign bank, and is also the first time for the bank to enter an overseas market via acquisition, which would produce valuable experience for the bank to expand in the international financial market, the bank said. 

 The two banks have to wait for permission from their respective regulatory authorities before they can finalise the deal.

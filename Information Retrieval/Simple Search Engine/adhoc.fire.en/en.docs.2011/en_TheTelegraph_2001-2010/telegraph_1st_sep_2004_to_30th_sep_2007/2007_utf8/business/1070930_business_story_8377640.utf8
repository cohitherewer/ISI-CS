 Coal India arm to jack up output

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 29: Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL) aims to produce 78mt coal per annum by 2012 compared with 44mt at present. The Coal India subsidiary will take up two big projects at Magadh and Amrapali to achieve this target. It plans to produce 20mt and 12mt annually at Magadh and Amrapali, respectively.

 The department of public enterprises is expected to give a mini ratna status to CCL next week. 

 The company will also develop smaller mines with a capacity of 3-4mt at Konar, Karo and North Urimari. It will expand the capacities of the Ashoka and Piparwar mines to 10mt each by next year from 6.5mt, said R.P. Ritolia, chairman and managing director of CCL.

 CCL will invest Rs 2,500 crore during the Eleventh Five Year Plan to boost production. 

 For the big projects, the company will invite investors who will provide technology and equipment. Coal will be produced according to a target set by CCL. Investors will be paid on the basis of per tonne coal produced. 

 CCL will also use the highwall technology to produce coal from exhausted open cast mines. CCL and South Eastern Coalfields have already floated global tenders for highwall mining, Ritolia said. Mines in the US produce 20-30mt coal annually by using this technology.

 Mining meet

 China will partner India in the second Asian Mining Congress being organised by the Mining, Geological and Metallurgical Institute of India. The meet will be held in Calcutta from January 17-19 next year.

 China develops and manufactures the equipment and technology for underground mining. India too needs to produce more coal through underground mining, said R.P. Ritola, president of the institute.

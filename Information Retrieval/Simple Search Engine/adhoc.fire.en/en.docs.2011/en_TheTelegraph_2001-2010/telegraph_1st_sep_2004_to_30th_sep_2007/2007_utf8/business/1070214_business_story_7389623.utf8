 CLB adjourns hearing on Birla Corp 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: The Company Law Board has adjourned the hearing of the case filed by the minority shareholders of Birla Corporation against the R.S. Lodha-led management to the second week of May.

 The petitioners, who have sought changes to their original petition against the companys management, have also demanded a probe into the shareholding pattern of the late M.P. Birlas company.

 During the proceedings last week, CLB chairman S. Balasubramanian said he was not going to pass any order on the amendment petition as he would first look at the maintainability of the original petition.

 The board also said if the original petition was not maintainable, the amendment petition would also be turned down.

 Some shareholders of Birla Corporation, supported by the Birla family, have challenged Lodhas control over the assets of the MP Birla group, and filed a petition questioning resolutions passed in the September 15, 2004 annual general meeting.

 In the AGM, Lodha and two other members of his camp P. Majumdar and Vikram Swarup were elected as directors in the board of Birla Corporation. This AGM was supervised by the CLB itself.

 According to the Lodha camp, the petition is not maintainable as minority shareholders had approached the CLB after the AGM was held.

 They also added that the petition was filed with clear mala fide intentions as shares were allotted to these shareholders only after the death of Priyamvada Birla.

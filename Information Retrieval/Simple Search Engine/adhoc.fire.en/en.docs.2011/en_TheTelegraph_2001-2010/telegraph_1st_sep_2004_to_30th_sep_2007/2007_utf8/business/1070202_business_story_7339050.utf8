 New policy on airport ground handling 

 OUR BUREAU

 Chidambaram: Good news

 New Delhi, Feb. 1: The government today cleared a fresh ground handling policy that will allow three operators in the ground handling business at major airports.

 The decision by the cabinet committee on security will restrict the number of players at airports like Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad and place them under strict vetting by security agencies.

 There will be three ground handling agents at the airports. They will be the airport operator or its subsidiary, a subsidiary of Air India and the Indian and a ground handler selected through competitive bidding, finance minister P. Chidambaram said after the meeting. The airport operator in most of these airports is either AAI or a private company-led joint venture. Air-India and Indian have been working to form a joint venture company for ground handling and this is likely to be the second player in the category.

 All operators who operate at these airports and are unable to be one of the three permitted parties, will have to stop operations by 2009. 

 HMT package

 The government today cleared a Rs 723-crore cash package to revive the ailing HMT Machine Tools Ltd through a joint venture .

 The cash transfusion will clean up the companys balance sheet and fund its voluntary retirement scheme (VRS), Chidambaram said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA).

 NTPC project

 The CCEA also approved a Rs 5,352-crore power project to be set up jointly by NTPC and the Railways at Nabinagar in Bihar. The joint venture company called Bhartiya Rail Bijlee Company Ltd, with its headquarters in the national capital region, will have an authorised capital of Rs 1,605.75 crore.

 Urea pricing

 The government has approved the new pricing scheme for urea manufacturing units in the country, which introduces a system of incentives for additional urea production. The present provision of prior government permission for additional urea production has been dispensed with.

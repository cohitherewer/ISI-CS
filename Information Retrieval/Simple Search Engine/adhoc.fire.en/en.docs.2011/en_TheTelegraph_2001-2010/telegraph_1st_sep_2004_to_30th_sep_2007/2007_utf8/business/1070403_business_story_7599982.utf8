 Getz Primed for cut-throat rivalry

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, April 2: Hyundai Motor India Ltd today launched the Getz Prime, its all-new hatchback, to take on Marutis Swift. The 1.5-litre diesel variant will be introduced in the second half of this year.

 The base model of the Swift is priced at Rs 3.99 lakh, making the new Getz cheaper by Rs 10,000. The price war is set to intensify after Hyundai launches its second compact car, codenamed Project PA, in October. 

 The new compact car will be positioned to compete with the top-end models of the Zen Estillo and the WagonR, while the existing Santro will be priced more attractively to take on the lower end of competition and also wean away customers from the Alto.

 The new compact car will be rolled out from our second plant in Chennai, Lheem said. The company will also introduce a second diesel variant of its C segment car the Verna and LPG and CNG variants of its flagship Santro soon.

 While the Verna SX will make its debut in May or June, the LPG and CNG variants of the Santro will hit the market in the next couple of months, said H.S. Lheem, managing director of Hyundai Motor India.

 At present, Hyundai sells three petrol and one diesel variants of the Verna. The Getz Prime, which will be made in the plant near Chennai, comes in two engine options a powerful 1.3-litre and an economical 1.1-litre priced between Rs 3.89 lakh and Rs 5.24 lakh.

 The company has already started exporting the new Getz, primarily to Europe, from the last week of March. About 4,000 cars formed the first consignment to Germany.

 We will produce 40,000 units of the Getz Prime for Europe and 30,000 for the domestic market. We have a total sales target of 70,000 units for 2007-08, said Lheem.

 The Getz Prime is the third model from the Hyundai stable that is manufactured in India to be exported to Europe. The other two models are the Santro and the Accent.

 This year, the company will export about 135,000 cars of the Santro, Getz and Accent. Last year, it exported 113,000 units. Hyundai Motor India is setting up a second assembly plant in Chennai, which will have the capacity to produce 3 lakh units a year and raise the annual capacity to 6 lakh units by the end of this year.

 HMIL will expand capacity in line with its plan to make India an export hub for compact cars. On rising interest rates being a deterrent to its sales prospects, HMIL vice-president, sales and marketing, Arvind Saxena said it was premature to come to a conclusion.

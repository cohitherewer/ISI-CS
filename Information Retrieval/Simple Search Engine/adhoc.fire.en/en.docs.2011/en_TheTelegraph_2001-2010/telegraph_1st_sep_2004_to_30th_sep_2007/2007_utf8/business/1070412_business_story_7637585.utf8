 ONGC board clears Tripura gas project

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, April 11: The board of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has approved a clutch of investment proposals. These include the Rs 1,817-crore project to increase gas production in Tripura. The gas is for the proposed power plant in the state.

 The project will build upstream facilities to raise gas output by 3 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) from 1.45 mmscmd.

 ONGC will undertake fast-track exploration through intensive drilling and set up surface infrastructure to supply the gas to the 740-mw plant of ONGC Tripura Power Company. ONGC has a 50 per cent stake in the power company. Implementation of the integrated power generation and transmission project will require an investment of Rs 3,844 crore.

 The board has approved ONGCs equity investment in the power company. In the overall investment of Rs 3,844 crore with a debt-equity ratio of 70:30, ONGCs investment works out to be Rs 576 crore.

 The upstream and downstream activities will be stepped up and the power plant is scheduled for commissioning by 2010. 

 This integrated project will enable ONGC to harness its gas potential in the northeastern state through the gas-to-wire concept.

 The other proposals cleared by the board include construction of seven pipelines in Mumbai High (North) at an investment of Rs 355 crore.

 These pipelines will connect Mumbai High (North) to the upcoming MHN complex, which is expected to be completed by April 2010.

 The board has approved an incremental investment of Rs 795 crore for the C-Series development project, which is under implementation. 

 The investment will create facilities at NQ process complex at Mumbai High (North) to handle additional 3.0 mmscmd of gas from the C-Series wells. 

 The board has also approved a Rs 228-crore proposal to construct an energy-efficient and environment-friendly office building (in around 32,000 square metres) at Rajarhat in Calcutta. This office will help attain operational synergy by bringing all the ONGC offices in the city under one roof.

 The eastern region has been fast emerging as a potentially rich hydrocarbon destination of the country. The new complex aspires to secure a platinum rating from the United States Green Building Council.

 The board has also approved the donation of a fully-loaded mobile cancer detection unit to the Assam Government at an estimated cost of Rs 48 lakh.

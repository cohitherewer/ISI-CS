 Daimler weighs local base for Actros trucks

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 6: DaimlerChrysler India (DCI) is considering manufacturing its Actros range of trucks in the country.

 Currently, we are looking at options for the Actros, but have not taken any decision yet, said Wilfried Aulbur, managing director and CEO of DCI.

 At present, the truck, which costs approximately Rs 50 lakh, is imported from Germany in completely built units.

 Launched in the second half of 2006, the company has sold 65 units till now. 

 However, not ruling out the possibility of manufacturing the trucks in India, Aulbur said, At present, the volumes in this segment are not big enough. However, to serve the market at some point in time, we will have to be present in the commercial vehicles segment. 

 Globally, DaimlerChrysler has about 15 per cent market share in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle segment. The company expects the Actros range be useful in the booming mining sector. While mining is still a niche segment, selling about 800-900 units a year, it is growing at about 15-20 per cent a year.

 Meanwhile, the company said it would launch the new C Class showcased in the Geneva Motor Show last month in the beginning of next year.

 The company today displayed the latest edition of its S-Class diesel, the S 320CDI L and the coupe Mercedes Benz CL-Class. The S-Class diesel is priced at Rs 72.73 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi), while CL-Class 500 is available at a price tag of Rs 1.19 crore. 

 The CL-Class 600 is priced at Rs 1.65 crore.

 The company sold 95 vehicles of S Class, 352 of E Class and 226 of C Class and a couple of CBUs. DCI sold 2,121 vehicles in 2006 against 1,915 in 2005, representing a growth of 11 per cent.

 In top gear

 Unruffled by competition from BMW and Audi, DaimlerChrysler said it was confident of maintaining its leadership position in India and plans to expand its product portfolio.

 The premium car market in India is growing very fast and we are confident of maintaining our leadership position. Last year, we had 11 per cent growth and this year already we have posted strong growth in the first quarter, quot; Aulbur said.

 He said competition from BMW and Audi will help expand the market.

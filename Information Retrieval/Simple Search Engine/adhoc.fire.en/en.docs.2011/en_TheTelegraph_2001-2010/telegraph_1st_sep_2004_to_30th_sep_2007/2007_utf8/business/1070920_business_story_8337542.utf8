 Moodys forecasts slowdown

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: Economic growth is likely to fall below the 9 per cent plus rate in recent years, the economic analysis arm of international rating agency Moodys said.

 The report, titled India Outlook: The Elephants Charge Expected to Slow, said real GDP was expected to moderate in the second half of 2007 as tighter monetary conditions would dampen the demand for credit and take some steam out of consumer spending. 

 However, strong construction and infrastructure spending will partially offset the expected slowdown in consumer demand, the report added.

 The manufacturing sector will continue to grow at a solid pace with over one billion potential domestic customers.

 However, the pace of output growth will moderate into single digits as higher borrowing costs dampen consumer spending and credit growth.

 While the strong rupee will continue to temper the expansion of Indias export sector, it will also support import demand, putting even more pressure on the countrys gaping trade and current account deficits, the report said. 

 Moodys said as manufacturers were still primarily oriented around the domestic market, the sector had been partially insulated from the slowdown in global demand.

 New Delhi, Jan. 17: Yemen has invited ONGC to build a 100,000-barrels-per-day oil refinery, but the Indian company will go ahead with the project only if it gets an exploration block in the West Asian country.

 Khalid Mahfoud Bahah, oil minister of Yemen, today said, We have invited the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) to set up a refinery. ONGC has shown interest, but it will decide if it gets an exploration block in Yemen.

 Bahah said Yemen already has two refineries and has awarded a contract for a third to Reliance Industries and Yemens Hood Oil.

 Yemen is planning to build two more 100,000-barrels-per-day refineries, of which an invitation for one has been given to ONGC, he said.

 Meanwhile, ONGC-Videshs (OVL) plans to pick up a stake in the onshore San Cristobal oilfield in Venezuela are on track. The decision to give OVL a stake in the field was announced earlier by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.

 We have decided to award the San Cristobal block to OVL, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) vice-president Lois F. Vierma said on the sidelines of the Petrotech international conference. However, he refused to divulge the stake that OVL will get. 

 OVL was seeking a 49 per cent stake in the oilfield but will probably have to settle for 30 to 40 per cent. The oilfield has the potential to produce 100,000 barrels of oil a day.

 Venezuela is one of the top 10 crude oil producers. India has signed an umbrella agreement to establish a general framework for cooperation in the hydrocarbon sector.

 Meanwhile, Myanmars offshore A-1 block, where OVL and GAIL (India) Ltd together hold a 30 per cent stake, may hold recoverable reserves of 4 trillion cubic feet instead of the earlier estimate of 8.6 trillion cubic feet.

 The new figure has been arrived at by UK-based Gaffney Cline through an independent certification of the reserves in the block operated by Daewoo of South Korea, industry sources said.

 Oil prices

 India today urged Saudi Arabia, the largest oil exporter, to use its influence in Opec to stabilise global oil prices that will ensure sustainable growth for developing countries.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi that soaring oil prices had hit import-dependent countries like India and Opec should do much more to rein in volatility, a senior official said.

 The Indian oil import bill shot up by 45 per cent to $29.3 billion in April-October this year from $21.2 billion in the corresponding period last year, as international crude prices skyrocketed to over $70 a barrel. Petroleum minister Murli Deora said, Prices have come down this year but we want them to fall further.

 The Saudi oil minister, however, said, We do not want to see volatility in the market, but prices are determined by the market.

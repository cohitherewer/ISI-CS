 Essar Oil ready to tap global markets

 Dollar dream

 Calcutta, Aug. 31: Essar Oil plans to raise $750 million (about Rs 3,000 crore) from overseas markets to fund the expansion of its Vadinar refinery in Gujarat.

 In a notice to stock exchanges today, the company said it would raise the money through foreign currency convertible bonds, global or American depositary receipts or other instruments.

 A company spokesperson said the proceeds would mainly be used to expand the capacity of the refinery to 16 million tonnes from 10.5mt and for upgradation.

 Essar shareholders are meeting on September 29 to vote on the proposal.

 The expansion, which will require investments of $1.2 billion, will be completed by 2010.

 Essar is also planning a new 16mt refinery in a special economic zone in Gujarat.

 The Vadinar refinery runs at a capacity of 7.5mt and is expected to reach full capacity by October.

 Faced with restrictions in domestic markets, Essar exports 70 per cent of its oil products.

 Private refiners, such as Reliance and Essar, are unable to raise prices because the government often asks their public sector rivals to hold the line on prices.

 However, the government compensates the public sector companies through oil bonds, which is not the case with private refiners.

 Essar has about 1,200 petrol pumps in the country, of which only 1,000 are operational because of the restrictions.

 Reliance and Essar wanted to set up 5,000 retail outlets each but have put the plans on hold.

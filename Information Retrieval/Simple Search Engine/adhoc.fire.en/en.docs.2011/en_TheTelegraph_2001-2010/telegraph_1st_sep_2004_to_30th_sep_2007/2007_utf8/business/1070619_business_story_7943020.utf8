 New feather in Mumbai cap

 Mumbai, June 18 (PTI): Mumbai has beaten Hong Kong and Beijing to figure among the worlds top 10 financial flow hubs. High trading volumes for equities and good presence of global banking and financial services firms helped the city make the grade. 

 A survey conducted by Mastercard Worldwide has ranked the city tenth among the worlds biggest centres of commerce in terms of financial flow volumes. 

 The survey considered the size of financial services network and equity, bond, derivatives and commodity contract transactions.

 The list, having London at the first and New York at the second positions, included two other Asian cities Tokyo ranking fifth and Seoul sixth. It, however, did not have any representation from China another emerging Asian economy.

 The other cities were Chicago, Frankfurt, Paris, Madrid and Milan.

 The list is dominated by European cities.

 Mastercard Worldwide said the financial flow dimension was an integration of five indicators financial services network, equity transactions, bond transactions, derivatives contracts traded and commodities contracts traded all equally important.

 The financial services network includes the presence and intensity of global banking institutions, insurance firms and global securities companies.

 These top-ranking centres of commerce conform to the network of global financial transactions and flow; although more detailed analysis would show specialisation between the centres in areas such as bonds, derivatives and equity trading, Mastercard said.

 The Mastercard study also ranked the worlds top cities in terms of their performance as overall centres of commerce in the global economy. Mumbai ranked 45th in the list, while London, New York and Tokyo grabbed the top three slots.

 China had three cities in the top-50 list, with Hong Kong at the fifth position, Shanghai at 32nd and Beijing at 46th. However, Mumbai was the only Indian city on the list.

 The index considered six aspects legal and political framework, economic stability, ease of doing business, financial flow, business centre and knowledge creation and information flow.

 Mumbai, however, did not figure in the individual top-10 list on the five metrics other than financial flow.

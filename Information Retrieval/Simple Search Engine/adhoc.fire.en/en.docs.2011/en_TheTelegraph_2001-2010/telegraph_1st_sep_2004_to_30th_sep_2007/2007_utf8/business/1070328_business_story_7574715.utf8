 UK court approves Corus takeover

 London, March 27 (PTI): Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus group today said its $12-billion takeover by Tata Steel has been approved by the UK court paving the way for the completion of the deal early next week.

 The high court of justice in England and Wales today sanctioned the scheme of arrangement related to Corus acquisition by Tata Steel at a price of 608 pence a share, the London Stock Exchange-listed firm said in a regulatory filing.

 Corus expects the transaction to be effective on April 2.

 The court decision follows approval of the deal by Corus shareholders with an overwhelming majority of over 96 per cent on March 7.

 Corus said that trading in its shares on LSE and Amsterdam Stock Exchange and in American Depository Shares at New York Stock Exchange was expected to be suspended on March 29, while another court hearing was scheduled for March 30 to confirm the reduction in the companys equity capital.

 Tata Steel had said on February 7 that it plans to despatch the consideration amount as soon as possible on or after April 2. 

 The Indian firm is required to despatch the consideration not more than 14 days after the effective date of the transaction.

 Toyota to roll out small car in two years

 Cho: Small is big

 New Delhi, Aug. 22: Toyota Motors will launch a small car in India within the next two years.

 Toyota is developing a small car which may be introduced in India within two years. We are looking at several countries to market this product but it will be launched first in India, said Fujio Cho, chairman of the board of Toyota Motor Corporation.

 He was speaking on the sidelines of an Indo-Japan business conference attended by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

 Toyota plans to raise its annual capacity in India 10-fold to six lakh vehicles a year by 2015. The car maker hopes to garner 15 per cent of Indias passenger vehicle market by 2015. It had a 3.7 per cent share as on March 31 this year.

 Toyota Motors will set up its second manufacturing facility in India at its existing location in Bangalore. 

 We have plenty of space at the existing location in Bangalore and the new plant may come up there if we need additional capacity, said Cho. 

 The new plant will have a capacity of 1 lakh units a year. The existing facility has a capacity of 60,000 units.

 Toyotas low-cost car is being planned for emerging markets and, possibly, for more developed markets as well. India has topped the list of global candidates for a site to build the cheap family car, sources said. Another destination being considered is Brazil.

 Tata Motors is building a low-cost small car priced at about Rs 1 lakh, which is expected to be launched in the second half of 2008.

 French car manufacturer Renault, which in partnership with Mahindra amp; Mahindra makes the Logan in India, is also in talks with Bajaj Auto to make competitive vehicles in India. 

 Renaults success with the Logan has prompted other auto makers, including Fiat and Volkswagen, to examine low-cost models.

 Annual passenger vehicle sales in India are expected to nearly double to 2 million units by 2010. 

 More than two-thirds of the market here is for small cars.

 Coal royalty rate up

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 21: The cabinet committee on economic affairs today approved an average increase of 14 per cent in the coal royalty paid to state governments.

 The higher royalty rates will impact the price of coal, which is the main input in power generation. This means both industrial and domestic consumers will have to shell out more money for electricity.

 Coal-fired electricity generating units account for 70 per cent of the power produced in the country. After the CCEA meeting, finance minister P. Chidambaram said the revision in cost would reflect in the prices at the consumer level.

 However, a coal ministry official said the impact of the royalty revision on prices would be minimal. The rates were raised because of persistent demands from coal-rich states such as Jharkhand and Orissa.

 The producing states were demanding an increase in the rates as royalty on coal had not been revised since 2002,Chidambaram said.

 He added that the increase in revenues for the states, barring Bengal, would be 24 per cent for coal and 27 per cent for lignite. The revenues of the coal-producing states will increase to Rs 3,718 crore from Rs 3,000 crore, he said.

 Bengal will continue to have the older rates as the state government levies a cess on coal, which the Centre considers illegal. Chidambaram said states contended that though coal companies were frequently revising prices upwards, the benefit was not shared with the producing states as royalty was a fixed amount paid per tonne of coal sold.

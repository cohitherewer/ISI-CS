 Citi bullish on auto parts firms 

 New Delhi, July 15 (PTI): The auto parts industry, especially forging, will continue to witness a robust growth in exports as original equipment makers increasingly outsource parts from India, a latest Citigroup report said.

 The Association of Auto Components Manufacturers Association said exports would grow at the rate of 25 per cent during 2006-10. Analysing the associations estimate, the report said, Exports will continue to accelerate as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and tier I suppliers increasingly outsource parts from India. 

 During 2003-06, production and exports have grown at a steady compounded annual growth rate of 21 per cent.

 We have a positive view of the industry, given Indias well-documented strengths labour cost arbitrage, skilled technical manpower, a burgeoning domestic OEM base, healthy IPR practices and access to global technology through tieups, said citigroup analyst Jamshed Dadabhoy.

 However, the overall growth of the auto component sector is not devoid of risk elements as factors such as an appreciating rupee has weakened margins and eroded competitiveness against other countries. According to the Association of Indian Forging Industrys estimates, Indias current capacity in forging products is 9.29 lakh tonnes per annum.

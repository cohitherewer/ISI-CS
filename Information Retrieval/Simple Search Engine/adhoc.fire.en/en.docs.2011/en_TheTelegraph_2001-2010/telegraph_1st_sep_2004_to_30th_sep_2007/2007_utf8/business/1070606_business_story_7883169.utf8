 SAIL gears up for rail link project

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Chugging forward 

Calcutta, June 5: The Steel Authority of India Limited is setting up a rail link from the Dalli-Rajhara iron ore complex to the Rowghat mines in Chhattisgarh.

 SAIL will spend Rs 450 crore to lay the 95 kilometre link to Rowghat. Last week, the company paid Rs 25 crore to the South Eastern Central Railways for the broad gauge rail project. It had also coughed up Rs 5 crore early this year. Bhilai Steel managing director R. Ramaraju had handed over the cheque to Pradeep Kumar, general manager, South Eastern Central Railways.

 The Rs 750-crore rail link project will prove to be a lifeline for the Bhilai Steel Plant since its iron ore reserves at the Dalli-Rajhara complex is depleting. The link will connect the steel plant to the Bastar region. 

 SAIL, the Chhattisgarh government and the Indian Railways have joined hands to complete the rail link in time.

 According to the agreement, SAIL will bear the entire cost of the construction of the rail line between Dalli-Rajhara to Rowghat and a partial cost of the RowghatJagdalpur section. 

 Bhilai Steel is yet to receive an approval from the Union ministry of environment amp; forests for the mining lease in Rowghat.

 Policy pills bring down prices

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 13: The rate of inflation fell to a three-month low as cut in import duties reduced prices of cement, edible oil and other manufactured goods. For the week ended March 31, the inflation rate was at 5.74 per cent compared with 6.39 per cent for the week ended March 24.

 The government, along with the RBI, has gone into an an overdrive to check prices, especially after the poll reverses of the Congress in Punjab and Uttarakhand, which were blamed on inflation.

 Even today, the government slashed customs duty on the palm oil group by 10 per cent to keep prices of these edible oils in control.

 The duty reduction on the palm oil group brings the effective rate on crude palm oil, crude palmolein and other fractions of crude palm oil to 50 per cent just 5 per cent short of a duty level desired by major exporting nation Malaysia.

 The government also took heart from the revised figures of inflation for the week ended February 3. Inflation for that week has now been pegged at 6.58 per cent compared with the earlier estimate of 6.73 per cent. Provisional inflation rates are revised after two months on availability of additional price inputs. 

 Finance ministry officials said the lower inflation was due to the increase in key policy rates of the RBI and the cut in import duties. However, they admitted that the base effect also played a part. Partially the fall is because of the base effect ... lets say half a per cent has got knocked off because of the inflation busting measures and a quarter per cent because of the base effect.

 The lower inflation rate may dissuade the central bank from raising again its overnight lending rates. The RBI has done so six times in 15 months to check money supply and inflation.

 Calcutta, April 17: The government will put up about 60 oil and gas blocks for sale within a month under the seventh round of the new exploration licensing policy (Nelp).

 V.K. Sibal, director-general of hydrocarbons, said the government planned to offer 400,000 sq km for exploration by India and domestic companies. Directorate general of hydrocarbons (DGH) is the nodal agency for the bidding of the blocks.

 The seventh round has the highest number of blocks on offer. The sixth round was for 55 blocks. So far, the government has signed 200 production sharing contracts (PSC) through Nelp bidding and nomination.

 The government has recently concluded the sixth round of Nelp and the third round of coal bed methane block bidding. 

 A total of 26 companies submitted bids and eight foreign companies participated for the first time. Around 165 bids were received for 52 blocks of the 55 blocks on offer. 

 A number of the blocks in the seventh round may pose a challenge to the exploration of oil and gas.

 But Sibal said there was a huge untapped potential. Nelp has immensely helped the government to find oil and gas in the country, he said on the sidelines of Eastern India Energy Summit here today. 

 The seminar was organised by India Energy Forum and the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

 Sibal said three regions with potential large reserves were in the deep waters along the Indian coastline, Assam and offshore Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

 Mahanadi basin find

 Sibal said an oil company has claimed a big discovery on the Mahanadi basin. 

 I cannot name the company which found it. It is a listed company and the information is sensitive, he said.

 Reliance and ONGC are working in the region. Reliance and its Canadian partner Niko have struck gas in the NEC-25 block in the region. Sources said an announcement could be made within a week. 

 Reliance is developing an oilfield of 10,000-sq-km area in the NEC 25 block. The present estimate of hydrocarbon is 2-8 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of gas, but this may go up to 20 TCF when fully explored.

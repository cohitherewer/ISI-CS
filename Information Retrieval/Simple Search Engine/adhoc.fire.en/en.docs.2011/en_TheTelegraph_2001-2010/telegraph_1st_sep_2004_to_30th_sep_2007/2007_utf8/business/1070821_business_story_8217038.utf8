 New Delhi, Aug. 20: Maruti Udyog is betting big on the rural market to drive sales of its cheaper vehicles such as the Maruti 800, Omni and the Alto. 

 The company, which launched the rural scheme early this fiscal, has already started getting results. It reported sales of 6,800 units and around 25,000 enquiries. 

 Easy financing and discounts provided by the company helped push up sales. It offered a discount of Rs 5,000 on a Maruti 800, Rs 4,000 on an Omni and Rs 3,000 on an Alto. Of the total units sold under the scheme, the Alto accounted for around 50 per cent, followed by the Maruti 800 at 23 per cent.

 Maruti has set a target of selling one vehicle in every two primary health centres and one car in every 20 villages. There are 6.45 lakh villages. One car sold in every 20 villages translates into 32,000 cars sold, said a Maruti official. 

 One of the reasons for the company to do well in rural areas is its ability to tie up with regional rural banks and financiers such as Mahindra Finance, Magma Leasing, Cholamandalam DBS and Axis Bank.

 It has also started involving panchayats by taking part in rural events and sports to increase its visibility. 

 The car maker has appointed around 1,500 sales executives in semi-urban and rural areas to build and maintain relationships with potential customers. These people do not necessarily have formal qualification or English speaking skills but are in a position to communicate better with the target consumer, marketers said. 

 Analysts say signs of economic development are visible in rural India with the number of households owning cars, motorcycles and television sets increasing significantly.

 Batliboi to buy Canada firm for Rs 22 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 27: Batliboi Ltd will acquire Canada-based Quickmill Inc for a consideration of Rs 22 crore. This is the first instance of a domestic company buying an overseas machine tool firm. 

 Batliboi will fund the acquisition through a mix of internal accruals and debt. The debt, which will be largely through foreign currency loans, is likely to come at an interest rate of 6.5-7 per cent. 

 Ontario-based Quickmill Inc manufactures large area machining centres in heat exchangers, machinery equipment, aerospace, dice amp; moulds, bridge building machinery and automotive sectors. It has annual sales of around Rs 52 crore and it has a 75 per cent market share in the heat exchanger industry in North America. 

 Nirmal Bhogilal, chairman and managing director of Batliboi Ltd, said, The acquisition of Quickmill Inc supports our goal of becoming an internationally competitive niche player in our various businesses. Our strategy is to support Quickmills current management to grow and develop Quickmill as a separate and distinct entity leveraging their technology, strong brand, reputation and expertise. 

 Batliboi plans to reap synergies from the acquisition through its distribution network. It is also expected that there will be some cost advantages coming through component sourcing and detailed engineering.

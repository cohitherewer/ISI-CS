 Wanderlust ignores pain of rising air fare

 GARIMA SINGH

New Delhi, March 28: International air fares may be on a high but the travel and trade industry is optimistic about a 30-35 per cent growth in outbound travel from India this year.

 The trend is already visible with airlines flying choc-a-bloc on international routes. Tour operators say it is a combination of both leisure and business travel that is propelling growth in this sector.

 Tour operators said outbound travel has already started picking up for the season. Nearly 80 per cent of travel takes place during peak summer.

 Bulk of travel takes place between April and June. Group travel is not only pre-negotiated but also booked months in advance, said Colonel Chaddha from Tui Select Vacations.

 A growing middle-class economy with high disposable income, open sky policies, increasing number of Indian carriers flying to international destinations and attractive packages by low-cost airlines are likely to motivate more Indians to travel overseas.

 Around 7.2 million Indians travelled abroad in 2006. The peak season for outbound travel is April-September. 

 Increase in air fares will not pull back Indians from travelling abroad. In fact, travelling abroad can sometimes be cheaper than flying within the country. We are confident to see a 35-40 per cent growth in this segment, said Pankaj Acharya, manager-leisure travel, Thomas Cook India. 

 Europe and the UK are the most favoured destinations for travel, while the Far East and the US also rule the charts for Indians travelling abroad for both leisure and business purposes.

 A three to four-day package to the Far East is available for Rs 35,000-40,000 per person, while a trip to Europe covering seven to eight countries is also an all-time favourite.

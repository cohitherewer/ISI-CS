 Corus deal by April

 OUR BUREAU

Calcutta/Mumbai, Feb. 8: The Tatas are expecting to wrap up the Corus deal by April. In a letter to the London Stock Exchange yesterday, the Indian company said it expected to set the effective date for the scheme of arrangement under which it takes over the company to be end-March or early April.

 The effective date will follow the court-appointed extraordinary general meeting on March 7 when shareholders get to vote on the Tata offer.

 Tata Steel will have 14 days time from the effective date to make the payment to the shareholders and ADS holders. However, the company said it intended to despatch consideration following the scheme as soon as practicable following the effective date and if practicable, on the effective date itself.

 The detailed timetable will be known when Tata Steel UK, the special purpose vehicle created by Tata Steel to facilitate Corus acquisition, posts the revised scheme document to the shareholders.

 The scheme document is expected to be posted next week. Shareholders will have to be given minimum three weeks time before the court meeting and EGM.

 Tata Steel outbid Brazils CSN on January 31 with a 608 pence a share offer and the Corus board also recommended it to the shareholders the same day.

 Meanwhile, Tata Sons the holding company of the group sold another 81.74 lakh shares in Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) during a two-week period between January 24 and February 6, ostensibly to raise cash to fund the buyout. 

 The sale constituted 0.84 per cent of TCS equity. After the sale, the Tata holding in TCS has dipped to 77.51 per cent from 78.35 per cent. Sources said Tata Sons would have garnered at least Rs 1,000 crore from the sale.

 Reliance scrip scales new peak

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 11: The Reliance Industries stock today broke through a critical barrier of Rs 2,000 in intra-day trades and emphatically underscored the bounty that the shareholders have earned since Dhirubhai Ambanis empire was carved up between his two sons in January 2006.

 On the BSE, the RIL share opened at a historic high of Rs 2007, bolstered by news of its acquisition of Hualon, an integrated polyester-to-textile manufacturing company in Malaysia. 

 However, it could not sustain this level amid a broad market weakness and it ended the day at Rs 1,986.30, a loss of 0.05 per cent over its previous close.

 RIL now has the largest weight of 13.47 per cent in the BSE sensex. Its closing price marked a full market capitalisation of Rs 276,792.50 crore and a free-float market cap of Rs 138,396.25 crore.

 The RIL share may not have ended above the Rs 2,000 mark, but analysts said there were clear indications of the things to come. 

 Observers feel that the stock will catch fire after gas starts flowing from the Krishna-Godavari basin by the middle of next year and its subsidiary, Reliance Petroleum Ltd, starts operations towards the end of 2008.

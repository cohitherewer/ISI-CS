 E amp;Y sees new issue deluge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 20: Ernst amp; Young today forecast that the initial public offering (IPO) market in India will get stronger this year. The global research and consultancy firm expects more than 100 companies to hit the market this year.

 Indias IPO market, the eighth largest in the world, saw $7.23 billion being raised through 78 issues last year.

 The fourth annual global IPO report by Ernst amp; Young said 2006 saw brisk activity worldwide with the greatest amount of capital raised at $246 billion through 1,729 deals.

 Greater Chinas IPO markets soared to an all-time high, with several large issues in 2006 and more in 2007. The market in India benefited from a strong economy, buoyant stock market and robust corporate earnings.

 The US had the biggest number of offerings at 187 followed by Japan at 185 and China at 175.

 Ernst amp; Young said in 2006, Indias IPO market was fairly broad-based, though energy companies dominated with a share of more than 50 per cent. The largest IPO last year was from Reliance Petroleum, which raised $1.8 billion, followed by Cairn Energy, which raised $1.3 billion. 

 Real estate offerings also generated excellent returns, it added. 

 As some analysts say, corporate India is not only in an expansionary mode but also in an acquisitive one. This has raised their capital market needs. Thus, larger deal sizes in India are consistent with the growth in the economy and the need for capital, the consultancy firm said.

 According to Ernst amp; Young, while foreign institutional investors make up three-fourths of new funds flowing into the market, foreign capital is supporting much of Indias growth.

 In recent years, international asset managers (Fidelity and Templeton) have set up shop in India and posted strong growth. Though most Indian companies list only in the country, a growing number of them went abroad, primarily for higher valuations and visibility.

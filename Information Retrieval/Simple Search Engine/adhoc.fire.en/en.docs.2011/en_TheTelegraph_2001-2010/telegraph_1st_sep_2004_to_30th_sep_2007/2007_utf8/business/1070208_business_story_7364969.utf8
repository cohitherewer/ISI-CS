 Roche profit jumps 34%

 Pep pill

 Basel, Switzerland, Feb. 7 (Reuters): Profits at Roche Holding AG leapt 34 per cent in 2006 on strong sales of cancer treatments Herceptin and Avastin and flu drug Tamiflu but worries over future margins hit the stock on Wednesday. 

 Results from the Swiss healthcare group were broadly in line with analyst expectations, with net income of 9.17 billion Swiss francs ($7.33 billion) close to the average forecast of 9.11 billion francs in a Reuters poll of 15 analysts. 

 The figures, however, disappointed those hoping for more from the darling of the European pharmaceuticals sector and cautious comments on prospects for margin expansion in 2007 knocked the stock back from recent record highs. 

 Roche certificates fell 2.7 per cent to 232 francs by 1000 GMT, after scaling an all-time high of 241.40 on Tuesday. 

 For the coming year, Roche expects above market sales growth in both its pharmaceuticals and diagnostics divisions with the group as a whole and pharma showing double-digit percentage growth rates in local currencies although pandemic sales of Tamiflu are expected to ease compared to 2006. 

 Core earnings per share, meanwhile, are forecast to grow in line with sales. 

 In spite of higher-than-expected sales, the profit split within the pharmaceuticals is worse than expected and the profit contribution from diagnostics is lower than forecast, said bank Vontobel analyst Karl-Heinz Koch. 

 This, together with the EPS growth outlook provided by management, raises some question marks regarding earnings estimates.

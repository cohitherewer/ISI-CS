The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Ceat recast approved

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 23: Ceat Ltd will hive off its investment business into a separate company.

 The board of the RPG Enterprises group firm, which met today in Mumbai to declare the fourth-quarter and full-year results, approved the demerger. According to the plan, a shareholder will get 75 shares of Ceat and 25 of the investment company for every 100 held.

 There will be no change in the shareholding pattern following the restructuring. The shareholding pattern of the new entity will mirror that of Ceat. K.J. Rao, chief financial officer of Ceat, said investments, whose book value is worth Rs 126 crore, would be transferred to the new company. The market value of these assets would be around Rs 400 crore, he added.

 Ceat has investments in many listed and some unlisted companies. The restructuring has been aimed at unlocking value for the shareholders. From now on, Ceat will be able to focus on the tyre business, Rao said.

 The company is finalising a technology partner for its car radial business. It plans to set up a new plant for this. 

 Profit surge

 Ceat has posted a net profit of Rs 39.25 crore in 2006-07, up by about 75 times from Rs 0.52 crore in the previous year. Net sales improved from Rs 1,747 crore to Rs 2,134 crore. The board has recommended a dividend of Rs 1.80 per share.

 In the quarter ended March 31, Ceats net profit stood at Rs 23.41 crore, up by 375 per cent from Rs. 4.93 crore in the year-ago period.

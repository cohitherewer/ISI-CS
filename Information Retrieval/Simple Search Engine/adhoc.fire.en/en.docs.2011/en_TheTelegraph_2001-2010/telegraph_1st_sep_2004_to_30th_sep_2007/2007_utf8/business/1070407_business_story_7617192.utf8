 Hefty pay package for Ford CEO

 Detroit, April 6 (Reuters): Ford Motor Co said it awarded new chief executive Alan Mulally a $39.1-million compensation for four months of work in 2006, a year when the second-largest US automaker posted a $12.7-billion loss.

 Mulally, a former Boeing Co executive, replaced Ford family scion Bill Ford Jr as chief executive last September.

 According to Fords proxy filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Mulallys compensation included a prorated $666,667 salary, an $18.5-million bonus, $19.6 million of stock and option awards, and $334,433 of other compensation.

 The latter sum included $172,974 for the required use of corporate aircraft and $55,469 for relocation costs and temporary housing.

 Mulallys bonus included $7.5 million awarded when he was hired, and $11 million to offset compensation he gave up when he left Boeing, where he led the commercial plane division.

 Compensation is based on salary, bonus, the value of stock options and other awards granted during the year, as well as incentives and perks.

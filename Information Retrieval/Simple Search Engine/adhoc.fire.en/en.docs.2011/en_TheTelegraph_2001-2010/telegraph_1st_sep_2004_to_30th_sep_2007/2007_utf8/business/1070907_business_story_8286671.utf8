 Anil firm ups Saregama stake

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Sept. 6: Anil Ambani has raised his holding in Saregama India to 11.48 per cent by acquiring 4.28 per cent in the company through open market deals on Tuesday.

 The shares were bought by Sonata Investments Ltd, a Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group company, Saregama informed the National Stock Exchange.

 Saregama promoters, the Goenkas, held a little over 50 per cent in the company, as of June 30, 2007.

 There has been a persistent buzz in the market over Anils interest in acquiring Saregama, the entertainment venture of the RPG group. Saregama has the largest music catalogue in the country.

 However, the Goenkas have denied any move to sell their stake. 

 With a 50.77 per cent holding, the Goenkas are in a comfortable situation and can fend off any hostile takeover bid.

 Sonata held just above 5.04 per cent in Saregama as of June 30. In about two months, Anil has raised his stake by about 6 per cent.

 If Anil wants to buy the city-based company, he has to do so through a negotiated deal, market observers said.

 The Saregama stock has been active over the past week, gaining 23 per cent during this period.

 Reliance ADAG has interests across the entire range of the entertainment spectrum, from movies and gaming to Internet protocol television and FM radio. 

 It acquired Adlabs Films in 2005, one of the largest entertainment companies in India having interests in film processing, production, exhibition and digital cinema.

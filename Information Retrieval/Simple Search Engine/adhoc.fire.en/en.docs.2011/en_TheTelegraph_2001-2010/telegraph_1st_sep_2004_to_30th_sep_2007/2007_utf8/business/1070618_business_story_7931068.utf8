 DVC looks at tourism for income boost

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 17: Damodar Valley Corporation is looking at tourism and fisheries as alternative income sources.

 The company had entered into a joint venture with the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL amp;FS) last month to develop its reservoir sites Maithon, Tilaiya, Panchet and Konar into tourism spots.

 Under the arrangement, DVC and IL amp;FS will have equal shareholding in the venture, which will be called DVC Tourism Development Corporation.

 We are in the process of registering the new company. It will have an initial equity capital of Rs 5 crore, said Subrata Biswas, secretary of DVC.

 The company will possibly have its first board meeting by the first week of July, he added.

 The board will consider forming an expert committee to examine ways in which tourism can be developed at these sites and the kind of infrastructure and facilities that can be put in place.

 A tourism consultant firm may be hired to prepare the plan. Once the plan is ready, expressions of interest will be invited to develop the projects, Biswas said.

 Maithon will be the first site to be developed into a tourism spot and the project will be completed this fiscal. Panchet, Tilaiya and Konar reservoir sites will be developed after that. 

 DVC will also build a dam at Balpahari in Giridih, about 60 km away from Maithon. The Central Water Commission (CWC) is preparing the detailed project report.

 The CWC is expected to submit this report by August-September. We will then know the cost of the project. However, it will have a 20mw hydel power plant, Burman said. 

 The Balpahari dam will increase the life of the Maithon dam by another 35 years by restricting the slit flow, he added.

 DVC is also planning fish farming at its reservoirs.

 The Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute at Barrackpore is preparing a scheme. However, we are already stocking fingerlings at our Konar and Tilaiya dams in collaboration with the fisheries department of the Jharkhand government, said a senior official of DVC.

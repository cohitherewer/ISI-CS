 Potion for closed tea gardens

 AVIJIT SINHA

 Jalpaiguri, June 29: Jairam Ramesh, Union minister of state for commerce and industry, wants new owners to take over the closed tea gardens of the Dooars.

 It seems we will have to invoke section 16(D) of the Tea Act, 1953 to acquire the gardens, Ramesh said. Under the act, the Tea Board of India can take over gardens and hand them over to a new management. This comes after the closed gardens of Bharnobari and Red Bank in the Dooars failed to reopen as scheduled. 

 We will soon sit with the state government and devise a joint mechanism to consider the proposals from prospective owners, Ramesh said.

 The minister also said a professionally managed cooperative would be formed in Chamurchi, similar to the one at Durgabari in Tripura, to run the gardens.

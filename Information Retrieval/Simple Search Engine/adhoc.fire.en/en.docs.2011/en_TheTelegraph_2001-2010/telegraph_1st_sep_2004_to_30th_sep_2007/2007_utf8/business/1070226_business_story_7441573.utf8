Calcutta, Feb. 25: Taxpayers prefer unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips) to equity-linked savings schemes of mutual funds (ELSS) for tax saving investments.

 An analysis of the fund collection data between April and December, 2006, under these two instruments show that investors are shunning ELSS and lapping up Ulips more than ever.

 According to the monthly sales and repurchase data of the Association of Mutual Funds of India (Amfi), 40 mutual funds grossed Rs 2,370 by selling ELSS units between April and December 2006.

 The first-year premium collection (from new policies sold) from unit-linked plans by 16 life insurance companies was Rs 24,534.79 crore during the period, according to the latest data published by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda).

 Therefore, the premium collection from new unit-linked policies by life insurance companies was more than 10 times the fund mobilised by mutual funds through ELSS units.

 Interestingly, only three equity-linked savings schemes were launched between April and December and these could mop up only Rs 312 crore. Lotus India Mutual Fund, DSP Merrill Lynch Mutual Fund and HSBC Mutual Fund launched their open-ended tax saving schemes between November and December. While Lotus India MF could mop up only Rs 47 crore, investors parked Rs 267 crore in the ELSS of the other two fund houses. 

 Till March last year, ELSS contributed to only 2 per cent of mutual funds total assets under management.

 The first-year premium income from unit-linked plans by life insurance companies contributed 50.23 per cent of their new businesses during the first three quarters of this financial year. 

 In March 2006, units worth Rs 1,008 crore were sold under the existing open-ended ELSS. This increased the categorys share to 3 per cent. In the subsequent months, most of the sales were recorded in open-ended ELSS.

 Each mutual fund house can have only one open-ended equity-linked savings scheme in its product portfolio and any other such product must be a 10-year closed-end scheme. Most of the fund houses have one ELSS in their portfolio. This means that any additional equity-linked scheme they plan to offer must be a 10-year closed-end scheme. 

 Investors dont want to lock in their funds for such a long time. That is why we see a significant slowdown in the new fund offering in ELSS. Those who wanted to save tax by investing in ELSS chose the open-ended plans, said a fund manager from a leading private sector fund house. 

 In its budget proposal for 2005-06, the government made ELSS a 10-year closed-end scheme as they were in the 1990s. A government notification in November and clarification notes in December made ELSS investment less attractive. The November 3, 2005 notification said the lock-in should be counted from April 1 following the date of allotment or purchase of units of an ELSS.

 However, a clarification note on December 20, 2005, changed the definition of year for determining the lock-in period. 

 A year will now refer to a year commencing from the date of allotment of units (against the earlier definition meaning a year commencing from April 1), it said.

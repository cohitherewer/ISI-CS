 Hotels jack up room rates

 Pocket pinch

 New Delhi, June 7: Comfort comes at a high cost these days and a couple of nights at your favourite resort can burn a big hole in the pocket. And for this you can thank the business and leisure travel boom in the country. 

 The average room rate in most star hotels across the country has jumped by 25-30 per cent. Five-star hotels have seen the sharpest increase in room rates this year and the number is rising. 

 There is no likelihood of a slowdown. All metro destinations are doing very well and we are expecting a further boom, said Rajesh Mishra, president of the Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association of India.

 Most blame the demand-supply mismatch as the main reason behind the high prices. According to industry estimates, business and leisure travellers to India increased 14.6 per cent in the first two months of this fiscal against last year. Last year, 4.4 million tourists came to India compared with 3.8 million in 2005.

 Hotel owners said the rates were high in the last winter season, and the uptrend was maintained in the summer. The summer months are the busy season only in the hill resorts. 

 The rates cannot come down abruptly, said Deepak Haksar, general manager of ITC Maurya Sheraton, New Delhi.

 Room rates of the ITC group of hotels have increased 20-25 per cent. The rooms are priced between Rs 10,500 and Rs 12,000 per night in the metros with 90 per cent occupancy, said Haksar. This is against an average of Rs 8,500-10,000 last year.

 Tourists are visiting India in the off-season as well. Traditionally, October to March is the peak season and April to September is the lean season.

 India is a hotspot economic destination and people continue to travel for business purposes. Certainly, more foreign travellers are coming in this summer compared with last year, said Peter Leitgeb, president of Leela Palaces and Resorts. Room rates of Leela Kempinski in Mumbai have escalated by 32 per cent. The rooms are priced at Rs 10,500 against Rs 7,800 last year. 

 Prices at the five star hotel chains property in Goa has shot up by 35 per cent from Rs 6,700 last year to Rs 9,000 this year. But Leelas highest increase has been at its property in Kovalam, which has witnessed an increase of almost 50 per cent. The rooms are priced at Rs 6,000 per night against Rs 4,500 last year.

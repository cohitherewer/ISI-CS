 Oil, steel are winners

 Railway Budget 

 Mumbai, Feb. 26: Oil and steel companies will be the biggest beneficiaries of Lalu Prasads largesse.

 The railway minister today announced a six per cent cut in the freight rates of minerals, including iron ore and limestone, which are the key inputs for the steel and cement industries. 

 IOC director S.V. Narasimhan said, Our annual freight bill on petrol and diesel is Rs 750 crore and the freight rate cut will result in an annual saving of Rs 35 crore to Rs 40 crore.

 Last year, the railway budget had reduced the classification for diesel and petrol from class 240 to 220, effectively reducing tariff by about 9 per cent. 

 Rationalising it further, the budget announced today proposed to reduce the highest class from 220 to 210.

 It is estimated that the cut on petrol and diesel will also be beneficial for companies, including Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum.

 The cut really has been brought on demand of mineral based industries like steel and cement, Lalu Prasad said.

 SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta said the freight reduction of 6 per cent on iron ore, limestone and dolomite was likely to have a positive impact of around Rs 70 crore annually on the company. 

 Steel companies are shortly expected to pass on the benefit of the freight reduction to their consumers.

 On the other hand, sources at Essar Steel, which is one of the major private sector steel producers estimated that iron ore costs could come down by Rs 40 per tonne. 

 J. Mehra, director of Essar Steel, said the railway ministers shift to expanding new rail capacities was a welcome development after his earlier focus on utilising existing assets during the past two to three budgets.

 Calcutta, May 2: The US insurance company AIG has drawn up plans to become a leading player in the NBFC sector. 

 It has set up AIG Capital Company, which will offer credit card services, personal loans and home loans. AIG Capital will also offer loans to buy consumer durables and automobiles.

 We have set up a non-banking finance company, called AIG Capital Company Ltd, where we will invest $50 million over a period of two years, said Sunil Mehta, country head and chief executive of AIG. 

 AIG Capital has recently acquired Chennai-based consumer durables finance company Vivek Hire Purchase Ltd. It has also bought a Bangalore-based housing finance company, Mehta said.

 The acquisitions will enable AIG to offer five more services in India. Globally, our consumer finance arm is engaged in consumer durables loans, personal loans, credit cards, housing loans and aircraft leasing. We plan to offer all these products here, Mehta said.

 AIG, however, has no immediate plans for the auto loan business. The auto financing business is heavily crowded and we will get into it at an appropriate time, Mehta said.

 Meanwhile, many foreign companies such as HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank have decided to quit the car loan business in India. Citi Financial Services may also stop financing two-wheelers and consumer durables because of high rates of default. 

 AIG is also keen on the real estate market. We have floated a special purpose vehicle in a 50:50 joint venture with RMZ Ltd to develop a 2.6-million-sq-ft commercial complex at Rajarhat and a 13-acre plot in Chennai, Mehta said.

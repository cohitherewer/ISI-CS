 Panel seeks freeze on fresh SEZs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 In limbo

 New Delhi, Aug. 20: A parliamentary committee wants the government to freeze SEZ clearances and place a ceiling of 2,000 hectares on multi-product zones coming up on cultivable land.

 Within the SEZ, cultivable land should form less than 40 per cent of the area, the panel said. If cultivable land is indiscriminately given to SEZs, the country will plunge into a famine-like situation.

 New SEZs should not be notified till the rules have been amended to meet public concerns, the committee said in its report, which was placed in the upper house of Parliament today.

 Undue haste in approving SEZs and their proliferation has contributed to the resistance against the policy, the report said. 

 We need to understand the cause of farmers agitation and grievance.

 SEZs were meant to be engines of growth both for industry and exports. However, it has met with a lot of opposition during the last one year. The government must take a fresh look at the policy as a whole and re-frame it to make it people-friendly.

 On July 6, Murli Manohar Joshi, who heads the committee, had presented the report to the then Rajya Sabha chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. 

 There should preferably be a ban on the use of irrigated double crop land for setting up SEZs and normally waste and barren land should be used, he had said.

 So far, the board of approval in the ministry of commerce has formally approved 364 SEZ proposals and given in-principle clearances to 180.

 The committee has also protested against local administration for not allowing members of Parliament to meet farmers who have been affected by land acquisition for SEZs.

 A sub-committee visited Haryana, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Jamnagar and Mumbai to meet farmers. At some places farmers were not allowed to meet the ministers.

 The committee has suggested that land should be taken from farmers on lease so that they get periodic rentals along with a lump-sum payment. 

 The state governments should set a benchmark price for land and farmers should be paid above that rate, the committee added. 

 The National Relief and Rehabilitation Act and Land Acquisition Act of 1894 should also be replaced, the report said. 

 If the land is on lease, it would revert to the owner in case the SEZ fails or is dissolved for any reason. At least one member of the landowners family should be given employment in the SEZ venture, it said. 

 To prevent misuse of land for real estate, at least 50 per cent area should be used for manufacturing, the report said. 

 Noting that there was a rush among IT firms to set up SEZs, the committee recommended that these companies should be extended the tax holiday for 10 more years beyond 2009.

 Profit headache for oil titans

 In deep waters

 New York, Jan. 6 (Reuters): Energy stocks have taken a beating as crude oil prices plummeted this week, but oil producers will really feel the pain on the bottom line, threatening to wipe out billions of dollars in profits. 

 If this weeks $5.50 oil price drop is sustained over the year, Exxon Mobil would lose nearly $3 billion in profit about $540 million for every dollar off the price of oil per barrel, analysts said. 

 Chevron and ConocoPhillips, the second- and third-largest US oil companies, would lose about $330 million and $200 million, respectively, for every dollar off the price of oil per barrel per year. 

 I dont think many companies, if any, can offset a 10 per cent decline in the average crude price, said Howard Weil analyst Gene Gillespie, who believes oil company earnings could fall by up to 10 per cent this year from 2006. 

 Its going to be difficult sequentially to keep earnings at the level that they have been, he said. 

 Oil prices have dropped to around $55.50 a barrel from about $61 on Tuesday on warm winter weather in the US Northeast, high inventory levels and concerns about an economic slowdown. 

 Oil stocks have also dropped in the same period. The Chicago Board Options Exchanges oil index has lost about 5 per cent of its value since last week. 

 But the stocks are coming off all time-highs reached as the companies posted windfall profits on oil prices that hovered near all-time highs for much of last year. 

 Exxon, the worlds largest publicly traded company, is projected to have earned nearly $40 billion in profit in 2006. 

 Weve been in a period that has represented a confluence of extremely high commodity prices and extremely high margins, said Benchmark Company analyst Mark Gilman, who believes oil will average about $50 a barrel in 2007 and will eventually retreat to the $35-40 range. 

 He said that barring an unanticipated and material supply disruption, oil company profits have probably peaked. 

 Exxon Mobil spokesman Mark Boudreaux declined to comment on the effect current oil prices would have on the companys earnings.

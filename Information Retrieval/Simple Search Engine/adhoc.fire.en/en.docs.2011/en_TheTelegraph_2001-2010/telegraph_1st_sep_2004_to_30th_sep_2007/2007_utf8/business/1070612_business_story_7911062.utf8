 Microsoft, GE drop bid for Dow 

 New York, June 11 (AFP): Microsoft and NBC Universal, a subsidiary of General Electric, discussed but abandoned a possible bid for US media group Dow Jones, the target of an offer from Rupert Murdoch, an NBC universal spokesman said today.

 The spokesman was speaking to the Wall Street Journal newspaper, which reported that the initiative came from General Electric with the idea of blocking a possible move by Murdoch to compete with GEs financial television channel CNBC.

 The NBC Universal spokesman told the Wall Street Journal, itself the key asset in the Dow Jones group, that the two potential bidders had held exploratory talks that ended slightly more than a week ago. A spokesman for Microsoft, the US software group, declined to comment when questioned by the newspaper.

 The report said that Microsoft and General Electric had discussed the possibility of making a bid for Dow Jones, which also owns the Dow Jones Financial News agency, to match an offer by Rupert Murdochs News Corp of $5 billion on a basis of $60 per Dow Jones share.

 The newspaper said that GE had opened the talks because it was concerned that Murdoch wanted control of the Dow Jones assets to help him launch a financial news television channel to compete with the leading broadcaster in the field CNBC, a GE subsidiary.

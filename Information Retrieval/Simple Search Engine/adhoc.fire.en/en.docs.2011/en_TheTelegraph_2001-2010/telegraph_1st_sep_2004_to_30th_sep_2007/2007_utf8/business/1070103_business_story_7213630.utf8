 Teradata upbeat on growth trend

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, Jan. 2: Teradata Corporation, the $1.5-billion big daddy of global data warehousing, is banking on business from its international clients Wal-Mart, Tesco and Vodafone, which are likely to enter the country to sustain the triple-digit growth rate in India.

 Besides telecom and financial services, we expect retail to provide a major boom to our data warehousing business. With global clients like Wal-Mart hooking up with our Indian client Bharti, the business opportunities could be immense, said Stephen Brobst, global chief technology officer of Teradata, on a flying visit to the city.

 Even retail majors such as Tesco which is considering India and has its data warehousing system in the UK have remote access and usage provisions.

 Hutch uses Teradatas data warehousing system to manage its huge billing history and subscriber data, while Vodafone, in the news after its offer to pick up a stake in Hutchison Essar, also has Teradata behind its data models and is known to set up data warehouses in its country of active operations.

 Brobst said as more banks in India get their core banking systems in place, there would be a spurt in demand for structured data warehousing system and analytics.

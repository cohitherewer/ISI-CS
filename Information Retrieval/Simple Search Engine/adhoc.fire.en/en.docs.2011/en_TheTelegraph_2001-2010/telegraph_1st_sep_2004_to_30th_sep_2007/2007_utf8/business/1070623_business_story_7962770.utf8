 Ambani SEZs get the nod

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 22: The Centre today cleared 36 proposals for special economic zones (SEZs), including three of Mukesh Ambani and an infotech project of brother Anil.

 The board of approvals under the commerce ministry also granted an in-principle clearance to Ramky Infrastructure for a multi-product SEZ in Bengal. It was among the nine projects to receive an in-principle approval today.

 The three projects of Mukesh Ambani are in partnership with his aide Anand Jain. They are in biotechnology, light engineering and pharmaceuticals and will be spread over 346 hectares in Navi Mumbai.

 Around 63.74 hectares will be occupied by the biotechnology zone, 179 hectares by the light engineering SEZ and 103.25 hectares by the pharmaceutical project.

 Anil Ambani has received the green signal for the IT zone which will be spread over 18 hectares at Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City in Maharashtra.

 Mukesh is also planning a 1,250-hectare multi-product SEZ which is awaiting clearance from the board of approvals. 

 Commerce secretary G.K. Pillai, who is the chairman of the approval committee, said the promoters and the Maharashtra government have replied to the queries of the revenue department on the SEZ. These (the replies) have been circulated among the members of the board for consideration. The proposal will be taken up at the next meeting of the board on July 12. 

 Shantiniketan zone

 The proposal of Shantiniketan Infrastructure Pvt Ltd for an IT zone in Bolpur has received the green signal. To be spread over 80 hectares, the SEZ will be executed in the public-private partnership model. 

 The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation has a 26 per cent stake in the Shantiniketan project while four private companies will hold 18.5 per cent each. Along with the infotech park, the SEZ will also have 300-400 apartments for senior citizens.

 Ramky proposal

 The Ramky project will be spread over 1,012 hectares at Mahishadol, which is close to Nandigram where violent protests have erupted over the acquisition of land for a chemical SEZ.

 Pillai said the Ramky proposal was the first multi-product SEZ in Bengal to get the nod from the board of approvals.

 An in-principle approval means the promoter will have to acquire land and then come back to the Centre for final approval. Sources said given the tension at Nandigram, Ramky may find it difficult to get the land.

 Calcutta, April 10: Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL), the corporate entity of Vishakhapatnam Steel Plant, has posted an 18 per cent growth in profit before tax in 2006-07 on the back of a 8 per cent growth in sales.

 RINL chairman and managing director Y. Siva Sagar Rao said the sales turnover of Rs 9,126 crore was the highest for the company.

 Profit grew to Rs 2,246 crore from Rs 1,890 crore a year ago.

 The emphasis on sale of value-added products paid rich dividends. We sold about 1.1 million tonnes of value-added steel last year, which is a growth of 20 per cent over the previous year, he added.

 The company is also expanding its capacity to 6.3 million tonnes. It has placed orders worth Rs 3,500 crore for the same.

 Moreover, RINL is closing in on a steel plant in Chhattisgarh. Steel Authority of India Ltd chairman S.K. Roongta and NMDC chairman B. Ramesh Kumar would go to Vishakhapatnam in the next 10 days to discuss the project, Rao said. 

 The Union steel ministry has already given its approval for the project.

 The plant might have a two to three-million-tonne capacity. This will entail an investment of up to Rs 13,500 crore.

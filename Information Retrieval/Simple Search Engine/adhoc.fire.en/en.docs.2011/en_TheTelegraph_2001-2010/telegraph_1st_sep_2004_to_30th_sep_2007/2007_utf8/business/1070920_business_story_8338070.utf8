 mjunction services in good shape

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 19: The e-auction joint venture between Steel Authority of India Ltd and Tata Steel, mjunction services, is set to post a 50 per cent growth in transactions this fiscal.

 Viresh Oberoi, managing director of mjunction, said the company would report transactions worth Rs 12,000 crore this year against Rs 8,000 crore a year ago.

 Oberoi said the company was on an expansion drive. It has tied up with warehouse owners and logistic operators to service customers.

 mjunction sells coal, steel and other industrial and construction material online for companies such as SAIL, Tata Steel and Coal India.

 It also carries out procurement for many firms, including public sector units. 

 Oberoi said the company would strengthen its business-to-consumer channel through straightline.in and launch a promotional campaign for the online division.

 mjunction today tied up with city-based water tank maker Patton and cement manufacturer Lafarge to sell their products.

 New Delhi, July 19: Computer makers expect every second PC sold in India in the next three to four years to be a laptop.

 According to data released by the Manufacturers Association for Information Technology (MAIT), in 2006-07, 8.5 lakh laptops were sold, recording a growth of 97 per cent, while desktop sales rose 19 per cent to 54.90 lakh units.

 The total personal computer sales laptops and desktops registered a growth of 26 per cent in 2006-07 and are expected to retain this momentum next year with sales likely to hit 80 lakh units, said Vinnie Mehta, executive director of MAIT. A significant growth in the laptop segment pushed the total PC sales in the country to 63.4 lakh units in 2006-07 from over 50 lakh in the previous year.

 The ratio of laptops to desktops in India is 20:80. However, in West Europe, West Asia and Singapore, the ratio is 60:40, in favour of laptops. In mature markets like the US, the ratio is about 55:45 for laptops.

 The ratio will become 50:50 in the next few years with more users preferring laptops for increased portability, said industry analysts.

 We do expect laptop sales to overtake those of desktops in a few years though we cannot give a timeframe, said Mehta. Laptop prices are on a par with desktops. Some laptops of Acer, for instance, are available for below Rs 20,000.

 Laptop prices recently fell because of the rise in the rupee against the dollar, making component imports cheaper and lowering the duty on laptops. Most vendors such as HP, Dell and HCL Infosystems feel people are going in for laptops in the Rs 35,000 range.

 On the enterprise end, enhanced productivity with faster processors and increased portability and connectivity will be the prime drivers for increased adoption, said an analyst. 

 The business segment accounted for 74 per cent of the total PC sales, registering a growth rate of 18 per cent year-on-year, said the MAIT report.

 Sales to factories and small and medium enterprises remained low whereas large enterprises saw a growth of 69 per cent.

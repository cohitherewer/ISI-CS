 Calcutta, April 4: Coal India subsidiary Bharat Coking Coal will form a joint venture with the Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) for mining two million tonnes of coking coal every year.

 The management of SAILs plant in Burnpur (erstwhile IISCO) recently approached us and are willing to invest in the underground coking coal mining project, said Bharat Coking Coal chairman and managing director A.K. Paul at a press meet here today.

 The site for the proposed joint venture mine has been identified near our existing Moonidih mine, he said. 

 The geological survey of the project has already been prepared and the identified area is estimated to have a reserve of 50 million tonnes of coking coal, Paul added. 

 The initial cost to set up the mine would be Rs 500 crore, of which SAIL has agreed to invest Rs 300 crore. The rest will be contributed by BCCL, he explained. 

 According to Paul, the detailed project report is being prepared and the joint venture proposal would soon be sent to the BCCL board for its approval. 

 Following the approval of the boards of both the companies, expressions of interest would be invited from global companies to develop the mine, supply mining equipment and mine two million tonnes of coal a year. The arrangement would be based on revenue sharing, Paul said. 

 SAIL will purchase the entire quantity of coal mined from this project. 

 Two years ago, Tata Steel also evinced interest to invest in a joint venture coking coal mining project with BCCL. But the idea was nipped in the bud.

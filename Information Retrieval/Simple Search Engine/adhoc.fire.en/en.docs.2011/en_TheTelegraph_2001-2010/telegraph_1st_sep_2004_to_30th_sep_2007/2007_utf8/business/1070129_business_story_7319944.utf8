 India growth story here to stay

 Higher and higher

 Perhaps the major debate about the Indian economy is whether the current spurt of 8 per cent plus growth is cyclical or structural in nature. 

 At one extreme are those who firmly believe that the surge is due to the lax global monetary conditions that led to a wave of liquidity across markets. This depressed interest rates across the world, leading to a rise in consumption demand. With the turning of the tide, say these pessimists, carry trades will dwindle, liquidity will dry up and interest rates will rise, leading to the end of the consumption boom. 

 Last year, the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister took a look at that argument and accepted that much of the spurt in growth was the result of higher consumption. But it also argued that higher consumption was leading to higher investment and that any slowdown in consumption growth would be made up by growth in investment demand.

 A recent paper from Goldman Sachs now adds new evidence to prove that Indias boom is here to stay. One of the criticisms of the Asian miracle is famously expounded by Paul Krugman in his paper titled The Myth of the Asian Miracle. This is what he had to say about Singapores growth spurt: All of Singapores growth can be explained by increases in measured inputs. There is no sign at all of increased efficiency.

 Thankfully, the Goldman Sachs paper says the Indian economy is actually increasing its productivity. It says, We find that, since 2003, there has been a structural increase in Indias potential growth to nearly 8 per cent from 5 per cent to 6 per cent in the previous two decades. Productivity growth has been the key driver behind the jump in GDP growth, contributing to nearly half of overall growth since 2003, compared with a contribution of roughly one-quarter in the 1980s and 1990s. 

 Even more encouragingly, much of the rise in efficiency has occurred in manufacturing. According to the paper, total factor productivity in Indian industry improved from 1.2 per cent per annum during 1997-2002 to 1.9 per cent over the period 2002-2004. Agriculture, on the other hand, remains mired in negative growth in total factor productivity. Indian labour is four times more productive in industry than in agriculture and six times more productive in services.

 The big question is, will the productivity growth be sustained? 

 Goldman Sachs believes so, pointing out that India has benefited from greater openness and integration with the global economy. The paper points out that since Indian tariff barriers are still relatively high and the trade/GDP ratio is still small, productivity gains from further trade integration still has some distance to run. 

 Other reasons for optimism include migration from low-productivity agriculture to high-productivity industry and services, transforming the productivity of land through SEZs, the spillover effect from the success of the IT industry and the road-building programme.

 What about the risks to growth? 

 The paper lists the usual ones, but says, Strong economic performance has been achieved during a period of rising oil prices and with the economy remaining relatively closed. A high level of reserves, a falling fiscal deficit, low external debt, and a low current account deficit give further reassurance about the underlying strength of the current growth momentum. 

 In other words, the optimism in the stock market is fully justified by the fundamentals.

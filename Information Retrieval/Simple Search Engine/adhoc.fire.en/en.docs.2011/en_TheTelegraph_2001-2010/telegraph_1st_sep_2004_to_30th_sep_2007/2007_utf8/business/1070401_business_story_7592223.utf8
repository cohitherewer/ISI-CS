 ISD rates cut

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, March 31: Cellular operators Hutch and Bharti Airtel today reduced isd rates by 80 paise per minute, following the Telecom Regulatory Authority of Indias (Trai) decision to reduce the access deficit (ADC) charge by 37 per cent. ADC is a levy paid by private operators to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) for rolling out telecom services in rural areas. The rates are effective from tonight.

 Hutch and Airtel consumers will now have to pay Rs 6.40 per minute for calls to the us and Canada instead of the earlier Rs 7.20 and Rs 9.19 for other destinations instead of Rs 9.99. 

 Meanwhile, BSNL today moved the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) against the Trai decision to cut the levy paid to it by private operators for promoting telecom services in rural areas. TDSAT chairman Justice Arun Kumar has issued a notice to Trai and directed them to file a reply on the petition. 

 The mobile operators associations, Auspi and COAI, also moved a plea to be impleaded in the case. 

 The tribunal has asked them to file an application and submit a list of their members who wanted to be party to it. 

 Since 2003, private telecom operators have been paying BSNL an access deficit charge (ADC) to offset the cost incurred by the public sector firm in operations in rural areas. 

 TRAI had, on March 21 this year, announced a 37 per cent reduction in ADC for 2007-08 to Rs 2,000 crore from Rs 3,200 crore earlier. The new rates would to be effective from April 1. TRAI plans to remove ADC in toto in 2008-09. 

 BSNL has contended in its petition that TRAI has framed the new interconnect usage charges regulation without considering the relevant circumstances and taking into account of irrelevant factors. 

 However, a reliance spokesperson declined to comment to a query whether the company will follow suit.

 Soon after the announcement of the adc cut, bharti had termed it a positive move for the customers and officials had said bharti airtel had always been passing on the benefits of any such taxes or levies reduction to the customer. More pti ana hk 03311924 del

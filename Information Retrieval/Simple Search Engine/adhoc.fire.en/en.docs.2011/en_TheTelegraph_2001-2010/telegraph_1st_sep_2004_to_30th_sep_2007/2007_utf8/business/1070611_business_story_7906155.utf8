 Firms draw line on roaming relief

 JAYATI GHOSE

 Put on hold

 New Delhi, June 10: Telecom companies such as Bharti Airtel, Hutch and Idea are not in favour of slashing roaming rates to woo customers. This is because the subscriber base is witnessing a steady rise of 5 per cent every month even in the absence of such cuts.

 We have a substantial subscriber base among high networth individuals. Hence, reducing the roaming rates will not make a difference, a Bharti Airtel official said. At the higher end, the quality of service is more important than the rates, he added.

 According to Kunal Bajaj, director of telecom consultancy firm BDA India, The masses do not use roaming services extensively so as to get attracted by low roaming tariffs. The high networth individuals will not be enticed to switch operators just on the basis of low rates.

 Moreover, the cut in roaming charges is accompanied by an increase in the monthly rental. So, most subscribers prefer to stick to their existing operators, analysts said. The bill is also not a problem for most GSM subscribers, they added. 

 Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd have reduced the roaming rates on the Rs 550 post-paid plan. Reliance Communications also recently slashed its roaming rates.

 Bajaj, however, feels that given the competition in the sector, Bharti Airtel, Hutch and Idea will also have to bring down the rates. The roaming tariff makes up for more than 20 per cent of a telecom companys revenues. 

 BSNL, MTNL and Reliance Communications expect the new roaming charges to increase their traffic by 20 to 25 per cent.

 However, the GSM players are not in favour of slashing roaming rates. This may not go down well with the regulator and the government.

 In January, while imposing a cap on roaming tariffs, Trai had said, Evidence available on tariff for roaming services reveal that there is a coordinated arrangement in the pricing of the services among GSM providers. In many instances, changes in the roaming tariff had been effected almost simultaneously.

 It is quite likely that there is a meeting of minds among GSM operators and no cartel operating. But they will have to convince the regulator, which still finds the roaming tariffs to be high.

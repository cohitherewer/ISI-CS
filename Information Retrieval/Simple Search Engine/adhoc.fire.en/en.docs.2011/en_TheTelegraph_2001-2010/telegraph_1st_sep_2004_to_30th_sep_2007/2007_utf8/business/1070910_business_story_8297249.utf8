 ICICI eyes big role in buyouts

 Mumbai, Sept. 9 (PTI): ICICI Bank today said it would have a role to play in 70 per cent of the mergers and acquisitions by Indian companies abroad.

 Indian companies made overseas acquisitions worth $20 billion in 2006. That level was surpassed during the first six months of 2007. Even on a conservative note, overseas mergers and acquisitions are expected to reach $30-35 billion this year, ICICI deputy managing director Chanda Kochhar said.

 ICICI Banks involvement be it advisory, lending or syndication of loans accounted for 70 per cent of the deals in the first half of the year and we hope to maintain this market share, she added.

 Kochhar said the bank helped companies raise $24 billion in overseas borrowings last year. It was quite possible for ICICI Bank to be counted among the top 25 global banks, she added. ICICI Bank was the top banker in helping Indian companies raise syndicated loans through ECBs, a segment dominated by foreign banks till two to three years ago, she added.

 ICICI Bank itself will pursue the organic route for faster growth. 

 Globally, we are too small. But any global step should be a big one. Before that the right strategy will be to grow organically till we reach the next level. Even presuming that we grow by a conservative rate of 25-30 per cent, we can easily double the overseas business in two to three years, she said. 

 The bank overtook the State Bank of India in overseas assets this year with a book size of about $19 billion. Kochhar did not rule out the possibility of doubling the asset size to $38 billion in about two years.

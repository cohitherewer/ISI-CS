The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Trick from banker to poor

 The following are excerpts from Part B, which deals with taxes, of the finance ministers budget speech.

 INDIRECT TAXES

 I shall begin with indirect taxes. First, customs duties.

 In order to take one more step towards comparable East Asian rates, I propose to reduce the peak rate for non-agricultural products from 12.5 per cent to 10 per cent.

 I propose to reduce the duties on most chemicals and plastics from 12.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent.

 The duty on prime steel is 5 per cent. Seconds and defectives augment supply. Keeping in mind the need for a differential, I propose to reduce the duty on seconds and defectives of steel from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.

 I propose to fully exempt from duty all coking coal irrespective of the ash content.

 I propose to reduce the customs duty on polyester fibres and yarns from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent. Consequently, the customs duty on raw materials such as DMT, PTA and MEG will also be reduced from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent.

 I propose to bring down the duty on cut and polished diamonds from 5 per cent to 3 per cent; on rough synthetic stones from 12.5 per cent to 5 per cent; and on unworked corals from 30 per cent to 10 per cent.

 I propose to reduce the duty on drip irrigation systems, agricultural sprinklers and food processing machinery from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent.

 While specified medical equipment attract a concessional duty of 5 per cent, other equipment are taxed at 12.5 per cent. I propose to bring down the general rate of import duty on medical equipment to 7.5 per cent.

 In order to make edible oils more affordable, I propose to exempt crude as well as refined edible oils from the additional CV duty of 4 per cent. I also propose to reduce the duty on sunflower oil, both crude and refined, by 15 percentage points.

 In order to promote research and development, I propose to extend the concessional rate of 5 per cent duty available to public funded research institutions to all research institutions registered with the Directorate of Scientific and Industrial Research. 

 For the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector, I propose to reduce the duty on 15 specified machinery from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent.

 Import of aircraft, including helicopters, by government and scheduled airlines is, at present, exempt from all duties, and that position will continue. However, there is no reason to allow the exemption to other private importers. Hence, I propose to levy an import duty of 3 per cent, which is the WTO-bound rate, on all private import of aircraft including helicopters. Such import will also attract countervailing duty and additional customs duty.

 The Hoda Committee has submitted a report on mineral policy. Taking a leaf out of the report, and in order to conserve our natural resources as well as to raise revenue, I propose to impose an export duty of Rs 300 per metric tonne on export of iron ores and concentrates and Rs 2,000 per metric tonne on export of chrome ores and concentrates.

 Excise amp; service

 tax

 There will be no change in the general Cenvat rate or in the service tax rate.

 On February 15, 2007, the government reduced the price of petrol and diesel by Rs 2 per litre and Re 1 per litre, respectively. I had agreed that the Revenue will bear a part of the burden. I propose to reduce the ad valorem component of excise duty on petrol and diesel from 8 per cent to 6 per cent.

 I propose to raise the exemption limit for small scale industry (SSI) from Rs 1 crore to Rs 1.5 crore. 

 The food processing sector is poised to achieve high growth. Concessions were extended last year to several items of food. This year, I propose to fully exempt from excise duty biscuits whose retail sale price does not exceed Rs 50 per kilogram. 

 I propose to reduce excise duty on umbrellas and parts of footwear from 16 per cent to 8 per cent.

 Plywood helps to save wood. Hence, I propose to reduce excise duty on plywood from 16 per cent to 8 per cent.

 Biodiesel will greatly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Hence, I propose to fully exempt biodiesel from excise duty.

 I propose to fully exempt from excise duty water purification devices operating on specified membrane-based technologies as well as domestic water filters not using electricity.

 Cement prices

 I propose to reward cement manufacturers who hold the price line and tax those who do not. Accordingly, I propose to reduce the present rate of excise duty of Rs 400 per tonne to Rs 350 per tonne on cement which is sold in retail at not more than Rs 190 per bag. On cement that has a higher MRP, the excise duty will be Rs 600 per metric tonne.

 Tobacco twist

 I strongly support the campaign say no to tobacco. Hence, I propose to increase the specific rates of excise duty on cigarettes by about 5 per cent. Similarly, excise duty (excluding cess) on bidis, which was last fixed in 2001, will be raised from Rs 7 to Rs 11 per thousand for non-machine made bidis and from Rs 17 to Rs 24 per thousand for machine made bidis. 

 Pan masala containing tobacco will continue to bear an excise duty of 66 per cent. However, in the case of pan masala not containing tobacco, the duty will be reduced from 66 per cent to 45 per cent. I also propose to withdraw the exemption for pan masala containing tobacco and other tobacco products that is now given to units in the northeastern states.

 Service tax relief

 I propose to raise the exemption limit for small service providers from Rs 400,000 to Rs 800,000. Consequently, 200,000 assessees out of a total of 400,000 assessees will go out of the service tax net. The revenue loss will be Rs 800 crore, but I am happy to give away this sum in the interest of the small service provider and the consumer.

 Service tax widened

 While I bid goodbye to 200,000 assessees, I welcome the new assessees who will be brought into the fold. I propose to extend service tax to:

 Services outsourced for mining of mineral, oil or gas;

 Renting of immovable property for use in commerce or business; however, residential properties, vacant land used for agriculture and similar purposes, land for sports, entertainment and parking purposes, and immovable property for educational or religious purposes will be excluded;

 Development and supply of content for use in telecom and advertising purposes;

 Asset management services

 provided by individuals; and Design services.

 State governments levy a tax on the transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of a works contract. The value of services in a works contract should attract service tax. Hence, I propose to levy service tax on services involved in the execution of a works contract.

 However, I also propose an optional composition scheme under which service tax will be levied at only 2 per cent of the total value of the works contract.

 I propose to exempt service tax on services provided by resident welfare associations to their members who contribute Rs 3,000 or less per month for services rendered.

 In order to encourage innovation, I propose to exempt from service tax all services provided by technology business incubators. Similarly, their incubatees whose annual business turnover does not exceed Rs 50 lakh will be exempt from service tax for the first three years.

 To make India a preferred destination for drug testing, I propose to exempt clinical trial of new drugs from service tax.

 DIRECT TAXES

 Income-tax

 I propose that:

 The threshold limit of exemption in the case of all assessees be increased by Rs 10,000, thus giving every assessee a relief of Rs 1,000;

 Consequently, in the case of a woman assessee, the threshold limit be increased from Rs 135,000 to Rs 145,000, giving her a relief of Rs 1,000;

 The threshold limit of exemption in the case of a senior citizen be increased from Rs 185,000 to Rs 195,000, giving him or her a relief of Rs 2,000; and

 The deduction in respect of medical insurance premium under Section 80D be increased to a maximum of Rs 15,000 and, in the case of a senior citizen, a maximum of Rs 20,000.

 I propose to remove the surcharge on income-tax on all firms and companies with a taxable income of Rs 1 crore or less. This will benefit about 1,200,000 firms and companies.

 On the MAT

 In 1996-97, we introduced the Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) for companies with book profits, and its purpose is to bring about horizontal equity in taxation. MAT should therefore apply, as far as possible, to all corporate incomes. Hence, I propose to extend MAT to income in respect of which deduction is claimed under sections 10A and 10B of the Income Tax Act.

 I also propose to partially modify a deduction that is available to certain companies. Without altering the overall limit of the special reserve equal to twice the net worth under section 36(1)(viii) of the Income Tax Act, I propose to stretch out the period by restricting the deduction to 20 per cent of the profits each year and limit the benefit to banks and certain financial corporations.

 In December 2006, I put a limit of Rs 50 lakh per investor per year with respect to capital gains bonds issued by NHAI and REC under section 54EC of the Income Tax Act. As a result, many small investors could obtain these bonds and save on capital gains. I propose to continue this provision and, accordingly, I propose to amend section 54EC to that effect.

 Dividend tax

 Having regard to the capacity to pay, I propose to raise the rate of dividend distribution tax from 12.5 per cent to 15 per cent on dividends distributed by companies.

 Dividends distributed by money market mutual funds and liquid mutual funds enjoy concessional tax rates giving rise to huge arbitrage opportunities. I propose to address this distortion by raising the dividend distribution tax on dividends paid by such entities to 25 per cent for all investors.

 Fringe benefit tax (FBT) has now stabilised. I have received a few representations regarding some aspects of sales promotion. Hence, I propose to clarify the doubts by excluding expenditure on free samples as well as expenditure on displays from the scope of FBT.

 Esop under FBT

 A number of companies provide fringe benefits to employees through Employees Stock Option Plan (Esop). I propose to bring Esops under FBT. The value of the fringe benefit will be determined, in accordance with a prescribed method, on the date of exercise of the option.

 Cash withdrawal tax

 The Banking Cash Transactions Tax (BCTT) continues to be an extremely useful tool to track unaccounted monies and trace their source and destination. It has led the income-tax department to many money laundering and hawala transactions. 

 Having regard to the experience gained, I propose to exclude cash withdrawals by the central and state governments from the scope of BCTT. Further, I propose to raise the exemption limit for individuals and HUFs from Rs 25,000 to Rs 50,000.

 Quota cess

 While the cess of 2 per cent on all taxes to fund basic education will remain, I propose to levy an additional cess of 1 per cent on all taxes to fund secondary education and higher education and the expansion of capacity by 54 per cent for reservation for socially and educationally backward classes.

 I believe that, given a right mix of policies, the poor will benefit from growth that is driven by savings and investment and that is more inclusive. As Dr Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel laureate, said: Faster growth rate is essential for faster reduction in poverty. There is no other trick to it.

 Sir, with these words, I commend the budget to the House.

 Oil team to lobby FM for tax sops 

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Chidambaram: Gameplan

 New Delhi, Jan. 22: Petroleum minister Murli Deora and the CEOs of national oil companies will take finance minister P. Chidambaram through some number crunching exercises tomorrow to obtain tax concessions for the hydrocarbon sector in the budget.

 The meeting will also take up grant of infrastructure status to natural gas and oil pipeline projects. Gas pipelines will then be under Section 80 1A of the Income-Tax Act, giving investments in the projects a 10-year tax holiday. 

 The concessions, which are on the cards, will be a boon to Reliance and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation, which have plans for pipelines to ferry gas from oil blocks. ONGC and GAIL (India) will also benefit from the move.

 Downstream companies such as Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum will benefit if the concessions are extended to crude oil and product pipelines. The PSUs are expanding their pipeline network, which is a more efficient form of transportation than by road or rail.

 The petroleum ministry will also lobby for a cut in customs duty on crude to protect the oil PSUs, which are heavy losers when crude prices go up since they sell LPG and kerosene at subsidised rates and are often forced to defer price hike on petrol and diesel. 

 The customs duty on crude, whose rates are determined on an ad valorem basis, shoots up when global prices of crude rise, raising the burden on oil PSUs. 

 Similarly, while the government does not allow oil PSUs to raise the prices of petroleum products, it rakes in more revenue when prices rise due to the high incidence of excise duties on these goods. 

 The petroleum minister will also seek concessions on the 12.5 per cent service charge on companies offering drilling and other services, such as offshore vessels for logistic support, to outfits in oil and gas exploration.

 The service charge is passed on to exploration companies, raising their costs and reducing the incentive to strike oil. The petroleum ministry has also made out a case for extending the tax holiday from seven years to 10 on companies making oil and gas discoveries in the country.

 Specific duty

 Deora is seeking a shift to specific duties on fuel from the current mix of ad valorem and specific duties.

 The current excise duty on petrol is 8.16 per cent of ex-factory price plus Rs 13.26 a litre, while for diesel it is 8.16 per cent plus Rs 3.32 a litre. The ministry has suggested a specific duty of Rs 15.92 for petrol and Rs 6.08 per litre for diesel in the forthcoming budget.

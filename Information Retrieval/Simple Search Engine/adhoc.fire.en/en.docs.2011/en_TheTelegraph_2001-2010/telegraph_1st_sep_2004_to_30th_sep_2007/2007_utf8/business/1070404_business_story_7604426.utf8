 Duty-cut salvo at cement firms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi, April 3: With cement makers refusing to cut prices, the government today announced it was abolishing the 16 per cent countervailing duty and 4 per cent special additional duty on portland cement. 

 The government had earlier reduced the basic import tariff on cement to zero from 12.5 per cent but kept the special tariff on imports. Central Board of Excise and Customs spokesperson Hemambika Priya told newspersons here today that the scrapping of the levies will make portland cement completely duty-free.

 In this years budget, the government had also introduced differential excise tariff to get cement makers to reduce prices. 

 The budget proposed an excise duty of Rs 600 per tonne if cement costs more than Rs 190 per 50-kg bag and a lower duty of Rs 350 if the cost was less than Rs 190.

 This put the industry on a warpath with the government as within a day of the budget, cement makers raised prices and weathered the government pressure to roll back the price rise. 

 After series of parleys, the industry, however, agreed to hold the price line for a year.

 Priya today denied that the government was trying to force the industry to toe its line. Priya instead indicated that the government was open to reviewing the differential tariff when changes are made to taxation proposals in the budget.

 Analysts feel that the government is following a carrot and stick policy with the industry. The move is likely to make imported cement marginally cheaper than domestic cement. Cement prices on an average increased to Rs 220 per 50-kg bag in March from Rs 165 in January and Rs 209 in February, a government release said.

 It is expected that the present move will improve the supply situation in the country, the release added. The government has already invited proposals from the industry to moderate prices. The government expects that cement manufacturers, in the larger interests of consumers and for checking inflation, will take appropriate measures to moderate prices.

 Sources added the government was likely to reduce the 10 per cent import duty on other grades of cement. 

 Analysts are, however, sceptical of the impact of the duty cuts. As cement is a very light commodity in terms of volume to weight, it becomes extremely costly to import from far away areas. Only imports from the Gulf and Southeast Asia are likely to be cost effective, said analysts.

 The government collected Rs 4,777 crore in excise revenues during 2005-06 and Rs 4,348 crore during 2006-07 till the end of February from cement.

 Domestic cement consumption has increased by 9.9 per cent to 121.19 million tonnes in 2006-07, and only a small portion of which is met by imports.

 Sensex bids adieu to boom-boom returns

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, May 27: The BSE sensex could flirt with 15000 this year. But if that excites you, then mull this: the sensex ought to have been above 20000 by now. The sensex rose from 100 to 5005.82 between April 1979 the base year in reference to which the bellwether stock price index was constituted and December 1999.

 The stock price index thus yielded a compounded annual return of 21.61 per cent over those 20 years. This is, however, excluding the dividends that investors received during that period. If it had continued to grow at that rate, the sensex would rise to 250530.73 by the end of 2019 and to 19690.66 by December 2006.

 In contrast, the index closed the last calendar year at 13786.91 almost 6000 points lower than that predicted despite a huge run up in stock prices over the last three years. A closer look at the decadal gains of the sensex reveals that stock prices gave a better return during the pre-reform period than in the post-reform years. 

 The sensex, which was first compiled in 1986 with 1978-79 as the base year, gave an annual compounded return of 23.59 per cent till 1990. The economic growth rate of the country also started accelerating steadily since 1978-79, which was also the year of zero inflation in the country. However, the high return from stock investments in the 1980s came about because of the spectacular jump in GDP growth to 5.5 per cent from 3 per cent in 1970s. 

 Economic reforms in the 1990s, however, could not lift the economic growth to a significantly higher level the annual GDP growth rate in the 1990s was 5.9 per cent against 5.5 per cent in the 1980s. Besides, the inflation rate during these years was also higher at 8.13 per cent versus 7.97 per cent in the 1980s. 

 Finally, the Harshad Mehta scam threw the stock markets into reverse gear. All these saw the compounded annual growth rate in the sensex tapering to 19.24 per cent between 1991 and 1999. 

 The new millennium began on the notes of an ongoing economic slowdown that lasted till 2003. From 2003-04 till date, economic growth has been spectacular clocking over 8 per cent on an annualised basis. This led to the huge built up in stock prices over the last couple of years. However, the annualised gains in the sensex continued to taper off to 15.57 per cent so far in the new millennium. 

 That brings us to a crunch question: what sort of returns can investors expect in the years ahead? You should not expect the 35 to 40 per cent return that the sensex had given over the last few years, says Sanjay Sinha, chief investment officer-designate and head of equities at SBI Mutual Fund. 

 However,investors can expect a 15 to 17 per cent annual rate of return on a conservative basis over the next five to seven years.

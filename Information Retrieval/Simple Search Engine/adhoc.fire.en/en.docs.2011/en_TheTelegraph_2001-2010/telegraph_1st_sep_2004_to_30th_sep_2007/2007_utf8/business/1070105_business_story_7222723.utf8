 Ready-made garments get cess relief

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: The government today decided to abolish the textile committee cess on ready-made garments. The move is a major relief for exporters.

 The exemption will rationalise cess and tax burden on ready-made garments and improve their competitiveness in global markets, information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said after a cabinet meeting.

 The cess, which works out to 0.05 per cent of the production value of the textile industry, is used to fund the textile committees promotional activity. The committee was set up by an act of Parliament.

 However, the industry had been complaining that the cess had outlived its utility and collections were far in excess of what was required to sustain its activities.

 The collections from the cess adds up to Rs 42 crore in a year and ready-made garments account for half of it, according to industry sources.

 Welcoming the abolition of the cess from ready-made garments, the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry said it would have been better if the entire industry was exempted from it.

 We will have to start our campaign afresh to get the entire textile industry out of the purview of the cess, CITI general secretary D.K. Nair said. 

 The government also notified the partial lifting of ban on sugar exports today. 

 The notification by the Director General of Foreign Trade would allow exports against advance licences that stipulates re-export of white sugar against import of raw sugar.

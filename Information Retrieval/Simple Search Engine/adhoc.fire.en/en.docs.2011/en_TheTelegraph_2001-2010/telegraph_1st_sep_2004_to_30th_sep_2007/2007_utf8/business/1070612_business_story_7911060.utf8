 BMW, Mercedes to bond

 Berlin, June 11 (AFP): BMW wants to intensify cooperation with its fellow German car maker Mercedes, a top BMW executive said.

 Cooperation is a good approach, said Michael Ganal, BMW sales and marketing chief, as it allows each group its freedom, he told Wirtschaftswoche.

 The two brands are in the luxury segment, they both are high-tech, they are both independent but they are not the biggest car makers, he said. 

 Ganal declined to say which areas BMW and Mercedes, owned by DaimlerChrysler, the increased cooperation would come. 

 The two firms already collaborate, together with General Motors, on the development of hybrid cars. The magazine also said that BMW was looking at introducing a fourth brand alongside BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce, and that it was interested by GMs Volvo unit. A spokesman for Volvo declined to comment.

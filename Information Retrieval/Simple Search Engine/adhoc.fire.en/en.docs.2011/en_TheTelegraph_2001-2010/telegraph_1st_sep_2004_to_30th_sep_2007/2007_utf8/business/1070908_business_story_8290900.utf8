The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Managing new India

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 7: Challenges faced by the managers of new India is the focus of the three-day 34th national convention being organised by AIMA and AAMO in the city.

 With rapid expansion taking place in every sector, managing new India has become synonymous with managing growth, said Subir Raha, president of AIMA.

 The challenges faced by the managers include risk management and the stress of working across time zones. 

 Appetite for risk has increased. And as a result, risk management has become an issue of crucial importance, Raha said.

 New India is also about managing diverse businesses, feels convention chairman Sanjiv Goenka, who is vice-chairman of CESC. The power utility is the flagship of RPG Enterprises, which has gone from power to retail and real estate.

 Managing diverse businesses is nothing new to RPG. The range is wide and there is no reason why each business will not be complementary to another, said Goenka.

 Speaking about the shortage of skilled manpower in the retail sector, Goenka said: There is a sharp rise in the demand for experienced people in the retail business, one of the fastest growing sectors.

 He feels management institutions can play a significant role in bridging the gap, as they have the flexibility to produce graduates who can trigger a boom in the retail business.

 Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman, who is co-chairman of the convention, said, The core values that drive all business decisions even today are integrity, understanding, excellence, unity and responsibility. Tata Steel, he added, had introduced an extensive document called Code of Conduct to monitor its employees across all levels and centres.

 B-schools across the world are emphasising business ethics, which is definitely of utmost importance in the management and smooth functioning of a company, Muthuraman said.

 Higher plan outlay to enliven tea

 Calcutta, Jan. 10: The Centre is set to treble the outlay on tea from Rs 350 crore during the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002-2007) to Rs 1,000 crore during the Eleventh Plan (2007-2012).

 This outlay would also include a part of the Rs 4,760-crore special purpose tea fund for rejuvenation and replantation.

 The Eleventh Plan would focus on this fund to improve productivity, which suffers as 38 per cent of the area under plantation has bushes more than 50 years old. After a five-year cycle of rejuvenation and replantation, the productivity should go up between 30 and 50 per cent. This is crucial if we have to get back our export markets, said Jairam Ramesh, minister of state for commerce and industry, here today.

 India has already lost out to Sri Lanka in Russia while Kenya has taken over the Pakistan market. The special purpose fund, which would cover 1,600 gardens and 800 owners, would disburse loans based on the cash flow of the gardens and not their balance sheets.

 The first loan agreement under the fund would be signed on June 1 in the city.

 The state government has provided us with the list of garden owners who are PF defaulters. An undertaking on the clearance of such statutory dues within a given period is required for a garden to be applicable for the fund, Ramesh said.

 Exports to Pakistan

 Ramesh said he wanted to increase tea exports to Pakistan to 30-35 million kg in the next three years from 14 million kg last year. A delegation would most likely visit Pakistan in April.

 Marketing centre

 For the first time, a tea marketing centre in Egypt would be opened by March-end in Cairo in partnership between the Tea Board and the industry.

 Tea is very much on the agenda of our external affairs ministers visit to Pakistan, Ramesh added.

 Ramesh has planned the India International Tea Fair in November in the city.

 It was last held in 2003 and would henceforth be a bi-annual global event in Calcutta with satellite events in Darjeeling and Jorhat.

 E-auction

 The consultant for the e-auction process would be decided in February while the software for the system would be in place by November.

 Small growers

 The Board will fund a study to be conducted by the state department of land on the small growers who contribute 10 per cent to Bengals output. Ramesh requested the chief minister to look whether the land deeds for these growers could be formalised so that they could avail of financial assistance.

 Russian firm in Pepsi bottle 

 Moscow, Aug. 13 (Reuters): The worlds No. 2 soft drink firm PepsiCo has agreed to buy Russias top juice maker Lebedyansky for $1.5-2 billion to boost its modest Russian juice market share, a newspaper reported on Monday.

 Kommersant business daily said the deal would take place before the year end, and PepsiCo would buy over 76 per cent of Lebedyansky for $1.5-$2 billion, implying a possible premium to its market capitalisation, which at Fridays closing price was $1.95 billion for the whole company.

 A spokesman for Lebedyansky declined to comment. PepsiCo was not available to comment. The news sent shares in Lebedyansky up 7 per cent to 2,600 roubles ($102).

 PepsiCo controls around a fifth of the Russian soft drinks market and around a third of potato chip sales, but currently controls just 2 per cent of the Russian juice market through the Tropicana brand.

 PepsiCos main rival Coca-Cola controls over a fifth of the Russian juice market after the $530-million purchase of producer Multon in 2005.

 PepsiCo has no juice-producing assets in Russia, and Lebedyansky, which controls over 30 per cent of the Russian juice market, is seen as an attractive target for the beverage giant.

 Analysts said the deal could have become more likely after private equity group Lion Capital agreed to buy PepsiCos previous target, Russias No. 3 fruit juice maker, Nidan Soki.

 We have long seen Lebedyansky, with its leading market position in juice and its best-in-class distribution system, as an attractive takeover target for international food and beverage companies, Alfa Bank said in a note.

 About 23 per cent of Lebedyansky shares are freely floated, while 76 per cent are controlled by a group of Russian businessmen, including former director Nikolay Bortsov and his son Yuri, the firms chairman.

 Kommersant said Deutsche Bank was advising PepsiCo on the deal.

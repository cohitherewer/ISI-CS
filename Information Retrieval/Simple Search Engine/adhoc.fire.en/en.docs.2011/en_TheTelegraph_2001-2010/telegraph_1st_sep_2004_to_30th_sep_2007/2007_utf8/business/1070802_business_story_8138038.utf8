 Posco clears green hurdle

 Calcutta/Bhubaneswar, Aug. 1: South Koreas Posco has received environmental clearance from the Centre for its proposed 12-million-tonne steel plant in Orissa.

 The ministry of environment and forest gave its approval to Posco India on July 19, following which it published a notification in an Oriya newspaper inviting comments and objection, if any.

 The 10-day period ended on July 30 and the company received no objections to the project. As a result, Posco India is free to start work on the first phase of the project that involves a 4-million-tonne plant and 400mw captive power plant, a Posco spokesperson said.

 According to the conditions laid down by the environment ministry, Posco has to spend the Rs 1,525 crore earmarked for environmental pollution control measures judiciously as stipulated by the Centre and the state.

 In April, the ministry granted its approval under the coastal regulation zone to the Korean companys proposal to set up a captive port at Jatadhari at a cost of Rs 17,113 crore.

 Observers say the clearance for the Environmental Impact Assessment study is a milestone for Posco but the company has to negotiate some other serious issues before it actually starts construction. For instance, more than 3,000 acres of the 4,004-acre land it chose for the project is notified as forest area.

 The forest land has to be denotified to set up the unit. To tackle the issue, it has worked out a forest diversion plan, which has been approved by the state and forwarded to the Centre for approval.

 Officials said the company was likely to receive a clearance from the environment ministry for diversion of 3,200 acres of forest land shortly. 

 The forest advisory committee (FAC) constituted by the ministry of environment amp; forests under Section 3 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 will meet this month to give its clearance.

 But that again may not have any meaning as the committee has been made a toothless body with the Supreme Court having the final say on whether the forest diversion clearance accorded by the committee is valid or not. The apex court will seek the opinion of a centrally empowered committee (CEC), a quasi-judicial body appointed by it, before it passes a final order. In the Vedanta Alumina Refinery case, the CEC had advised that Vedantas mining of bauxite ore on Niyamgiri mountain hilltop in Lanjigarh would adversely affect the environment. 

 So like the Vedanta project, Poscos steel project can be delayed at the doorsteps of the apex court. The clearance may be delayed further if any environmental body challenges the FAC decision in the Apex Court.

 However, the real worry for the Rs 52,000-crore project is the displacement issue. It is now two years since Posco signed an MoU with the Orissa government but is yet to secure the land to build the plant as villagers of three panchayats have refused entry to government officials.

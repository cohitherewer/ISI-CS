 Inflation stays put at 6.46%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 30: Rising prices of cement and edible oils have ensured that the countrys inflation rate stuck to a stubborn 6.46 per cent for the third consecutive week ended March 17, according to official data released today. The rate was a mere 3.69 per cent during the same week last year.

 The government is extremely worried as rising prices could have an adverse impact on the poll prospects of the Congress in Uttar Pradesh. 

 While the inflation rate is based on wholesale price index, the increase in retail prices which consumers pay are normally much higher.

 For the week under consideration, prices of fruits, vegetables, wheat, arhar, barley among food products declined, while those for poultry chicken, bajra, masur, fish-marine and jowar rose.

 In manufactured product category, there was a rise in prices of cement, on which the government and cement makers held a few meetings without much success. Rates of various kinds of edible oils also appreciated.

 Prices of some minerals like ochre, fluorite and magnesite shot up exorbitantly in the range of 22-33 per cent.

 The inflation data for the week ended March 17 is the first after the Asian Development Bank projected economic growth to shrink to 8 per cent next fiscal, owing to tight monetary policy to contain overheating. The multilateral funding agency had also forecast that inflation would reduce to a tolerable 5 per cent in the next two years.

 Wholesale price index, on which inflation data is based, rose by 0.05 per cent to 209.4 points during the week from 209.3 points in previous week.

 Govt wants full details of perks in Form 16 

 Under check

 New Delhi, March 28 (PTI): The government has asked employers to furnish complete details of perquisites apart from salaries paid to their employees in the annual salary certificate, also known as Form 16.

 In a notification dated March 26, the finance ministry has made it mandatory for all employers to submit information such as value of perquisites paid to their employees, profits in lieu of salary, entertainment allowance and tax paid on behalf of their employees.

 The employers will now have to provide details about deposit of taxes each month after deducting from the salary of employees, besides education cess and other charges in the TDS forms.

 The changes in the tax forms are expected to provide complete details to taxmen about the gross income of employees and improve the flow of income tax to the state exchequer.

 The amendments in these forms have been introduced after the government failed to amend the Form 2F due to stiff opposition from political quarters and tax experts. This has to be filled by the tax assessees along with Form 16.

 Form 16A, which is used to issue a certificate of deduction of tax on income earned from interest on securities, interest other than securities, lottery and crossword puzzle, has also been amended to facilitate electronic filing of returns, said a senior income tax official. 

 The official added that the ministry has substituted Form 16, 16A and 27D with immediate effect.

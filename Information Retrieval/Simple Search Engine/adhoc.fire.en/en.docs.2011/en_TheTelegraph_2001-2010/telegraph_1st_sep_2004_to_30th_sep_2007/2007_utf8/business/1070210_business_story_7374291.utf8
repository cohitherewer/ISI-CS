The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Cottons bets big on city 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Calcutta, Feb. 9: One more player has thrown the hat into the citys buzzing retail ring.

 Cottons by Century, the readymade apparel brand of Century Textiles, will roll out 15 stores in Calcutta in the next one year. Century is the flagship company of the Rs 3,000-crore BK Birla Group.

 Our focus now is clearly the east and Calcutta will naturally be the centre of our expansion plans in this region, where we will set up 70 to 80 outlets, Mahendra Padhy, head of marketing of the mid-to-premium brand, told The Telegraph on Friday.

 Both company-owned as well as franchisee outlets will be rolled out simultaneously. Cottons has signed up with Lake Mall, Riverside Mall in Howrah, Mani Square and Firangi Bazaar on the EM Bypass, and the hunt for other properties is on. 

 Calcutta is now one of the fastest growing markets and we hope it can energise the east to fetch around 20 per cent of our national targets, said Padhy. A combination of 140 multi-brand outlets and own stores will sell the brand in eastern India, he added.

 Its an extremely aggressive roadmap and is a clear pointer to the inherent buoyancy in the apparel retail market here, said Abhijit Das, regional director of Trammell Crow Meghraj, one of the property consultants facilitating the Cottons foray in the east.

 Century Textiles launched the Cottons brand in 2003 and now has over 100 stores with 200,000 sq ft-plus shop-floor space across India. By the end of the current financial year, it is aiming at 20 more outlets, adding another 50,000 sq ft of retail racks.

 While the product portfolio has a defined stress on formalwear, the brand is looking at a tilt towards casuals in the near future.

 For Calcutta and the east, we might bring in more of ethnic fashion for the youth, even as formal shirts would continue to be our core focus, said Vipul Shah, who heads the city marketing team.

 GE to buy Sondex

 London, Sept. 4 (Reuters): General Electric (GE) has agreed to buy British oilfield services firm Sondex for 288.7 million ($583.1 million) in an all-cash deal.

 GE, whose interests cover technology, media and financial services, will pay 460 pence a share for Sondex. The British firm designs, makes and markets electro-mechanical equipment for oilfield service companies.

 The offer price is 35.5 percent above Sondexs closing share price on August 30, the day before it announced takeover talks.

 FM wary of rise in rupee

 Washington, Sept. 26 (PTI): The rapid appreciation of the rupee against the dollar is a cause for concern and the central bank may have to intervene if there is a disorderly movement in the exchange rate, Union finance minister P. Chidambaram has said.

 Our exchange rate has a symbiotic relationship with the exchange rate of the US ... The rupee is stable against the euro and many other currencies. It is only against the dollar that the rupee has appreciated by nearly 10 per cent in the last eight to nine months, he said.

 The policy is to allow a two-way movement of the rate, but the only concern is that the movement should be orderly, he said at an interactive session at the Peterson Institute for International Economics here.

 Neither the government nor the central bank has a view on the exchange rate. This is market-determined and it will continue to be so; but if there is volatility or any disorderly movement, I suppose the central bank will intervene using whatever instrument it has. The central government does nothing on that behalf, the minister said.

 The rupees real and nominal effective exchange levels are way beyond comfort levels at the moment, but that is something we have to learn to live with, he said.

 Unless the US government does something about the dollar, there is nothing much I can do about the rupee as far as the rupee-dollar parity is concerned, Chidambaram said.

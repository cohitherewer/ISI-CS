 New Delhi, May 21: Real estate firm Emaar MGF and Autralias Leighton Asia (Southern) have floated a 50:50 joint venture company in the construction sector.

 The new entity Leighton Construction India (LCI) will invest $150 million to introduce the latest technology and global expertise in design, construction and safety. It is likely to execute projects worth $2.5 billion and create one lakh jobs over the next five years.

 The joint venture company will initially provide design and construction services to Emaar MGF projects across India.

 A memorandum of understanding was signed today by Shravan Gupta, executive vice-chairman and managing director, Emaar MGF Land, and David Savage, managing director of Leighton Asia Southern Ltd.

 This joint venture consolidates our future in India for the long term, and confirms our place as one of the leading construction contractors in the country, Savage said .

 Emaar MGF is a joint venture between Dubai-based Emaar Properties and Indian real estate developer MGF. It has projects lined up across the country in the residential, commercial, education and healthcare sectors.

 Leighton Asia Southern is the flagship company of Leighton Group with an annual revenue of over $8 billion. 

 In two years since it started operations from Mumbai, Leighton has secured orders worth around $600 million in infrastructure and building projects from Nokia, Flextronics, Motorola and Reliance, an official statement said. 

 Last week, Leighton said it saw good opportunities in India, particularly in toll roads, airports, oil and gas, building and contract mining.

 The company also said it expected a 55 per cent rise in profits in 2006-07, up from the previous forecast of 45 per cent. It posted a 62 per cent rise in profits for the first nine months of 2006-07.

 On Emaar MGFs plans to hit the capital market, Gupta said, We plan to come out with an initial public offering in next 12-18 months.

 He said the public issue would be big but did not disclose the amount the company aimed to raise. 

 He dismissed recent reports that the company wanted to raise up to $5 billion from the IPO, saying that was an exaggerated figure.

 We are a well-funded company and have a very low level of debt, he said, adding the company would be diluting 10 per cent of its holdings through the public issue. 

 The joint venture firm will construct Emaar MGFs 3,000-acre township in Mohali. Two more projects in Mohali and one in Gurgaon are in the pipeline.

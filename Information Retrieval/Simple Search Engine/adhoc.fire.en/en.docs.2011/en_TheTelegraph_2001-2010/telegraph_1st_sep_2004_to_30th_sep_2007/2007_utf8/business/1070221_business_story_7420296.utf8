The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Wal-Mart net rises to $3.9bn

 Back in form 

 Feb. 20 (Agencies): Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Tuesday

 posted higher quarterly profit after the world rsquo;s biggest retailer cut

 prices on hot items such as toys and electronics to lure

 customers during the holiday shopping season.

 Net income rose to $3.94 billion, or 95 cents per share,

 in the fourth quarter that ended on January 31, compared

 with $3.59 billion or 86 cents per share a year ago. The

 company rsquo;s

 net income had risen to $2.65 billion, or 63 cents per

 share, in the third quarter ended on October 31.

 Income from continuing operations rose to $3.94 billion

 or 95 cents per share in the fourth quarter from $3.62

 billion, or 87 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts

 on average had been expecting a profit of 90 cents per

 share, according to Reuters Estimates.

 In the recent months, US same-store sales gains have been

 paltry for Wal-Mart, as it contends with store remodelling

 projects and mixed results from its efforts to stock trendy

 merchandise, like skinny jeans. But it vowed aggressive

 price cuts during the holiday season to boost sales.

 Shares of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company have

 risen roughly 4 per cent in the past year, while rival

 Target Corp is up roughly 15 per cent. 

 Wal-Mart stock trades at 15.1 times next year rsquo;s earnings estimated

 earnings, compared with a multiple of 17 for Target. Wal-Mart

 had posted lacklustre sales growth at its US stores open at least a year,

 hurt by disruptions from store remodelling efforts and a poor reception

 for its trendier clothing.

 SPS Steel plans IPO

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 10: City-based SPS Steel and Power Ltd is planning to tap the capital market for its expansion projects. Group chairman Bipin Vohra said the company would come out with a Rs 100-crore odd initial public offering (IPO) in 2008. The company also plans to invest Rs 1,200 crore to set up a 250MW power plant.

 In order to finance the equity component of this project, an IPO has been planned. However, by then most of our steel project would go on stream, he said at a press meet today.

 SPS has acquired Pawan Sut Sponge Iron, a unit in Orissa, for Rs 30 crore. It has also bought the steel division of Suraj Fabrics Ltd in Himachal Pradesh for Rs 40 crore.

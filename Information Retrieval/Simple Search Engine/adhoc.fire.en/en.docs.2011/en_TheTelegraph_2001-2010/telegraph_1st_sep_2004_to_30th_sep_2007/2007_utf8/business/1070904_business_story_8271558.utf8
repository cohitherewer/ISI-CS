 Calcutta, Sept. 3: Companies from Thailand will participate in Government of Indias Rs 50,000-crore programme to develop infrastructure in the Northeast, according to Mani Shankar Aiyar, the minister for development of northeastern region (Doner).

 They will enter into joint ventures with their Indian counterparts at a Doner-convened meet in Bangkok in the first week of October.

 The National Highway Authority of India, the Border Roads Organisation, the Border Area Development Programme and Doner will invest Rs 50,000 crore in the next five years to improve infrastructure in the region.

 The Northeast does not have the capacity to absorb such a large capital. Many companies are not interested to invest there. Thailand has surplus resources to execute projects in other countries and we have been able to sensitise them about developing the region, Aiyar said at an event organised by the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce, Shellac and the Forest Products Export Promotion Council.

 Thailand shares similar natural resources with the Northeast. 

 We see business opportunity not only in developing roadways, but also in power, gas and railways, Aiyar said.

 The Thai support is even more important taking into consideration the fact that organisations such as the National Highway Authority of India and the public works department are over-stressed and suffer from inadequate managerial supervision.

 The Thai commerce ministry has opened an Indian hub a special wing on the occasion of this event.

 Doner, in association with the Indian Chamber of Commerce, will post an official at the Indian embassy in Bangkok two weeks before the event to help participating Indian companies.

 Ministerial meet

 Aiyar is preparing a vision document for the upcoming meeting of the all the chief ministers from the Northeast with key cabinet ministers.

 Bharti to double tower capacity 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: Bharti Airtel plans to have 80,000 towers by the end of this fiscal, which are twice that of the previous year. 

 Last year, we doubled the number of towers to 40,000. We are now planning to double it to 80,000 to increase our coverage, said Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman and managing director of Bharti Airtel. These towers will be set up everywhere, especially in the rural areas, Mittal added. 

 In April, Bharti had announced plans to spend $3.5 billion in 2007-08 to upgrade and expand its network to compete with Reliance Communications, Idea Cellular and Hutch Essar. 

 Reliance Telecom Infrastructure has over 14,000 towers and plans to add 23,000 more this fiscal.

 Cellular operators have approached the department of telecom (DoT) to raise the proposed number of towers to 25,000 from 10,000 in the next tender.

 The DoT has prepared a tender to set up about 8,000 towers in rural India with support from the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF). Telecom companies pay 5 per cent of their total revenues to the USOF, which is used for rural telephony. 

 Telecom companies are investing heavily in towers to cash in on the growing number of customers.

 Bharti also plans to join rival Reliance Communications in selling shares in the tower subsidiary to investors. 

 Telecom companies are selling stakes in their tower businesses to unlock value for shareholders. This is because a separate tower company gets a better valuation than a single entity. 

 Mittals Bharti owns a controlling stake in Bharti Airtel. Singapore Telecom holds a 31 per cent stake in the company.

 Bharti Airtel shares were up marginally at Rs 827.20 on the BSE today

 The companys consolidated revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 grew 53 per cent to Rs 5,905 crore. 

 The net profit for the quarter rose 100 per cent to Rs 1,512 crore.

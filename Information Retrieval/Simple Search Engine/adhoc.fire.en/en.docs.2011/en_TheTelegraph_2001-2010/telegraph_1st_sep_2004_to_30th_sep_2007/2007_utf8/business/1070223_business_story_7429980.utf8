 Semiconductor policy cleared

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: The government today cleared the semiconductor fabrication policy, which will provide tax sops to companies proposing to set up semiconductor (chip-making) and micro and nano technology-based manufacturing industries in India.

 IT minister Dayanidhi Maran said the country can expect over $10 billion of foreign investment. A typical fab requires a minimum $3 billion investment. Our country has the ecosystem to take two to three such fabs, he said.

 The Union cabinet announced a capital subsidy of up to 25 per cent to attract investments from global firms such as Intel to set up semiconductor manufacturing units.

 Semiconductor companies willing to avail of the subsidy, which will be 20 per cent of the capital expenditure during the first 10 years, have to invest a minimum Rs 2,500 crore. The units will have to be set up in special economic zones (SEZs).

 The threshold investment limit to manufacture storage devices, micro and nano technology products, set up assembly and testing units for these products and make organic light emitting diodes is Rs 1,000 crore.

 If the unit is located outside an SEZ, it will attract 25 per cent capital subsidy in the first 10 years and countervailing duty on capital goods would be exempted.

 These special incentives will facilitate the development of electronics and IT manufacturing. The incentives will be available to companies till March 2010.

 Lack of a policy had led Intel to turn its back on India and go to Israel to set up a fab.

 The policy has no direct impact on existing players. They will, however, benefit if they plan huge investments.

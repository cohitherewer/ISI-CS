 State Bank chases new businesses

 Mumbai, June 26 (PTI): The State Bank of India plans to enter seven new business streams, including pension funds, to tap emerging opportunities.

 The bank will float a subsidiary to manage pension funds under the new pension scheme for government employees, sbi chairman .P. Bhatt said at the 52nd annual general meeting of the bank.

 The bank has been shortlisted by pfrda as one of the four players, Bhatt said, adding pension funds were a huge business opportunity as only 11 per cent of the current workforce of 450 million were covered under retirement benefits. The bank also proposes to launch financial planning and advisory services for the affluent class. This will be upgraded to wealth management at a later stage, Bhatt said.

 The rise in investments in the securities market has led to a demand for a full range of custodial services. 

 A separate custodial services company will be floated soon, he said.

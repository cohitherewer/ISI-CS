 Calcutta, May 3: Phillips Carbon Black Ltd will invest Rs 475 crore to increase capacity and generate more power in three of its plants.

 The RPG Enterprises company is also scouting for opportunities abroad.

 Phillips Carbon was open to the idea of a greenfield venture or an acquisition overseas, chairman Sanjiv Goenka said.

 The company is the ninth largest producer of carbon black in the world, which is used by tyre and rubber companies. It is set to grab the sixth spot after the capacity hike by the third quarter of 2008-09.

 The board has approved the setting up of a plant at Mundra in Gujarat with an initial capacity of 75,000 tonnes and a 14-mw power plant. This will involve an investment of Rs 215 crore.

 Moreover, a capacity of 50,000 tonnes will be added at Kochi, taking the total to 85,000 tonnes. 

 A 12-mw power plant will also come up there with a combined investment of Rs 135 crore.

 The company is also setting up a 30-mw power plant at its Durgapur unit at an investment of Rs 120 crore.

 Goenka said the fresh investments at Kochi and Mundra involving Rs 360 crore would be funded by a debt-equity ratio of 1.5:1. 

 We have tied up Rs 210 crore of debt. Promoters will bring in Rs 45 crore equity by way of preferential warrants and another Rs 95 crore will come from internal accruals, he added.

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today asked the textiles industry to shun complacency and become globally competitive, while assuring steps to protect productive sectors from the effects of rupee appreciation.

 Sops and subsidies to limit the impact of rupee appreciation are short-term measures. However, in the long run, the industry must adjust itself to the new dynamics, Singh said today at the end of a textiles summit here.

 You will have to engage in ruthless cost cutting so that you are competitive, come what may, he said, adding that the textiles industry must learn from the automotive and pharmaceutical industries to become more productive and efficient. 

 Singh asked the business leaders to take on their rivals by scaling up their operations from being low-value suppliers to high-value suppliers. He also asked the industry to invest in operations, which had the scale and scope to generate efficiencies. The government proposes to set up a technology mission on technical textiles, meant for specialised sectors such as medicine and defence, to encourage growth of such products.

 He directed the ministries of finance, commerce and textiles to sit together and find out solutions for the problems of the industry.

 Speaking at the summit yesterday, commerce minister Kamal Nath had said unabated rise of the rupee against the dollar might come in the way of meeting the countrys export target of $160 billion in 2007-08.

 Last month, the government had announced a $320-million package for exporters to counter the rupee appreciation.

 Calcutta, Aug. 21: SBI Life Insurance Company plans to launch a simplified traditional endowment plan that can be sold over the counter. This year, the insurance company will also launch Dhanaraksha Plus, an umbrella group credit insurance plan that will cover all retail loans. The insurer now provides discrete group covers for personal, mortgage and car loans.

 Dhanraksha Plus will be a single credit insurance covering all retail loans personal, auto or housing, said Pier-Paolo Dipaola, deputy chief executive officer of SBI Life Insurance Company. After the introduction of the plan, the company will gradually withdraw from its existing offerings of reducing loan term cover. Under the new plan, a policyholder can get a maximum cover of Rs 30 lakh. The cover will be extended to the existing as well as new buyers of our credit insurance, he said.

 A credit insurance protects against repaying an outstanding loan in case of death or permanent disability of a borrower. The insurer pays the loan to the bank or the lending institution while the ownership of the property still remains with the legal heir(s) of the policyholder.

 While an individual can buy credit cover directly from an insurer, it is beneficial to get it as a group insurance product from a lending institution. This is because a credit insurance is a pure term assurance plan. There will be no survival benefit after the loan term and the premium rate for an individual policy is much higher than a group policy.

 A number of life insurers, including the LIC, HDFC Standard Life and Tata-AIG Life, are providing reducing loan term assurance since the last 5-6 years. However, this product has failed to catch the fancy of retail borrowers, particularly those opting for home loans. Such an insurance cover will increase the EMI of home loan borrowers marginally by Rs 100 to Rs 150.

 Banks and financial institutions did not promote credit insurance and the borrowers lacked the knowledge of such a product. According to a survey by the BNP Paribas Assurance division, only 8 per cent of the 1,037 people surveyed in six major cities in the country knew about this product.

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: You may soon have multiple flavours of branded coffee, cheesy pizzas and even Kentucky Fried Chicken served at your nearest rundown railway station.

 Opening doors to fast food mini-kiosks, the Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) has shortlisted about 11 agencies to set up quick service fast food kiosks at some of the major railway stations across the country.

 Designed to be set up on 500 sq ft on the platforms, the corporation has received applications from chains such as Cafe Coffee Day, Nestle India, Devyani International (franchisees for Costa Coffee), Kentucky Fried Chicken, Dominos Pizza, American chain Switz Food, McDonalds, Haldirams and Bikanerwala.

 The aim is to open 30-40 kiosks. Few of these will be operational in three to four months. We have shortlisted 11 players and talks are on with others as well, Vinod Asthana, executive director catering services of IRCTC, told The Telegraph. 

 According to the corporations guidelines, only those chains that have a minimum turnover of Rs 20 crore, operate more than 20 retail outlets, employ trained manpower, have a centralised kitchen and follow strict hygiene standards can qualify for setting up kiosks.

 The supply chain logistics has to be there in place. The kiosks will only sell pre-cooked and pre-packaged food items, said Asthana.

 To begin with, the kiosks will be set up at stations in Calcutta, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Trivandrum, Baroda, Jaipur and Bhopal.

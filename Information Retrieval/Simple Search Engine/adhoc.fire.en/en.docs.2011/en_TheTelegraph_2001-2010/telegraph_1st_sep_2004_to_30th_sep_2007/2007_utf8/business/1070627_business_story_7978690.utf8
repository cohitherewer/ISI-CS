 Calcutta, June 26: The National Housing Bank will pick up stakes in housing finance companies that mostly operate in rural areas.

 We are talking to two private non-finance companies for equity stakes in their proposed housing finance ventures. In one of these, we will make an investment of Rs 25 crore, NHB chairman and managing director S. Sridhar said.

 The bank has decided to pick up a minimum of 11 per cent and a maximum of 26 per cent stake in any such housing finance company and the maximum investment in a single joint venture will be Rs 25 crore. 

 However, the NHBs investment will be more like a private equity investment. We will exit from such a venture within seven years, preferably after five, Sridhar said.

 We want to make home loans easily available to people in rural areas where there will be a shortage of 47.43 million houses by 2012, Sridhar said. 

 At the national level, the aggregate shortage of houses during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan is estimated at 73.96 million. To meet this shortage, the housing sector will require an investment of Rs 120,000 crore on an average, he said. The investment figure was, however, based on a conservative estimate of Rs 1.2 lakh per house. 

 Given the current mix of housing loans provided by banks and housing finance companies, banks will have to increase their credit to the housing sector to Rs 400,000 crore by 2012 from around Rs 240,000 crore. 

 This will be quite difficult. We need to look for other sources of housing finance a new financial architecture. We now have reverse mortgage lending, Sridhar said. Using capital markets through securitised debts could be one option, he added. 

 We have earmarked a disbursement of Rs 75,000 crore to reduce the housing shortage by 30 per cent over the next three years. 

 The NHB will provide refinance to regional rural banks for funding housing development in rural areas. It will introduce a scheme to supplement the existing Indira Awas Yojana under which a beneficiary gets a maximum loan of Rs 20,000. It will also launch a composite loan scheme in partnership with banks, microfinance institutes and self-help groups for construction/repair of houses for business purposes, he said.

 Credit guarantee

 The bank is also in talks with the International Finance Corporation, Asian Development Bank and a foreign private company to set up a mortgage credit guarantee institution. 

 The Rs 3,000-crore company, conceived a few years ago, would help banks and housing finance companies extend loans by providing a guarantee for the credit. When Basel II norms are implemented, banks will be required to set aside less capital for housing loans backed by guarantees from the mortgage credit guarantee company, he said. 

 Property index

 The NHB has been working on the residential property price index for two years now and it is almost ready. 

 Sridhar said, The Residex is almost finalised and we will announce it within the next two to three weeks. 

 To construct this index, the bank has taken into account residential property prices in five major cities Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore and Calcutta. 

 The NHB will open an office in Calcutta in the next couple of months, he added.

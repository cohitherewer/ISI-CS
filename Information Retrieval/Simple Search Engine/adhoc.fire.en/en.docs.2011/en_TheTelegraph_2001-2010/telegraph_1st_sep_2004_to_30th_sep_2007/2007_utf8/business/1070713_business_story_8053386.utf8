 Rio Tinto, Alcan in buy deal

 A NEW OWNER

 Sydney/London, July 12 (Reuters): Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto has agreed to buy Canadas Alcan Inc for $38.1 billion to create the worlds biggest aluminum producer, the two firms said on Thursday.

 Rio, the worlds second-biggest miner, said it would pay $101 a share in cash, 13 per cent above Alcans closing price in New York on Wednesday and 33 per cent above a rival $28.8-billion cash-and-share bid from US group Alcoa.

 Rio said the deal was unanimously recommended by Alcans board. The takeover would help it diversify and boost its position in the aluminum market. The two firms said they had also agreed on a break-up fee of around $1.05 billion.

 The mining industry is benefitting from soaring metal prices and established players are seeking deals to ward off competition from emerging markets.

 Analysts were divided on whether there would be a counter-bid, but agreed the tie-up was likely to spark more deals.

 A source said BHP Billiton, the worlds biggest miner, and Brazils Companhia Vale do Rio Doce had also placed their proposals and were prepared to make all-cash offers, but Rios was the best deal Alcan was able to broker.

 Numis Securities analyst John Meyer said Alcoa and Swiss-based Xstrata were possible counter-bidders, but thought BHP might turn its attention to Alcoa.

 Its a big improvement on the Alcoa offer, said Charles Stanley analyst Tom Gidley-Kitchin. It puts Alcoas strategy in question (and) makes them vulnerable to a BHP Billiton offer.

 Rio shares in London were down 1.8 per cent at 3,922 pence. Kepler Teather amp; Greenwood analysts said the deal made it less likely that Rio could be a takeover candidate. Shares in smaller London-listed miners Vedanta, Lonmin and Antofagasta rose sharply on hopes they might be the next targets in the sector.

 There is a lot of cash being generated in the mining sector, so youll continue to see M amp;As across the board, said Greg Goodsell, equity strategist at ABN Amro.

 Rio chief executive Tom Albanese said the firm saw a bright future for aluminum. The demand outlook (for aluminum) for the next 10 years is positive, with an expected world demand growth of over 6 per cent by 2011, he said.

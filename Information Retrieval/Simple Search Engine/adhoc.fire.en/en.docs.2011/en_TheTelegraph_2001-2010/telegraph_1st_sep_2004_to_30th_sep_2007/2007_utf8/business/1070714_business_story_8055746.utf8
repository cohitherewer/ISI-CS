 UTI Bank net rises 45%

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 13: UTI Bank has reported a 45.15 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 174.98 crore in the first quarter of this fiscal over the corresponding period in 2006-07. The growth in profit came on the back of an improvement in the banks operations, particularly in fee-based and trading income, during the quarter.

 The private sector bank has clocked a 344 per cent jump in income from trading operations (primarily securities transaction) at Rs 70.79 crore against Rs 15.93 crore in the year-ago period. Fee-based income went up 39 per cent to Rs 271.53 crore.

 Other income grew 71 per cent to Rs 342.32 crore, while its net interest income, which reflects the profits from the mobilisation of loans and deposits, increased 39 per cent to Rs 446.83 crore.

 Income from non-core businesses represents 43.38 per cent of UTI Banks operating income during the quarter.

 The bank had to increase provisioning for employees retirement benefit and other payments as required under Accounting Standard 15. All domestic companies will have to follow this standard from the current financial year. The provisioning for employees benefits went up 85.6 per cent to Rs 147.90 crore in the April-June quarter this year compared with Rs 79.69 crore in the same period last year.

 Rural banks in east cut sorry figure

Mumbai, June 5: Regional rural banks in the east are mired in losses and their only hope is capital infusion from the Centre, the state and their sponsor banks.

 The net worth of two of the three RRBs in Bengal the Bangia Gramin Bikash Bank and Paschim Banga Gramin Bank have turned negative, sources said. The rural banks are sponsored by United Bank of India and Uco Bank, respectively. 

 Two RRBs in Orissa and Assam also face the same problem.

 The combined losses of the RRBs in Bengal are estimated to be around Rs 700 crore and their negative net worth around Rs 450 crore.

 If rural banks in Assam, Manipur and Tripura are considered, the combined losses of banks sponsored by the United Bank of India is a little over Rs 4,000 crore and their negative net worth is around Rs 1,570 crore. The accumulated loss of those sponsored by Uco Bank is over Rs 4,300 crore, sources said.

 However, the Centre, state governments and sponsor banks are likely to provide capital to the RRBs as the Reserve Bank wants rural banks to attain a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 7 per cent by March 31, 2009. 

 The finance minister had said the government would support the loss-making RRBs, sources said.

 S.K. Bhattacharjee, general secretary, All India RRB Officers Federation, said the first step to revitalise the banks is to provide capital support to wipe out negative net worth. They will then be eligible to be classified as scheduled banks by the RBI.

 To comply with the capital adequacy norms as contemplated by the apex bank, the RRBs will need further capital support. 

 These measures are essential to continue the functioning of RRBs, he said.

 Sponsor banks hold 35 per cent in the RRBs, the Centre holds 50 per cent, while the state holds 35 per cent. 

 Earlier, the RBI allowed the RRBs to diversify into other activities. They were allowed to undertake insurance business as corporate agents without risk participation if they met certain conditions. 

 The RBI stipulated nine conditions for the RRBs to be eligible to undertake insurance business. These include a positive net worth.

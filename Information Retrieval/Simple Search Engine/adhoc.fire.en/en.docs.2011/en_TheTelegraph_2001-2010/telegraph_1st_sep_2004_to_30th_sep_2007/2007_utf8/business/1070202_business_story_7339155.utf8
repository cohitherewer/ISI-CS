 New Delhi, Feb. 1: The countrys software services and business process outsourcing (BPO) companies can realise $60 billion in export revenues by 2010 if they reduce operational costs and improve profitability, the National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) has said.

 India is now the leading destination, having captured 65 per cent and 46 per cent of the global offshore IT and BPO markets respectively.

 As the market leader, it is imperative that we continue to set standards for the global industry. IT and BPO centres in India must now provide additional benefits such as speed, flexible operating models, innovation and productivity enhancements, which can be achieved by excelling in operations, Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said.

 By reaching the next frontier in operational excellence, India can maintain leadership in a $300-billion potential market for offshore services, added Karnik.

 Nasscom chairman B. Ramalinga Raju, who is also the founder and chairman of Satyam Computer Services, said, While customers are highly satisfied with remote centres, and as a result are ramping up operations in India, it is clear that their expectations are rising.

 Noshir Kaka, partner, McKinsey amp; Company, said, Focusing on operational excellence is critical for the industry to maintain market leadership. Our study suggests that in BPO, companies with effective practices enjoy at least 20-30 per cent lower operating costs vis--vis their peers. In IT services, we have seen that this could translate into a 3-6 per cent EBIT improvement for average providers.

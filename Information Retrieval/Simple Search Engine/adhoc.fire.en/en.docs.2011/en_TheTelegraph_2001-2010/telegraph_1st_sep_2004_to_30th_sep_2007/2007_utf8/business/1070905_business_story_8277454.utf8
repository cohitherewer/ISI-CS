 Zurich/Lausanne, Sept. 4 (Reuters): Nestle has agreed to take over Swiss water bottler Henniez. It will first buy a 62 per cent stake and then launch a public tender.

 Nestle will buy the 62 per cent stake for 3,000 Swiss francs per share from the Rouge family. 

 The transaction is valued at 155 million Swiss francs ($128.3 million), the company said in a statement.

 Henniez has a total market value of 213 million francs.

 Nestle will launch a public tender offer for the remaining shares of Henniez at 5,303 francs per share, which is below the companys closing price of 5,340 francs on Monday.

 Expansion mode

 Nestle, the worlds largest food group, is looking at acquisitions in China and other countries as it aims at a rapid growth, Carlo Donati, chief executive officer of Nestle Waters, said today.

 Our strategy of mergers and acquisitions in the future will be to integrate our local activities in certain markets or expand our geographic presence as, for instance, is the case in China, where we have a small base and are looking out for acquisitions, Donati said. 

 The company, however, was not aiming at major acquisitions in the water segment. 

 A rainy weather this summer had a negative impact on growth, Donati said.

 In Europe and North America, weather conditions in July and August were not favourable for beverage companies and therefore it will have an impact on the second half for Nestle Waters, Donati said. 

 If it rains, you normally dont serve water, he added.

 Big boys prefer solo run in pension funds

 JAYATI GHOSE AND GARIMA SINGH 

New Delhi, May 15: The State Bank of India and the Life Insurance Corporation are unlikely to join hands with foreign entities to manage the governments new pension scheme. However, smaller players such as PNB Mutual Fund may tie up with foreign companies.

 The SBI, a front-runner in the race to be a pension fund manager, is not keen on such an arrangement because the countrys largest commercial bank feels that the corpus of Rs 2,000 crore is not sufficient enough to merit a tie-up with a foreign player. 

 Sources said SBI Mutual Fund manages assets worth Rs 16,500 crore.

 A senior SBI official said the size of some of the funds schemes was larger than the pension corpus.

 The official said the commission of 1.5 per cent of the assets under management offered little scope for income sharing with a foreign company. The fund manager will be squeezed on fees in the first place. 

 The LIC is also inclined to toe the State Bank line. LIC will definitely bid for the pension scheme fund and we have the strength to manage the fund on our own, H. Sadhak, the chief executive of LICs new pension fund, said. 

 The LICs total assets under management is over Rs 6,00,000 crore.

 The Pension Funds Regulatory Development Authority has invited bids to manage the governments new pension scheme.

 Interested parties include SBI Mutual Fund, the LIC, Punjab National Bank and the IDBI. 

 Analysts said foreign tie-ups were unlikely at such an early stage of pension reforms. If such pacts take place now, it will mean an overseas entity gaining a toehold in the pension segment by paying a low entry premium. 

 They said local entities should first scale up their businesses, which would give them better bargaining power to demand a higher premium for their stakes.

 Value could be encashed by those who are patient and willing to play the waiting game, instead of scouting for a foreign partner now and parting with equity, the analysts said.

 Punjab National Bank is interested in tying up with the US-based Principal Financial Group (PFG) to manage pension funds. 

 PFG has the requisite expertise and knowledge to handle such pension funds, U.S. Bhargava, banking expert and former chief general manager of the PNB, said.

 Bhargava said the PNB would decide on the terms and conditions of the new venture by next week.

 Foreign asset management companies such as the PFG are optimistic on pension funds in India.

 Even though the initial corpus is low, once volumes grow fund managers can look forward to a better deal, Bhargava said.

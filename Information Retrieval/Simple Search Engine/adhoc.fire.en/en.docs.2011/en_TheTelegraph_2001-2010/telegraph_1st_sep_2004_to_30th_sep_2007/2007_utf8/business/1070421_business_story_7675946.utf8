 Eveready in pact with Phoenix

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 20: Eveready Industries India Ltd (EIIL) has entered into an agreement with Phoenix Lamps to sell the latters general lighting lamp (GLL), Halonix. This will add Rs 100 crore to the companys turnover.

 This is part of our expansion strategy in which we plan to use our distribution network as our asset. Phoenix Lamps is worth Rs 300 crore, while Halonix comprises about Rs 50 crore of its turnover, said Deepak Khaitan, executive vice-chairman and managing director of EIIL. 

 The market for such lighting products, which includes compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), is growing at 70 to 80 per cent. We hope to at least double the brands turnover by the year-end, he added.

 Eveready has launched mosquito coils and will soon introduce vapourisers as well. This is part of the companys plan to have a diversified portfolio.

 Phoenix manufactures lighting sources for general and automotive applications. 

 Actis Advisers, a private equity fund, has recently acquired a major stake and management control in Phoenix.

 An export cell has been created in EIIL, which will concentrate on selling its products.

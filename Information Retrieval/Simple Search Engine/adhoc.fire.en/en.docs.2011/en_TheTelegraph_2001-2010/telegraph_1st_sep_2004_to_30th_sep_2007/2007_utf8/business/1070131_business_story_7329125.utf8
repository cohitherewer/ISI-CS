 Sick PSU revival on fast track

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Jan. 30: The heavy industries ministry has started discussions with other ministries over the induction of private sector companies as strategic partners to revive chronically sick public sector companies such as Tyre Corporation and Richardson Cruddas.

 A senior official told The Telegraph that consultations were on with the finance and law ministries, and a cabinet note would be prepared to allow private firms take over management control of these sick units. 

 Cabinet approval needs to be followed by permission from Parliament. This is mandatory as these PSUs have been formed under an act of Parliament. 

 The heavy industries ministry is also keen on joint ventures between strong PSUs and the sick companies.

 However, an absence of synergy has made the strong PSUs unwilling to strike alliances with some of the sick companies. Such chronically sick companies can be better revived through a strategic partnership with private firms, the official said. 

 For instance, the government had asked Bharat Heavy Electricals, ONGC and Engineers India Ltd to revive Bharat Pumps and Compressors Ltd. 

 The government finally decided on Bhel for Bharat Pumps. The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will chip in with equity support. Engineers India (EIL) will provide technical expertise. This marks a consortium approach by the government to revive the sick companies. 

 The government expects to face more hurdles if alliances are planned with private companies than with the PSUs.

 In case of the private sector, the government needs to tread with caution lest they be at the receiving end of the Left for ushering privatisation through the back door.

 In the meantime, the official said leading tyre manufacturers were interested to buy the ailing Tyre Corporation of India, which is a favoured candidate for privatisation.

 Most tyre companies, which engage Tyre Corporation in jobbing work, are interested in the company.

 The Pawan Ruia group has already gone public with its interest in the company, while others are expected to follow suit. 

 This is good for the government as the competition will enable the government to get a better deal for the ailing tyre firm. 

 The tyre companies that outsource from the Tyre Corporation include MRF, Apollo Tyres, JK Tyres, Ceat and Birla Tyres.

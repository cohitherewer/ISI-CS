 Jet issue to raise Rs 1645cr

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 19: Jet Airways will raise close to Rs 1,645 crore through a rights issue that opens on June 26.

 Sources said the company needed the money to clear its dues arising from the Air Sahara acquisition and start long-haul operations to the US.

 In April, the company acquired Air Sahara for about Rs 1,450 crore. Of the total amount, Jet paid Rs 500 crore last year and another Rs 400 crore on April 20. It will pay the remaining Rs 550 crore in four annual interest-free instalments starting March 31, 2008.

 Sources said the company would partly use the funds raised from the rights issue to pay the remaining amount to Air Sahara.

 The company also needs capital to acquire wide-body aircraft, including 10 A330 Airbuses and 10 B777 Boeings, which will be used as long-haul carriers.

 Jet may use about 25-30 per cent of this capital for aircraft acquisitions. Once the Gulf route is opened up for private airlines, Jet will be the largest player from India for at least two years, said Pradeep Panicker of BNP Paribas.

 The private carriers in India are actively scouting opportunities in the Gulf, which is believed to be a huge cash ground because of the rise in tourism and business activities.

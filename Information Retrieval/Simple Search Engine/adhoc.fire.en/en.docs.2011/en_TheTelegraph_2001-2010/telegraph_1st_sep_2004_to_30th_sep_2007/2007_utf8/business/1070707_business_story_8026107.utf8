 Mumbai, July 6: Budweiser, the American classic lager beer, was today launched in India. It will initially be available in the south and the west. The beer will be available in the city from next year.

 Budweiser is made by the US-based Anheuser-Busch, which entered into a joint venture with Crown International in February. Crown Beers India, the 50:50 joint venture, will brew, market and distribute Budweiser and Armstrong in India. Both these brands will be available in four southern and western states that account for more than 50 per cent of beer sales in the country.

 In Maharashtra, Budweiser will be available in 650ml and 330ml bottles priced at Rs 68 and Rs 38 respectively. Imported Budweiser is sold in hotels, retail outlets and bars in Andhra Pradesh and Mumbai. Crown Beers plans to expand the brands reach in the southern and western states.

 In May, the joint venture introduced Armstrong, a premium strong beer. Officials from the Crown group said Armstrong sales exceeded expectations since its launch in Andhra Pradesh. To meet retail demand, the amount of Armstrong being brewed and packaged has been increased.

 Stephen J. Burrows, CEO and president of Anheuser-Busch Asia Pacific operations, said though the beer market in India was small, it had a huge potential. He said apart from a strong economy, the emerging middle-class held out good prospects for the industry in India.

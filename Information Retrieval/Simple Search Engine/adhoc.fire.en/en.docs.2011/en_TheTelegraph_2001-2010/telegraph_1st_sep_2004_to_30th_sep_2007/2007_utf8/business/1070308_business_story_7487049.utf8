 Hint of rethink on wine duty

 New Delhi, March 7: India today said it would be in a position to oblige EU on customs duty cuts in wine and spirits after it makes appropriate changes in its legislations.

 India wants to avoid the matter going to the WTOs dispute settlement body. I hope a solution can be found as the matter is being discussed at the highest level, commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath said after a meeting with EU agriculture commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel here.

 India is in a tight spot after the US said it would follow EU and take up Indias high duty on wines and spirits at the WTO. The European Union (EU) had earlier threatened to press for a dispute settlement panel at the WTO.

 At the meeting with Fischer Boel, Nath failed to impress upon the agriculture commissioner on the need to treat Indian whiskey on a par with European whiskey.

 Fischer Boel said the two were different as Indian whisky was made from molasses while European whisky was made from grain.

 Both the US and EU are miffed at India for its duty on wine and spirits which is as high as 550 per cent whereas the peak rates under WTO is 150 per cent. Admitting of a case against India, Nath said the government was exploring options to cut the duty. 

 Indias base import duties on wine and spirits are at 100 per cent and 150 per cent respectively, which are within WTO rules, but additional customs duty and state-level taxes push up the tariffs to over 500 per cent.

 A senior commerce ministry official said India is planning to scrap the additional customs duty and introduce legislation for equal tax treatment at state level to domestic and imported wine and spirits.

 The government will also make it mandatory for the states to charge equivalent rates of excise duty on imported and domestic wine and spirits, the official said.

 At their meeting Nath and Fischer Boel also discussed issues relating to the Doha round of WTO talks.

 Nath said Fischer Boel understood Indias concerns on opening up the agriculture markets. He said India would not pick up cudgels with the EU on the subsidy the EU offers to its farmers.

 Nath said India was waiting for the EU and US to agree on cuts in agriculture subsidies and tariffs for the Doha round of global trade talks to move forward.

 The developing countries will do two-thirds of what the developed countries agree to do, Nath added.

 Boel said India and EU were on the same side in agriculture though they differed over details. We see convergence in our positions.

 She said there was a window of opportunity for the Doha round and we hope to see light at the end of the tunnel. Nath also expressed his disappointment over delay in starting negotiations for India-EU trade and investment agreement. 

 US files case

 The Bush administration has filed a case against India over tariffs India imposes on American wine and distilled spirits.

 The case, filed with the World Trade Organisation, says that India is imposing tariffs ranging as high as 550 per cent in violation of its WTO commitments that these tariffs will not exceed 150 per cent. 

 With its fast-growing middle class, India could be an important export market for American wines and distilled spirits if not for these layers of duties, US trade representative Susan Schwab said while announcing the filing of the case.

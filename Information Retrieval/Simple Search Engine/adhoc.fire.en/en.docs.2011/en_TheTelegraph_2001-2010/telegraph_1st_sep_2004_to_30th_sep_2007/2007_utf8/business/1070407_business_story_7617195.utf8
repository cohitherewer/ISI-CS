 Nasdaq gives it to China

 New Delhi, April 6 (PTI): India has lost out to China in the arena of one of the worlds most respected stock exchange, Nasdaq, which has decided to launch a dedicated index of Chinese companies listed in the US.

 The development comes amid the growing global appetite of India Inc to expand its overseas footprint with a number of cross-border acquisitions, joint ventures and setting up of foreign business units.

 However, the number of Indian companies listed on the US stock exchanges has remained somewhat stagnant over the past few months, despite over 100 firms estimated to be mulling a listing either on the Nasdaq or NYSE. 

 Nasdaq stock markets planned China index would initially comprise 30 Chinese companies listed on any US exchange.

 The major impediment for India missing out to China for a dedicated country index is the lesser number of companies listed in the US as an index needs at least 30 companies, the market observers said.

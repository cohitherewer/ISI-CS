 Core sector growth flat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 11: Core industries have registered a flat growth of 7.4 per cent in April compared with the same period a year ago as coal production stagnated and the cement industry slowed down. 

 The coal industry registered a 0.5 per cent growth, worse than last years performance for the month when it logged a 3.4 per cent growth.

 Cement production, which has also been a cause of concern for the government, witnessed a slowdown to 5.1 per cent from 12.2 per cent for the same month last year.

 Finished steel production grew at a rate of 8.4 per cent in April 2007 against 10.1 per cent in the corresponding month of the previous year.

 However, neutralising the decline in growth of coal, cement and finished steel was the satisfactory growth registered by sectors such as petroleum refinery and electricity.

 While petroleum refinery production grew 15.1 per cent in April 2007 from 13.1 per cent in the same month in 2006, electricity generation grew 8.7 per cent compared with a 5.9 per cent growth in April 2006.

 Crude production grew 1.4 per cent during the month, recovering from the negative 1.8 per cent growth it registered in April 2006.

 During April-March 2006-07, the six core industries registered a growth of 8.6 per cent against 6.2 per cent during the corresponding period of the previous year.

 During 2006-07, crude petroleum production registered a growth of 5.5 per cent, recovering from the negative 5.2 per cent growth the sector saw in 2005-06.

 Production of petroleum refinery grew 12.3 per cent during 2006-07 compared with 2.1 per cent in the previous fiscal.

 Electricity generation too grew by 7.3 per cent, up from 5.1 per cent in 2005-06.

 Growth in production of coal slowed down to 6 per cent in the year from 6.6 per cent in the previous year.

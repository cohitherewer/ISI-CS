 Q amp;A

 Card trouble

 I am 66 years old. I took an SBI-UBI credit card in 2005 and surrendered the same in that year after clearing all the dues. In 2006, the bank sent me a new card bearing the old number even though I did not apply for a new card. I promptly surrendered the same and informed them. But the bank continues to send me bills regularly. What should I do?

 Sunit Kumar Ghatak, Nimta

 You write a fresh application to your bank. Keep a copy of the letter along with its receipt of acknowledgement by the bank and wait for one month. If your grievance is not redressed within that time, take up the matter with the banking ombudsman at the regional office of the RBI.

 Senior citizen scheme

 I am 73 years old. Last year I invested Rs 60,000 in Senior Citizen Savings Schemes bearing a 9 per cent rate of interest. Shall I be eligible to deduct any part of this investment from my total annual income for computing my taxable income? 

 Samir Banerjee, Calcutta

 No, you cannot get any tax benefit from investment in Senior Citizen Savings Scheme. It is not a specified investment instrument under section 80C.

 Mutual fund investment

 I am a businessman and my son is salaried. Both of us are income tax assessees. I want to buy some mutual funds and shares in the name of my son. We have no demat account. How can I buy?

 Firoza Khatoon, Calcutta

 You dont require a demat account to buy mutual funds. It is required for transactions in shares only. However, you may require a PAN for mutual fund transactions.

 Tax returns

 I am 72 years old and I have a house of my own, a telephone connection in my name and a car. I dont get any pension. My annual income was less than Rs 1,85,000 in financial year 2006-07. Do I have to submit income tax returns?

 Prabhas Chandra Rakshit, Salt Lake

 No, you wont be required to file income tax returns. The one-by-six criterion for submitting income tax returns has been abolished.

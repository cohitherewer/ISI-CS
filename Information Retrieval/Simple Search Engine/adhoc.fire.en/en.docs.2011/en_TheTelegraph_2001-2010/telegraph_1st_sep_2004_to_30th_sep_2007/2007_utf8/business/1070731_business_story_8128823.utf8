 Loud hint of rate stability

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 30: The Reserve Bank today said fiscal and monetary measures aided in containing inflation, hinting that there might not be any hike in key rates in the review of credit policy tomorrow.

 Pre-emptive monetary measures since mid-2004 accompanied by fiscal and supply-side measures have helped in containing inflation, the central bank said in the macroeconomic and monetary development document released here today.

 The resolve in the future would be to condition policy and perceptions for inflation in the range of 4-4.5 per cent, it said.

 Bankers too expect the central bank to leave key rates untouched.

 The Reserve Bank pointed out that growth in bank credit had moderated during the first quarter after the strong pace recorded in the preceding three years.

 The document touches upon both positives and some concerns that the central bank harbours. 

 Though the economy continues to post a robust growth, which includes a strong performance from the industrial and service sectors, RBI said its latest industrial outlook survey showed a drop. 

 According to observers, this is another indication that interest rates will not be raised and that the RBI is hinting that the economy is not over-heating.

 According to the Reserve Banks Industrial Outlook Survey conducted in June, business expectations index based on the assessment for April-June 2007 declined by 5.8 per cent over the previous quarter. The business expectations index, based on expectations for July-September, declined by 3 per cent over the previous quarter. 

 The document also contains some factors that worries the RBI. 

 The central bank warned that one of the key downside risks to the global economy is the possibility of a sharp slowdown in the US housing market and conditions in the sub-prime mortgage market there that could lead to greater volatility in capital flows to emerging economies.

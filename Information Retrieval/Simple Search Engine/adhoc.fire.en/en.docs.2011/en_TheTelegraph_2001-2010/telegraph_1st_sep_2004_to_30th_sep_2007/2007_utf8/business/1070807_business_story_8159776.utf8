 Bangalore, Aug. 6 (PTI): Tata Consultancy Services today said it was eyeing up to 150 deals between $5 million and $200 million in financial solutions over the next 12-18 months.

 Anywhere between 100-150 deals are likely to be in the pipeline in the next 12-18 months in the Asia Pacific, West Asia and Latin America, said N.G. Subramaniam, president of TCS Financial Solutions, a business unit of TCS. The number of deals in Europe and US could be smaller but of higher value.

 He said these deals in capital markets, insurance and retail financial services can be targeted by TCS Financial Solutions product portfolio under the brand TCS BaNCS.

 Subramaniam said 20 per cent of the deals are expected to be in the range of $30-200 million. The remaining 80 per cent could be in the $5-10 million bracket.

 TCS Financial Solutions has clocked a year-on-year growth of 60 per cent in revenues at $170 million in 2006-07. S. Ramadorai, CEO and managing director of TCS, said the banking, financial services and insurance segments contributed more than 40 per cent to the companys total revenues.

 TCS Financial Solutions has 2,720 professionals and plans to add another 500 globally by March-end. 

 Subramaniam said TCS was bullish on its financial solutions business, which gives it better rates and licence fee, resulting in higher margins for the company. The firm also announced the appointment of Robert U. Mullen as its head of global sales and Dennis Roman as its chief marketing officer. 

 Rupee rise 

 TCS has adopted a multi-pronged approach to deal with the impact of an appreciating rupee on its profitability, Ramadorai said. According to him, the company can demand certain price through value creation, especially from new customers.

 Hedging done by TCS is to the extent of $2.5 billion. The company is also focusing on improving productivity. The whole idea is to expand across multiple geographies of which India is a critical part, he said.

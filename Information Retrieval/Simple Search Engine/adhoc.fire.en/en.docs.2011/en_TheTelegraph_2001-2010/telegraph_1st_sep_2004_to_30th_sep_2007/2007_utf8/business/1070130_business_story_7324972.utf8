 Canon eyes 8% profit rise

 Tanaka: In high spirits

 Tokyo, Jan. 29 (Reuters): Canon Inc said on Monday it expects profit to rise 8.2 pe cent this year on robust sales of digital cameras and colour copiers. However, the forecast was below the market consensus and growth is expected to slow down from 2006.

 Tokyo-based Canon is enjoying hefty returns from its market share in digital cameras and colour office machines, and like other exporters, such as Toyota Motor Corp and Nintendo Co Ltd, its overseas earnings were boosted by a weaker yen last year. 

 Profit margins at Canon also outperformed rivals, Xerox and Nikon, as it introduced more factory automation to squeeze costs while expanding its higher-end line-up such as copiers that use more ink and paper. 

 For calendar 2007, Canon expects operating profit to rise to 765 billion yen ($6.3 billion), which would mark an eighth consecutive year of earnings growth. The market expects Canon to post 771.7 billion yen in operating profit this year based on forecasts from 20 analysts polled by Reuters.

 Earnings growth is also expected to slow this year compared with the 21.3 per cent profit jump in 2006. 

 Annual sales are expected to rise 7.1 per cent to 4.45 trillion yen this year, against a 10.7 per cent jump in 2006. 

 Operating profit in the year ended December 31 totalled 707 billion yen, including 78 billion yen due to the lower yen. 

 The biggest reason why we expect single-digit growth this year is because of the lack of currency impact, Toshizo Tanaka, a Canon executive in charge of finances, told a news conference on Monday. But the good business environment wont change, he added. Canon earns more than 75 per cent of its sales outside Japan. 

 The weak yen also boosted earnings at smaller printer rival Seiko Epson Corp, which reported better profits than expected on Friday.

 Strike it right

 Fixed maturity plans of mutual funds may be the answer to your investment woes, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 When stock markets turn choppy, bond markets provide a safe haven for investors. 

 However, right now interest rates are volatile too, thanks to the surging inflation. The rising interest rates have made bond investment tricky by increasing bond yields and depressing bond prices interest rate and bond prices move in opposite directions.

 Let us illustrate this position. A bond bearing an interest rate of 6 per cent would have had a face value (issue price) of Rs 100 when it was issued two years ago. Now, with the interest rate rising to 9 per cent, the price of the bond will come down to Rs 66.67 because you can now earn an interest of Rs 6 on an investment of Rs 66.67, which was Rs 100 a couple of years back. 

 Again, simply investing in any bond fund may not reduce the interest rate risk of your investments. 

 While bank fixed deposits that offer a 9-9.5 per cent assured interest income could be a good alternative, there are better bond investment options for those who are wary of wild swings in stock investments. 

 Better option

 Fixed maturity plans that most mutual fund houses offer under their umbrella of bond funds fit into this category of investments. 

What one needs to make sure while investing in bond/debt funds is that investments are not withdrawn till the maturity of the underlying bonds/debt papers. By synchronising investments with the maturity of the underlying bonds, one can eliminate the interest rate risk associated with bond investments to a great extent.

 However, small investors have paid little attention to fixed maturity plans, which not only give a higher return than bank fixed deposits having the same maturity, they are also more tax-efficient. 

 Traditional bond funds run a high interest rate risk by investing in bond of varying maturity. But fixed maturity plans reduce this interest rate risk to a great degree by investing in those bonds, government securities and other debt instruments that have the same maturity as that of the term of the plan. For example, a one-year FMP will invest in those government securities, treasury bills, commercial papers and bonds that have one year left for maturity and thus the face value of investments is almost assured. 

 Dynamic funds

 Since FMPs are dynamically managed, investors dont have to worry about losing the benefit of interest rate rise every month as is the case with bank fixed deposits. 

 Those who had invested in a one-year bank fixed deposit in February would have got an annual interest rate of 8.25 per cent. But now banks, such as IDBI and Punjab National Bank, are giving 9.5 per cent on a one-year fixed deposit. 

 Mutual funds are also offering capital protection-oriented schemes that are structurally similar to fixed maturity plans. But the main distinction between these two categories of funds lies in the fact that while FMPs target a given return, the primary aim of capital protection-oriented funds is to provide investors with at least the amount invested on maturity.

 However, it should be clearly borne in mind that while interest income from bank fixed deposits are assured, the return from fixed maturity plans are market-linked. But in a fixed maturity plan, you have both the growth and dividend options. 

 While FMPs primarily invest in bond and debt instruments of same maturity as the plans themselves, they also invest a small portion (15 to 20 per cent) in equities for faster appreciation of investment capital. 

 Tax savings

 What makes investments in FMPs more attractive than bank fixed deposits is the tax implications? 

 Unlike in interest income from bank fixed deposits, investors can avail of double indexation benefits on capital gains from FMPs the return from fixed maturity plans are considered as capital gains and not interest income. 

 Let us illustrate it here. Rahul invested Rs 1 lakh in a fixed maturity plan and Raja invested the same amount in a bank fixed deposit. Let us also assume that both Rahul and Raja pay income tax at the highest rate of 30 per cent and their investments provide the same return of 10.40 per cent (the interest rate on fixed deposit is assumed at 8.5 per cent to arrive at the 10.40 per cent return on investment).

 On the interest income at the maturity of his bank fixed deposit, Raja will have to pay an income tax at the rate of 33.66 per cent. 

 Factor in inflation

 But Rahul can adjust his gains from the sale of FMP units against the cost inflation index at the time of investment made. 

 If he takes the cost indexation benefit, he will have to pay capital gains tax at the rate of 20 per cent. But without indexation benefit, Rahul will have to pay a capital gains tax at the rate of 10 per cent only. 

 Whatever the case is, the post-tax return is higher than that from bank fixed deposits.

 Cost indexation allows one to factor in the effect of inflation on investment. For example, the value of Rs 100 will become equivalent to Rs 106 after a year if the rate of inflation is 6 per cent. By indexing the cost of acquisition of FMP units against the rate of inflation, one can reduce the quantum of capital gains and pay less tax. 

 Rahul can play a trick here to reduce his costs further by availing of the benefit of indexation for two successive financial years. He makes the investment before March 31 in one year and sells the investment after April 1 the next year.

 This may at times reduce the tax liability to zero. 

 But by investing in a bank fixed deposit, Raja would have to pay a tax at the rate of 33.66 per cent (including surcharge and education cess) on his interest income of Rs 11,267 (= 1,11,267-1,00,000). 

 The table shows that the dividend option is better if you are looking for a short-term investment in FMPs and the growth option wins in the long term horizon.

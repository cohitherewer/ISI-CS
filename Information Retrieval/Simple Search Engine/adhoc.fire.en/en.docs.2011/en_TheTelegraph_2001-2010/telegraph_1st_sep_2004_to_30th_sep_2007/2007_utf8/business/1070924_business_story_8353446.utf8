 Birla Sun Life Insurance Company has introduced an option to invest 100 per cent in equities under four of its individual unit-linked plans. The fund option called Maximiser will now be offered in its Ulips ClassicLife Premier, Supreme-Life, PrimeLife and PrimeLife Premier. The policyholders of these four plans will now have seven fund options to choose from. The fund options are Maximiser, Assure, Protector, Builder, Enhancer, Creator and Magnifier; with varying proportions of equity and debt. The insurer has also launched two micro-insurance products Bima Suraksha Super and Bima Dhan Sanchay designed for low to middle income group customers. 

 Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company has launched UnitGain Plus Gold, a regular premium unit-linked plan, after the insurer was asked to stop selling its actuary funded products.

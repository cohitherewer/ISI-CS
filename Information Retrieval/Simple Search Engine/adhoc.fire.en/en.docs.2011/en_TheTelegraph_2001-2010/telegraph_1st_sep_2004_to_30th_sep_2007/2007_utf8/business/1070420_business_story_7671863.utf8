 Orissa ready with Posco land

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 19: The Orissa government will be able to hand over more than 3,000 acres of land to Posco for its $12-bilion steel plant once the central permission is received. 

 We are doing our best to acquire the land and will do it in a just, humane and peaceful manner, Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik told reporters here after a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and the union steel and mines secretaries were also present. 

 Orissa chief secretary Ajit Kumar Tripathy said the state forest department had control over much of the land needed for the project and once a formal central clearance is received, the land could be handed over to Posco. 

 Of the total land requirement of 4,004 acres for the plant, villagers, who are reluctant to be resettled, hold just 438 acres, he added. 

 The remaining 3,566 acres are government land under the state forest department, he said. 

 The state had submitted a proposal to the Centre for the conversion of about 3,000 acres of forest land for the project. The state has already sanctioned 1,133 acres of land to the company, he said. 

 The Prime Minister has promised all necessary help and asked to expedite work on the project, Patnaik said after the hour-long meeting.

 Crisil pegs inflation at 5-5.5%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, Feb. 4: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy could be a happy man when he hears this. Even as the latest data shows inflation rising again to 6.11 per cent and many analysts believing that it could remain firm for a while, the Crisil Research amp; Information Services Ltd (Cris) has forecast that average inflation for the year will remain in the range of 5 per cent to 5.5 per cent.

 The central bank had forecast that inflation will be in the 5.0-5.5 per cent range by the end of the fiscal year in March 2007. 

 The Cris study suggested that the overall inflationary situation will ease due to a combination of rate hike by the RBI and duty cuts and fiscal policy measures taken by the government recently.

 The RBI on Wednesday hiked the repo rate by 25 basis points to 7.50 per cent to tame inflationary expectations. While the quarter of a percentage point hike in the short-term rate to a four-year high was in line with analyst expectations, Cris is of the view that given the robust industrial and economic growth in the fiscal, the rate hike aims to curb inflationary pressure.

 The current inflation scenario is dominated by supply constraints in primary articles, whereby the monetary tightening is not expected to impact much. However, the rate hike will keep a check on demand pressures by restricting credit growth and asset prices. In the medium term, while the rate hike is expected to curb the pressures emerging from the demand side, the duty cuts and fiscal policy measures taken by the government recently should help ease the overall inflationary situation, it said.

 Cris pointed out that while Reddys move to increase the repo rate and not alter the reverse repo rate is a continuation of its monetary tightening measures, it should be viewed in the context of the current growth momentum and the credit offtake. 

 In such circumstances, banks were more likely to borrow from the RBI than to lend to it. Justifying the hike in repo rate, which will now lead to higher cost of funds for banks, Reddy had said it is important to undertake a careful assessment of factors affecting inflation expectations. 

 While prices of primary food articles remained firm, that of manufactured products have been on the rise. Moreover, indications of demand pressures have been building up as reflected in rising consumption and investment demand. 

 There has also been a sizeable expansion in the demand for bank credit which is posing concerns and asset prices too have risen beyond the elevated levels.

 Reddy used other tools to tackle issues such as increase in asset prices. He increased the provisioning requirement for bank exposures in sectors that include real estate (excluding residential housing loans), capital markets and consumer loans (credit card receivables and personal loans).

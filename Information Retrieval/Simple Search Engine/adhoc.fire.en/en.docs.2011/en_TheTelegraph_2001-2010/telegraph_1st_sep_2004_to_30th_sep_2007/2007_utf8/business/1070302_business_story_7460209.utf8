 Foreigners put faith in FM

 March 1: Foreign brokerages are in no mood to dump finance minister P. Chidambaram despite his budget being shorn of reforms and peppered with regressive proposals for some sectors.

 The analyses by the brokerages have spared the finance minister from any scathing criticism of his proposals, while acknowledging the initiatives in agriculture and price control.

 Citigroup in its post-budget report said there was little to feel disconcerted about in the proposals as its expectations were low. 

 It feels the government has maintained continuity in key areas of infrastructure and fiscal consolidation as well as in agriculture and the social sector.

 Citigroup was also not unduly perturbed by the absence of any major reform initiatives. 

 It said rather than making policy statements and not following them up with actions, due to contradictions of coalition politics, the budget has not promised too much on reforms and hence does not run the risk of getting derailed.

 Goldman Sachs, too, appreciated the budget proposals, saying high tax collections have emboldened the government to step up expenditure in agriculture, infrastructure and social sectors which will consolidate the growth momentum. Goldman Sachs saw the budget as enabling long-term growth due to its emphasis on infrastructure, agriculture, and education spending. 

 Chidambaram also earned Goldman kudos for increasing health and education outlays and also for doubling the allocations in secondary education. The proposals on training and employment generation will also beef up growth, Goldman said.

 JP Morgan said the attempts to promote equitable and inclusive growth are long overdue. Recent electoral reverses for the ruling UPA coalition have likely hastened the pace of implementation. 

 It, however, said that the proposal on taxes will blunt corporate earnings growth over 2007-08. 

 The higher cess on corporate taxes and withdrawal of exemptions under certain heads implies that the earnings momentum could decelerate further, the brokerage said.

 PAN for mutuals

 Investors will have to use PAN instead of MIN for all mutual fund transactions, irrespective of the quantum, from tomorrow.

 With finance minister P. Chidambaram mandating the permanent account number (PAN) as the sole identification number for all transactions in the securities market, PAN would replace the mutual fund identification number (MIN) from March 2.

 MIN will be withdrawn from tomorrow and PAN will replace it as the sole identification number for mutual fund transactions from March 2, said A.P. Kurien, chairman of the Association of Mutual Funds of India.

 At present, it is mandatory to quote the PAN along with the MIN for investments of Rs 50,000 and above in mutual funds and initial public offerings.

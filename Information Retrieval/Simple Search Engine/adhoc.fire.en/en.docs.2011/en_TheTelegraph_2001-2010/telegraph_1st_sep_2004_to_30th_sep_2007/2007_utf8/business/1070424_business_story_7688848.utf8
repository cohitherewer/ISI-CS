 Bharti reaches out to small units

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 23: Bharti Airtel, the countrys top mobile player, today rolled out its national small and medium enterprise (SME) initiative from Calcutta.

 This will help Bharti increase its SME client base and provide customised solutions.

 Bharti Airtel is betting big on the east and expects the region to contribute 20 per cent to its turnover in the coming years.

 Calcutta and Bengal have a high concentration of SMEs. Our focus on SMEs has been moderate in the past. However, the company has decided to focus on this segment in the next few years. The east, especially Bengal, has outpaced growth in other states and we remain bullish on this region, said Manoj Kohli, president and CEO of Bharti Airtel.

 The broadband and telephone services division has around 10,000 employees.

 According to estimates, SMEs in India spend over $15 billion on IT and telecom requirements annually. Less than 20 per cent of the enterprises that own PCs have access to high-speed Internet. Moreover, there is only one telephone line for every 4.7 employees.

 New Delhi, May 20: Japanese consumer electronic company Panasonic plans to revamp its distribution network. The aim is to more than double its turnover to Rs 500 crore in 2007-08.

 We have a turnover of less than Rs 200 crore now. Revamping the distribution network is crucial to achieve the target as more than 80 per cent of sales come from this channel, said P. Yathindra Nath, director (sales and marketing) of Panasonic India.

 The company has about 2,000 multi-brand dealers selling its products. These include TVs, LCDs, plasma screens, digital cameras, camcorders, washing machines, air conditioners and audio players. 

 Panasonic plans to increase the number of such dealers to 7,000 in three years, said Nath. Despite having a wide range of products, Panasonic has failed to make a dent in the retail market unlike its multinational competitors such as LG, Samsung, Sony and Philips.

 The company has been too dependent on its distribution network. This reduces the component of sales through the direct channels. Therefore, the marketing and sales strategy has to be revised and divided between multi-brand dealers, exclusive dealers and retail channels, said Nath.

 Panasonic has about four exclusive stores in the country and will add another 30 in two years. Brand stores add a lot of value to the sales channel and helps increase customer confidence, he said.

 Moreover, the company is also aiming at strategic tieups with retail chains to get a major share in the stores. As part of our advertising campaigns, we will start in-store promotions aggressively in the next six months. This will help gain a lot of visibility. Consequently, we will also target Tier II and III cities, said Nath.

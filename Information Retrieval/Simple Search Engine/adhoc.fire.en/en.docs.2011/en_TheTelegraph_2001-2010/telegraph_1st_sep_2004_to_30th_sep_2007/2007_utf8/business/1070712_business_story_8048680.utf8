 Mumbai, July 11: France Telecom most famous for its Orange brand that was once used by Hutchison Essar in Mumbai is making a comeback to India after a gap of almost three years.

 The company has acquired the enterprise network and managed services businesses from GTL Ltd for around Rs 180 crore in an all-cash deal.

 It aims to start offering enterprise solutions to corporate houses here.

 Four years ago, France Telecom which was one of the early entrants into the countrys cellular service operations pulled out of India when it sold its 26 per cent stake in BPL Mobile Communications to the Essar group and a couple of overseas financial institutions in December 2004. 

 Essar had bought about 10 per cent of the stake for an undisclosed amount.

 The deal with GTL marks France Telecoms return but in a very small way.

 Through this acquisition, France Telecom will be able to offer voice and data based services to corporate houses. They will be providing Orange Business Services to a large base of corporate customers, said S.K. Roy, deputy chief operating officer at GTL Ltd.

 The GTL enterprise network and managed services business has been valued at 1.1 to 1.2 times of its current revenues. Orange will be paying the money upfront, a GTL official said.

 Manoj Tirodkar, CMD of GTL Ltd, said, Our enterprise business has the finest customer base.

 France Telecom plans to gradually step up its presence in the country. It will be applying for licences to offer domestic and overseas long distance telephony services in partnership with an unnamed local partner. 

 A couple of years later France Telecom might enter the telecom services business once again if an opportunity presents itself, Roy said.

 Its not known if France Telecom will use the Orange brand for its telecom services. The brand has been used before by Hutchison Max (the precursor to Hutchison Essar) under a licence from Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate.

 The Orange brand has had a chequered past and has changed hands several times.

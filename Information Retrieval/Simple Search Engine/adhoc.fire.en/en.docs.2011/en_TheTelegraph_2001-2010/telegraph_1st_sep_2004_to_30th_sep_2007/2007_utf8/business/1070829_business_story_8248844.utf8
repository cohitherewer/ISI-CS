 Calcutta, Aug. 28: Enterprise software company SAP AG has set a target of one lakh customers in emerging markets such as India and China by 2010. 

 The 10-billion-euro company has already doubled its customer base in India to 2,000 in just a year. 

 The unprecedented growth that we are seeing in India exemplifies how we shall realise our plan by 2010. Markets like India are at an inflection point when it comes to adoption of technology by businesses. It took us nine years in India to add 1,000 customers and only one to double it, said Henning Kagermann, CEO and chairman of the executive board of SAP.

 The company, which had last year announced an investment of $1 billion (Rs 4,500 crore) in India for five years, today reaffirmed its commitment.

 SAP set up its first India centre in Bangalore in 1998. It opened a centre in Gurgaon in 2006. 

 SAPs growth in the country has been fuelled by sectors such as BFSI, retail, manufacturing and public services.

 The company reported a 25 per cent growth in revenue in the first half of 2007.

 It is also targeting to increase the share of SME revenue to 50 per cent by 2010.

 Today, Indian SMEs are as aggressive in their business outlook as their larger counterparts and demand enterprises solutions that are powerful and robust enough to handle strong growth, SAP deputy CEO Leo Apotheker said.

 The company is planning to double its headcount by 2010. It now has 4,235 employees in the country.

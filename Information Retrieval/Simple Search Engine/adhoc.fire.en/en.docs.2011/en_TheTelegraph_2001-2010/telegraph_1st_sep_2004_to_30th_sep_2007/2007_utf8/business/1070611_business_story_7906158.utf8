 Lanka terror stirs fear in PSUs

 S.P.S. PANNU

 Oil trouble

 New Delhi, June 10: Indian Oil Corporation and the National Thermal Power Corporation are concerned over the deteriorating security conditions in Sri Lanka. IOC has already invested in the island nation and NTPC proposes to set up a power plant there.

 According to sources, the ministry of external affairs has been asked to convey the concerns of the two companies in its talks with the Sri Lankan government.

 The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelams (LTTE) attacks on fuel depots and Indian fishing vessels come at a time when Indian Oil is planning to expand its business in Trincomalee, which is administered by Sri Lanka and lies between India and the island nation.

 A senior Indian Oil official told The Telegraph, If an oil depot near Colombo can be attacked, Trincomalee is a sitting duck for the Tigers.

 Indian Oil has lined up plans for a lubricant blending plant at Trincomalee where it also wants to set up a facility to provide fuel to ships traversing along the international route.

 The heavy customs duty imposed on imported lubricants by Sri Lanka had prompted Indian Oil to draw up plans to set up a blending plant in the island nation with an investment of $5 million. The foundation stone for the plant has been laid and it was expected to be commissioned in 2007. 

 However, with the turmoil in the country, the project is likely to be delayed.

 According to Indian Oil officials, Sri Lanka offers an opportunity to set up refuelling facilities for ships. Nearly 150 vessels pass daily through this shipping lane linking West Asia to Singapore and there is no quality refuelling point on the route.

 IOC is keen on facilities in Trincomalee for this business. However, security is of paramount concern, with the LTTE acquiring air power and targeting oil installations in the country. 

 Its naval outfit is also stepping up attacks on Indian fishing vessels.

 NTPC and Ceylon Electricity Board have signed an agreement to set up a 500mw coal-based thermal plant in Trincomalee district. 

 The exact site for the location of the plant is posing a problem with the Sri Lankan government identifying Sampoor as the site. However, the town was captured recently from the Tigers. There has been a strong reaction against the plant from the local Tamils. This has been a cause of worry for the NTPC management.

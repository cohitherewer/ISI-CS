 Key meet on telecom security

 New Delhi, Feb. 4 (PTI): National security adviser M.K. Narayanan has convened a meeting of cabinet, home, defence, finance and telecom secretaries and security agencies to review the proposed guidelines to raise the FDI limit in telecom.

 The group, formed by the cabinet in December 2006, under the chairmanship of the national security adviser, will examine the security conditions concerning remote access to public switched telephone network (landline telecom network), sources said.

 Through remote access, foreign companies can monitor the traffic movement on the countrys landline telecom network. 

 Security agencies too had expressed concern over the issue. The group is likely to meet on February 5.

 However, the companies concerned had argued that denying remote access would inhibit growth of the ITeS sector.

 The department of telecom (DoT) had proposed that remote access would be provided from locations, which were approved by the licensor, that is DoT.

 For extending remote access facility to any other company/organisation prior approval of the licensor (DoT) will be required, DoT had said in its proposed note detailing guidelines for enhanced FDI in the telecom sector. 

 Sources said the meeting is likely to deliberate on a range of issues besides the remote access and may recommend changes in the guidelines for FDI for strengthening security network.

 Although the cabinet had given its nod on other key recommendations like offering top posts to foreigners and consultation with serious Indian partners for top level appointments, sources said the group may revisit some of these issues also.

 Security agencies have expressed problems being faced by them for effective implementation of various conditions. The DoT has been augmenting vigilance technical monitoring (VTM) cells to provide better technical interface between the telecom service providers and the security agencies.

 A committee has been set up consisting of representatives from the ministry of home affairs, Intelligence Bureau, ministry of defence, vigilance and licensing cells of DoT to recommend the activities that would be carried out by the VTM cells to help the security agencies.

 New tax code on the cards

 New Delhi, Aug. 7 (PTI): The new income tax code that will simplify and replace the nearly 50-year-old law will be introduced in Parliament in the next four months amid indications that there may be a finetuning of taxes but no radical changes in them.

 Over the weekend, finance minister P. Chidambaram had been working on drafting the code. After the code is tabled in Parliament, it will have to go through a process that will take quite some time before it is passed. 

 The finance minister says the salaried class makes for most of the individual tax payers, while the bulk of the taxes comes from the business class. 

 The honest tax-payer need not worry about any harassment. But the long wait for refunds will end once the refund banker system is extended throughout the country. 

 Yes, I even worked on Saturdays and Sundays. Before the end of the calendar year, we will introduce it in Parliament, Chidambaram said when asked if he was on course on enacting a new income tax code. 

 He said the code would begin from a zero base and would aim at simplification of the provisions of the income tax law. 

 It would completely replace the IT Act of 1961, Chidambaram said. 

 The history of income tax in India dates back to 1860, when the first income tax act was introduced. 

 After Independence, based on the Law Commissions report, the present income tax law was enacted in September, 1961.

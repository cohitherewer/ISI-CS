 Hutch suitors ready for final assault

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 9: The race to acquire Hutchison Essar Ltd (Hutch Essar) is now gathering speed. 

 Vodafone Group CEO Arun Sarin arrives in India tomorrow even as the other serious contender Reliance Communications Ltd (R-Com) seems to be moving with equal vigour. R-Com is believed to have roped in KPMG to conduct the due diligence of Hutchison Essar.

 R-Com is expected to get a call late this week or early next to conduct the due diligence where Hutch Essars key financial parameters will be analysed.

 KPMG, sources said, had advised Anil Ambanis telecom giant in the past. Last year, it, along with JM Morgan Stanley, played a crucial role in valuing the telecom business of the group. In a major restructuring, a host of group companies under the umbrella of Reliance Communication Venture Ltd (RCoVL) were reorganised after merging Reliance Infocomm into it. 

 Consequently, the groups operations in mobile (GSM), long-distance telephony and international long-distance services, voice and data businesses were brought under one entity, RCoVL, within a week of its listing. RCoVL has since been renamed Reliance Communications.

 However, an official from R-Com said he was not aware of KPMG being appointed by the company to conduct due diligence.

 The R-Com board is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss raising funds through a foreign currency convertible bond (FCCB) or external commercial borrowings (ECBs). It is believed that R-Com is raising the money to fund its bid for Hutch Essar.

 On Monday, a 15-member Vodafone team started its due diligence exercise at the Hutch House in Mumbai. Vodafone is being assisted by Ernst amp; Young and law firm Trilegal.

 Essar groups bankers, including Citibank and Morgan Stanley, are also expected to start examining the books of Hutch Essar shortly. These bankers have already extended funding pledges worth $25 billion to Essar. The Essar team includes Citibank, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered, Merrill Lynch and Lehmann Brothers.

 By the end of this month, we should start getting a clear picture. By then, the serious bidders are expected to have completed the due diligence exercise, sources added. 

 Meanwhile, Sunil Mittal said in Delhi that the terms of disengagement with Vodafone had not been discussed as yet. Mittal may meet Sarin to discuss the issue when the latter arrives.

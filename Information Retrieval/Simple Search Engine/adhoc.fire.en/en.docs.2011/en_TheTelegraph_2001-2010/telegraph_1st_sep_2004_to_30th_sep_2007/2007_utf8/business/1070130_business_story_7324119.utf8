 Calcutta, Jan. 29: Firstsource Solutions Ltd, the pure play BPO outfit of ICICI Bank, has earmarked Rs 180 crore from its ongoing public offering for acquisitions that will be finalised before March 2008.

 However, we cannot give further details on the acquisition plan at the moment, said Mathew Vallance, president (Europe), Firstsource Solutions Ltd. If you go by our past acquisitions, you will see that we bought six companies in India and outside, between $15 million and $40 million. We have proposed to keep aside $42 million from the IPO proceeds, he added. He, however, did not specify whether it would be a domestic or foreign acquisition.

 Firstsource Solutions has recently entered the healthcare segment and has already acquired a business process outsourcing company in the US. Firstsource has 20 delivery centres 11 in India, six in the US, two in the UK and one in Argentina. 

 The company has recently acquired 1,00,000 sq ft space at Technopolis near Salt Lake to expand its operations here. There are 1,078 employees working at our Calcutta centre and the headcount will increase to 1,800, Vallance added. 

 Firstsource is also setting up a BPO centre having 550 seats in Chennai and a 35,000-sq-ft centre in the Philippines. The Philippines centre will have 350 seats, Vallance said. The company will spend Rs 46.2 crore to set up the new facilities.

 Firstsource Solutions has come out with a public issue of 6.93 crore shares of which 6 crore are fresh equity and the remaining 93 lakh shares are being offered for sale by ICICI Bank. 

 The private sector bank currently holds a 29.8 per cent stake in the BPO company, and post-IPO, its shareholding will come down to 20 per cent.

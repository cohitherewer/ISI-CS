The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 R-Com sets a Classic example

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 2: A CDMA handset for less than $19? Yes, the seemingly improbable is now a reality with Reliance Communications (R-Com) cutting prices of its Classic handsets to Rs 777. 

 This comes at a time when other manufacturers have lowered the prices of handsets by almost 40 per cent because of fierce competition in the entry-level segment.

 While R-Com said this was an introductory price and would be valid for a limited period till stocks last, it expected to hold the price line during May.

 Over three million handsets have been sold under the Classic brand since its launch last year. The pricing is the first of its kind in the country. However, there is no provision for payment in instalments under the scheme, said S.P. Shukla, president, personal business, R-Com.

 Other handsets under R-Coms Classic brand for the limited period offer are priced at Rs 844, Rs 888 and Rs 1,750. The minimum price of a Tata Indicom CDMA handset is Rs 1,000, while an entry-level GSM phone costs between Rs 1,550 (Motorola) and Rs 1,750 (Nokia).

 R-Com is the first CDMA operator to own a handset brand in India. The handsets, however, are sourced from abroad. In the CDMA segment, service providers usually tie up with handset manufacturers to bundle offers with phones. Tata Indicom operates though such tie-ups. R-Com also claims its handset sales are second after Nokia. 

 Around seven million subscribers are added to the mobile fold every month. Hence, manufacturers are trying out different models to leverage on the scale of operations. Prices are set to fall further with cost of hardware components like the LCD screen dropping every quarter, said Vinnie Mehta, executive director of the Manufacturers Association for Information Technology.

 Globally, in the CDMA segment, one has to buy the phone from the operator. Service providers in some countries like the US even offer them free for a fixed number of years to recover the cost through contract rentals.

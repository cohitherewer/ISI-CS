 Oil retailers clamour for price hike

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 DEMAND DRAFT

 New Delhi, June 19: Public sector oil marketing companies are lobbying for a hike in petrol and diesel prices following a renewed surge in the global price of crude oil.

 The average price of the Indian basket of crude has shot up by $2 per barrel this month to touch $67.61.

 This has led to a loss of Rs 6-7 per litre on the sale of petrol and diesel. In February, the government reduced prices when petrol became cheaper by Rs 2 a litre and diesel by Re 1. International crude prices have risen 10-12 per cent since then. Senior officials feel the government may be forced to raise prices by at least a small amount, if the price spurt continues.

 The problem has become serious as the oil companies will have to declare their first quarter results soon. If the current trend continues, we will have to show that our profits have been wiped out, a senior Indian Oil official told The Telegraph. 

 Since the move has political implications, the government will arrive at a decision only after consulting the Left parties, which are opposed to such hikes. Part of the oil losses suffered by the refiners is borne by upstream PSUs ONGC and GAIL while the government chips in with oil bonds. 

 India imports a basket of crude that comprises 55 per cent of the cheaper Gulf variety and 45 per cent of the more expensive sweet Brent crude. The cheaper crude has more sulphur and is difficult to process. To minimise the import bill, Indian companies blend high-sulphur crude with the sweeter variety. 

 The oil trade attributes the price spurt to tensions surrounding the USs nuclear stand-off with Iran and civil strife in Nigeria, the worlds eighth-largest producer.

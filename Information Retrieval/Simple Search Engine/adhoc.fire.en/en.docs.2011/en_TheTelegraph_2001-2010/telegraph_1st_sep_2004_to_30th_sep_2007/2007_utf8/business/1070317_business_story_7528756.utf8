 Posco on Arcelor Mittal radar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Mumbai, March 16: Steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittals appetite for takeovers hasnt been slaked as yet: he is now believed to be stalking Posco, the worlds third largest steel company, prompting the South Korean steelmaker to start erecting its defences.

 Unconfirmed reports emanating from South Korea said Arcelor Mittal could be interested in mounting a hostile takeover bid for the Pohang-based company which is worth around $36 billion.

 The Korea Economic Daily, quoting a Posco official, reported on Friday that a senior Arcelor Mittal executive had expressed interest in the South Korean companys merger and acquisition (M amp;A) strategy when he visited Seoul last month to meet Posco chief executive Lee Ku-Taek.

 Though Posco denied the report saying that there had been no discussion of a merger or acquisition with Arcelor Mittal, it is not taking any chance. Officials of the company said in South Korea that while 40 per cent of its shares are owned by friendly investors, it wants to increase that figure to be truly safe against any hostile bid.

 The company is understood to have a fragmented share ownership structure that could spark hostile takeover attempts. Poscos plan is to increase such friendly stakes to 50 per cent by the end of the year. A large part of Poscos equity is owned by overseas investors.

 Arcelor Mittals spokersperson could not be reached to confirm the developments.

 Posco had entered into an alliance with Nippon Steel of Japan, the worlds second largest steelmaker, in 2000 to better position itself in the changing dynamics of the global steel industry. Nippon has an equity stake of 5 per cent in Posco.

 Mittal Steel had bought Arcelor last year for over $33 billion to form Arcelor Mittal. In January last year, Mittal had made an unsolicited bid to buy Arcelor for 18.6 billion euros ($22.7 billion). Mittal had offered 28.21 euros a share for Arcelor. It had come after Arcelor acquired Dofasco, Canadas biggest flat steel producer. 

 After witnessing initial hiccups when two of his bids were rejected by the French company even as there was opposition from other quarters, Mittal was successful five months later.

 The Korea Economic Daily also reported that Roland Junck, who is an adviser to Mittal, had in February also wanted to know from the Korean company about its merger and acquisition strategies in Asia. 

 It is understood that he also mooted the idea of both Posco and Arcelor Mittal working together in Orissa. Both giants are planning steel projects in the state.

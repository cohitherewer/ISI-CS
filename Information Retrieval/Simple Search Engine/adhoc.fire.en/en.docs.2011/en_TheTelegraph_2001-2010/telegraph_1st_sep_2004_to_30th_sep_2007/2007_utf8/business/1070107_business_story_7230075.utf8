 Iran in talks with Essar

 Singapore/New Delhi, Jan. 6 (Reuters): Irans state oil refining company is in talks with the Essar group to build a new refinery in southern Iran, part of Tehrans $18-billion drive to meet soaring domestic fuel demand.

 The estimated $2 billion-plus investment in a new 300,000 barrel per day (bpd) plant to process Irans heavy crude would give the Opec members stagnant refining sector a boost and give Essar a foothold in the oil-rich but politically sensitive country, where it is already in talks over a steel plant.

 We are studying a refinery in Bandar Abbas with Essar of India, Akhbari Shad, director of international affairs for the National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company (NIORDC), told Reuters. Bandar Abbas is a port town in the south.

 Shad declined to give more details or say when a deal might be struck. Negotiations over Iranian oil investments often take years; some major deals have also collapsed at the 11th hour.

 An official with the Essar group told Reuters: We want to strengthen our relations with Iran. We are talking to Iran for setting up a refinery, based on crude oil to be given by them.

 We are (also) in talks to buy a stake in some exploration and production blocks so that we can get gas for our planned steel plant, said the official, who declined to be named. He said production would be geared primarily to the local market.

 Essar plans to set up three steel plants in West Asia, including a joint venture to build a 1.5 million tonnes a year steel plant in Iran.

 Its oil refining subsidiary Essar Oil launched Indias second private-sector refinery late last year and will ramp it up to 210,000 bpd by mid-year.

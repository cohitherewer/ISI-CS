 Maruti dishes out discount spread

 New Delhi, June 11: Maruti Udyog is offering discounts of Rs 5,000 to Rs 35,000 on several models for the next five days.

 The discount, effective till June 15, is available on the Maruti 800, Omni, Alto, Esteem, Versa and on the petrol models of the WagonR and Swift, said a company spokesperson. 

 No discounts have been offered on the Swift diesel and the SX4.

 Analysts said the move, which kickstarted on June 1, was expected to counter the effects of the recent hike in interest rates that was affecting sales.

 Last month, Maruti managing director Jagdish Khattar said the company would offer incentives to dealers and customers to offset the impact of higher interest rates.

 Adhik mahina, which falls this month, is also seen as a reason behind these discounts. This period comes once every three years and is considered inauspicious for buying any product. The discounts will help Maruti increase its June sales.

 The company is also planning to close its plants for scheduled maintenance from June 17-24, said a spokesperson.

 Maruti will shut down the plants at Manesar and Gurgaon for maintenance, but dealer despatches will not be affected by the shutdown, the spokesperson added.

 It is part of our scheduled maintenance routine twice a year, he said, but added the company had no plans to cut production.

 Last week, some vehicle makers said they were cutting down on production as demand had weakened.

 Khattar, however, said there were delays in the delivery of its Swift hatchback and the newly launched SX4 sedan because demand had exceeded supply.

 LIC Housing takes deposit route for cash

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, May 8: LIC Housing Finance today announced a fixed deposit scheme with an interest rate of 9 per cent for three years and 9.25 per cent for five years.

 The company is offering FDs for the first time and at higher rates than its competitors. 

 Rival HDFC offers 8.75 per cent for deposits of 36 months and 8.75 per cent for deposits of 60 months. 

 The LIC Housing scheme has been rated FAAA/Stable by Crisil, indicating the highest degree of safety. 

 The minimum deposit is Rs 10,000, and thereafter it is in multiples of Rs 1,000. 

 The company has appointed Integrated Enterprises (India) to mobilise funds.

 LIC agents will also market the scheme which will be launched in 30 cities.

 We are seeking to diversify our sources of funds and de-risk our borrowings. This is the first time the company is reaching out to retail depositors and I am sure the trust that the company enjoys will help us make this scheme a big success, S.K. Mitter, CEO of LIC Housing said. 

 Mitter told The Telegraph that the company primarily raised money through loans from banks and other financial institutions. It also received financial support from parent LIC.

 The cost of borrowings has been going up and we want to reduce this by going to the retail individual, he said. 

 He said the company is targeting Rs 1,000 crore in the first year.

 We have a good network for mobilising these funds. Apart from more than 115 area offices, LIC agents can also help us. They can be paid some commission, he added. 

 The companys net interest margin was over 2 per cent, he said. The rate we are offering is one of the best in the industry, he said.

 Investors are cashing in on the high rates being offered by banks by diverting funds from other instruments such as postal savings.

 Bank deposits increased by 23 per cent during 2006-07 compared with 18.1 per cent in the previous year. The high growth rate is expected to be maintained this year.

 Set up in 1989, LIC Housing has 115 offices and a representative office in Dubai. 

 It enjoys AAA rating from Crisil on its NCD programme indicating highest safety with regard to the ability to service interest and repay capital.

 During the third quarter of 2006-07, the company sanctioned Rs 1,216 crore and disbursed Rs 1,104 crore.

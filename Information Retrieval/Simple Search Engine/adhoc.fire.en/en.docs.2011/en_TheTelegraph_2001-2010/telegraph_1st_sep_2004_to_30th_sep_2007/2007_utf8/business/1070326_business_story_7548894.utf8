 Slowdown in bank credit growth

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 25: Reserve Bank of Indias measures to cool down bank credit growth and inflationary pressure have started taking effect. The apex banks latest weekly data on scheduled commercial banks business in the country shows a 22.5 per cent growth in bank credit this fiscal till March 2 compared with 23.4 per cent in the year-ago period.

 During the financial year so far, banks disbursed Rs 3,35,027 crore new loans to the non-food sector and Rs 4,299 crore as food credit.

 Outstanding bank credit as on March 2 was Rs 1,846,403 crore, representing a year-on-year growth of 29.8 per cent. The growth was 32.5 per cent in the previous year.

 Last month, commercial banks lent Rs 39,606 crore, of which Rs 37,779 crore was given to the non-food sector. The credit growth in February was, however, significantly higher than in January when banks issued only Rs 14,289 crore fresh loans. The credit growth was still higher at Rs 82,614 crore in December, when the Reserve Bank increased the cash reserve ratio (CRR) in two phases.

 Following the second hike in CRR (again in two phases) in February and March, banks credit growth is expected to slow down further by the end of this fiscal.

 The slowdown in credit growth is largely attributable to low availability of lendable funds and increase in lending rates by commercial banks following hikes in CRR. However, the sustained demand for credit may negate the impact of higher lending rates and result in a higher growth in advances.

 Bank deposits, however, have been growing on the back of a continuous rise in interest rates during recent months. Aggregate public deposits with banks stood at Rs 2,467,048 crore on March 2 against Rs 1,994,226 crore on March 3, 2006. 

 The growth in bank deposits during the current financial year so far was Rs 383,805 crore, or 18.2 per cent, over the corresponding period in the previous fiscal. 

 Most of these incremental deposits came in the form of fixed deposits, which grew by more than two-folds to Rs 352,886 crore from Rs 170,545 crore a year ago.

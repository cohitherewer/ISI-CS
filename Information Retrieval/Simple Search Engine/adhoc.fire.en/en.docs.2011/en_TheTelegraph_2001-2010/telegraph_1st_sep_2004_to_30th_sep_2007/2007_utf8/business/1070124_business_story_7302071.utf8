 Software exports set to top $30 bn

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, Jan. 23: Software and services exports from the country will exceed $30 billion in the current financial year and if the buoyancy continues, the industry could achieve the aspired target of $60 billion exports by 2010.

 Revealing this optimistic outlook, the National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) today said the industrys overall revenue was expected to grow to $47.8 billion this fiscal, a 10-fold increase over $4.8 billion in 1997-98.

 With most of the leading infotech companies dishing out mouth-watering quarterly numbers for the third quarter, the Nasscom numbers could not have come at a more appropriate time. The industry body is quite optimistic that in another three years, export revenues would rise by $30 billion.

 Releasing the findings of Strategic Review 2007, Nasscom chairman B. Ramalinga Raju, who is also the founder and chairman of Satyam Computer Services, said the industry was doing better than expected despite the challenges.

 According to Raju, the domestic infotech market is showing a huge promise, though exports remain the mainstay of the sector. 

 The infotech market in the country has broken out of the hardware-linked growth pattern and the total size of the domestic market is expected to cross $15.9 billion in 2006-07, a growth of 21 per cent over the previous year.

 Outside of the four metros, personal computer sales have risen three to four times. The smaller towns and population are adapting technology faster, Raju said. 

 While corporate houses are contributing to the growth by spending more on software, increased outsourcing remains a major source of revenue for the infotech sector.

 According to the review, the Indian IT-ITeS sector (including the domestic and exports segments) is expected to exceed $47.8 billion in annual revenue in 2006-07, an increase of nearly 28 per cent.

 While the contribution to the gross domestic product is estimated at 5.4 per cent, up from 4.8 per cent last year, service and software exports accounted for a major chunk and it contributed $31.3 billion, thereby beating the forecast of 32.6 per cent growth.

 Of the $47.8 billion, IT services is expected to generate $23.7 billion ($18.1 billion from exports), ITeS-BPO close to $9.5 billion ($8.3 billion from exports) and engineering services and R amp;D $6.5 billion. On the other hand, hardware is expected to contribute $8.2 billion.

 While investments by multinational companies reached an unprecedented scale over $10 billion to be invested over the next few years the total IT software and services employment is slated to reach 1.6 million in 2006-07, up from 1.29 million last fiscal.

 Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said there were certain challenges which the industry is now addressing. The most important is regarding human resources. 

 The skill sets available to the industry are not matching what we need, he said and added that efforts were being made to set up finishing schools to address skill gaps.

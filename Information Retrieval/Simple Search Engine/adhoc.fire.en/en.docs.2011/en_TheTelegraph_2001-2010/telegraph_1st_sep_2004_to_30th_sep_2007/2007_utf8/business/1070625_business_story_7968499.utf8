 STYLE STATEMENT

 Bangalore, June 24: Titan Industries has decided to focus on its Edge brand, which comprises a range of slim watches.

 The watches are 3.5 mm thick and are claimed to be the slimmest commercially available wristwatches in the world. They come in 26 varieties, including all-steel, all-gold and all-black looks. 

 The company will spend Rs 5 crore to promote the brand, which includes a commercial starring brand ambassador Aamir Khan.

 The collection is priced in the range of Rs 5,425 and Rs 11,000.

 The watches will be available in the companys showrooms across the country.

 Harish Bhatt, chief operating officer, Titan Industries, said the companys wristwatch business grew 21 per cent in 2006-07. 

 Sales of the Edge brand increased 58 per cent in the year. The company expects its wristwatch business to grow 25 per cent this fiscal.

 Business head Ajay Chawla said the company sold 26 lakh watches last year, of which 75,000 were Edge watches. 

 Titan Industries aims to sell 1 lakh pieces of Edge this year. Officials said the company would use its internal database for direct mailing to prospective customers and credit card holders as part of its marketing thrust.

 Titan ranks third after Seiko and Rado in West Asian and Southeast Asian countries. The Edge could find a market in those countries as well, the officials said.

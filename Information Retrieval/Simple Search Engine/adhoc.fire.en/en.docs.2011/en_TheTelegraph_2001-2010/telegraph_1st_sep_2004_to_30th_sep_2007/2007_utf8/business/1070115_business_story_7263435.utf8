 Honda to set up 2nd plant in Rajasthan

 Takedagawa: All smiles 

 New Delhi, Jan. 14: Japanese carmaker Honda Motors will set up its second small car plant in Rajasthan. 

 The company is in discussion with the state government to shortlist a suitable location for the project, which will require about 500-700 acres. 

 The plant involves an investment of about Rs 900 crore and will have an initial capacity of 50,000 units per annum. 

 The new plant will also have a suppliers park, which will house Hondas network of ancillary units. Sources said this will take Hondas total investment in Rajasthan to Rs 2,000 crore. For this purpose, the company has signed a letter of intent with the Rajasthan state government. 

 In an official statement issued today, Hondas joint venture company, Honda Siel Cars India (HSCI), said, We have been in discussion with several states for the new plant, but eventually selected Rajasthan because of its proximity to Hondas biggest market the north and the east which account for about 45 per cent of the total HSCI sales. Logistics and managerial convenience have also prompted the decision. 

 The company had considered three other locations Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. 

 Honda Motor is working on a small car with 1.2 litre engine for the Indian market at its research and development facility in Japan. The model is for India but will also serve as a global product in the small car segment for the company. 

 At a conference last week, Masahiro Takedagawa, president and CEO, HSCI, said, We are eyeing the premium hatchback segment and the new product is being developed to conform to Indias small car definition 1.2 litre petrol engine with a length of less than 4 metre. This will enable us to avail of excise concessions in the country.

 At our second manufacturing facility, our aim is to manufacture 1.5 lakh small car units, which will be launched in another 2-3 years, Takedagawa added.

 Singh rolls out strategy to stay ahead in car race

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Jan. 29: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today unveiled the ambitious automotive mission plan (AMP) envisaging a turnover of $145 billion by 2016, an almost six-fold increase over the current level of $35 billion. The blueprint aims at making India a global hub for automobiles and auto parts with exports targeted to touch $35 billion, which is the current size of the domestic market.

 Heavy industries minister Santosh Mohan Dev said the increased turnover will account for 10 per cent of the countrys GDP, up from 5 per cent at present and provide additional employment to 25 million people by 2016.

 The current exports of the automotive sector are valued at about $4.1 billion...They need to be increased to $35 billion to make India a substantial player in the global market, Dev said.

 The AMP is in favour of tax concessions and liberal labour laws to boost investment and R amp;D in the auto sector. It states that a substantial increase in exports will require an investment of approximately $40 billion. 

 The task is feasible since the industry has already announced plans to invest one-third of this amount in the last 12-18 months. Achieving the target will require a four-fold increase in the level of investment in the current year, said Mahindra amp; Mahindras Pawan Goenka.

 The countrys automotive sector has been witnessing a 17 per cent growth over the last five years. An investment of Rs 50,000 crore has gone into this sector that has reported a turnover of Rs 1,65,000 crore. While Maruti Udyog, the countrys largest car maker, said AMP will help the industry identify key areas to boost growth, Hyundai Motor said the government should be consistent in framing policies since the industry requires adequate time to adopt any changes in the norms. 

 Hyundai has been seeking clarity on the definition of small car, which according to the auto policy is 3,800 mm in length, while the finance ministry in last years budget gave excise benefits to small cars with a length 4,000 mm.

 Laying down a broad outline of the report, Dev said the sectors focus on research and development was inadequate and the AMP aims at providing incentives to R amp;D. 

 The AMP also proposes to set up a monitoring committee, which will function under the chairmanship of Ramesh Chandra Panda, secretary, ministry of heavy industries and public enterprises.

 While monitoring the progress, the committee will state the time schedule for implementing the mission plan. 

 The committee will include representatives from the ministries of finance, road transport, commerce, shipping, railways, petroleum and natural gas and human resource development. 

 Releasing the AMP at his residence, the Prime Minister said the automotive industry must invest in energy efficient and environment friendly technologies.

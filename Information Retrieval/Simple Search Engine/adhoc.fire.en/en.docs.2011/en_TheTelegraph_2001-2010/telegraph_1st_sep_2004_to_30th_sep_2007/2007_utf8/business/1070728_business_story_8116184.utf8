 Calcutta, July 27: Eveready plans to focus more on non-battery products in the FMCG segment because high zinc prices are hurting its battery business.

 We are looking at reducing our dependence on battery-related products. The company wants to take on and acquire local (FMCG) brands that do not have the distributor reach or the capital to look at a national presence, Deepak Khaitan, vice-chairman and managing director, Eveready Industries India Limited, said here today.

 Zinc prices have jumped 150 per cent in the 12 months till January, pushing up battery prices by as much as 50 per cent.

 A stiff customer resistance to rising prices have started affecting Evereadys sales from the third quarter of the last fiscal.

 Net sales of the company for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 fell to Rs 184.92 crore from Rs 226.65 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.

 The company suffered losses of Rs 12.31 crore in the first quarter compared with a profit of Rs 12.18 crore a year ago.

 Eveready will launch a slew of FMCG products in the next two years on the lines of Eveready Poweron, a mosquito coil.

 The flashlight division has also reported a falling growth rate in volumes, especially in the brass segment which is popular in rural areas.

 We have introduced a new segment of flashlights to give consumers a cheaper option. This is the light emitting diode or LED segment, Khaitan added.

 Paswan voices concern over high gas price

 Paswan: Cause for worry

 New Delhi, Aug. 5: Fertiliser minister Ram Vilas Paswan has warned the government that fertiliser production will become unviable if it fixes delivered gas prices at above $5 per million British thermal unit (mbtu).

 Delivered price is that at which gas is sold at the factory gate.

 In an earlier letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Paswan stated that for every dollar increase in the gas prices beyond the current fixed level of $2.50 per mbtu, the government would have to pay an additional subsidy of Rs 1,800 crore. The minister has now warned that despite the burgeoning subsidy bill, a price of $5 per mbtu will make fertiliser units unviable.

 I have already informed the government about our concerns over viability in case of high gas prices, Paswan told The Telegraph.

 Fertiliser and power plants buy a large portion of their gas needs at a fixed price of $2.5 per mbtu. About 50 per cent of the total gas consumed in the country is sold at fixed or administered prices.

 However, gas companies, including Reliance Industries, want to hike this price to $4.5-6.5 per mbtu. Fertiliser companies currently buy part of their gas from the open market at delivered prices ranging between $4 per mbtu and $5 per mbtu. 

 The cabinet has set up a committee of secretaries, which will report to the cabinet committee on economic affairs on a workable pricing mechanism. If the government agrees to price gas at $4.5 per mbtu, the already bloated fertiliser subsidy bill will go up further by Rs 3,600 crore. If it is hiked to $6.5 per mbtu, the bill will go up by Rs 7,200 crore. 

 Fertiliser prices are kept at a low level by the government to please the farm lobby. With suicides by farmers unable to cope up with rising cost of agriculture becoming a nation-wide political issue, there is a little chance of passing on the higher price of gas to farmers.

 Certain sections of the government want gas pricing to be market-determined. However, the fertiliser and power ministries are opposed to this idea. The power ministry has also written against raising natural gas prices arbitrarily.

 Besides the subsidy cost and the fact that pricing beyond a point could affect the viability of fertiliser plants, officials said globally, oil companies negotiated low rates for long-term supplies.

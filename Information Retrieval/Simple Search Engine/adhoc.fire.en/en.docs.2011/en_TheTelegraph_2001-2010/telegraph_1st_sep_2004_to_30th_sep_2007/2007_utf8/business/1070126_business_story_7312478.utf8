 Assam Co in SEZ pact

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 25: Assam Company Limited has signed an MoU with Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited (GSPC) to set up a special economic zone (SEZ) hydrocarbon park in Gujarat at an investment of Rs 2,000 crore.

 The companies will form a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for this purpose. GSPC will nominate the chairman of the SPV board.

 The idea for a hydrocarbon park took shape when our chairman, K.K. Jajodia, visited Gujarat. The state, with its high concentration of refineries, is in need of such a park, which will provide services like seismic study, drilling and logging, said Abhay Chawdhry, chief financial officer and director of Assam Company.

 Though the onus of obtaining approval for the SEZ is on the Gujarat government, Chawdhry does not foresee any problem. He expects the park to be up and running by 2010.

 A joint working group will be formed with two members each from Assam Company and GSPC in the next couple of weeks. In the next one year, this group will identify the site for the project, determine the acquisition cost and the manner in which it will be shared and look at potential partners for the park. The financing mode and the debt-equity ratio would also be decided in the course of the year, Chawdhry said.

 The shareholding pattern will be based on the amount of money contributed by each company.

 The Calcutta-based Assam Company plans to invest $100 million (Rs 450 crore) in its oil and gas business over the next two-and-a-half years.

 Archies set to double turnover

 Bright future

 Calcutta, Aug. 13: Archies Limited plans to double its turnover from Rs 105 crore by 2010.

 The greeting card and gifts major, which has made a foray into retail with company-owned stores, will raise around Rs 16 crore from convertible warrants by next year.

 We expect our retail foray to be a growth driver, contributing to almost 70 per cent of our turnover by 2010. The conversion next year will be part of our fund raising efforts to open stores across the country, said Pramod Arora, executive director of Archies Ltd.

 Archies has already opened 90 company-owned stores across 13 states.

 We have about 400 franchisee outlets across the country. The rapid development of malls has made it imperative for companies to move fast to find the right space at the right price. Franchisees will not always be available. Therefore, we decided to start ourselves, Arora said.

 Archies plans to open 150 more stores by 2010.

 Around six of these stores will be in the east while the north will have 20. Around 20 to 25 stores will be in the west and the remaining will be in the south.

 Each store will require investments worth Rs 25 lakh.

 Mall development in the east is mostly concentrated in Bengal. So most of our outlets will be based in the state, particularly in Calcutta, Arora added.

 After the board meeting in June 2007, Archies allotted 250,000 equity shares with a face value of Rs 10 each at a premium of Rs 149.50, amounting to Rs 159.50 per share fully paid up to Bennett Coleman amp; Co Ltd.

 The allotment had raised about Rs 4 crore. This was more of a strategic partnership arrangement to use media space, Arora said.

 At the extraordinary general meeting of the company held on April 19, 2007, it was resolved that from time to time the board could issue, in one or more tranches, 500,000 warrants convertible to equity shares. These will have a face value of Rs 10 each at a premium of Rs 149.50, amounting to Rs 159.50 per share. They will be issued on a preferential basis to promoter, promoter groups and others.

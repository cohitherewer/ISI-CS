The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Go-ahead for Yule recast

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Feb. 22: The cabinet today decided to hive off the electrical and engineering divisions of Calcutta-based Andrew Yule into separate subsidiaries Yule Engineering and Yule Electrical.

 The government will infuse Rs 87 crore into the company as equity. 

 In addition, the cabinet has also permitted Andrew Yule to disinvest in its three subsidiaries Phoenix Yule, Tide Water Oil and Dishergarh Power. 

 The three companies have 1,500 employees on its roll. The Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) will find joint venture partners for the 51 per cent stakes in the companies.

 ONGC had done a due diligence on Tide Water when Subir Raha was chairman of the oil PSU. However, after Rahas exit the plans for Tide Water have been put on the backburner.

 National Instruments move

 The cabinet approved the transfer of assets, liabilities and manpower of Calcutta-based National Instruments Limited (NIL) to Jadavpur University.

 Taking over the infrastructure of National Instruments will promote industry-institute interaction, technology development, permit new academic programmes in emerging areas and private-public partnership, said P.R. Das Munshi, Union minister for information and broadcasting.

 The government will write off equity capital of Rs 8.31 crore, loans of Rs 90.55 crore and interest of Rs 138.08 crore. 

 It will also write off dues of ministries of defence and home affairs worth Rs 2.24 crore and Rs 0.87 crore respectively. 

 The government will also provide budgetary support in the form of grants to the tune of Rs 1.58 crore to meet salary arrears and pay off statutory dues.

 In addition, there is also a budgetary support of Rs 23 lakh to pay off creditors. About 68 employees will be transferred to the university.

 Mine policy

 The controversial new mineral policy was referred to a group of ministers to sort out the differences over FDI and export of iron ore. 

 The group of ministers will also prepare the norms on auction of coal mines to end users which are mainly the companies in cement, power and steel. 

 The note on the auction of coal mines says the bidding will be on technical, physical and financial parameters.

 Part of the proceeds from the auction will be used to rehabilitate tribals for community development projects.

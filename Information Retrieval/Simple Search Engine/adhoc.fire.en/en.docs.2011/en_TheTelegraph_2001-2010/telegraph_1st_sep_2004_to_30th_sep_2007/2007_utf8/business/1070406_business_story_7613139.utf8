 Steel firms to hold price line in April

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 5: North Block, which is trying to combat the rising rate of inflation, has got an assurance from steel manufacturers that they would not increase the price of the commodity in April.

 However, cement makers continued to hold out, refusing to lower prices.

 A steel industry delegation, led by Jindal Steel vice-chairman and managing director Sajjan Jindal, assured finance minister P. Chidambaram that the industry will hold prices for this month despite higher input costs and pressure on margins.

 We will not increase the prices in April, but will review the situation next month, Jindal said. The assurance came amidst market rumours that prices may be raised by Rs 1,000-2,000 a tonne this month.

 Jindal said railway freight and finances have gone up lately and the industrys decision to hold the price line would strain its profitability. However, he added prices would not be hiked this month to help the government tame rising inflation. The steel delegation comprised Indian Steel Alliance head Moosa Raza and representatives of SAIL, Tata Steel, Jindal Steel and Power and JSW Steel.

 Finance ministry officials also expected cement makers to relent as cheaper direct exports from Pakistan were likely to arrive in larger quantities soon.

 ONGC staff on warpath

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: ONGC officials will take direct action if the government does not reverse its decision to scrap Public Enterprises Selection Boards (PESB) choice of R.S. Sharma for the post of chairman-cum-managing director.

 The Association of Scientific and Technical Officers, which represents 23,000 officials of the company, wants the government to restore the panel selected by the board.

 Sanjay Goel, central working committee president of the association, said the officers had sought an appointment with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and would submit a representation to him on the issue.

 The association has questioned the governments motive in bringing in a person from the private sector to head the organisation.

 Goel said petroleum minister Murli Deora has not been able to give the association any reason for Sharmas selection being quashed. Such a thing has never happened before, he added.

 The association said, The cancellation of the selected panel drawn by the PESB and duly recommended by all required channels for the top post of ONGC, in which R.S. Sharma, director (finance) was chosen as CMD, has given a blow to the pride, dignity and image of ONGC in general and the officers community in particular.

 The government wants ONGC to be instrumental in ensuring the energy security of the nation, but it has not been able to decide on the appointment of the chairman and managing director for the last nine months.

 Apex court stalls HPL board meet

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: The Supreme Court today put on hold a Calcutta High Court order that helped the Bengal government wrest control of Haldia Petrochemicals. 

 A board meeting of HPL scheduled for October 1 to discuss a number of pending issues has now been pushed back by four weeks because of the order.

 The meeting was announced last Friday a few hours after the high court set aside the Company Law Boards (CLB) order to sell the Bengal governments share in HPL to The Chatterjee Group (TCG). 

 A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhan deferred the high court order for four weeks after TCG counsel F.S. Nariman sought a status quo on the ground that the company had not been given a copy of the judgment.

 According to TCG, it had been furnished only with an authenticated copy of the speaking order and had not been provided the final judgement.

 Parties can seek a further extension if they do not get copies of the high court judgment by then, the court said. 

 The state government, represented by senior counsel K.K. Venugopal, agreed to the order.

 While seeking to stall the high court order, the TCG counsel had sought to restrain HPL from holding the board meeting scheduled for October 1, which would decide on contentious issues such as allotment of shares to lenders, appointment of auditors and holding of annual general meetings of shareholders.

 The Chatterjee Group also wanted the share allotment to the Indian Oil Corporation to be quashed.

 The company appealed to the apex court to direct the state government to transfer the shares of Haldia Petrochem to it in accordance with the agreement between the parties.

 It also wanted the reconstitution of the board of directors of HPL and the right to nominate a majority of directors in its capacity as the majority shareholder of the company.

 The Supreme Court issued notices to Haldia Petrochem, the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, the Bengal government, the Indian Oil, Purnendu Chatterjee, IDBI, Chatterjee Petrochem, Winstar India Investment Company and India Trade (Mauritius) Ltd among others.

 Since TCG moved the CLB in August 2005, contesting the allotment of shares to the Indian Oil, HPL has not called an annual general meeting.

 Annual reports were not published as the yearly account was not passed by the board.

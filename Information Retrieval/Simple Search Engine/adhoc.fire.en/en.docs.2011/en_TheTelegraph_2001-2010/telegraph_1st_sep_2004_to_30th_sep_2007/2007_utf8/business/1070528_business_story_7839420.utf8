 Bankers see fall in rates

 HOPE FOR THE BEST

 New Delhi, May 27: Bankers expect interest rates to fall by half a percentage point because of the downtrend in the inflation rate.

 Interest rates have reached a peak and will show signs of moderation in the next two to three months as the inflation rate is falling, Prakash P. Mallya, chairman-cum-managing director, Vijaya Bank, said. Mallya sees the rates to come down by 50 basis points.

 A similar view was expressed by the executive director of Punjab National Bank, K. Raghuraman. With inflation coming down, there will be pressure on banks to reduce the lending rates in the next two months, he said. 

 The inflation rate fell to 5.27 per cent for the week ended May 12 from 6.7 per cent a couple of months back. This was after the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India took fiscal and monetary measures to control prices. 

 The bankers said the rate cuts would benefit only new borrowers. If and when the interest rates come down, new borrowers and existing customers with loans linked to the prime lending rate of a bank will benefit, A. Subramanian, general manager, Oriental Bank of Commerce, said.

 Any downtrend in the rates will make personal and housing loans cheaper.

 The bankers said those who have taken loans at floating rates would benefit. 

 In a floating rate loan, the interest rate fluctuates according to changes in indicators such as the key lending rates of the RBI.

 The average PLR for PSU banks is 13-13.5 per cent. The private sector banks have a higher PLR of around 15 per cent. Housing loans carry an interest rate of around 9.5 per cent, while the rates on personal loans vary from 12.5 per cent to 15 per cent.

 Banking expert U.S. Bhargava said the summer months were the lean season for loans. A falling demand for the loans would ease the pressure on the lending rates. The RBI is unlikely to raise its key lending rates since the inflation is at an eight-month low. The aim of the central bank is to keep the inflation rate close to 5 per cent in this fiscal.

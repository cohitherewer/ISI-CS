The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Oil retailers turn restless

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Costly proposition

 New Delhi, May 25: Public sector oil companies have approached the petroleum ministry for a hike in petrol and diesel prices. The PSUs are losing Rs 4-5 per litre on these fuels because of a sharp rise in the global price of crude.

 The government, under fire from the Opposition for high inflation rate, is cautious about the proposal. 

 Senior officials feel the government may be forced to raise fuel prices, if crude continues to surge in the world markets.

 The inflation rate has softened recently. However, any hike in oil prices will raise the rate. This is because a higher price of diesel raises transportation costs which affect all commodities.

 The problem has become serious. The oil companies will have to declare their first quarter results in a few months from now. If the current trend continues, our profits will be wiped out, a senior Indian Oil official told The Telegraph. 

 However, any decision on prices will be taken after the Prime Minister consults the Left parties, which are opposed to such a move. 

 Crude oil prices have continued to rise during the first quarter of this fiscal to touch a nine-month high of $71 per barrel this week.

 Tension over the nuclear stand-off with Iran and civil strife in Nigeria have been cited as the main reasons for the recent spikes in crude oil prices but speculators appear to have played a large role as well. 

 Official figures show the average price of the Indian basket of crude is $65.5 per barrel for the current fiscal compared with $62.46 in the previous year. This is an increase of more than $3, and the gap appears to be increasing each week.

 The Indian basket comprises 60 per cent of the cheaper Gulf variety and 40 per cent of the more expensive sweet Brent crude. 

 The cheaper variety has more sulphur than the sweet crude and is also more difficult to process. 

 India imported 110.85 million tonnes of crude in 2006-07, 11.5 per cent higher than the 99.4 million tonnes purchased in 2005-06.

 Change in lending priority

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 30: Banks can now lend more to the housing sector with the RBI today raising the cap on home loans under priority sector to Rs 20 lakh from Rs 15 lakh earlier.

 Loans up to Rs 20 lakh to individuals for purchase or construction of a dwelling unit per family (excluding loans granted by banks to their own employees), will come under the priority sector category, the new RBI guidelines said.

 Besides, loans up to a certain limit for repair of houses will be treated as priority sector advances. 

 While the limit has been set at Rs 1 lakh for rural and semi-urban loans, it will be Rs 2 lakh in urban and metropolitan areas, the central bank said.

 The RBI, in its credit policy on April 24, had taken a compassionate view on housing loans and relaxed the provisioning norms for loans up to Rs 20 lakh.

 While maintaining the overall priority sector lending limit at 40 per cent, the RBI has increased the lending cap on educational loans to Rs 10 lakh for studies in India and Rs 20 lakh for abroad. 

 Earlier, the limits were Rs 7.5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh, respectively.

 The revised guidelines, which take effect immediately, exclude loans to software industry from priority sector lending. 

 Revising the eligibility criteria for priority lending, the RBI said: Only those sectors which are employment-intensive such as agriculture, and tiny and small enterprises, should be eligible for inclusion under the priority sector.

 The guidelines specified that NRI deposits will no longer be deducted for the computation of adjusted net bank credit for priority sector lending purpose.

 Investments made by banks in recapitalisation bonds floated by the government will not qualify for priority sector lending, the guidelines said.

 Fresh bank deposits with Nabard or Sidbi on account of non-achievement of priority sector targets will not be treated as priority sector advances, the central bank said.

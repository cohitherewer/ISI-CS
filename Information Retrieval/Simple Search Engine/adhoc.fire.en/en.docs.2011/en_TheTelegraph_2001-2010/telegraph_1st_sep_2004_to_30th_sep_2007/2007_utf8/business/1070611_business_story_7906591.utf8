 New Delhi, June 10 (pti): Developing countries, including India, mopped up around $333 billion last year from the global market and the pace is likely to intensify in the near future, a recent World Bank study said. This a three-fold jump from $88 billion in 2002. The money was raised mainly through syndicated bank loans and overseas bond issues.

 Private and state-owned corporations in developing countries have borrowed in international markets on an unprecedented scale in the past few years, the report said.

 Twenty middle-income countries accounted for most of the participation, with India, China, Brazil, Mexico and Russia grabbing the lions share.

 These countries accounted for 95 per cent of the bond issue, 85 per cent of the bank borrowing and 95 per cent of the equity offerings, the report said. The trend will gather pace in the medium term, subject to fluctuations in the business cycle and changes in global financial conditions, it added.

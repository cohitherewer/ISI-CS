 Mumbai, May 29: DLF Ltd, which is entering the capital market with the countrys largest IPO to raise up to Rs 9,625 crore, plans to invest Rs 3,500 crore in the next two years to purchase land and development rights.

 K.P. Singh promoted-DLF has fixed the price band for the IPO at between Rs 500 and Rs 550 per share. This will enable the real estate company to raise between Rs 8,750 crore and Rs 9,625 crore.

 Out of the net proceeds, DLF proposes to utilise Rs 3,500 crore to acquire land and development rights, Rs 3,493 crore to develop existing projects while the remaining amount will be used to prepay loans, vice-chairman Rajiv Singh said. 

 Nearly 75 per cent of our land reserves is in the National Capital Region (NCR) or metros and this high quality land bank gives us the edge over others, he said.

 DLF chairman K.P. Singh said, We intend to diversify into new businesses such as special economic zones, hospitality and infrastructure. With the inflow of the IPO money, DLF is poised for a big leap.

 Singh said DLF would be entering the insurance sector by the year-end. We have joined hands with Prudential of the US to tap the insurance sector by the end of this year, he said. The company proposes to issue 17.5 crore equity shares of Rs 2 each through the 100 per cent book-building process. The issue opens on June 11 and will constitute 10.26 per cent of the fully diluted post-issue capital of the company.

 Realty price

 Real estate prices are likely to remain stable at current levels, Rajiv Singh said. I dont see any price bubble in real estate and expect prices to remain steady at current levels, he said.

 However, there could be some upward or downward movement depending upon the land location, he said. 

 Company officials pointed to the strength in the market and maintained that there is no lull in demand. DLFs business is heavily dependent on the performance of the real estate sector, particularly in the regions where it operates.

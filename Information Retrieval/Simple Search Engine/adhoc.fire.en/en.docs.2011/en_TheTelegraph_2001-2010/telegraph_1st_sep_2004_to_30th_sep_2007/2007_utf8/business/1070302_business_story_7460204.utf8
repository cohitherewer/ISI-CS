 Calcutta, March 1: Bajaj Auto is set to invest Rs 300 crore to set up 55 retail Probiking showrooms by March 2008 across the country.

 It expects to sell 7,000 premium bikes per month next year, up 100 per cent from the sales of 3,500 per month now.

 These showrooms will cater to biking enthusiasts in the premium or performance segment.

 We are putting a lot of emphasis on the service quality. Of the Rs 300 crore earmarked for the stores, we will invest Rs 70 crore on the interiors. We have opened six shops in the country the sixth one being in Calcutta. Of the 55 shops, 13 would be company-owned and operated and the remaining outlets would be company-owned and dealer-operated, said K. Srinivas, vice-president (human resources) of Bajaj Auto, who heads this retail venture.

 These outlets have already been opened in Pune, Navi Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.

 These showrooms will focus on premium bikes of 150cc and above.

 The company is also going to launch Pulsar 220cc in the next four months. This model has already been soft launched in Pune.

 The Probiking showroom would also be the first in the country to introduce the technology of a static test drive through a dynamometer, which enables the consumer to even check on the mileage without going outside the showroom.

 Two years ago, this segment was not there in the country. Therefore, the projected growth is also rapid. We expect to sell 100 such bikes per month from Calcutta and another 50 per month from Siliguri, Srinivas added.

 However, the northeastern market sells around 300 bikes per month and is a much larger market than Bengal.

 Compared with the premium segment, which is growing speedily on a small base, the growth of the entry-level segment is 12 per cent, while the executive segment is experiencing a 20 per cent growth.

 Of the 2 lakh two-wheelers sold across all models by the company on a monthly basis, 50 per cent or a lakh is the Platina.

 The Pulsar 150cc sells around 30,000 to 35,000 per month.

 The company has also launched the 200cc Pulsar DTS-I in the city. The ex-showroom price of the model is Rs 66,745. 

 The new Pulsar has now raised the bar in the motorcycle industry by being the first bike in the country to have front and rear tubeless tyres and an electric start, Srinivas said.

 Bengal accounts for 10 per cent of the companys turnover. 

 Bajaj Auto has a market share of 36 per cent in the premium segment.

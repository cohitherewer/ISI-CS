 Medicine magic mesmerises McKinsey

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, Aug. 22: India will be one of the top-10 markets in pharmaceuticals by 2015, according to a report by global consulting firm McKinsey.

 The size of the domestic pharmaceuticals market is expected to triple to $20 billion by 2015, McKinsey said.

 In 2005, the size of the pharmaceuticals market was $6.3 billion and the country was 14th in the pecking order. The growth in India will be next only to the US and China.

 China had a market size of $13 billion in 2005, the ninth largest in the world. 

 It will become the worlds fifth largest market after the US, Japan, France and Germany, said the report titled India Pharma 2015: Unlocking the Potential of the Indian Pharmaceuticals Market. 

 According to the report, the factors that will drive the growth are increased affordability of medical care, an expansion in medical infrastructure, greater penetration of health insurance and adoption of patented products. The prevalence of chronic diseases and aggressive market penetration by smaller firms will also help in the growth of the sector.

 The doubling of disposable income and an increase in the number of middle-class households will account for 40 per cent of the projected growth. 

 The expansion of medical infrastructure, such as a rise in hospital beds to 37 lakh from 17 lakh in 2005, will make up for another 20 per cent of growth. 

 Greater penetration of health insurance will add 15 per cent and a gradual shift in disease profiles and adoption of patented products will support a growth of 10 per cent. Population growth will comprise the remaining 15 per cent.

 The report said therapy mixes would gradually move in favour of speciality and super-specialty therapies because of a rising incidence of lifestyle disorders. Mass therapies such as anti-infective and gastro-intestinal drugs will continue to comprise half of the market.

 Speciality therapies are those where products are prescribed by specialist and consulting physicians, while drugs for mass therapies are prescribed by general practitioners.

 The report forecast that generic drugs especially those that are not patented would continue to dominate. Patented products are likely to capture 10 per cent of the market and account for a share of around $2 billion. 

 Between 2010 and 2015, 40 new molecules will be launched globally every year and 75 per cent of these will be introduced in India within a year of their global launch. 

 Patent-related infrastructure are also likely to be in place by 2010. 

 Over the past five years, the relative performance of large, mid-sized and small domestic companies and multinational firms has changed, the report stated.

 Innovative sales and marketing models have helped mid-sized and small domestic companies outperform the market in terms of growth. 

 Large domestic companies have grown with the market. However, the multinationals lost some momentum during this period.

 Going forward, large domestic companies will face strong competition on both sides. Smaller players can maintain their trajectory if they continue to pioneer market creation, while multinational firms can gain a share through the launch of patented products depending on the level of regulatory and infrastructural support. 

 In such a competitive scenario, major domestic players will find it a challenge to maintain or improve their performance, the report said.

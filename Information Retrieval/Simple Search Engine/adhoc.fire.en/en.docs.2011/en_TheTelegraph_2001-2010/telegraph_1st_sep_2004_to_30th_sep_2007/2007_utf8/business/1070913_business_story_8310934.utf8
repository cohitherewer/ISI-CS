 Rupee ends on strong note

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 12: The rupee today ended at more than a one-month high of 40.45 against the dollar, a gain of nearly 12 paise over the previous close of 40. 57.

 A weak dollar in world markets and heavy capital inflows into the country were behind the rise in the rupee. An absence of demand for dollars from oil refiners aided the rise.

 Much of the gain was because of a weak dollar, globally. The US currency fell to an all-time low against the euro today on forecasts of a cut in US interest rates. Problems in the US credit market and a weak job outlook in the country added to dollar woes.

 These developments had an impact in India right from the start of trading. In fairly active trades, the rupee opened firm at 40.52 per dollar and moved towards a nine-year high. 

 Analysts expect the rupee to remain buoyant. Inflows from foreign institutional investors will be high because of the ongoing initial public offering of Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. Crude oil prices may be a worry, but as inflows are expected to be strong both from foreign direct investment and FIIs, the rupee is unlikely to lose ground, an analyst with a private sector bank said.

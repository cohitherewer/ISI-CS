 Paswan: Steely resolve

 New Delhi, Jan. 12: State-run Steel Authority of India Limited may invest over Rs 100,000 crore by 2020 to increase its capacity, more than the combined investment of global players such as Posco and Mittals in India. 

 Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the investments being planned would increase SAILs capacity to 40 million tonnes from 14 million tonnes. 

 The SAIL board has, so far, cleared investment proposals to take production capacity to 23 million tonnes at a cost of Rs 39,433 crore. 

 SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta said the company board has not yet cleared plans to expand capacity beyond this but as this was a directional plan they would work on the figures later.

 SAIL recently announced a record production of 3.318 million tonnes of saleable steel. It has also recorded its highest-ever sales of 3.014 million tonnes for the third quarter of the current financial year. 

 Compared with the same period last year, the company has registered a 6 per cent and 8 per cent growth in saleable steel production and sales respectively, during October-December 2006. 

 The record third-quarter sales took SAILs nine-month figures to 8.412 million tonnes, an increase of 13 per cent. 

 In the domestic market, the company sold 2.9 million tonnes of steel during the third quarter, an increase of 10.4 per cent.

 It also recently took up a Rs 9,600-crore modernisation and expansion programme of the Burnpur-based IISCO (now IISCO Steel Plant).

 The expansion of IISCO Steel Plant (ISP) is an integral part of SAILs growth plan to produce 23 million tonnes of hot metal by 2010.

 The modernisation programme will help ISP multiply its crude steel production capacity from the present 0.5 million tonnes to 2.5 million tonnes by 2010.

 In contrast, Korean steel maker Posco has planned a Rs 52,000-crore integrated steel plant to make 12 million tonnes of steel in Orissa. The Mittals have announced plans to invest up to Rs 40,000 crore in India.

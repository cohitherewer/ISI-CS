 Sakthi Auto buys unit of Intermet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, May 2: Coimbatore-based Sakthi Auto Components Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sakthi Sugars, has acquired an automobile components manufacturing plant of Intermet Europe for $130 million.

 Intermet Europe, a subsidiary of the US-based Intermet International Inc, manufactures precision castings for the automotive industry at this plant in Germany. 

 M. Manickam, vice-chairman of the Sakthi Group and chairman of Sakthi Auto Components, said the plant was purchased through an open auction bid.

 We won the bid and paid the full consideration and took over the plant (last) Friday, Manickam said from Saarbrucken in Germany, where the plant is located.

 Manickam said only the German plant of Intermet was up for sale. 

 Sakthi Auto Component operates two plants in India, producing ductile and grey precision castings, and the acquisition of the Intermet plant will strengthen its presence in the European market.

 The combined entity will be known as Sakthi Automotive Group and will be headquartered in Germany, he said.

 The acquisition will give the Sakthi group the benefit of a much higher technology in manufacturing and castings. The Asian market for automobile components is growing rapidly compared with the modest growth in Europe. As there is little overlap of our already existing products, it will bring synergies to our export markets as well, he said.

 We are pleased to find a partner in India. This will enable us to serve our customers in the fast-growing Asian markets as well as in Europe, Laurence Vince-Chatterton, chief executive of Sakthi Automotive Group, said. 

 In Europe, Intermet has TRW, Bosche and Continental as customers. 

 The new companys products would be marketed internationally under the Sakthi brand, Manickam added.

 Sakthi Sugars chairman N. Mahalingam said the growing automotive business of the group did not overshadow its sugar business. A sugar mill will be commissioned at Erode in Tamil Nadu soon, he added.

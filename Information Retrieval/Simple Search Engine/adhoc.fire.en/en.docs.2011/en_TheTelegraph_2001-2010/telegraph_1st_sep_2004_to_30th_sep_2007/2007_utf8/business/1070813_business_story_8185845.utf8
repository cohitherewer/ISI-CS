 SAIL bets big on Durgapur unit

 Roongta: Growth plans

 New Delhi, Aug. 12: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) is planning to invest Rs 5,549 crore to upgrade the facilities of Durgapur Steel Plant.

 SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta said the aim was to raise the share of finished products in the total output to 95 per cent from 45 per cent.

 Durgapur had for long been the production base for semis which others used to buy and add value. We now plan to change that story. Ninety five per cent of its production will be finished products, Roongta told The Telegraph. 

 This will not only add to the topline but also to the bottomline significantly, he added. 

 Durgapur Steel Plant makes 1.58mt of saleable steel, of which 8.61 lakh tonnes are semis that are sold to other steelmakers for rerolling into finished products.

 We want to reduce the output of semis even as we take our output to 2.83mt of saleable steel and 3.5mt of hot metal, the SAIL chief said. 

 Officials said value addition would increase Durgapur Steels profitability, which stood at Rs 244 crore in the first quarter of this financial year.

 The funds will be used to build a sinter plant, upgrade the first blast furnace and set up four bloom-cum-round casters.

 Also on the anvil are a medium structural mill, wire rod mill and a merchant mill. This will take the output of structurals to 1.25mt and merchant products to 1mt. 

 The capacity of the wheel and axle plant, which supplies to Indian Railways, will be raised to 2.5 lakh tonnes of wheels a year from 58,000 tonnes. Axles output will go up to 50,000 units a year. 

 Roongta said there were plans to modernise Alloy Steel Plant, which is also in Durgapur.

 The PSU plans to invest Rs 15,000-17,500 crore on expanding the capacities of its facilities in Bengal.

 Already the SAIL board has sanctioned projects worth Rs 10,330 crore for the state. The bulk of funds will go towards upgrading IISCO Steel Plant at Burnpur in the state, while Rs 738 crore has been allotted for a wire rod and bar mill at Durgapur Steel Plant.

 As part of the IISCO modernisation plan, SAIL would install a coke oven battery, two sinter machines and a blast furnace having a capacity of 4,600 cubic metres. The officials said there were also plans for three converters, two strand billet casters, a beam caster, a universal section mill and a 12mt wire rod and bar mill.

 SAIL had merged IISCO, which held rights for the Chiria iron ore mines, some time back to give the PSU an assured supply of ore.

 The Jharkhand government and SAIL have been engaged in a prolonged tussle over Chiria, with the state government saying it will only renew the leases to the extent of the PSUs requirements in the state and for IISCO. 

 The reserves are estimated to be 1.7-2 billion tonnes.

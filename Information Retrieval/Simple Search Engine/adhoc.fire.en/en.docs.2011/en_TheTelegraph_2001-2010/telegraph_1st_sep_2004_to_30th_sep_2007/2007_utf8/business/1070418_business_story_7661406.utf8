 Indian Oil to raise $200m

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AMP; S.P.S.PANNU

New Delhi, April 17: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) will tap the US private placement market to raise $200 million in foreign currency loans, with a green shoe option of $100 million. 

 IOC is entering the US market to diversify its borrowing base, according to banking sources. The funds will help in its expansion plans. 

 The company can raise loans at very low rates, in both the domestic and foreign markets, as it enjoys a high rating, which is close to Indias sovereign rating. 

 IOC chairman S. Behuria, director (finance) S.V. Narasimhan and other senior officials are in the US for presentations to bankers as part of the fund-raising exercise.

 IOC has signed deals with Citi Bank and Bank of America, which will help the company raise $200 million through private placement.

 The finance ministry has recently cautioned the public sector oil companies against any bulk offloading of its oil bonds. The ministry said the oil companies should not offload more than 25 per cent of the bonds held by them in any given quarter. 

 It had made an exception in the case of IOC and the company was hoping for a waiver again. The government, however, does not want the money market to be flooded with too many bonds at this stage and has hence asked IOC to go slow.

 A senior IOC executive told The Telegraph that the companys debt-equity ratio has improved to 0.75: 1 during 2006-07 from 0.9: 1 in 2005-06. He said the net borrowing of the company till December 31 was Rs 27,846 crore.

 As the government bonds issued to IOC as compensation for the under-recoveries in kerosene and LPG were released only towards the fag end of the financial year in 2004-05, the company had to take recourse to higher borrowings. 

 This year, the oil bonds have come through earlier. The refining margin worked out to $3.64 per barrel during 2006-07 compared with $5.16 per barrel in the preceding fiscal.

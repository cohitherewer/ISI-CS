 Assocham upbeat on tax mopup

 New Delhi, June 17 (PTI): Higher collection of corporate and service taxes would spur the growth of total tax revenue, The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) said today. It will grow to over Rs 5.8 crore by 2009-10 and Rs 10.7 crore by 2014-15 from Rs 4.6 crore in 2006-07, the chamber added.

 Growth in total tax collection will increase mainly on account of higher collection of corporate and service taxes and partly because of increase in income tax, customs and excise duty, the chamber said in its Eco Pulse Study on Tax Revenue: The Future Growth Path.

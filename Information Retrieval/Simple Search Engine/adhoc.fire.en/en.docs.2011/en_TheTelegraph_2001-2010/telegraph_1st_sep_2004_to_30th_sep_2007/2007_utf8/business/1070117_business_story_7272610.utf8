 Top-level reshuffle at Mastek

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 16: Mastek executive chairman Ashank Desai, who is back after a sabbatical of nearly nine months, will take on a non-executive role in the company. Sudhakar Ram, who was the acting chairman in Desais absence, has been appointed as the chairman and managing director of Mastek.

 Desai said, Ive had a wonderful experience in founding and growing Mastek along with Sundar, Ketan and Sudhakar for over two decades. We have come a long way as a company and as a team. As the company enters a new phase of growth, it is time to bring in the next generation of management talent. I will continue to be active on the board and be the chief ambassador of Mastek, representing the company in various industry and public forums. I have watched Sudhakar grow as a leader in the last five years and have full confidence in his ability to take the company to new heights, going forward.

 As chairman and managing director, Desai saw Mastek growing from a small domestic player with Rs 10 crore in revenues to a Rs 700-crore global solutions company, Ram said. 

 The company will now look both within and without to scale and leverage the enormous business opportunities ahead of us. I look forward to growing Mastek into a significant global solutions company in the next few years, he added. The company will seek necessary approvals to appoint Ram, who is a non-resident, as the chairman amp; managing director.

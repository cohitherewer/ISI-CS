 Tata Power rating may come down

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 9: Global rating agency Standard and Poors Ratings Services today placed Tata Power on credit watch with negative implications because of concerns on the companys debt and its exposure to project completion, stabilisation, and counterparty risks. 

 S amp;P now has a BB+ rating for Tata Power. In October 2006, S amp;P had revised the outlook on the company from stable to negative after it announced its Rs 2,200-crore investment outlay and its plans to proceed with the Rs 4,000-crore Maithon power project.

 In April, Tata Power announced the acquisition of Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd, a special purpose vehicle for the Mundra Power Project. Earlier this year, the company had acquired 30 per cent stakes in two Indonesian coal producers for about $1.1 billion. 

 The cash outlays associated with Tata Powers investment plans will lead to a significant rise in the companys debt, in comparison with its existing cash flows. This willresult in a possible lowering on its ratings, said S amp;P credit analyst Anshukant Taneja.

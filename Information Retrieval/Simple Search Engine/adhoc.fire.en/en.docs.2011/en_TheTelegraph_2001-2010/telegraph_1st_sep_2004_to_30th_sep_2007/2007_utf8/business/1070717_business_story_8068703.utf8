 TCS beats rupee rise to post 36% profit hike

 Mumbai, July 16: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the countrys largest exporter of software services, has reported a net profit of Rs 1,202.93 crore in the first quarter of 2007-2008 against Rs 882.66 crore a year ago, an increase of 36 per cent.

 The good show was a result of greater financial discipline and improved operational efficiencies. TCS braved rupee appreciation and a higher wage bill to rack up the strong numbers. Just last week, Infosys Technologies gave a lower guidance for the year because of the strong rupee. 

 Wage increases take effect in TCS and Infosys from the first quarter, while in Wipro and Satyam Computers the other two local software giants the increase usually applies from the third quarter. Infosys had declared a 35 per cent rise in net profit, beating analysts expectations. However, its guidance was a disappointment.

 Unlike Infosys, TCS does not give a guidance for a quarter or for the year. 

 Speaking to newspersons here today, S. Mahalingam, chief financial officer of TCS, said the appreciating rupee hit the companys margins by 2.58 per cent and wage inflation by 2.08 per cent. Volumes during the quarter, however, rose 7.6 per cent and pricing improved by 0.6 per cent. We were able to neutralise both (the rupee rise and wage hikes) through efficient financial management, Mahalingam said. 

 The company also benefited from the policy of hedging its overseas earnings. Its total outstanding hedged position is $2.5 billion. 

 Financial prudence along with a productivity improvement of 2.13 per cent have helped the company maintain its net margins at 22.8 per cent. Margins of Infosys took a 3.5 per cent hit because of rupee appreciation. 

 Wage increases had a 2.7 per cent impact, while higher visa costs dented its margins by another 1 per cent.

 N. Chandrasekaran, head of global sales and operations, said TCS was negotiating better terms with clients.

 There has been an average price increase of 3 to 5 per cent in contract renewals, while for new clients the company was looking at an increase of 5 per cent. On a consolidated basis, the company saw its income from operations grow 25 per cent to Rs 5,202.89 crore compared with Rs 4,154.85 crore in the same period last year. 

 TCS, the largest employer in the private sector with a staff of 95,000, recruited 8,706 people in the first quarter.

 The net addition is 5,512 employees, and the attrition rate of 11.5 per cent is the lowest in the industry.

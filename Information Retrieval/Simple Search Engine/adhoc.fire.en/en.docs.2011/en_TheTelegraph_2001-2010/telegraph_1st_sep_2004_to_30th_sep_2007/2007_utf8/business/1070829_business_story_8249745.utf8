 Deal tempo stays intact

 BOND WITH THE BEST

 Mumbai, Aug. 28: Indias Deal Street continues to buzz with no sign yet that the credit squeeze precipitated by the sub-prime mortgage woes in the US will force them to slam the brakes on buyouts.

 Private equity players have already committed their funds. The deployment of the funds has started. So, we should not see any effect (of the sub-prime crisis) now, said Sanjiv Kaul, managing director of ChrysCapital.

 Blackstone the other big investor among private equity funds sees things the same way. The company said their plans in India wont be affected by tight credit markets as most deals are small and not financed by debt.

 Akhil Gupta, chairman of Blackstone Advisors India Pvt, said in a recent interview that the firm expected to continue buying companies at the normal pace. The current global credit crunch is a unique situation, but deals in India arent going to be affected by that, he said.

 The past few months have seen a very high level of activity in the mergers and acquisitions market. The value of outbound deals acquisitions made by Indian companies abroad has jumped 182 per cent to over $28 billion from $9.9 billion in 2006 , says Grant Thornton, the global accounting, tax and business advisory organisations. 

 I dont think the sub-prime crisis will have any impact. Most private equity investors who have committed funds know that they cannot accelerate the pace of returns. It will be better for them to wait a while. At the same time, the cost of raising funds outside India may rise said Robin Roy, associate director of PricewaterhouseCoopers.

 However, some have sounded the alarm bells. Indian companies interested in buyouts were leveraging their positions a lot in the past. I dont see that happening in the future any more, said Rajeev Gupta of the Carlyle group.

 Reports indicate that several companies are now going easy on buyouts. After an aggressive acquisition spree last year, Ranbaxy has backed out of the race for the generic unit of Germanys Merck KGaA citing high valuations.

 momentum in education, agriculture and infrastructure has 

 to be sustained

 Fringe benefit and service tax for corporates; income-tax 

 slabs, capital gains tax and inflation from an individual 

 point of view

 Anything youd have liked the finance minister 

 to do and he did or didnt: All the above 

 have a bearing on our lives, whether professionals or individuals. 

 The gap between the two Indias urban and rural 

 has to be filled, not merely with the contribution of the 

 performing sectors but with government policies and operational 

 efficiency

 a meticulous saver nor a savvy investor like the 

 majority of the working class, I tread the middle path of

 Whats the Wow factor in the budget? If I 

 may use a cricketing term, the FM has played a defensive 

 shot! There's nothing much to be happy about but for the 

 concessions to senior citizens

 Whats the Ouch factor in the budget? The 

 government seems to have missed out on providing incentives

 has been completely ignored

 Anything youd have liked the finance minister 

 to do and he did or didnt:I hoped he would 

 do something for the film industry, he 

 didnt

 CYRUS SAHUKAR

 veejay

 Average annual income (say last five years): 

 Can't tell you that

 Average annual tax paid (say last five years): 

 Can't recall immediately

 Whats the Wow factor in the budget? 

 Nothing that I can think of

 Whats the Ouch factor in the budget? 

 There should have been more tax exemptions. Mumbai needs 

 a break from taxes because 40 per cent of the country's 

 total taxes comes from this city. But if you look at the 

 city, you will know that none of the money is being spent 

 here. The budget should have brought that to light. Where 

 did our money go? We would like it to be redirected to us

 Anything youd have liked the finance minister 

 to do and he did or didnt: The price of 

 fuel has to come down. Otherwise, we need cars that run 

 on air or go back to horses and carriages 

 Also, home loan rates shouldn't be called flat or fixed 

 any more. They should be called sinking rates they 

 shoot up dramatically and sink people

 Prefer to invest in: Mostly mutual funds, very 

 little in shares safe shares. But now I plan to dabble 

 in real estate. I plan to buy one brick and hope that the 

 money 

 doubles soon. By 2080, I will make a killing 

 Do you rely on professional advisers or decide yourself? 

 I have a professional adviser but I also know my stuff 

 Any business investments? No

 Any wild idea or place you simply would love to 

 invest in?Hollywood or an Irani cafe

 Advice for amateur investors: You should know the 

 stuff. Professional advisers talk really fast and keep nodding 

 their heads. If you say you don't understand, you'll be 

 taken to be dumb. So you must know a bit of your investment

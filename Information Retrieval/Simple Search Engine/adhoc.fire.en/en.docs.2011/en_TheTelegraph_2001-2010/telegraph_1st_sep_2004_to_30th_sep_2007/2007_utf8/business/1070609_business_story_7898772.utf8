 Phoenix Mills set for preferential share issue

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 8: Phoenix Mills, one of the first companies to unlock the value of its real estate in Mumbai, is making a preference issue of 23.85 lakh shares to a clutch of investors at a price of Rs 1,600 per share. 

 The price is at a discount of 12 per cent to the closing price of the company on the BSE today.

 The investors to whom shares will be allotted include HSBC Financial Services, Americorp Ventures Ltd, Barclays Mauritius Pvt Ltd, Citigroup Global Markets Mauritius Pvt Ltd and Rhodes Diversified. 

 Phoenix did not elaborate on what it plans to do with the Rs 382 crore that will be mobilised from the preferential issue. 

 The company today informed the stock exchanges that its board will meet on Saturday to consider and approve the allotment of equity shares at a price of Rs 1,600 apiece according to the consent of shareholders through a postal ballot.

 Phoenix Mills is also planning to raise Rs 1,000 crore from a qualified institutional placement. 

 Unconfirmed reports said the company is planning to set up a 300-room business hotel in Mumbai and has joined hands with Hong Kong- based Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts. Apart from a hotel, the complex will include a multiplex, which will be set up by PVR Ltd.

 In 1999, Phoenix provided the first instance of mill lands in Mumbai to be redeveloped into spanking new offices and recreational centres.

 Karnik: Thinking big

 New Delhi, July 12: The ITeS-BPO segment is likely to clock export revenues of $11 billion for 2007-08, Nasscom said here today.

 The ITeS-BPO segment recorded export revenues of $8.4 billion in 2006-07. We expect the segment to grow at around 30 per cent and to clock revenues of $11 billion this fiscal, said Kiran Karnik, president of the National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom).

 Nasscom ranked Genpact first and WNS Global Services second among the top 15 ITeS-BPO exporters for 2006-07.

 The rankings are based on companies reported revenue for the year.

 Transworks Information Services was ranked third followed by IBM-Daksh, TCS BPO, Wipro BPO at the fourth, fifth and sixth positions respectively.

 The sector grew 33.5 per cent last fiscal, contributing $8.4 billion to the total software and services exports of $31.4 billion.

 Karnik said the Indian BPO sector had undergone a significant transformation over the past decade. 

 Overseas M amp;As, along with an increase in scale and depth of existing service lines, have complemented the growth of this segment, he added. 

 The employee base also grew to 553,000 in fiscal 2007 from 415,000 in 2005-06. Steady growth has been observed in three key service categories, including finance, customer interaction services and human resource administration.

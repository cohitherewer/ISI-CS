 Broker stake sale 

 Mumbai, May 20 (PTI): A clutch of foreign retail brokerage firms is planning to enter the Indian market. They have been attracted by the growth achieved by Indian brokerages. 

 Foreign majors, such as the Citigroup, Societe Generale, BNP Paribas, Standard amp; Chartered Bank and Australia-based Macquarie Bank are planning to pick up stakes in Indian retail brokerages.

 A buoyant stock market despite the odd hiccup combined with an increasing appetite for equities among investors, convenient online trading and falling brokerage fees have proved to be major growth drivers of the industry.

 The potential of the Indian market was highlighted recently when nearly 19 suitors stepped forward to claim a stake in retail brokerage ShareKhan, which is amongst the top three such firms in the country.

 The Citigroup is understood to have emerged as the frontrunner for picking up a majority stake in ShareKhan, which analysts say can have a valuation of around Rs 650 crore.

 The winner will be announced on Monday after the companys board meet, said Shripal Morakhia, promoter of the company. The retail equity brokerage space has been an area of special focus for major players given the huge growth in the business in recent times and its future potential, said Alok Jain, a leading city broker.

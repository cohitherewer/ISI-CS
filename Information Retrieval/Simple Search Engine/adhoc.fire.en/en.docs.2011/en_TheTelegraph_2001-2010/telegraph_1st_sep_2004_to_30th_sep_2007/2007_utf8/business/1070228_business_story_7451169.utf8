 Stocks get the pre-budget jitters

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 27: You could call it pre-budget blues. But apprehensions that the Union Budget may contain some stern measures like reduction in customs duties or even a hike in capital gains tax saw the sensex shedding 170.69 points today. 

 The mood was further affected by Chinas main index dropping nearly 9 per cent, its biggest percentage fall in around 10 years. However, the focus continued to remain on Wednesdays budget session and the proposals which it may contain. Fearing that the finance minister may announce tough measures to control inflation, market participants were in sell mode in most of the counters. 

 Even as the Economic Survey highlighted rising prices as a matter of concern, the ruling party at the Centre suffered reverses in two states that went to the polls. Market circles said given such circumstances, investors refrained from picking up stocks even at low levels of the day. 

 All are waiting for the Union Budget. There are worries that the finance minister may bring down customs duties on many items to address the issue of inflation. There is also a worry in some quarters that the short-term capital gains tax may be hiked. However, things should be more clearer tomorrow, a broker pointed out. 

 Resuming firm at 13703.41, the sensex gradually moved downwards to the intra-day low of 13408.56 before ending the day at 13478.83, a net fall of 170.69 points or 1.25 per cent from last close of 13649.52. 

 Similarly, the broader S amp;P CNX Nifty of the National Stock Exchange also dipped by 48.10 points or 1.22 per cent to 3893.90 from the previous close of 3938.95. 

 As rising inflation continues to be a major source of worry, many banking stocks were aggressively sold.

 FIPB defers Hutch decision

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 On hold

 New Delhi, April 23: The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) today deferred a decision on Vodafones proposal to take control of Hutchison Essar for the third time.

 The FIPB would take up the issue again on April 27. The board is studying the deal to determine whether the transaction is compliant with the domestic foreign direct investment norms.

 Industry secretary Ajay Dua said the FIPB would study the observations of the law ministry before considering the issue again.

 Vodafone sought the government approval in February to complete the acquisition, which would give it a 52 per cent controlling stake in Hutch Essar for $11.1 billion.

 We have received the law ministrys response today in the meeting. It is a detailed response. We have to study it. The FIPB will meet again on Friday, said Dua.

 Even though various departments, including that of legal affairs and telecom, and the Reserve Bank gave a clean chit to the controversial shareholding structure in Hutch Essar, the FIPB is still deliberating whether the 15 per cent Indian holding violated the 74 per cent FDI norms.

 According to law ministry sources, the attorney-general has already given his views to the government, which absolves Hutch Essar from the alleged breach of FDI norms.

 The ministry has found Hutchison Telecommunication International Ltds disclosures of equity holdings in stock exchanges of India and Hong Kong to be different because of differences in the legal requirements of the two countries. According to the ministry, HTIL has met the legal requirements of both the countries.

 On the controversial shareholdings of Analjit Singh and Asim Ghosh, the ministry is believed to have said they could not be classified as benami. It has also upheld that Singh and Ghosh are independent and have voting rights.

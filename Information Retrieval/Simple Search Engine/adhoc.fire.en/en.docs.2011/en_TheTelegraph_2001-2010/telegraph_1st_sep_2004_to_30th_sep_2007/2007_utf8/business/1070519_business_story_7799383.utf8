 Merchant airports to meet traffic need

 New Delhi, May 18: The civil aviation ministry is giving finishing touches to a policy on merchant airports aimed at creating infrastructure to meet the demand of the fast growing air traffic. These airports will be built and run by private players without government funding.

 The government has already held a meeting to gauge the interest of the private sector. A policy initiative in this regard is likely to be finalised shortly. 

 The meeting, convened by civil aviation secretary Ashok Chawla on Wednesday, was attended by representatives of industry chambers, airport operators, consulting companies, regulatory bodies and infrastructure companies.

 It is understood that 100 per cent FDI will be allowed in these airports, though the government is yet to take a decision on whether foreign airlines or airport operators will be allowed to participate.

 Merchant airports have been conceptualised as those which are entirely created by the private parties with their own resources, without any government funding. 

 These airports would, however, function subject to safety and security oversight of the government.

 The participants at the meeting felt that while there were no set international practices which could be used as benchmark for the merchant airports, such facilities were required given the massive growth in the air traffic, said a ministry official, who did not wish to be named.

 Such airports are expected to come up in areas of high population density and more air traffic, they said.

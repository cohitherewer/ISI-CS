 Hindalco to buy out Alcan in Utkal unit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 18: Hindalco Industries, part of the AV Birla group, is acquiring the 45 per cent stake held by Canada-based Alcan in the Utkal Alumina project in Orissa for an undisclosed sum.

 Hindalco today said the transaction would close in the next 30 days and mark the complete exit of Alcan from the Utkal project. 

 Alcan will have no surviving rights or obligations, as Hindalco becomes the 100 per cent owner of the Utkal project. 

 The company said it would continue to have a cordial business association with Alcan, which had ongoing contracts with Novelis, the Canadian firm that was acquired by Hindalco earlier. 

 It is also the technology provider to the Utkal alumina project and some other projects of Hindalco.

 Utkal was established in 1992 as a joint venture between Hindalco, Alcan and Hydro Norsk. 

 Alcan held 35 per cent while Norsk Hydro owned 45 per cent. 

 Norsk Hydro later sold its stake to the two partners. 

 However, local residents have opposed construction at the site on the grounds that it would displace several families. 

 The project includes the development of a bauxite mine and a refinery to produce one million tonnes of alumina annually.

 Alcan is pleased to have reached this agreement with Hindalco regarding the sale of its participating interest in Utkal, said Jacynthe Cote, president and chief executive officer of Alcan Bauxite and Alumina.

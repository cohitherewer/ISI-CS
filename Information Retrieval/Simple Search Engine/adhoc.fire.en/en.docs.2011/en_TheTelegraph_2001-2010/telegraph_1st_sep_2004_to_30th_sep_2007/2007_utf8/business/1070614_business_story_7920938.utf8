 New Delhi, June 13: Commerce minister Kamal Nath today announced a bailout package for exporters hit by the rising rupee.

 Nath has recommended to the finance ministry a 5 per cent increase in the duty entitlement pass book and duty drawback rates.

 He has also recommended slashing interest rates on pre-shipment and post-shipment credit to 6 per cent. The rates now range from 9 to 11 per cent. The minister also wants the exchange earners foreign currency accounts to be made interest bearing. The interest on these accounts was discontinued since 2000. Moreover, commercial banks may be mandated to meet their 15 per cent credit disbursement target.

 The service tax exemption and refunds announced in the Foreign Trade Policy 2007 should be notified without further delay.

 All arrears of terminal excise duty and central sales tax reimbursement will be cleared by June 30. The Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) will reduce its premium rates by up to 10 per cent, Nath said after meeting export promotion organisations. This decision on ECGC will be implemented immediately. ECGC, which provides risk cover to exporters, is a public sector entity under the commerce ministry.

 The minister drew up the package after interacting with a high-level delegation of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (Fieo) and all export promotion councils. The team was led by Fieo president G.K. Gupta.

 A committee is also being set up to assess job losses because of the appreciation of the rupee and the loss of export orders, Nath said. He, however, asked exporters to look at the rise in the rupee as an opportunity to increase their competitiveness and explore new markets.

 The minister said, The rupee rise is no doubt a problem, but it is also an opportunity for all of you to move towards greater efficiency, reducing costs and enhancing competitiveness.

 Calcutta, July 13: The Tatas are keeping a close watch on ArcelorMittals move to forge a global alliance with Nippon Steel Corporation.

 Not without reason: group company Tata Steel is also in talks with the worlds second largest player to set up a steel plant in India that will cater to the automobile sector.

 The MoU between Nippon Steel and ArcelorMittal talks about a collaboration in North America for the auto sector. The two companies are silent on whether the alliance will extend to auto steel sheets for the European and Asian markets.

 ArcelorMittal plans to build a greenfield plant in India where demand for steel sheet for auto sector is rising.

 Toyota, Honda and Suzuki, the Japanese carmakers, are customers of Nippon Steel and are looking to expand their operations in India as well.

 When asked how the deal would affect Tata Steels own project, T. Mukherjee, deputy managing director (steel) of Tata Steel, said it was too early to comment.

 There are two partners in this venture: Tata Steel and Nippon Steel. So I cannot say how it will work. We will have to talk to them. We have to know what they want, Mukherjee said on the sidelines of the annual general meeting of Tata Metaliks in Calcutta today.

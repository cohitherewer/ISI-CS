 New Delhi, Aug. 1: State-run banks will take a hard look at the possibility of reducing interest rates once the inflation rate stabilises at the level of 4-4.5 per cent.

 At a meeting with bank chiefs, finance minister P. Chidambaram enquired into the possibility of nudging down interest rates once inflation stabilises.

 Banks may lower deposit rates of one year maturity by 0.5 per cent... Some banks have already done that and interest rates have come down to 8.5 per cent. My impression is that it will stabilise at that level, Chidambaram said after his interaction with top officials of state-run banks here.

 To put a lid on inflation, the RBI yesterday raised the cash reserve ratio, or the amount of cash banks compulsorily keep with the central bank. 

 RBI governor Y. V. Reddy, while announcing the credit policy yesterday, said the risk of inflation remained because of rising oil and commodity prices in the global markets as well as excess money with commercial banks.

 The hike in the cash reserve ratio to 7 per cent is not expected to hit interest rates but will be a disincentive to a future reduction in rates.

 This is because net interest income of banks will be hit by the diversion of bank money to deposits with the RBI that fetch no return.

 Chidambaram said, The RBI is concerned with excess liquidity there is a certain excess liquidity in the system and that is why it has increased the cash reserve ratio. 

 Minority loans

 Chidambaram also told bankers that they should raise the target for lending to minorities. 

 The government has identified around 121 districts with significant minority concentration where banks have been asked to take a greater exposure.

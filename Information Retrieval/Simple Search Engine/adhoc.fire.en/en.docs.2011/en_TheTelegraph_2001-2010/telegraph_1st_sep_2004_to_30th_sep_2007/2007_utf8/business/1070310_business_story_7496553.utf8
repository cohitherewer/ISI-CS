 Bill prop for banks in SEZs 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 9: The government today introduced the Banking Regulation (amendment) Bill, 2007, that gives the RBI the freedom to reduce the SLR to any level it deems fit for banks and financial institutions in special economic zones (SEZs). 

 This will allow offshore banking in SEZs to function with greater ease. 

 At present, the RBI can keep between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of bank deposits as SLR. By doing away with the SLR floor level for banks operating in SEZs, the RBI will effectively allow offshore banking in these zones. 

 The bill also seeks to amend Section 53 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. Changes proposed in Section 53 of the act will make it mandatory to present draft notification before both houses of Parliament in cases of exemptions being granted to institutions, banks or branches located in special economic zones (SEZs).

 Though the governments SEZ policy has been under attack from various quarters, it has made it clear that it is willing to modify the policy but not give it up altogether. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram who introduced the bill in the lower house, said it was necessary that the RBI, as the regulator and the authority vested with the powers to conduct monetary policy, has the necessary flexibility regarding stipulation of holding of liquid instruments by banks.

 CST phase-out

 Chidambaram also brought the much awaited bill for phasing out central sales tax (CST) in three years to facilitate imposition of a new goods and services tax (GST) from April 1, 2010. 

 The Taxation Laws (amendment) Bill, 2007 has prepared a four-stage roadmap to phase out CST. The tax, which stands at 4 per cent, will be reduced to 3 per cent from April 1, 2007. In the following year, it will be brought down to 2 per cent and in April 1 2009, it will be reduced to 1 per cent.

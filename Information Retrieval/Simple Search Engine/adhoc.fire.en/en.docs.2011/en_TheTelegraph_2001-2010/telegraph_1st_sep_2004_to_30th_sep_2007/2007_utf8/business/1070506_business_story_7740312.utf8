 Calcutta, May 5: Allahabad Bank has posted a 14.29 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 750.14 crore for 2006-07 compared with Rs 656.34 crore in the previous year. 

 However, higher provisioning affected the banks profitability in the last quarter of 2006-07. Net profit dipped to Rs 125.74 crore from Rs 150.50 crore in the year-ago period. 

 We had provisioned Rs 200 crore in the fourth quarter of 2006-07 compared with Rs 183 crore in the same period a year ago, said A.C. Mahajan, chairman and managing director of Allahabad Bank. 

 Allahabad Banks operating profit in the last quarter of 2006-07 was lower at Rs 323 crore against Rs 330 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal, Mahajan added.

 The banks net non-performing assets rose to 1.07 per cent from 0.87 per cent at the end of March 2006. This is because we had to classify a number of small loans as bad loans during the year, Mahajan said. 

 The government came out with a special scheme in 2004 for a one-time settlement of sub-standard and bad loans. The offer period under the scheme ended in March 2006. So, we had to classify whatever bad loans remained unsettled till March 2006 as non-performing assets and make suitable provisions for them, he said. 

 The banks total business in 2006-07 went up 29.14 per cent to Rs 1,01,458 crore. Deposits grew to Rs 59,544 crore from Rs 48,500 crore and advances increased to Rs 41,914 crore from Rs 30,061 crore. Its capital adequacy ratio stood at 12.52 per cent against the statutory requirement of 9 per cent.

 The bank has set a target of 25 per cent growth in advances for the current fiscal.

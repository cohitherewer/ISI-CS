 Seven in pension race

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 25: Seven government entities have submitted preliminary bids to manage the nearly Rs 1,700 crore pension funds of government staff under the new scheme that requires matching contribution from the employee and employer.

 Bids have been placed by Punjab National Bank, the State Bank of India, UTI Asset Management, Canara Bank, IDBI Capital, the LIC and the Securities Trading Corporation of India. The eligible companies will be selected next week. They will give the financial details of their proposals, and by the middle of July, the pension regulator will appoint two to three fund managers. This is a big leap forward, said D. Swarup, chairman of the Pension Funds Regulatory Development Authority.

 Today was the last date for submission of bids and only financial service providers in which the government has at least 51 per cent share and manage assets worth Rs 10,000 crore were eligible to submit expressions of interest. 

 Central government employees who have joined after 2004 will be covered under the scheme. The government has allowed foreign direct investment up to 26 per cent in these entities. There is a provision in the scheme that allows for investment of a small fraction in equities.

 The regulator has appointed National Securities Depository Ltd as the central record keeping agency. The NSDL is creating the IT applications to be used in the scheme. 

 The size of the corpus is now Rs 1,600 crore. There are about five lakh employees in the scheme.

 Most states have switched over to the scheme. Those still to join are Bengal, Tripura and Kerala all run by the Left and some states in the Northeast.

 The defence forces are not part of the scheme.

 New Delhi, May 16: Newly appointed communication and IT minister A. Raja today said he would consider slashing domestic roaming charges and work to improve rural telephone services.

 My priority will be rural telephony... to provide facilities to common people, said Raja.

 The minister, who joined office today replacing Dayanidhi Maran, said his predecessors promised policy of zero-cost roaming would be looked into. 

 Maran, who resigned as communications minister on May 13 because of differences within his party, had planned to abolish nationwide roaming charges on wireless services in the next three months. 

 Officials said Rajas focus would be on rural networks. The government has set a target of 500 million cellular connections by 2010, a fifth of these in rural areas. 

 Raja is likely to encourage private players with sops to enter rural telephony in a bigger way. Private players have so far avoided rural areas as these were high-cost, but low- yield markets. 

 Ministry officials said the government had awarded contracts for setting up 8,000 towers in rural areas. This will provide 50 million connections in villages.

 Officials said pre-paid connections, driven by low tariff and increasing affordability of handsets, will boost the growth in rural telephony. 

 New measures to attract overseas investment into the telecom and IT sectors will be considered. Around six million mobile connections are being added every month.

 The telecom sector has attracted investment proposals worth Rs 51,600 crore from companies such as IBM, Microsoft and Nokia during Marans three-year stint as communications minister.

 Raja said he would give a final shape to Marans schemes and policies, which are in the pipeline, after discussing them with his officials.

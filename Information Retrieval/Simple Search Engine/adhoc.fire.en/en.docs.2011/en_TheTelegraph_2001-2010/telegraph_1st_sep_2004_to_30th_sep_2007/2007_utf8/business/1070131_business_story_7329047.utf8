 Playstation punch hits Sony hard

 Tokyo, Jan. 30 (Reuters): Sony Corp posted a 15 per cent fall in quarterly operating profit on Tuesday after massive losses at its game unit offset robust sales of flat TVs. The company, however, raised its annual outlook closer to market expectations.

 Sony, which competes with Samsung Electronics and Sharp Corp in the $63-billion liquid crystal display (LCD) TV market, enjoyed brisk demand for its Bravia flat panel televisions as well as for Cyber-shot digital cameras and Handycam camcorders.

 But gains in its electronics division were cancelled out by hefty losses at its game unit, which was weighed down by heavy start-up costs for its new PlayStation 3 (PS3) game console and sluggish demand for PlayStation Portable (PSP) handheld gear.

 Its a positive development that the company increased profits on electronics even as their prices fell during the holiday sales period, said Mizuho Investors Securities analyst Mitsuhiro Osawa.

 Of course we cannot ignore the game machines ... Its too early to say Sony has been reborn, Osawa added. Sony raised its operating profit forecast to 60 billion yen ($493.2 million) from 50 billion yen for the full year to March, still short of a consensus of a 69.2-billion-yen profit in a poll of 21 analysts by Reuters Estimates.

 The latest forecast compares with a 226.42-billion-yen profit last year. Its annual net profit forecast was raised to 110 billion yen from 80 billion yen. That would still be down from a 168.9 billion yen profit a year ago. Besides losses related to the PS3, which went on sale in November to compete head on with Microsofts Xbox 360 and Nintendo Co Ltds Wii, recalls of 9.6 million Sony-made PC batteries hurt its full-year profits.

 For October-December, operating profit came to 178.91 billion yen, down from 210.35 billion yen a year earlier. Sales rose 9.8 per cent to 2.61 trillion yen, and net profit fell 5.3 per cent to 159.92 billion yen.

 The sharp profit slide in the just-ended quarter was expected as the Tokyo-based company had said losses at its game unit would balloon to about 200 billion yen for the year to March.

 The Blu-ray high-definition optical disc drive and other cutting-edge technology used in the PS3 drove up production costs of the game machine, making some analysts feel it could be hurting Sonys bottomline for years to come.

 Shares of Sony closed down 1.8 per cent at 5,630 yen prior to the announcement, underperforming the Tokyo stock markets electrical machinery index, which fell 0.7 per cent.

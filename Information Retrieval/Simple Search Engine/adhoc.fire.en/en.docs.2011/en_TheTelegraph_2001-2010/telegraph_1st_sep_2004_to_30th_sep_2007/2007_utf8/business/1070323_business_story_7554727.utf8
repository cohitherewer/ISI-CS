The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Stage set for 74% FDI in telecom

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Das Munshi: Say cheers

 New Delhi, March 22: The Union cabinet today cleared the way for raising the FDI ceiling in telecom to 74 per cent from the current level of 49 per cent by amending Press Note 5 of 2005. Certain riders in Press Note 5 of 2005 had been holding back the implementation of higher FDI and their removal is now expected to bolster investment in the fast-growing telecom sector.

 The cabinet clearance followed after the department of telecom and security agencies reached a consensus on allowing remote access with certain safeguards. The changes in Press Note 5 of 2005 were delayed due to stiff opposition from the home ministry. 

 The remote access to networks in India has been given only from approved locations to equipment suppliers, manufacturers and affiliates, said Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, union minister of information and broadcasting.

 It will not be used for monitoring of content and its mirror image information will be made available online in India to security agencies. A complete audit trail of remote access activities would be maintained for six months. These changes will help in implementation of FDI policy notified in November 2005, the government said in a statement.

 However, the cabinet agreed to revise the conditions for enhancement of FDI ceiling only after consultations with the industry and persuasion by communications minister Dayanidhi Maran.

 In December last year, the cabinet had extended the deadline for telecom operators to comply with the norms for an increased foreign direct investment limit of 74 per cent. The current deadline expires on April 2.

 In February last year, the cabinet had approved the long-awaited proposal to hike the FDI ceiling. This was subject to certain conditions and clauses inserted by the home ministry to safeguard the nations interest by way of ensuring the Indianness of the operating companies.

 Infrastructure

 In a move aimed at expediting clearances, the government today approved changes in the procedures for allowing public-private partnerships in infrastructure projects.

 The capital cost of any public-private partnership appraisal committee project has been increased to Rs 250 crore from the existing Rs 100 crore, finance minister P. Chidambaram told reporters after a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.

 Calcutta, July 14: Allahabad Bank today launched doorstep services for all its customers, including retail depositors. 

 Initially, the doorstep banking service will be offered in branches offering core banking solutions. 

 Core banking solution (CBS) is networking of branches, which enables customers to operate their accounts from any branch of the bank on the CBS network.

 Individual customers having an average half-yearly balance of Rs 25,000 in a savings account or Rs 50,000 in a current account wont have to pay any service charge for this facility up to twice a month. 

 Customers with a lower savings bank or current account deposit will have to pay a service charge of Rs 50 per visit plus out-of-pocket expenses, if any.

 The bank has 24 CBS branches and it plans to add 100 more by March next year.

 Allahabad Bank has also launched a reverse mortgage scheme in the four metros. Under the scheme, we are charging a fixed interest rate of 11 per cent, which is renewable after every three years, said A.C. Mahajan, chairman and managing director of Allahabad Bank. 

 The bank will lend up to 60 per cent of the value of the property. The mortgaged property will be revalued once in every three years. 

 The bank has also reduced its interest rates on deposits in different maturity schemes by 50 basis points, effective from July 16. 

 Allahabad Bank today reported a 56.25 per cent jump in net profit for the first quarter of the current financial year at Rs 200 crore against Rs 128.25 crore in the previous corresponding year. The banks total business increased to Rs 1,03,379 crore for the quarter.

 Court refuses to stop HPL board meet

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 19: Calcutta High Court today refused to pass injunctions to stop the crucial board meeting of Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL) tomorrow.

 The court also declined injunction on the re-appointment of Swapan Bhowmik, managing director of HPL. 

 The Chatterjee Group (TCG) today moved an application, seeking injunction on the board meeting and appointment of managing director.

 But Justice Jayanta Biswas turned down the plea of TCG and allowed the meeting to take place. 

 It also refused to block Bhomiks appointment, if the board agrees to do so. 

 However, the appointment will be subject to the final order of the court. The matter will come up for hearing on April 2.

 The managing directors present term is coming to an end on March 31. 

 The board is meeting in Delhi at a time when two principal shareholders are fighting a legal battle in the court.

 TCG had opposed the appointment of Bhowmik at the Company Law Board too. But CLB did not entertain TCGs argument and declined to interfere with his appointment.

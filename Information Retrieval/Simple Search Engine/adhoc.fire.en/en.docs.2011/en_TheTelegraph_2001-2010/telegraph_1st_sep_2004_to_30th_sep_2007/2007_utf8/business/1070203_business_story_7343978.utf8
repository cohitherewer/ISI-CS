 FDI rule review underway

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: The government will sit in judgement over a clutch of proposals to finetune the caps on foreign direct investment in a wide range of sectors from cargo, ground handling, helicopters to retail, petroleum and commodity exchanges. 

 But the exercise is likely to take time and a clearer picture would emerge only after the budget, officials said. 

 In aviation, top officials said the government would look to raising the FDI cap in segments such as ground handling, aircraft maintenance, cargo, helicopter service and seaplane service.

 The government is exploring the possibility of raising the FDI cap, which is 49 per cent for most of the segments in aviation. Since there are security concerns, stringent safety clauses are likely, if the caps are raised. 

 In commodity exchanges, the move to hike FDI is likely to be based on the norms for stock exchanges a 49 per cent cap along with a clause restricting the holding of a single foreign investor, FDI or FII, to 5 per cent.

 The government will also decide on FII participation in commodity trading. Political parties and farmer groups oppose the entry of FIIs as they fear a repeat of last years rise in commodity prices. 

 Officials said the government would proceed with abundant caution in preparing the policy. Initially, participation of mutual funds and FIIs will be restricted to bullion, metals and crude. If this is successful, FIIs will be allowed in farm commodities. 

 In retail, where MNCs are coming in the back-end of the supply chain, a cabinet note is likely if the government thrashes out its differences with the Left.

 There are also proposals to liberalise FDI in asset reconstruction companies, which needs the approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board and has a cap of 49 per cent. Similarly, the cap on voting rights in the banking sector may also be reviewed, though progress is unlikely given the Lefts determination to oppose liberalisation in the sector.

 In petroleum, under review is the dilution of the condition to divest 26 per cent of the equity to Indian entities in five years. At present, FDI up to 100 per cent is permitted in both upstream and downstream sectors in oil.

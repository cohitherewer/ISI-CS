 Temasek sounds Nasdaq on LSE stake

 NEW DEVELOPMENT

 London, Aug. 26 (Reuters): Singapores state-owned Temasek Holdings has approached Nasdaq to buy its 30 per cent stake in the London Stock Exchange, a newspaper reported on Sunday.

 The Sunday Times said in an unsourced report that Temasek made the approach in recent days and the deal could lead to a full takeover of the LSE by the Singaporean investor.

 On August 20, the Nasdaq Stock Market said it might sell its stake in the LSE, worth 800 million ($1.6 billion), to bolster its chances of buying Nordic exchange operator OMX and it was already in touch with interested parties.

 The US exchange company said later in the day that it would not sell its LSE stake to a single buyer.

 The reported interest by Temasek, which owns stakes in UK banks Barclays and Standard Chartered, comes amid growing protectionism in Europe and the US towards sovereign wealth funds making aggressive overseas investments in search of higher returns.

 The International Monetary Fund said in June it was uneasy about the trillions of dollars managed by largely secretive sovereign wealth funds because it fears their activities could disrupt financial markets.

 Government-owned investment vehicles such as Temasek and its sister agency, the Government of Singapore Investment Corp, control about $2 trillion roughly the size of Frances economy and are expected to grow to $12 trillion by 2015.

 The newspaper said several parties, including the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, may enter the fray as well as investment and infrastructure funds, while the Observer newspaper said Nasdaq was seeking to sell up to half of its LSE stake to Deutsche Boerse.

 Temasek and Nasdaq were not immediately available for comment, while Deutsche Boerse declined to comment.

 Nasdaq, eager to expand its presence in overseas markets, is locked in a $4-billion bidding war with Borse Dubai for OMX, which owns exchanges in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and the Baltic states.

 Rio Tinto soars on BHP Billiton bid talk

 RAISE A STORM

 Sydney, May 9 (Reuters): Shares in mining group Rio Tinto surged on Wednesday on talk that bigger rival BHP Billiton was planning a bid which would create the worlds fifth biggest company, although Rio denied it had been approached.

 Talk swept Australian markets that BHP was readying a hostile bid for Rio after it had rebuffed a friendly offer of A$100-A$110 per share, a premium of up to 23 per cent from Tuesdays close, traders and analysts said.

 But Rio later issued a statement denying there had been an offer. Rio Tinto is not aware of any takeover approach from BHP Billiton, it said in a statement. BHP declined to comment.

 During early trade in London, Rio shares were up 5.2 per cent at 3,501 pence, after hitting a record high of A$99.69 in Sydney and closing there up 6.5 per cent at A$95.50.

 BHP shares were up 2.2 per cent at 1,211 pence, having hit a record high of A$32.58 in Sydney and closing up 2.4 percent at A$31.93.

 The DJ Stoxx European mining sector index was up 1.7 per cent.

 Based on the Sydney closes and latest London prices, the combined market value of BHP and Rio is about $250 billion, which would make it the worlds fifth largest company behind Exxon, General Electric, Microsoft and Citigroup.

 Combining the two groups would result in significant balance sheet and head office cost savings as well as greater purchasing power, Numis Securities analyst John Meyer said in a note, adding he would expect significant regulatory opposition.

 A combined group might see savings in the order of the $1 billion indicated in the Alcoa offer for Alcan, he said.

 The mining and metals sector has profited handsomely from a prolonged boom in mineral commodity prices after years in the investment backwaters and consolidation activity has been rife.

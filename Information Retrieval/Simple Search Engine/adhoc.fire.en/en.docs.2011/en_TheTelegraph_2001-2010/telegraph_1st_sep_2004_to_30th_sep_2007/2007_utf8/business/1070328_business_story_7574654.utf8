 New Delhi, March 27: JK Paper plans to invest Rs 700 crore to expand the capacity of its plants from 1.8 lakh tonnes per annum to 3.3 lakh tonnes per annum.

 JK sees a huge demand for writing and printing paper, fuelled by increased government outlay for education. The capacity expansion will be in the writing and printing paper segment.An expanding market and increased demand, driven by greater focus on education, has prompted us to expand in the writing and printing segment, managing director Harsh Pati Singhania said.

 The 130-year old domestic paper industry needs to expand its capacity from about 65 lakh tonnes to at least 100 lakh tonnes by 2010, said Singhania, adding that demand for paper and boards is expected to grow at around 8 per cent per annum by 2010.

 This high growth is led by consumption shift to value-added papers, said Singhania. The countrys leading paper manufacturer is conducting feasibility tests to install a 1 lakh-tonne-per-annum pulp and paper plant. 

 The new capacity would be added to the companys existing paper units either at Rayagada (Orissa) or at Sonagadh (Gujarat).

 With this new investment and growth plans, it is expected that by June-July 2008, JK Paper would become a Rs 1,000-crore plus company, said Singhania.

 The company will start production of multi-layered packaging boards at its Central Pulp Mills, Songadh, from next month. We are all set to start the production of multi-layered packaging boards from April, said Singhania.

 The company will produce around 60,000 tonnes per annum of multi-layered packaging boards, for which it has invested around Rs 300 crore.

 Multi-layered packaging and coated paper are witnessing a higher-than-average growth. In the multi-layered packaging segment, ITC is the single largest player.

 With the growing demand in this segment, the company hopes to quickly establish its presence in the market. The domestic retail boom will help drive demand for better quality packaging material, said Singhania. 

 JK Paper registered an all-time high turnover of around Rs 844 crore in 2005-06 against Rs 729 crore in the corresponding period previous year. 

 Singhania said the improved performance was a result of significant growth in branded copier and coated paper. Sales of copier paper grew 39 per cent year-on-year and high-end coated paper was up 62 per cent, he added.

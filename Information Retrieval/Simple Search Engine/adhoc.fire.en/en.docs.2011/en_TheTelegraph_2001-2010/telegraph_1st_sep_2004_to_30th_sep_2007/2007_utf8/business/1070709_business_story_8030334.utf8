 Engineering exporters cool to relief plan 

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, July 8: Engineering exporters are not expecting much from the Centres relief package to be announced on July 10. They see exports rising only 2 per cent because of the sops.

 According to the Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC), the export quantum this year would just about match last years target if the dollar hovers around Rs 40.

 Our export target last year was $24 billion, we touched $26 billion. But with the rupees appreciation, we will not be able to achieve the projected 20 per cent growth rate, said Rakesh Shah, chairman of EEPC.

 Engineering exports are projected to reach $100 billion by 2015. Finance minister P. Chidambaram and RBI governor Y.V. Reddy will hold a meeting to clear this relief package for exporters.

 The rupee has appreciated 12 per cent since March and not only lifestyle and textile exporters but engineering exporters also would have to struggle to maintain last years target. Textile exporters are set to take a hit of 8 to 10 per cent on their profit margins.

 The package is likely to convert an exchange earners foreign currency accounts to an interest-bearing instrument, reduce interest rates on packing credits and allow a 10 per cent drop in the export credit guarantee corporation premium.

 These do not make much of a difference to engineering exporters, Shah said.

 The commerce ministry wants to increase the popular duty reimbursement rates by 5 per cent, but the finance ministry may want to increase the rate for DEPB and drawback schemes by a slight margin, Shah said.

 Kamal Naths package includes an increase in drawback and DEPB rates by 5 per cent to neutralise local duties and state levies that are currently not refunded. 

 Shah said exporters with revenues of up to Rs 10 crore had complaints about the availability of timely credit. In certain cases, credit was granted after 21 days.

 According to complaints with the EEPC, most financial institutions do not follow the special directive issued for SMEs and exporters. Credit lending to exporters last year was 8 per cent against the stipulated 15 per cent.

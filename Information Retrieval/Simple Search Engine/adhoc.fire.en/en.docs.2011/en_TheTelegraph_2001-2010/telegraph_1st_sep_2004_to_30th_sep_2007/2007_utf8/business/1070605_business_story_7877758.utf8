 New Delhi, June 4: ONGC and Brazils Petrobras have signed a deal that gives the oil giants stakes in each others exploration blocks. 

 The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation has offered Petrobras a 15-40 per cent stake in its three deepwater blocks in Mahanadi, Krishna Godavari and Cauvery basins off Indias east coast. Petrobras has offered a 25-30 per cent stake to ONGC in three blocks in Barrierinhas, Sergipe-Alagoas, and Santos basins off the east coast of Brazil.

 The deal will lead to ONGC Videshs increased presence in Brazil and the entry of Petrobras into India. 

 At a later date, Petrobras may increase its stake in the ONGC blocks depending on the success and need, said Demarco Epifanio, Petrobras Europes new venture manager.

 The agreement was signed here today by R.S. Sharma, ONGC Group chairman, R.S. Butola, CEO of ONGC Videsh, and Jose Sergio Gabrielli De Azevedo, president of the board of directors of Petrobras. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the visiting Brazilian President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva were also present at the time of the signing.

 Sharma said, This agreement is the culmination of the MoU that we had signed with Petrobras in September 2006 in Brasilia. We are extremely pleased to join hands with Petrobras as it broadens our portfolio in Latin America. 

 We look forward to partnering Petrobras, one of the most renowned companies in deepwater operations. We strongly believe that the expertise of Petrobras in deepwater exploration will be utilised in the development of our offshore blocks in India. 

 Azevedo said: India was always a strategic country for us. We are extremely pleased with the development. The nature of this deal emphasises the strength of our relationship with ONGC and our belief in the Indian story. 

 Petrobras produces 2.3 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil and oil equivalent gas within Brazil and outside, Azevedo said.

 We plan to increase it to 3.4 million bpd by 2010 and 4.1 million bpd by 2015, he said.

 Most of the higher output will come from three deep-water fields Marlim, Roncador and Albacora Leste in Campos basin off Brazils east coast, Epifano said.

 Marlim is producing around 500,000bpd, Roncador is expected to produce 360,000bpd from September when two platforms will come on stream and Albacora produces 180,000bpd, he said.

 We are installing a platform in Albacora east, which will add another 180,000bpd, he added.

 Trade target

 India and Brazil today set a bilateral trade target of $10 billion by 2010.

 The Brazilian President said a scope for greater collaboration existed in energy, pharma and engineering sectors.

 Trade between India and Brazil has jumped from $488 million in 2000 to $2.4 billion in 2006. 

 Lula said the new world economic order cannot be negotiated without taking on board two of the most important developing nations.

 Big countries have to sit and bargain with us... We do not need lessons, we can teach them (developed countries). 

 He was addressing industry leaders at a luncheon meeting hosted by the three apex chambers. At the meeting, Lula offered Brazilian expertise in bio-fuels and farming.

 Brazil is a world leader in ethanol, producing about 16 billion litres a year. 

 India, which imports 70 per cent of its fuel requirements, has launched a programme to blend ethanol with petrol.

 Lula said India can also contribute in pharmaceuticals and both the countries can together work in the engineering sector as well.

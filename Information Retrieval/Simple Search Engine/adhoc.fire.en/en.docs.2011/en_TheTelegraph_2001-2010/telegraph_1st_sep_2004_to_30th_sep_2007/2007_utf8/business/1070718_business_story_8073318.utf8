 New Delhi, July 17: The income tax department is planning to issue biometric PAN cards, which would have the taxpayers retinal scan and fingerprints, to stop fraud. 

 However, existing PAN cards will remain valid and taxpayers need not switch over to the new cards immediately, though in the long-term the government would want everyone to change to the new cards.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram said, The process of eliminating about 13 lakh duplicate PAN cards is almost over. After this, all new PAN cards will only be biometric.

 The tax department, on an average, receives five lakh applications for PAN every month. So far, 4.7 crore PAN cards have been issued.

 Chidambaram said the biometric PAN cards are likely to be launched in October. The government wants to introduce iris-based biometric PANs to all new applicants once the present data about PAN cards is updated. 

 It will integrate 360-degree profiling of individual tax payers, he said.

 The move to introduce new PAN cards has been prompted not just by recent incidents of issue of fake cards but also threat of terrorism. 

 The department has already asked PAN service centres operated by National Securities Depository Limited and UTI Securities to undertake 100 per cent re-verification at their digitisation centres. They have also been asked not to accept PAN applications without the full names of the applicants. Earlier, applicants were allowed to use initials while filling the forms. 

 The department is also considering removing some of the validation documents allowed earlier as proof of identity and address.

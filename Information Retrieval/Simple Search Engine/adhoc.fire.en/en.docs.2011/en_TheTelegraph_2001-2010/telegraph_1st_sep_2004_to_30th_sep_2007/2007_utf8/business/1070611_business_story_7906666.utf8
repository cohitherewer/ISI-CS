 Israel defence firm set for foray

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 10: Elbit Systems, an Israel-based non-government defence company, is set to enter India. 

 Elbit will partner Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) and Merlin Hawk Associates Pvt Ltd to make parts and accessories for aircraft. 

 It will also focus on design, development, marketing and support of simulators and training systems.

 Elbit, which develops and manufactures advanced high-performance defence electronic systems, will pick up a 26 per cent stake in the joint venture. The company is targeting military and commercial customers. The joint venture will cater to the Indian Armed Forces and HAL aircraft development programmes.

 According to regulations, up to 26 per cent foreign direct investment including NRI investment in defence-related industries is permitted with prior government approval. This, however, is subject to licensing under the Industries (Development amp; Regulation) Act, 1951 and other guidelines on FDI in production of arms and ammunition in the Press Note 4 (2001 series) and Press Note 2 (2002 series). 

 The Foreign Investment Promotion Board has cleared the joint venture proposal of HAL and Elbit.

 HAL designs, develops and manufactures aeroplanes, helicopters, aero-engines, avionics and aircraft equipment. 

 Elbit was established in 1966 as Elbit Computers Ltd. Four years later, it was merged with Elop Electro-Optics Industries Ltd to become the biggest non-government defence company in Israel. 

 Merlin Hawk Associates designs and manufactures speciality products for application in aerospace and defence services.

 According to reports, a host of Indian companies, including Larsen amp; Toubro, the Tata group and Mahindra amp; Mahindra, are planning to make a foray into the defence segment. The defence ministry is planning to provide contracts worth around Rs 20,000 crore. 

 A division of Tata Power has already inked an agreement with the US-based Raytheon to work on defence and aerospace projects. 

 Earlier this year, Larsen amp; Toubro and European aerospace and defence group EADS said they were looking at business opportunities in defence and aerospace.

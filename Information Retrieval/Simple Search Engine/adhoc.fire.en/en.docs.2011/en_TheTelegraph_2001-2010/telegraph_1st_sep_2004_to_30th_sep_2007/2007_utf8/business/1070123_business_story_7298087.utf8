 Godrej to catch them young

 Nandi: GeNext drive

 New Delhi, Jan. 22: Godrej amp; Boyce is working on a brand makeover to take on Korean consumer durable companies.

 The company aims at attracting the youth with its revamped products, which will be introduced in the new fiscal.

 We are working on an image makeover. New packaging, style, colour schemes and the entire look and feel of the products will be worked on. We want to make it a more youthful brand to achieve greater connectivity. All these changes will take place and be visible in the new fiscal, Kamal Nandi, vice-president (sales and marketing) appliances division, Godrej amp; Boyce, told The Telegraph.

 The company has set aside Rs 100 crore for the revamp and is being helped by JWT, which has been Godrejs advertising agency for the last 30 years. 

 For the last decade, Korean companies Samsung and LG have been swamping the market with their products. Facing stiff competition on their home turf, Videocon and Godrej are now pulling up their socks.

 According to Nandi, the company is open to outsourcing technology in emerging segments like DVDs and microwave ovens.

 At present, we are not talking to any one. But, if a suitable opportunity arises, we will consider it, he said. 

 Growing at about 30 per cent on an average for the last three years, the company is targeting a turnover of Rs 1,400 crore in 2007-08. It expects to clock around Rs 1,000 crore during the current financial year.

 The growth will essentially come from two segments refrigerator and air-conditioners, said Nandi.

 Due to a rise in input costs, the company increased prices across product categories by 3-4 per cent last year.

 While a rollback is unlikely this year, Nandi said, The prices of air-conditioners are likely to increase by 7-8 per cent since copper prices have gone up. And, copper accounts for 30 per cent of the total cost of an airconditioner.

 Godrej will set up a frost-free refrigerator manufacturing facility in Pune at an investment of Rs 80-100 crore.

 The plant will be up and ready by the end of this calendar year. It will raise the total production capacity to 7 lakh units, said Nandi. The company now has a capacity of 3.5 lakh frost-free refrigerators per annum at its existing facility at Shirwal, 120 km from Pune.

 The companys combined direct-cool and frost-free refrigerator capacity stands at 10 lakh units per annum. It has a 20 per cent market share for refrigerators.

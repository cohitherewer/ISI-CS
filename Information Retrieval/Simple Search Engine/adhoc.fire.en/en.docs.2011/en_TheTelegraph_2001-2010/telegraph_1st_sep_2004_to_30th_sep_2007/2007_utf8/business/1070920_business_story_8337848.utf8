 Realtors live in hope

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 19: Bankers are discounting an immediate rate cut, but realtors live in hope.

 Faced with a sharp slump in property deals, the real estate industry is hoping that the Reserve Bank will take the cue from the Federal Reserve and trim rates.

 The market definitely expects a rate cut in the months to come, said Anuj Puri, managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj. We expect a rate cut of at least 50 basis points in the next three months, said a real estate expert.

 The Feds lowering of the benchmark interest rate to 4.75 per cent from 5.25 per cent will eventually trigger a rate cut in the country too, say industry insiders. Home loan borrowers have been spooked by the high interest rates and put off property purchases in the past six months.

 Many real estate developers are also finding it hard to raise funds for their projects after the Reserve Bank raised the risk weightages on bank loans, prompting them to raise funds from overseas equity markets. 

 Many developers have also faced a severe cash crunch which has made them look at the international market for raising capital. 

 The real estate sector is facing a severe demand-supply mismatch at the moment. According to estimates, there is a shortfall of close to 24 million units across India, which is inclusive of both commercial and residential properties. The interest rates, which started moving north around 2004, today stands at close to 11 per cent. 

 The central bank wanted to suck out the excess money from the market, but a high interest rate also created this huge demand supply mismatch, added an analyst. Lowering of the rate will ensue enough supply in the market which in turn will rationalise demand, says Mukesh Patel, managing director of NeelKanth Group.

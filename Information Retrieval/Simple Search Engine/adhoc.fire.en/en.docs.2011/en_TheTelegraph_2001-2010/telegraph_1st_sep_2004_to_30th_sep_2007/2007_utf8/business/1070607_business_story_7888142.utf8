 Securitised papers to be traded

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai June 6: The Securities and Exchange Board of India is planning to launch trading in securitised debt instruments or certificates.

 Securitisation is an instrument that involves the pooling of financial assets and issue of securities that are repaid from the cash flows generated by the assets.

 The issue is likely to be taken up by the market regulator at its board meeting later this month.

 Common assets for securitisation include credit cards, mortgages, auto and consumer loans, student loans, corporate debt, export receivable and offshore remittances. 

 Based on the receivables securitised, the resulting instrument is called mortgage-based securities in housing loans, collateralised bond obligations in bond receivables and collateralised loans obligations in industrial loan receivables.

 Securitisation is done mainly by private and foreign banks, though nationalised banks entered the segment recently.

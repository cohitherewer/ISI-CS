The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Bhel rival on drawing board

 Shinde: Moving on

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: The government is planning to set up a consortium to build power equipment. The entity will be led by the National Thermal Power Corporation and comprise some large global players.

 This is not the first time that the government is exploring the possibility of such a entity, which will rival the state-run Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (Bhel).

 An earlier proposal was put on the backburner, while discreet approval was given to a partnership between Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) and Japans Mitsui. Current discussions are for a consortium to make equipment for super-critical coal-fired plants, which are low on emissions.

 There is a thinking that NTPC and some big companies involved in super critical thermal power plant equipment manufacture could form a consortium, power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde told The Telegraph.

 L amp;T and Mitsui Heavy Industries are also entering this business, he added.

 Planners feel Bhel is in no position to meet the annual capacity addition target of 15000-16000MW as envisaged in the Eleventh Five Year Plan.

 The PSU has the capability to build equipment that will add 7,000MW to the capacity annually.

 Bhel says it will eventually scale up production to add 15,000MW every year, but this does not exclude the possibility of import till it meets the target.

 Shinde said, We want to bring electricity to every village by 2009 and light up every home by 2012. To do that we need to follow the Chinese example and plan equipment manufacture beforehand, Shinde said. 

 Global giants such as Japans Toshiba and Mitsubishi, Germanys Siemens, French power giant Alstom and GE of the US are tipped to partner NTPC.

 With an eye on lowering emissions, the focus is on equipment for super-critical coal-fired plants. 

 Shinde said: We are switching to 660MW super-critical thermal power plants.

 Thermal power will remain the mainstay and as we need to have cleaner coal-based technology to lower emission levels, super-critical plants will play an important role in the future, he said.

 L amp;Ts tieup with Mitsui is expected to be for building super-critical boilers. Though Bhel makes such boilers, power companies are averse to buying them.

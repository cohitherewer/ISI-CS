 Bengal permit key to Tata plan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 24: The success of the newly launched Ace Magic and Winger from Tata Motors in Bengal will mainly depend on the carriage contract issued by the state transport department.

 Such permits are given to public transports such as buses which generate revenues. If the Magic and Winger get these permits, they can compete with other three-wheelers.

 We have already launched the vehicles in Bihar and Jharkhand and the state governments have given us this permit. In Orissa, the permit has been issued and the models will be launched soon, said Vinod K. Sahay, regional manager, light commercial vehicle, eastern region, Tata Motors.

 The customers of the Magic and the Winger can also get a contract carriage permit. This permit is issued for buses used by companies to ply employees between specific points.

 While the Magic can seat five to seven persons, the Winger can accommodate 10 to 13. 

 The Winger can be used as school buses or ambulances. The model can also be used in car pools and in the tourism and hospitality segment. Sales will be bolstered if these models are used to commercially ferry passengers. They are safer than the existing three-wheelers as they have a four-wheel drive, said Binod Agarwal, managing director of Lexus Motors, the largest dealer of Tata Motors cars in the east.

 Lexus sells about 2,000 units of mini truck Ace in a year.

 Cell body challenges Trai report

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The Cellular Operators Association of India, a body representing GSM operators, today sent a letter to the telecom department challenging Trais recommendations on subscriber-linked spectrum allocation. 

 Trai has suggested that the minimum subscriber base an operator should have before it is granted additional spectrum be increased by two to six times. 

 For example, a GSM operator which was earlier entitled to 8MHz of spectrum for 0.8 million subscribers, will have to wait till it has three million subscribers. 

 The COAI has questioned the methodology and numbers used by Trai while calculating the subscriber-linked spectrum allocations.

 Trais calculations and the figures in its recommendations do not match. Moreover, tightening of the subscriber-linked criteria by more than 4-5 times is completely arbitrary and is not backed by any scientific and technical logic, said T.V. Ramachandran, director general of the COAI.

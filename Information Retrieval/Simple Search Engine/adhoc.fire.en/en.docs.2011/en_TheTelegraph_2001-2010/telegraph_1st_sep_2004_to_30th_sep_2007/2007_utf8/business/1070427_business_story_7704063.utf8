 Hutch stake sale tops FIPB agenda

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 26: The FIPB is likely to give its verdict on Vodafones $11-billion bid for Hutchison Essar tomorrow. The FIPB had thrice deferred its decision on the Vodafone proposal.

 It looks like we will take a decision on Friday, industry secretary Ajay Dua, an FIPB member, said.

 Representatives of Hutchison Telecom International Limited (HTIL) and Vodafone today had a meeting with finance secretary Ashok Jha on the shareholding pattern of Hutchison Essar.

 The meeting was also attended by two minority shareholders of Hutchison Essar, Asim Ghosh and Analjit Singh. While Ghosh is the managing director of Hutchison Essar, Singh is the chairman of Max India.

 We met the finance secretary to clarify our submission of April 9. We will await the outcome of the FIPB meeting tomorrow, Ghosh said. 

 Let FIPB take its own time, we will not interfere in the process of law. We respect the governments way of functioning. I expect nothing from tomorrow. That was not the aim of the meeting, Ghoshsaid. He did not share any other details of the meeting.

 The FIPB is looking into allegations of the FDI in Hutchison Essar being beyond the permissible limit of 74 per cent.

 Vodafone acquired Hutchison Essar in February but needs FIPB clearance for the deal. The FIPB has sought greater details on the size of the foreign holding in the firm.

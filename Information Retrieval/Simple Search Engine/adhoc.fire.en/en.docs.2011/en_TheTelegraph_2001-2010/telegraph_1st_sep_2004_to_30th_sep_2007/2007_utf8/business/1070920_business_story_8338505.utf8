 Foreign investors keep all guessing

 Mumbai, Sept 19: Stocks have hit a historic high as credit worries recede but the market has already started speculating about what foreign institutional investors will do next.

 The pundits in the market reckon that FIIs, which have pumped in over $9.46 billion into Indian equities so far this year, will continue to shovel money into the country.

 Although brokers find it difficult to estimate how much money will come into the country from these investors, the feeling is that Indias inherent strengths will lead to higher allocations from some of the leading global funds. The FIIs are believed to have put in at least $4 billion as the sensex rose from 15000 to 16000.

 The FIIs are likely to be positive in their approach to wards India. Valuations are under control, domestic demand is strong and we are not largely dependent on the US economy. All these bode well for fresh inflows, said Dhiraj Sachdev, vice-president and fund manager at HSBC Investments. 

 Sachdev is of the opinion that the potential for more money coming into emerging economies such as India is huge as these countries have only 10 per cent weight in the Morgan Stanley Capital Index. This has to change, he adds.

 Although recent data show some signs of a slowdown in industrial growth, market experts feel that the Indian economy will continue to grow at a robust pace and this could attract more money from overseas investors. The FIIs are likely to continue investing in India. We are likely to see the rally continuing for few more days, though there may be a breather later on. However, the sensex could very well hit 17000, Kunj Bansal, chief investment officer, portfolio management services, of Religare, said.

 Ambareesh Baliga of Karvy Stock Broking was, however, not too optimistic. Baliga said foreign investors had not been consistent buyers in the recent past. He said they had been wavering, alternating between selling and buying.

 It is difficult to say whether they will turn aggressive sellers at the current levels, but I dont see them investing in a big way, he added.

 An analyst, who shares Baligas opinion, said while many shares still looked attractive at these levels, foreign investors were unlikely to indulge in large-scale buying in view of the political uncertainties that may resurface again.

 Gold prices 

 Gold prices in India were seen heading towards the milestone of Rs 9,500 per ten gram after global prices surged to a 27-year peak of over $722 an ounce, driven by the US central banks decision to cut rate.

 Gold prices in the global market jumped to $722.05 an ounce today after the US Fed lowered its benchmark rate by half a percentage point to 4.75 per cent.

 The analysts believe that the rate cut will put downward pressure on the dollar, boosting the gold prices in the non-dollar currency markets.

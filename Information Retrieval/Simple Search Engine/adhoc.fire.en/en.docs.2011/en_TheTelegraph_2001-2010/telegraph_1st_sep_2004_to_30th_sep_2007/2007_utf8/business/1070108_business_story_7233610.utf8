 Small wonders

 Gift your child a mutual fund plan, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

What was Santas gift to your little prince or princess this Christmas? Toys, books or clothes? But surely not a mutual fund? 

 Consider this: The cost of an engineering degree was Rs 1 lakh in 1990. In 2000, it was Rs 3.2 lakh. At a compounded annual increase of 10 per cent, it will be Rs 8.3 lakh by 2010 and Rs 21.5 lakh by 2020. The cost of a medical or an MBA degree is also expected to grow six to seven times in thirteen years! 

 One needs to invest Rs 1,302 every month in an instrument that gives a compounded annual return of 20 per cent if he/she wants to accumulate Rs 25 lakh in 18 years the age at which one enrolls into a bachelors degree course. 

 Only for kids

 A number of mutual fund houses are offering equity-oriented and debt-oriented schemes for children. While equity-oriented schemes have given an annualised return of over 30 per cent for the past five years, debt-oriented schemes yielded more than 10 per cent on an average for the same period. 

 This means you can choose the systematic investment plan of an equity-oriented childrens mutual fund scheme with an equated monthly investment of Rs 1,300 and accumulate Rs 25 lakh when your child becomes an adult. But if you choose a safer investment option in debt-oriented schemes, you will have to invest Rs 2,600 or more every month. 

 Equity vs insurance 

 Simply put, equity-oriented hybrid funds are more economical than their debt counterparts, considering the long-term nature of the investment. Equity-oriented mutual fund schemes for children also score over juvenile life insurance schemes on offer. 

 Life insurers in the country offer two types of insurance plans for children first, where the child beneficiary is the policy holder and he or she gets the benefit on maturity of the plan. Second, where one of the parents is the policy holder and the maturity benefits accrue to the child. 

 Lower benefits

 Being an insurance policy, the final benefits on survival of the policy term in these plans is insignificant. The survival benefits in most of these policies is the sum assured plus the reversionary bonus announced by the insurer. A reversionary bonus is an addition to the maturity value and is calculated on the sum assured. 

 However, some insurers, such as Tata AIG Life Insurance Company, is giving a guaranteed 10 per cent addition besides the reversionary bonus. Even then, the final benefit (on survival) of a life insurance policy is far behind the returns from debt-oriented childrens mutual funds over a comparable period. This is because no insurer except LIC has so far been able to give 7-8 per cent bonus.

 As part of the premium payment in a life insurance policy goes towards the mortality risk coverage, the overall investment cost in a mutual fund investment is less than that in a life insurance plan. 

 Free cover

 Interestingly, most of the mutual fund houses selling childrens schemes are also offering free accident cover of up to Rs 3 lakh to one of the parents without any additional cost. The premium for this group insurance cover is borne by the mutual funds. SBI Mutual Fund also offers a 10 per cent additional benefit along with a Rs 3-lakh personal accident cover for one of the parents. 

 Some mutual funds, like Principal PNB, also offer a life insurance cover of up to Rs 50,000 for one of the parents free of cost for its Child Benefit Future Guard scheme. 

 Heavy exit load

 However, the flip side of investing in childrens mutual fund schemes is that the redemption of units before the child unit holder attains 18 years of age comes at a cost. For redemption of units within three years, an investor will have to pay a 3 per cent exit fee. Redemption of units without an exit fee is possible only after seven years. 

 No joint holding

 Another important aspect of childrens mutual funds is that the units can be purchased by the parents or a legal guardian only in the name of a child and there cannot be any joint holding. 

 If you have two children, you will have to buy units separately for each of them. However, nomination of another child in a single application is allowed. In the event of the death of the beneficiary unit holder child, the proceeds will accrue to the nominated child.

 Dud cheque caveat

 New Delhi, April 22 (PTI): The Supreme Court has ruled that 

 senior officials of a firm, such as chairpersons, managing directors and directors, can be held liable for criminal prosecution if 

 a cheque issued by their company bounces.

 The officials will have to prove that they were not in charge of 

 the company when the cheque was issued, a bench of justices 

 comprising Tarun Chatterjee and P.K. Balasubramanyam said 

 while upholding an appeal filed by BSNL.

 Moreover, the accused can adopt such a defence only at the 

 time of the trial but not during the registration of the case, the 

 apex court said.

 The bench gave its ruling while dealing with an appeal filed 

 by N. Rangachari, chairman and managing director of Data Access (India) Ltd, challenging a criminal case against him by 

 BSNL after two cheques issued by the company were dishonoured by a bank.

 Rangachari argued that no criminal case could be registered 

 against him as he was only the honorary CMD without any 

 power to sign cheques. He also claimed that he had resigned 

 from the firm on August 26, 2004, four days before the cheques 

 were issued. However, interpreting sections 138 and 141 of the 

 negotiable instruments act, the apex court said it was enough for 

 the complainant to have a fair belief that a particular officer was 

 in charge of the company when the cheque was issued.

 Calcutta, June 18: Visa Steel has been approached by foreign companies to collaborate in making high-value steel products.

 Chairman Vishambhar Saran said companies from China, Japan and Europe were interested in working with Visa Steel.

 Visa Steel is discussing various projects with Baoshan Iron and Steel Company, Chinas largest steel maker, but the talks are yet to reach the final stage, he said.

 Visa Steel could be a partner in the new project along with a foreign ally or it may be done through a separate entity all together, if it materialised, he added.

 However, Saran ruled out any stake sale in Visa Steel. We have received proposals from various companies. We are looking at fresh projects up the value chain, Saran said in Calcutta after announcing the annual results.

 Visa Steel has posted a 64 per cent jump in profit after tax in 2006-07 at Rs 20.52 crore, while revenue grew 39 per cent to touch Rs 537.93 crore.

 The companys share stayed in the upper circuit in a weak market, gaining 4.87 per cent or Rs 1.60 to close at Rs 34.45 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 The company is setting up a 0.5 million-tonne speciality and stainless steel project at Kalinganagar, Orissa, at an investment of Rs 1,800 crore.

 Managing director Vishal Agarwal said Visa Steel has increased the scope of the Orissa project with an additional investment of Rs 400 crore.

 The steel plant will be commissioned by the end of 2008. But a 50,000-tonne ferro chrome plant that is part of the project is expected to start production soon. The 300,000-tonne sponge iron and 50mw power plant will go on stream earlier than the steel plant. 

 The fresh investment is being made to set up a bar and wire rod mill and an additional 25mw of power capacity.

 New projects

 Visa Steel is expanding the scope of the Chhattisgarh greenfield steel plant, which was conceived a few years back. We have acquired 160 acres out of 600 required in Chhattisgarh, Saran said.

 The company has also approached the Jharkhand government to sign a memorandum of understanding to set up a 5mt steel plant in the state.

 Initially we thought of a 0.35mt plant. But now it is being expanded, he said.

 But the first priority of the company would be to set up the Orissa project.

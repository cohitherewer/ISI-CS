 StanChart to buy 49% of UTI Securities

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 23: Standard Chartered will pick up a 49 per cent stake in UTI Securities for Rs 147 crore. The foreign bank will acquire the stake from the Securities Trading Corporation of India (STCI), which owns 100 per cent in UTI Securities. 

 Standard Chartered today entered into a strategic partnership with STCI. Under the agreement, the parties have provided for necessary options to raise the banks stake to 100 per cent in stages by 2010, subject to necessary regulatory approvals. 

 STCI had acquired the stake in UTI Securities in 2006 from the administrator of the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India. 

 Standard Chartered director Jaspal Bindra said, This investment is significant for the group as it signals an entry into securities broking ... I see great potential for this business through this strategic partnership.

 Neeraj Swaroop, CEO of Standard Chartered, said the partnership would enable the bank to broaden its product offering in wealth management and private banking within India and the portfolio of non-resident Indian products in its footprint countries.

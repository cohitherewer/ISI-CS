 Oil bonds in the pipeline

 Relief at hand

New Delhi, Sept. 25: The government is likely to issue Rs 12,000-crore oil bonds to state-run refiners. 

 This will partially compensate the companies for selling fuels at prices lower than their cost of production. 

 Political compulsions have prevented the government from tinkering with fuel prices, while the surge in global crude rates is pushing up costs. 

 The oil bonds will not only keep the refiners happy but also rein in prices.

 Top petroleum ministry officials said the bonds were likely to be issued next month before the start of the festival season. 

 However, the quantum of the issue is much less than the Rs 24,000 crore demanded by the petroleum ministry.

 The refinery companies the Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited have lost Rs 55,000 crore by selling diesel, kerosene, petroleum and LPG at prices below the cost of production. 

 Based on the figure, petroleum minister Murli Deora was demanding Rs 24,000 crore of bonds. 

 The ministry had also sought a waiver of customs and excise duty on kerosene sold in the open market. 

 The average price of crude used in India has gone up to $75 a barrel. 

 With the country importing 70 per cent of its crude requirements, the high prices have resulted in daily losses of Rs 195 crore to the companies.

 Earlier, the ministry had approached the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs for an appropriate increase in the prices of petrol, diesel, kerosene and LPG. 

 The proposal was turned down because of the political consequences of the hike.

 However, the government is wary of adding to its debts through an indiscriminate issue of bonds.

 Its options in managing oil prices have been constrained by inadequate growth rates of domestic crude and natural gas production. 

 A ministry release said the production of crude fell by 2.8 per cent in August to 2.9 million tonnes and that of gas by 4.9 per cent to 2.7 billion cubic metres.

 The officials said, This means reliance on imports will have to continue and to pay for imports some kind of mechanism, in this case oil bonds, has to be issued by the finance ministry.

 Mumbai, Aug. 4: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) will invest $12-14 billion in exploration and production activities, apart from setting up a 1,400-km east-west pipeline. 

 We will invest around $12-14 billion in the next two to three years in areas such as exploration and production and laying of pipeline, Subhash C. Varma, president (development amp; production) of RIL, said here today. The investment will also include cash infusion in the companys overseas activities. 

 Reliance will invest in existing blocks as well as new ones. Last month, it had made a major oil and gas discovery in the deep waters of the Cauvery basin. 

 Initial tests showed the main zone of the well producing 31 million standard cubic feet of gas with 1,200 barrels of liquid hydrocarbon per day. Another zone produced around 550 barrels of oil per day with one million standard cubic feet of gas. 

 Cauvery was the fourth basin where Reliance discovered hydrocarbon. 

 The other offshore basins where the company discovered hydrocarbon include Mahanadi, Saurashtra and Krishna Godavari. 

 RIL has spent around Rs 9,000 crore on oil exploration, up from its initial estimates of Rs 3,000 crore. 

 It is now focusing more on developing the hydrocarbon wells because of a shortage of oil rigs. 

 The company is planning to undertake extensive seismic activities in all the major basins and could drill over 100 wells in the next three to four years. 

 RIL will also participate in the seventh round of auctions for oil and gas blocks under NELP-VII, which is expected to start in November this year. 

 Varma said the east-west pipeline would cost around $3 billion. The project will be implemented by Reliance Gas Transportation and Infrastructure Ltd (RGTIL). 

 The pipeline will cover Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat. RGTIL placed a Rs 498-crore order with Punj Lloyd for laying the pipeline and associated facilities for the project.

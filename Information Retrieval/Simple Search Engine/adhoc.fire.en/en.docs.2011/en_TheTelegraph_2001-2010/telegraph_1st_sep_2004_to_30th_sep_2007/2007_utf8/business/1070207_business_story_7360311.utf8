 Cut in grain output target

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Feb. 6: Fear of bad weather has forced the government to reduce the foodgrain target for the current fiscal by 10.83 million tonnes (mt) to 209.17 mt from 220 mt. This is just a million tonne more than the 2005-06 output of 208.19 mt. 

 The ministry of agriculture and cooperation which released the second advanced estimates today have cut the wheat estimate to 72.5 mt from 75.53 mt, sending shivers within the government which was banking on a robust buffer stock to fight inflation. The initial target was higher than the 2005-06 output of 69.35 mt.

 The target for rice has also been lowered by 3.3 mt from 90.13 mt earlier. However, for the rabi season the target has been revised upwards to 12.7 mt from 12.02 mt.

 In pulses, the target was raised to 15.15 mt from 14.52 mt. In the previous fiscal, the output was 13.39 mt.

 The government pinned hopes on the next harvest to ease the inflation rate that has in recent months been ruling above the 6 per cent mark. 

 The finance minister has assured an inflation rate of below 5 per cent, but current trends do not lend much support to his assertion.

 The nine major oilseeds are also slated to take a hit due to hostile weather conditions, with their estimates lowered to 236.19 lakh tonnes against 279.79 lakh tonnes in 2005-06. The initial target for oilseeds is 294 lakh tonnes in 2006-07.

 Sensex takes a plunge

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 8: Ahead of the third-quarter earnings season, a nervous stock market today saw bears pressing heavy sales in frontline stocks. Weak Asian cues and slow FII inflows further took its toll and saw the sensex decline by 208 points. 

 The bellwether index opened at 13855.89, marginally lower than Fridays close of 13860.52. It later fell sharply to hit an intra-day low of 13599.87 before ending the day at 13652.15 a net fall of 208.37 points or 1.5 per cent. 

 The nifty also dropped 50 points or 1.26 per cent to close at 3933.40 from its previous close of 3983.40. 

 According to market watchers, the IT sector got hammered due to a fall in American depository receipts (ADRs) on Friday. Investors also adopted a cautious approach and booked profits in the technology shares ahead of the earnings season. Infosys Technologies is scheduled to kick off the season on January 11. 

 The BSE IT index, therefore, tumbled 138.83 points or 2.60 per cent to 5204.88 from the previous close of 5343.71. 

 However, while the heavyweights continued to reel under selling pressure, certain counters found favour with the investors. Low global crude oil prices also provided underlying support to ONGC and Reliance Industries. 

 The market breadth was positive with 1,741 gainers against 934 losers of the total 2,724 traded counters. The trading volume was, however, low at Rs 3,742.62 crore. 

 According to the brokers, this might be the beginning of the much-awaited rally in small-cap and mid-cap shares, which have made some recovery since late December 2006. 

 According to Motilal Oswals earnings estimate, its universe of 129 stocks is expected to report a 46 per cent growth in profit in the third quarter against 20 per cent in the first quarter and 45 per cent in the second quarter.

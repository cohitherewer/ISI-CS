 Ulip details for investors

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, April 17: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has asked life insurance companies to reveal the details of their Ulip investments to investors. The regulator has modified the reporting format of the companies with effect from 2006-07.

 In a notice dated January 4, 2007, the regulator issued draft guidelines, which require a separate schedule for disclosures on investments and income in unit-linked businesses in an insurers annual financial accounts from 2006-07.

 After considering the feedback from insurers, the regulator issued a revised format on February 20. 

 The new format includes segregation of the revenue account of unit-linked businesses into two parts the non-unit funds account and the unit funds account as an addendum.

 The unit funds account will list the fund performance (growth) details in the reporting year, the previous year and a year before; performance since inception; date of inception; details of investment management activities outsourced and the fees paid for such activities; and company-wise details of investments held in the promoter group along with its percentage to funds under management.

 The regulator had earlier said insurers would have to give details of their investments in industries segregated at the scrip level where their exposure was 5 per cent or more. 

 Investments in industries where exposure is below 5 per cent should be grouped under the others head, the regulator said in its February circular.

 Insurers are also required to divulge their investments in the previous year.

 Many insurers have since made representations to the regulator explaining their difficulty to supply the investment data for 2005-06 and scrip-wise data for more than 5 per cent investment in an industry. Following this, IRDA has issued a fresh circular on April 16 relaxing the 5 per cent norm. 

 The stipulations in the said para may now be read as industry wise disclosure of investments (with exposure of 10 per cent and above) segregated at scrip level, the circular said. 

 It added, In view of the difficulty expressed by the life insurance industry in complying with the disclosure requirements for the corresponding previous year, the authority hereby relaxes the requirement for financial year 2006-07.

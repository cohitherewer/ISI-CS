 RPG mulls realty foray

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 2: RPG Enterprises, cashing in on the boom in real estate, has decided to join this sector.

 The group has floated a wholly owned subsidiary of its flagship company CESC Ltd to pursue the plan. Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of RPG Enterprises, has confirmed that real estate will be the area the group will venture into. Goenka said CESC Properties Ltd would initially develop the idle land that belongs to the company.

 To begin with, the new company will look after the mall at Park Circus in partnership with Godrej. The second project will be at Mulajore in the outskirts of the city. 

 We do not want people to lose focus on CESCs core power business. So the new company has been formed with dedicated people. We are starting with Park Circus and Mulajore, but will take up more work in the future, Goenka said.

 CESC has identified idle lands across various sites but Goenka chose not to divulge anything about them.

 The Mulajore plot will have low- and middle-income group housings and associated infrastructure. It may have some commercial (office/ mall) development as well.The parent company is funding the project at this point.

 Income in the period was up to Rs 615 crore from Rs 598 crore, a growth of 3 per cent.

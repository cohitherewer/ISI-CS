 FM vows all steps to contain inflation

 Chidambaram: Determined

 New Delhi, March 6: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the government will continue to take fiscal, monetary and supply side steps to moderate the high inflation rate and will not hesitate to import foodgrains and pulses if needed.

 On the track record of the NDA government he said, It took them 12-18 months to moderate the inflation rate in 2000-01 when it hovered over 8 per cent for 12 weeks and above 6 per cent for 48 out of 52 weeks.

 The current rate of inflation is not as high as 2000-01. We are confident, inflation will be moderated, he said during the question hour in Parliament. The inflation rate declined to 6.02 per cent last week from 6.5 per cent earlier, Chidambaram said, adding it is expected to further decline when the new wheat and potato crops come to the market. 

 The finance minister said crude oil prices have declined from a record high of over $75, but metal prices have spurted on international markets.

 Inflation spurts in the past have been moderated and we are confident of controlling the current rise, he said.

 Chidambaram said the demand-supply mismatch was the primary source of inflation. Production of wheat and pulses was way short of demand and, in the long term, augmenting production and productivity were essential to erase the gap.

 The budget for 2007-08, he said, has tried to address the shortcoming on the supply side by addressing key factors like water, seeds, fertilisers, power and farm credit.

 There is stagnation in production of wheat, paddy and pulses, Chidambaram said. Replying to a supplementary, he said the government has not allowed export of pulses and allegations against three exporters for defying the ban are being investigated.

 He said the government had over the last one year imported 55 lakh tonnes of wheat but couldnt get supplies of pulses. The pulses consumed in India are grown only in Myanmar, Turkey and in small quantities in Canada.

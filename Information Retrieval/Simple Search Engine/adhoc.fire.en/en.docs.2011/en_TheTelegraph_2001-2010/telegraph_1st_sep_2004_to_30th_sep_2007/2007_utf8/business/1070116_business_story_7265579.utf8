 Big scope for Bengal in auto components

 Building blocks

 Calcutta, Jan. 15: Bengal is gearing up to be a hub in auto components whose market size in India is estimated at $40 billion by 2014.

 For starters, the Automotive Components Manufacturers Association (Acma) is set to hold a major national event in the state on opportunities for the sector.

 This comes at a time when more than 70 to 80 vendors, including Bharat Forge, are flocking to the state for the Tata small car project.

 We are planning to hold this mega event the details of which would be finalised by the end of January. This will showcase the state and the regions capabilities as an auto component hub. There will also be a buyer and seller meet and all the national vendors and auto companies are expected to be present, said Raghu Mody, national president, Acma.

 Acma, which had shifted its eastern region office from the city to Jamshedpur and has a president from the east after decades, is looking at some kind of a presence in the city.

 The Bengal government had earlier also offered to work with industry associations and chambers of commerce to set up clusters in the state.

 Recently state cottage and small-scale industries minister Manab Mukherjee had said that there were many advantages for companies such as proximity to a port and availability of steel.

 We are looking at about 100 tier I suppliers for our small car project. The total number of suppliers will range from 300 to 400 and some of them would be from West Bengal and the neighbouring states. We would want them to be located in close proximity to the plant and hence the 1,000-acre plot also includes a provision for 300-acre vendor park, BB Parekh, deputy chief strategic sourcing, strategic sourcing group, Tata Motors Limited had said at a conference in the city.

 Boschs flagship company in India Mico is also looking at collaborating with the Tatas on the technology for the small car project. Bengals strategic position as a gateway to the east makes the state an important destination for component exports, which is set to grow by 34 per cent to $25 billion 2014. 

 As more Indian auto companies are investing in the Asean market like TVS and Bajaj, it gives component manufacturers another reason to cater to these markets faster and more efficiently. Bengal can play a much greater role in this regard, said Rakesh Shah, chairman, EEPC.

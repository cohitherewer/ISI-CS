The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Big plans for state

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 9: The Tata group isnt fazed by the skirmish over Singur and is drawing up plans for more investments in Bengal.

 Telco Construction Equipment Company Ltd (Telcon), a Tata Motors subsidiary, is looking to set up a plant in the state even as group companies such as Tata Steel and Tata Power are planning to ground separate projects.

 Ratan Tata refused to spell out the scale of investments in these projects. However, senior officials at Tata Motors told The Telegraph that Telcon was likely to invest Rs 400 crore in a unit to be located at Kharagpur. Telcon, which is a construction equipment company, is a 60:40 venture between Tata Motors and Hitachi Corporation.

 The land acquisition problems that the Tatas faced for the long-delayed small car project havent blunted its desire to funnel more money into new projects in the state. 

 While explaining to shareholders why he was going to Bengal, Tata said the company had gone there as a responsible corporate citizen and it wanted to boost economic development in the state. All had shied away from eastern India, particularly Bengal. Historically, it had been unfriendly to the private sector; today, the current Bengal government is amongst the most industry-friendly governments that exist in the country, he said.

 He said the state government had offered the best economic package even as it offered 12 different sites for the small car project that Tata Motors could choose from.

 I hope we will be able to transform the quality of life of the people in the region, bring prosperity, and create skills, he added.

 Ministry to start talks with airline employees

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 15: The empowered group of ministers (EGoM) headed by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee today asked the civil aviation ministry to initiate talks with the employees of Air-India and Indian Airlines.

 The EGoM has decided to take up the integration of the employees in a cautious manner to avoid any unwanted situation and to see that their (employees) interests were protected, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said.

 The ministry will hold talks with the representatives of the employees unions of both the airlines and take their views into consideration. These will then be put before the EGoM in the next meeting of the ministerial group, which will take place in a fortnight. I will meet the employees this week itself, said the minister. Warding off fears of retrenchment, Patel said, I now have the mandate to speak to the employees and will assure them that there would not be any retrenchments.

 Air-India and Indian have an estimated combined employee strength of 33,000. 

 The one-time cost of merger will be around Rs 150-200 crore, Patel said, adding that the benefit could be about Rs 800 crore and the cumulative annual benefit is being estimated at Rs 500 crore. 

 Patel said todays meeting approved the recommendations by the Committee of Secretaries on taxation and stamp duty issues for the merger which could be achieved by amending section 72(A) of the I-T Act. The stamp duty incidence is around Rs 50 crore, with the highest in Maharashtra where Air-India has the biggest asset, he said.

 Bajaj-TVS spat continues

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: Bajaj Auto has hardened its stand on the alleged patent infringement by rival TVS Motor and said it would take all necessary steps to safeguard its interests and inflict maximum permissible damage upon the offender.

 Responding to TVS Motors threat to file a Rs 250-crore damage suit, Bajaj Auto CEO (two-wheelers) S. Sridhar said, Bajaj is preparing to defend its intellectual property rights in the event such a product is eventually introduced. 

 At the time, if evaluation of the actual product appears to suggest reasonable grounds for infringement, Bajaj will take all necessary steps to safeguard its interests as also to inflict the maximum permissible damage upon the offender to set an effective precedent for the future. 

 Last week Bajaj Auto had alleged that TVS had infringed its patented technology the digital twin spark ignition (DTSi) by using it in the 125cc bike named the Flame.

 In response, TVS Motors said it would take legal action against the company for tarnishing the name of the TVS group and would file a suit of Rs 250 crore unless Bajaj Auto withdrew its allegations.

 TVS Motor is surprised at the wild and irresponsible allegations made by Bajaj Auto accusing TVS Motor Company of breaching their patent rights. The accusation is a malicious attempt to tarnish the fair name of the TVS group, which has consistently maintained the highest standards of ethics in business, the company said in a statement. 

 TVS Motors vice-president Cecil K. Dewars said, We stand by our statement. Our technology is different from theirs and they (Bajaj) need to prove (that TVS infringed). 

 Responding to whether the spat would impact TVS plans to roll out the Flame, Dewars said, We are going ahead according to the schedule and there is no question of changing it. 

 Sridhar said Bajaj Auto had received necessary approvals in July 2005 via patent number 195904. The company believed that the use of twin spark technology, christened Bajaj DTS-i, in small automotive engines is worthy of intellectual protection.

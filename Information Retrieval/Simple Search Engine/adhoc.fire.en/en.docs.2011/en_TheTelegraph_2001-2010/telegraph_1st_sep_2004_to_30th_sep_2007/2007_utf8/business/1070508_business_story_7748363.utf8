 Mumbai, May 7: The Reserve Bank of India has asked commercial banks to fix a ceiling on rates and processing charges to be levied on personal loans. The rbi has given banks three months to comply with its directives. This has been done to prevent banks from charging high rates, which are neither sustainable nor in conformity with the banking practice. The rbi further said the total cost to the borrower, including interest and all other charges levied on a loan, should be justifiable, taking into consideration the total cost incurred by the bank in extending the loan.

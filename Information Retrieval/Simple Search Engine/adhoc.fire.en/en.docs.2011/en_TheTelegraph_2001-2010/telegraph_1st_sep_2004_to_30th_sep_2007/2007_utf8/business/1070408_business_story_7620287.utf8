 Calcutta, April 7: Goodricke Group has shelved its plans to diversify into the wine business in India.

 We have decided not to go ahead with the wine business in India. We are a company with limited resources and would like to make judicious use of them. However, we are examining other options for diversification, Goodricke Group chairman P.A. Leggatt said at the companys annual general meeting.

 The groups holding company, Camellia Plc UK, runs a wine business in South Africa under the brand name of Linton Park Plc. Goodricke had recently mandated managing director K.S. David to look after the diversification process. 

 Leggatt said the company had two options either to import wine or grow and market the product here. For the time being, however, Goodricke has decided not to do either. It is not a reflection on the Indian wine market but a business decision on our part, he said.

 Instant tea

 Goodricke is in talks with a US-based buyer for its instant tea business. 

 Goodricke holds the patent rights for hot and cold water soluble teas in the UK, Sri Lanka, Kenya and India. The business ran into rough weather last year due to a demand and supply imbalance.

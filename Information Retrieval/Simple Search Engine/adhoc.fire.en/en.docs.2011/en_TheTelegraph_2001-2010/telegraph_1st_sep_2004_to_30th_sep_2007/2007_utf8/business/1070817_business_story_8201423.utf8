 Rub-off effect on rupee

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 16: The turmoil in global stock markets has hit the rupee, which crashed 1.5 per cent to its biggest one-day loss this year against the dollar. 

 The rupee dived 61.50 paise to 41.37 from Tuesdays close of 40.75 on worries related to inflows from foreign institutional investors and the yens appreciation 

 The rupee opened lower at 41.04 and slid to an intra-day low of 41.20. Dealers said initially there was some stability in the rupees value as exporters were seen selling the US currency. It was then that the news of the yens appreciation against the dollar broke out. 

 Analysts said the appreciation of the Japanese currency meant that investors were unwinding their Yen Carry Trades. This is a strategy where an investor borrows yen at Japans low interest rates and converts it into dollars to buy assets in other countries. 

 Unwinding of these trades means investors are pulling money away from assets such as equities invested in other countries and returning the yen loans, a development that is not good for the stock markets and ultimately the rupee as foreign inflows into India could get affected. 

 Analysts said in percentage terms, todays fall was the steepest for the rupee since March 29 and the second biggest in more than 11 years since March 1996.

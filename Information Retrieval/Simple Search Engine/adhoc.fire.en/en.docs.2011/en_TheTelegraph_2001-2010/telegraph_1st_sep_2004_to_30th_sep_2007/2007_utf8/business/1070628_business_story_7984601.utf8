 Calcutta, June 27: Bata India will start work on a township project at Batanagar in six weeks. 

 Bata chairman P.M. Sinha said the company was expecting necessary approvals from the authorities within a month.

 The work will start after that. We expect revenue from the project to reflect in the Bata balance sheet from 2009, Sinha said after the 74th annual general meeting of the company here today. The work has got slightly delayed as the company is yet to get an environmental clearance.

 Bata has formed a 50:50 joint venture with the Calcutta Metropolitan Group to develop an integrated township and a special economic zone for the IT sector.

 The joint venture, Riverbank Holdings Pvt Ltd, will develop 262 acres adjacent to the companys factory at Batanagar. The total investment in the project is estimated at Rs 1,300 crore, excluding the cost of the land and the amount required for school, hospital and hotel construction.

 The IT SEZ on 25 acres has received the Centres nod. It will involve an investment of Rs 333.49 crore. Batas investment in the project is restricted to the land. The company will also get housing for its employees free of cost. Riverbank has inked a Rs 50-crore deal with Reliance for the latters retail project.

 Expansion plans

 The shoe major said it planned to open 200 stores in the next two to three years and refurbish 600 existing ones. Sinha said substantial investment had been lined up but refused to give the exact amount.

 The company plans to fund the expansion primarily through debt and internal accruals. Bata has 1,100 stores. It recently opened 37 new-age stores across the country. 

 The expansion drive comes close on the heels of its negotiations with shop employees and managers to keep outlets open for seven days a week and longer hours during February-April. These stores have contemporary designs similar to those in Singapore, Malaysia and Italy. 

 Shaibal Sinha, director (finance) and the man credited with the turnaround of the loss-making Bata, said the exercise resulted in a substantial improvement in sales.

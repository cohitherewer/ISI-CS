 Calcutta, May 15: Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL) has posted a 95 per cent jump in after-tax profit in 2006-07.

 However, the growth rate of gross sales was much lower at 21 per cent.

 A strong demand and the strategy to focus on value added products pushed the profit after tax to an all-time high of Rs 584 crore on gross sales of Rs 8,376 crore.

 In the last fiscal, the profit was Rs 300 crore, while gross sales stood at Rs 6,928 crore.

 The operating profit increased 25 per cent to Rs 1,421 crore from Rs 1,138 crore in the previous year. 

 HPL managing director Swapan Bhowmik said the companys aim was to become a leader in its field not only in India but also in the world.

 We intend to expand our market share, increase our production capacity and enhance our competitiveness in the coming years, he said in a statement.

 Total production in 2006-2007 stood at 1.4 million tonnes compared with 1.39mt in 2005-2006, an increase of 2 per cent. Sales went up by 4 per cent to 1.37mt compared with 1.32 mt in the previous year. 

 Experts said the company reported high margins despite volatility in the prices of naphtha, which is the main feedstock in production. The prices of naphtha are linked to crude prices.

 Holding pattern

 The company today released its shareholding pattern that showed the Bengal government to be the majority owner.

 WBIDC holds a 51.67 per cent stake in the HPL. It holds equity shares of Rs 675 crore and preference shares of Rs 271 crore .

 The Chatterjee Group (TCG) companies and associates hold a 37.68 per cent stake. They hold shares worth Rs 689 crore. A TCG spokesperson, however, said the numbers were incorrect.

 Sebi chief for fewer regulators

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Damodaran: Firm stand

 New Delhi, Aug. 9: Sebi chief M. Damodaran today said the government should limit the number of regulators and strengthen the existing bodies.

 Instead of having a slew of regulatory bodies for every sector, we need to strengthen the functionality of existing regulators for effective and efficient use in related sectors, Damodaran said.

 The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said there was a need to have more self-regulatory organisations. 

 Companies are shying away from setting up self-regulatory forums as they realise that it will be easier to blame an external regulator than take up the responsibility of forming ones own rules and abiding by them.

 On the nature of regulations, he said it should be a mix of rules and principles. The US is moving towards principles from a rule-based system.

 There is a definitive divide between the thinking process of top management and middle-level managers. While the top management believes in a principle-based regulatory system, the middle level wants to play safe by demanding that each and every action be documented and based on written rules. 

 Regulations should be prepared through consultations with industry in a transparent manner, the Sebi chief said. 

 Damodaran said he was open to having government officials on a part-time basis as members of regulatory bodies.

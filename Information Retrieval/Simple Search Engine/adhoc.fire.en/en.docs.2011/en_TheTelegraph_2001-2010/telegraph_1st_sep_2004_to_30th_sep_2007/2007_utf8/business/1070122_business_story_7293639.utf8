 Investor protection fund norms 

on course

 New Delhi, Jan. 21 (PTI): The finance ministry is likely to table the Sebi amendment bill in the budget session. The bill has a provision for setting up an investors protection fund (IPF). In his budget speech last year, finance minister P. Chidambaram had promised this fund. According to a senior finance ministry official, Sebi chairman M. Damodaran met Chidambaram yesterday to give a final shape to the proposals of the bill.

 The finance ministry will now start preparing a cabinet note and after getting the clearance, the bill may be tabled in the upcoming budget session, an official said.

 The amendments include more powers to the market regulator to administer the stock market and safeguard the interests of investors.

 Besides the fund, the bill will contain provisions on disgorgement compounding and plea bargaining. The proposed amendment would arm Sebi with powers to utilise the money collected in the protection fund as fines and penalties from the listed companies and brokers. 

 Sources said the fund collected through disgorgement would also go to the protection fund. However, money collected through the recent disgorgement order of Sebi will not go to the fund since it does not have retrospective effect.

 Sebi passed a disgorgement order for the first time in November 2006 in the initial public offer allotment scam. It asked the depositories, NSDL and CDSL, and eight other depository participants (DPs) to cough up Rs 115.81 crore.

 Disgorgement is repayment of funds received through illegal or unethical business transactions. The investors who might suffer financial losses due to any scam in the stock market, will be compensated from the protection fund, the official said.

 However, Sebi has so far not decided how to compensate retail investors from the money to be collected from NSDL, CDSL and the eight DPs.

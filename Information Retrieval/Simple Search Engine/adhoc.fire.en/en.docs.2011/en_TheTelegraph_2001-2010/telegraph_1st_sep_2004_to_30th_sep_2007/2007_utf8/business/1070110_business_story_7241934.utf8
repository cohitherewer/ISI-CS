 New Delhi, Jan. 9: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said supply side constraints imposed by industry were ratcheting up the inflation rate.

 As we close a good year, the only dark cloud is rising inflation, Chidambaram told the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry at its annual general meeting here today. 

 He added: I have a nagging feeling that there are sectors that have smelt an opportunity to make profit because of high demand. There is nothing wrong in making profits, but beware of entrenched core inflation. Cut costs to stabilise prices.

 The finance ministers underlying message, according to government officials, was duty concessions will not be available to those sectors which were making profits from short-term curbs on supply. The sectors have been clamouring for such cuts from the government.

 He said companies in many cases were making profits by not passing down the excise cuts to consumers.

 The finance minister said certain manufacturing items were contributing more to inflation than primary articles and fuels. Not only was demand very high but supply side constraints were also providing the headroom to inflate prices, he said.

 Chidambaram warned that manufacturers were erring by focusing on short-term gains from withholding stocks and that they would be better off in the long run if they take rising prices as a signal to ramp up production.

 Chidambaram said he was worried over the poor performance of certain sectors such as food products, paper, leather, chemical, basic metals and machinery.

 Budget meeting

 Later, at the pre-budget meeting with the finance minister, industry demanded sops, excise cuts and customs duty protection in some cases.

 They also sought government support in cross-border acquisitions at a time when the Tatas are fighting to acquire UK-based Corus. 

 We want the government to extend political, social and financial incentives while India Inc engages in acquisitions abroad, Assocham president Anil K. Aggarwal said after the meeting. 

 Videocons V.N. Dhoot suggested benefits be made in proportion to the capital invested abroad. Sources said Ratan Tata nodded when Dhoot raised the matter with the finance minister.

 Industry demanded corporate tax rate be brought down to 25 per cent from 30 per cent. It also sought tax exemptions on research and development beyond 2007 by another 10 years and extension of these exemptions to other industries, besides pharma and automobiles.

 RBI warning on hedge funds

 Reddy: Points to ponder

 Mumbai, March 19: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy has stressed the need for transparency in the portfolios of hedge funds to avoid operational risks. His remarks come at a time when the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is planning to bring hedge funds directly into the domestic stock markets by allowing them to register with the market regulator.

 Reddy said in terms of financial stability, some new challenges were emerging. He pointed out that the international financial markets are dominated by private equity funds like hedge funds, which largely operate outside the know-your-customer or know-your-investor (KYC/KYI) norms. 

 Reddy was delivering the inaugural address on Globalisation and Monetary Policy: Some Emerging Issues at a conference organised by the Center for Economics and Development, Northwestern University, USA and Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research.

 Reddy, who sounded the note of caution on hedge funds, said such funds used arrangements that allow them to execute trades with several dealers. However, now these funds tend to consolidate the clearing and settlement of their trades at a single firm, called the prime broker.

 The RBI governor said a prime brokerage poses some unique challenges for the management of counter-party (the other party with whom a deal is done). It is commonly observed at the global level that hedge funds are opaque that is, information about their portfolios is typically limited and sketchily provided. From a policy perspective, transparency to investors is largely an issue of investor protection, but the need for counter-parties to have adequate information is a risk-management issue, he added. 

 Reports, however, say that Sebi has directly invited hedge funds to register with it and invest in the Indian stock markets without going through the participatory note (PN) route. Sebi chairman M. Damodaran had, in the past, said hedge funds should be allowed direct entry rather than through PNs, which are offshore derivative instruments. 

 Market observers feel that the market regulator could remove many of the apprehensions related to hedge funds.

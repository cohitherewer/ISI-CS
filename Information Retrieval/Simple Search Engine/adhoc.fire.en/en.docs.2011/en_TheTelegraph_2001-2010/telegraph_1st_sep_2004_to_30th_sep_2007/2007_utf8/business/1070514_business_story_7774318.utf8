 TIPS ON GIFTS

 Receiving or giving money as gifts without a thought could land you in a tax mess, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 Its your first wedding 

 anniversary and your best friend gives you a cheque of Rs 

 60,000. He wants you to buy a plasma television you have 

 always dreamt of owning. 

 But wait! Do you know what you 

 are getting into? You will have to pay tax on the entire 

 amount of Rs 60,000. Ask your friend to gift you the television 

 instead. That way, none of you will have to pay a tax. 

 A person gifting more than Rs 

 50,000 has to pay a tax on the amount and the individual 

 or the Hindu undivided family (HUF) receiving it has to 

 include the amount as income from other sources in their 

 returns and also pay tax on it. Some 

 exceptions 

 The law allows you to give or receive gifts without 

 paying any tax to/from:

 Any close relative

 On the occasion of the marriage of the individual

 A will or by way of inheritance

 In contemplation of death of the payer

 From any local authority such as municipality

 From any fund, foundation, university and other educational 

 institution, hospital and other medical institution or 

 any trust registered under section 10, such as the Prime 

 Ministers National Relief Fund, non-profit educational 

 institutions and charitable trusts.

 Whos a close relative

 I) Spouse

 II) Brother or sister 

 III) Brother or sister of spouse 

 IV) Brother or sister of either 

 of the parents of the individual

 V) Any lineal ascendant or descendant 

 of the individual

 VI) Any lineal ascendant or descendant 

 of his/her spouse 

 (VII) Spouse of the person referred 

 to in (ii) to (vi)

 One can give or receive any sum 

 of money to or from close relatives without paying a gift 

 tax. However, gifts from a non-relative, such as a friend, 

 up to Rs 1 lakh is tax-free if received on the occasion 

 of marriage.

 On any other occasion, you can 

 receive gifts from a non-relative up to Rs 50,000 in one 

 financial year either in cash or by demand draft or cheque 

 and for that you do not have to pay any income tax. But 

 for any amount, even a rupee, in excess of Rs 50,000, you 

 will have to pay tax on the entire sum. 

 Go for kind

 Gifts received in kind are tax-free. 

 You wont have to pay any tax if your friend gifts you a 

 television worth Rs 60,000 on your marriage anniversary.

 However, you may have to satisfy 

 the taxman about the financial status of the donor. Simply 

 put, you may have to establish that the donor has enough 

 income to gift you that money. 

 You may also need to establish 

 a donor-donee relationship. Heres how you do it: The donor 

 (person who gives) writes an offer letter to the donee (person 

 who receives); or the donee approaches the donor for a gift 

 and, on receipt of the gift, the donee acknowledges the 

 gift in writing.

 Income from gift

 Any income from the gifted asset 

 to the spouse or minor children or sons wife is taxed in 

 the hands of the donor. 

 Let us assume you gift Rs 1 lakh 

 to your wife who invests the money in a bank fixed deposit 

 at an annual interest rate of 9 per cent. The annual interest 

 income of Rs 9,000 from the deposit will be clubbed with 

 your income and you will have to pay an income tax on it. 

 Go for Mutual funds

 However, any secondary income 

 from the interest amount of Rs 9,000 supposing the money 

 is invested in a recurring deposit will be taxed at the 

 hands of your wife. 

 So, while gifting a sum of money 

 to your close relatives, make sure that the money is invested 

 in instruments exempt under section 10 of the income tax 

 act. Such income include dividend from mutual funds, capital 

 gains, and interest income on specified government bonds 

 and securities. 

 Hence, the best way to gift money 

 to your near and dear ones is either to buy some company 

 shares or units of mutual funds. 

 While the dividend income on shares 

 and units of mutual funds are tax-free in the hands of the 

 recipient, there is also no long term capital gains tax 

 on equities.

 Sensex again in the red

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT : 

 Mumbai, March 2: A bearish sentiment prevailed in the bourses today amid weak Asian markets and sustained profit-booking by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) as the sensex plummeted by 273 points to end below 13000 at 12886.13. 

 Even a fall in the inflation rate to 6.05 per cent for the week ended February 17 failed to improve sentiments as FIIs and other investors sold aggressively in the final 90 minutes of trading.

 FIIs have sold more than Rs 2,000 crore of equities in the past couple of trading sessions with Rs 1,600 crore sold on the budget day alone. Market circles attribute the sales to the weak mood in the emerging markets and the budget which disappointed investors.

 The cues from the emerging markets were not positive at the onset of trading today. The Asian markets were sluggish with Japans Nikkei ending lower by 235.58 points and Koreas Kospi by 2.87 points. 

 After opening at 13139.10, marginally higher that the last close, the sensex touched a high of 13254.03. However, it moved downwards to the days low of 12836.75 before ending at 12886.13, a net fall of 273.42 points or 2.08 per cent from the previous close of 13159.55.

 Biocon set to widen reach

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mazumdar-Shaw: Upbeat

 Bangalore, Jan. 18: Biocon has drawn up a roadmap to strengthen its overseas marketing and distribution network and has tied up with companies in the Gulf and Pakistan.

 Chairman and managing director Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw told The Telegraph that the company would tap the vast potential of its new cancer drug, Biomab EGFC. We want to increase our reach in neighbouring countries. We have granted an exclusive licence to Ferozsons Laboratories to sell the drug in Pakistan where the market is valued at $70 million. Our drug will help pave way for an affordable treatment, she added.

 The cancer drug was introduced in the domestic market last September. Biocon has received enquiries from across the world since then.

 Mazumdar-Shaw said consolidated revenues for the nine-month period grew 23 per cent at Rs 710 crore from Rs 578 crore in the year-ago period. Profit after tax rose 11 per cent to Rs 140 crore from Rs 126 crore.

 Biocon has posted 44.89 per cent increase in net profit in the third quarter at Rs 47.51 crore compared with Rs 32.79 crore in the year-ago period.

 Total income rose to Rs 216.35 crore, up 24.06 per cent from Rs 174.39 crore for the same period in the previous year.

 This quarters growth is mostly because of research services and biopharmaceuticals delivering a strong growth supported by statin exports to the US and technology and licensing revenues.

 The company has signed an MoU for a joint venture with Abu Dhabi-based NMC group for strategic marketing and manufacturing cooperation for the GCC region.

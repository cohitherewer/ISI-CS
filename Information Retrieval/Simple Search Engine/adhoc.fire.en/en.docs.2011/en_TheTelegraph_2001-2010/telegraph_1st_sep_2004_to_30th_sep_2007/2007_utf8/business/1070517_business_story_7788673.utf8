The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Century cements base

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, May 16: City-based Century Plyboards India Ltd has drawn up expansion plans for its cement and plywood business.

 The company plans to set up a 1-million-tonne cement plant in Siliguri at an investment of Rs 150 crore. 

 The unit will cater to the north Bengal market. 

 The plant is expected to come up in the next three years, Sajjan Bhajanka, managing director of Century Plyboards, said today.

 The demand for cement in north Bengal is about 2mt. However, there are no production units in the region except for Gujarat Ambujas proposed Farakka unit.

 The Bengal plan is part of the companys strategy to ramp up the capacity of its cement business to 5mt in the next three years at an investment of Rs 1,150 crore.

 The company has a 1mt plant in Meghalaya through its wholly owned subsidiary, Cement Manufacturing Company Ltd.

 It plans to invest Rs 700 crore to set up another 2mt clinker plant in Meghalaya. Clinker is an intermediate product used in cement. 

 The company has also proposed three grinding units at Kahelgaon in Bihar, Guwahati and Siliguri.

 We are now making the project report for the clinker plant that will come up simultaneously with the three grinding units, Bhajanka said.

 Plywood business

 In the plywood segment, the company will acquire Sharon Vineers in Chennai and Century Panel in Haryana.

 The deals will be done through a share swap whereby promoters of the merged companies will get equity shares of Century Plyboards. Hence, no cash transaction will take place.

 After the merger with the two firms, the companys turnover will touch Rs 600 crore from Rs 450 crore last year. 

 Our share capital may increase from Rs 19.85 crore to Rs 22.5 crore after the merger, Bhajanka said.

 The company is scouting for a new unit in plyboard. 

 The plant is likely to come up in Meghalaya.

 The group also plans to invest Rs 350 crore on a ferro silicon project and a power plant in the Northeast.

 Bhajanka said his companys cement business planned to make a public offer to raise Rs 200 crore for the projects while an equal amount will come from internal generation.

 The capital investment subsidy given to the north eastern projects will also help to bring down the cost.

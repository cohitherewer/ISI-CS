 Sarin sings Singh tune on rural pledge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Singh and Sarin: Meeting of minds 

 New Delhi, Feb. 16: Vodafone CEO Arun Sarin today assured Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that his companys plans for India were in line with the government policies since the bulk of Vodafones proposed $2-billion investments in Hutchison Essar would be in rural telephony, which the government was keen to push.

 Emerging from Singhs residence, before flying off to London in a private jet, Sarin said he was confident of the Essars signing the shareholders agreement with Vodafone and remain partners in Hutchison Essar.

 Sources said Sarins meeting with Singh was not only to brief the Prime Minister about Vodafones rural plans but also to ensure that the deal was above board, especially in the wake of allegations by the Hindujas that despite putting in a higher bid, Hutchison preferred Vodafone to them.

 Though Sarin has dismissed the Hindujas claim as baseless, he still does not want to leave anything to chance and seems to be taking care to guard his flanks.

 Sarin also appeared confident about putting at rest the differences with Essar. The Ruias of the Essar group had objected to not being consulted by Vodafone when the UK company entered into an arrangement with Bharti to share telecom infrastructure just a day after landing Hutchison Essar.

 We will ensure that all of our shareholder rights, including those under our shareholders agreement with Hutchison, are adhered to, the group had said.

 Sarin said Vodafone would discuss its plans with Essar and added that the shareholders agreement with Essar will be hopefully signed soon.

 Yesterday, after a meeting with Sarin, the Ruias had said they would take a decision in due course.

 Vodafone plans to invest over $2 billion in the next two years to reach a subscriber target of 100 million and become the market leader. The bulk of the funds would be used to expand the companys rural reach, Sarin had said.

 NHPC selloff gathers pace

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, April 5: The government will sell 5 per cent of its stake in state-run NHPC along with the companys proposed public offer in June, thus reviving the divestment process put on hold by the Congress-led government.

 For the twin objectives, nearly 167 crore shares, at a face value of Rs 10, will be offered to the public after which the governments equity in the PSU will be reduced to 86.30 per cent. The governments 5 per cent stake will constitute 558,683,315 equity shares. 

 NHPC has a paid-up capital of Rs 10,600 crore and, going by the face value, the IPO of 15 per cent will help raise a minimum of Rs 1,590 crore.

 While proceeds from the 10 per cent fresh equity will be retained by the company to part-finance upcoming projects, that from 5 per cent will go to the government.

 The UPA government had halted the divestment process in PSUs, giving in to pressure from the Left allies and DMK, which had opposed a proposal to divest stake in Neyveli Lignite Corporation last year.

 The last time that a divestment took place was in NTPC in 2004, when the government followed a similar process of piggy-backing on fresh equity issued by the power corporation.

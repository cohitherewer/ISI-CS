 NTPC inks pact with PSUs

 Mumbai, Sept 3 (pti): National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd (ntpc) has signed a memorandum of understanding with four public sector undertakings to form a special purpose vehicle for securing thermal coal from abroad.

 The MoU was signed with Steel Authority of India Ltd, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd, Coal India Ltd and National Mineral Development Corporation Ltd.

 According to the agreement, the public sector undertakings would have to cooperate to create projects and country-specific joint venture companies, which may also involve equity participation.

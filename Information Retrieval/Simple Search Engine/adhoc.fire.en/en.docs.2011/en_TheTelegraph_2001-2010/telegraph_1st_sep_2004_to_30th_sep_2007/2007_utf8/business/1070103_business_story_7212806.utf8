 Hutch Essar war may take new turn

 Bidding game

 London/New Delhi, Jan. 2 (PTI): The high-profile bidding war for control of Hutch Essar could intensify with reports in the British media suggesting that Indian partner Ruias have received funding pledges worth up to $25 billion to buy out foreign stakeholder Hutchison Telecom.

 Essar has lined up Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered, Lehman Brothers and Citigroup as lead arrangers for funding a takeover bid for Hutchison Essar, the Financial Times reported.

 The newspaper quoted unnamed people familiar with the matter as saying Essar has received funding pledges worth $20-25 billion, but is yet to decide whether to make a formal offer.

 Meanwhile, top officials of another potential bidder, Maxis of Malaysia, are believed to be in Hong Kong for talks with Hutchison Telecom about a revised offer to purchase its Indian business, sources said.

 The visit follows after Maxis initial offer of $13.5 billion was reportedly rejected as the Hong Kong-based firm thought the valuation was below expectations.

 A Maxis spokesperson was not available for comments.

 Financial Times also quoted people close to talks related to rival bids as saying they were sceptical about the ability of Essar, which has an enterprise value of $15 billion, to raise that level of financing for a proposed deal.

 The move underscores Essars potential as a serious bidder for Hutchison Telecoms 67 per cent stake in their Indian joint venture, an outcome that would be bad news for rival bidders Vodafone and Reliance Communications, the paper said. 

 The newspaper report also said people familiar with Essars plans believe Hutchison Essar, with debt of only about $1 billion, could carry some of the burden.

 Citigroup, one of the lead fund arrangers for Essar as reported by the paper, has been previously reported to be involved in raising funds for Reliance Communications.

 Reliance Communications chairman Anil Ambani said last week that Hutch Essar was a potential takeover target, while worlds largest mobile player Vodafone has also announced its interest in acquiring Hutch Essar.

 JM Morgan Stanley, the Indian subsidiary of the US-based financial major, is an adviser to the Essar group.

 Inflation back above 6%

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, April 20: After a weeks respite, the rate of inflation has again gone above 6 per cent. 

 Wholesale price-based inflation, which fell to 5.74 per cent for the week ended March 31, rose to 6.09 per cent for the week ended April 7 mainly due to a sudden 23 per cent surge in vegetable prices. The rate has stayed above 6 per cent, higher than Reserve Banks tolerance level, for the past two months.

 Reacting to the renewed surge in prices, finance minister P. Chidambaram said containing inflation was high on governments priority list and expected the rate to come down to around 5.7 per cent next week.

 To contain inflation remains a very high priority... And my expectation is it will hover around 5.7 per cent next week, Chidambaram said.

 The unexpected rise in inflation will mount pressure on the RBI to either increase interest rates or take some other steps to moderate money supply in its annual monetary policy on April 24, analysts said.

 I think the RBI will again take measures to tighten liquidity. But it is difficult to predict which instruments they are going to touch. It may be another rate hike or some sort of tightening on external commercial borrowing, Crisil principal economist D. K. Joshi said.

 Controlling inflation will indeed be a priority for the UPA government, particularly since Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh are going on. Price rise was blamed for the Congress Partys loss in Assembly polls in Punjab and Uttarakhand.

 However, moderation in inflation will depend on wheat arrival in the market, which has been delayed by 10 days.

 Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar had earlier said wheat arrival was delayed because farmers had shifted to a new strategy by manually separating straw from wheat, instead of using machines, to maximise their earnings. Straw prices have risen considerably due to demand for cattle feed.

 According to finance ministry sources, there was some glitch in the inflation figure released today. The figure may be later revised downward, they said.

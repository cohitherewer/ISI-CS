 Institutions beat retail in MF rush

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

Calcutta, Aug. 14: The total assets under management (AUM) of mutual funds in the country grew nearly five times to Rs 486,652 crore between June 2003 and July this year. 

 However, the share of institutional investors in the AUM is higher than that of retail investors. Institutional investors, comprising corporate entities, banks and financial institutions, have cornered 49 per cent of the AUM till July, whereas the share of retail investors increased to 42 per cent from 30 per cent during the period.

 Non-resident investors have a 5 per cent share and high net worth individuals 4 per cent. Between 2003 and 2007, the total AUM of mutual funds in the country witnessed a compounded annual growth rate of 44 per cent. Though a larger part of the growth came from institutional investors, there was also an evidence of growing retail participation, said A. P. Kurian, chairman of the Association of Mutual Funds in India. 

 He said the number of mutual fund accounts held by retail investors stood at 3.2 crore.

 Systematic investment plans (SIP) have helped mutuals increase their retail base, particularly in the rural areas. There are now 20 lakh SIP accounts. The number of retail accounts increased by 41 lakh between January and May 2007, with SIP accounting for 15 lakh accounts. A year ago, only 10,000 SIP accounts were registered every month.

 Household taste for shares was also reflected in the statistics of the Reserve Bank of India. In 2005-06, households held 3.6 per cent of their savings in shares and mutual funds against just 0.4 per cent in 2004-05. However, the mutual fund numbers camouflage the extent of retail participation, which is actually lower.

 Anil Chopra, chief executive and director of Bajaj Capital Ltd, said, There may be 3.2 crore retail accounts with mutual funds. But many of these are multiple accounts of the same investor with different mutual funds.

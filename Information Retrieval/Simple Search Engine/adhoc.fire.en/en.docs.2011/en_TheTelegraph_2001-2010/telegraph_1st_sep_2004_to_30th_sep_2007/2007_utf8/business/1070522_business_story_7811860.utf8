 Deccan knocks on Sebi door

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, May 21: Deccan Aviation, which owns Indias largest budget airline Air Deccan, has sought a probe by market regulator Sebi into the sharp rally in its share price during the past week.

 According to sources, the company has written to Sebi to ascertain the reason behind an abnormal movement in the share price. Air Deccans share has gained over 16 per cent in the last one week and nearly 20 per cent in the past one month.

 The scrip rose on speculation that various parties, including Vijay Mallya-promoted Kingfisher Airlines, the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group and some private equity players, were interested in buying a stake in the low-cost carrier.

 This comes on a day when the sensex surged 115.19 points and the rupee hardened as the fears about inflation and interest rates melted in a warm summer of robust corporate numbers.

 Led by the Big Boys of Business Tata Steel and Reliance Industries the 30-share sensex rose to 14418.60 even though 14 of the components lost ground. It was the indexs strongest close since February 9, the day it had hit a record high of 14723.88. 

 The 50-share NSE index gained 1.1 per cent to a record close of 4260.90.

 Shares of RIL rose 3.7 per cent to a third-straight record close. The stock has risen more than 31 per cent since April 3, compared with a 14 per cent rise in the benchmark index during the same period.

 Investors in the companies of the two Ambani brothers Mukesh and Anil wore the broadest smiles as they became richer by about Rs 15,000 crore after todays rally. The combined market value of the seven companies from the two groups rose to over Rs 4,33,000 crore (over $106 billion), from about Rs 4,18,400 crore (Rs 4,184 billion) on Friday. 

 The three companies from the Mukesh camp RIL, Reliance Petroleum and Reliance Industrial Infrastructure leapt by Rs 9,950 crore in their combined market cap to about Rs 2,89,000 crore. 

 In comparison, the companies in the Anil Ambani group Reliance Communications, Reliance Energy and Reliance Natural Resources saw their market value bump up by about Rs 4,800 crore to close at Rs 1,44,200 crore .

 Steel stocks rose after state-run SAIL reported quarterly results way above analysts estimates. Tata Steel gained 5.4 per cent at Rs 622.90, while SAIL closed 4.3 per cent up at Rs 144.85.

 Meanwhile, the rupee closed 40.68 against the dollar after hitting a fresh nine-year high of 40.55 in early trade, following Chinas revision of trading band for yuan versus dollar.

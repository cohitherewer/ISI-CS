 SAMBIT SAHA

 Goenka: Take a call

 Calcutta, Aug. 23: The current turmoil in stock markets seems to have put a brake on the RPG groups capital-raising plans. 

 At least four companies of the Rs 10,000-crore city-based group are planning to tap the capital market to raise resources to fund their expansion.

 RPG Enterprises has now decided to take a call on the fund-raising plan during the third quarter of this year.

 CESC Ltd, the groups flagship, has embarked on a Rs 15,000-crore capex plan for power generation. Saregama, Phillips Carbon Black Ltd (PCBL) and retail arm Spencers are also planning to tap the market.

 PCBL was to take a call on raising money around this time but the recent volatility in the market has affected its plans.

 We are in no hurry. The market condition is not conducive. Why sell cheap when we have time? said Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of the group, while referring to Phillips Carbon Black.

 Goenka told The Telegraph that the group would decide on the capital raising programme in the October-December quarter.

 It does not mean we will hit the market in the next quarter. The companies will take a call on the quantum and instrument in that period, he added.

 The turbulence in the sub-prime housing loan market in the US coupled with the unwinding of yen carry trade has spooked markets the world over and India has been no exception.

 Companies are finding it difficult to price public issues in these choppy markets.

 Recent political uncertainties at the Centre have added to the volatility. 

 In case the UPA government falls, marketmen expect the volatility to increase even further.

 It will be worthwhile to see how many companies, including RPG Enterprises, will be able to brave the market condition then and go for equity-linked issues, a market analyst said.

 This alliance will introduce a category of affordable branded hotels for the discerning Indian traveller looking for the best amenities at reasonable prices, said Shravan Gupta, executive vice-chairman and managing director of Emaar MGF. 

 This joint venture is in line with our hospitality plans, Gupta added. 

 India will be the second major international market for Premier Travel Inn, which is a subsidiary of Whitbread Plc, the largest hospitality company in the UK. 

 Premier Travel Inn has over 480 hotels and more than 32,600 rooms.

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: Honda Motors of Japan plans to launch a premium hatchback in a couple of years. 

 The company today rolled out the new-look Accord. The sedan, which will replace the existing model, is priced between Rs 14.9 lakh and Rs 17.32 lakh across three variants. Honda Siel Cars India (HSCI) plans to sell at least 3,600 units of the car this calendar year.

 We will introduce a premium hatchback over the next two to three years, said Masahiro Takedagawa, president and CEO of Hondas Indian joint venture, HSCI, which is eyeing sales of 1.5 lakh units by 2010. We will definitely introduce a car which will be positioned below the City. It will be between the B and C segments, said another senior official of the company.

 Takedagawa said the premium hatchback would be an all-new car, which is currently under development.

 When asked whether the car is for the Indian market, he said, India will be the leading country, but the car will also be sold in other markets. However, we will consider Indian infrastructure and localisation plans while developing it. 

 Meanwhile, HSCI is likely to decide on its new facility later this month or by mid-February. The company is exploring three locations Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan and will pump in around Rs 2,000-2,500 crore into this plant.

 Construction is most likely to begin by May and the plant is likely to be operational by 2009, said N.K. Goila, vice-president of HSCI.

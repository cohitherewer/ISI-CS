 Crucial meet to end trade deadlock

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Nath: Firm stand

 New Delhi, April 10: Key WTO members, including India, Brazil, the EU and the US will make renewed efforts here this week to take forward the Doha round of talks before the fast track authority of US President George Bush for signing trade deals expires in June.

 At Indias initiative, trade ministers from the Group of Four, representing the interests of both developed and developing countries, will on Thursday try to work out an acceptable framework toward the progress of the talks and find a meeting ground among competing interests.

 Behind-the-scenes discussions have been going on since January, but this will be the first formal meeting since the collapse of the talks in July last year.

 We are hopeful and the very fact that everyone is getting together around the same table is a good sign, commerce secretary Gopal Pillai said.

 Its not that you expect a breakthrough but at least if it moves things forward, you can meet again a week or 10 days later, and set the ball rolling, he said.

 A positive outcome at Thursdays meeting could lead to further rounds of wider ministerial talks in Geneva.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath made it clear to WTO chief Pascal Lamy that India was not interested in rushing through to meet deadlines at the cost of the livelihood of its farmers. 

 Both Brazil and India want the advanced countries to adopt the development content of the Doha round instead of forcing the developing countries to throw their markets open to cheap agricultural and industrial goods from the West.

 However, India has assured the western countries that it would reduce duties on imported wines and spirits in line with WTO rules. 

 During his recent visit, Lamy had emphasised the need to reach an agreement within this year as the special powers given to the US Presidents office to carry out the fast track negotiations at the WTO would expire and would have to be renewed by the Congress.

 The US is being pressed to make deeper cuts in farm subsidies, while the EU is under pressure to reduce farm tariffs further. Developing nations, led by India and Brazil, are being urged to open their markets to more manufactured and farm goods. The countries, however, have not changed their stands, although the EU has moved closer to the India-Brazil position in seeking sharper cut on farm subsidy from the US.

 EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson recently said the clock was now ticking and there was an urgent need to conclude the talks.

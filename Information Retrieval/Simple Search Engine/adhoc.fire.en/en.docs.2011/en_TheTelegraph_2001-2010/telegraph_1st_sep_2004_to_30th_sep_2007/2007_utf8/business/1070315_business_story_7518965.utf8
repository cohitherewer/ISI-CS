 Calcutta, March 14: The steel ministry has proposed quantitative restrictions on the export of iron ore. However, it supported the imposition of Rs 300-per-tonne export duty proposed in the budget.

 There should be a cap on export. Our ministry wants adequate iron ore to be made available to the domestic industry, steel secretary R.S. Pandey said here today.

 He said the steel industry would grow by 11-12 per cent during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan period and the demand for raw materials would increase simultaneously.

 Iron ore is attracting heavy investment in the domestic industry. We want this to remain with us, he added.

 India currently produces 165 million tonnes (mt) of iron ore and fines a year. Of this, 100 mt is exported. 

 In the last five years, exports have increased by more than two-and-a-half times. 

 The mining industry has demanded a rollback of duty saying that China the biggest buyer of Indian iron ore has declined to pay the additional levy. 

 Of the 100 mt of ore exported, 90 mt are fines, which miners say, are not used by the local industry.

 The steel secretary, however, predicted that within five years, 60 per cent of the capacity would be using fines, in line with China.

 If there is a surplus, one has to export. But the surplus should be contained too. There is a study saying India may lose its resources in the next 20 years. We do not want a situation like that, he said.

 Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) chairman S.K. Rungta, who was here along with JSW Steel managing director Sajjan Jindal to attend the second workshop and meeting of the Steel Task Force, said the past growth could not be a yardstick to predict future demand.

 India expects to reach 110 mt steel production from the current 45 mt by 2015.

 Jindal said China has discouraged raw material export by imposing duties. It has also put restrictions on export of semi-finished steel.

 We need to preserve the assets. Imposition of export duty is a step in the right direction, he added.

 He said that given the rise in international price of iron ore, a levy of Rs 300 could be easily absorbed by exporters.

 Respite for battered market

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 6: Bruised investors heaved a sigh of relief today when stock markets rebounded in a relief rally after a 750-point crash in the past two trading sessions. 

 Backed by a turnaround in Asian indices and led by information technology, banking stocks and other heavyweights, the sensex rose 282 points. 

 Equities today began on a positive note after news emerging from Asia offered major relief. Overcoming concerns of the Yen Carry Trade, which impacted these markets yesterday, nearly all of them ended higher. While the Hong Kongs Hang Seng ended up 393.68 points, Japans Nikkei was up by 202.25 points, South Koreas Kospi by 26.78 points and Taiwans weighted index by 106.50 points. 

 Reflecting the good opening in these markets, the benchmark index opened higher and consolidated its gains. Though there were some worrying signs in the late noon when certain gains were reversed, shares again resumed their buying momentum and finally closed in the green. 

 Brokers said a large part of the rally in domestic bourses was in IT stocks. These shares attracted keen buying interest due to a fall in the rupee value against the dollar, which could ensure a substantial rise in the bottomline of IT companies. 

 Analysts added that market participants were also betting on such safe counters as the outlook on many other sectors continued to be grim. 

 In choppy trade, the sensex moved widely in a range of 12760.22 and 12427.13 before ending the day at 12697.09, a net rise of 282.05 points or 2.27 per cent over yesterdays close of 12415.04. The sensex had fallen by 745 points or 5.66 per cent in the preceding two sessions due to global weakness. Similarly, the broader S amp;P CNX Nifty of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) rebounded by 79.15 points or 2.21 per cent to close at 3655.65 from previous close of 3576.50. 

 Apart from IT shares, refinery and banking shares too were in the limelight, having scored impressive gains. The BSE IT index was the largest percentage gainer among all the sectoral indices on the BSE as it jumped by 231.64 points or 4.90 per cent to 4961.94 from previous close of 4730.30. Powering the segment were shares like Infosys and Wipro, which gained by 5.47 per cent and 8.12 per cent, respectively.

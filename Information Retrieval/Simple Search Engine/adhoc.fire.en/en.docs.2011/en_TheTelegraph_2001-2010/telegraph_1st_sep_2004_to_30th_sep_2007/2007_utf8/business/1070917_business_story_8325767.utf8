 DoT dials next-generation networks

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: The department of telecom (DoT) wants telecom operators to switch to Internet-based digital networks to reduce operational costs and offer advanced voice and data services.

 The operators have to move on to next-generation networks (NGNs) or Internet protocol-based digital networks to offer converged voice, data and multimedia services, said officials.

 A focus group under the Telecom Engineering Centre, the technical wing of the DoT, has been set up to supervise the adoption process, they added. The group will also be involved in the approval of funds and expenditure.

 The new technology will enable the operators to provide multimedia, data, voice and video services on the same platform. They use different platforms to offer these services now, which are costly, time-consuming and inefficient, the officials said.

 Next generation networks involve convergence of network infrastructure and services that function over an Internet protocol network. This digital mode is much superior to analogue networks.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India is planning to bring out a consultation paper on the deployment and use of the new network. It will submit its recommendations to the DoT after it receives the industrys comments on the paper. 

 DoT will then formulate rules and regulations for the launch of NGN services, said the officials. 

 NGN rollouts are not regulated now. The universal service access licence permits the deployment and use of the new network. 

 According to DoT, operators all over the world are implementing NGN strategies and are investing billions to roll out IP-based networks. They are using NGN architectures to capitalise on and grow their legacy networks and provide enhanced service packaging and information-intensive services to their end customers, the officials said.

 Bharat Sanchar Nigam has already moved a large chunk of its traffic to NGN. 

 Reliance Communications is also setting up a nationwide next-generation network. Vodfaone-Essar has implemented NGN in its Mumbai and Delhi circles. Bharti Airtel is also moving over to NGN. 

 Alcatel-Lucent is a major supplier of NGN equipment to India. Handset manufacturers Nokia, Siemens, Ericsson and Chinese telecom company ZTE also provide equipment and support to convert to next generation network platform.

 Telecom tussle

 BSNL and MTNL today said regulator Trais direction on opening up domestic leased circuit (DLC) will lead to the hoarding of last mile connections by the private sector, rendering the two PSUs uncompetitive. The PSUs have also not ruled out the possibility of challenging Trais order in the telecom dispute settlement tribunal. 

 Sources said Trais latest regulation on DLC is nothing but a reversal of governments stated principle and policy of not unbundling the local loop and has questioned its jurisdiction on it.

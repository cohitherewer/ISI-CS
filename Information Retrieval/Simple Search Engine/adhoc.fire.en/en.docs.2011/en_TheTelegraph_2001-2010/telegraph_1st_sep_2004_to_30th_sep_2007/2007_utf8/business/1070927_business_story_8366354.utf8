 Stern test for telecom newbies

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: The telecom department will identify serious players through a two-stage screening process before granting licences.

 Availability of spectrum, scrutiny of proxy ownership and weeding out non-serious players will be the main criteria of the two-stage screening process for new unified access licences, said officials. 

 In the first stage of screening, companies will be asked to provide details of promoters, proposed foreign direct investment, funding patterns and net worth of applicants. Based on this information, the DoT will decide if the company is eligible to apply for the licence. 

 In the second stage, the DoT will scrutinise each application for crossholding, if any, said officials. The guidelines will be issued in the first week of October, and the screening of applicants is likely be done from the third week.

 The DoT is planning to raise the net worth criteria of companies applying for a pan-India licence from Rs 1,380 crore to Rs 1,500 crore. The department may also offer spectrum on a first-come-first-served basis to the company that first pays the licence fee.

 The DoT is also planning to reduce the time allowed for operators to convert their letters of intent to licences to less than a week against the current 90-day period. 

 This will help separate serious players from fly-by-night operators, who have entered the fray to make quick money by trading in spectrum, said officials. 

 The DoT suspects that as spectrum is allocated on a first-come-first-served basis, some of the existing players may have placed multiple applications under different names. 

 The Cellular Operators Association of India, a body of GSM operators, had also written to the DoT, expressing concern over some of the new applications.

 It feels these applications are meant to circumvent licence norms, including cross-holding restrictions.

 Following a suggestion by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India to lift the cap on the number of operators in a circle, a number of companies have rushed in for licences.

 The latest to join the fray are real estate players DLF and Indiabulls, who submitted their applications today.

 Earlier, Unitech and Parsvnath, who are also big in realty, have submitted applications.

 Others in line are Ruia-controlled BPL Ltd, Mahendra Nahata-owned HFCL, Reliance ADAG-backed Swan, Cheetah Telecom and S-Tel. 

 More than 160 applications are now pending with the DoT. 

 Companies waiting for fresh spectrum to expand are Aircel, Spice Telecom and Idea Cellular.

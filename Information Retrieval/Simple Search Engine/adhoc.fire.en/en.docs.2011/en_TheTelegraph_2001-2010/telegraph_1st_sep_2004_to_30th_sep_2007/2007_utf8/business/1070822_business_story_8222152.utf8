 China set to beat India in BPO rivalry

 New Delhi, Aug. 21 (PTI): China can overtake India as the most preferred outsourcing destination in the next 3-5 years on the back of an educated workforce coupled with strong government emphasis on the BPO sector, according to a Nasscom study.

 The BPO industry in China is still in its early phases of evolution but it has the potential to develop into a large industry, the study on Tracing Chinas IT Software Services Industry Evolution said.

 The software and services revenues in China are estimated to grow at 22 per cent to reach $28 billion by 2010, including domestic market earnings at over $20 billion, the study said. China has garnered revenues worth $12.3 billion in this sector in 2006.

 Indias IT software and services revenues are likely to reach $50 billion in 2007-08, according to Nasscom. The current industry landscape in China bears some resemblance to the early years of Indian BPO industry. 

 However, systemic weaknesses and comparatively evolved demand and competitive environments are some of the challenges.

 Nasscom also suggested a collaborative partnership between Indian and Chinese companies.

 Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said the Indian expertise in the IT sector combined with the manufacturing dominance of China could be one of the reasons for a partnership.

 Indian BPO exports are mainly serving the US and the UK markets, which together account for over 80 per cent of exports.

 Chinas key export market areas are Japan and Korea, where it has certain inherent linguistic/cultural advantages, the survey said.

 Japan and Korea account for about 60 per cent of exports from China. The share of markets in the US and Europe is growing steadily from 15 per cent in 2003 to about 23 per cent in 2005.

 Chinas exports in software and services space are dominated by application development, coding/testing and localisation services while Indias exports in the same segment include application management, infrastructure services, offshore product development and engineering services.

 However, low usage of English and differences in business culture could come in the way of growth of this sector in China.

 JK Paper profit up

 JK Paper Ltd has posted a 28 per cent increase in profit after tax (PAT) for the second quarter ended December 31, 2006, at Rs 12.18 crore compared with Rs 9.48 crore in the corresponding period previous year. 

 JK Paper managing director Harsh Pati Singhania said the improved performance was a result of significant growth in branded copier and coated paper. Sale of copier paper grew 39 per cent year-on-year and high-end coated paper was up 62 per cent, he added. 

 JK paper vice-president (finance) V. Kumarswamy said the results also reflected the companys increased capacity utilisation along with pulp production balancing and coating plants operations. 

 During the quarter, the companys overall paper production stood at 55,124 tonnes, up 14.6 per cent from the corresponding period a year ago, while total paper sales increased by 22.2 per cent at 57,095 tonnes, he said. 

 The company had increased prices of various segments of products, including pulp in the quarter, Kumarswamy said, adding it may consider another round of price hike by March. Usually, the quantum of increase is Rs 500, Rs 750 and Rs 1,000 per tonne depending on the product and we are looking at a similar increase when we carry out another such exercise, Kumarswamy added.

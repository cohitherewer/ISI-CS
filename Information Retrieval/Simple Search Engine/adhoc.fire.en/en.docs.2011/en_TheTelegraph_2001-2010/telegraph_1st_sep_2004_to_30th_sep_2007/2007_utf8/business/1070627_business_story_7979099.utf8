 Tamil Nadu to import coal for power units

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, June 26: The Tamil Nadu government has said all future thermal power stations in the state will run on imported coal. The decision is expected to reduce the states dependence on Coal Indias Eastern Coalfields.

 Arcont N. Veersawamy, the state electricity minister, said coal imported from Indonesia, Australia or China has a low ash content of 4 per cent to 6 per cent compared with 40 per cent in the domestic type. Hence, imported coal will not increase the cost of production. Veersawamy was speaking at a conference to mark the 50th anniversary of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board. The board has already imported 1.5 million tonnes per annum of coal.

 On July 2, state chief minister M. Karunanidhi will flag off power projects involving an investment of Rs 10,000 crore and having a total capacity of 2,500mw. These include a 500mw thermal power station in north Chennai, a 500mw thermal unit at Mettur, two units of 500mw each at Tuticorin and a 500mw pumped storage hydro-electric project at Kundah in the Nilgiris.

 The state has pinned hopes on Reliances pipeline project to generate power from natural gas. The free supply of power for all farmers will continue, Veersawamy said. The state had rejected the unbundling of the electricity board into separate entities for power generation, transmission and distribution as proposed by the Centre.

 Jetlite weighs overseas flights

 Vancouver, June 10 (pti): Jet Airways is open to the idea of operating its low-cost arm, Jetlite, on international routes in the future. We are studying that aspect.... (and) keeping our minds open. At the moment, Jetlite will operate on domestic sectors, Jet Airways chief Naresh Goyal said on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association here.

 Goyal said if low-cost airlines from the Gulf and Southeast Asia are allowed to operate in India, we can ask the government whether Jetlite could fly abroad. However, now our priority is to see that Jetlite breaks even first, he said.

 Claiming that the financial results of the new carrier are already better, Goyal said, We will definitely break even by next year. He said several Air Sahara aircraft had to be grounded because of technical and engineering problems. Most of these planes would soon start operating and by September 1, the entire fleet of Jetlite will start flying.

 He said governmental clearances, including those from the the registrar of companies, have been received for Jetlite.

 We are now finalising the new logo and the livery of the new carrier, the Jet chief said, but did not elaborate. He said the logo will reflect the new spirit and pride of modern India. 

 Jetlite will operate on a profitable model, like that of Jetstar of Qantas, Southwest Airlines or the low-cost carrier models of AirAsia or AirArabia.

 Packed lunch or dinner will be offered on board and the planes will have a single-class configuration with comfortable seats, Goyal said. He claimed that the reliability of service, comfort and on-time performance will be the touchstones of Jetlite. On whether the two airlines would continue to fly on the same routes, he said work was going on to rationalise routes.

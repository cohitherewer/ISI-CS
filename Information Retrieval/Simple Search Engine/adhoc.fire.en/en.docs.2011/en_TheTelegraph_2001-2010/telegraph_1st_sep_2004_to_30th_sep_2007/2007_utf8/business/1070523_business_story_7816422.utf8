 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 22: State-owned Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited today launched a voice short messaging service in a tie-up with US-based Kirusa Inc, a leading mobile value-added services provider. 

 MTNL fixed line and mobile subscribers will pay Re 1 per minute to send, forward or reply to a voice SMS. They will be able to listen to a message free of charge for the first time and have to pay Re 1 per minute for listening to it again.

 This is the first time that fixed line and mobile subscribers have the option of sending voice SMS to other fixed line or mobile subscribers, said A. K. Arora, executive director, MTNL.

 Inderpal Singh Mumick, founder and CEO, Kirusa, said, While sending a voice SMS a customer can send a message reflecting his emotions. In text messages, this is not possible.

 Bharti, BPL (Mumbai circle), Aircell (Chennai circle), Idea and Reliance (CDMA services) have voice SMS services only for mobile phones.

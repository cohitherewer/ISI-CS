 Jute panel keen to dilute packing norm

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 In a dilemma

 Calcutta, June 1: A jute panel has proposed the dilution of the provision that makes it mandatory for sugar and foodgrain to be packed only in jute bags.

 The standing committee on the Jute Packaging Materials Act 1987 wants the provision to be lowered by 30 per cent in sugar and 25 per cent in foodgrain for the 2007-08 jute year, which is from June 2007 to July 2008.

 The move is likely to hurt the industry as compulsory packaging of sugar and foodgrain required 9 lakh tonnes of jute, which is 70 per cent of the industrys total production of 16 lakh tonnes.

 The committee, headed by Union textile secretary A.K. Singh, feels consumers should have the freedom to choose their packaging materials when there is a disruption in the supply of bags.

 To protect interests of small jute growers, the committee said it has kept the mandatory packaging norm to the extent of 75 per cent for foodgrain and 70 per cent for sugar.

 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees plea to continue using jute for 100 per cent packaging of sugar and foodgrain for the next five years was ignored. The committee has also recommended a further dilution by 20 per cent in case of a disruption in supplies.

 Singh feels the industry has enjoyed the protection for too many years and is still unable to stand on its feet. Nearly 20 years of protection and regulation has not elevated the jute industry from its position of technological obsolescence, inefficiency in production and irregular quality of products. Poor management-labour relationship is resulting in frequent strikes.

 The committee comprises officials of the food, agriculture and petrochemicals ministries and representatives of jute and foodgrain producing states, including Bengal.

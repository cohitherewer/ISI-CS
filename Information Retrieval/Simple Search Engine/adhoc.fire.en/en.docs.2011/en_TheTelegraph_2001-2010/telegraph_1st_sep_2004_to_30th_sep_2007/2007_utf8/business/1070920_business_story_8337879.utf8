 Go-slow on wheat import 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The government has decided to go slow on wheat import and keep watch on international market prices.

 Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar today said since the government had adequate stocks to meet domestic demand, there was no hurry to make new purchases. 

 There is no immediate need to acquire more wheat but if there is any such requirement in the future, then the policy will be reviewed, Pawar added.

 After scrapping a tender in which bidders quoted $263 a tonne, the government decided to import over 13 lakh tonnes at a price between $325 and $390 per tonne. 

 The decision to import at a higher price was criticised by the BJP and the Left. The government had announced plans to import 50 lakh tonnes of wheat this year.

 The government also plans to hike the procurement price to over Rs 1,000 per quintal so that farmers get reasonable rates. Domestic rates remained stable against soaring international prices. 

 In Delhi, average quality wheat was sold at Rs 10,300 per tonne. However, prices could rise next month because of seasonal demand.

 The government has no plans to procure wheat from private traders, Pawar added. 

 He said he didnt want to disturb domestic prices by purchasing from the open market as it would affect consumers.

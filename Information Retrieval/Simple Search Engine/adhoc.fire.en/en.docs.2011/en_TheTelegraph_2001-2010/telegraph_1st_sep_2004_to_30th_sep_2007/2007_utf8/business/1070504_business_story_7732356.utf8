 Take-off signal for airport regulator

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Das Munshi: Speaking out

 New Delhi, May 3: The Union cabinet tonight cleared a proposal to put in place an economic regulator for airports.

 The Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA), to be set up through a bill in Parliament, will fix, review and approve the tariff structure for aeronautical services and monitor pre-set performance standards at airports.

 However, the air force, navy and the army will not come under the purview of the authority, information and broadcasting minister P.R. Das Munshi told reporters here after the cabinet meeting.

 The necessity for a regulator was being felt as several privately run airports had come up while the two biggest airports Delhi and Mumbai had been privatised. The AERA is expected to set quality standards and ensure a level-playing field for all airport operators in the country.

 At present, it is the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) who looks after all the regulatory functions. The Naresh Chandra committee had proposed an economic regulator for the entire aviation sector that would take over DGCAs activities and would function as a quasi-judicial body. However, the civil aviation ministry was not happy with this idea and preferred a regulator just for airports. The draft AERA bill proposes that the authority will determine the tariff structure for aeronautical services.

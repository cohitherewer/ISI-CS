 Public sector gas to be costlier

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Coming at a price

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: The government plans to raise the price of gas sold by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Oil India Limited before the next round of bidding for gasfields.

 A petroleum ministry note, which is with the power and fertiliser ministries, proposes a rise in the price of ONGC gas to Rs 3,600 per thousand standard cubic metres from Rs 3,200. Power and fertiliser companies buy the gas from the two PSUs under the administered pricing mechanism.

 The price of Oil India gas, from its fields in the Northeast, could be raised to over Rs 4,000 per thousand standard cubic metres. Oil Indias prices are higher because the gas is in remote regions, which make transportation expensive.

 Government officials said both power and fertiliser companies and their administrative ministries were unhappy, because gas prices were raised a few months ago.

 The government decides the gas prices of the ONGC and OIL as they were awarded to the PSUs on a nomination basis.

 The petroleum ministrys move follows the governments endorsement of Reliance Industries formula for the gas from the companys fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin.

 Earlier, fertiliser minister Ram Vilas Paswan had said higher gas prices would further bloat fertiliser subsidies.

 However, the officials said a hike was necessary because the current prices were too low. 

 The ONGC, too, had been complaining of losses from the low realisations.

 At the proposed higher price, the PSU will break even at its old fields. It will make losses from its new fields because of high investment outlays.

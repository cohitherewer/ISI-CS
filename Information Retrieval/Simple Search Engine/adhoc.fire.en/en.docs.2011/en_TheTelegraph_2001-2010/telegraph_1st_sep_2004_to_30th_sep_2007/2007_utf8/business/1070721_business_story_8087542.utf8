 Tata Steel sets rights issue date

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 20: Tata Steels rights issue will hit the market in November.

 The private sector steel major plans to offer one equity share for every five held at Rs 300, raising Rs 3,655 crore to part-finance the Corus buy.

 The company expects to raise the funds for the $12.9-billion deal by March next year. 

 Koushik Chatterjee, vice-president (finance) of Tata Steel, told The Telegraph that the price of the rights issue would remain as promised even if it was at a deep discount to the current market price. We intend to bring out the issue in November. Even as the price is at a deep discount to the current rate of Rs 714, the company will stick to it keeping the groups policy in mind, he added.

 However, the cumulative convertible preference (CCP) issue may be tweaked a bit, he said. We have not frozen on the convertibles. The board will take a call, Chatterjee, who was one of the masterminds behind the financing of Indias biggest overseas acquisition, said.

 Tata Steel had said the conversion price could be in the range of Rs 500-600 within 18-34 months from the date of allotment. There was also a provision that the conversion could be done at a higher price. Given the buoyancy in the stock market, the conversion price should be higher.

 Tata Steel will garner at least Rs 4,350 crore or a bigger amount if the conversion takes place at a higher price through the CCP issue.

 The CCP issue will also be offered to existing shareholders on an ex-right basis.

 Tata Steel is also planning an issue in the domestic or international market for $500 million (Rs 2,042 crore) in one or more currencies and tranches.

 The company will seek shareholders approval on the issue at the 100th annual general meeting on August 27, 2007. Chatterjee also said Tata Steel would save a lot because of the rupees appreciation against the dollar and the changes in the exchange rate between the dollar and pound sterling.

 We will announce the quantum of gain when we come out with the first-quarter results, he said.

 Tata Steel will come out with its first-quarter results on July 30.

 SEZ panel set to vet 41 proposals

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 11: The commerce ministrys board of approval will consider 41 proposals for special economic zones (SEZs) tomorrow. These include Videocons biotechnology project in Siliguri, Mukesh Ambani-promoted Navi Mumbai SEZ, Hindalcos aluminium zone in Sambalpur and the multi-product zone in Chhindwara.

 The board meeting is being held within a week of the parliamentary standing committee asking the government to put a freeze on the notification of SEZs.

 The board is headed by commerce secretary G. K. Pillai.

 Videocon proposes to set up a biotechnology and food processing zone in Siliguri, the foundation stone for which was laid last month. Hindalco wants to set up an aluminium SEZ at Sambalpur in Orissa.

 Other SEZ proposals include those of Unitech, Parsvnath, Indian Foundary Association, Skil Infrastructure, Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Ltd and Chhindwara Plus Developers Ltd. 

 The Indian Foundary Associations project at Howrah plans to cover 101 hectares. 

 Parsvnath Developers wants to set up a biotechnology SEZ in Andhra Pradesh covering over 10 hectares, while Unitech Realty will set up an information technology SEZ at Gurgaon in Haryana.

 The Navi Mumbai SEZ proposal was deferred twice on issues such as protection of villagers rights that were raised by the revenue department. The Maharashtra government has now given the project a clean chit.

 Undue haste in approving SEZs and their proliferation has contributed to the resistance against the policy. There is an imperative need to understand the cause of farmers agitation and grievance, the parliamentary standing committee had said.

 Of the 41 proposals, 31 require formal clearance while the others are coming for in-principle sanction. 

 So far 339 enclaves have been given formal approval and 162 in-principle nod. Out of the 339 approved ones, 127 have been notified.

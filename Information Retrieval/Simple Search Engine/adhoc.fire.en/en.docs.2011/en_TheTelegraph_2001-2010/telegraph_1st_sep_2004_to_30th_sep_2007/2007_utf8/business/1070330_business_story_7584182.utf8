 Calcutta, March 29: Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) plans to take the joint venture route to develop two mines at Tilabani and Madhujore in Bengal. ECL will hold a 75 per cent stake in the venture.

 We are already in talks with Walter Mining of Australia to determine the feasibility of developing the two mines with a capacity of 5 million tonnes (mt) each, ECL CMD Deepak Chakravarti said. We have the largest underground coal mine at Jhanjra with a capacity of 1 mt a year, he added.

 Tilabani and Madhujore have proven coal reserves of 150 mt each. The expected investment in each of these mines would be $400 million, the ECL chairman said. According to him, ECL will put in $300 million equity to develop each of these mines, while $100 million (in each case) will be contributed by the joint venture partner by supplying moving equipment for coal mining.

 Though we in talks with Walter Mining, well have to float a global tender for joint venture partners, said Chakravarti. The mines will come up by 2011-12, he added. 

 ECL has earmarked an investment of Rs 2,300 crore over the next five years to ramp up its production. The Coal India subsidiary produced 30.50 mt of coal this fiscal compared with 31.11 mt in the previous year. Our production decreased this year because we had to almost stop production at Rajmahal for the last two months as NTPC didnt lift the amount of coal it was supposed to. Following this, the pit head stock at Rajmahal piled up to 4.2 mt, Chakravarti said.

 ECL has got government clearance to set up two greenfield open cast mines at Hura and Chuperbita having a capacity of 3 mt and 4 mt respectively.

 It also plans to increase the capacity at its Sonepur Bazari open cast mine in Raniganj to 8 mt from 3 mt. Besides, the production capacity at Chitra open cast mine in Salanpur area will also be increased to 2.5 mt from 1.2 mt.

 ECL reported a profit of Rs 100 crore for the current financial year. It made a turnaround in 2005-06 with a net profit of Rs 363.86 crore.

 Coal India is expected to clock Rs 8,000 crore profit during the current fiscal, Chakravarti said.

 Calcutta, July 18: Texmaco has formed a 50:50 joint venture with LMJ International Ltd to set up a food park. The park, which will require an investment of over Rs 1,000 crore, will come up on Texmacos 140-acre plot in Sankrail.

 It will house food processing units and a laboratory.

 Food processing is a leading industry in Bengal. We will set up this park with our partners who have an expertise in this field. The joint venture company can acquire more land if required, said S.K. Poddar, executive vice-chairman of Texmaco.

 The company is also in talks with international players such as US-based Trinity Industries and other firms from Asia Pacific and Europe for technical collaboration to manufacture new generation freight cars.

 The partner will be finalised in the next three to four months, said Ramesh Maheshwari, president and CEO of Texmaco.

 In another six months, Texmaco will also finalise the partner for manufacturing metro coaches. 

 Most of the coaches are now imported. 

 The companys capital expenditure in the next two years will be Rs 200 crore. It will ramp up its foundry capacity from 15,000 tonnes to 25,000 tonnes in a year.

 For the quarter ended June 30, the company posted gross sales of Rs 192.26 crore compared with Rs 105.36 crore in the year-ago period. 

 The companys net profit jumped from Rs 4.47 crore to Rs 11.36 crore.

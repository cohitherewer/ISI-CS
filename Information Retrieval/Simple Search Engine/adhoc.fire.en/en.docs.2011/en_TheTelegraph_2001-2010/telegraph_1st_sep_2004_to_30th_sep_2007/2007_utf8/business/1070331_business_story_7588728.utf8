 Deep divide on Nipo stake

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 FLAVOUR PICK 

 Calcutta, March 30: Confusion clouds Tata Teas bid to invite workers to pick up stakes in its divested North Indian Plantation Operations (Nipo). While the four labour unions in Bengal claim to have rejected the proposal, the Assam Cha Mazdoor Sangha, the major union in Assam, has dismissed such concerns as false rumours. It has given the go-ahead to the workers to participate voluntarily.

 Three of the four Bengal unions plan to hold garden gate meetings at the four Tata Tea estates. They also intend to distribute pamphlets and posters to increase awareness about the proposed worker participation scheme and hold talks with the workers to help them decide.

 Our objections arise from the clauses offered by Tata Tea. As soon as a worker becomes an employee shareholder, he/she will have to shoulder the financial burden. Such workers will not be eligible for gratuity and bonus as they become employers. They will cease to have their rights as workmen under the Industrial Disputes Act, which is not acceptable. We have, therefore, rejected their proposal and would look at various channels like garden gate meetings and posters and pamphlets to get our point of view across to the workers, said Bablu Mukherjee, secretary of National Union of Plantation Workers, which has 1,000 to 1,200 members mainly in the Batabari and Rungamuttee estates of Tata Tea.

 This comes at a time when the lockout at the companys Borjan estate in Assam, where similar divestment notification was given and alternative revenue generation activity piloted, is on the verge of reopening any day now, said M.S. Khandait, general secretary of Assam Cha Mazdoor Sangha. The concerns about gratuity and bonus are just rumours being spread to create trouble. We have given our workers permission to go ahead if they want, Khandait said.

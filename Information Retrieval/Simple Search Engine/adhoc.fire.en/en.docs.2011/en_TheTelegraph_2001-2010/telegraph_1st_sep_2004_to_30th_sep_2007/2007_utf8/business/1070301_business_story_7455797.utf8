 Cess hike to feed backward quota

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: The Union finance minister today levied an extra 1 per cent cess on all existing taxes, partly to fund the implementation of the 27 per cent other backward classes quota in central institutions of higher education.

 The move, which takes the education cess to 3 per cent, was part of a range of budget proposals on the sector, from boosting school enrolment and checking the high dropout rate to upgrading vocational training.

 I have a proposal regarding the cess for education. While the cess of 2 per cent on all taxes to fund basic education will remain, I propose to levy an additional cess of 1 per cent on all taxes to fund secondary education and higher education and the expansion of capacity by 54 per cent for reservation for socially and educationally backward classes, P. Chidambaram told Parliament. 

 The budget, which raised the overall allocation in education by 34 per cent, tried to tackle a problem that has so far proved intractable the high school dropout rate, mostly after Class VIII, which Chidambaram dubbed the critical year.

 The budget has proposed an annual scholarship of Rs 6,000 for students who continue to study beyond Class VIII, depending on their merit and their families means. One lakh students, chosen through a national-level test every year, will receive the scholarship for four years till Class XII.

 The scholarship will be funded by a Rs 750-crore corpus, to be built over the next three years and placed with the State Bank of India.

 The finance minister claimed that the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan had raised enrolment in schools to 96 per cent, and allocated Rs 10,671 crore under the programme.

 To hand a fillip to vocational training, some 1,360 Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) will be upgraded to centres of excellence. So will be G.B. Pant University of Agriculture amp; Technology, Pantnagar, and Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.

 The government has been criticised for spending less than 3 per cent of GDP on education even though the ruling alliances common minimum programme pledges 6 per cent of the GDP to the field. This budget looks to close the gap.

 Many educators, however, believe that more money for education does not necessarily mean better results, because the success of the schemes depends on the delivery system on the ground.

 Memory money

 The 150th anniversary of the 1857 revolt and the centenary of the Satyagraha found mention and the promise of money in the budget.

 Our thoughts go to the institutions that continue the work of Gandhiji and other constructive work, Chidambaram said, earmarking Rs 30 crore.

 The four institutions that share it include Sabarmati Ashram and Sevagram Ashram (Wardha), both linked to the Mahatma. The other two are the Rajendra Smriti Sangrahalya in Patna, home to late President Rajendra Prasad, and the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune.

 Also, Rs 20 crore will be spent on the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library in Delhi to reposition it as a major centre of intellectual activity. The revolt anniversary is worth Rs 10 crore.

 Long queue for mobile licence

 JAYATI GHOSE

 Call for all

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: A number of telecom and non-telecom players have queued up to obtain mobile licences as the defence ministry plans to vacate more spectrum.

 Realty firm Parsvnath Developers and Oswal Chemicals amp; Fertilizers applied for a pan-India licence in the last week of August, while Mumbais BPL Mobile Communications applied on Thursday for 21 fresh universal access service licences. Many more are expected to be filed this week. 

 Global operators AT amp;T and Deutsche Telekom AG are also interested in bidding for new GSM licences but have not put in applications because of the absence of a formal spectrum policy, said industry insiders.

 The rush for licences seems to have followed the telecom regulators recent suggestion that there should be no cap on the number of operators in a circle, said a DoT official. Trais recommendations are under consideration and a final verdict is expected soon, he added. 

 Apart from fresh applications by existing telecom firms such as HFCL, Spice Telecom, Tata Tele and Idea, a growing number of players with no prior telecom exposure such as Alliance Infratech, Swan Telecom and Cheetah Corporate Services have also applied for fresh licences.

 The countrys growing telecom sector has 136 operators, 22 licensees and over 160 applicants for the 22 telecom circles.

 Telecom analysts said another factor responsible for the demand is 2G spectrum. Since 2G radio frequencies on which mobile services operate is allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis, companies are vying with each other to be on top of the list, said Sudipto Basu, senior analyst with EXL. Prospective players believe that joining the queue will guarantee spectrum.

 Following a meeting with the DoT on Friday, the ministry of defence had decided to vacate around 5Mhz of second generation (2G) radio frequency for the Delhi and Mumbai circles by next month.

 By January 2008, defence forces will vacate 10-15MHz of 2G spectrum varying from circle to circle and another 10 MHz by April 2008.

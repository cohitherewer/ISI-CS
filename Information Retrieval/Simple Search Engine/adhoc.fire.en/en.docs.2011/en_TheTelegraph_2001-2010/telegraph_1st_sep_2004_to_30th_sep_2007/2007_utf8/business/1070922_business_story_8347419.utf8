The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Market party in full swing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, Sept. 21: The partys on at Jeejeebhoy Towers the sensex closed at a new peak of 16564.23, a gain of 216.28 points. Heavyweights such as Reliance Industries (RIL) hogged the limelight and positive news on inflation boosted sentiments further. 

 The market began on a flat note, but sentiments improved after inflation data came in. A fall in the rate to 3.32 per cent for the week ended September 8 led to hopes that the RBI could lower interest rates.

 Reliance Petroleum, Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) and Reliance Energy saw brisk buying. Brokers said market capitalisation of RNRL soared after news poured in that it planned to enter city gas distribution in Mumbai, Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida. 

 Shares of RIL were in demand after reports came in of yet another oil find in the Krishna-Godavari basin. The RIL scrip touched a life-time high of Rs 2,294.

 The index touched a low of 15308.09 but mid-session buying pushed it to a new intra-day peak of 16616.84 before closing at 16564.23, a rise of 1.32 per cent over yesterdays 15347.95. The Nifty crossed the 4800-mark to end at 4837.55.

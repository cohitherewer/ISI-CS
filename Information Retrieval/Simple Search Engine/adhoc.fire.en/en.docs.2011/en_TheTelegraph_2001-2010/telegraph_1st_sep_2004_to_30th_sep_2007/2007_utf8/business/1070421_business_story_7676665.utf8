 Wipro net grows 39% to Rs 856 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 20: Wipro, the countrys third-largest software services exporter, today beat Street estimates to post a 39 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net profit. 

 Consolidated net profit rose to Rs 856.1 crore from Rs 617.9 crore in the corresponding previous period. 

 Revenue also jumped 39 per cent to Rs 4,333 crore from Rs 3,113.2 crore in the same period last year. 

 The strong performance, attributed to higher rates and more orders, came amid apprehensions among analysts that the rupee appreciation may hit the companys performance during the period. 

 Net profit for the full year increased 42 per cent to Rs 2,942 crore from Rs 2,067.4 crore in the corresponding period a year ago, while total revenues rose from Rs 10,625.8 crore to Rs 15,000.8 crore. 

 Wipro said a rise in billing rates and improved profits from the business process outsourcing (BPO) operations helped it weather the impact of onsite wage increases and adverse exchange rate movement. 

 We have had a good year in 2006-07, chairman Azim Premji said. All business segments contributed to the strong growth in revenues and profits, he added. 

 In the fourth quarter, Wipro won 43 new clients, of which 35 were from the US alone, officials said. In the financial year, the company won 10 outsourcing orders, each worth over $50 million. 

 During the year, we completed strategic acquisitions, expanded local sales foot-print, built deeper domain skills and sharpened our account management focus. We enhanced our global delivery capabilities through centres in Romania, Brazil and Portugal, Premji said. 

 Wipro has forecast that for the quarter ending June 2007, its revenue from the global IT services business would be around $711 million. 

 During the quarter ended March 2007, the companys revenues were at $690.7 million ahead of its guidance of $685 million.

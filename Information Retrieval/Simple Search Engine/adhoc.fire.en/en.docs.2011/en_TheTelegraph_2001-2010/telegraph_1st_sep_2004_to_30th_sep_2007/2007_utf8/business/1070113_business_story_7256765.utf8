 Hindujas ready to buy all of Hutch

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 12: The Hindujas are firmly in the race to acquire Hutchison Essar (Hutch Essar). 

 The group has submitted a non-binding bid to acquire the 67 per cent stake held by Hutchison Telecom International Ltd (HTIL) and it will start a two-day due diligence exercise on January 24.

 The group will submit its final bid after the due diligence exercise. It believes that it is the frontrunner in the race that pits them against Vodafone Group Plc, the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (R-ADAG) and the Ruias of the Essar group who hold 33 per cent in the company.

 At a late evening press conference here today, G. P. Hinduja, president of the Hinduja Group, Ashok Hinduja, chairman of Hinduja Group India, and other senior executives said the group was interested in obtaining at least a majority stake (51 per cent) in Hutch Essar and it would be open to acquiring the entire 100 per cent in Indias fourth largest cellular company.

 We are willing to buy their (the Ruias) stake if they are willing to sell, said G.P. Hinduja, who did not reveal the enterprise valuation they were putting on Hutch Essar. He was equally reticent when asked how they planned to finance the bid.

 He said all the suitors would have put in their bids by the end of this month after which HTIL is expected to call a board meeting to decide on the process. Hinduja said he expected HTIL to wrap up the sale by the end of next month.

 They may have joined the race late, but the Hindujas are confident they can pull it off. 

 We are better placed than anybody else. We do not face any restrictions, said Ashok Hinduja. For instance, HTIL cannot sell more than 10 per cent of its stake to three Indian companies that include Bharti Airtel, the Tatas and the R-ADAG. On the other hand, Vodafone investment is subject to the limits on foreign direct investment (FDI) in the telecom sector.

 He expressed confidence that HTIL would prefer to pick a bidder who would pose no problems to a smooth stake sale.

 Moreover, the Hindujas have the advantage of working with both Hutchison Whampoa and the Ruias. It is we who brought them (Hutchison) here, said a senior group executive.

 Abin K Das, vice-chairman of Hinduja Group India, said prior to selling their 5.11 per cent stake in Hutch Essar to HTIL last year, the group had offered to buy HTILs entire stake in the joint venture. As HTIL was not keen on parting with its holding, the Hindujas sold their minority stake in the company. 

 It is learnt that the Hindujas had reached an understanding at that time under which HTIL promised to consider the Hindujas should they sell their majority stake in the venture.

 Prabal Banerji, group president, finance amp; group chief financial officer, said the group would not face any problem in financing the deal. We will look at a combination of both internal accruals and debt, he said.

 McKinsey stays upbeat

 New Delhi, May 6 (PTI): India has emerged as the top country where companies view the maturing domestic capital markets as a growth opportunity and are not deterred by the risks related to rising expectations from investors.

 According to a survey by global consultant McKinsey, 77 per cent of CEOs and other senior executives globally and 76 per cent in India said this process was affecting the way their companies operate. 

 However, it was only in India and Latin America where executives see the advantages outweighing the pressure of rising expectations.

 Indians are more bullish, with nearly 60 per cent of the respondents saying the changes in the capital markets provided business opportunities against 45 per cent who said their companies faced pressure from rising expectations from this trend. 

 In comparison, nearly 40 per cent of the executives in Latin America shared similar bullish sentiments against 33 per cent who saw the sophistication process as a risk because of rising performance expectations. 

 However, the sophistication process, which includes technology advancement as well as growing product portfolio through introduction of products like overseas investment instruments, has also increased the regulatory burden of the companies. 

 A total of 24 per cent of the respondents from India said their regulatory burden had increased, although it was much larger at 39 per cent across the world. 

 India also came on top of the tally in terms of improved transparency and easier fund raising opportunities that have emerged because of the changes in capital markets. 

 About 48 per cent of the Indian executives said the performance of their companies had become more transparent, while 49 per cent said it had become easier for them to source capital against the global average of 32 per cent and 30 per cent respectively.

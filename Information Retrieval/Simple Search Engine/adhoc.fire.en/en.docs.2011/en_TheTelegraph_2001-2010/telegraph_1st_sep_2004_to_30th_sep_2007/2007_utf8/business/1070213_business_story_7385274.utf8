 Excise cut on crude sought

 Deora: Demand draft

 New Delhi, Feb. 12 (PTI): Petroleum minister Murli Deora has asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for a Re 1 per litre excise duty cut on crude oil to enable a reduction in auto fuel prices. This is necessary to contain inflation.

 Deora has written to Singh and finance minister P. Chidambaram stating that the rise in international oil prices this month has seen an erosion of gain on diesel sales. 

 Oil firms are suffering a loss of 30-35 paise a litre on the sale of this auto fuel, a top official said.

 The hardening of international oil prices, which has seen the Indian basket of crude rise from $51.74 a barrel in the second fortnight of January to $56.18 this month, has also reduced the profit made on petrol from Rs 3.50 a litre to less than Rs 2 a litre.

 For a very brief period, oil companies made a profit of about 50 paise a litre on diesel but it has evaporated. There is a loss on diesel sale, leaving no scope of price reduction unless the government decides to cut excise duty, the official said.

 If Deoras request is heeded, petrol price can be cut by Rs 2 per litre and that of diesel by Re 1 per litre, the official added. The current excise duty on diesel is 8.16 per cent plus Rs 3.32 a litre the two together translating into a total levy of Rs 4.98 per litre. Last year, excise duty on diesel was Rs 3.41 per litre. 

 Revenues from excise duty on diesel have increased to Rs 24,214 crore in 2005-06 from Rs 16,338 crore a year ago. 

 Revenue on diesel as a percentage of total excise revenues has increased to 22 per cent from 16 per cent.

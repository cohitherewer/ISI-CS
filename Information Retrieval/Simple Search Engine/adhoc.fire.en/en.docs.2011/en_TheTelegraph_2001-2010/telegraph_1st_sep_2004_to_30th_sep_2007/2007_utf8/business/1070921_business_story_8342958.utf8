 Sugar mills await subsidy sweetener 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: The agriculture ministry is planning to extend domestic freight subsidy to sugar mills for a year. 

 Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar said, We have surplus sugar stock. We have to see to it that mills get enough support to export this stock.

 Pawar will consult the commerce ministry on providing export subsidy to sugar companies as some countries have objected to it and the matter has been referred to the WTO.

 Trade experts expect India, the worlds second-biggest producer, to export 1.5 million tonnes of white sugar and about 500,000 tonnes of raw sugar by end-September.

 Demand for sugar in India, the worlds second-biggest consumer, is 19-20 million tonnes annually.

 India is likely to produce a record 29 million tonnes during the season that ends in September. According to the International Sugar Organization, the figure could be 33.5 million tonnes for the whole of 2007-08.

 Pawar had earlier said the government would also allow ethanol production from sugarcane and provide monetary incentives to sugar mills to help them pay cane producers. Ethanol is now produced from molasses only. 

 Pawar added that the recent increase in grain prices was because of a mismatch in demand and supply. 

 Earlier this year, the government banned new wheat and rice futures contracts to tame rising prices. 

 The minister said the government should buy food grains from the open market for distribution under the social welfare schemes.

 Clampdown on moneylenders 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, July 24: The hooks are being put out to tame the loan sharks.

 A committee formed by the Reserve Bank of India today came out with a comprehensive set of proposals to tame moneylenders who charge usurious rates and have been blamed for the spate of farmer suicides in states such as Andhra Pradesh.

 The committee recommended that all states should enact legislation that would require money lenders to register with the authorities and fix the maximum rate of interest that they could charge.

 It also asked states to allow banks to appoint individuals who would lend to borrowers, to prevent moneylenders from charging high rates of interest to poor borrowers.

 Interest rates charged by such lenders range between 12 per cent to 150 per cent and many poor farmers commit suicide every year as they cannot repay their debts.

 The committee suggested a model legislation for states that had no enactment as yet, which would also help those which had feeble laws to tweak them.

 The model legislation proposed: 

 a simple and hassle-free

 procedure for compulsory registration, and a periodical

 renewal, of moneylenders; 

 a simplified dispute

 resolution mechanism to ensure better enforcement; 

 the adoption of

 the rule of damdupat which exists in five

 states, including West Bengal restricting the maximum

 amount of interest chargeable by the moneylender; and 

 periodical fixing

 of the maximum rate of interest in line with market

 rates. 

 The committee also explored the establishment of a link between the formal and informal credit providers, whereby a moneylender could serve as an additional credit delivery channel for the formal sector, provided there were safeguard measures.

 The suggestions are being made against a backdrop of dismal statistics: out of every Rs 1,000 debt taken on by farmer households in the country, Rs 257 is sourced from moneylenders

 According to a survey by IIMS Dataworks and Invest India Economic Foundation, the share of moneylenders in the total debt of households in the past two years is estimated at about 31 per cent.

 The penetration of money lenders is significant even in states that are regarded as being adequately banked, such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

 The committee, chaired by a former central bank legal adviser, included senior central bank officials and finance secretaries from 14 states. Set up in May 2006, the committee undertook a survey in 177 districts across 25 states. The committee has asked individual states to fix a ceiling on interest rates charged by moneylenders benchmarked to a particular rate. This rate can be changed on a periodic basis.

 It has also proposed setting up of adequate dispute settlement mechanisms and has recommended penalising unregistered money lenders.

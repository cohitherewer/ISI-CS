 Cash hunt weighs on ICICI scrip

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 30: Shares of ICICI Bank plummeted on the stock exchanges on concerns that its huge equity offering will lead to a lower return on equity for the next couple of years. 

 The share was hammered to Rs 865.90 on the BSE, a fall of 7.26 per cent or Rs 67.75 over the last close. 

 On the National Stock Exchange, the shares ended at Rs 865.85, a fall of Rs 69.30 over the previous close. 

 On Saturday, ICICI Bank announced that it would raise Rs 20,000 crore through a combination of domestic issue and American depository shares. 

 This is the largest capital raising programme by an Indian company. 

 Analysts estimate that the issuance will lead to an equity dilution of around 23 per cent, which in turn could affect its earnings over the next couple of years. 

 The markets were also worried about the growing gross non-performing assets of the bank. 

 Market circles said apart from ICICI Bank, shares of others banks also witnessed a selling pressure during intra-day trading due to different reasons. 

 This was because of apprehensions of increased capital requirements under the revised guidelines announced by the Reserve Bank of India last week.

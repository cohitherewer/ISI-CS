 Wine row fails to dampen spirits 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 HIGH HOPES

 New Delhi, May 26: India hopes to resolve the wine issue amicably despite the offensive at the WTO by the US and the European Union.

 A senior commerce ministry official said, It will take at least six months for the WTO hearings to be completed and we hope to have the necessary legislation in place to bring down duties on wine and spirits much earlier than that.

 Senior officials said the US move to intensify the dispute was a pressure tactic to urge India to take an immediate action.

 The Indian government is likely to move a bill in Parliament to lower customs duty on imported wines and spirits. This will also pave the way for cheaper retail prices in the domestic market. 

 The finance ministry is expected to draw up a proposal, which will soon be taken to the cabinet for approval. 

 The proposed legislation is expected to retain the basic customs duty but scrap the additional levy. 

 It would also make it mandatory for all states to impose excise duty on imported liquor equivalent to that levied on domestic wines and spirits to bring them on an equal footing. 

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath has already told the EU that certain legislative issues need to be sorted out first before the duty on imported wines and spirit could be lowered. 

 However, the EU does not want to leave anything to chance. Nath also brought up the issue of Indian whisky not being treated on a par with European whisky but the US and the EU refused to budge on the issue. 

 According to them, European whisky is made from grain while Indian whisky is distilled from molasses. Hence, they cannot be treated as the same.

 An executive of a leading liquor manufacturing group said, The West should accept our whisky and we are willing to print the fact that it is made from molasses. They should give us a level-playing field.

 Vijay Mallya had also said the West should accept Indian whisky.

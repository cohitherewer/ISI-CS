 Emerging markets hold key

 New Delhi, March 11 (PTI): The government has asked exporters to tap emerging markets and assured them of help in reducing transaction costs.

 Presiding over the fourth meeting of the board of trade, commerce minister Kamal Nath emphasised the need to look at Africa and the Caribbean countries, CIS, including the Russian Federation, and some of the east Asian countries that were witnessing an economic surge.

 If we do not occupy the space now, somebody else will, he said while urging the exporters to make all out efforts to penetrate non-traditional markets.

 Nath said trade facilitation measures would receive the highest priority as a means of reducing transaction cost in order to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian exports.

 Procedural irritants facing exporters would be removed, he said.

 In the discussions, the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (Fieo) demanded that to remove uncertainty among exporters, frequent changes in duty neutralisation schemes should be done away with. 

 All existing schemes in the current five-year foreign trade policy should be allowed to run their course, it said.

 On farm exports too, exporters wanted that policy should be stable as frequent changes hurt.

 President of Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry Habil Khorakhiwala expressed concern over the decline in share of labour intensive sectors in the countrys exports and said labour law flexibility could address this problem to some extent. 

 Exporters were critical of the imposition of services tax and minimum alternate tax in the budget, saying it would erode their competitiveness. They urged the commerce minister to take up the issue with the finance minister.

 The Export Promotion Council for EOUs and SEZs urged the removal of the sunset clause under Section 10-b of the income tax act for 100 per cent EOUs as these units were contributing significantly to exports and employment generation.

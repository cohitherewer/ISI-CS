 Two in race for Avaya

 New York, June 4 (Reuters): Private-equity firms TPG Capital LLP and Silver Lake Partners are in a leading position to buy telecommunications equipment company Avaya Inc for about $17 per share, The Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Monday.

 The deal could break down or Avaya could fall into the hands of another suitor, such as Canadas Nortel Networks Corp, the journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

 Silver Lake declined to comment. Neither TPG nor Avaya could immediately be reached.

 Avayas small size compared with rivals such as Cisco Systems Inc has long made the company a subject of takeover speculation. 

 Such talks intensified last week, helping lift the stock to its best level since 2005, after Avaya postponed an investor conference.

 The company, with about $5 billion in annual revenue, provides equipment for Web-based telephone calls. Its stock closed Friday at $16.08.

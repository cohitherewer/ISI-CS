 Sebi seeks views on mutuals entry load

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 22: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has sought industrys views on a proposal to waive the entry load that mutual funds charge investors who submit their applications directly to the relevant asset management company(AMC).

 The waiver will also apply to applications received through the Internet, collection centre or investor service centres. At present, the AMCs charge a maximum of 2.25 per cent as the entry load for mutual fund investments.

 The market regulator has asked the AMCs to submit their views on the proposal by September 12.

 The move is seen as a way to attract more investors into mutual funds. The Reserve Bank said in its annual report for 2005-06 that just 3.6 per cent of all household savings Rs 21,139 crore was parked in mutual funds. It has risen from the level of 0.4 per cent in 2004-05 but the enthusiasm for mutual funds still remains confined to urban centres.

 The market regulator today asked the AMCs to maintain a separate account of the amount they collect as the entry load to meet selling and distribution expenses.

 The common industry practice is to use these collections to pay commissions to agents and distributors. All investors are now required to pay the entry load.

 Sebi said today that investors who did not route their investment through a distributor or an agent or a broker should be exempted from having to pay the entry load.

 Distributors add value at our point of sales. The agents and distributors earn a commission as they educate the investors and guide them into the capital market. A little less than 5 per cent of the total investors come to us directly. The distributors have a vital role to play if we wish to ensure bigger market penetration, said Jaideep Bhattacharya, chief marketing officer at UTI Mutual Fund.

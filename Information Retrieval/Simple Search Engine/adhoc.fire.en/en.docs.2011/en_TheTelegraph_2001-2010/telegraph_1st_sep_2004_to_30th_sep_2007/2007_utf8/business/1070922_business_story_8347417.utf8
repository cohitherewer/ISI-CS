 Vodafone rubbishes tax claim

 Mumbai, Sept. 21: Arun Sarin, CEO of Vodafone Group Plc and vice-chairman of Vodafone Essar, today said the joint venture had no tax liability in the country arising from its stake buyout in May.

 The income tax department had earlier sent a showcause notice to Vodafone Essar, demanding payment of capital gains tax on the deal under which it acquired a controlling interest in the countrys third largest telecom company from Hutchison Telecom International Ltd (HTIL).

 In its notice, the income tax department had asked Vodafone Essar why it should not be regarded as an agent of Vodafone and argued that it should have deducted tax at source prior to making the payment to Hong Kong-based HTIL.

 The tax department said Vodafone should have deducted capital gains tax of $2 billion from the total amount of $11.1 billion it paid HTIL.

 Emerging from a marathon five-hour meeting of Vodafone Essars board of directors, Sarin told reporters taxes were usually paid by the sellers.

 Of course, its a challenge and we are working with the income tax department to figure out what it is. But as you can understand, none of us Essar, Vodafone or Vodafone Essar is a party to this. Taxes are paid by the seller and none of these parties represent the seller, he said, in a clear indication that the joint venture would contest the income tax departments views.

 Sarins visit and the board meeting came a day after a huge rebranding exercise that saw Hutch become Vodafone. 

 Sarin, who was accompanied by Ravi Ruia, chairman of Vodafone Essar, said consumers could expect more new services from the joint venture in the days to come.

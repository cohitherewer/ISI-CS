 Pecking order of MFs no benchmark for investors 

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Mumbai, Jan. 14: Are you one of those who routinely check the top mutual fund schemes of the year, based on returns, before buying units. 

 And secure in the belief that the mind numbing returns and top slots will be effortlessly repeated by the schemes year after year, you forget to check out the pecking order of the following years. 

 But a look at the returns for the latest bull run from 2003 reveals that the top schemes of a year more often than not lose their slots and mostly settle for much lower ranks. 

 For the top 10 schemes of 2003, apart from Sundaram BNP Paribas Select Midcap, none of the schemes have been able to take up a place in the top 10 of 2006. Even Sundaram Select Midcap made a comeback in 2006 after languishing in 2004 and 2005. 

 For some, the fall has been dismal. Like Franklin India Prima Fund. This scheme was first in 2003 and 10th in 2004; it was out of the top 10 in 2005 and was 122nd last year. 

 Analysts said fund managers adopt varying investment strategies to keep up with the dynamics of the stock market, leading to changes in preferences.

 An investor should not look at the ranks of the schemes to decide on their investments, they added. 

 The market circles also admit, substantiated by the average returns of the equity diversified schemes, that last year was among the toughest for mutual funds as the schemes tried and tested many strategies to cope up with the volatile market. But none of them worked. 

 Most funds underperformed the market heavily last year, while the markets enjoyed the second best year in the four-year bull run.

 Except for Sundaram Select Midcap and Magnum Global, none of the better known schemes of earlier years could manage to feature in the top 10 list of last year. 

 Looking at the capricious market and mutual funds tendencies of slipping and sliding, it needs to be seen how many of the schemes retain their positions, how many crawl back and how many push themselves up.

 Exide draws up plans for rights issue

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 21: Leading battery maker Exide Industries will come out with a rights issue to meet a long-standing demand of shareholders. The board will meet next Tuesday to consider the offer.

 An Exide official said the company needed funds for expansion and the shareholders wanted a rights offer. However, the ratio and the ultimate utilisation of the proceeds will be decided at the board meeting, the official said.

 Exide has announced a dividend of 35 per cent 35 paise per share of Re 1 face value for the year ended March 31, 2007. It said it had obtained the permission of the board to pick up a 25 per cent stake in Ceil Motive Power Pty Ltd.

 Two individuals own this Australian battery marketing company and the acquisition cost will not be less than Aus$1 million. The cost could even go up to Aus$4 million.

 Exide expects to leverage Ceil Motives marketing network to jump to the top spot in the Australian traction battery market from the present position of number three.

 Traction batteries are used in electric forklifts, battery-operated trucks and similar vehicles. The Australian market for such batteries is five times bigger than the Indian market.

 Exide has raised its stake in Caldyne Automatics to 100 per cent from 51 per cent, with the aim of using the power solutions company as a platform for a foray into knowledge process outsourcing.

 The company has raised its projected capital expenditure to Rs 185 crore from Rs 140 crore to fund expansion plans.

 As part of this exercise, the annual production capacity of batteries for four-wheelers will be raised to seven million units from 5.6 million and that for two-wheelers to 10 million from 7 million.

 Price hike

 Sources said Exide has raised prices across different types of batteries to counter the impact of lead prices, which have shot up by 30 per cent. 

 To beat the lead-price surge, automotive and industrial battery makers are expected to raise prices between 7.5 per cent and 10 per cent.

 Soni: On success cruise

 New Delhi, Jan. 8: Tourism minister Ambika Soni today said a tax holiday for investments in budget hotels was in the offing.

 You have experience in budget hotels. Please come and share your experience, she said to the Indian diaspora on the second day of the three-day Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.

 The minister said the government was considering tax sops for investments in budget hotels. Latest data also reveal that tourist arrivals had gone up by 13 per cent in 2006.

 Promoting the sector as a major revenue earner, Soni said the government was keen to develop it through various measures, including simplifying the visa system and improving connectivity.

 Initiatives like cruise holidays, launch of helicopter services in Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, promotion of rural centres as tourism destinations and running of special tourist trains are being taken to attract foreign tourists, she said.

 In the next few weeks, there could be a decision on the tax holiday for those investing in budget hotels, Soni said. Visas should be given within 48 hours, particularly during the peak tourism season, she said.

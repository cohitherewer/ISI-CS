 Tatas clear SEZ hurdle, Reliance made to wait

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi, May 31: The government today cleared the Tata groups proposal to set up a multi-product SEZ at Gopalpur in Orissa but deferred a decision on Mukesh Ambanis Navi Mumbai project as the revenue department has raised certain objections.

 The commerce ministrys board of approval gave its nod to the Tatas Gopalpur project which will come up on more than 1,173 hectares. The clearance was delayed because the board wanted an approval from security agencies. The project is located close to a crucial missile base. In all, 23 SEZs were cleared and six given in-principle approval.

 The board, however, deferred the decision on the multi-product Navi Mumbai special economic zone as the revenue department had reservations about the fencing of five villages and water bodies that fall in the zone. 

 The department is not satisifed that the zone could be fully enclosed with only one exit and entry point, to be manned by customs officials for tracking incoming and outgoing goods. The matter is expected to come up again at the boards next meeting on June 22.

 The Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust has also raised objections on the ground that the national highway passing through the Navi Mumbai SEZ was likely to be upgraded to four lanes.

 We will seek comments from the state and promoters on the report of the revenue department, commerce secretary and board of approval chairman Gopal Pillai said.

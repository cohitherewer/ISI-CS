 Room for more Corus suitors

 - Players ready for final act in deal drama

 In the limelight

 New Delhi/London, Jan. 2 (PTI): While the fight between Tata Steel and CSN over Anglo-Dutch steel maker Corus continues, experts feel there is still time for a third suitor to put in bids ahead of the deadline set by the regulators.

 However, there is no obvious potential suitor on the horizon and whoever decides to make this move would have to act fast and launch an offer before mid-January.

 Legal experts believe the auction process could be announced a few days before the January 30 deadline set by the UK takeover panel and any revised bid from the two suitors should come by the middle of January, so that the regulators find enough time to incorporate the prevailing situation in the terms and conditions of the auction process.

 And this is the time by when a third bidder, if any, should announce its offer for Corus.

 While a spokesperson for the takeover watchdog declined to comment, saying it was hypothetical, a senior takeover panel official, who declined to be named, said any new offer would be given due consideration as and when it emerges.

 However, the emergence of a third bidder should not jeopardise the interests of shareholders that remain on top of the panels agenda, he said, adding that a bidding-war like situation has been continuing for more than three months.

 Roy-Montague Jones, partner and joint head at UK-based international law firm Richards Butler, said, It is still possible in theory for a third bidder to emerge.

 However, if there were to be a third party wishing to bid at this stage, it should aim to announce its offer not later than mid-January, which is around the same time when any revised offer should come from Tata Steel or CSN, Jones added. 

 Jones has been involved in advising various Indian and global companies on their merger and acquisition deals, while Richards Butler was adviser to one of the bidders in the takeover battle for an online auction firm QXL Ricardo Plc that itself went through an auction process in 2005.

 Any such bidder would certainly discuss the timetable for their bid with the panel on a confidential basis before announcing it. But, if a new bidder wants to secure more time to formulate its offer, it is unlikely that the panel would significantly extend the timetable now laid down, Jones said.

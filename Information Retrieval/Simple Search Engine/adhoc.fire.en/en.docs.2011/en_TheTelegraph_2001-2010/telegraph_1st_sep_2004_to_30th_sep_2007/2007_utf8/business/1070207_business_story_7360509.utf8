 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Feb. 6: The Centre will unveil a policy for the semi-conductor industry before the presentation of the Union budget, minister of state in the Prime Ministers office, Prithviraj Chavan, said today.

 We will announce the policy prior to the budget along with an incentive package... This will be over and above the benefits from special economic zones, Chavan said on the concluding day of the Vision Summit 2007 organised by the India Semiconductor Association (ISA) here.

 The proposed incentive package would cover all semiconductor-based manufacturing areas like LCD, plasma, display technology, solar and photo voltaic cells, testing, advanced micro and nano devices, the minister said.

 Stating that the manufacturing sector in India was opening up, he said the semiconductor industry was a very important driver of the economy.

 Chavan released the ISA-Ernst amp; Young benchmarking study India in the global semiconductor design ecosystem that highlighted the challenges facing the industry.

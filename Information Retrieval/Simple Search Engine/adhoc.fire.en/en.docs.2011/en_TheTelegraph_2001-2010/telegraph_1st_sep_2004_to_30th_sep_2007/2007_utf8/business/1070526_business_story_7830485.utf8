 Calcutta, May 25: Buoyant cigarette and hotel businesses have helped the city-based ITC Ltd clock a 20.8 per cent rise in profit after tax in 2006-07.

 The companys after-tax profit touched Rs 2,700 crore during the year compared with Rs 2,235.35 crore in the previous year. On a like-to-like basis, net turnover grew 26.3 per cent to Rs 12,369 crore from Rs 9,790.53 crore. 

 The non-cigarette portfolio, including hotel, paper and agri-business, grew 37.6 per cent during the year and accounted for 52.3 per cent of the companys net turnover.

 Cigarettes, however, continued to drive the companys bottomline, comprising 80.78 per cent of profit before tax and exceptional items.

 During the January-March period, profit after tax grew 14.58 per cent to Rs 650.69 crore from Rs 567.89 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal. 

 Net turnover recorded a growth of 24.5 per cent at Rs 3,466.34 crore against Rs 2,784.46 crore.

 Earnings per share for the year stood at Rs 7.19. 

 The companys board recommended a dividend of Rs 3.10 per ordinary share of Re 1 each compared with Rs 2.65 per share in the previous year. 

 New SBU

 The ITC board today decided to set up a strategic business unit for home and personal care products under the FMCG portfolio. It will herald the companys entry into body care.

 However, ITC said the move was aimed at consolidating the Essenza Di Wills range of products. The company launched prestige segment fragrance under this brand in 2005. It then extended the brand to bath and body care products last year. The Essenza Di Wills range is sold through select Wills Lifestyle Stores.

 ITCs foray into this segment comes at a time when margins in the home and personal care business are under pressure. Experts feel that ITC will exploit its cigarette sales network to market and distribute home and personal care products.

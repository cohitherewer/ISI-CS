 Mumbai, Jan 4: After General Motors and Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz now drives into Maharashtra. 

 DaimlerChrysler today announced its plans to set up a new 100-acre manufacturing facility in the Chakan MIDC area in Pune. 

 The plant will produce the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, E-Class and C-Class for the local market. While the company did not quote any investment figure, it is expected to be around Rs 250 crore. 

 Daimler India chief executive Wilfried Aulbur said: India is an important market for DaimlerChrysler and the companys relationship with the country dates back to 1954. Over the years, our relation with the country has been significant both in terms of scope and depth of offerings. 

 Indian operations have continued to impress us and they are now the benchmark for our global operations.

 The first cars from the plant will roll out in January 2009. At present, Daimler makes about 2,000 cars annually in a facility leased from Tata Motors in Maharashtra. 

 Daimler sold 2,121 units in India in 2005, nearly doubling sales from the previous year. It sells its Mercedes-Benz S-Class, E-Class and C-Class sedans in India. 

 This investment is in line with several big auto investments making its way into the state, the latest being that of Volkswagen. The German carmaker finally chose Maharashtra for setting up a $300-million (Rs 1,350-crore) greenfield automobile manufacturing facility on a 500-acre site also at Chakan, which is expected to create employment opportunities for about 2,500 people. 

 Earlier, the worlds largest automobile manufacturer, General Motors had announced its $300-million (Rs 1,350 crore) investment in the state to set up an automobile manufacturing facility in Talegaon, Maharashtra, for its small cars.

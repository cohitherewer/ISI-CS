 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 30: Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) has posted a dip in net profit for the quarter ended June 30 at Rs 191.2 crore against Rs 204.2 crore in the year-ago period. The strengthening rupee and the consequent lower export realisations affected the profit growth during the quarter.

 The profit after tax, excluding special and exceptional items, is Rs 192.2 crore against Rs 167.4 crore, an increase of 14.8 per cent, a company release said.

 The companys gross revenues and other incomes grew 16.6 per cent to Rs 2,972.8 crore from Rs 2,548.6 crore in the year-ago period.

 The sales performance of the automotive business of the company continued to be good. The companys control on material costs remains tight, the release said.

 For the period under review, the company has outperformed the industry in its core utility vehicles business with a growth of 23.6 per cent against an industry growth of 8.2 per cent.

 The company sold 31,171 utility vehicles in the first quarter against 25,216 in the same period of the previous year. The groups consolidated gross revenues and other income during the quarter grew 40.7 per cent at Rs 5,879.2 crore against Rs 4,179.5 crore in the year-ago period.

 Tractorul bid

 M amp;Ms attempt to acquire Romanias state-owned Tractorul, a tractor company, may hit a roadblock. The new government in Romania has sold tractoral to a private firm and now the liquidator is talking to us, an M amp;M official said.

 The new Romanian government was interested in selling the real estate of Tractorul and not the tractor company, he said.

 Capacity expansion

 M amp;M will spend Rs 6,400 crore over the next three years on capacity expansion, product development and research and development.

 The company needs to incur considerable expenditure to expand capacities, invest in research and development and develop products in the next few years, M amp;M chairman Keshub Mahindra said.

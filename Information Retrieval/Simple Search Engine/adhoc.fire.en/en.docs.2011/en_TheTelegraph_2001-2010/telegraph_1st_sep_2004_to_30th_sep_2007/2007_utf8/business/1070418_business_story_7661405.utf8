 Reliance bets big on Bengal gas grid

 A STAFF REPORTER

 NEW AVENUES

 Calcutta, April 17: Reliance plans to invest Rs 4,000-5,000 crore in its proposed gas grid project in Bengal.

 The Mukesh Ambani-controlled company will lay a pipeline from the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin in Andhra Pradesh to the state in the next three years.

 The 1,100-km pipeline will require an investment of around Rs 8,000 crore. Moreover, the company will set up gas distribution networks in the major districts of the state. It envisages an investment of Rs 1,000 crore per district.

 A Reliance official, who met Bengal commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen, today said the company would set up networks in Hooghly, Howrah, Midnapur and North 24-Parganas districts, besides Calcutta.

 We have made a commitment to the Bengal government to bring gas and we will abide by that, R.P. Sharma, president of the LNG business of Reliance Industries, said here today.

 The capacity of the pipeline from the KG basin will be 10 million standard cubic meter per day (mmscmd). So far, 3.5 mmscmd of replacement demand demand from industry switching from existing fuel to gas has been identified. The state government will give Reliance an estimate of the demands from other industries. 

 The company plans to supply natural gas to households, industry and the automobile sector. The pipeline from the KG basin will also carry gas from the Reliance gasfield in offshore Orissa.

 Gas will start flowing from the KG basin from 2008. 

 The Orissa oil block, which will start production from 2010-11, has potential reserves of up to 20 trillion cubic ft.

 The eastern region, especially Bengal, was starved of gas. With the Reliance pipeline, the scenario will change. Gas may have the same positive impact on Bengal as it had on Gujarat where many gas-based industries came up, an expert said.

 The company will require the right of way to create the pipeline. For this, it will require the state governments assistance.

 US Airways raises Delta bid

 Lofty aim

 New York, Jan. 10 (Reuters): US Airways Group Inc said on Wednesday it has raised its takeover offer for bankrupt rival Delta Air Lines Inc to $10.2 billion in cash and stock.

 The new bid offers $5 billion in cash and $89.5-million US Airways shares. The original offer, made in November and rejected by Delta last month, was for $4 billion in cash and $78.5-million US Airways shares.

 US Airways said the offer would expire on February 1, unless it gets support from Delta creditors to perform due diligence and postpone a February 7 hearing that would start the voting on Deltas stand-alone plan.

 While our original proposal offered substantially more value to Deltas unsecured creditors than the Delta stand-alone plan, we are making this revised offer to eliminate any doubt, said US Airways chief executive Doug Parker in a statement. It is time for this process to move forward.

 US Airways expects the acquisition of the larger Atlanta-based carrier to be accretive to earnings per share in the first full year after completion.

 Delta and its official committee of unsecured creditors werent immediately available for comment.

 The raised offer came after US Airways on Monday bolstered the financial muscle behind its bid by adding Morgan Stanley as a financial backer alongside Citigroup.

 Focus on creditors

 US Airways Group is focusing on Deltas creditors and has no meetings planned with the bankrupt airlines management, the US Airways CEO said.

 Given the Delta managements reaction so far, where the negotiations really turned is to the creditors, Parker told Reuters in a phone interview.

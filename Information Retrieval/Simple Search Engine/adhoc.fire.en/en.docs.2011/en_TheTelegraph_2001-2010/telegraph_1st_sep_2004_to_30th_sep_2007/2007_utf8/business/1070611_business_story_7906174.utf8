 Q amp;A

 Tax benefits

 My date of birth is 10.05.1943. When will I be eligible for the tax benefits of a senior citizen? If my total annual income is below the basic exemption limit, from which year can I stop filing my income tax returns?

 B.N. Poddar, Calcutta

 You will be 65 on May 10 next year. This corresponds to the financial year 2008-09. You will qualify as a senior citizen and be able to avail of the tax benefits from the assessment year 2009-10. If your annual income in the financial year 2008-09 is less than the basic exemption limit for senior citizens at that time, you would not be required to file income tax returns in the 2009-10 assessment year.

 Share purchase

 I am 30 years old and unemployed. My father gifted me Rs 20,000. I intend to invest the sum in stocks. I have a PAN and want to open a demat account. If I purchase some shares and sell the same in two to three months and make some profits, do I need to pay income tax even if the total yearly income is below the basic exemption limit for women? Do I need to file income tax returns?

 Lekha Boliar, Baruipara

 Any capital gain arising out of the sale of shares 

 held for less than 12 months is subject to tax. However, 

 if your total annual income, including the short-term 

 capital gains, is less than the basic exemption limit, 

 you dont have to pay any income tax. But you will 

 have to file income tax returns. 

 Health insurance

 I have taken a health policy of Rs 2 lakh. I made a claim of Rs 25,000 through submission of medical bills. Can I make further claims later on, if necessary? What would be the maximum amount of insurance at that time?

 V.P. Rao, Calcutta

 You can make claims towards medical expenses provided the policy is renewed every year. The maximum amount that you can claim would be the sum assured in the policy, that is Rs 2 lakh. But you wont be able to get any no-claim benefits that insurers often offer as addition to sum assured or reduction in premium cost.

 If you have any queries about investing or 

 taxes or a high-cost purchase you are planning, mail

 Fillip for fertiliser on way

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: The government is planning to issue Rs 12,000-crore bonds and offer Rs 5,000-crore additional subsidy to fertiliser companies.

 The group of ministers on fertiliser subsidies, to meet later this week, is expected to agree to the proposal.

 Higher urea and gas prices have pushed up subsidy projections for the year to Rs 47,000 crore, way above the Rs 22,450-crore allocation in the budget.

 This has prompted the move for additional support, which at Rs 17,000 crore still leaves uncovered a part of the dues.

 Finance ministry officials said, We have taken a decision at inter-ministry meetings to pay an additional tranche of Rs 17,000 crore which we would like to split in the ratio of 70 per cent bonds and 30 per cent cash subsidies.

 The bonds will be interest-bearing IOU slips, similar to the ones for oil companies. 

 Companies can include the bonds in their balancesheets and/or sell them at a discount.

 However, fertiliser companies, which are mostly in the private sector, may want more of direct subsidies and less of bonds.

 A round of negotiations may come about before a final decision on the quantum of bonds is arrived at but as of now we want to split the subsidy in the ratio of 70:30, the officials said. 

 The ministers will also deliberate on replacing the policy of subsidies to urea makers with reliefs on soil nutrient mixes.

 A farm panel, set up by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, has said large tracts of land have become barren because of excessive use of urea. 

 They have blamed the current policy of heavy urea subsidy, which makes it cheaper than other fertilisers, for the problem.

 An option is to let the farmer choose the mix of nutrients that best suits the requirements. This will determine the price and subsidy given to either the farmer or the company.

 Subsidy for this programme is Rs 26,000 crore, lower than both last fiscals payout of Rs 34,000 crore and the projection of Rs 47,000 crore for this year.

 The officials said farmers would pay more for fertilisers, but higher efficiency of use would compensate for the reduced subsidy.

 Now cash at your doorstep

 Just a call away

 Mumbai, May 24: The Reserve Bank of India today allowed banks to deliver cash at an individuals doorstep. The cash can be delivered either against cheques received at bank counters or requests received through phone or Internet banking.

 In February, the RBI had come out with broad guidelines that enabled banks to pick up cash and other instruments from residential or office premises of all customers, including individuals. However, the guidelines did not include delivery of cash at an individuals doorstep.

 quot;It has been decided to permit banks to deliver cash and draft at the doorstep of individual customer either against cheques received at the counter or requests received through any secure convenient channel such as phone/Internet banking, quot; the central bank said in a notification issued today.

 The RBI has allowed bankers to fix their own cash limit for doorstep banking and clarified that a customer cannot claim any right to the service. Banks can deliver cash/draft either through their own employees or agents.

 Banks have been given the freedom to fix their own service charge for offering doorstep banking.

 According to the guidelines, banks are required to issue acknowledgement receipt on their behalf and credit the cash collected from the customer on the same day or the next working day depending upon the time of collection. 

 The guidelines, however, do not permit banks to issue demand drafts against the cash received from the consumers doorstep. Banks have been allowed to issue drafts on the basis of requisition in writing or on receipt of cheque.

 Yatra.com ties up with Reliance Web World

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 27: Online travel portal Yatra.com is set to become a $120-million company by December.

 The company has tied up with Reliance Capital to offer online travel solutions through the Reliance Web World outlets. The travel desks in these outlets will handle the operations. 

 The company has three investors Norwest Venture Partners, Reliance Capital and TV18. Together they have pumped in $10 million in Yatra.com. Reliance Capital and TV18 are the strategic investors. The company has been earning revenues in excess of $5 million a month.

 Since our launch in August last year, we have maintained a slightly higher growth rate than the industry rate of 100 per cent. Hence, the ambitious target. We have also introduced international bookings to provide attractive international air fares and destination choices to our customers, said Nikhil Rungta, head of marketing, Yatra.com.

 The project with Reliance Web World has been initially launched in Mumbai, Bangalore and Calcutta.

 Besides Yatra.com, four other big players in the online travel market include makemytrip.com, cleartrip.com, indiatimestravel.com and travelguru.com.

 The advent of low-cost carriers (LCC) has been a boon to popularise online travel bookings. The LCCs prefer e-tickets to save on basic costs. Hence the rapid growth in online bookings, Rungta added.

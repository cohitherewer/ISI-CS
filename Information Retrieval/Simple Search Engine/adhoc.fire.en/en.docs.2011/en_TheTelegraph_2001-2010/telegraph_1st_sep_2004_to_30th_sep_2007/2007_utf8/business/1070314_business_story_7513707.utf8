 Vodafone, Essar to ink deal soon

 London, March 13 (PTI): Bridging the differences on management structure and ownership issues, Vodafone and Essar would most likely ink a deal in the next two-three days for jointly running Indias fourth-largest mobile firm Hutch Essar Ltd (HEL).

 Arun Sarin, CEO of Vodafone, would visit New Delhi for the purpose.

 As part of the deal, Essars Ravi Ruia would be the chairman of the reconstituted board of HEL, while Sarin is expected to be the vice-chairman, sources said.

 Officials of Vodafone remained tight-lipped about the development, while the spokesperson of the Indian partner maintained that the talks were on and that we would not like to comment at this juncture.

 Meanwhile, Vodafones deal is likely to be considered by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board tomorrow. Issues have been raised on whether the deal would be compliant with the existing FDI norms in telecom.

 Even as two minority shareholders Asim Ghosh and Analjit Singh have declared that they are the 100 per cent owner of their holdings in the firm and all benefits would accrue to them, the government has asked various agencies, including the RBI and FIPB, to see that there was no breach of FDI norms.

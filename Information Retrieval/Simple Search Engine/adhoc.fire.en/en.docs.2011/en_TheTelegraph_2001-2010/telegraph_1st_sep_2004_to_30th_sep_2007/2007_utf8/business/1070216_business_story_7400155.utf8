 Essar to stay put in Hutch

 Mumbai, Feb. 15: The Ruias of the Essar group have no plans to sell their stake and exit from Hutchison Essar, the countrys fourth largest cellular company.

 While that may be good news for Vodafone CEO Arun Sarin, there are indications that some prickly issues could arise with the Ruias asserting that they will not brook any dilution of their existing rights, including the right of first refusal (RoFR), in case of a stake sale.

 Sarin met the Ruias at their Walkeshwar residence in South Mumbai. Sarins meeting, which lasted for over two-and-a-half hours, was largely been seen as an effort by the India-born CEO to ensure a smooth transition process at Hutchison Essar.

 Sarin was accompanied by senior Vodafone executives, while the Essar group was led by its chairman Shashi Ruia and vice-chairman Ravi Ruia. Second-generation Ruias, Prashant and Anshuman, were also understood to have participated in the meeting.

 The meeting was held amid reports that the Ruias, who own 33 per cent in Hutchison Essar, were upset over the fact that they had not been informed before Vodafone entered into an agreement with Bharti Airtel over sharing of telecom infrastructure.

 After the meeting, Ravi Ruia told reporters, We are clear that Essar is a long-term player in the telecom industry and we have no plans to exit this company or business. He added that the group intended to run the business together with Vodafone.

 The Vodafone CEO said, I have got to know the family well. I am delighted that they are in the company today. I look forward to a wonderful partnership.

 Although Sarin and the Ruias refused to spell out the issues that they wanted to iron out, it is clear that the Ruias are keen on protecting all their rights. This became evident late in the evening when the Essar group issued an official statement.

 Essar is a founding shareholder of Hutchison Essar and the group sees telecom as a core part of its business portfolio for the long term, an official statement said.

 The Ruias said they would take a decision on their future course of action in due course and in the best interests of the Essar group. But they asserted, We will ensure that all of our shareholder rights, including those under our shareholders agreement with Hutchison, are adhered to.

 Sources close to the conglomerate said they were referring to the groups RoFR.

 Paswan spanner in gas price

 Paswan: Keeping in check

 New Delhi, Sept. 4: The price proposed by Reliance Industries for the gas from Krishna Godavari (KG) basin is biased against consumers, fertiliser minister Ram Vilas Paswan has stated in a letter to Pranab Mukherjee, who is heading the group of ministers on the issue.

 Paswans missive appears to rule out the possibility of an early end to the dispute, which has lined up Reliance against PSU power and fertiliser companies who get cheap gas.

 The letter, sent to Mukherjee last week, states, The contractor undertook a limited bidding which was not transparent as pointed out by the committee of secretaries... moreover the formula was devised by the contractor himself, the basis of which is not very clear.

 Reliance wants $4.33 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) at land fall for the gas, implying a price of $4.8-5.4 per mBtu at factories for consumers.

 Power utilities and fertiliser firms are opposed to the price as it is much higher than the fixed price of $2.5 per mBtu they pay to the government.

 The group of ministers has been assigned the task of working out a compromise formula to resolve the row. Several rounds of meetings have yielded no results. 

 Paswan, in his letter, argued that bidders were asked to quote on the basis of a very small component of the overall formula and that the bidding was restricted to 10 selected bidders. Hence, the price achieved was not at arms length as required.

 Earlier, the fertiliser ministry had said that if the government agreed to the price of $4.5 per mBtu, the already bloated subsidy bill would go up by Rs 3,600 crore.

 Fertiliser prices are kept low by the government to appease the farm lobby, and with farmer suicides a nation-wide political issue, there is little chance of passing on the higher price of gas to farmers.

 The CPM has also urged the government against setting an unfair price for the (Reliance) gas. 

 The present price formulation made by RIL in 2007 is in no way consistent with the price of $2.34 quoted by the same RIL in 2004 for supplying gas from the same KG Basin to NTPC through an international competitive bidding, a note by the CPM politburo said. 

 According to the note, even if the price quoted in 2004 through competitive bidding is indexed to the present time, it can in no way allow an 85 per cent hike as has been done by RIL while fixing the price at $4.33 mBtu.

 However, official sources said that gas prices will have to be raised as current rates were too low.

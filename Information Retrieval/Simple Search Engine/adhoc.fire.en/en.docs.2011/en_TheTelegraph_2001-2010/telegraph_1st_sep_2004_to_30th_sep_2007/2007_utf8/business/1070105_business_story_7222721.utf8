 Fillip for co-op banks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Reddy: Strong move

 Mumbai, Jan. 4: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is planning to allow strong urban co-operative banks (UCBs) to open branches and enter new businesses such as insurance and mutual funds, to put them on a strong footing.

 As many as nine state governments have signed MoUs with the RBI in this regard.

 The MoUs envisage RBI support to the banks on technology, while states will help them in governance. The RBI considers 677 of the 1,853 urban co-operative banks as weak.

 RBI governor Y.V. Reddy said 30 per cent of the urban co-operative banks in Maharashtra, making up 25 per cent of the deposits, were weak. He said the remaining 75 per cent of deposits, aggregating Rs 70,000 crore, were safe. 

 Reddy was speaking to newspersons after the first meeting of the task force for urban cooperative banks for Maharashtra, which was put in place after the state signed the MoU with the Reserve Bank on December 13.

 Reddy said the central bank, state government and the UCBs would sort out various issues relating to the MoUs. 

 Everybody is starting the process with a goodwill... Over a period there would be a cumulative positive effect of minimising the problem, he added.

 Reddy said the purpose of the MoUs was to cleanse the UCBs, making them capable of opening new branches and enter new businesses.

 However, the approval for branches would be given only in the next fiscal, Reddy said.

 The RBI governor also kept the door open for infusion of funds through bonds or Tier II capital.

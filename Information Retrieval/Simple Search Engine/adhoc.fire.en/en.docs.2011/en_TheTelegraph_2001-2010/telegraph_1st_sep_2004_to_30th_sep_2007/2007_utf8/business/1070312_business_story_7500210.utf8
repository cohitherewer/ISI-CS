New Delhi, March 11: Continuing with the spectacular double-digit growth, passenger car sales in the country grew 46.67 per cent in February, even as motorcycles saw a meagre rise of 4.93 per cent. The scooter segment registered a growth of 11.67 per cent.

 Domestic passenger car sales stood at 92,594 units against 63,213 units in the same month a year ago, while motorcycle sales stood at 5,16,410 units against 4,92,116 units in the corresponding period last year, according to figures released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). 

 Industry sources, however, pointed out the large overall growth in the passenger cars segment was due to the fact that in the corresponding month last year sales were minimal as customers postponed purchases expecting an excise duty cut on small cars.

 Maruti Udyog Ltd (MUL) lead the pack clocking sales of 50,666 units last month against 32,259 units in the corresponding period last year, up 57 per cent, said Siam. 

 Tata Motors was the second-runner selling 16,016 units against 14,200 units last year, up 12.78 per cent. Korean rival Hyundai Motor India registered sales of 15,432 units in February against 8,780 units in the same month last year. This is a growth of 75.76 per cent. 

 The motorcycle segment put up a poor show as Bajaj Auto sales dropped to 1,46,642 units against 1,57,386 units in the same month last year, down 6.82 per cent. Market leader Hero Honda clocked sales of 2,67,856 units during the month against 2,41,232 units last year, up 11 per cent.

 On the two-wheeler front, the scooter segment sold 82,944 units in February against 74,271 units in the same month a year ago. 

 The figures revealed that Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India registered sales of 49,952 units against 45,935 units in the same month last year, while Hero Honda sold 7,491 units against 3,000 units. 

 Total two-wheeler sales during the month stood at 6,31,514 units against 5,95,713 units last year, up 6 per cent. Sale of commercial vehicles grew by 26.45 per cent at 44,322 units against 35,049 units in the corresponding month last year, said Siam.

 Tata Motors continued its growth momentum in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle (M amp;HCV) goods carrier segment clocking 15,035 units compared to 12,085 units in the same month last year, up 19.62 units. Ashok Leyland registered sales of 6,041 units against 4,424 units. 

 Cumulative growth of passenger vehicles segment during April-February 2007 compared to the corresponding period in the last year was 22.91 per cent, while that of passenger cars in the same duration was 24.76 per cent. 

 However, for the period April-February 2007, commercial vehicles segment grew by 36.12 per cent while three wheeler sales grew by 14.5 per cent.

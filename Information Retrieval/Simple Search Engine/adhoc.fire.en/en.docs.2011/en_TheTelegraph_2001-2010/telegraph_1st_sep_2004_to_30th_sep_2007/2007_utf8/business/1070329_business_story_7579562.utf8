 Satyam bags $200m deal from US firm

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Raju: Good show

 Calcutta, March 28: Satyam Computer Service has bagged a $200-million contract from US-based semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials Inc, which will be executed over the next five years.

 Satyam will develop software and maintain the information technology infrastructure of Applied Materials.

 Satyams TIMES telecom-infrastructure-media amp; entertainment-semiconductor vertical would execute this contract. The support would be provided on a turnkey basis, said T.R. Anand, director and senior vice-president of Satyam.

 Satyam has provided application development, maintenance, support and engineering services to Applied Materials for five years prior to this announcement. The contract would be realised at $40 million for each year.

 Anand declined to comment on the value of the services provided to Applied Materials during the last five years. He, however, said it was lower than $40 million per annum.

 The TIMES vertical contributes 20 per cent to Satyams turnover and is among the fastest growing verticals in the company.

 We believe the managed services model, along with service-level agreements, is the right approach for applied materials, said Ron Kifer, group vice-president and chief information officer of Applied Materials.

 We expect this model to provide us with a very cost-effective solution to manage IT and business infrastructure processes and activities, as well as measurable service level and quality enhancements, he added.

 The contract will be executed through a managed services model. This model is one of selective outsourcing, where a preferred partner manages certain applications and services driven by the customers desire to mitigate risk and realise increased reward, said Anand.

 Satyams founder and chairman B. Ramalinga Raju said the company expects the managed services approach to become commonplace, and to serve as a model for numerous future engagements with other customers.

 This is different from outsourcing call centre services and back-office work like accounting and billing. 

 Satyam is also setting up a dedicated development centre for Applied Materials in its electronics city campus in Bangalore.

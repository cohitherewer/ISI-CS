 SpiceJet weighs hub in city

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: Low-cost carrier SpiceJet plans to use the city as a hub for flights to Southeast Asia and China.

 It also plans to use Kochi as a hub for Gulf flights. We aim to fly those people who have never been abroad before, said Ajay Singh, director of SpiceJet.

 We want the experience criteria for domestic airlines to be relaxed preferably to three years, which means we can start flying abroad from next year, said Singh

 The Kansagra family-owned airline expects an exponential rise in traffic to Southeast Asia and China from the city.

 Another airline which can join the race to fly abroad if the experience criteria is reduced to three years is Vijay Mallyas Kingfisher. The airline aims to fly to Europe, the US and the east Asian countries. 

 Singh said SpiceJet was among the few low-cost carriers that have the capability to fly abroad. 

 This will be a volumes game, where quick turnarounds and low costs at airports and other departments will mean we will be able to make international travel much more affordable, said Singh. 

 SpiceJets plan is to cover cities within a flying radius of 4-5 hours, using its fleet of Boeing 737 800s. The airline, which has 15 Boeing aircraft, plans to add another 10 planes. This will fulfill the the fleet-size criterion for flying abroad. By the end of 2009, SpiceJet is eyeing a fleet of 35 aircraft. 

 We have ordered three Boeing 737-900 extended range planes for slightly long-distance routes such as south China, said Singh. 

 SpiceJets main hub is in Delhi. However, Calcutta is a cheaper and spacious option. It has a good east-west connectivity and may become a bigger hub than Delhi.

 At hubs, airline companies have their hangars, maintenance and overhaul facilities. Airline hubs bring in large investments from carriers and service providers.

 It makes sense to make Calcutta our hub. Routes out of it are lucrative, yet the skies out of the city are not yet crowded, Singh said. Most airlines have hubs at Delhi or Mumbai airports. One airline operates from Bangalore and another from Chennai.

 The move to turn Calcutta into a hub for foreign flights will boost the airlines connectivity with other regions. 

 It already connects or plans to connect Bhubaneshwar, Bangalore, Delhi, Guwahati, Bagdogra, Mumbai, Nagpur and Raipur with the eastern city. The Kansagras, who own a majority stake in SpiceJet, have business interests in East Africa and the UK but are yet to explore options in east Asia. 

 However, Macritchie Investments, a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapores Temasek Holdings, and Dubai-based Istithmar have stakes in SpiceJet.

 Trading woes for jute firms

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Calcutta, Aug. 13: The jute industry wants the government to protect it from dabba trade in the commodity.

 In industry parlance, dabba trade is the futures transaction in raw jute made through computers without ensuring the physical delivery of the commodity. 

 Futures trade in raw jute started on the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) from August 1. Such a practice has given rise to speculation and price increase.

 Prices have shot up over the past 10 days and a hoarding tendency has developed among jute traders, creating a shortage of the commodity, said an industry spokesperson.

 The price of raw jute grade TD-4, which was quoted at Rs 1,170 per quintal on the MCX platform on August 1 for delivery on August 30, was quoted around Rs 1,380 today for the same delivery period. Spot prices have also followed the same pattern and closed today at Rs 1,250 against Rs 1,143 on August 1.

 Arindam Saha, regional manager of MCX, said there was nothing unusual about the futures trade on the MCX platform. Supply of raw jute from districts has drastically fallen over the past two weeks because of widespread rains in the east. Trade was being carried on smoothly and recorded a daily turnover of Rs 8 to 10 crore, Saha said.

 A spokesman for the East India Jute and Hessian Exchange Ltd, the city-based body which conducts futures trade in jute, said excessive speculation would harm the industry. Speculation was at its peak when August 30 delivery price of Rs 1,380 is compared with todays spot price of Rs 1,250. One gets a cut of 10 to 11 per cent in just 17 days, the spokesman said.

 Indian Jute Mills Association chairman Sanjay Kajaria said the industry might have to close down if the government does not intervene. The association will hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday and seek the support of the state and the Centre to stop futures trade in raw jute.

 Patel: Big plans

 New Delhi, May 10: National Aviation Company of India Limited, the entity that emerged from the merger of Air-India and Indian, will use the Air-India brand overseas. The company also plans to have a hub in Europe.

 Civil aviation minister Praful Patel today said the financial and legal aspects of the merger would be completed by July 15. 

 The national carriers have already started the process of amalgamation and rescheduling of flights, the minister said. The rescheduling of the flights is expected to generate substantial savings. Consultancy firm Accenture is working on the estimates.

 Patel said Air-India would have a hub in Europe. Rival Jet is planning to have one in Brussels. 

 This will make the company a vital player in the India-US sector. The hub will enable it to tie up with an European operator for connecting flights in the continent.

 The minister said the first new wide-bodied aircraft, ordered by Air-India from Boeing, would arrive by June and it would have the new livery and logo of the merged entity. quot;The design of the new livery has been sent to the manufacturer, quot; he said.

 New policy

 The new aviation policy, to be placed before the Cabinet soon, will review the norms for overseas operations. Under the existing rules, only carriers that are operating for five years can fly abroad.

 Patel said an overall review of the policy would be taken up keeping in mind the ability of the carriers to handle these routes and take on international competition.

 It will not be a blanket opening up of all international sectors for the private carriers, but will depend on the needs of the country, the routes that exist and capability of the Indian carriers to handle specific routes, he said.

 Patel said the issue of opening up of the Gulf routes would also be considered. Only Indian and Air-India are allowed to operate in this sector. 

 There are several European carriers flying into India. However, only the merged Air India-Indian and Jet-Air Sahara have flights to Europe. These issues will be considered in the review.

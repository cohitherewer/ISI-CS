 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 24: JSW Steel, part of . P. Jindals JSW Group, will be investing about Rs 17,000 crore to raise its steel-making capacity to about 10 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2010 from the current level at 3.8 mtpa. 

 We are concentrating on organic growth within India. Our expansion projects are in progress and the 6.8 mtpa plant at Vijaynagar will be completed before schedule. We are still awaiting the approval from the Centre for mining in Jharkhand. A couple of more expansion plans in the eastern region are still in the pipeline, Sajjan Jindal, vice-chairman and managing director of JSW Steel Ltd,. said. 

 The company is also in the process of building its own captive coal mining capacity, which will be operational from April next year. The company said it had invested about Rs 10, 500 crore towards expansion plans till March. 

 The investment of Rs 17,000 crore will come out of a mix of debt and internal accruals. Debt will comprise Rs 10,000 crore. 

 Earlier reports suggested that the company wanted to raise its capacity to 30 mtpa by 2020. In line with this, the company is setting up greenfield projects of 10 million tonnes each in West Bengal and Jharkhand by 2020. The company had said these two units would come up with an addition of 3 million tonnes every three years. 

 JSW Steel said that after 2010 it would have an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, which would generate enough cash to fund further expansion. The company is expecting to get the mining lease in the next four to six months. It was also announced that the company would invest about Rs 800 crore to increase its iron-ore production capacity to about 20 million tonnes from the current level of 3 million tonnes. 

 The company said it was looking for a suitable company in Karnataka to buy about 17 million tonnes of low grade iron-ore, which would be further upgraded within the companys own manufacturing capacity.

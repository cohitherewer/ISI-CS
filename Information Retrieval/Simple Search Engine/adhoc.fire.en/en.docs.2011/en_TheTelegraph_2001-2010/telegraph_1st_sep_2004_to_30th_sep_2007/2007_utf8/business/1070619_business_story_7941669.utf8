 Jalan: Looking ahead

 Calcutta , June 18: The Paris Chamber of Commerce will set up its operations in India soon. The first office will come up in Mumbai. 

 Chambre de Commerce et dindustrie de Paris, or CCIP, will help French companies increase their presence in India and educate their personnel on their future needs. It will also assist companies in organising conventions and trade fairs. 

 Mahendra Kumar Jalan, the honorary consul of France in Calcutta and owner of Keventer Agro, welcomed the move. He expects it to cement trade ties between the two nations. 

 Honour for Jalan

 Jalan has been conferred the Officer of the National Order of Merit by a decree issued by former French President Jacques Chirac. Dominique Girard, the Ambassador of France to India, will be in the city on Wednesday to give the award. 

 In a letter, Girard said the award was being given for Jalans decisive role as the honorary consul of France in Calcutta to develop better relations between the two countries in trade and culture. 

 During his tenure, the interest of French companies in Bengal, especially in the food processing sector, has increased.

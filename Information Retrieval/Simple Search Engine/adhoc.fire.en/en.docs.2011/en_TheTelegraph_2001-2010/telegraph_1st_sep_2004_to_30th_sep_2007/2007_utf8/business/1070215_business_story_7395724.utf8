 Mumbai, Feb. 14: The alliance between Tata Motors and Fiat Auto will now have global footprints. The companies have jointly started an industrial project that will make pick-up trucks in Argentina at an investment of $80 million. 

 While the trucks will carry the Fiat brand name, they will be designed on the new generation Tata pick-up truck and manufactured at Fiats Cordoba unit in Argentina. 

 The trucks will roll out of the Cordoba plant in 2008. Annual production is expected to be around 20,000 units. The trucks will be sold in south and central America and select European markets through Fiat Automobiles distribution and importer network. This will help the Fiat brand enter the medium pick-up segment piggybacking on Tata Motors know-how. 

 Announcing the agreement, Tata Motors said it is a significant step towards an integrated strategy of targeting specific markets and segments. It follows a feasibility study that started in July last year. 

 The Fiat complex in Cordoba now manufactures Fiat engines and gearboxes as also gearboxes for PSA Peugeot-Citren. It will now run to full capacity, an analyst said. 

 The styling and positioning of the Fiat pick-up will be different from the Tata vehicle. It will be available in various versions. Tata Motors said it considers Latin America as an important market and is examining the option of offering its products in this region.

 This agreement is a further step in the building of a large, focused partnership with Tata, Sergio Marchionne, CEO of the Fiat Group and of Fiat Group Automobiles, said. 

 Tata Motors chairman Ratan Tata said, I am very pleased at this first step in expanding our relationship with the Fiat group beyond India.

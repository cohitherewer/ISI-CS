 Cement firms in no mood to oblige FM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chidambaram: Patient

 New Delhi, March 22: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today failed to bring cement manufacturers around to reducing prices but has kept the door open for further negotiations.

 Cement manufacturers have told the government nothing can be done on reducing prices, a senior official said. Chidambaram told the companies that they were making high profits and, therefore, could afford to lower prices to bring down inflation. 

 However, the cement manufacturers are reported to have told the government that they have started doing well only since the latter part of 2005 whereas in the previous 15 years they were struggling.

 Sources said the companies did not moot any price reduction formula during their meeting with the finance minister, who wanted prices to go back to the pre-budget levels.

 After the meeting, the minister claimed a section of the industry was keen to cooperate with the government for checking the price rise.

 I get the impression there are both views in the industry. One is a more sober view; that we must help the government control inflation. The other view seems to be more hawkish, he said.

 It is my hope they will discuss among themselves and come back with some proposals to the government. I have asked the industry secretary to keep in touch with them, if they have any proposals, he said. The finance minister had called the cement manufacturers for the second time after the budget, which imposed dual excise duty structure on cement to rein in prices.

 We have information on how much your sales have increased. How much your profit before tax has increased. How much your profit after tax has increased. So you should come forward with some proposals on moderating cement prices, Chidambaram said he had told the delegation of cement companies. 

 The government is worried over rising prices as it has become a political hot potato with both the Opposition parties and its Left allies repeatedly raising the issue.

 Demand for cement is growing at an annual 10 percent as the country is expanding its infrastructure to sustain high economic growth.

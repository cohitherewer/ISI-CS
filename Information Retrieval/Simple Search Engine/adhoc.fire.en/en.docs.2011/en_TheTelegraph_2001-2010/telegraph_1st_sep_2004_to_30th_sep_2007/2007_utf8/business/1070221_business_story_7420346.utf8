 Priority to farm credit

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: The Congress-led government is planning to allow Nabard float tax-free bonds to recapitalise rural co-operative banks and an increase in loan subsidy for farmers to 3 per cent from 2 per cent earlier. 

 High incidence of rural indebtedness and crop failures have led to farmers committing suicides, prompting the government to offer cheap farm credit and beef up infrastructure in villages.

 In addition to the credit package, allocations to farm ministries agriculture, water resources and food processing are expected to go up by 10-15 per cent.

 With deposit costs and lending rates for banks rising, North Block is considering an increase in farm subsidy to 3 per cent from 2 per cent.

 The government has given around Rs 1,900 crore as interest subsidy to farmers who get loans at rates 7 per cent that are on a par with blue chip companies. With the recent round of rate hikes, loans to farmers are cheaper than that for corporate houses.

 In the budget, the interest subsidy is likely to be at Rs 2,500-3,000 crore, allowing banks to offer farmers loans at a higher subsidy.

 North Block feels tax-free bonds by Nabard will recapitalise rural cooperative banks. The sector needs around Rs 15,000 crore, and though the Centre through Nabard as well as the state government have brought funds, it is still not enough.

 Nabard has a Bhavishya Nirman bond with a pre-tax yearly return of 7.5 per cent and post-tax return of 6.9 per cent. However, for more funds, Nabard needs to offer bonds at more attractive terms. Officials said this may be allowed.

 The government is worried over the growth rate in farm sector, which dipped to 2.7 per cent this fiscal after touching 6 per cent in the previous fiscal.

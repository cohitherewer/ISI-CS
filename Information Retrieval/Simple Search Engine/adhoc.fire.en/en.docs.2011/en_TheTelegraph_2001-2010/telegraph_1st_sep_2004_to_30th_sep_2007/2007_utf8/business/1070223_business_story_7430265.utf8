 Central sales tax cut to 3%

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Feb. 22: The government has initiated the process of phasing out of central sales tax (CST), imposed on inter-state sale of goods, by cutting it from 4 per cent to 3 per cent in the next fiscal.

 The move will pave the way for a nation-wide value-added tax (VAT) regime and smooth rollout of goods and services tax (GST), while giving a boost to the process of developing a national common market. 

 CST, at 4 per cent now, will be cut by one percentage point every year over the next four years, resulting in its abolition from 2010-11. 

 The Centre will table a bill, Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2007 in the coming Parliament session to initiate the process of CST cut, said P.R. Das Munshi, information and broadcasting minister.

 The Centre will also amend the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, and Additional Duties of Excise (goods of special importance) Act, 1957, Das Munshi added.

 The states will be compensated for revenue loss from the cut in CST. Besides a budgetary support, the share of states on the tax on 33 services will be raised to 100 per cent from 30.5 per cent, while the states can tax another 44 services.

 A consensus is there for the 33 services, but in the case of the other 44, there are differences as this involves taxing services such as education which the states are loath to do for fear of a public outcry.

 Meanwhile, a delegation of the empowered group of state finance ministers on VAT met finance minister P. Chidambaram before the cabinet briefing. Details of the meet were, however, kept under wraps by the chairman of the empowered group, Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta.

 CST is estimated to generate more than Rs 25,000 crore in revenues in the next fiscal, and if the tax is reduced by 1 per cent, states are likely to lose about Rs 6,250 crore.

 Micro-finance rules

 The cabinet also approved a legislation on micro-finance that will speed up the flow of credit to the poor.

 The legislation gives a legal framework for the micro-finance sector. It will promote an environment to develop micro finance services more effectively.

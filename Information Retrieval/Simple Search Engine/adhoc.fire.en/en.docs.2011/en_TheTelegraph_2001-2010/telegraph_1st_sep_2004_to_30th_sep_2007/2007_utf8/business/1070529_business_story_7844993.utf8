 New Delhi, May 28: States that prevent power thefts and cut transmission and distribution losses will be rewarded, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said today. The government will convert loans into grants if state-run electricity boards achieve benchmarks in controlling T amp;D losses. 

 Addressing chief ministers at a conference on the power sector, Singh said: T amp;D losses, almost 30-45 per cent in many states, threaten the financial health of this sector. A large proportion of these losses are simply due to theft. 

 Along with theft control measures, we need to set a deadline to upgrade the transmission and distribution system. The government would provide financial assistance to states that are able to reduce these losses to agreed levels.

 Singh said a dedicated, professionally-managed board would be set up to keep track of eleventh plan projects. 

 He was worried that only half of the 41,000mw target could be achieved in the tenth plan period.

 We need a crash programme for capacity addition aimed at eliminating shortages latest by 2012. There should be no slippages or overruns, he added. 

 According to estimates, the sector needs over Rs 600,000 crore to fund the capacity addition and to upgrade the transmission and distribution systems.

 Singh said given the financial constraints, it would be unrealistic to rely totally on either external or public funding. Sufficient private investment is necessary if we have to have any realistic hope of achieving our targets. 

 Time is running out and unless we are able to arrest the growing shortages, the effect on our economy may be disastrous, he said.

 A task force will be set up to develop hydroelectric power projects and look into issues of rehabilitation of people affected by the projects. 

 Inter-state transmission needs to be opened up to competition and a separate and independent government entity set up to control the national load despatch centre, Singh added.

 States should ensure that electricity reaches all villages by 2009, Singh said. 

 He said the cost at which power is being supplied is not on a par with the cost in other countries. 

 The Centre and states have a common obligation to sit together and work out a practical solution to all problems in the power sector.

 He was in favour of competitive tariff based bidding too. A conscious decision to move away from cost plus tariffs towards competitive tariffs in big power projects is going to result in substantial tariff reductions, he added. 

 The power conference decided to set up a standing group of power ministers to look at issues affecting the power sector, Singh said. A sub-committee of the standing group will look at financing issues particularly for upgrading T amp;D networks. The standing group will be headed by power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and the sub-group would be chaired by finance minister P. Chidambaram and include plan panel deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia.

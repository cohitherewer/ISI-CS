The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Boutique touch to Claridges

 GARIMA SINGH NEOGY

 Ready for a facelift

 New Delhi, Sept. 9: Claridges a Delhi landmark plans to become a boutique hotel. The Suresh Nanda-promoted outfit has appointed Peter Leitgeb of Leela Palaces and Resorts as its president and CEO. 

 Leitgeb has 30 years experience in the hospitality industry and he plans to refurbish and reposition the property as a boutique hotel by mid 2009.

 It is an ideal property to be built into a boutique hotel. Research has already begun. The hotel will see a whole lot of changes in the future, said Leitgeb in an exclusive interview to The Telegraph.

 The Claridges is now a 137-room property with basic facilities such as restaurants, a swimming pool, conference halls and a business lounge. 

 Leitgeb said a boutique hotel should be small, exquisite and set in a serene location. The small size will make it easy to manage so that occupants receive personalised service. Perfection and an eye for detail are the keys to success, he said. The hotel will maintain a database of frequent visitors, their tastes and preferences. 

 We will have everything in place right from the visitors favourite food, to personalised bathrobes, preferred brand of perfume, premium tea or coffee, he said. 

 The group is planning to employ designers from Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong and Munich. 

 It may also change its butler service and is looking at companies in the UK.

 The hotel now has three wings with 137 rooms under 11 different categories. We may look at converting two rooms into one or three rooms into two, he said.

 The hotel will also go in for administrative changes. To attract business clients from abroad, the group is considering a sales, marketing and reservation agreement with travel companies in London and Singapore.

 Discerning business travellers who visit a particular city for a few days look out for maximum comfort and personal attention. And they are ready to pay for it. We are targeting travellers in this segment, Leitgeb said. 

 The chain may also sign management contract services for upcoming projects. 

 A hotel always draws travellers on the basis of its brand value. The better the brand value, the higher the occupancy, he said. 

 According to Leitgeb, already three upcoming land developers want the group to manage their hotels. 

 We think its a brilliant idea and also want to do this for better business prospects. We are looking at a time frame of one-and-half years by which we should be signing our first management contract, he said.

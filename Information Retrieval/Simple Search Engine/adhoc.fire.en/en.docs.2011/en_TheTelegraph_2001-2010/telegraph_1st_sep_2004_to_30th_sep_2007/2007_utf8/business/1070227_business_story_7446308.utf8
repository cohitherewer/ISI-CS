 Chennai, Feb. 26: Mahindra amp; Mahindra Limited (M amp;M), Renault of France and Japans Nissan today signed an MoU for a joint venture on a common manufacturing facility at Oragadam near Chennai.

 The plant will have a capacity of four lakh vehicles a year and be set up at an investment of Rs 4,000 crore initially. The plant will make the Logan, Renaults popular sedan, which will be made in partnership with M amp;M, the compact cars of Nissan plus other Mahindra models. The plant will also make 50,000 tractors a year.

 M amp;M chairman Keshub Mahindra said after the signing of the MoU that the joint venture reflected a changing world economy where such tieups are significant in the context of emerging demands in the global market place. While the Mahindras will hold a 50 per cent equity in the joint venture, Renault and Nissan will each hold 25 per cent each. Renault owns 44 per cent stake in Nissan, while the Japanese firm has 15 per cent in the French carmaker.

 He said 50 years ago M amp;M had joined hands with Renault for a small car carrying a price tag of Rs 7,000, which never saw the light of the day because the government refused permission. The Government of India never gave us the permission, but now they (Renault) are our partners, he said. 

 Pawan Goenka, the CEO of M amp;Ms automotive sector, who is also the president of the new venture, said the facility will be spread over 1,100 acres and have an engine plant, a transmission plant, press shop, body shop, an assembly line, a paint shop besides a power train facility for the Logan and the Nissan car.

 Goenka said the joint venture is for manufacturing and not marketing. He said the Logan will be marketed through Mahindras marketing network, while Nissan will hawk its car separately.

 In the wake of the controversy over land acquisition, Keshub Mahindra said the three partners will share the cost of re-locating the families displaced by the project. He said the joint venture will set up a vocational school to train local youths to get jobs in the project. This will be done even during the gestation phase for the project.

 The first of the vehicles will roll out in the second half of 2009. When three companies like this get together, there are no longer national borders, Mahindra said.

 The project will provide direct employment to 5,000, while another 40,000 will get indirect employment at the ancillary units.

 On account of the entry of Nissan, which earlier ended talks with compatriot Suzuki for manufacturing facility in India, the capacity of the new plant could go up to about 8,00,000 cars per year by 2012, an M amp;M official said. 

 The project will result in gross value addition of about Rs 18,000 crore per annum to Tamil Nadus gdp and the additional investment in the state by vendors and supporting service providers was expected to be about Rs 10,000 crore. 

 This project will give a fillip to the manufacturing sector in Tamil Nadu, especially in the area of automobiles and auto components.

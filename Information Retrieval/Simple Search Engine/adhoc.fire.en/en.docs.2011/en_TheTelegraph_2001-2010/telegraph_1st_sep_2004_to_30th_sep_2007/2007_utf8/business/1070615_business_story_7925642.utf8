 Calcutta, June 14: The ministry of commerce and industry will develop five cities, including Calcutta, as centres for leather exports. 

 India plans to export leather worth $7 billion by 2011 compared with $3 billion now.

 While 60 per cent of leather goods such as garments, gloves, bags and wallets are sourced from Calcutta, the state accounts for only 15 per cent of the exports.

 We believe that Calcutta, which sources hides, can account for much more of the leather exports. It can emerge as one of the leaders such as Tamil Nadu, which accounts for 45 per cent, said Jairam Ramesh, minister of state for commerce and industry.

 The other cities to be developed as export hubs are Chennai, Agra, Kanpur and Nellore.

 The minister visited the Bantala leather SEZ in the city. Around 200 tanneries have shifted to Bantala.

 I have requested promoters M/S Dalmiya and stakeholders to set up a footwear and footwear component park across 100 to 120 acres within the leather park, he said. One third of the exports now comprise footwear, which will go up to 60 per cent in the next five years, Ramesh added.

 The Centre would also fund a Rs 10-crore footwear design and development complex in the Bantala SEZ.

 Central assistance

 The Centre will invest Rs 64 crore to fund nine projects worth Rs 68 crore. The state will contribute the remaining funds.

 These include an export cargo complex in Haldia for Rs 6 crore and a flower market at Mullickghat for Rs 26 crore. Both will be operational by March next year. 

 A pineapple processing centre will also come up in Uttar Dinajpur by August 2008 at a cost of Rs 10 crore. A perishable cargo centre at the Calcutta airport will be set up for Rs 7 crore by September this year. A similar cargo complex will come up in Bagdogra.

 Other projects include a potato development and processing centre in Burdwan, a multi-purpose pack house each in Barasat and Malda and a food testing lab in Bidhan Chandra Krishi Vidyalaya in Nadia.

 Indian Oil refinery in Turkey

 Our Special Correspondent

 New Delhi, March 27: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is drawing up plans to set up a $6-billion grassroots refinery at Ceyhan, Turkey, with a capacity to process 15 million tonnes (mt) of crude. The refinery will essentially cater to the European and US markets. 

 IOCs director of business development B.M. Bansal said the company was in talks with Turkish firm Caliak Energi to float a joint venture to take up the project. He said IOC is interested in a 51 per cent stake in the project, which could entail an equity investment of up to $2 million for the Indian firm. 

 Bansal said IOC would also bid for Turkish petrochemicals company Petkim, which is to be divested as part of the ongoing privatisation process in the country. 

 The petrochemicals company fits in well with our plans to set up a refinery and IOC is bidding with this synergy in mind, he added.

 The refinery will produce feedstock such as naphtha, which will be further processed in the petrochemicals unit to add more value.

 While the products of the refinery will be exported, the petrochemicals are expected to be consumed within Turkey as the country does not produce enough to cater to its domestic demand. 

 IOC and Caliak had signed an MoU late last year to explore possibilities of joint collaboration in the downstream space in Turkey and it is keeping this pact in mind while planning its foray into the country.

 A joint collaboration will also be explored for a pipeline project that will bring in the crude to the refinery. The Caliak Energi group is one of Turkeys leading industrial groups with interests in gas distribution, oil exploration, banking and textiles. It also has oil blocks in Turkmenistan.

 IOC and Caliak had earlier bid for the Tupras refinery but were beaten by an aggressive bid by the Shell consortium. Turkey is the gateway to Europe and a presence in this market is expected to be of strategic importance to Indian Oils overseas plans.

 Bansal said the proposed $2-billion Ceyhan-Samsun pip-eline from the Black Sea to the coast of the Mediterranean Sea was also being taken up as a consortium and IOC was keen on picking up a 12.5 per cent stake in the project.

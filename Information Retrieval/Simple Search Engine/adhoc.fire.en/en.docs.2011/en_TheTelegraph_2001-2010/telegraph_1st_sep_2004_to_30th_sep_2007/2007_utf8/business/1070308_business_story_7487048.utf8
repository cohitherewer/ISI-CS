 Mittal talks with Chinese firm fail

 Mittal: Disappointed

 Shanghai, China, March 7 (AP): Arcelor Mittal failed to negotiate an agreement to buy a stake in mid-sized Baotou Iron amp; Steel, the Chinese company today said.

 We are not talking about any actual cooperation anymore, the state-run newspaper China Daily quoted Baotous chairman, Lin Donglu, as saying. A spokeswoman at Baotou Iron amp; Steels headquarters in north Chinas Inner Mongolia confirmed Lins remarks, saying the talks had ended without any result.

 She refused to give her name or comment further. Arcelor SA and Mittal Steel Co NV have agreed on a deal to form the worlds largest steelmaker. Talks with Baotou broke down because the global giant wanted a stake of 50 per cent or more in Baotou, but government policies require the state to keep a controlling share in such industries, Lin was quoted as saying.

 But he said Baotou would continue talks on technical cooperation with Arcelor Mittal, another newspaper, China Business News, cited Lin as saying. Baotou may also seek local partners, including Shanghai-based Baosteel, the countrys biggest steel mill, Lin said. He said Baotou was mulling selling shares in Hong Kong, possibly within this year.

 The news followed an announcement on Tuesday by speciality steelmaker Hunan Valin Steel Tube amp; Wire Co that it would issue new shares to Arcelor Mittal, which holds a 29.5 per cent stake. Arcelor Mittal is due to take about half of the share issue, raising its stake in Hunan Valin to 33 per cent, reports said.

 Mittal also is reportedly in talks with Kunming Iron amp; Steel Co, the biggest steelmaker in the southwestern province of Yunnan.

 Baotou Iron amp; Steel, founded in 1954 in north Chinas Inner Mongolia, is a medium-sized steelmaker and also is Chinas biggest producer of rare earth products.

 China is the worlds biggest steel producer and consumer, using about a third of all steel produced worldwide, but foreign investment in its domestic industry remains limited. 

 The government is pushing small and medium-sized steelmakers to tie up with larger ones to help improve competitiveness and upgrade technology.

 KK Modi bets big on retail expansion

 GARIMA SINGH

 New Delhi, March 4: Modi Enterprises, part of the Rs 2,500-crore KK Modi Group, is planning to raise around Rs 585 crore to fund its retail expansion plans.

 We need about Rs 585 crore ($100-130 million) to expand our convenience stores, Twenty-Four Seven. The money will most likely be raised in the second quarter of the current year, managing director Samir Modi told The Telegraph.

 Declining to give more details, he said, It could be either through issuing a foreign currency convertible bond (FCCB) or floating an IPO. The route has not been decided yet.

 The company, which opened its first store in July last year, runs five such convenience stores in the north. The aim is to open around 1,000 stores across the country by 2012. As one-stop shops for essential services, these stores help customers pay their bills and offer courier services, film development, pharmacy and ready-to-eat and packaged foods. 

 Modi said the Twenty-Four Seven stores have been built on the lines of the Seven Eleven chain abroad. The Seven Eleven stores started in the US and has spread to more than 70 countries. 

 Modi Enterprises, which has invested around Rs 15 crore in Twenty-Four Seven, is aiming a turnover of Rs 150 crore in 2007-08, said Modi. This is against Rs 14 crore the company is hoping to clock this fiscal.

 We have set a high turnover target for next fiscal since 80 new stores will be operational by March 2008, said Modi.

 Responding to a query on how the company plans to compete with retail giants such as Reliance Retail and Bharti-Wal-Mart, Modi said, We operate in the mom-and-pop space. These are 24-hour convenience-based small stores selling a large number of goods. They (Reliance Retail and Wal-Mart) are not our real competitors.

 The group aims to convert all the mom-and-pop stores into our franchisees and allow them to compete, he added.

 To gauge the viability of opening such a large number of stores, the company is testing various formats with different sizes. We have tested space from the highly residential to highly commercial to a mix of commercial-residential, said Modi.

 Glaxo profit set to take dollar hit

 Hard to swallow

 London, Feb. 3 (Reuters): Currency moves are expected to hold back fourth-quarter profits at GlaxoSmithKline. Europes biggest drugmaker faces a tough 2007 as generics bite and new rivals appear for top sellers, Advair and Avandia. 

 However, despite dollar weakness in the last quarter, Glaxo should easily meet its target of growing 2006 earnings per share at a mid-teens percentage rate in constant exchange rate terms, according to industry analysts.

 Glaxo, which reports on Thursday, is susceptible to US currency moves because it is its biggest market. 

 Actual 2006 earnings per share are expected to rise 15.6 per cent to 95.5 pence, according to the average forecast in a Reuters poll of 19 analysts. Guidance for 2007, though, is likely to be a lot more cautious, with growth in top-selling asthma drug Advair slowing and the product facing competition from AstraZenecas Symbicort in the US market from around mid-year. 

 Glaxos second biggest seller, Avandia for diabetes, also has to compete with new rivals in the form of Merck amp; Cos newly introduced Januvia and Novartiss Galvus, which is expected to be approved soon. 

 At the same time, Glaxo faces hits from generic competition to anti-nausea drug Zofran and anti-depressant Wellbutrin XL. 

 The market is going to need some reassurance, especially on Advair, said Nomura Code analyst Paul Diggle, commenting on the outlook for 2007.

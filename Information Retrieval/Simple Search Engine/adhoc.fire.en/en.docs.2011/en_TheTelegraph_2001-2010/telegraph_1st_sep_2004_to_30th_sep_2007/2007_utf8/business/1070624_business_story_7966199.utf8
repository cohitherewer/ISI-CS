 BSNL staff body rings warning bell

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Put on hold

 Calcutta, June 23: Sanchar Nigam Executives Association (India), a BSNL staff body, today expressed its concern over the companys delay in executing the global tender order for 45.5 million GSM connections. 

 BSNL needs to put in place the infrastructure necessary to provide the connections by 2010 because it has almost exhausted its installed capacity of 2.79 crore GSM lines. 

 A court case delaying the tender was vacated by Delhi High Court in April, but BSNL is yet to place the order with the lowest bidders Ericsson and Nokia for the first phase. 

 The procurement process is time-consuming but if the issue is not taken up immediately, we stand to lose a huge share of the market, said Dilip Saha, regional president of the association.

 While the private operators added more than 15 lakh connections to their subscriber base, BSNL struggled to provide two to three lakh lines, he added.

 BSNL has more than three lakh employees. The association has 50,000 executives and 35,000 other staff as its members.

 The eastern region has an installed capacity of 51 lakh lines of which 48 lakh connections have been provided.

 Bengal, with a capacity of 10.13 lakh lines, has already provided connections in excess of 10.6 lakh. 

 In such a situation, capacity expansion should be given the highest priority, Saha said.

 BSNL has slipped to the fourth position with a subscriber base of 27.9 million. 

 Bharti Airtel tops the list with 40.7 million users, followed by Reliance Communications (30.5 million) and Hutchison Essar (29.2 million).

 BSNLs profits were hit because of a cut in access deficit charge. Moreover, private operators claimed a share of the universal service obligation fund.

 The telecom company is vying for the navaratna status. This will give the BSNL board the autonomy to invest up to Rs 1,000 crore on expansion without prior approval from the finance ministry. This will help the company use its reserves of Rs 40,000 crore.

 Deora seal on new ONGC gas find

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Its for sure

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: Petroleum minister Murli Deora today confirmed ONGCs latest gas finds in the KG basin off the Andhra coast and the Mahanadi basin in the Orissa offshore region. 

 I can confirm a huge gas find in ultra deepwater in KG basin and a commercial discovery in the Mahanadi basin, Deora said.

 The minister said, We are 90 per cent sure that gas has been found. I was supposed to make an announcement at the inauguration of Petrotechs conference on January 16, but since testing had not been done, we refrained from making it public.

 ONGC chairman R.S. Sharma said the KG well with a water depth of 2,840 metres was still to reach its target but initial testing in the presence of DGH officials has confirmed the presence of natural gas.

 He said 6,600 metres have already been explored and the target depth of 7,000 metres would be reached in the next two weeks. ONGC will drill four or five more appraisal wells before it can announce the size of the discovery and the reserves it holds, he said.

 Production from such deepwater wells is a technological challenge and we are in talks with Petrobras of Brazil, Italys ENI, Norsk Hydro of Norway and UKs BG for a strategic tie-up, Sharma said.

 The company is willing to offer the partner equity stake in the KG-DWN-98/2 block, he added.

 On the Mahanadi gas find, he said the gas discovery was of commercial nature but reserve estimates can be put only after few more wells are drilled.

 Senior ONGC officials said, Based purely on the seismic data, the ONGC KG-DWN-98/2 block could turn out to be bigger than the giant Reliance gas field.

 According to them, more wells will have to be drilled to find out if this was actually the case. At least seven to eight wells will have to be spudded before an accurate estimate of the in-place gas reserves can be made. We are keeping our fingers crossed and hoping for the best, a senior official said. 

 It could take several months to arrive at a realistic estimate of the reserves, a senior official said. ONGC holds 90 per cent operating interest in the KG basin block. The stake was acquired from Cairn India, which now holds 10 per cent in the block. 

 HPCL refinery

 Hindustan Petroleum may sell up to 51 per cent stake in its upcoming refinery at Vizag in Andhra Pradesh to Total SA of France.

 We are in talks with Total for a possible partnership in the expansion at our Vizag refinery, HPCL chairman M.B. Lal said. Lal will meet Total chief executive officer Thierry Desmarest for talks on the planned stake sale.

 HPCL is expanding its Vizag refinery from the current 7.5 mt per year to 9 mt and building another export-oriented 9 mt refinery adjacent to it.

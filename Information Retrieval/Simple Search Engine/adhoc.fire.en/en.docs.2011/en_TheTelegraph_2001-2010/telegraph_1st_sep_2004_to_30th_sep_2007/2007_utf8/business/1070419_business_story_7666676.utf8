 One more PSU ready to tap market

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 18: Bharat Earth Movers Ltd (BEML) today became the second public sector unit after National Hydroelectric Power Corporation Ltd (NHPC) to unveil plans to raise money from the capital market this year.

 BEML has filed a draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India for a follow-on offering of 49 lakh shares.

 NHPC had kickstarted the process by announcing plans to tap the capital market with an initial public offering (IPO) that comprises a fresh issue of over 111 crore shares by the company and an offer for sale of over 55.86 crore shares by the government. After the IPO, the governments stake in the power utility will go down to 86.30 per cent.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram has projected divestment proceeds of Rs 41,651 crore this fiscal a level that has never been reached since the process of liberalisation started in 1991. 

 Last year, the government raised just Rs 529 crore through the sale of shares of some PSUs. In the past decade, the highest amount garnered through divestment was Rs 16,953 crore in 2003-04.

 In the case of BEML, the government holding is expected to fall to 54 per cent after the issue. The company has reserved 4.90 lakh shares for eligible employees and the net issue to the public will be 44.10 lakh shares.

 The money raised from the issue will be used to part-finance the expansion of the metro coach manufacturing facility in Bangalore and meet BEMLs capital expenditure needs. BEML also intends to use a part of the proceeds to set up a 5-mw wind mill.

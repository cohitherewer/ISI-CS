 September date for PowerGrid flotation

 Mumbai, Aug. 22 (PTI): Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd today filed its red herring prospectus with market regulator Sebi for an initial public offering to raise around Rs 3,500 crore.

 The company is likely to hit the market with the issue in the second week of September. Sources said the IPO could be priced at around Rs 50-70, taking the total proceeds to roughly Rs 3,500 crore and giving it a market value of over Rs 20,000 crore.

 The offer will constitute 10 per cent of fresh equity, comprising 38.26 crore shares, and a sale of 5 per cent stake by the government that will amount to 19.13 crore shares. Of the 57.39 crore shares, 1.39 crore have been reserved for employees.

 PowerGrid is the third central power utility to tap the capital market after the NTPC in 2004 and the Power Finance Corporation early this year. Like the NTPC and the PFC, the government will piggyback on the PowerGrid issue to divest 5 per cent of its stake. The NTPC had raised around Rs 5,400 crore and the PFC had mopped up nearly Rs 1,000 crore.

 PowerGrid is raising funds from the market to part-finance its expenditure. The transmission sector requires an estimated investment of Rs 70,000 crore in the Eleventh Plan and central utilities led by PowerGrid are expected to contribute around Rs 50,000 crore.

 The company will issue shares at a price to be decided through book building, and the shares will be listed on the BSE and the NSE.

 Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, Citigroup Global Markets India and Enam Financial Consultants are the book running lead managers to the issue.

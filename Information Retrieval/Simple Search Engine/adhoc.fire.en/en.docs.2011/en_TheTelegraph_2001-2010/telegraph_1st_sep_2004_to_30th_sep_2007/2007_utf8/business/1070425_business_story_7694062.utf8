 Mutual funds can invest more abroad

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 24: Mutual funds planning to float global investment schemes are in clover: the Reserve Bank of India has raised the overseas investment limit by the industry to $4 billion a year from $3 billion at present.

 In its annual policy statement for 2007-08, the RBI said this was being done to provide greater opportunities to the sector to invest in overseas markets.

 The relief comes at a time when two funds have already announced schemes that will allow individuals to invest in various geographies. Several others, including UTI Asset Management Company, are planning to float similar schemes. Kotak Asset Management has already joined hands with US-based T. Rowe Price, to launch a fund that would invest in T Rowe Price Funds-Global Emerging Markets Equity Fund.

 The proceeds will be invested in the global emerging markets equity fund. This fund invests primarily in a widely diversified global portfolio of equity and equity-related securities of companies that are either based in or have a large part of their business activities in the emerging economies of Latin America, Asia, Europe, Africa and West Asia.

 Fidelity Fund Management recently launched its first international offering called the Fidelity International Opportunities Fund.

 Ashu Suyash, managing director and country head of Fidelity Fund Management, said, The increase in the overall limit for the mutual fund industry for overseas investment from $3 billion to $4 billion and a 100 per cent increase in the limit for remittances overseas for individuals to $100,000 are strong signals that we are well set on the course to overseas investing.

 Suyash, however, said the industry is looking forward to notification of guidelines which will make investing overseas through mutual funds simpler for investors. The industry is now waiting for detailed guidelines from Sebi. We are keenly awaiting the guidelines that will tell us how much the individual fund house limits will go up after todays announcement, she added.

 Such funds are expected to see a good response as it gives Indian investors an opportunity to increase returns and also diversify their portfolio from the domestic markets. The minimum investment in a fund is expected to rise after the hike in the overall investment limit.

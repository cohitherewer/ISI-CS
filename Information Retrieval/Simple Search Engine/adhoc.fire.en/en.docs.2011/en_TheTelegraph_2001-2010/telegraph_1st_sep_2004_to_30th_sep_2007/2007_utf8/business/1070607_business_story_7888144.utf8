 Sensex slide show

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 6: The sensex today plummeted by around 280 points on fears of a hike in interest rates by the European Central Bank. 

 The bank later raised the rates by 25 basis points.

 Investors also rushed to sell blue chip shares as they felt interest rate tightening measures in India were not yet over. 

 Brokers said profit booking was more pronounced towards the last couple of trading hours.

 While the benchmark index experienced a 300-point intra-day plunge, blue chips, including Tata Steel, HDFC, Tata Motors, State Bank, Reliance Industries, ONGC, Reliance Energy, Bhel, Ranbaxy and ICICI Bank, were the major losers. 

 Tata Motors slumped by 3.87 per cent, ONGC by 3.05 per cent, HDFC by 3.5 per cent, State Bank by 3.35 per cent, ICICI Bank by 3.02 per cent and Bhel by 3.09 per cent.

 The sensex, which opened at 14551.53, up marginally from its previous close of 14535.01, touched an intra-day high of 14590.82. 

 A heavy selloff saw the index slump to the days low of 14234.07, after which it closed at 14255.93, down 279.08 points, or 1.9 per cent. This was the biggest single-day fall since April 27, when the sensex plunged 320.30 points.

 Analysts believe that investors have turned sceptical about FIIs and were somewhat discouraged by the trends in overseas markets. 

 FIIs, which were net buyers in the past several days, turned sellers and extracted sizeable chunks of funds during the sessions. 

 Investors are also pulling out funds to be able to bid for the initial public offerings lined up this month. 

 These include offerings from DLF and ICICI Bank.

 Analysts, however, are bullish on the market in the long run. Todays fall can be mainly attributed to a hike in rates by the European Central Bank. 

 Although liquidity can become a concern again, the bearish trend is temporary. We have two big IPOs next week DLF and ICICI Bank and it will be only then that the market will have a clear picture of liquidity. We will also see the end of the results season next week, Manish Sonthalia, vice-president (market strategist) at Motilal Oswal, said.

 Airline merger set to be airborne

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: The ministry of corporate affairs is likely to issue a notification tomorrow on the merger of Air India and Indian (erstwhile Indian Airlines).

 Officials said the ministry decided to go ahead with the merger despite objections from the unions of the two airlines, including the pilots guild. The two airlines will be merged to form National Aviation Company of India Ltd and will use the Air India brand name.

 The two state-run carriers had sought the ministrys permission to merge. The Companies Act, 1956 gives the ministry powers to allow merger of PSUs. Private companies can merge only if a high court permits.

 The ministrys approval came despite objections raised by the employees and staff unions. In a public hearing on July 31, more than 17 complaints on wage revision, arrears and pensions were filed.

 The unions had said all dues and arrears should be cleared before the merger. Union officials said they planned to take their fight to court. 

 The unions said issues such as pay arrears and promotions were yet to be sorted out. 

 In March, the cabinet gave its approval to a plan on merging the two state-run airlines. The combined turnover of the two airlines in 2006 was about Rs 14,700 crore. 

 The profit was Rs 58 crore, the lions share of which came from Indian.

 The finance ministry has also approved an amendment to the income tax act that will allow Air India and Indian to carry forward unabsorbed depreciation once they are merged. 

 Normal provisions of the act do not allow merged companies in the airline business to carry forward their tax and unabsorbed depreciation.

 Air Indias net worth before the merger was Rs 403.27 crore while that of Indian was (-) Rs 217.98 crore. Their combined net worth after the merger is, however, expected to increase to Rs 2,557.49 crore.

 The merged entity will fly on domestic and international routes. It will have the combined fleet of the two airlines, comprising 100 Airbuses and Boeings. 

 Subsidiary functions such as engineering and maintenance, ground handling, cargo and low-cost airlines will function as separate business units under the new company.

 The merged entity will be the largest airline in India and can be compared with Asian airlines such as Singapore Airlines (118 planes), Emirates (93) and Malaysian Airlines (110).

 Before the merger was contemplated, Indian had decided to buy 43 Airbus planes at an estimated cost of Rs 9,000 crore. Air India and its low-cost subsidiary, AI Express, agreed to buy some 68 Boeing aircraft estimated to cost nearly Rs 35,000 crore.

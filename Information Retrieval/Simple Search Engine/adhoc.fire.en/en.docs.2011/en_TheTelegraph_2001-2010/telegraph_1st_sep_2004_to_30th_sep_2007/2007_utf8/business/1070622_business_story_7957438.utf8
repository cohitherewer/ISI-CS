 Stage set for Mittal refinery stake

 Mittal: Winning streak

 New Delhi, June 21: The Union cabinet today gave the green signal to L.N. Mittals plans for a 49 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporations grassroots refinery at Bhatinda in Punjab. 

 The proposal has been hanging fire since March as the prevailing policy sets a 26 per cent cap on foreign direct investment in public sector refineries. 

 An exception has been made for Mittal who will now pump in Rs 3,506 crore for his 49 per cent stake in the 9-million-tonne refinery. HPCLs equity stake in the Rs 18,919-crore project is also 49 per cent, while financial institutions will hold the balance 2 per cent. 

 This joint venture will be the largest FDI in collaboration with a public sector company in the downstream refining sector. This will enhance the availability of petroleum products in the north, information and broadcasting minister P.R. Das Munshi said after the cabinet meeting.

 Oil minister Murli Deora, who had supported Mittals case, said the approval paved the way for the speedy implementation of the project, which has the potential to create many jobs.

 The project, which has been hanging fire for the last seven-eight years, will now see the light of the day, Deora said. An oil ministry statement said, Work on the refinery project will now be put on the fast track and Mittals investment will allow HPCL to use its capital for other planned expenditure. HPCL will also leverage the strength of Mittal Investments Sarl for globalising its operations as well as seeking oil equity abroad. Mittal Investments Sarl is the investment arm of the LN Mittal group.

 Mittal has a joint venture with ONGC to acquire overseas oil and gas assets. The combine has bagged some exploration blocks in oil-rich Nigeria. In ONGC-Mittal Energy Ltd, the PSU holds 51 per cent of the 98 per cent stake in the company, while Mittal Investments Sarl holds 49 per cent. The remaining 2 per cent is with financial institutions.

 The duo have also signed an MoU for a venture in the trading of oil and gas, including LNG. The company, ONGC Mittal Energy Services Ltd, will have a shareholding pattern similar to ONGC-Mittal Energy.

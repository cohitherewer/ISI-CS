 Cerberus Capital to take control of Chrysler

 Stuttgart/Frankfurt, May 14 (Agencies): DaimlerChrysler will sell a controlling interest in its struggling Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital Management of New York, a private equity firm that specialises in restructuring troubled companies. The price being paid is $7.4 billion, mostly in the form of capital that Cerberus will put into Chrysler. 

 The deal unwinds a 1998 merger that was meant to create a trans-Atlantic automotive powerhouse. 

 The agreement will leave DaimlerChrysler with a 19.9 per cent stake in Chrysler. DaimlerChrysler will change its name to Daimler AG. It will be freed of a great amount of pension and health care liabilities in the new Chrysler company. 

 Cerberus will take an 80.1 per cent stake in the new company, to be known as Chrysler Holding. 

 With the deal, Chrysler becomes the first of the big Detroit automakers to be privately owned. The prospect of private ownership had alarmed Chryslers labour unions, which had come out strongly against the sale of the company, fearful that an investor might try to break up the company or seek deep cuts in wages and benefits. 

 But Ron Gettelfinger, president of the United Automobile Workers union, said today that the deal was in the best interests of our UAW members, the Chrysler Group and Daimler.

 Of the $7.4 billion, Cerberus agreed to invest $5 billion in the new Chrysler and $1.05 billion in Chryslers financial arm. The remaining $1.35 billion will go to DaimlerChrysler.

 DaimlerChryslers share of the capital represents a remarkable comedown for a company that paid $36 billion to acquire Chrysler in 1998, in a landmark deal that was initially hailed as a blueprint for the future of the global auto industry. 

 As part of the complicated sale today, DaimlerChrysler has agreed to lend Chrysler Holding $400 million and will absorb $1.6 billion in costs, related to the ongoing restructuring programme at Chrysler. All told, the company said, it would have a net cash outflow of $650 million from the transaction. 

 DaimlerChrysler, however, will transfer nearly $20 billion in pension and health care obligations for Chryslers workers to the new company. That will leave Daimler as a smaller, but financially stronger company. 

 Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of DaimlerChrysler, said, Were confident that weve found the right solution that will create the greatest overall value both for Daimler and Chrysler. 

 Cerberus chairman John W. Snow, said, We would like to think DaimlerChrysler for their good stewardship of this American icon over the last decade. We are aware that Chrysler faces significant challenges, but we are confident that they can and will be overcome. Snow is the former United States treasury secretary.

 Cerberus is the right strategic buyer for Chrysler, with a long-term commitment to Chryslers growth and success. They are committed to working constructively with both the union leadership and Chryslers management team to help Chrysler realise its full potential, Chrysler president Tom LaSorda said.

 The deal is expected to be finalised in the third quarter.

 The deal will not trigger any job cuts beyond the 13,000 Chrysler announced in February, when it unveiled a $1.5-billion operating loss for 2006 as customers, spooked by high fuel prices, fled its line-up of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.

 The DaimlerChrysler stock rose as much as 7.8 per cent on the news.

 Cerberus has experience with the auto industry. General Motors sold a 51 per cent stake in its financing arm, GMAC, to a consortium led by Cerberus in a deal worth about $14 billion last year.

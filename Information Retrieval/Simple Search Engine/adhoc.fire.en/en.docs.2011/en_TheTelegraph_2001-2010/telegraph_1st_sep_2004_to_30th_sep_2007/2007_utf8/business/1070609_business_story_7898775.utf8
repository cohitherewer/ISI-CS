 Inflation dips, rate cut hopes rise

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 8: The inflation rate fell below the 5 per cent mark to 4.85 per cent for the first time in eight months, in line with the RBIs objectives. 

 Reserve Bank governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy today said in Mumbai the objective was to keep the rate close to 5 per cent this fiscal and bring it down to 4-4.5 per cent in the medium term.

 Finance ministry officials said if inflation remained in control, there should be no need to raise interest rates any further. In fact, after some period of time we may see the rates softening. 

 North Block officials said the money tightening measures of the RBI along with lower import duties led to the fall in prices.

 To check inflation, the central bank has raised its interest rates five times since last June. Reserve requirements of banks were also raised thrice since December.

 Taking the cue, banks had raised their lending rates which had an impact on the demand for automobiles and consumer durables.

 To improve the supply of some essential items, the government had cut petrol and diesel prices and reduced the import duty on some capital goods and farm products.

 The inflation rate at 4.85 per cent for the week ended May 26 was lower than the previous weeks 5.06 per cent. 

 The higher availability of wheat, fruits and vegetables as well as edible oils cooled down prices.

 Inflation had even crossed 6.5 per cent some time back and was an issue during the elections in four states. Along with the shortages, there was a rise in consumer demand caused by a buoyant economy which grew by 9.4 per cent last fiscal. The net result of this situation was inflationary pressures, said S.P. Gupta, former member of the Planning Commission.

 Reddy today said the RBI was fine-tuning the inflation indicators by including information such as variability of output and capacity utilisation. He was addressing a meeting of Banco Central de Chile, the central bank of Chile, on Thursday.

 Re falls 43 paise

 The rupee today tumbled by 43 paise and ended at a four-week low of 41.14 against the dollar. This was because of sustained dollar buying by PSU banks on behalf of the RBI.

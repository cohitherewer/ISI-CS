 Overseas loan rules tightened

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 7: The finance ministry today imposed a limit of $20 million on the inflow of fresh borrowings by companies from abroad.

 Beyond this sum, the funds will have to be parked abroad for the purchase of plant and machinery, which can be brought into the country.

 These funds can also be used to buy assets and repay foreign loans.

 Borrowers raising external commercial borrowings (ECB) more than $20 million shall park the proceeds overseas for use as foreign currency expenditure for permissible end-uses, said a finance ministry statement.

 The limit is valid for external commercial borrowings both under the automatic route and under the approval route.

 The ECB policy changes have been administered to curtail the inflow of foreign currency into India and check the surplus liquidity in the system, said K. Raghuraman, executive director of Punjab National Bank.

 Since a borrower is unable to convert some foreign currency into rupee, it will weaken the value of the rupee vis--vis the dollar, Raghuraman said.

 For ECBs up to $20 million, prior permission is necessary from the Reserve Bank of India for expenditure within the country.

 However, the ministry said, the money can be kept abroad till its actual requirement in the country.

 Other ECB norms have been kept unchanged by the government. 

 These include allowing a company to raise up to $500 million every year, the criteria for eligible borrowers and recognised lenders, average maturity period for a loan, all-in-cost ceiling, rules relating to refinancing and reporting arrangements.

 New conditions will not apply to borrowers who have already entered into loan agreements and obtained loan registration numbers from the Reserve Bank.

 The move is likely to benefit software, pharmaceutical and textile companies.

 Huge inflows of dollars arising from ECBs have resulted in the appreciation of the rupee, affecting the margins of various industries.

 A rising rupee has a direct impact on the margins of IT industry. For every percentage point rise in the value of the rupee, margins are hit to the tune of 50 basis points. 

 Analysts said there could be a knee-jerk reaction in the forex markets tomorrow, with the rupee opening weak. 

 The Indian currency today ended steady at 40.42 against the dollar. 

 Senior IDBI official U. Venkataraman told The Telegraph that the rupee could breach the Rs 40.50 level tomorrow. 

 He said the movement of the rupee would also be determined by Asian stock markets and the dollars movement against other currencies. 

 Banks are also likely to benefit from the ECB-rule tweak. 

 The demand for rupee-denominated loans is expected to rise as companies find overseas borrowings more expensive.

 Overseas borrowing costs have already inched up due to credit market worries. This coupled with restrictions on ECBs can lead to higher demand for rupee loans, a senior official from a private sector bank said.

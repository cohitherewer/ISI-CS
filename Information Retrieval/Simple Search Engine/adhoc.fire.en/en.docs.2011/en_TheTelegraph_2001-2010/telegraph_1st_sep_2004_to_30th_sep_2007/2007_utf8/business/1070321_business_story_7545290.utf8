 More naphtha for Dabhol

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 20: The government is planning to operate another unit of the Dabhol power project on naphtha from May.

 Although Petronet and GAIL (India) Limited have assured that they will be able to source LNG, the government does not want to leave anything to chance, anticipating difficulties in sourcing natural gas at affordable prices. 

 The decision to go in for more naphtha is being taken to partly overcome the massive electricity shortages in Maharashtra at the peak of summer. 

 The second unit of Ratnagiri power project (Dabhol) will begin its operations from the end of May. The units might run on naphtha due to shortage in gas supply. The government has already exempted the fuel from excise duty, power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said here today.

 The third unit will only begin operating in November, as it was in a state of considerable disrepair, he added.

 Shinde was addressing a two-day conference on Emerging Investment Opportunities in the South Asian Power Sector, conducted by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 Naphtha is an expensive fuel and the tariff from these units is expected to be Rs 5.10 paise per unit. 

 Ratnagiri Gas and Power Private Limited, the new owner of the 2,150-mw project, had restarted one unit of 740 mw on naphtha in May last year after a five-year gap.

 All the three units were to be switched over to gas earlier this year, but the plan had to be postponed due to the non-availability of gas. 

 Apart from the existing unit, another unit of equal capacity will be utilised to generate power as Maharashtra is facing acute shortage of up to 5,000 mw in the peak hours. 

 The minister also said the issue of funding the revival scheme, power purchase agreement as well as gas supply agreement would be finalised today.

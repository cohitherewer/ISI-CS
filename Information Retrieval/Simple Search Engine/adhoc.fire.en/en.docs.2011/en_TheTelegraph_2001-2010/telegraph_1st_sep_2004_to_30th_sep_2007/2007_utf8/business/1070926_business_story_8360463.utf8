 Agarwal: Big plans

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: Emami Limited will invest Rs 150 crore in its subsidiary, Emami Realty Ltd, in the next two years.

 The city-based FMCG major is expecting a growth of up to 20 per cent in its revenues for 2007-08 against 26 per cent last fiscal. The revenue for 2006-07 was Rs 516 crore.

 We will construct over 50 lakh square feet of commercial and residential space. We have identified 10 projects, comprising four IT parks, three shopping malls and three residential complexes in Calcutta, Coimbatore and Hyderabad, said R.S. Agarwal, chairman of Emami, at the companys annual general meeting in the city today.

 Emami is looking at acquisitions at home and abroad in the consumer goods segment.

 It also plans to introduce new products in the mens, baby and hair care sections.

 The new as well as the old products are expected to contribute to the revenues this fiscal, Agarwal said.

 The company has opted for a conservative growth outlook this fiscal because of competition in the consumer goods sector.

 Emami will also invest Rs 100 crore in brand promotion.

 The funds will be raised through a combination of internal accrual and debts.

 Around 80 per cent of the companys production comes from excise-exempt zones.

 The companys income from exports is expected to rise by 30 per cent this fiscal. It rose 40 per cent to Rs 56 crore in the last financial year. 

 The company has also tied up with ITCs e-choupal and Maharashtras post amp; telegraph department for retailing in rural areas.

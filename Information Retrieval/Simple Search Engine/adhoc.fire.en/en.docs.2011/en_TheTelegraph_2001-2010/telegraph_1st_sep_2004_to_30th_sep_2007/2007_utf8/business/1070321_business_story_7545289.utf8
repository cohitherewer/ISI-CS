 New Delhi, March 20: US secretary of energy Samuel W. Bodman today said the Indo-US civil nuclear agreement should not be viewed as a threat in any way to Indias sovereignty or its nuclear programme. 

 The opposite is true ... it is a major opportunity. In fact, I believe in this respect India and the United States need each other, he added while addressing the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 Bodman said, India is a world-class designer, developer and builder of nuclear technology. The talent and creativity of your scientific community is unsurpassed. Indias achievements are truly remarkable, given that it has advanced independently of the larger international nuclear community.

 Therefore, it is clear that the US has much to learn and much to gain from closer nuclear cooperation with India. And it is clear that the rest of the world will also benefit from Indias active engagement in advancing nuclear technology and on international non-proliferation efforts, he added.

 Bodman said, At the same time, the US is home to the worlds most powerful economy, and home to some of the worlds most advanced industries. We too have made great advances in technology, safety and security that can greatly benefit India in this arena.

 But for our countries to fully realise the mutual benefits of this relationship, we must continue the negotiations on the civil nuclear agreement and push forward with the necessary next steps, the US energy secretary said.

 Emphasising the need to diversify the energy portfolio by expanding the use of alternative and renewable sources, he said, I believe, as does President Bush, that the civil nuclear agreement, which is under negotiation, is good for India. Is good for the US. Is good for mutual energy security and is good for the global non-proliferation system.

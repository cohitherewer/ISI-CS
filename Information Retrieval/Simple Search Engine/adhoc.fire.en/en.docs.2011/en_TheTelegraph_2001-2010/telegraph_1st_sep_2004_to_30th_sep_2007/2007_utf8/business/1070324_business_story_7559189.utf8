 State Bank hunger for cash grows

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 More and more

 Mumbai, March 23: The State Bank of India, the countrys largest commercial lender, has increased the size of its minimum term note (MTN) programme to $5 billion from $2 billion.

 The funds would be raised from overseas markets, including London, and would be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange, SBI has informed the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 The programme was updated and its scope enlarged to include raising of funds for capital purposes and for the inclusion of Nassau or other foreign offices, including London, for the purpose of issuance of notes in October 2006, the bank said.

 SBI has launched the programme in 2004 for $1 billion and has enlarged it to $2 billion in August 2005, it said.

 Over the years, SBI, like its peers, both private and nationalised, has been rapidly expanding its international operations to not only cater to NRIs but also to harness the potential from India Incs growing overseas presence.

 SBI now has more than 50 offices in over 34 countries. It has also acquired three international banks. It had picked up a 51 per cent stake in the Mauritius-based Indian Ocean International Bank (IOIB) and 76 per cent of Indonesias PT Bank IndoMonex. 

 Though these banks were acquired during the tenure of A.K. Purwar, SBIs current chairman .P. Bhatt has indicated that the bank is taking a re-look at its international plans. He has said SBI will not acquire small banks and that it will go in for an overseas acquisition only if it is a large bank.

 Sources said SBI now wants to focus largely on organic growth outside India and that the focus will be on consolidating the set-up and on profitability.

 SBI is not the only bank to come out with such overseas bond issues. Private banks like ICICI Bank and UTI Bank have come out with MTN issues to fund their international operations. 

 ICICI Bank, the countrys second largest bank, has often said apart from retail lending, international operations is one of the key focus areas going ahead. On the other hand, UTI Bank has been expanding its international reach. The third largest private sector bank in India recently opened a full licence branch in Hong Kong to offer a range of products and solutions to corporate houses and individuals.

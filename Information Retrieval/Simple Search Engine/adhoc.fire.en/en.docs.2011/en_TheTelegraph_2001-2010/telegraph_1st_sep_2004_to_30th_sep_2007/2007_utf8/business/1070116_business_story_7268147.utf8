 Wal-Mart venture with Bharti okayed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Green signal

 New Delhi, Jan. 15: The commerce ministry has given its final clearance to global retail major Wal-Mart for a joint venture with Bharti.

 The government had decided to re-examine the proposal after the Left parties opposed the deal on the ground that it violated the countrys FDI norms and would displace local retail stores. 

 A senior commerce ministry official said, We have examined the Bharti-Wal-Mart joint venture and found it to be in conformity with the existing FDI retail policy.

 Since the government had put FDI in wholesale cash-and-carry on the automatic route last year, the Bharti-Wal-Mart project does not require any government approval. This route is open to others as well, the official said.

 The decision would pave the way for other retail majors such as Tesco of the UK and Carrefour of France, which are also looking for Indian partners to set up retail chains in the country. 

 Following criticism by the Left parties, commerce minister Kamal Nath said the joint venture between Wal-Mart and the Bharti group would be allowed only if it confirmed with the countrys FDI rules and regulations.

 While India has not allowed FDI in multi-brand retail, foreign investment is permitted in wholesale trade as well as logistics and back-end support. However, the commerce ministry is now drawing up plans to allow FDI in retail multi-brand goods in some speciality sectors such as electronics and sports goods.

 Wal-Mart has been accused by critics of making a backdoor entry into the burgeoning Indian retail market through its tie-up with Bharti.

 Nath had also said the government would see whether farmers would benefit due to the agreement and what impact it could have on neighbourhood stores.

 According to the arrangement between the two companies, Bharti would manage the front-end of the business, while Wal-Mart would take care of the supply chain, logistics and other back-end operations.

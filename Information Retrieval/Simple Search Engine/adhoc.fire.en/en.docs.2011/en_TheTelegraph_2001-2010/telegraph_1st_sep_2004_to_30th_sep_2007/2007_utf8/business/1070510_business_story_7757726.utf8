 AllBank scheme to help senior citizens

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mahajan: Showing concern

 Calcutta, May 9: Allahabad Bank will launch a reverse mortgage product soon.

 We are ready with the product plan, but are awaiting final clarification from the Reserve Bank on whether reverse mortgage lending will also be included in the banks overall exposure to the real estate sector, said A.C. Mahajan, chairman and managing director of Allahabad Bank. 

 The RBI clarification is expected soon and we will launch the product in a month or two, Mahajan added.

 In his budget proposal for 2007-08, finance minister P. Chidambaram had announced that National Housing Bank would introduce reverse mortgage for senior citizens, under which the house owner can avail of a monthly income while remaining the owner of and occupying the house.

 Reverse mortgage works in a way exactly the opposite of housing loans. 

 Under this system, senior citizens mortgage their properties and receive a loan. 

 The value of the loan is calculated on the basis of the fair market value of the property. 

 The loan, including the interest payable there on, is disbursed to the customer in the form of regular monthly payments. 

 The owner of the property does not make any payment for the loan in his or her lifetime and all interest is added to the lien on the property. 

 After the death of the owner, either the lending bank sells the property off and realises the loan with interest, or the heir(s) of the owner repays the loan and gets the property back.

 Following the budget proposal, the NHB, which has been working on this product, came out with guidelines on reverse mortgage products by banks and housing finance companies. 

 Until now, only Punjab National Bank has launched this product and charges an interest rate of 10 per cent. 

 Under its scheme, PNB offers a loan of up to Rs 1 crore. 

 Under the new scheme, loans will be available to people older than 60 if they own a house with a clear title free of encumbrances, PNB chairman and managing director S.C. Gupta said.

 Allahabad Bank is the second in line with its reverse mortgage plan.

 However, Mahajan declined to comment on what could be the rate of interest in Allahabad Banks reverse mortgage scheme. 

 It is the banks board which will decide on the interest rate and I dont want to comment on that. However, it will be in line with what others offer, he said. 

 Not many banks are keen to offer reverse mortgage. 

 The chiefs of UCO Bank and Centurion Bank of Punjab said they would rather wait for others to launch their products first.

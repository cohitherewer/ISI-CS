 Porsche bid to up stake in VW

 Frankfurt, March 25 (Reuters): Porsche has taken advantage of a surge in Volkswagen (VW) stocks to meet a mandatory requirement to offer to buy out all remaining shares at a price few investors are likely to accept.

 Porsche, which controls 27.3 per cent of VWs voting rights and holds an option to buy a further 3.7 per cent, said it planned to boost its stake to up to 31 per cent soon a move that triggers a mandatory takeover bid under German law.

 Porsche is convinced that a closer bond with VW through an increase of the stake to more than 30 per cent of the VW ordinary shares will benefit both partners without diluting or endangering the identity of Porsche, it said in a statement.

 The sports car maker hopes that by offering investors the minimum amount required which is expected to value VW shares at a hefty 14 per cent discount to Fridays closing price it can cross the 30 per cent threshold on the cheap and never be forced to launch a bid again.

 We dont want a majority, a Porsche spokesman said.

 For ordinary shares, the offer is expected to be 100.92 euros per share, while for preferred shares no specific figure was given, with the amount to be determined by the German securities regulator, BaFin.

 Diageo craves for Absolut

 HIGH SPIRITS

 London, Sept.20 (Reuters): The UKs Diageo Plc is very interested in buying Swedens Absolut vodka which is valued at $6 billion. Diageo chief executive Paul Walsh said he could see solutions to any possible anti-trust problems that might arise because of the deal .

 We are very interested in Absolut and the feasibility will be linked to the level of interest, Walsh said. He added the potential of the vodka brand would only be known when financial details were released. 

 We can see solutions in all jurisdictions but the complexity will vary from market to market, he said of his interest in the worlds No. 2 vodka brand. Diageo owns the best-selling brand Smirnoff.

 Sweden plans to sell off Absoluts parent, the 90-year old state-owned Vin amp; Sprit. Four players keen on buying the company are Pernod Ricard, Fortune Brands, privately owned Bacardi and Diageo.

 Absolut is one of the biggest and fastest growing spirits brand in the world and is seen as the crown jewel of Swedens largest-ever push to privatise state assets. Around half of Absolut vodka is now sold in the US.

 Walsh added that Diageo had not yet seen full details on Vin amp; Sprit but he expected all likely buyers to be contacted in October by investment bank Morgan Stanley, which is in charge of organising the sale of the Swedish business.

 Walsh said Absolut was not a must have acquisition, but would be a good bolt-on deal, subject to seeing the financial data. He added that he had not visited Sweden in connection with the sale of Absolut. 

 Walsh would not comment on potential concerns from an Absolut deal by European and US regulators.

 However, analysts said Diageo might have more problems in Brussels than in Washington because of the different ways in which regulators look at anti-trust issues.

 The analysts said the US tended to look more at pricing and a bottle of $25 Absolut was seen in a different category than Smirnoff at $14, while European regulators looked at the whole market, whether it was for spirits or vodka.

 Diageo shares were up 0.8 per cent at 10.79.

 Bourses come under RTI 

 New Delhi, June 10 (PTI): The Central Information Commission (CIC) has brought the countrys stock exchanges under the purview of Right to Information Act.

 Disposing two different applications filed against two stock exchanges, the CIC directed all the bourses in the country to comply with the RTI rules in three months.

 It also directed the Jaipur Stock Exchange (JSE) and the National Stock Exchange, against which the applications were filed, to put in place an RTI regime in a month.

 The commission holds that a stock exchange being a quasi-governmental body working under the statute and exercising statutory powers has to be held a public authority within the meaning of the RTI Act, the bench said.

 The commission was hearing appeals of Raj Kumari Agrawal and K. Lall (both investors) who had moved against the JSE and the NSE for turning down their information request on grounds that the bourses were beyond the purview of the RTI Act.

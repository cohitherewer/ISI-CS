The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Pressure on debt funds set to mount

 GUEST COLUMN - Dhirendra Kumar

 Last year, I thought that Budget 2006 was a low-impact one as far as issues like savings and tax relief on savings were concerned. The basic shape of taxes, both personal and capital gains, remained the same. In Budget 2007, things are much the same. This is yet another low-impact budget whose underlying message for savings and investments is that things are basically allright and theres no need to tinker too much. As I thought last year too, theres nothing wrong with a budget thats basically a do-nothing in these areas. Historically, Indian finance ministers have shown a tendency to do too much of the wrong things when governments are in some political pressure but Chidambaram has stuck to his guns and basically emphasised that his policy on savings is just fine and I think thats a good thing. For individuals doing their tax-planning, stability of the tax regime has a great value.

 However, there are a few changes that will impact some segments. The increase in the basic tax exemption by Rs 10,000 means an extra Rs 1,000 a year for all tax payers. This kind of an increase should really be automatic and linked to some sort of an inflation index.

 Some of the mutual fund industrys debt fund products will come under increased pressure as the dividend distribution tax in liquid and money market funds has been hiked to 25 per cent. These are funds that most corporate houses use to park short-term cash. Of course, banks will benefit because their deposits will not be as relatively unattractive as they are now compared to income funds, but on the whole this will definitely mean a higher tax outgo (even though this tax outgo is invisible in their accounts) for cash-rich companies. Its difficult to calculate the exact impact at this stage but it is entirely possible that fund companies that have been hyperactive in these kinds of products could be severely affected.

 In his speech, the finance minister said the government sought to promote the flow of investment to the infrastructure sector by permitting mutual funds to launch and operate dedicated infrastructure funds Im not sure yet what this means. Funds are already free to launch any kind of sector-specific funds and some infrastructure funds already exist. Another point about funds he made is that the government would converge the different regulations that allow individuals and Indian mutual funds to invest in overseas securities by permitting individuals to invest through Indian mutual funds. Here again, individuals can already invest abroad through mutual funds. I guess things will become clearer when the actual regulations detailing these changes arrive.

 Another interesting statement is that the government will put in place an enabling mechanism to permit Indian companies to unlock a part of their holdings in group companies for meeting their financing requirements by issue of Exchangeable Bonds. 

 In countries where they are permitted, exchangeable bonds can be exchanged for the stock of a company other than the issuer, generally a subsidiary. I guess this would be mostly of interest to business houses that like to use innovative financing and restructuring strategies.

 State, Tatas team up for Jharkhand coal

 SAMBIT SAHA 

 Hunt for black diamond

 Calcutta, July 8: Tata Metaliks, a subsidiary of Tata Steel, has joined hands with the West Bengal Mineral Development and Trading Corporation to bid for two coal blocks in Jharkhand.

 The government body will supply coal to Tata Metaliks pig iron plant in Kharagpur.

 The two coal blocks in the West Bokaro district of Jharkhand is reserved under the state quota and will not be handed over to private companies. However, the Bengal governments outfit will face competition from other state agencies.

 The role of the Jharkhand government will be keenly watched on the issue. Earlier, it had turned down an iron ore mining lease to the Jindals for a plant in Bengal. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had even taken up the matter with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 

 This time, though, the two coal mines would have to be allocated to other states. 

 Jharkhand mine secretary Jayshankar Tewari said there was a lot of pressure on the state. We have six coal blocks and 300 applications pending. So you can imagine, he said. 

 Bengal has a good deposit of low-ash coal but a rise in demand is forcing the government agency to look outside the state. Earlier, it had agreed to provide coking coal to JSW Steel for its proposed steel plant at Salboni. 

 It would also have to provide some deposits to Bhushan Steel which has plans for another plant near Asansol. 

 City-based Tata Metaliks is an early bird investor in the state. It now wants access to coal and iron ore blocks to cut raw material costs. 

 However, it will be difficult for it to get blocks in neighbouring states for a plant in Bengal . 

 The West Bengal Mineral Development and Trading Corporation has, thus, come forward to bail out Tata Metaliks. 

 Apart from Jharkhand, the Tata Steel subsidiary is also exploring states such as Maharashtra , Orissa and Chhattisgarh.

 In Orissa, it hopes to benefit from Tata Steels 6mt plant for which the parent company will get a mining lease soon. Tata Metaliks has withdrawn its application in the state hoping that Orissa will allow Tata Steel to send ore to Kharagpur. 

 In Maharashtra , the company applied for around 11 iron ore blocks in the Sindhudurg district. The company has bought a plant in the state and hopes to get mining rights soon.

 In the last fiscal, Tata Metaliks, the largest pig iron manufacturer in the country, witnessed pressure on its margins because product prices came down while cost of coking coal and iron ore increased. As a result, the backward integration exercise will help in the long run.

 The plant in Maharashtra depends on iron ore from market. 

 The iron ore cost may come down to less than Rs 500 a tonne in case it gets the mine compared with open market prices of Rs 1,800-2,000. 

 Earlier, Tata Metaliks decided to go ahead with one of its value-addition projects. It is the manufacture of ductile iron pipes in Kharagpur.

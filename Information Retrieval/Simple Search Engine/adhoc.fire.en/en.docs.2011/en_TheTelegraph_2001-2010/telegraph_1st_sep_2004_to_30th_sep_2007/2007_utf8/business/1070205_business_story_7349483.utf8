 Emirates NRIs face ICICI demat bar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Tough Stand

 Mumbai, Feb. 4: The ICICI group has frozen demat accounts of Indians living in the UAE who had failed to furnish personal details demanded by the bank.

 ICICI Bank had asked for the documents after the 2005 Mumbai flood damaged the original ones. 

 This included papers submitted for opening savings and current accounts, demat accounts for trading and investing and ICICI Direct online trading accounts.

 Apart from the NRIs, the floods had also affected several resident account holders. The bank had given its customers a deadline of December 25, 2006 to submit the required documents, while January 31, 2007 was the last date for the UAE customers.

 Many customers, who could not meet these deadlines, had their accounts frozen. The group will reactivate the accounts if the documents are submitted. 

 However, the exact number of accounts that have been frozen could not be ascertained. 

 Some of the account holders said they were given little time to comply with the submission of the documents. However, sources at the ICICI group denied this. They said while the group took all efforts to rescue the documents after the deluge, the accounts would be activated again if they are resubmitted. 

 An ICICI Bank official said only some of the demat accounts have been closed down temporarily. 

 We have not frozen other accounts such as savings bank, he said. 

 ICICI Direct offers services including online trading of shares and mutual funds.

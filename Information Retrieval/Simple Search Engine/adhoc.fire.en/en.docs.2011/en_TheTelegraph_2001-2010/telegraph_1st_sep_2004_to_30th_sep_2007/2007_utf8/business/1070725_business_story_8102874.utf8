 Spectrum divide gets wider

 JAYATI GHOSE

 Different tones

 New Delhi, July 24: The telecom industry is divided on the issue of fresh spectrum for 2G and 3G services. Bharti feels existing operators within a circle should be offered spectrum before others, while Vodafone Essar and Idea want a parity between licence holders, whether they are existing players or are yet to start operations.

 It is obvious that a player already operating in a circle should get first preference over a new operator, said a senior Bharti Airtel official. 

 Only after 15MHz of spectrum has been reserved for existing operators, should the government entertain any request from those who have a licence without spectrum or those who have applied for but have no licence, the official said. Bharti holds licences in all 23 telecom circles.

 According to Vodafone, which operates in 16 circles and has licence applications pending in the rest, Bhartis position is unreasonable. We are licence holders. If we have not been allocated spectrum for operations, we cannot be penalised for it, said a senior Vodafone official. 

 Idea, Aircel and Spice also support Vodafones stand. 

 Idea operates in 11 circles. It has two licences for Mumbai and Bihar. However, it is awaiting spectrum allocation before starting operations in these two circles. Idea has nine pending licence applications. 

 Idea officials said licences already qualified a company for spectrum. It is bundled with the licence and the fee represents part payment for spectrum. So how can licence holders be asked to participate in an auction.

 On the reservation of spectrum for pan-India operators as suggested by Bharti, Vodafone Essar gives the example of the C telecom circles in the country where only 30Mhz of spectrum is available per circle. Vodafone said, Even if additional 20Mhz is made available, itll lead to a total of 50Mhz for GSM operators. 

 Now if four existing GSM operators demand up to 15 Mhz, this 50 Mhz will be inadequate for them and, therefore, the licencee whos legitimately waiting in the queue for his initial allotment will never get the spectrum allocation despite having paid the entry fee, said Vodafone officials.

 Paswan to lead mine mission to Australia

 Paswan: Fresh hunt

 New Delhi, June 21: Steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan is planning to go to Australia this weekend to ensure the supply of minerals to India.

 He will head a delegation comprising top bosses of steel and mining PSUs, which will explore opportunities in minerals such as iron ore and coal. The delegation is expected to finalise some tie-ups as well. 

 Steel ministry sources said the move followed a push from the Prime Ministers Office for global tieups by Indian companies for scarce inputs, especially energy resources. 

 Indian companies are hunting for mines in Australia, South East Asia, East Europe and even Canada. 

 The Steel Authority of India Limited was almost on the verge of acquiring coal mines in Australia and Indonesia. SAIL buys most of its top grade coking coal from Australia through long-term contracts. 

 Often the Australian firms invoke force majeure clauses to restrict supply. Force majeure is a common clause in contracts that relieves parties from obligations under extraordinary circumstances.

 Such situations have prompted SAIL to buy strategic minority stakes in coal mines abroad. 

 The government is also encouraging state-run steel and mining companies to jointly bid for controlling stakes in mining firms abroad. 

 The steel ministry has already circulated a draft cabinet note for a special purpose vehicle to acquire coal and iron ore mines and limestone quarries abroad. 

 Initial stakeholders of the SPV will be SAIL, the Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited and the National Mineral Development Corporation.

 SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta will be part of the team to Australia.

 The invitation to Paswan has been extended by Australias federal minister for industries, Ian McFarlane. 

 Our focus will be western Australia which is resource rich, top officials said. Australia meets the coking coal requirements for 50 per cent of the steel produced in India, with the value of imports estimated at $1.2 billion. 

 Indian companies have also bought two copper mines and three coal mines in Australia over the past year. 

 According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural amp; Resource Economics, investments worth Australian $84 billion are under consideration in the steel and energy sectors.

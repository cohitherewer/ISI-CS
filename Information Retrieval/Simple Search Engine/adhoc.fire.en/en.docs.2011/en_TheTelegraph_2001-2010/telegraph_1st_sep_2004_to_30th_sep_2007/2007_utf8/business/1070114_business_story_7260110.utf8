The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Global goal for PNB

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 13: The Punjab National Bank (PNB) will form a special committee to help expand its overseas operations.

 The committee, which will be in place by March this year, will put forward a game plan by April 30. 

 The bank is set to start overseas operations of its subsidiary in London, Ottawa, Canada, and an offshore banking unit in Singapore by June 30.

 In the next two to three years, we will make more inroads in our international business. As our clients remain bullish and go for more acquisitions abroad, overseas branches will help us fund and service them better, said S.C. Gupta, chairman and managing director of PNB. 

 The bank will file an application announcing its plans with the office of the superintendent of financial institutions in Ottawa, Canada within January 31. 

 It has also approached the financial services authority in the UK to upgrade its representative office in London into a wholly owned subsidiary. RBI has already cleared the proposals.

 An application has also been filed with MAS Singapore for an offshore banking unit and with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to set up a branch in Hong Kong.

 Gupta pointed out that PNB would take a view on stake dilution only after March 31, keeping in mind the development of the money market but before that there were no possibility of a strategic investor or a merger with the parent bank.

 We had already raised Rs 2,000 crore with the capital adequacy ratio being at 12.71 per cent. We had raised Rs 500 crore again after that, but will evaluate whether further raising of capital is required after February. The bank had a gross NPA of 5.96 per cent in March 2005, which has become 4.1 per cent now. The target is 3.5 per cent by March 2007.

 As on December 2006, the total business of the bank stood at Rs 219,000 crore and Gupta pointed out that PNB will surpass the target of Rs 2.25 lakh crore by March 31, 2007 to Rs 2.28 lakh crore.

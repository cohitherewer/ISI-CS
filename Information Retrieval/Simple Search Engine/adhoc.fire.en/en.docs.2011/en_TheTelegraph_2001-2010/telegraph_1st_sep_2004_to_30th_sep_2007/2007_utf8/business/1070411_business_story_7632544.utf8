 We plan to roll out a dozen Notting Hill stores, which will be 1000 sq ft each, across the country. All the stores will be owned and managed by the company. Two of them will be opened in Calcutta. Each store will attract an investment of around Rs 50 lakh, said Shreyas Joshi, president of Raymond Apparel.

 We are yet to decide on the number of stores to be opened per brand and their locations. However, the investment in this venture will be an additional Rs 30 crore, he added.

 The companys brands are Park Avenue, Manzoni, ColorPlus, Parx and the recently launched kids lifestyle brand Zapp. The Notting Hill range will also cover accessories.

 Of the Rs 88,340-crore apparel market, menswear has a 37 per cent share at Rs 32,590 crore, kids segment 15 per cent at Rs 13,085 crore, and womens apparel 32 per cent at Rs 28,375 crore.

 Foreign deal values high, says survey

 New Delhi, June 3 (PTI): Corporate India is all game for its global merger and acquisition spree, despite a majority of the top managers believing they are paying much more than the true value of the target companies.

 This was revealed in a survey by global research and analysis firm Evalueserve on the recent mergers and acquisitions by domestic companies.

 There is a near-consensus among industry players and analysts that aggressive buyouts are necessary for growth and geographic expansion.

 However, 56 per cent of the respondents felt these deals were overvalued, 22 per cent said the companies were not overpaying, while 22 per cent said they were not sure.

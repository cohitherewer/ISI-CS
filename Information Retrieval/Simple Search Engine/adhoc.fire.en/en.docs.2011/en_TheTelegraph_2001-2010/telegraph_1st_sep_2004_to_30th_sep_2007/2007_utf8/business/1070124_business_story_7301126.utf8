 Success story

 Mumbai, Jan. 23: Grasim, the flagship company of the Aditya Birla group, has reported a 184 per cent surge in net profit in the third quarter at Rs 555 crore against Rs 195 crore in the year-ago period. 

 Increased capacity utilisation, strengthening of operational efficiencies and enriched product mix were the major drivers of success. 

 The realisations in the cement and viscose staple fibre businesses have improved significantly. Grasims consolidated revenues soared by 46 per cent to Rs 3,688 crore from Rs 2,520 crore a year ago. A substantially higher provision for tax expenses, which rose 221 per cent to Rs.308 crore from Rs 96 crore, did not crimp profit growth.

 The results were also impressive on a standalone basis. While revenues were up 37 per cent to Rs 2,279 crore from Rs 1,660 crore, net profit was Rs 412 crore compared with Rs 162 crore a year ago, a growth of 154 per cent. The VSF business has improved its performance on all operating parameters.

 The companys VSF capacity at Nagda, Harihar and Kharach will stand augmented by 49,275 tonnes to 315,725 tonnes per annum by 2008 upon completion of expansion and modernisation at a total capital outlay of Rs 721 crore. 

 The cement segments performance has been excellent, propelled by strong growth in demand and realisations. Capacity utilisation was higher at 112 per cent against 106 per cent a year ago. Revenues increased 55 per cent, led by strong realisations. The share of blended cement increased from 49 per cent to 61 per cent. 

 Higher dispatches through rail (from 37 per cent to 46 per cent) helped partially mitigate the escalating freight costs. The white cement business also fared well. Production was higher by 5 per cent at 91,722 tonnes. 

 Volumes were up 3 per cent at 93,571 tonnes. Realisations increased by 6 per cent to Rs.6,456 per tonne.

 Sundram in buy mode

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 7: Chennai-based Sundram Fasteners Ltd (SFL) is planning to buy an auto component maker in North America.

 The company has short-listed some targets in Detroit, Michigan, where it has a sales and warehouse facility, Sundram president Sampathkumar Moorthy said today on the sidelines of the 34th national convention of AIMA and AAMO here.

 We dont have a manufacturing facility in North America. We have a unit in Germany and one in the UK that cater to the European markets. We also have a facility in China, which serves South Asian markets, Moorthy said. 

 Sundram Fasteners is aiming at technological improvement by acquiring a company in Detroit, the North American auto industry hub. We plan to buy a company that makes powder metal parts, pumps and assemblies for vehicles. The acquisition will be valued at between $70 million and $80 million. We had acquired our German unit for 50 million euros, Moorthy added.

 The buyout will be funded through borrowings from banks and financial institutions, he said. 

 Sundram Fasteners reported gross sales of Rs 337.55 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 compared with Rs 324.1 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

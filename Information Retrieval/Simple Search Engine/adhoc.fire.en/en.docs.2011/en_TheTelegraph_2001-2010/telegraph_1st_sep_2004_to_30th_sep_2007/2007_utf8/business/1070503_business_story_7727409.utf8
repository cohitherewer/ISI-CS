 News Corp eyes Dow Jones

 Murdoch: Showing interest

 New York, May 2 (Reuters): News Corp is planning to buy Dow Jones amp; Co, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, for about $5 billion a deal that will make Rupert Murdoch a major player in global financial news.

 Dow Jones said its board and trustees of the controlling Bancroft family are evaluating the unsolicited $60-a-share bid, a 65 per cent premium to its closing price on Monday. News Corp called the proposal a friendly offer. The deal places Dow Joness enterprise value its market value plus debt minus cash at a lofty 15 times of the estimated 2007 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, well ahead of the newspaper groups average eight to 10 times valuation, Benchmark Co analyst Ed Atorino said.

 The news pushed up Dow Jones shares by more than 50 per cent and sparked a rally in other publishers and financial newswires. News Corp shares fell more than 4 per cent as analysts said more exposure to the slow-growing newspaper industry would weigh on company financials.

 The strategic rationale, which, while dilutive, solidifies a new growth driver for News Corp, Richard Greenfield, analyst at Pali Capital said. It will create a multi-platform business news giant spanning online, print and television.

 Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Michael Nathanson said the financial cost to News Corp would not be overly severe, and could dilute 2008 earnings by 1.6 per cent to 6.2 per cent, excluding any cost cuts.

 Knockout punch

 Murdochs move turns up the heat in a newspaper market that has been in the crosshairs of dealmakers. Dow Jones belongs to a class of family-controlled papers that have so far rebuffed shareholder efforts to reconsider their ownership structure even as other publishers, including Tribune Co and Knight Ridder, have gone private or sold key assets.

 For Dow Jones, the big price premium offered by News Corp amounts to a knockout punch, one Dow Jones investor said.

 It will be hard for the Bancroft family to say no even though legally they have the option of doing so, First Eagle Global Funds Jean-Marie Eveillard said. I think investors who own the shares will be almost unanimous in saying this is a price they cannot refuse, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Dream goes bust in boom time

 Manas Chakravarty

 P. Chidambaram does not dare to dream big these days. He had everything going for him a booming economy, buoyant revenues and great respect for the India story among investors. This was the time, as the governments own economic survey put it, to gather escape velocity to put the economy in a different orbit. Far from doing that, Chidambaram has unveiled a plodding, pedestrian budget, tailor-made for the elections.

 Being conservative, however, has its merits. The finance ministers projections for tax revenues, for instance, are conservative and prudent. Net tax revenues for the current year are 28 per cent higher than the actuals for 2005-06. Yet Chidambaram has budgeted for a 16.7 per cent rise for the next fiscal. That should be easily achievable.

 THE WINNERS 

 Munnabhai: Gandhi ashrams get cash 

 Buladi: More money to fight AIDS

 Pets: Imported food becomes cheaper 

 Mouth freshener: Cheaper because of duty cut

 AND THE LOSERS

 Private jets:High-fliers like Vijay 

 Mallya will have to pay more to import aircraft

 Pan Masala: Those with tobacco lose 

 tax exemption

It is on the expenditure side Chidambaram may be indulging in fantasy. This year, revenue expenditure overshot the budget estimates comfortably and the rise in revenue expenditure over the actuals for 2005-06 is 15.2 per cent. But in 2007-08, the finance minister expects this increase to be limited to just 10 per cent. With elections looming ahead, that is a forlorn hope.

 An obvious thing the government needs to do is improve infrastructure. Better infrastructure holds the key to higher productivity in manufacturing, which is indispensable for sustaining the pace of growth. Yet Chidambaram has been surprisingly timid in capital expenditure. This year, total capital expenditure is higher than the 2005-06 actuals by 12.8 per cent, well below the rate of growth of nominal GDP. 

 Next year, the finance minister has budgeted for an increase of 10.3 per cent in capital expenditure, hardly the pace at which we can catch up with China. Of course, theres the promise of infrastructure spending against the RBIs foreign exchange reserves, which will be excellent if it is finally implemented. 

 The central plan outlay is up 31 per cent. But the bulk of the increase is on account of social services, which are budgeted to go up by 35.8 per cent. In agriculture and allied services, the quantum of increase is 15.8 per cent, which isnt bad but not enough to arrest decades of neglect. 

 The rural development budget has been increased by 11.4 per cent, while the outlay for irrigation and flood control is up by a mere 9.7 per cent. 

 In last years budget, the outlay for agriculture and allied activities was increased by 25.2 per cent, while the budget for irrigation was higher by 40 per cent. The revised estimate for the current year shows the government has missed its spending targets for both agriculture and irrigation. Of course, it has also hiked the bank lending targets for agriculture, which might make up for the shortfall.

 A similar lack of urgency is seen in the outlay for energy, which is up 15 per cent. Last year, the budgeted increase in outlay on energy was 29.5 per cent. That target, too, wasnt reached.

 In short, the finance minister has depended upon modest targets for capital expenditure combined with buoyancy in tax receipts to prune the fiscal deficit. Also, while nobody expected any reforms because of the elections and because of Left opposition, the fact remains that reforms are essential to boost productivity.

 What about inflation? The government has reduced customs duties and excise duties on some items to attack inflation, but its unlikely to be enough. Data shows that the rise in the prices of food articles and basic metals and products is responsible for about half of the total inflation and there is little anybody can do about that in the short term.

 The RBI will, therefore, continue to use monetary policy to stamp out inflation, as deputy governor Rakesh Mohan has indicated. The government knows well enough that rising prices can lose elections while voters have so far shown scant regard for higher growth. Bond yields ended up higher on Wednesday despite the low level of government borrowing projected in the budget, on precisely these concerns. 

 The action in the stock market was overshadowed by the global meltdown. But even if global markets rebound, the question that needs to be asked is: with the RBI tightening monetary policy and with the finance ministry tightening the fiscal deficit, can the market continue to fight government policy aimed at slowing the economy? 

 The third quarter GDP growth of 8.6 per cent, the lowest in four quarters, shows the RBIs measures are already taking effect.

 Calcutta, May 4: JP Morgan Special Situations (Mauritius) Ltd is set to make a killing on its investments in Binani Cement.

 The cement firm will tap the market with a public issue of 2.05 crore shares. The entire equity offering, comprising 10.09 per cent of its post-issue paid-up capital, is from the stake of JP Morgan Special Situations.

 At a price band of Rs 75-85, the private equity investment arm of the US-based JP Morgan is expected to mop up Rs 170 crore at the upper limit.

 JP Morgan Special Situations picked up a 25 per cent stake in Binani Cement in 2005 for Rs 120 crore. At Rs 85 a share, its total stakeholding in the cement company works out at Rs 375 crore. After the issue, its stake will be reduced to 14.91 per cent.

 Credit Suisse, another private equity investor, picked up 10 per cent in Binani Cement last August for Rs 73 a share. However, Credit Suisse is not selling any of its shares. Promoter group Binani Industries holds the remaining 65 per cent stake.

 Last year, Binani Industries wanted to sell a part of its stake through a public issue. But following the stock market meltdown in May, the company withdrew its draft prospectus and resubmitted it with JP Morgan willing to sell a part of its stake in the company.

 Binani Cement, which recently invested Rs 575 crore to expand its cement manufacturing and clinker capacities to 5.3 mt and 2.3 mt, respectively, is planning to set up greenfield plants in coastal Gujarat and in Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.

 The group is also scouting for private equity partners for Binani Zinc, a 90 per cent-owned subsidiary. Talks are on and we expect to finalise deals in a month, said D. Sundararajan, executive director of Binani Industries. Binani Zinc, with a production capacity of 38,000 tonnes per annum, has recently got alumina mining lease for two blocks in Rajasthan and Gujarat. The total reserves of these blocks are 1.3 mt. In other words, we will be able to lift 100,000 tonnes of concentrate per annum, Sundararajan said.

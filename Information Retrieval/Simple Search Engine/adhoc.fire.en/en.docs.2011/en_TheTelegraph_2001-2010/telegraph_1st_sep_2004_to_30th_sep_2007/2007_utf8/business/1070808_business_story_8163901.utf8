 New Delhi, Aug. 7: DuPont is setting up a manufacturing facility at Baddi in Himachal Pradesh. This plant will manufacture animal and human healthcare solutions.

 The company expects to earn revenues worth Rs 50 crore from this business in the next two to three years. DuPont India president and CEO Balvinder S. Kalsi said, The plant will start production from August-end. 

 The initiative makes sense in the wake of the spread of an epidemic like the avian flu. The company will manufacture a range of bio-security chemicals, including cleaners, disinfectants and sanitisers at the plant to prevent such diseases from mutating to humans, DuPont animal health solutions regional marketing manager (Asia Pacific) Dipal Parikh said. 

 The plant will meet the requirements at home and abroad. DuPont earlier imported products from its UK plant.

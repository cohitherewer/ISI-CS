 CII forecasts fall in growth

 Slowing down

 New Delhi, July 15 (PTI): The economy is expected to show a marginal decline in GDP growth at 9.2 per cent in the current fiscal against 9.4 per cent in 2006-07 with the services sector and industry maintaining the momentum, the CII has said.

 According to the chamber, the agriculture sector will clock a moderate 3 per cent growth against 2.7 per cent in 2006-07. Industry and the services sector are expected to grow at 9.4 per cent and 11.2 per cent respectively during 2007-08.

 The economy had registered a 9.4 per cent growth in 2006-07, the highest in the last 18 years, because of a good performance by manufacturing and services.

 In its quarterly analysis of the economy for January-March, the chamber said in spite of the appreciating rupee having an impact on exports, the countrys GDP grew at 9.1 per cent, led by a 19.35 per cent growth in corporate earnings. It said the rising rupee had a negative impact on textile and leather sectors during the fourth quarter.

 The profit margin is expected to erode further to 10.4 per cent during the next six months.

 The service sector companies registered a 45.68 per cent growth in profits compared with 10.32 per cent in the corresponding quarter last fiscal. The manufacturing sector, however, reported a slowdown in profits during the quarter to 7.91 per cent from 15.17 per cent in 2005-06.

 The chamber, however, cautioned that the continuous decline in oilseed production could be a hurdle to agricultural growth.

 Oilseed production has declined 14.79 per cent in the quarter under review. This is expected to increase the demand-supply gap for edible oils.

 The CII also stressed on the need to restructure domestic pricing policy of various crops as farmers are switching from oilseeds to lucrative alternatives such as wheat and gram.

 Calcutta, July 19: Dunlop promoter Pawan K. Ruia plans to raise overseas funds through DIL Rim amp; Wheels Corporation (DRW), the Mauritius-based holding company.

 Dunlop needs Rs 200 crore as working capital and another Rs 125 crore to meet old dues to start production at Sahagunj in Bengal and Ambattur in Tamil Nadu.

 The ailing tyre maker that Ruia bought in 2005 has failed to raise resources through share sale or foreign loans since it is under the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR).

 There is also a restriction on using the money raised through the external commercial borrowings (ECB) route as working capital.

 Therefore, Ruia has drawn up an innovative financing package whereby the holding company could raise funds for the subsidiary.

 There are two options. We come out of the BIFR or raise money via DRW, Ruia said after the 80th annual general meeting of Dunlop.

 The BIFR status gives the company protection from creditors in case of a default in loan repayment. As a result, financial institutions are usually cagey in lending to a BIFR company. Given Dunlops long history of litigation and labour unrest, domestic financial institutions are even more unwilling to give loans.

 Ruia had earlier proposed to sell a 15 per cent stake to foreign players and then raise loans from them through ECBs. But the Reserve Bank of India shot down the idea of using ECB money as working capital. If DRW raises the money, Ruia has to create a financial structure that provides security to the lender even if Dunlop remains under the BIFR.

 However, Ruia said he was confident that Dunlop would come out of the BIFR as its net worth had turned positive after selling real estate to wholly owned subsidiaries of the company and booking a profit on the balance sheet.

 We have applied to the BIFR and hope it will respond favourably. Even if it does not, there are ways to still raise money through DRW, he said.

 Ruia said the units at Sahagunj and Ambattur would start producing 50 tonnes a day each from August. So far Dunlop has inducted 929 of the 1,179 workers it had promised to take back. The payments under the early retirement scheme are also being made in tranches. 

 However, Dunlops rights issue has run into rough weather due to an AAIFR ruling. The company cannot issue fresh stock to shareholders or refund money. The company has appealed against it.

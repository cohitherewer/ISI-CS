 Calcutta, Jan. 19: Food processing needs a rationalised value-added tax (VAT) between zero and 4 per cent to become a Rs 1-lakh-crore industry in the next five years, Subodh Kant Sahai, Union minister for food processing, said.

 Around Rs 50,000 crore worth of fruits and vegetables are wasted due to lack of processing.

 We have succeeded in bringing down the customs and excise duty from 40 per cent to 10 per cent. However, VAT rates ranging from 4 per cent to 12.5 per cent on different commodities in different states defeat the whole purpose, said Sahai. Kerala levies a cumulative tax of 20 per cent on milk and fruit juices. Retailers have been demanding uniformity in VAT on various commodities across different states.

 The minister recommended nil tax on perishable items and a maximum of 4 per cent depending on the nature of the commodity.

 Sahai will meet Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on taxation issues and request state finance minister Ashim Dasgupta, who is heading the VAT empowered committee, to help sort out the taxation issue in different states.

 Many states have also levied a 12.5 per cent VAT on potato processing. In such a scenario, the efforts to process and market potato in states like Bengal would be in vain because of the huge difference in tax rates in different states, Sahai said.

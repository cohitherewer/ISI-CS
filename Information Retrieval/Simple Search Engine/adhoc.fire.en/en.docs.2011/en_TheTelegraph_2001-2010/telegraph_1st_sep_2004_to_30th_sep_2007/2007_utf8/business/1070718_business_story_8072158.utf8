 Tata Tea net profit dips

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, July 17: Tata Tea Ltd has posted a consolidated profit after tax of Rs 45.68 crore for the first quarter ended June 30 compared with Rs 80.07 crore in the year-ago period. 

 The drop in profit was attributed to higher advertising and promotional expenditure and the impact of interest on acquisitions, which was at Rs 65.61 crore. 

 Standalone net profit for the quarter also dipped 3.5 per cent to Rs 43 crore from Rs 44.56 crore.

 Standalone interest on loans for the first quarter amounted to Rs 10.89 crore.

 Income from standalone operations was Rs 290.01 crore for the quarter, a 14 per cent increase over the corresponding period of the previous fiscal. 

 The growth was driven by an 18 per cent rise in branded tea volumes.

 During the quarter, the outstanding 2,810,000 warrants issued to Tata Sons Ltd were converted to equity shares at a price of Rs 726.45 per share. 

 The proceeds from the issue of shares have been used to finance subsidiary Tetley Groups investments in Energy Brands Inc. 

 Earnings per share have come down to Rs 7.06 from Rs 7.93 for the quarter (non annualised).

 The companys consolidated world wide revenues for the quarter was Rs 1,018.84 crore.

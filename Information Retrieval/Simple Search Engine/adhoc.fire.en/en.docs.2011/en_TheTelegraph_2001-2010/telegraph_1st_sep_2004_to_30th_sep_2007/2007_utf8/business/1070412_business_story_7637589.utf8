 India to gain in Citi job rejig

 New York, April 11 (PTI): Citigroup Inc today said it would cut 17,000 jobs, which is nearly 5 per cent of its global workforce. The company plans to move 9,500 positions to India and other low-cost locations.

 Aiming to cut down its annual expenses by $4.6 billion in the next three years, the US-based banking major said its restructuring plans included closing offices and relocating employees.

 While announcing the job cuts, Citigroup said its total headcount would continue to grow in 2007, but the rate of growth, excluding acquisitions, new branches and other investments, would slow significantly.

 The company could move a large chunk of the jobs to India, especially for equity research, investment banking and back-office transaction-related activities, sources close to the development said.

 The total number of jobs to be eliminated is more than half of the positions Citigroup added to its workforce in 2006.

 More than 9,500 jobs will be moved to lower-cost locations, both domestically and internationally, the company said.

 Ultimately these changes will streamline Citi and make us leaner, more efficient, and better able to take advantage of high revenue opportunities, Citigroup chairman and CEO Charles Prince said.

 Industry observers said the job cuts were aimed more at achieving an optimal level of performance rather than plain cost savings as the company was also aggressively going ahead with acquisition plans. 

 Earlier this week, the company agreed to buy Taiwans Bank of Overseas Chinese for about $426 million, while it is also in talks to acquire Japans third-largest brokerage firm Nikko Cordial Corp for more than $13 billion.

 Moreover, it is reported to be in discussions to buy New York-based hedge fund Old Lane to bring in Vikram Pandit as the head of its alternative-investments group, which includes private equity and real estate businesses.

 The company is aiming to achieve savings worth $2.1 billion this year from the proposed restructuring initiatives, for which it will assume a pre-tax charge of $1.38 billion in the first quarter of 2007.

 Labour row engulfs Chiria

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Aug. 7: Steel Authority of Indias problems with Chiria have been compounded by a strike at Asias largest iron ore mine.

 Already, the steel PSU and the Jharkhand government are involved in a bitter tussle over the mining rights of Chiria.

 To add to the woes, no ore is moving out of SAILs Gua mines, an extension of the Chiria area, since the beginning of the month because of the strike by labourers hired through a contractor. 

 Led by Rajesh Koda, the brother of Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda, the strike threatens to spread across all the companys mines in and around Chiria.

 The strike has the potential to cripple production at Bokaro Steel Plant, the largest steel mill in the state. The gravity of the situation has now prompted Union steel secretary R.S. Pandey, SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta and Madhu Koda to get involved in talks.

 Top steel ministry officials said discussions were held yesterday and were continuing even today. Hopefully we may have a solution soon. It can even be by tomorrow.

 Roongta had earlier promised the Jharkhand government that once the state cleared its expansion plans, he would not only absorb all labourers working through contractors but also hire in large numbers. 

 The officials said steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan was keeping aloof as he felt his involvement would merely lend credence to Rajesh Koda who was trying to gain political mileage by wresting concessions from SAIL. 

 The labour war by Koda junior against SAIL is causing a grave embarrassment to his elder brother, Madhu. 

 The chief minister, on the one hand, is trying to take away a large chunk of Chiria from SAIL and give some of the ore to its rivals. At the same time, he is negotiating fresh investments worth tens of thousands of crores from the steel PSU to expand its capacity in the state by 22 million tonnes.

 The officials said the elder Koda wanted the strike to end as soon as possible and had given a signal to this effect to his brother.

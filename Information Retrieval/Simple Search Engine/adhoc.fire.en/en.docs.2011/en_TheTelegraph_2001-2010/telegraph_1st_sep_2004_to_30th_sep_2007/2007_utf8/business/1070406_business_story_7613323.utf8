 Starwood plans 15 Aloft hotels in India

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai/New Delhi, April 5: The Starwood group, owner of the Le Meridien, Sheraton and Westin brands, plans to roll out 15 Aloft hotels in the next three to five years.

 Starwood estimates investments of $192 million at $80,000 per room in Aloft. This excludes the cost of acquiring land for the hotels. 

 In 3-5 years, we want to start construction of all 15 hotels of our new brand Aloft Each Aloft will have 130-160 rooms, Starwood senior vice-president Thomas J. Monahan said.

 The Aloft hotels will have real estate developers as partners. Monahan said the strategy for Aloft, including investment commitments, would depend on the outcome of the negotiations with the developers.

 The plans are for Aloft hotels in Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Bangalore and Hyderabad. 

 Monahan said the company preferred the new town areas of the city, IT parks and office campuses to hotels in the heart of the city.

 Starwood will also launch the Westin brand, though officials were mum on the locations. 

 In the upcoming Westin, we will provide only management, Monahan said.

 InterContinental

 UK-based InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) today signed contracts to manage six more hotels, taking the number of hotels it manages in the country to 20.

 Three of the six hotels will be Crowne Plazas in Kochi, Hyderabad and New Delhi; two Holiday Inns in Pune and Kochi; and an InterContinental in Pune.

 Declining to divulge the value of the deals, the company said it had signed up with real estate developers Poonawala Group, KGA Group, Vascon Engineers and Indroyal Group. Expanding our already significant employee base and operations in India underpins our long-term commitment towards the country, said Tony South, senior vice-president (development and asset management), Asia Pacific, IHG.

 Calcutta, Jan. 27: UTI Bank is set to float its own asset management company (AMC) by June this year. The firm will be called UBL Asset Management Company. 

 We recently got the Reserve Bank of Indias approval to float the AMC, said R. Ashok Kumar, executive director (corporate strategy), UTI Bank. 

 The chief executive officer of the AMC is also being finalised, he added. Kumar, however, refused to give away the name of the person selected as the CEO.

 The bank has also applied for registration with the Securities and Exchange Board of India. After the RBIs nod, the bank expects to get the market regulators approval soon. The company is expected to start operations from the first quarter of the next financial year, Kumar said.

 UTI Banks move to float an AMC may not be good news for UTI Mutual Fund.

 On being asked whether the functioning of UBL Asset Management will be in direct conflict of interest with UTI Mutual Fund, Kumar said the AMC would focus on the infrastructure sector only. The company has UBL in its name instead of UTI Bank to avoid any confusion with UTI Mutual Fund. 

 However, UTI Bank has a peculiar problem to deal with. When, in 2003, the Unit Trust of India was split into UTI Mutual Fund and UTI Specified Undertakings of the Unit Trust of India (UTI-I) governed by the government, the latter was made the holding company of the trusts all non-mutual fund initiatives, including UTI Bank, with the provision that UTI-I would be wound up in a time-bound manner. Under the holding of UTI-I, the bank was allowed to retain the word UTI in its name till UTI-I withdraws from the bank by selling its stake. 

 As things stand now, the deadline for UTI-I to divest its entire stake (27.47 per cent) in UTI Bank is March 2008, Kumar said. However, it is the government which will decided whether the deadline would be extended or not, he added.

 With the March 2008 deadline nearing, the UTI Bank management is also contemplating whether to rechristen itself or get a copyright of the UTI name after getting it trademarked.

 Meanwhile, the bank is branching out to high networth customers by setting up priority banking branches in major cities. 

 We opened a priority banking branch in Mumbai last week and today we have set up one in Calcutta. Three more such branches will be opened before March this year and seven more by the end of the current calendar year, said Kumar.

 A priority banking customer would be required to maintain a minimum average quarterly balance of Rs 5 lakh. This is another way for the bank to mobilise more low-cost deposits, Kumar agreed.

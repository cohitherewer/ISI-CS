 Crude shock to fuel price cut hope

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Costly deal

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: The price of the Indian basket of crude oil has risen to $56.02 per barrel in the first week of February from $52.53 per barrel the national oil companies paid in January, the latest official data stated. 

 Cuts in domestic petrol and diesel prices are unlikely, as the downstream oil companies will come under increased financial pressure again. 

 While the price of the Indian basket had hit a low of $49.85 per barrel on January 17, it had surged past the $52 mark in the latter half of the month. Petroleum minister Murli Deora had said the government would reduce petrol and diesel prices if the price of the crude stabilised at $50 per barrel. However, this does not appear to be happening. 

 International crude prices have shot up again with the oil exporting countries cutting production and the demand for heating oil increasing due to a bitter chill sweeping the US after an unexpectedly mild winter in January.

 The Nigerian oil workers threat to go on strike due to an increase in the number of kidnappings and attacks on oil companies across the southern Niger delta area, where most of the countrys crude is produced, is also reported to have been a contributory factor. A senior Indian Oil official said speculators aggravate the situation under such uncertain conditions by building stocks.

 India imports substantial quantities of high quality sweet crude from Nigeria and the trouble in the country has affected both prices and sourcing of crude for the national oil companies. 

 The Indian basket of crude imports comprises 60 per cent of the relatively cheap Gulf crude and 40 per cent of high-quality sweet crude such as the Brent and Bonny Light from Nigeria. The crudes are mixed to reduce production cost. India imports over 70 per cent of its crude requirements and any increase in international prices hits the refining companies. 

 The public sector oil companies are still incurring a loss of 26 paise per litre on diesel sales and making a profit of a mere Rs 1.89 per litre on petrol, said Indian Oil chairman Sarthak Behuria. This does not leave any scope to reduce prices.

 The oil companies are also losing money on sales of cooking gas to households and kerosene supplies through the public distribution system. The downstream oil companies are prevented from falling into the red with the government issuing interest bearing bonds to partially compensate for the loss and the upstream oil companies, ONGC and OIL, shouldering part of the burden.

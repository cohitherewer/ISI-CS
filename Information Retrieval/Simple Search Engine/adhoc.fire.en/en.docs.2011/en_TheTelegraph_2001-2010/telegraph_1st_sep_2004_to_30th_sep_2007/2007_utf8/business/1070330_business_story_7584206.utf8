 Shipping gets short shrift in crude import

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Carry forward 

 New Delhi, March 29: The Union cabinet today overruled the objections of the shipping ministry and cleared the petroleum ministrys proposal to allow Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum to make their own shipping arrangements for importing crude.

 Indian Oil had received permission in 2005 on a trial basis to arrange ships to import its crude and will now be allowed to continue with the system on a permanent basis.

 The cabinet decision comes as a setback for Transchart, the chartering wing of the shipping ministry, which had been set up to make shipping arrangements for all the public sector companies. 

 The ministry had objected to oil companies breaking free of Transchart on the ground that this would lead to the creating of mini transcharts in all the public sector companies with added staff and duplication of work. 

 The shipping ministry has also pointed out that the oil companies would end up competing with each other for hiring ships and hence drive up freight costs. Transchart, on the other hand, as a central chartering agency also commanded more bargaining power because of the large business it handled. 

 Meanwhile, the petroleum ministry has raised the oil production target for ONGC by 6 per cent to 29.04 million tonnes (mt) for fiscal 2007-08 from 27.35 mt in the previous year.

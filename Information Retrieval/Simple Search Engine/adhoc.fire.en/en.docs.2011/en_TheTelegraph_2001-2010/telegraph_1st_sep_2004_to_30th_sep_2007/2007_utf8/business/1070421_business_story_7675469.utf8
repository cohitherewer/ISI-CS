 New Delhi, April 20: Samsung India today launched three LCD televisions and expressed the confidence to garner more than 50 per cent of the total market share in this segment.

 The market has grown exponentially in the flat TV segment. With the launch of the LCD series, we have tried to mix good technology with good art, Samsung India deputy managing director R. Zutshi said.

 The models include Mosel Blaque, Bordeaux Art and Sonoma Trenz. It has launched four models of plasma TV.

 The Korean chaebol will produce LCDs at its facility in Chennai. The unit will start operations in August 2007. It will have a capacity of 15 lakh colour TVs and 2 lakh LCDs. 

 The company will invest Rs 90.8 crore in the first phase of the project and Rs 319.2 crore in the second phase. The project is likely to be developed over five years. 

 Samsung India is keen to tap the potential in south India, said Zutshi. Setting up the unit in Chennai will bring down the cost of transportation. It will also be easier to export the products to Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, he added.

 Samsungs unit in Noida has a production capacity of 1.5 lakh colour TVs, monitors, air conditioners and refrigerators.Last year, Samsung sold 1.5 lakh flat panel televisions.

 Samsung claims it was the market leader in flat panel TV last year, having sold 1.5 lakh units. 

 Last years statistics show that the firm led in LCD and Plasma categories with 42.5 and 34.5 per cent shares in respective markets. Flat panel TVs will make up for 11 per cent of Samsungs television sales this year and at least 30 per cent by 2009.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 German interest in auto ancillary, steel

 A STAFF REPORTER

 NEW DIRECTION

 Calcutta, March 21: A visiting business delegation from Germany is interested in the steel and auto ancillary sectors in the state.

 The 81-member delegation, comprising small and medium enterprises from different sectors such as information technology and services, steel and metals, auto ancillary, biotech and pharmaceuticals, begun their quest for business opportunities in India from Mumbai two days ago.They are now visiting different states in smaller groups. A group of 19 members, largely from IT, ITeS, steel and metals has come to Bengal.

 Big German automotive companies, such as DaimlerChrysler, Volkswagen and BMW have either already invested or are in the process of setting up their manufacturing facilities in India. However, given the low cost of production here compared with that in Germany, we are looking at investment possibilities in the auto ancillary sector and make India the manufacturing and export hub for some auto components, said Satish K. Batra, president of the Horizon group of companies. Batra is also heading the German business delegation for steel and metals.

 In Bengal, we are particularly looking at the auto component and steel sectors. The state has traditionally been a leading manufacturer of steel and there are a number of steel plants here that need to be modernised. This offers a great business opportunity for the German steel makers, Batra said. 

 According to Batra, the delegation, represented by five steel makers from Germany, will meet representatives of Mecon and IISCO Steel Plant to explore investment opportunities in modernising the plants of these companies and making value-added products. We are focusing only on steel and not on other metals in the state, Batra said.

 The delegation will visit steel plants in Durgapur tomorrow.

 Meanwhile, the members of the delegation who are interested in auto component manufacturing have already met Bharat Forge officials in Pune. We are looking for tieups in forging business as Germany has little presence in this industry, Batra said.

 easyJet sees rise in earnings

 London, Feb. 7 (Reuters): Low-cost airline easyJet said on Wednesday its first-quarter revenue rose 15 per cent over the year-ago period, and predicted another sharp rise in pretax profits this year. 

 easyJet aims to improve pretax profit by 40 to 50 percent in the year to the end of September by holding down costs and focusing on selling extras like car hire, travel insurance, excess baggage, food and priority boarding.

 Last year, the group boosted pretax profit by 56 per cent to 129 million. 

 Analysts said the statement looked confident but the shares were already fully valued. 

 easyJet said on Wednesday it had launched five routes in the first quarter of the current year, including a service between Glasgow and London Gatwick three times a day. 

 The group said average fuel costs in the six months to the end of March would be 7 per cent higher than last year at around $650 per tonne, despite a recent slide in oil prices.

 Calcutta, June 6: Berger Paints has big plans for the little ones. 

 The company today launched its second do-it-yourself paint kit for children called Berger Kidz. It hopes to do business worth Rs 30 crore from this segment in three years.

 The market for paints aimed at kids is around Rs 5,000 crore and growing fast. 

 The company launched Galaxy a range of fluorescent colours that can be used to paint stars on the ceiling last year. The product was introduced in select cities and 30,000 packs have been sold so far. Each pack costs Rs 850 and can be used to paint 400sq ft.

 Berger Kidz is for walls. Using the do-it-yourself kits, parents or kids can paint their favourite Cartoon Network characters such as Powerpuff Girls, Johnny Bravo and Dexter on their walls. We have tied up with Cartoon Network Enterprises to use these characters, said P.K. Sengupta, head of retail decorative paints, Berger Paints.

 A Berger Kidz pack, with which one can paint 400-450sq ft, comes at a promotional price of Rs 1,650 a pack. The price may rise to Rs 2,000 in three months, said Abhijit Roy, senior general manager (marketing).

 We plan to sell between 2,000 and 2,500 packs of Berger Kidz per month. We are targeting a revenue of between Rs 3 crore and Rs 3.5 crore from the product in 2007-08. Together Galaxy and Berger Kidz should clock sales worth Rs 7-8 crore by the end of this fiscal, Roy added.

 Cartoon Network Enterprises (CNE), the merchandising arm of Cartoon Network, will get a royalty on the characters it has leased to Berger Paints depending on the sales volume of the paint. CNE has similar tieups with home furnishing makers such as Bombay Dyeing and Portico. It will lease more cartoon characters to Berger Paints. But those will be characters that CNE owns. Classic characters such as Tom and Jerry will not be leased out in the immediate future, said Jiggy George, executive director of Cartoon Network Enterprises.

 Cartoon Networks merchandising division contributes 10 per cent of Turner International Indias total revenue. Though we have started merchandising our cartoon characters two years ago, our business is growing at 50 per cent, George added.

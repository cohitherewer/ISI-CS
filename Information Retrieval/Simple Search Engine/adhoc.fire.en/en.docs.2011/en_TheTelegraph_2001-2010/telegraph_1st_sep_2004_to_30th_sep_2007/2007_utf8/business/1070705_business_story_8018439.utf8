 Tribunal stays Sebi order on Karvy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 4: The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) today stayed a Sebi order prohibiting Karvy Stock Broking from acting as a broker for three months and as a depository participant till the end of the year. The tribunals three-member bench comprised Justices N.K. Sondhi, Arun Bhargava and Uttpal Bhattacharya. 

 Sources said this could be a temporary respite for Karvy as the tribunal is yet to give a final order on the matter. The market regulator, in its June 22 order on the IPO scam, said the penalty would become effective after 21 days from the date of the order.

 Karvy had appealed against the order.

 According to the order, the registration certificate of Karvy, a member of the BSE, NSE and Hyderabad Stock Exchange, was to be suspended for three months. 

 The regulator had also prohibited Karvy Computershare from acting as a registrar to any issue for nine months.

 Sebi had said, It was fairly established that Karvy DP and the group was very much in the thick of the entire process of abuse of the IPO process and the penalty was imposed on the basis of the available materials on record.

 In 2005, the bourses submitted preliminary observations on the IPO of Yes Bank to the market regulator. 

 According to the exchanges, there were reasons to believe that some entities were involved in large-scale off-market transactions immediately after the date of allotment and prior to the listing on the bourses.

 Sebi later carried out a preliminary scrutiny and found that many demat accounts in benami/fictitious names were opened by certain entities, who had also cornered IPO shares. 

 In an interim order of December 15, 2005, the regulator restrained them from participating in all future IPOs and directed depositories to freeze their demat accounts.

 Later in April 2006, the regulator passed another interim order, which said Karvy Stock Broking did not appear to be fit to deal in the stock market as a Sebi-registered intermediary. 

 Subsequently, Sebi directed Karvy not to act as a depository participant, pending inquiry and final orders, except for acting on instructions of existing beneficiary owners.

 On November 21 last year, Sebi director G. Anantharaman had issued a disgorgement order in his second interim report into the IPO scam that directed the two depositories, NSDL and CDSL, and eight depositary participants, including Karvy Stockbrokers, HDFC Bank and IDBI Bank, to fork out Rs 115.82 crore as penalty for their involvement in the scam.

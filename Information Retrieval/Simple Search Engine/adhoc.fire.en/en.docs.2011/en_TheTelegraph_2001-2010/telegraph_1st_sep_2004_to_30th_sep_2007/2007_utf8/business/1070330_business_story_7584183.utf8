 FM defends ore levy

 Shenzhen (China), March 29 (PTI): Amid a threat of Chinese boycott of Indian iron ore due to the imposition of an export duty of Rs 300 per tonne, finance minister P. Chidambaram today defended the measure saying it will conserve the countrys raw materials for the domestic steel industry.

 There is no controversy. As I said in my budget speech, it is intended to conserve raw materials for our own steel industry and at the same time, create some revenues taking note of the fact that the prices are ruling very high, Chidambaram said here after inaugurating a branch of Bank of India.

 The new policy, announced in the Union budget, is regarded as the first move by India to conserve scarce national resources.

 But Chinese importers have decided to boycott Indian iron ore in protest against Indian suppliers attempts to increase ore prices. India announced a duty of Rs 300 ($6.78) per tonne of iron ore exported from March 1.

 Revival plan for regional banks 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 12: Three state regional rural banks will require a capital infusion of Rs 330 crore to wipe out their losses. The banks are Central Bank of India-sponsored Uttarbanga Grameen Bank, United Bank of India-promoted Bangio Grameen Bank and Uco Bank-controlled Paschimbanga Grameen Bank. 

 The state, which holds a 15 per cent stake in the banks, will provide Rs 50 crore. 

 The Union finance minister has said any state that is willing to infuse capital to the extent of its shareholding in regional rural banks to make their net worth positive will be taken up for recapitalisation, RBI deputy governor Usha Thorat said at the bankers committee meet here today. 

 If the state government provides its part which can be through bonds banks and the Union government can put in their share and the banks can be recapitalised to grow their balance sheet, she added. 

 Earlier, Bengal had nine regional rural banks, which was reduced to three after consolidation. The regional banks have 776 branches, while the commercial ones have 1,566. 

 The state has 17 district credit co-operative banks of which six have got licences from the RBI and two of them have negative net worth. The deposit and credit growth of these banks was around 10 per cent in 2006-07 against an overall growth of 23 per cent in deposits and 34 per cent in advances. Co-operative banks will have to step up their deposit mobilisation and credit delivery, Thorat said. The Reserve Bank has also initiated a process to revive urban cooperative banks. 

 We have signed memoranda of understanding with 13 states, including Bengal, last month for co-ordinated regulatory action to strengthen the urban cooperative banks. These are under the regulation of the Registrar of Cooperative Societies and the RBI. In most cases, the reason for their weakness is poor governance, Thorat said.

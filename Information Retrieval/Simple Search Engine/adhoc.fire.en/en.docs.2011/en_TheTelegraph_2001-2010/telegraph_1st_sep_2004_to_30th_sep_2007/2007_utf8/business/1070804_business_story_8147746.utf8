 Calcutta, Aug. 3: The information technology sector in Bengal will hire between 15,000 and 20,000 people next year. This year, around 12,000 to 15,000 additional jobs have been created in the sector.

 The city is also set to emerge as the third most attractive business process outsourcing destination in the world after Warsaw and Hyderabad by 2010, according to a survey by consulting firm neoIT. 

 We have a late start in IT. However, as part of our industrialisation plans, we will improve manufacturing as well as build a knowledge economy through IT. We are the first state in the country where all treasury functions, land records and even criminal records were computerised, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said at a function to inaugurate an IT park in Sector V.

 The government is also trying to decentralise growth in the sector and is planning a 400-acre infotech park in Kalyani and IT parks of 25 acres each in Siliguri and Durgapur.

 Calcutta has 40 lakh sqft of working space in IT. Another 20 lakh sqft will be added in the next three years. Many of these will be completed by 2009. So 2009 may emerge as another year of IT boom, said Bengal IT minister Debesh Das.

 The Rungta Group, in partnership with Sonodyne Television Co Ltd, has set up Millennium City, a 4.2 lakh sqft IT park in which 4000 professionals from companies such as IBM Global, Siemens, Tata Interactive Systems, Nokia and Alstom have their IT practice centres.

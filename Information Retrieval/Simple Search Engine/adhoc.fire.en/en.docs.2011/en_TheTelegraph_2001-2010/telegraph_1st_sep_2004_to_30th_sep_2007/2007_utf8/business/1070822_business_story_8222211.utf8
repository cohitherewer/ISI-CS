 Mumbai, Aug. 21: Siemens plans to double the size of its Indian operations over the next three years. The company will focus on domestic business, exports and sourcing along with new businesses such as public transport and water purification. 

 We have decided to double our business in India within next three years and do whatever it takes to achieve that. We are here to stay and grow, said Peter Lscher, president and CEO of Siemens AG. Lscher is on his first visit to Asia after taking charge in July. 

 Lscher, however, did not provide any details on how the operations would be doubled or the investment involved to achieve the goal. 

 Siemens now has 17 manufacturing plants in India and it operates in core business segments of energy, industry and buildings, information technology, communication, healthcare and lighting. 

 Lscher said the company was highly upbeat about Indias economic growth and areas such as public transport, power, infrastructure and healthcare would be a few of the focus areas. 

 Officials said initiatives such as the seven ultra mega power projects would usher in big opportunities for companies such as Siemens. The company is optimistic about opportunities in public transport and other emerging areas such as airport development, J. Schubert, managing director of Siemens India, said. 

 Another advantage is Indias strong set of skilled labour. Siemens has more than 16,500 employees and more than 10 per cent of its global software development takes place in India.

 Essar snaps up US steel firm

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 18: The Essar group strengthened its position in the North American market by snapping up Minnesota Steel LLC today. On Monday, the group acquired Algoma Steel Inc, Canadas third largest steel plant.

 Minnesota Steel comes with 1.4 billion tonnes of iron ore reserves and over 7,000 acres of land.

 Essar has acquired the complete ownership of the company for an undisclosed sum but would invest $1.65 billion to set up a 2.5-million-tonne steel plant there. Market sources, however, put the acquisition value at $80-90 million. The work on the project will start from the third quarter and will be completed by 2009. 

 Tata Steel had started the trend of overseas steel mill acquisitions by buying NatSteel in 2004. But Essar will be the first steel firm to set up a plant overseas. The project will come up on the Mesabi iron range of northeast Minnesota. This is likely to be North Americas first steel complex to have ore mining, ore processing and steel making in a single location with good economies of scale.

 Shashi Ruia, chairman of Essar Global, the investment arm of the group, said: Our investment in Minnesota Steel gives us a cornerstone in the North American market. We will expand our global steel business.

 By developing the iron ore resources of Minnesota Steel, the company can be one of the low-cost producers of steel in the world, he added.

 The company will use natural gas as fuel to manufacture steel by direct reduced iron method.

 We are pleased to have Essar as our partner in future, said Joseph C. Bennett, chairman of Minnesota Steel. Essar brings remarkable experience and expertise in DRI/EAF steelmaking, he added. The Bennett family is in the Minnesota iron ore business since the 1890s.

 Earlier this month, the 45-day public comment period on the projects draft environmental impact statement ended. After the statement is found to have addressed all potential impacts, Federal and state environmental officials can issue permits, which are expected this summer. Construction will begin after that.

 In December, the State of Minnesota approved a 7,000-plus-acre land swap to ensure enough acreage for the operations of Minnesota Steel.

 In November, Minnesota Steel secured capacity to transport low-cost natural gas from Alberta, Canada, via the Great Lakes Gas Transmission Co, saving up to 70 per cent on transmission rates.

 Small car exports up 16%

 JAYATI GHOSE

 New Delhi, July 10: Auto companies are betting big on small car exports. India exported 13,845 small cars in June 2007 compared with 11,924 a year ago, an increase of 16 per cent.

 Availability of cheap manpower, coupled with manufacturing and engineering competitiveness, make India an attractive car manufacturing base, said Anisha Motwani, director (marketing) of General Motors. The company is planning to export its Chevrolet Spark to Saarc countries.

 Analysts said auto majors were raising their small car export targets as interest rates were affecting domestic sales. 

 Hyundai Motor India Limited, the largest exporter of passenger cars from the country, is planning to export over 1.3 lakh small cars by the end of 2007.

 We are looking at exporting around 40-45 per cent of the total production from our new factory in Chennai. Manufacturing cars in a large scale here and then exporting them provides economies of scale, said Rajiv Mitra, DGM (corporate communications), Hyundai Motor India.

 Hyundai Motor India is building a second factory in Chennai, which will double its capacity to 300,000 vehicles a year from October.

 Hyundai exports to 67 countries in Latin America, Europe, Africa and West Asia.

 The company has about 60 per cent share of exports in 2006-07, with its flagship Santro accounting for over 91 per cent of its global sales. 

 Till June 2007, Hyundai sold around 48,773 Santros, 7,600 units of the Getz and 3,996 Accents.

 Maruti Udyog Limited, which enjoys around 20 per cent share of the export market, sold 38,000 passenger cars in 2006-07, which is around 6.4 per cent of its total sales.

 The company has set an export target of around 220,000 units by 2010 and is exploring new markets such as the UAE, the Philippines and Indonesia. 

 It has already started shipments of its small car Alto to the UAE.

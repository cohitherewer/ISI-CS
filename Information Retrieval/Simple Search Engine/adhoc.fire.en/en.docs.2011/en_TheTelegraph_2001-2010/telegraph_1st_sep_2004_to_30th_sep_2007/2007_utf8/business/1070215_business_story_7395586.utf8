 Coca-Cola Q4 net profit drops

 New York, Feb. 14 (Reuters): Coca-Cola Co, the worlds largest soft-drink maker, has reported lower fourth-quarter net profit, hurt by a $2.9 billion impairment charge at its largest bottler.

 Net income fell to $678 million, or 29 cents per share, from $864 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier.

 Excluding items that included the charge from Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc, earnings were 52 cents per share.

 Analysts on average were expecting 50 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.

 In recent years, Coke and rival PepsiCo Inc have been trying to expand their product lines as consumers in many developed markets shift from sugary soft drinks in favour of healthier beverages, such as water and orange juice.

 Last week PepsiCo, the worlds No 2 soft drink company, reported a 61 per cent rise in quarterly profit, but its shares fell on weak demand for its Gatorade sports drink and a conservative forecast.

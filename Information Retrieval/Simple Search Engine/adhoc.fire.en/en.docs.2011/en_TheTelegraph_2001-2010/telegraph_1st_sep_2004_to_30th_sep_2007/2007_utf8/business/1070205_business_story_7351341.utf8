 Q amp;A

 Sharing gains

 I am 62 years old and a taxpayer. I made a capital gain of Rs 30,000 by selling some shares that were in my possession for four years. In another share sale deal, I gained Rs 1,000 after three months. Will the capital gains tax calculation be different for the two cases?

 Samir Kumar Das, Calcutta

 With reference to your first deal, you dont have to pay any capital gains tax if those shares were bought after March 2003. In the second case, you will have to pay a short-term capital gains tax at the rate of 10 per cent on the gain amount. 

 House proud

 I had purchased a plot of land about 50 years ago and built a house there. I recently sold the house for Rs 16 lakh. How much capital gains tax I shall have to pay? Should I invest the whole amount or part of it in REC or NHAI bonds? I learnt that REC and NHAI are not accepting any deposit now. What should I do then? 

 D.K. Mukherjee, Calcutta

 You will have to pay long-term capital gains tax at the rate of 20 per cent on the gain amount from the sale of the property. However, you can avail of the indexation benefit to reduce your tax outgo. If you dont want to pay the tax, you will have to invest the gain amount either in bonds of REC or NHAI or else you can buy another house with the money. If you choose to invest in bonds, you will have to do it within six months from the transfer of the title of the property to the buyer. If you want to invest in another house, you have three years time.

 Tax concern

 Does a person holding a PAN need to inform the income tax department for non-submission of return for fiscal 2006-07 as his or her annual income is less than or equal to Rs 1 lakh (and Rs 1.85 lakh in case of senior citizens)?

 Pradip Kumar Sen, Sodhpur

 Submission of income tax return is voluntary below the threshold for different groups of assessees. You can submit your income tax return even with a zero-tax liability. For non-submission, you dont have inform anyone.

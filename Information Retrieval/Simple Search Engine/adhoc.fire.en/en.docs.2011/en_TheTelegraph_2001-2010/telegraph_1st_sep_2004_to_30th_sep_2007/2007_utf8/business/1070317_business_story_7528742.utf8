 Big bonus for wheat growers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 16: The government today announced a bonus of Rs 100 per quintal for farmers selling wheat to the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and prepared for imports of up to three million tonnes of the cereal in an effort to build stocks and rein in rising prices.

 The government has also decided to permit private traders to import wheat duty-free till the end of December 2007 to augment availability. 

 Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar announced in Parliament that the government has decided to increase the price for FCI procurement from farmers by Rs 100 per quintal. 

 The government had earlier announced a price of Rs 750 per quintal, but officials fear that given the high prices of wheat in the open market, the grain will flow to private traders. 

 The fact that Uttar Pradesh is going to the polls is also reported to be an important consideration for announcing the Rs 100 bonus as it will help garner rural votes.

 Pawar said the government has decided to raise the price it would offer to farmers to ensure that they get better returns.

 I hope that our farmers will welcome this announcement and contribute more to our procurement operations, Pawar said.

 Meanwhile, the government today ruled out that it was considering a proposal to create a buffer stock of sugar worth Rs 250 crore to bail out the industry, which is expected to witness a bumper crop of 230-240 lakh tonnes in 2006-07 season against the likely demand of 190 lakh tonnes.

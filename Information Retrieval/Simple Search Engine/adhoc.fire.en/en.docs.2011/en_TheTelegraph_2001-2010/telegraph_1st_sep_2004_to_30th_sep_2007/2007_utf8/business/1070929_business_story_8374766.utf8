 Risk cover for taxi, auto drivers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Health is wealth

 Calcutta, Sept. 28: The Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) plans to provide insurance cover to all taxi and autorickshaw drivers in the city and porters at Howrah and Sealdah railway stations. 

 We are working on the scheme for taxi and autorickshaw drivers with the Bengal government. We also hope to provide medical protection to porters at Howrah and Sealdah stations through a social security scheme, B.K. Sahu, ESICs additional commissioner and regional director, said at an interactive session organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today.

 Since last year, employees of medical and educational institutions in the state are covered under ESI benefits. The Union government is planning to enact a bill for the unorganised sector and, I believe, the ESIC will have an important role to play, Sahu said.

 The ESIC, which runs 14 hospitals with 3,777 beds in the state, is developing a 100-bed hospital in Haldia. In Haldia the number of member employees is growing rapidly, Sahu said.

 The ESIC will also offer its services in Kharagpur, Kulti and Siliguri. 

 However, as the number of members in Siliguri is less than 10,000 we cannot set up a hospital there. We need a minimum of 20,000 members to set up a hospital, said a senior official of the ESIC.

 The corporation is also talking to private hospitals to rent idle beds in the ESIC-run hospitals. We are talking to Devi Shettys group and Asansol Hospital. But nothing has been finalised. The occupancy rate at our hospitals is between 75 and 80 per cent. The idea is to use the idle capacity, Sahu said. 

 The corporation is also taking steps to monitor disbursals under sickness and cash benefits to insured employees.

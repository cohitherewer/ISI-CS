 Bancrofts agree to talks with Murdoch

 Murdoch: Close to win

New York, June 1 (Reuters): The family that controls Dow Jones amp; Co said for the first time it would consider selling the publisher of the Wall Street Journal to Rupert Murdochs News Corp, dropping its outright opposition to his $5-billion bid.

 The Bancroft family, which controls 64 per cent of Dow Joness voting power, said it would also look at offers from other bidders. Dow Jones in a separate statement said the board would consider News Corps offer and other approaches.

 The Bancroft decision is a change from its earlier rejection of Murdochs $60-a-share bid, and brings the publisher of The Wall Street Journal closer to being sold after more than a century of being independent.

 The family has reached a consensus that the mission of Dow Jones may be better accomplished in combination or collaboration with another organisation, which may include News Corp, the Bancrofts said in a statement.

 The family said it would meet with Murdoch and News Corp representatives to see if they can find a way to protect the editorial independence of Dow Jones after a sale.

 A date for the meeting has not yet been set, but the expectation is that an initial meeting would take place in a timely manner, said a source close to the Bancrofts.

 We are grateful that the Bankcroft family has agreed to our suggestion to meet, said News Corp spokesman Andrew Butcher. We look forward to sitting down with members of the family in the near future.

 Most of the Bancrofts have opposed the bid over worries that News Corp chairman and chief executive Rupert Murdoch would tarnish the journals reputation and interfere with the way its reporters cover the news.

 Still, the family may be hard-pressed to find another bidder that could top News Corps bid, said Benchmark Co analyst Ed Atorino. 

 I think theyre facing the reality of the situation that this is a one-time-only event, he said.

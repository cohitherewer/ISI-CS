 Gas prices to follow bidding route

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 8: Companies selling natural gas will have to fix their prices through the competitive bidding route. 

 The ministry of petroleum and natural gas has accepted the recommendation of a committee that prescribed price discovery through competitive bidding, a release said today. 

 The committee, headed by the ministrys joint secretary and financial adviser, was set up to prepare transparent guidelines for the pricing of natural gas.

 Once a market-determined price has been discovered by the suppliers and customers through a transparent competitive bidding process, there should be no need for the government to interfere, the release said. 

 In cases where the price is not determined through competitive bidding, it will be indexed to the most recently competitively determined price in the region.

 Reliance Industries is a major player in natural gas. It will begin production of the gas from its oil block in the Krishna-Godavari basin off the Andhra coast from July 2008. 

 The company has not yet firmed up the selling price. It will now have to follow the new guidelines to determine the price of the gas.

 Ford to recast Jaguar, Rover books

 Gearing up

 London, June 24 (Reuters): Ford Motor Co has hired accountancy group KPMG to examine the books at its British units Jaguar and Land Rover ahead of their expected sale later this year, The Sunday Times has reported.

 The newspaper, which did not name the source of its information, said KPMG had been given a mandate to revamp the companies accounts so that they are in a proper form to be examined by would-be buyers.

 KPMGs main task will be giving a clear picture of Jaguar and Land Rovers performance as businesses separate from the influence of Ford, the paper said, adding that the accounting firm was also understood to have been asked to examine the companies pension liabilities.

 Officials at Ford and KPMG were not immediately available for comment.

 Earlier this month, Ford said it was working with financial advisers on the best options for Jaguar and Land Rover as it continued a strategic review of its global operations.

 Sources familiar with the matter said Ford had hired investment banks including Goldman Sachs, HSBC Holdings Plc and Morgan Stanley to help the automaker explore the sale of the two brands.

 Ford has faced scrutiny over how it will raise and maintain its cash position as it restructures its money-losing North American operations. It could get a cash-infusion from the sale of the two nameplates.

 Analysts said Ford was still burning cash and contract talks with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union were looming, which strengthened the case for asset sales.

 Citigroup analyst Jon Rogers said a sale of Jaguar and Land Rover could benefit Ford as the two divisions were not at the core of the automakers overall business and cash from the sale could be used to accelerate its North American restructuring.

 Another possible use of cash could be funding for UAW-managed healthcare plan, Rogers said.

 The profitability of Fords Premier Automotive Group has been volatile.

 Land Rover expects to be profitable this year. However, Jaguar is suffering losses.

 Ford could raise between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion through a combined sale of Jaguar and Land Rover, Merrill Lynch analyst John Murphy said recently.

 Citigroups Rogers, however, estimates the two brands will raise about $8 billion.

 The automaker, which is on track to lose its No. 2 spot in the US market to fast-growing rival Toyota Motor Corp, sold Aston Martin in March for $925 million but last month denied that it was in talks to sell Volvo.

 Ford is in the midst of a sweeping restructuring in North America. 

 It lost $12.6 billion last year and another $282 million during the first quarter with further losses forecast this year.

 By its own estimate, Fords North American unit will lose money until 2009 and run through $17 billion cash in the next three years.

 Separately, Ford said it had reached a preliminary deal to sell its auto lights business and an accompanying plant in Sandusky, Ohio, to privately-held Meridian Automotive Systems. Terms were not disclosed.

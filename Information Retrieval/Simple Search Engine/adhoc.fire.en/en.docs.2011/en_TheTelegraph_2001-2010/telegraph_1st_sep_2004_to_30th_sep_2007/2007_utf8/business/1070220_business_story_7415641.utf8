 Alps weaves Rs 500cr capacity expansion

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 19: Ghaziabad-based Alps Industries will invest Rs 500 crore to add 68,000 spindles to its existing 2 lakh to manufacture home furnishing articles. 

 We will add weaving and spinning capacity to our plants at Hardwar and Ghaziabad and will install jacquard looms at our Pondicherry plant, said Sanjay Gupta, general manager of Alps Industries.

 According to Gupta, the investment to hike capacity will be made over the next six to seven months. It will be funded by internal accruals, term loans and proceeds from the GDR that were raised by the company last year. 

 Alps Industries plans to double its revenue to Rs 500 crore in two years from Rs 250 crore now. We have adopted a two-pronged strategy to achieve this goal, Gupta said.

 First, we will increase our production capacity. Our focus is on the home furnishing segment. Besides raising the spinning and weaving capacity, we will also increase our production of organic cotton fabric the niche product segment, he added.

 Alps Industries, which makes the Vista brand of home furnishings and the Le Pashmina fashion accessories, also makes bedsheets and other home dcor fabric using organic cotton and natural dyes. 

 Through contract farming in Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh, Alps produces 500 tonnes of organic cotton from 4,000 hectares. We have decided to double the area under contract farming within two years, Gupta said.

 The company has chalked out a major retail expansion plan as another strategy to increase its revenue. 

 We will open 600 exclusive retail stores for Alps products over the next two to three years, Gupta said.

 However, the company will not venture into retailing itself. All these stores will be run on franchisee basis, Gupta said.

 According to him, the minimum size of such a store will be 300 sq ft and the maximum will be 2,000 sq ft. The company has budgeted an ad spend of Rs 18 crore. 

 Alps Industries, which makes home furnishing products for global brands like Habitat (UK), Wal-Mart, Target, Park B Smith and I Care, has an export earnings of Rs 60 crore. We mainly export to the US and the UK, Gupta said.

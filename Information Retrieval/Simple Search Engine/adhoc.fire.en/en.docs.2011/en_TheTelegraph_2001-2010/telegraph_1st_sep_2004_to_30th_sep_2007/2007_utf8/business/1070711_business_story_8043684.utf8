 Suzlon IPO end-use under lens 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 10: The government wants a thorough probe into the use of IPO funds by Suzlon Energy.

 The Registrar of Companies has recommended the action after inspecting the finances of the wind energy major. Suzlon had made the initial public offering (IPO) in 2005.

 The company affairs ministry is very particular about the way funds raised from the public are used. The registrar of companies suspects there may be some problems and consequently it has sought a larger investigation by the department of company affairs. No wrongdoing is in our sight at this point of time, top officials of the department of company affairs said. 

 The officials said an audit of Suzlon by SR Batliboi, dated May 15, 2006, had revealed unsecured loans worth Rs 114 crore to three entities. 

 The company has also invested about Rs 280 crore in some 18 subsidiaries.

 The RoC has suspicions, not facts, the officials stressed.

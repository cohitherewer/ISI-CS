 TCL India mulls third facility

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 9: TCL India Holdings Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the $4.7-billion Chinese consumer electronics company TCL, is looking for a partner to start a third manufacturing facility at an investment of around Rs 60 crore.

 The company will also launch home appliances such as rice cookers, magnetic induction cookers, fans and microwave ovens.

 We already have two third party contract manufacturers in Dehradun and Pondicherry. Our colour televisions and air conditioners are manufactured here while washing machines and DVD players are imported as completely built units. After the launch of the appliances, some products will be sold through our existing channels and we have to create new channels for the others, said Warren Wang, managing director of TCL India Holdings Pvt Ltd.

 The company, which clocked a turnover of Rs 325 crore last calendar year, expects to maintain its 30 per cent growth rate. Wang said India would overtake China as the largest colour television market in two years.

 Around 20 million colour TVs are sold in China every year compared with 12 million in India. TCL, under brand names RCA and the TCL-Thomson Electronics, sells around 31 million TVs globally. The company plans to launch 25 models this year. 

 It also plans to launch two models each of ACs, DVDs and washing machines.

 TCL, which has a market share of less than five per cent in the country, is aiming for a 10 per cent share by 2009 .

 TCL has an 8 per cent market share in the eastern region for its TVs.

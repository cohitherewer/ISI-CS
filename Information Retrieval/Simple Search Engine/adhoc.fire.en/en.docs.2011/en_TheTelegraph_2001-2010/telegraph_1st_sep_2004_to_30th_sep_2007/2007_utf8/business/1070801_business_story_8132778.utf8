 Mumbai, July 31: Tata Motors has registered a 22 per cent growth in net profit in the quarter ended June 30 at Rs 466.76 crore against Rs 381.85 crore during the corresponding quarter a year ago.

 A steep increase in input costs and a drop in the sales volume of medium and heavy trucks have impacted the operating margins during the quarter, the company said. Its operating margin has come down to 9 per cent from 13 per cent in the year-ago period.

 We have lost our market share in light commercial vehicles and medium and heavy commercial vehicles because of a rise in input costs, commodity prices, crude oil prices, hardening interest rates and inflationary pressures. But in the passenger car segment our market share has increased, Ravi Kant, managing director of Tata Motors, said.

 The company said its sales volume in commercial vehicles has declined almost 2 per cent to 61,633 vehicles from 63,082 in the first quarter of the previous year. Domestic sales of passenger vehicles have grown 5 per cent at 52,573 units.

 During the quarter, the companys total sales volume, including exports, stood at 128,095 vehicles against 126,394 in the same period last year.

 Its consolidated revenues grew 13 per cent to Rs 7,631.28 crore from Rs 6,733.32 crore.

 Tata Motors exported 13,889 vehicles during the quarter against 13,161 in the year-ago period, representing a growth of 6 per cent. The companys international business accounts for about 20 per cent of the total revenues.

 The company said the production of the Rs 1-lakh car would commence by the middle of next year. 

 We are striving hard to meet the price target of our Rs 1 lakh car. When we announced the price of this car about three years back, the market conditions were different from what they are today. We expect to roll out this car next year, Kant said.

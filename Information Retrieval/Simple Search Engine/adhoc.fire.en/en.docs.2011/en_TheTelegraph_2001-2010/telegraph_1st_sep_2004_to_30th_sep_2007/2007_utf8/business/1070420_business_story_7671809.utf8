 Calcutta, April 19: The state governments department of information technology (IT) is set to sign a joint venture MoU with Denmark-based Wireless Innovation Platform (WIP) Labs.

 WIP Labs is setting up its first Indian centre in the city. 

 The company will invest Rs 200 crore over a two-year period on the centre.

 We are looking at signing an MoU to form a joint venture with WIP Labs, which is coming to India. The MoU will enable the Bengal government to have a share of the revenues from the products and services of WIP Labs, Debesh Das, state minister for information technology, said.

 WIP Labs has acquired 20-acres in New Town, Rajarhat.

 The company holds 15 patents and plans to give shape to five concepts that are on the drawing boards.

 The company will build solutions for new communication platforms such as 3G, 4G, Wi-Fi and WiMax. 

 The first product will be launched in 2008-09.

 Besides product development, WIP Labs will provide consultancy services to the cellular companies.

 The company is also planning to develop connectivity solutions for rural India.

 The opportunity for revenue sharing looks brighter with the domestic telecom market growing rapidly, Das said.

 Bengal now provides a conducive environment to foreign companies. I am going to meet the governor and the chief minister next week to discuss opportunities, Ole Lonsmann Poulsen, Ambassador of Denmark, said.

 Besides Chennai and Hyderabad, Calcutta is a strong contender for the Danish Centre for TeleInFrastruktur (CTIF), which plans to set up base in the country.

 Calcutta is one of our choices to set up this centre for communication technologies and tele-infrastructure, said Ramjee Prasad, director, CTIF.

 The institute also wants to work with TCS, Wipro and Infosys on research projects.

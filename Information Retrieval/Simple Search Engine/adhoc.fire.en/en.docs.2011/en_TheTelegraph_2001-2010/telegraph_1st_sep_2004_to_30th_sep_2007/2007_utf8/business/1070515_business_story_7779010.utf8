 New Delhi, May 14: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said a poor farm growth of less than 2 per cent has hit rural areas hard and promised incentives to double it to 4 per cent in the next five years. 

 Singh met cabinet colleagues and plan panel members today to chalk out a strategy to raise agricultural growth and put more money into farmers pockets.

 The government will work to increase farm productivity from 1.5 tonnes per hectare to 2.5 tonnes per hectare in the eastern states of Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Orissa along with eastern Uttar Pradesh.

 The area growing high-yielding hybrid rice will be increased from 1 million hectares to 10 million hectares. The government will set up a fund of Rs 841 crore which will encourage farmers to sow more wheat in the eastern states. 

 Planning Commission officials said the plan approved today could bring about a Green Revolution in eastern India. 

 Reversing the slowdown in agriculture and raising its growth to 4 per cent per annum is necessary for the well-being of the large population and to ensure equitable, inclusive growth, he said.

 The Prime Minister also wants states to step up expenditure in the farm sector to at least 6 per cent of their total outlay from 3.5 per cent now.

 Plan panel officials said while the Centre would be stepping up investment in farm infrastructure, it should provide incentives to states to boost irrigation and introduce new high-yield seeds.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram today questioned the feasibility of the Planning Commissions proposal to transfer more resources to states as additional central assistance (ACA) for funding agricultural growth.

 It is not clear what will be the size of the envelope that can be accommodated under the ACA method. I doubt whether large outlays for sectors, which require substantial funds can be channelised through the ACA, Chidambaram said while making an intervention during the full Planning Commission meeting here.

 Normally, the finance minister further said, such large outlays are routed through the finance commission or the planning commission after taking into account overall resource availability and inter-sectoral and inter-state allocations.

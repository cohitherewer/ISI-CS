 Panel in a week to pick ONGC chief

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi, Feb. 7: Petroleum minister Murli Deora today said a committee would be formed within a week to conduct fresh interviews to select the new ONGC chairman-cum-managing director in the next three months.

 Yesterday, the Prime Ministers office scrapped the selection of acting ONGC chairman and director (finance) R.S. Sharma.

 The ONGC officers association appealed to the Prime Minister to have a presidential order issued to appoint the candidates selected by the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB). 

 Deora said he did not know the reasons for not confirming Sharmas appointment. I dont know. Go and ask them (PMO), he said.

 According to petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan, the government wanted a private sector person to head the pubic sector oil giant.

 The Appointments Committee of the cabinet wanted a wider pool of talents, including that from the private sector, to be invited for consideration of a body that is wider than the conventional PESB, Srinivasan said.

 However, a senior official also said Sharma has not been disqualified and could apply for the job again.

 Sharma has been officiating as the CMD of ONGC since May-end 2006, when the government decided not to extend the term of former chairman Subir Raha. Sharma was recommended for the top job by the PESB on August 30, 2006.

 Usually, after the PESB recommends a candidate to head a public sector enterprise, it is approved by the Appointments Committee of the cabinet headed by the Prime Minister. 

 But in Sharmas case, the last-minute rejection is a bolt from the blue as he had all the necessary clearances from the CBI, IB and CVC.

 The new search panel will be headed by PESB chairman and would comprise members of PESB, the petroleum secretary and two independent eminent personalities, Srinivasan said. I think the entire process will be over in three months, he added.

 This is the first instance that independent members are being included in the selection process. 

 Sources said Sharmas candidature had all the necessary clearances from ministries of petroleum, home affairs and personnel.

 The government has not given A.K. Hazarika, ONGC director (onshore), who was the selection panels second choice, a chance to take over the company either and scrapped the entire selection process.

 Hazarika is reported to have had all his papers in order but the government has decided to hold interviews afresh. There have been earlier instances of the second best candidate being selected for the post in case the number one choice is not deemed fit for some reasons. This, however, did not happen in Hazarikas case. ONGC officials are unhappy with the PMOs decision.

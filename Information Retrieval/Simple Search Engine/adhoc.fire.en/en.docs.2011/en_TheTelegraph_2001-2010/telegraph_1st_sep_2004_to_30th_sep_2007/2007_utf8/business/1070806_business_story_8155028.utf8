 Jindals gear up for steel unit in Russia

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Looking ahead

 Calcutta, Aug. 5: Jindal Stainless Ltd is planning to set up a plant in Russia to cater to the automobile industry there.

 In the initial phase, the company plans to set up a unit having a capacity of 40,000 tonnes per annum at an estimated investment of $60 million.

 The plant likely to be a cold rolling mill may come up in St. Petersburg, where companies such as Ford and Toyota have set up shop. 

 Jindal Stainless will start work on the plant in 2008-09 if it signs a deal with the Russian authorities. Company officials, however, declined to comment on the development of the project.

 The company had acquired Maspion Stainless Indonesia a cold rolling mill in 2004. The move was driven by a need to split manufacturing operations, the same tactics that were behind Tata Steels acquisition of Corus earlier this year.

 JSL supplies hot rolled coils, which are manufactured in India, to the Indonesian plant. The coils are then cold rolled there and marketed in Southeast Asia and all over the world.

 The Russian plant is likely to be modelled along similar lines. It will be a processing unit for cold rolling to cater to the local customers.

 The company exports over 60 per cent of its products to 50 countries. JSL has marketing offices in many countries, including Russia.

 Jindal Stainless is also building a 1.6-million-tonne integrated stainless steel plant in Orissa in three phases. It will set up a 1.5-million-tonne ferro alloy unit, a power plant and a coke oven unit at an investment of Rs 2,250 crore in the first phase.

 In the second phase, a 0.8 million-tonne stainless steel plant will be set up at an investment of over Rs 5,600 crore.

 It is also increasing the capacity of its plant at Hisar, Haryana to 0.9 million tonnes from 0.6 million tonnes. The capacity of the Indonesian plant will be doubled to 300,000 tonnes from 150,000 tonnes.

 Apart from new manufacturing units, the company is also scouting for ferro alloy mines abroad to ensure adequate supply for its Indian operations.

 If its domestic expansion plans are implemented, JSL will become one of the top five producers of stainless steel.

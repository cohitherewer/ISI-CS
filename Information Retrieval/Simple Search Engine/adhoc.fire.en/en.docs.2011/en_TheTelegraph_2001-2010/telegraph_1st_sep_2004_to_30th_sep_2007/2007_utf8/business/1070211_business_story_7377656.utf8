 Mumbai, Feb. 10: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the government would take all measures to control inflation, which on Friday hit a two-year high of 6.58 per cent due to soaring food prices. 

 Chidambaram said the Centre is planning to fight the price spiral through fiscal and monetary measures. Many steps are being taken on the fiscal side. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is also taking measures to see that the monetary situation is under control, he said while addressing the Association of NSE Members of India convention. 

 The government had earlier cut import duties on certain items to tackle the problem. The finance minister added that the rise in inflation was due to strong consumer demand and that the government is concerned about inflationary pressures. 

 However, there were no short-term solutions to supply side bottlenecks, he pointed out. 

 Explaining the circumstances, he said that even as Indias GDP is growing at a healthy rate of 9 per cent, the growth in credit was over 30 per cent and money supply is growing at around 21 per cent.

 This is an unusual combination of factors, he said. He was, however, positive that the government will be successful in its efforts to bring down inflation. 

 Sebi act

 Chidambaram said comprehensive amendments to the Sebi Act were being planned to launch the Investor Protection Fund (IPF) and that the government will launch a package to enhance financial literacy skills soon.

 We need to advance the level of investor protection and impart financial literary skills at an early stage. We will come up with a financial literacy package, free of cost for schools and colleges, Chidambaram said.

 A comprehensive amendment to the Sebi Act was under examination, he said, adding that an IPF will be set up soon as announced by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh earlier.

 However, the total income (net of excise) declined by 10.4 per cent to Rs 681 crore for the June quarter against Rs 760.06 crore for the same period last year, the Tata group company has informed the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 The consolidated PAT of the group increased to Rs 137.38 crore from Rs 88.61 crore, while its consolidated income decreased to Rs 1,146.35 crore from Rs 1,216.65 crore last year.

 Ceat profit zooms

 Tyre major Ceat Ltd has reported a multi-fold increase in its net profit for the quarter ended June 30 at Rs 30.35 crore against Rs 0.23 crore in the same period last fiscal.

 Gross sales were Rs 601 crore, up 8 per cent from Rs 557 crore registered in the same period a year ago, the company said.

 Ceat said its EBITDA margin to net sales surged by 490 basis points during the quarter to 9.9 per cent from 5 per cent for the same period in the previous year.

 The increase in operating margins is mainly attributed to better product mix, strategic buying of raw materials and sustained efforts towards cost optimisation and lower interest burden despite increase in interest rates and a growth in business, Ceat managing director Paras K. Chowdhary said.

 Godrej Industries has posted a 97 per cent jump in net profit for the quarter ended June 30 at Rs 32.5 crore over the previous year. 

 Its revenues have gone up 11 per cent compared with last year, the company said in a statement.

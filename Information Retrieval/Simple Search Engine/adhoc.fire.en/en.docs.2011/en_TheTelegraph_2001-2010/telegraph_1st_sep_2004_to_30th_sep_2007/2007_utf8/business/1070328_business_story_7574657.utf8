 Investment need to fuel credit growth

 BIG LEAP

 Calcutta, March 27: Leading public and private sector banks in the country are poised for a big leap.

 A research report on the domestic banking sector by a prominent brokerage house points out that banks benefited most from the rise in consumption and investment demands, the two key constituents of growth. 

 This change in trend has led to the massive growth in demand for retail credit between 2002-03 and 2005-06, the study by Emkay Shares amp; Stock Brokers said.

 Moreover, the penetration of credit in the country is still very low, so the scope for consumption credit growth is very high, it added.

 At the same time, a higher demand for goods and services has resulted in more capacity utilisation in the industry. This in turn has led to a stronger investment demand for capacity expansion. The rising investment in the industrial and services sectors has resulted in higher household income and hence higher demand for retail credit.

 Increased investment in the infrastructure sector has fuelled the credit boom, the study noted. These three components of credit growth have formed a sort of self-sustaining triangle, it said.

 According to the study, rural credit, particularly the non-agricultural sector in the rural economy, has of late caught the fancy of the banking sector. With more than half of the rural gross domestic product coming from non-agricultural activities, we believe that rural non-agriculture lending by banks is going to be a big driver for the growth of bank credit in the near future, the study said. 

 Credit growth has remained robust at around 30 per cent despite two successive hikes in prime lending rates by the public sector banks in the last six months. The fact that the huge loan growth has come with the increase in the yield on advances vindicates that domestic banks have got the power to pass on the increased cost of funds to their customers, the study said.

 However, with the systematic rise in interest rates, it will increasingly be difficult for banks to increase their low-cost deposit base.

 FIs give new twist to Haldia tussle

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Eye of the storm

 Calcutta, March 12: The ongoing legal battle between The Chatterjee Group (TCG) and the Bengal government over Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) has taken a new turn today with financial institutions (FIs) joining the tussle.

 Lenders to HPL, led by IDBI, has moved Calcutta High Court challenging the Company Law Board (CLB) order asking the state to pass on the reins of Haldia Petro to TCG by selling its stake.

 IDBI said in the appeal that the lenders were aggrieved that the dispute between TCG and the Bengal government had been linked to the allotment of HPL shares to them

 It also said the share transfer from the government to TCG, as directed by the CLB order of January 31, 2007, was without the consent of IDBI and other consortium bankers. IDBIs case was moved by Debanjan Mandal of the solicitor firm Fox amp; Mandal.

 According to the corporate debt restructuring (CDR) package approved by lenders, IDBI and bankers were to be allotted Rs 135 crore of shares at par by converting loans. 

 The same package had also included offering fresh shares worth Rs 150 crore to Indian Oil (IOC). The CLB case started when TCG disputed allotment to Indian Oil. 

 Even as the HPL board approved the allotment to FIs, it was never made. CLB later restrained HPL from allotting the shares to the lenders.

 In its January 31 judgement, CLB said IDBI and other 36 lenders would be issued shares simultaneously with registration of 520 million shares in favour of TCG group companies. Going by the judgment, IDBI and lenders would have to wait unless the shares were transferred to TCG.

 Given that WBIDC has moved court challenging CLBs diktat, the allotment of shares to IDBI cannot take place until the matter is resolved between two warring shareholders.

 Caught in the crossfire, lenders now want shares to be allotted irrespective of the dispute between shareholders. And it also wants to preserve the right to approve any transfer of HPL shares, especially from WBIDC to TCG.

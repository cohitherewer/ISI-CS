 Maruti stake sale gathers speed

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: The government has invited bids to sell its residual stake in Maruti Udyog valued at around Rs 2,600 crore on the basis of its current stock price.

 Mutual funds, state-run financial institutions and banks have been asked to submit initial offers for the 10.27 per cent stake which could be sold at a premium as the fundamentals of the countrys biggest car manufacturer, controlled by Japanese auto major Suzuki, are strong. 

 The department of disinvestment has invited minimum offers of Rs 10 crore which are to be submitted by March 9.

 The government is keeping the option open to sell only a part of the total shares on offer as it does not want to depress the price by offloading too many shares. 

 The value of the Maruti stake, amounting to 29.68 million shares, is based on the average price of the stock on the Bombay Stock Exchange over the last two days. The scrip is now ruling around Rs 900.

 Maruti, which is 54.2 per cent owned by Japans Suzuki Motor Corp, rolls out half of the cars sold in the country. The company makes 10 models, including the WagonR and Swift hatchbacks, at its factory in Gurgaon.

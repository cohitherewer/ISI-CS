 ITC sets sights on EU

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 4: ITCs ready-to-eat products, under the Kitchens of India brand,will be launched in the European Union (EU).

 The brand is present in Canada, Austria, Australia, Switzerland and the UK. The company recently entered Germany.

 We will now focus our attention on the European Union, said Ravi Naware, CEO, ITC Foods Division.

 The company claims that Bingo, its snacks food brand, has grabbed a market share of 16 per cent in less than six months and it hopes to nudge that up to 50 per cent in a year. Metros such as Mumbai and Delhi contribute 25 to 30 per cent to the snacks food market. I hope I can export it some day, Naware said.

 ITC has also tied up with Kishore Biyanis Future Group. Food products contribute 62 per cent to new FMCG products with brands such as Sunfeast, Kitchens of India, Aashirvaad and Mint-. 

 ITC has emerged as the third largest player in the Rs 4,500-crore biscuit industry and is a market leader in branded atta. We are constantly looking at new products and will do so in the near future too, he added.

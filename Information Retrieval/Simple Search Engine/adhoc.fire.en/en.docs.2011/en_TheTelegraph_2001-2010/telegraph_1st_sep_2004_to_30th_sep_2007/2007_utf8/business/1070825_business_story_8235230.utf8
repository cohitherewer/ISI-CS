 Windfall for MTNL

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 24: Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) will be receiving Rs 1,100 crore from the income tax department as refund.

 MTNL chairman R. S. P. Sinha said the company had won a case against the department in the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and would get a refund of Rs 1,100 crore, including a penalty amount of Rs 850 crore and Rs 150 crore as interest. The interest will be factored in the profit-and-loss account over the remaining three quarters. The penalty amount of Rs 850 crore will be an asset-liability figure and will go to contingent liability.

 Over the last four to six months, MTNL had won a series of cases in the tribunal regarding expenditure that the income tax department had disallowed. 

 These refunds add up to Rs 2,000 crore. A senior MTNL official said the PSU could expect more refunds this year, including an immediate refund of Rs 650 crore for 2001-02 and 2002-03. 

 Flush with funds, the PSU is gearing up for acquisitions. MTNL, which offers services in Delhi and Mumbai, is evaluating options to bid for a 51 per cent stake in Telkom Kenya. The Kenyan government will examine all bids between October 30 and November 6. Telkom Kenya is the incumbent fixed line operator. 

 MTNL today became the first telecom firm in the country to offer Internet telephony or voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) to its customers in Delhi and Mumbai. 

 Subscribers who do not have a computer at home can make cheap ISD calls through VoIP for as low as Re 1 per minute through their fixed line phones. For those who choose to access MTNLs Internet telephony through their personal computers (a PC to PC call), the tariff will be as low as 10 paise per minute.

 MTNL has tied up with Aksh Optifibre to offer the VoIP service. So far, no telecom company has ventured into Internet telephony as they fear this will eat into their revenues from traditional mobile and fixed line calls.

 MTNLs move is set to change the market dynamics and force other operators to follow suit.

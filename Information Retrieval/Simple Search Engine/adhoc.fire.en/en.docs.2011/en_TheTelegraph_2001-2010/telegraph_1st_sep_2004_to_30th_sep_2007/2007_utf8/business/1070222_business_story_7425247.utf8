 Shop heads of Bata move court

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Feb. 21: All India Bata Shop Managers Union, affiliated to AITUC, has filed a case with Calcutta High Court on Wednesday seeking a stay on the managements decision to terminate the services of 11 shop managers and suspend 140 shop employees in Bengal.

 The matter will be formally moved in a couple of days. 

 The management had decided on February 18 to terminate the services of 11 shop managers and suspend 140 shop employees alleging that they were not complying with the regulations of keeping the stores open seven days a week and for longer hours.

 Bata India backed its decision in a statement, saying it took the extreme step on account of continued non-cooperation to keep the shops open for the desired time, according to the permission given by the state government and West Bengal Shops and Establishment Act. 

 For the past six months, the company has been asking the shop managers and employees to comply with the market realities with the assurance that they would work on rotational shift basis, get their one and half days leave every week and work for only 48 hours in a week.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 HLL fails to whip up the lather

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 30: Hindustan Lever today disappointed the Street with a net profit that fell way below expectations. Profit after tax (before exceptional items) rose 16 per cent to Rs 333.86 crore in the quarter ended March 31 compared with Rs 293.98 crore in the same period last year. 

 Analysts were looking forward to a profit after tax of at least Rs 345 crore and felt the rising input costs could have contributed to the disappointing performance. 

 The company has reported a 13.8 per cent growth in its topline. Net sales for the quarter grew to Rs 3,184.32 crore from Rs 2,798.05 crore in the same period last year. 

 HLL said the home and personal care business grew 10 per cent, backed by double-digit growth in the laundry and shampoo categories. While in the laundry segment, Surf and Wheel grew well, all brands in the shampoo category registered good growth. Fair and Lovely led this quarters growth in skin care products. 

 The foods business grew 23 per cent. In beverages, the entire range of Brooke Bond tea performed well. 

 The ice cream business grew over 20 per cent. 

 However, HLL said the business continued to face rising costs during the quarter, though aggressive cost saving initiatives partly mitigated the impact. 

 Chairman Harish Manwani said: The year started well with all our FMCG categories doing well. We have sustained the growth momentum in the key competitive categories of laundry and shampoos. All the food categories have performed strongly. The all-round growth has been driven by our strengthened competitiveness in the urban areas and sustained market development in villages.

 He, however, added that inflationary pressure is a matter of concern. HLL plans to continue with aggressive cost effectiveness programmes, manage judicious price increases and go for an improved portfolio mix. 

 We will continue to leverage our focussed portfolio of powerful brands to strengthen leadership in our core categories, Manwani added. 

 During the period, HLLs advertising costs increased 17.5 per cent as it continued to invest in brand promotion. Apart from this element, the quarters results also included costs and investments associated with scaling up of the water business.

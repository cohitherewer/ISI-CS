 Rising rupee hits textile exporters

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 10: The textile industry fears a revenue loss of as much as 15-20 per cent because of the rising rupee.

 Though the rupee has lost some of its gains last week, exporters said the damage has already been done. According to the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (Texprocil), the steep rise in the rupee has lowered textile and clothing exports to the US by almost 1.5 per cent to $1.86 billion during the January-April period compared with $1.89 billion during the same period last year.

 While we used to register exports growth of about 18 per cent in the past, the continuous appreciation of the rupee is going to hit our profitability in a big way. It is now a question of our survival, said Amit Ruparelia, vice-chairman, Texprocil.

 Though textile and clothing exports to the US from the rest of the world have come down in value terms during the first four months of this year, it is up by 7.85 per cent in volume terms. China accounted for close to 40 per cent of the exports to the US in value terms and 20.11 per cent in volume terms.

 Sources said the rupee has appreciated the most among its rival currencies. While the Chinese yuan appreciated by almost 5.01 per cent and the Indonesian Rupiah saw a rise by almost 5.75 per cent, the rupee appreciated against the dollar by 12.89 per cent in the past year. The industry is also fearing job losses in the sector. Although it is difficult to put exact figures on the attrition rate, close to 7-8 per cent of labourers in the industry have already given up their jobs, an official from Texprocil said. He added that the impact was particularly severe on small and medium producers of fabrics who supplied to readymade garment units. Many such units have been forced to cut production as garment exports have also declined.

 Once a market is lost to a competing supplier in another country, it is extremely difficult to regain confidence and renew contacts, sources added.

 WTO against sops

 The WTO has asked India to take a relook at the duty neutralisation sops given to the exporting community. WTO, while carrying out the trade policy review of India, found that the countrys export regime was highly complex and needed reforms.

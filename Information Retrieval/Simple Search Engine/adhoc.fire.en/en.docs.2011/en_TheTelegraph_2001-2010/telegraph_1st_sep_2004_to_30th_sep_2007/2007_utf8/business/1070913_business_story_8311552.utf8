 Industry growth slips

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 12: The growth in the index of industrial production slowed sharply to 7.1 per cent in July from 13.2 per cent a year ago.

 Economists attributed this to Reserve Banks tough monetary measures that pushed up interest rates. 

 As a result, there was a brake on consumer purchases and investments.

 Notwithstanding weak industry show, the gross domestic product is expected to grow by 9 per cent this fiscal on the back of a good monsoon and a booming service sector.

 In 2006-07, the growth in the gross domestic product was at an 18-year high of 9.4 per cent.

 During this period, the industrial index rose 11.3 per cent, the highest in 11 years.

 I am sure the overall growth rate of the economy in this (financial) year will still be about 9 per cent, C. Rangarajan, who heads the Prime Ministers economic advisory council, said in Mumbai.

 The Reserve Bank of India expects the growth to be a tad slower at 8.5 per cent.

 Top North Block officials said the government was not averse to a fall in the growth rate as checking inflation, which at one time crossed 6.5 per cent this fiscal, was a greater priority.

 With the political cost of rising prices evident in lost state assembly elections (for the Congress) there was little chance of not focussing on inflation, the officials said.

 More cash in the hands of consumers along with the huge inflow of dollars have pushed up prices.

 The situation got aggravated by infrastructure constraints in power, ports, roads and mines and a shortage of essential commodities such as cement.

 The industry slowdown showed up across all segments.

 Manufacturing output in July grew 7.2 per cent, down from 14.3 per cent a year earlier.

 Besides tough monetary controls, a rise in the value of the rupee, which reined in exports, also hit industry

 The central banks success in containing inflation also means that growth is getting impacted. Since economic management is now all about a tightrope walk between fast growth and economic overheating, the RBI has to now start thinking whether it should signal a rate cut to banks, the officials said. 

 Stock markets today reacted to the latest series of numbers. After early gains, the sensex ceded ground to close 0.2 per cent lower at 15505 points.

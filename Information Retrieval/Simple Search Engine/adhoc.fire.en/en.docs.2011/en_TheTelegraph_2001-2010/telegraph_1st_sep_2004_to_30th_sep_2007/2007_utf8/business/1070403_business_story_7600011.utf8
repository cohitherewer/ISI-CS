 PowerGrid issue this month

 OUR BUREAU 

New Delhi, April 2: State-owned Power Grid Corporation expects to tap the market with its initial public offering (IPO) in April. Its merchant bankers are doing the final vetting of the proposal to enter the capital market with 10 per cent fresh equity even as the transmission monopoly is negotiating a $2-billion loan from multilateral agencies to fund its network expansion and higher capital expenditure.

 We will come out with the IPO within this month, a senior PowerGrid official said. 

 He said the proceeds would be used to fund expansion but declined to comment on the companys expectations from the issue or the likely price band. 

 PowerGrid earlier planned to spend Rs 6,500 crore in 2007-08, but actual spending could be around Rs 9,100 crore. We are trying to increase the capex for 2007-08 to Rs 9,100 crore, the official said. 

 PowerGrid has started negotiations to raise loans from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. The loans will be for $1 billion each with a 20-year term. Details are expected to be worked out over the next six to 12 months. The loans will be used to fund grid-laying requirements and various other projects. 

 BEML offer

 Bharat Earth Movers Ltd plans to raise Rs 440 crore through a public issue in June, as the company continues to eye new business opportunities to fuel growth, senior officials said today.

 BEML chairman and managing director V.R.S. Natarajan said the issue proceeds would be used to fund expansion, diversification and modernisation plans, and also offer voluntary retirement scheme for around 1,000-1,200 employees.

 We hope to hit the market in the first half of June. We are planning to raise Rs 440 crore by issuing 49 lakh shares, he said. I dont expect erosion of EPS (earnings per share), Natarajan said in response to a question.

 BEML, which is mainly in the business of mining and construction, railway and metro and defence services, today reported provisional earnings for the financial year 2006-07. The turnover stands at Rs 2,600 crore for 2006-07, up 18 per cent from that in the previous fiscal. 

 Profit before tax rose to Rs 315 crore, up 10 per cent, he added.

 It has an orderbook of Rs 1,670 crore at the beginning of this fiscal, which is likely to swell to Rs 2,700 crore as it expects orders of Rs 1,030 crore in a month, Natarajan said.

 The company is targeting a turnover of Rs 3,200 crore in 2007-08.

 Govt mulls changes in Mauritius tax treaty

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

New Delhi, Feb. 22: The government is considering changes in the double taxation avoidance treaty with Mauritius, which has made the island nation the source of the majority of investments to India.

 India and Mauritius are currently working on a comprehensive economic cooperation and partnership agreement which will allow duty-free rum from the African state, free flow of services from India and govern investment flows.

 The two sides are also looking afresh at the double taxation avoidance treaty, which has been attacked by Indias security agencies and debated on the floor of Parliament.

 The National Security Adviser is believed to have suggested curbs on unverifiable investment from tax havens like Mauritius. The US government is also keen on keeping a check on possible drug money being siphoned into legitimate businesses.

 Revenue officials said new checks are being contemplated, which would verify the actual source of the money, without scaring off investments. FDI from Mauritius was $4.01 billion during the April- November period, which works out to 55.5 per cent of the $7.23 billion FDI inflow during this period.

 After the stock market meltdown in May last year, Left leaders had demanded a renegotiation of the Mauritius tax treaty. They wanted to prevent its misuse in routing hot money into the Indian capital market.

 Mauritius is willing to check misuse of the treaty but is reluctant to insert provisions that will put off investors, say officials. 

 A joint parliamentary committee probing an earlier stock scam had come out with evidence of rogue overseas corporate bodies involved in stock exchange frauds operating out of the island tax haven. These OCBs were suspected of being fronts for promoters of Indian companies, indicted for circular trading to rig prices of certain specific shares by artificially pushing them up or down.

 Officials also said India loses about Rs 2,000 crore annually because many multinationals route their investments through Mauritius taking advantage of its tax haven status.

 This kind of treaty shopping is normal business practice but hurts our revenue collection efforts ... maybe some small checks to absolutely blatant treaty shopping may also be worked in, said officials.

 The Indo-Mauritius tax avoidance treaty was signed in 1983.

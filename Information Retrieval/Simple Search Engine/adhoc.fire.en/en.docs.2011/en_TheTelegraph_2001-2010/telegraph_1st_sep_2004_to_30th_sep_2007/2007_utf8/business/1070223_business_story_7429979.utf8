 Kotak fund to tap emerging market

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 22: Kotak Asset Management Company today joined hands with US-based T Rowe Price to launch a fund that would invest in the T Rowe Price Funds-Global Emerging Markets Equity Fund.

 Kotak AMC CEO Sandesh Kirkire said the fund is likely to be launched in the next couple of months.

 According to Uday Kotak, executive vice-chairman and managing director of Kotak Mahindra Bank, the fund will provide Indian investors an opportunity to increase returns and diversify their portfolio.

 Kirkire said the mutual fund house would file a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in the next couple of weeks. The minimum investment for an Indian investor in the fund will be Rs 5,000.

 While the Reserve Bank of India earlier allowed Indian investors to invest in overseas companies, current regulations cap mutual funds investment in global assets at $150 million.

 The new fund will aim to outperform the MSCI emerging markets index over the medium to long-term by investing in the T Rowe Price fund.

 The Global Emerging Markets Equity Fund invests in a widely diversified global portfolio of equity and equity-related securities of companies that are either based in or have a large part of their business in emerging countries of Latin America, Asia, Europe, and Africa.

 T Rowe Price, founded in 1937, is a global investment management firm based in Baltimore, US. On December 31, 2006, the group managed $334.7 billion for investors worldwide. 

 Todd Ruppert, president amp; CEO of T Rowe Price Global Investment Services, said though the Indian capital markets have performed well in recent times, the performance of some other markets have been better.

 Holcim ups ACC stake

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 8: Holcim today raised its stake in Associated Cement Companies by over 3 per cent to 41 per cent. 

 The worlds second-largest cement maker bought nearly 60 lakh ACC shares for Rs 540 crore through a block deal on the bourses. Holcim paid Rs 900 apiece for the shares. 

 The shares were purchased from various investors in multiple deals, which were brokered by Enam. 

 ACC was one of the few scrips that closed with a gain on the Bombay Stock Exchange today. On a day when the benchmark index fell 114 points, the ACC share ended up 2.68 per cent or Rs 23.15 at Rs 885.55. 

 The purchase price of Rs 900 per share is more than double of what Holcim offered to ACC shareholders when it came out with an open offer of Rs 370 per share in 2005. 

 Holcim has been raising its stake in Indian companies in the recent past. The company recently acquired over 2.79 crore GACL shares worth Rs 321.55 crore in a block deal on the BSE. It now holds over 30 per cent in GACL. The shares were acquired by Holderind Investments, a holding company of Holcim. 

 In November last year, Holcim acquired five crore shares or 3.7 per cent from entities controlled by GACLs founder promoters. 

 These shares were acquired by Holderind Investmente from RKBK Fiscal Services and Radha Madhav Investments. RKBKs 1.65 crore shares and Radha Madhavs 3.35 crore shares were bought for Rs 137 apiece. Holcim paid Rs 685 crore for the transaction.

 The deal price was 32 per cent higher than the Rs 105 per share that Holcim paid the Sekhsarias and Neotias when it bought 14.8 per cent in GACL in early 2006. 

 With Holcim raising its stake in both ACC and GACL over the past few months, there has been speculation that ACC and GACL could be merged at a later date. A merger possibility was, however, denied by the ACC management.

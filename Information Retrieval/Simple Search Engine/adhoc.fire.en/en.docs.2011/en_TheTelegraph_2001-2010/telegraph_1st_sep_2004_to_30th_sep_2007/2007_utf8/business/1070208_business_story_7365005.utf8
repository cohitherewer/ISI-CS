 Industry to face hurdles

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: The unprecedented boom in the manufacturing sector, rising incomes of consumers and easy availability of loans have become part of Indias growth lore. 

 But the big question is of sustainability. 

 The manufacturing sector is expected to grow at 11.3 per cent this financial year after having grown at a decade high rate of 14.4 per cent during November 2006. Will this boom continue? 

 The high rates are likely to be maintained as there is still plenty of steam in the services sector, while the huge investments in agriculture are expected to impart a greater fizz on rural growth. But the double-digit growth in industry, which is behind the good times, may perhaps taper down.

 With the RBI getting tightfisted, money will not be easily available to fuel a renewed bout of spending in consumer goods and a huge expansion in production capacities. 

 Economists do not expect a decline in consumer spending and investments in capital goods but they do see a cooling down of consumer spending brought about by higher personal loans and loans on credit cards.

 The higher rate on loans to the industry and real estate will also mean a cooling down of both the prices of manufactured items as well as the desire to invest immediately to take advantage of the rising uptrend in prices. 

 At the same time, the global business cycle, according to World Bank estimates, is on the downswing. With India integrating more and more with the world economy, the impact of this downswing can be expected to hit the country. When there is a global slowdown, exports from India take a beating. India is heavily reliant on export-led growth in certain sectors such as textiles and software and a global deceleration could reduce the growth impetus.

 The Institute of Economic Growth sees industrial growth to be between 8-9.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of this fiscal and says in a report that we have been saying for some time there could be a slowdown in industrial growth any time.

 Vinay Cements to buy out group firm

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 6: The board of Vinay Cements Limited, part of the Assam-based BK Group, has decided to acquire all equities of its group company RCL Cements Ltd.

 The boards of the two companies, which met here today, have approved a share-swap ratio under which 2.45 Vinay Cements shares will be given for every share of RCL Cements. The share price of Vinay Cements was fixed at Rs 35 and that of RCL at Rs 85.75 apiece. PricewaterhouseCoopers has done the valuations of the companies.

 RCL Cements is an unlisted company and is wholly owned by the promoters. 

 The acquisition is expected to help Vinay Cements consolidate its competitive edge in the Northeast. 

 Both the cement companies share synergies of a common dealer network and the proposed acquisition will benefit Vinay Cement not only in terms of increased revenue but also by saving in distribution cost.

 The merger will also help Vinay Cements expand its capacity to 0.50 million tonnes.

 North Cachar-based Vinay Cement has also proposed to set up a manufacturing unit for calcined clay, a substitute of fly ash, resulting in substantial savings to the company. Both Vinay Cements and RCL Cements has shares in Calcom Cement India, the new plant being set up with a capacity of 1.40 million tonnes in North Cachar Hills district of Assam. Last year, the BK Group decided to set up a greenfield cement project at Cachar with an investment of Rs 414 crore.

 Assam Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) holds a 10 per cent stake in Calcom Cement.

 Montek bid to touch core of US heart

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahluwalia: Hopeful

 New Delhi, March 6: In an attempt to woo US investors, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia today said the infrastructure sector provides a $350-billion opportunity.

 The investments required over the next five years are essential to sustain the current levels of high economic growth.

 Ahluwalia said most of the investment to develop the nations roads, ports and airports should be in the form of FDI and should come through private sector participation. 

 He was addressing the inaugural session of the annual Indo-US conference organised by the Confederation of India Industry (CII) in collaboration with the US India Business Council (USIBC).

 Investments in Indias infrastructure should be about 8 per cent of the GDP, amounting to $18-20 billion per annum, said Ahluwalia. 

 When asked about overseas investments, he said there is no reason for the global investor community to fear given Indias past achievements. 

 The economy is doing well. We had an average growth of 8.3 per cent in the past four years and 9.2 per cent during the past two years. We hope to achieve a growth rate of 10 per cent by the end of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, said Ahluwalia, who was addressing prospective US investors. 

 He also said the governments efforts on inclusive growth should not be perceived as a dilution of the existing growth agenda.

 Inclusive growth should not mean that existing growth agenda was being diluted, said Ahluwalia. 

 Stating that the benefits of economic growth should percolate to all sections of society, Ahluwalia said the recent budget announcements clearly indicated the governments intention to ensure overall growth.

 Agriculture, along with development of infrastructure, will continue to remain the governments focus. There is a need to restructure Indian agricultural research to provide definite progress in the agricultural sector, said Ahluwalia. Only this will help the sector grow by 4 per cent from the existing 2.3 per cent. 

 The education cess was a necessary step towards upgrading the system to ensure skill upgradation to meet the demands of a growing economy, he added. 

 Meanwhile, CII had recently presented a report on infrastructure development to Ahluwalia. The industry has been advised by him to build a broader consensus on the matter.

 The report, prepared jointly with Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility, calls for an overarching regulatory framework for infrastructure, and suggests principles to enhance the efficacy of regulatory mechanism for infrastructure.

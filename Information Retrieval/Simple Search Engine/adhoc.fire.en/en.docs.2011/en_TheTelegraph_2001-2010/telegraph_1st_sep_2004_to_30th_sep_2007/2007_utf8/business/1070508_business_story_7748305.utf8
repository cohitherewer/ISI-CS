 Fixed-line users on the rise

New Delhi, May 7 (PTI): Fixed-line telephones have regained much of their charm, thanks to the value-added services that are now bundled with new connections.

 The trend of surrendering the phones, which started in 2004, has been reversed. Two main initiatives broadband and IPTV have helped us retain customers, Kuldip Singh, MTNL director (technical), said.

 The company has more than 37 lakh fixed-line subscribers in Delhi and Mumbai. So far, about 5 lakh subscribers have left MTNLs fixed-line services as they switched to mobile phones. While some of them took MTNLs mobile connection, others opted for private mobile services.

 Because of broadband, lot of customers are coming back and IPTV (cable services) would further improve the situation, Singh said. MTNL would soon announce convergent billing for all services like fixed-line phone, mobile, broadband and IPTV, he added. Asked if the company was planning to offer a bouquet of services by bundling all services into one for a fixed amount of charges, Singh said, All such schemes are in the offing.

 In Delhi, there has been a net addition of fixed-line connections for couple of months while in Mumbai it was marginally in the negative, Singh said. The fault rate, which had risen to as high as 25 per cent, has been brought down to a single-digit level. The company is expected to achieve a zero per cent fault rate soon.

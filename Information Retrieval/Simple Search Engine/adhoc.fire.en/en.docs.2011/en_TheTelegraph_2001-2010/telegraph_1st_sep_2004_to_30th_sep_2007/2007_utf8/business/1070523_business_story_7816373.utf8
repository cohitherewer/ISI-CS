 Azerbaijan field on ONGC radar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 22: ONGC Videsh is eyeing Caspian Energy Groups stake in an oilfield in Azerbaijan. The stake is worth $300 million .

 The overseas subsidiary of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation is bidding for Caspian Energys 51 per cent holding in Shivran Oil Operating Company which operates the Kyurovdag oilfield in Azerbaijan. 

 The remaining 49 per cent in Shivran is with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan.

 If ONGC Videsh acquires the stake, it will be the companys maiden entry into the energy-rich Central Asian country. The company is present in 14 countries, including Myanmar, Vietnam, Russia, Egypt, Sudan and Australia.

 It expects production to touch 20 million tonnes a year by 2010, with the focus regions being Central Asia, Latin America and Africa.

 ONGC Videsh chairman R.S. Sharma said as part of the plans to focus on specific regions, the company has acquired a 15 per cent stake in the BC-10 deepwater block in Brazil, which can produce 90,000 barrels daily. It has also acquired two offshore blocks in Nigeria. 

 Investments for the Eleventh Five Year Plan, which runs till 2012, have been fixed at Rs 50,000 crore compared with Rs 15,300 crore in the Tenth Five Year Plan.

 ONGC Videsh gets 6.3mt of oil and oil equivalent of gas from its overseas assets. It earned a net profit of Rs 981 crore in 2005-06. 

 The company is now focussing more on Central Asian countries such as Azerbaijan and less on Russia. This is because the assets in Russia have become expensive following the spike in the price of crude. 

 ONGC Videsh had expected to acquire more assets in Russia after the success of its operations in the Sakhalin Islands which is off the eastern coast of Russia.

 The company had bagged the Sakhalin deal when low crude prices had weakened the bargaining power of the Russians.

 Now, with the rising prices, Russia has prepaid the $1.3 billion borrowed from ONGC Videsh at the time of the Sakhalin deal.

 Calcutta, Aug. 31: Exim Bank has received several proposals from domestic small and medium enterprises (SMEs) either for acquisition or setting up joint ventures abroad. 

 The apex bank for export-import financing will invest in equities in some of these projects, Exim Bank executive director S. R. Rao said here today. 

 Of course, the SME projects that we would invest in should have a sound track record and export potential, Rao said on the sidelines of an interactive session with the members of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations here today.

 The bank is also open to the idea of investing in select start-up and expansion projects in the country. 

 Exim Bank has decided to double its overseas investments in foreign joint ventures and subsidiaries of Indian companies during the current financial year. The bank has earmarked $500 million for this in 2007-08 against $250 million in 2006-07.

 The proposals that Exim Bank has received are in areas of pharmaceuticals, engineering and oil drilling. 

 The bank invests up to 25 per cent in equities if it is a joint venture and 49 per cent if it is a wholly owned subsidiary of an Indian company. The bank doesnt invest more than $5 million in one particular company. In takeovers, the bank generally does not consider those proposals where the aggregate value of acquisition is more than $150 million. 

 The bank plans to raise Rs 15,000 crore during the current financial year to extend credits and invest overseas. 

 It has already raised Rs 2,500 crore and has tied up with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation for a $100-million loan. Exim Bank is now negotiating with the Asian Development Bank for a $250-million loan for funding small and medium companies only. 

 We also need to raise the entire $1 billion that we propose to extend as lines of credit this year, Rao said.

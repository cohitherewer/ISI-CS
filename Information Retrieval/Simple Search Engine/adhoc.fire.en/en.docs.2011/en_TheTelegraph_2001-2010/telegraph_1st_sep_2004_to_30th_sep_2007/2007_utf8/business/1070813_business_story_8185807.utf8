The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Good show by sectoral schemes 

 sectoral schemes of mutual funds have come up with much superior returns compared with plain vanilla diversified equity plans. 

 Banking sector funds led the pack in terms of one-year average returns (60.18 per cent) between August 2006 and July this year, followed by the technology sector funds (38.40 per cent) and equity-linked saving schemes (37.82 per cent). Compared with these, diversified equity funds yielded only 36.98 per cent. 

 Diversified mutual funds could not even beat the BSEs 30-share sensitive index that gave a 44.74 per cent return during the same period. 

 Even the technology sector funds, despite the fact that IT companies were hard hit by 13 per cent appreciation in the rupee vis--vis the dollar, outperformed diversified equity funds.

 During the August-July period, the BSE Bankex, the share price index of banking stocks, gave a 70.75 per cent return, excluding the dividend payouts. 

 BSE sensex and BSE Bankex outperformed the returns in diversified equity schemes and banking sector funds, respectively, by handsome margins. The high rate of investment churn and high attrition of fund managers may have lead to this. 

 However, the BSE IT index during the period gave a return of 23.3 per cent, while technology sector funds gave an average return of 38.40 per cent. A number of information technology companies went in for a stock split and announced bonus shares during the period. 

 Over the last 12 months, top 10 schemes that gave the highest return during the period were not from banking or information technology sectors. These schemes had investments in services sector companies, construction, engineering and technology firms.

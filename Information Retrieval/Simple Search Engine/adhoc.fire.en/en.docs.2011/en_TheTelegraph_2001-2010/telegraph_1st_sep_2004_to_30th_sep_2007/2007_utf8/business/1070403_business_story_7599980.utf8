 Haldia Petro pledges a cleaner tomorrow

 Bhowmik: Future plans

 Haldia, April 2: Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL) has developed a special grade of petrol that will help attain stricter fuel emission norms based on cleaner fuel.

 HPL, which provides a high volume of Euro III petrol in Calcutta, has developed the Euro IV grade.

 The company is one of the few petrochemical units to produce petrol. Generally, petrol is produced by refineries from crude oil. HPL produces it from naphtha. 

 We have developed Euro IV petrol and are ready to sell when there is demand, said Swapan Bhowmik, managing director of HPL.

 Euro IV norms will be implemented in Calcutta from 2008 along with 11 other cities. These norms will come into effect in the rest of the country from 2010. Bhowmik also announced today the best ever performance of the company in terms of profit and sales.

 HPL has posted sales of Rs 8,300 crore and profit worth Rs 584 crore in 2006-07.

 The company produces about 18-20,000 tonnes of Euro III grade petrol.

 It sells the product to both private and public sector oil marketing companies like Bharat Petroleum and Essar. The company earns a sizeable amount by selling the product. 

 According to an estimate, it makes on an average Rs 30,000 a tonne or about Rs 720 crore a year. HPL expects to increase the production in future. 

 Our production will go up another 28-30 per cent soon, Subir Ranjan Ghosh, head of plants and projects of HPL, said. The companys entire production capacity will increase by 30 per cent after a revamp by the end of this financial year. 

 Government regulation does not allow the company to market the product directly. Since the price is regulated, the company does not make a very high margin out of it. Still, its Euro III petrol is well accepted in the eastern market and there is a huge demand for it.

 Bhowmik said the company planned to go into high margin products in the future.

 We are working on several models to implement it. We hope to reach a decision by the end of 2007 and take it to the board for approval, Bhowmik added.

 New Delhi, Feb. 12: Toyota Motor Corporation plans to invest Rs 1,890 crore to set up its second plant in south India to manufacture small cars.

 A report quoting Japans Nikkei business daily said the new plant Toyotas second manufacturing facility in India would be set up in Bangalore with an initial production capacity of 1 lakh cars a year. Toyota Kirloskar Motors, in which Toyota holds an 89 per cent stake and the Kirloskars 11 per cent, already has a plant in Bangalore.

 Toyota Kirloskar deputy managing director K.K. Swamy told The Telegraph, I can neither confirm nor deny the news. Plans for the second car plant are currently under study. We cannot say when the plant will be operational since the company policy is not to comment on any future projections. It is too early to say.

 On whether Toyota Kirloskar has heard from the parent company on this issue, he said, We have not received any official communication in this regard from our headquarters.

 Toyota has set a target to capture up to 10 per cent of the Indian car market by 2010. The company has already expressed its willingness to be present in the burgeoning small car market.

 All car manufacturers in the country want to garner a significant market share in the next three years at a time when annual sales are expected to nearly double to 2 million units or even more.

 The foreign news report also said the small car that will be rolled out from the proposed new plant would be priced at about 8,00,000 yen (approximately Rs 2.88 lakh).

 Toyotas first Indian plant became operational in 1999. At present, Toyota Kirloskar sells sedans like the Corolla and the Camry, seven-seater multi-purpose vehicle Innova and the Prado sport utility vehicle. 

 The company, which sold 48,000 vehicles in India in 2006, has phased out its once popular Qualis.

 Meanwhile, Japanese car maker Suzukis Indian joint venture Maruti Udyog will invest an additional Rs 10,800 crore by 2010 to expand capacity at car and engine plants. Honda is also building a second plant in Rajasthan and aims to sell more than 1.5 lakh vehicles a year by the end of 2010.

 Local banks mere spectators

 MISS OUT ON ACTION

 Indian banks are not in the global big league. The big banks do the deals 

 Only 22 Indian banks are 

in the top 1,000, while SBI is the sole bank in Asias top-25

 Loan exposure norms of RBI restrict such deals. The rules 

allow a bank to lend up to 

15 per cent of its capital funds 

to a single borrower and 40 per cent to a group

Mumbai, Dec. 31: Indian companies are generating the buzz in global mergers and acquisitions, yet local banks are far away from the action. They are nearly anonymous as talks of multi-billion-dollar deals fly thick and fast in the race for Corus between Tata Steel and Brazils CSN and the stake of Hutchison Telecom International in Hutchison Essar.

 Despite expanding fast in India and abroad, local banks have not participated in acquisition financing, particularly those involving huge funds, or been financial advisers in major transactions. Foreign banks, however, are cornering the bulk of these deals. 

 This is a reality which the Indian banks have to face now. As companies go global and the ticket size of deals increases, foreign banks will play a greater role, a banker said. 

 Sources cite many reasons for this trend. Firstly, Indian banks even leading bank State Bank of India are relatively small globally. There are only around 22 Indian banks in the top 1,000 banks of the world, while only SBI makes the list of the top 25 banks in Asia, though its size is very small compared with the fourth largest bank of China.

 Moreover, exposure norms of the RBI limit banks involvement in such huge deals. 

 One must also remember that these foreign banks have relationships with companies abroad. Therefore, these companies will take their assistance when they have to invest into India. On the other hand, though Indian banks have gone abroad, their scale is much smaller, adds another banker.

 Take the Tata Steel offer for Corus. The first bid for the UK company was at 455 pence, funded by cash and loan arrangements made solely by foreign banks. 

 Standard Chartered offered subordinated debt financing of 196 million to Tata Steel UK. The balance was in the form of senior, mezzanine bridge and working capital loan facilities worth 3.3 billion, jointly arranged and fully underwritten by Credit Suisse, ABN Amro and Deutsche Bank.

 Indian banks were also missing from action in Hutchison Telecom Internationals plans to sell its stake in Hutchison Essar. Banks reportedly in the deal are Citigroup, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, UBS and Morgan Stanley.

 K.Unnikrishnan, senior vice-president, Indian Banks Association (IBA), said exposure norms play a key role. 

 RBI rules allow a bank to lend up to 15 per cent of its capital funds to a single borrower and 40 per cent to a group. 

 Since banks lend to corporates, there will be a limit on additional lending due to the exposure norms.

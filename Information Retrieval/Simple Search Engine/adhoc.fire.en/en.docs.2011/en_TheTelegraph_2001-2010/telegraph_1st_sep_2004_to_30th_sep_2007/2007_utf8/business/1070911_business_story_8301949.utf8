 Natural gas price issue flares up

 New Delhi, Sept. 10 (PTI): An empowered group of ministers will meet tomorrow to discuss Reliances gas pricing issue in the backdrop of a heated debate between the Ambani brothers.

 Anil Ambanis Reliance Energy today accused elder brother Mukesh-led Reliance Industries of holding power and fertiliser sectors to ransom by demanding artificially inflated price for natural gas.

 It was reacting to reports that RIL had warned of cartelisation in case it was asked to invite fresh bids for selling gas.

 REL director J.P. Chalasani said, It is shocking that RIL, a private sector monopoly producer of gas, is raising the bogey of cartelisation, to prevent a transparent rebidding process.

 Chalasani said in a statement that RILs arrogance was now transgressing all limits, as it trashed the findings of a committee of secretaries and the Prime Ministers economic advisory council, which advocated a fresh and transparent rebidding process.

 RIL is holding the growth of the power and fertilisers sectors to ransom, by demanding artificially inflated pricing for gas, owing to its monopoly producer status, Chalasani said.

 The reaction came after RIL president and CEO (petroleum) P.M.S. Prasad wrote to petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan, saying a fresh bidding process for price discovery would distort the market and lead to cartelisation as bidding would be now done under a pre-conceived allocation mechanism.

 The bidding process followed by RIL (that discovered the price of $4.33 per million british thermal unit for KG-D6 gas) was a transparent and legally complete process in line with the provisions of the production sharing contract, Prasad had said.

 In case the government does declare a policy on allocation for certain sectors or companies, it would lead to cartelisation by parties and not constitute a process of arms length price discovery in as much as the price that the favoured allottees of gas would be willing to pay would never be reflective of true market price of gas, he said.

 More trouble for tech firms

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 20: The rising rupee spells more trouble for technology titans.

 The rising rupee has lopped profits off the balancesheets of TCS, Infosys and Wipro every quarter in the past year. With the rupee tumbling below 40, there are indications that the IT pack will again report crimped profits in the second quarter.

 There are two types of revenues for IT companies, said Harshad Deshpande, analyst at Religare Securities. One from onsite operations, where the companies earn in dollars and pay wages in dollars. Here, there will be no effect. But for offshore revenues, where companies earn in dollars but pay in rupees, the revenues will be affected. 

 During the last quarter ended June 30, infotech firms had to contend with a rupee that had surged some 7 per cent. Companies such as Infosys had to sacrifice Rs 287 crore from their first-quarter profits. 

 Infosys is hit to the extent of 30 to 40 basis points as the rupee surges by every 1 per cent, Deshpande said. In July, Infosys had made its forecasts for the second quarter assuming the rupee would hold steady at 40.58. Infosys had forecast an income between Rs 3,952-3,993 crore for the second quarter, signalling a year-on-year growth of 14.5 to 15.7 per cent.

 The rupee today closed at 39.89 a 1.72 per cent fall from the peg that Infosys had assumed in its calculations. Most infotech companies buckled on the bourses today. 

 Hedging is not a long-term strategy and every time the rupee appreciates, operating margins are hit, said an IT analyst. Spokesmen for Wipro and Infosys refused to comment on the possible impact of the rising rupee on their second quarter profits.

 Orkut inspires Anil firm

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 13: The success of social networking websites like MySpace, Facebook and Orkut has started to spawn a couple of desi clones.

 After rediff.com, its the turn of Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Entertainment to enter the social networking space with its site called bigadda.com.

 One of the biggest draws for the social networking sites globally is the advertising spend. According to eMarketer, the advertising spend on social networking sites is expected to touch almost $900 million in the US in 2007, up from $350 million the year ago. It is believed that the figure will rise to $1,380 billion next year and top at $2.5 billion by 2011.

 The Indian story may not be that big as of now, but with 30 to 35 million Internet users, the social sites can only ring in revenues.

 We expect to grow to half a billion subscribers in the next three years, said Rajesh Sawhney, president of Reliance Entertainment, at the formal launch of bigadda.com here today.

 Crude record under threat

 London, July 6 (Reuters): Crude oil surged to 11-month highs above $75 a barrel on Friday, putting the market within the reach of the all-time record of $78.65 set in August 2006. 

 Abductions in Nigerias oil producing Niger Delta and increased demand from refiners in the US helped drive up the price. 

 London Brent crude, now seen as a better indicator of the global market, rose 25 cents to $75 a barrel, after touching a session high of $75.10, its highest since August 14, 2006. 

 US crude rose 12 cents to $71.93. 

 The end of a one-month truce by the rebel group responsible for much of the violence directed at the Nigerian oil industry, an attack on an oil rig and the kidnapping of a 3-year-old British girl in Port Harcourt reminded investors of the continued risk to supplies from the worlds eighth-largest oil exporter. 

 Concerns over whether US gasoline inventories could keep pace with robust demand lingered despite a higher-than-expected weekly stock rise of 1.8 million barrels reported by the US Energy Information Administration. 

 Stocks are below normal levels for this time of the year while gasoline demand is up 1.2 per cent from last year. 

 Gasoline supplies worldwide are also tightening. 

 Northwest European stock levels are down to a two-month low, exports from key Asian exporter China in July will drop to their lowest in 10 months and Japanese stocks dipped below year-ago levels for the first time this year.

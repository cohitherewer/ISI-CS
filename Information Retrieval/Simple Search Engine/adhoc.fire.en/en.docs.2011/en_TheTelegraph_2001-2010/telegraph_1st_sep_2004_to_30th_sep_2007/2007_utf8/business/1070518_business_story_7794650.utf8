 Mumbai, May 17: Tata Steel is looking to ramp up its capacity to 40 million tonnes a year by 2012 and climb to the second place behind Lakshmi Mittals Arcelor Mittal in the global pecking order.

 Arcelor Mittal is the largest steel producer with a capacity of over 118 million tonnes. Nippon Steel trails in second place with 32 million tonnes.

 After closing its deal to take over Corus in early February, Tata Steel is looking to raise capacity at home through three new plants and one expansion project this financial year. 

 The group has a capacity of 25 million tonnes at present, including Corus plants in the UK and Holland. 

 Tata Steel today reported a net profit of Rs 1,103.5 crore during the fourth quarter ended March 31 an increase of almost 41 per cent over last years Rs 783.11 crore but it fell short of a median forecast of Rs 1,184 crore made by 13 brokerages who were polled by Reuters.

 The company reported a total income of Rs 5,609.58 crore in the fourth quarter against Rs 4,602.48 crore in the year-ago period. It recommended a dividend of 130 per cent for the financial year and a special dividend of 25 per cent on the occasion of its centenary year. 

 The Tata Steel stock closed at Rs 597.35, up 1.51 per cent on the BSE today.

 Tata Steel is the countrys largest private steel company with standalone capacity of 5 million tonnes. We intend to increase the current capacity of the Jamshedpur unit by 1.8 million tonnes a year by June 2008, said managing director B. Muthuraman.

 The company has posted a net profit of Rs 4,222.15 crore for the full year ended March 31, which is about 20 per cent higher than Rs 3,506 crore in the previous year. On a consolidated basis, income from operations rose 18.82 per cent to Rs 27,437.29 crore against Rs 22,272.14 crore last year.

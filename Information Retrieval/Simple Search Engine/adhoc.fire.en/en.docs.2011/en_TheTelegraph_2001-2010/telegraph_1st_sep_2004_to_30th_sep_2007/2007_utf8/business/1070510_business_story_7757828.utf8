 New Delhi, May 9: The government is likely to raise around Rs 2,250-2,500 crore by selling its rump holding of 10.27 per cent in Maruti. 

 As many as 36 banks, financial institutions and mutual funds have come up with bids ranging between Rs 765 and Rs 850 a share for the rump stake. Bids were received for 3.59 crore shares against the 2.96 crore on offer.

 Sources said the bidders include the Life Insurance Corporation, the State Bank, Corporation Bank and the Union Bank of India. 

 The highest bid came from Corporation Bank at Rs 850 apiece for one crore shares, followed by LIC, sources said. 

 We hope to complete the sale by tomorrow, said an official. The bids were to be opened today, but was postponed till Thursday as the minister for heavy industries, Santosh Mohan Dev, whose ministry holds the stake, was away in Guwahati.

 Marutis share closed at Rs 802.85 on the BSE today, up 0.30 per cent from yesterdays close.

 The government had invited expressions of interest in February this year, but a decision was deferred because of the high volatility in the stock markets.

 The government wants a premium over the market price and had asked its advisers to set the price and timing of the stake sale accordingly, an official said. 

 SBI Capital Markets and Kotak Mahindra Capital are advising the government on the stake sale. 

 On January 12, 2006, the government sold an 8 per cent stake at a premium and earned Rs 1,567 crore. 

 The cabinet committee on economic affairs had given its nod to the sale of the government stake in December 2006.

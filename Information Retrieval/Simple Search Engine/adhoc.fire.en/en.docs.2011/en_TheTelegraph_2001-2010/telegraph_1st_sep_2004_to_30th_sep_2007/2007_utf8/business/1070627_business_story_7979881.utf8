 Saudi Tele enters India via Maxis buy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 26: Saudi Telecom, owned by the government of Saudi Arabia, will obtain an indirect stake of 18.5 per cent in Chennai-based Aircel Cellular after it picked up 25 per cent in Malaysias Maxis for little over $3 billion. Maxis has a 74 per cent holding in Aircel. 

 In Maxis, Saudi Telecom will pick up the stake by investing in tycoon Ananda Krishnans company Binariang, the largest shareholder of the Malaysian company.

 Apart from getting a hold in the booming Indian telecom market, Saudi Telecom will also obtain a 51 per cent stake in Maxiss Indonesian company Natrindo. 

 A statement issued by Mohammed al-Jasser, chairman of the state-owned company, said, This transaction represents an important step for the companys drive to become an influential player in the global telecom sector.

 Aircel operates in nine circles and the rest of the shares in the company (24 per cent) is with the Reddy family of the Apollo group. It had 6.4 million subscribers at the end of May, with a 5 per cent share of the Indian GSM market.

 Saudi Telecoms indirect stake in Aircel brings back memories of the Orascom saga that began in December 2005 when the Egyptian company picked up 19 per cent in Hutchison Telecommunications International Ltd (HTIL), thereby giving it a 10 per cent stake in Hutchison Essar. The controversial purchase sparked security worries in India even as the Essar group objected to Orascoms entry.

 Although Saudi Telecom will have to get an approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board for the indirect stake, analysts do not expect the company to face the difficulties that Orascom did. Observers here said while there were security worries related to Orascoms operations in Pakistan, these might not be triggered by Saudi Telecoms case.

 Saudi Arabia does not fall into the category of countries where the government has security concerns. Moreover, the Essar group, the partners in Hutch Essar, objected to Orascoms entry. This may not happen in the case of Saudi Telecom, sources said.

 Reports say Aircel is planning to establish a pan-India presence. It has licences for 23 circles in the country and the company has been allotted spectrum to roll out services in Calcutta. It had awarded a contract worth Rs 300 crore for the Calcutta circle to Nokia Siemens.

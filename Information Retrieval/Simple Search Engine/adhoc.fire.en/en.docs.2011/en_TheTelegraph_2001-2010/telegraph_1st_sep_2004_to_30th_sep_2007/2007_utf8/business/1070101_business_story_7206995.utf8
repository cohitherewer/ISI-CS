 Call rates to stay tight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 CRR effect

 Mumbai, Dec. 31: Inter-bank call money rates, which were at a six-year high of 19 per cent on Friday, are expected to stay firm over the next few days with liquidity remaining tight because of outflow as the second stage of the rise in cash reserve ratio (CRR) takes effect. A possible government securities auction that could suck out Rs 9,000 crore from the system is also not ruled out.

 Bond market analysts, however, said call rates (overnight funds borrowed by banks) are not likely to touch the 20 per cent mark, though they will stay firm. The call money rates will stay in double digits. They may hover around the 15 per cent mark, said a treasury chief of a leading private sector bank.

 The official said liquidity in the system would be tight as the second stage of the CRR hike comes into effect from January 6. On December 8, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a 50-basis-point hike in CRR to 5.50 per cent. 

 The two-stage hike will drain out around Rs 13,500 crore from the banking system. The CRR was first raised by quarter of a percentage point to 5.25 per cent on December 23. Analysts expect around Rs 6,500 crore to flow out after January 6.

 They feel though the firmness in call rates will continue for a few days, the situation will ease with government spending. 

 Bankers also expect good foreign currency inflows to add to liquidity. The central bank may buy dollars (thereby infusing domestic currency into the system) to shed some of the tightness.

 On Friday, call rates closed at 19 per cent after they hit an intra-day high of 21 per cent. The surge was attributed to the rush among banks to raise resources to overcome the tightening in liquidity.

 Analysts said another factor, which led to banks opting for the call money market, is the decline in their SLR securities portfolio.

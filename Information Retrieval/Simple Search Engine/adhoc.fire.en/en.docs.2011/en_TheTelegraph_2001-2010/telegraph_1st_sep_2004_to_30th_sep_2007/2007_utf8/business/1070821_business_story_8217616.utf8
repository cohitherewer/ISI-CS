 Banks spend more to curb laundering

 Calcutta, Aug. 20: Banks worldwide have increased their investments in anti-money laundering systems by nearly 60 per cent in the past three years.

 The growing complexity of financial markets and rising incidence of crime have led to this trend, according to a report by global consultant KPMG. The flow of money laundering across the globe is estimated to be $1 trillion every year. 

 The KPMG study, which involved 224 banks from 55 countries, revealed an average increase of 58 per cent between 2004 and 2007 in bank expenditure on anti-money laundering systems. 

 This increase is far in excess of the banks own forecasts in our last study in 2004, when respondents predicted a 43 per cent rise in expenditure on such processes, the report stated. 

 The increase in investment in the systems was higher for banks in North America, West Asia and Africa at around 70 per cent or more during the period. It was 37 per cent for banks in the Asia-Pacific region. Banks in Europe, CIS countries and Central and South America increased their spending between 58 and 60 per cent. 

 All banks, however, continue to spend the most on transaction monitoring and staff training.

 Combating money laundering and terrorist financing are major challenges for the banking sector, the study said, adding that a significant change in the financial and regulatory environment has led to an increased focus on anti-money laundering measures. 

 In recent years, financial regulators in different countries have tightened their noose on money laundering. 

 Banks now have a global footprint. Besides, financial markets have become more complex. There are greater investments in emerging markets. The amount of privately held wealth has also grown at the rate of over 8 per cent per annum. These structural changes entailed greater challenges for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures and risk provisioning by banks, the report said.

 The senior management in India and Asia Pacific are also taking more interest in steps to stop laundering. In 2004, banks estimated that there would be a 43 per cent growth in spending over the next three years, while the increase was actually 58 per cent, the study said.

 Mumbai, Aug. 13: Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL), which owns the Taj group of hotels, is planning to raise up to Rs 1,924 crore through two simultaneous but unlinked rights issues to fund its ambitious growth plans which include acquisitions. The board of directors today cleared the modalities for the two issues.

 IHCL informed the stock exchanges that it planned to issue shares in the ratio of 1:5 at Rs 70 apiece. The company wants to raise Rs 844 crore through this issue. The stock closed today at Rs 139.95 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 The company also plans to come out with another rights issue of five-year 4 per cent unsecured convertible debentures in the ratio of 1:10. The debentures will have a face value of Rs 150-180. After two years, these will be converted into shares at the same price.

 IHCL said the exact terms of the debentures would be determined at the time of the issue. The amount involved would be in the range of Rs 900-1,080 crore.The objective of the issues is to meet the companys long-term financing needs for capital expenditure and growth plans, including possible acquisitions, the company added.

 This is the second rights issue from the company. IHCL had first come out with a issue in the ratio of 1:3 in 1993. Apart from IHCL, other Tata group companies such as Trent and Tata Teleservices had also announced rights offers.

 Overseas acquisitions are not new to IHCL. Recently, the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire The Campton Place in San Francisco. With this acquisition, IHCL expanded its presence in the US, taking its tally to three hotels in the region. The Campton Place was acquired from the Kor Hotel group for $58 million. 

 In 2005, Taj Hotels entered into a lease agreement with The Pierre on New Yorks Fifth Avenue. In January this year, it took over the 80-year-old Landmark Hotel, now known as Taj Boston, on Arlington Street.

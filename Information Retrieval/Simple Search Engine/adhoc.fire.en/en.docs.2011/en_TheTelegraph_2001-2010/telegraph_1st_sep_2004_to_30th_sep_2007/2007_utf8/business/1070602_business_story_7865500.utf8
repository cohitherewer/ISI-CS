 Inflation drop fails to cheer govt

New Delhi, June 1: A fall in the inflation rate did not deter the government from warning against rising prices of manufactured items and companies getting together and pushing up prices.

 As the government announced a fall in the inflation rate to 5.06 per cent for the week ended May 19, commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath said the government would severely deal with cartelisation.

 Lower prices of pulses, wheat and manufactured products pulled down inflation.

 The wholesale price index stood at 5.05 per cent in the corresponding week a year ago. Manufactured food items, including processed tea, sugar and butter, became cheaper.

 Analysts said the Reserve Banks initiatives to raise interest rates over the last few months have started paying off and lower inflation figures could become the norm in the near future, unless the monsoon starts playing up.

 However, prices of cement went up 0.2 per cent during the week. Fruits and vegetables also became costlier. But the impact was more than offset by the fall in prices of other food items.

 Naths warning comes close on the heels of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs advice to industry to resist cartelisation.

 The cabinet committee on prices has decided that imports should be encouraged to improve the supply of goods to moderate prices, he added.

 The prices have risen because of high demand of various commodities resulting from the robust growth of 9.4 per cent in 2006-07, Nath said. 

 To deal with the demand on a long-term basis, the cabinet committee has decided to encourage the creation of fresh capacities.

 Nath said it was becoming difficult to manage the impact of high growth, which was contributing to the rise of the rupee and prices. We have to calibrate policies to minimise the impact of GDP growth on prices, he added.

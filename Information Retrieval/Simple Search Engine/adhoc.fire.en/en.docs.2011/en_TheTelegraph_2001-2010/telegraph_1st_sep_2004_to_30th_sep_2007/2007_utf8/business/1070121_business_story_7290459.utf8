 Calcutta, Jan. 20: The promoters of Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Co will pump in Rs 100 crore before March-end to keep the solvency margin at a comfortable level in the face of a 100 per cent year-on-year growth registered by the joint venture firm over the past four years. 

 We are targeting a new premium income of Rs 5,000 crore for the current financial year and Rs 1,000 crore from renewal premium income. To achieve this target, a fresh capital infusion worth Rs 100 crore will be required before March 31, said Sam Ghosh, chief executive officer, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company, after launching the companys first health insurance product, HealthCare.

 The insurer, a joint venture between Bajaj Auto Ltd and Allianz AG of Germany, registered Rs 2,717 crore from first premium income in 2005-06. Our business growth during the current financial year is 100 per cent and we expect to maintain the same tempo in 2007-08 also, Ghosh said. 

 To maintain growth at this rate, we will require a capital infusion of Rs 150 crore every year. Currently, our equity capital stands at Rs 570 crore, he added. 

 The life insurer, which has been valued at $2.4 billion by different investment bankers, has also extended its break-even deadline to nine years from five years in the face of a rapidly growing business. When we started out, it was estimated that we could break-even after five years growing at the rate of 40-45 per cent. But now, at the fifth year of operations, we believe that we wont be able to break-even before another three to four years if our business grows at the rate of 100 per cent every year, Ghosh said.

 After introducing a capital protection plan and a pension plan recently, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company has launched a three-year health plan with a minimum premium of Rs 100 per month. HealthCare, as the plan is called, comes with six benefits a life cover, cash benefit for hospitalisation, post hospitalisation benefit, surgical benefit, critical illness benefit and accident benefit. Each of these benefits has a limit and one can avail of any of these benefits up to 10 times the basic limit. 

 A woman will have to pay a higher premium rate (till she is in her pre-menopausal age) than a man of the same age group. However, the premium rate for a male buyer vis--vis the fairer sex shoots up significantly beyond 40 years.

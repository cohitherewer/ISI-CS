 Q amp;A

 Bank deposits

 I am a retired person and have invested some money in the post office monthly income scheme. As banks are giving higher interest than post office MIS, I would like to invest in UTI Banks fixed deposit scheme. If I keep the money in a joint account, will I have to pay tax on the interest income?

 Chandidas Banerjee, Tribeni

 At present, bank fixed deposits are more attractive than post office monthly income schemes. While the post office monthly income schemes fetch only 8 per cent interest (the 10 per cent maturity bonus has also been withdrawn), bank deposits earn around 10 per cent. But interest income on bank fixed deposits is subject to TDS if the amount exceeds Rs 10,000 a year. Though interest income from post office schemes is taxable, it does not come under TDS. You can file Form 15H at the time of opening the bank fixed deposit for non-deduction of tax. But you have to show the interest amount as other income in your income tax return and pay tax on it.

 Interest income

 I am a senior citizen and have invested in two fixed deposits of Rs 48,000 each with a nationalised bank. From financial year 2007-08, no TDS will be deducted if the accrued interest is less than or equal to Rs 10,000. Do I still need to submit Form 15H for non-deduction of tax at source? 

 K. Ray, Calcutta

 The limit on interest income for tax deduction at source includes all interest income that a depositor gets during a financial year from his/her different accounts in a particular bank branch. So, if your total annual interest income from a bank branch is more than Rs 10,000, you will still have to submit Form 15H.

 Property proceeds

 I am a senior citizen. Two months ago, I sold my house. May I invest the sale proceeds in bank fixed deposits without attracting capital gains tax? Can I avoid the tax payment by gifting the amount to my daughter?

 D.J. Guha, Calcutta

 You cannot avoid capital gains tax either by investing the proceeds in bank fixed deposits or gifting the money to your daughter. To avoid capital gains tax, you will either have to buy a new house or invest the money in capital gains bonds of the National Highway Authority of India or the Rural Electrification Corporation.

 Calcutta, June 29: Kesoram Industries, the flagship company of the BK Birla group, has lined up investments worth Rs 1,200 crore over the next two years to expand its tyre and cement capacities.

 The company will add 1.3 million tonnes of cement capacity to the existing Gulbarga unit in Karnataka.

 After the completion of the project, Kesorams cement capacity will touch 5 million tonnes.

 The company also plans to set up a 320-tonnes-a-day plant for car radials and truck tyres near Haridwar in Uttarakhand to take advantage of tax sops. The land for the unit has already been acquired.

 Shiv Kumar Parik, director and company secretary of Kesoram, said the Rs 1,200-crore expansion would be funded by debt worth Rs 1,000 crore. The remaining funds will come from internal accruals.

 B.K. Birla made these announcement at Kesorams 88th annual general meeting here today. At the meeting, he reiterated his decision to hand over the company to grandson Kumar Mangalam Birla. Younger daughter Manjushree Khaitan would also be there in the company, he added. Shareholders were upbeat about the succession plan, calling it a good decision.

 According to the earlier succession plan of the Birla patriarch, Kesoram was to be given to Manjushree. Manjushree, who is on the board of Kesoram since 2001, was present at todays AGM, but left immediately after the meeting.

 Birla was circumspect today on what prompted him to change the plan or who would manage the two smaller companies of the group, Mangalam Cement and ECE Industries. However, he confirmed that Vidula Jalan, the daughter of Manjushree and a director on the board of Mangalam Timber, would run it.

 He also praised the executives running his companies.

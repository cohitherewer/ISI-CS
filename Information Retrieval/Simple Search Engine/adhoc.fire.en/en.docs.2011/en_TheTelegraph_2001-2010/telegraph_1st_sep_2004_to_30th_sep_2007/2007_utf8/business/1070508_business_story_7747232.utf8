 Reliance plea on SEZ rules

 New Delhi, May 7 (PTI): Reliance Industries, which plans to set up two mega SEZs in the country, today requested the government to review its decision on limiting the size of such zones to 5,000 hectares.

 Anand Jain, who heads Reliances SEZ division, made a detailed presentation to commerce secretary G.K. Pillai where officials of the department of revenue were also present, a commerce ministry spokesperson said.

 Reliance has in-principle approvals for two SEZs of 10,000 hectares each in Haryana and Maharashtra. 

 But the decision of the empowered group of ministers on SEZs putting a limit of of 5,000 hectares and barring the state governments from acquiring land on behalf of developers has created difficulties for the developers of mega projects.

 This decision has also upset Reliances plans as it is acquiring land at a fast pace. Company officials stated last month that an SEZ below 10,000 hectares would not be viable.

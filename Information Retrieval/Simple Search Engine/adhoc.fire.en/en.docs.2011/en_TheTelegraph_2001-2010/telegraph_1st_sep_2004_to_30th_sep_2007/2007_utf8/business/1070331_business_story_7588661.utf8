 Big push for GAIL pipeline

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Choubey: Going ahead

 New Delhi, March 30: The government has cleared the decks for GAIL to go ahead with a Rs 18,000-crore investment plan to lay five inter-state gas pipelines.

 The pipeline plan includes the 876-km Jagdishpur-Haldia project, which is expected to be completed in three to four years. On completion, the pipeline will pave the way for supplying piped gas to Calcutta kitchens. 

 According to GAIL officials, the Jagdishpur-Haldia pipeline will have facilities for a bi-directional flow. The pipeline will pass through Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The estimated investment is around Rs 2,000 crore and the proposed pipeline will have the capacity to carry 25 million standard cubic metres of gas per day (MMSCD). 

 The ministry of petroleum and natural gas has approved the request of GAIL to invite expressions of interest (EoIs) for the five new natural gas pipelines.

 The other four projects are the Dadri-Bawana-Nangal pipeline, Chainsa-Gurgaon-Jhajjhar-Hissar link, Dabhol-Bangalore connection and Kochi-Kanjirkkod-Bangalore-Mangalore network. The total length of these five pipelines will be around 3,300 km.

 In addition to these, GAIL will be laying three pipelines to augment capacities of DahejVijaipur link (610 km), VijaipurDadri connection (505 km) and VijaipurAuraiyaJagdishpur network (571 km). The carrying capacity of these three pipelines would be 74 million standard cubic metres per day (MMSCMD). 

 GAIL chairman U.D. Choubey said EoIs for booking capacities in the five new natural gas pipelines on common carrier basis will be invited soon. The total length of these pipelines along with the three capacity augmentation lines will be around 5,000 km.

 He said the estimated investment would be Rs 18,000 crore. This would strengthen GAILs position as a major gas transmission company and add to the existing network of over 5,600 km. 

 Choubey said these pipelines would be built by GAIL on ownership basis and will be completed in two phases in the next three to four years.

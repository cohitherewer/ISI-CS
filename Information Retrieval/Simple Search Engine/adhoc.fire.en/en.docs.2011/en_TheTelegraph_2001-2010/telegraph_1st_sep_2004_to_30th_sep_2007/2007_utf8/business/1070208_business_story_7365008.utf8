 Sources said the other suitors for the tractor company were Tata Motors, Tractors and Farm Equipment Limited (Tafe), Sonalika Group and John Deere. The market capitalisation of Actis stake has jumped to Rs 500 crore from Rs 270 crore when it picked up the stake in Punjab Tractors in 2003. The Burmans acquired their stake for approximately Rs 200 crore.

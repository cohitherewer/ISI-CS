 Low-cost Vodafone handsets

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 22: Just days after successfully completing the acquisition of a majority stake in Hutchison Essar, Vodafone is moving aggressively to snap up subscribers.

 The British company is planning to launch ultra-low-cost handsets priced between Rs 1,025 and Rs 1,845 in the country over the next few months. 

 On Monday, the company branded low-cost handsets Vodafone 125 and Vodafone 225 which it feels are perfect as first handsets for people in a developing market. They are likely to retail at $25-$45 depending on the specific model and local market conditions.

 Vodafone said in India the cost of a mobile handset can be one of the key barriers to using mobile services. 

 These low-cost handsets are intended to help drive mobile penetration. 

 Vodafones plan to offer these handsets comes after Reliance Communications launched entry-level handsets at as low as Rs 777, which is almost half the price of existing colour handsets of Rs 1,600. 

 Black and white handsets sell for around Rs 1,000.

 Vodafone 125 and Vodafone 225 are the first handsets manufactured for it by Chinas ZTE Corporation, following a global handset procurement agreement signed between the two in December 2006.

 The handsets are almost identical in functionality. The Vodafone 125 has a black and white screen and the Vodafone 225 has a colour screen.

 Vodafone Egypt, Vodafone Romania and Vodacom (South Africa) will also launch these handsets over the next few weeks.

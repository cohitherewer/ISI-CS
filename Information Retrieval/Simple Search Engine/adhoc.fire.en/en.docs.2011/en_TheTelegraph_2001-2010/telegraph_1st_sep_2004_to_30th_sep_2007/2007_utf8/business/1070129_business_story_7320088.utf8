 Six make navratna shortlist

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Open sesame

 New Delhi, Jan. 28: An inter-ministerial committee has identified six companies as eligible for the navratna status. These are Power Finance Corporation, Power Grid Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation, National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, Bharat Electronics and Hindustan Aeronautics.

 Navratna status gives public sector companies more financial power and their boards can clear investment proposals of up to Rs 500 crore without the approval of the finance ministry or the cabinet.

 Navratna companies also have more flexibility in floating subsidiaries, forming joint ventures and recruiting staff than other public sector firms. 

 BSNL, which has been applying for the navratna status since 2001, has missed the boat again. To get the status, a miniratna company has to be rated excellent or very good for three years in a row based on the performance parameters set out in a memorandum of understanding that it signs with its administrative ministry every year. 

 BSNL has achieved this for two years. Sources said the telecom company could get the navratna status next fiscal. 

 There are nine navratna PSUs, including ONGC, Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum, GAIL, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd and MTNL. 

 The management of the navratna companies has enhanced financial powers to expedite the decision-making process and avoid the red tape involved in clearing investment proposals.

 The Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) is out of the race as the shipping ministry decided to withdraw its claim at the last moment. 

 The proposal to grant navratna status to SCI was put before the committee but could not be considered as the shipping ministry dithered, official sources said.

 The ministry had first sought postponement of the committees meeting twice but then withdrew the case, saying it wanted to review it further.

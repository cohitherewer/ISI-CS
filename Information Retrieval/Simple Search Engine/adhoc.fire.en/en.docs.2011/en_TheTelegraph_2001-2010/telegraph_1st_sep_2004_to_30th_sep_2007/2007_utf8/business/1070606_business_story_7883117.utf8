 MTNL hops on to realty bandwagon

 SPREADING OUT

 New Delhi, June 5: State-owned telecom major Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited is making a foray into the real estate business.

 MTNL owns large tracts of land in Delhi and Mumbai, which will be leased out to develop information technology parks, company officials said. The PSU does not plan to hive off its land bank into a separate company. So the income from the IT park business will be added to the companys balance sheet.

 Initially, MTNL plans to develop an 80,000 square metre IT park in Sector 62, Noida. The company has already identified a consortium of developers for this project, officials said.

 A major IT firm has expressed its willingness to set up its office in the park. However, MTNL officials refused to give any details.

 MTNLs move follows the governments decision to hive off the property owned by Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited into a separate company. 

 MTNL will take 18 months to develop the IT park. Analysts estimate the rents to be in the range of Rs 55-60 per square feet.

 The company is also identifying developers for its land in Delhi and Mumbai, said officials. Developers will not have any stake in the Noida IT park. So, MTNL will come up with a revenue-sharing model with them.

 Similar projects are being undertaken by other real estate companies, including DLF and Unitech.

 On June 4, Unitechs investment arm, Unitech Corporate Parks, received the formal nod from the board of approvals to set up two IT SEZs in Greater Noida and Bengal.

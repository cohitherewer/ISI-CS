 Q amp;A

 Interest income

 I am 80 years old. I noticed a finance ministry notification in a newspaper that senior citizens are allowed exemption on interest received on bank deposits or post office deposits up to Rs 10,000. Is it true?

 M.M. Basu, Calcutta

 In his budget proposal for 2007-08, finance minister 

 P. Chidambaram has proposed a hike in the limit on annual 

 interest income from bank and post office deposits for 

 tax deduction at source to Rs 10,000 from Rs 5,000 earlier. 

 The higher limit (for TDS purposes) is applicable to 

 all depositors, including senior citizens.

 Selling shares

 I bought some shares of a company in 2000. Now I want to sell those shares. Do I have to pay capital gains tax?

 C. Mullick, Hooghly

 No, you dont have to pay any capital gains tax on the sale of those shares. Equity transactions are exempt from long-term capital gains tax provided the shares are held for more than 12 months from transfer of the title in the owners name till the time of sale and the seller has paid the security transaction tax (STT). If you sell your shares through a recognised stock exchange such as the BSE or NSE and pay the STT, you dont have to pay any capital gains tax.

 Senior citizen benefits

 My date of birth is January 1, 1943. Will I be considered a senior citizen while calculating the income and tax payable for the financial year 2006-07? My income will not exceed Rs 1,85,000 in that financial year. Do I have to submit income tax return?

 Kshitish Chandra Debnath, Calcutta

 According to the existing provisions of the income tax act, a senior citizen is a person who has attained 65 years of age or more in the year previous to the year of assessment and the previous year refers to the financial year preceding the assessment year. Since you will attain 65 years of age on January 2008, you will not get the income tax benefits allowed to senior citizens for the assessment year 2007-08. However, you will get those benefits in the assessment year 2008-09.

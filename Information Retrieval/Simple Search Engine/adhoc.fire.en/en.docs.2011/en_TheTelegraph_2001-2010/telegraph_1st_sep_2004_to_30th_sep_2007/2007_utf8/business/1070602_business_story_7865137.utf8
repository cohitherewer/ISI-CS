 Exports rise 23% in April

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 1: The countrys exports clocked a 23.06 per cent year-on-year growth to touch $10.57 billion during April despite the appreciation of the rupee.

 However, with imports recording an over 40 per cent growth, the trade deficit jumped 79 per cent to $7 billion from $3.9 billion in April last year. The bulk of the rise in imports was accounted for by non-oil goods and commodities, which went up by 54.29 per cent to $13.21 billion.

 Senior officials said a robust economic growth resulted in increased imports of capital goods and a liberalised import regime.

 Oil imports rose by a modest 11.4 per cent to $4.42 billion because the prices of the Indian basket of crude at $68 per barrel was at the same level for this month as in the previous year.

 There were fears that the appreciation of the rupee would lead to a slowdown of exports as they become more expensive for foreign buyers who pay in dollars. 

 The April figures show that the fears over the impact of the rising rupee on exports were exaggerated, say analysts.

 However, in the wake of a 12.7 per cent increase in the rupee value, the government is taking steps to help small exporters so that the target of $160 billion for 2007-08 is met.

 Exporters have been raising a hue and cry over the appreciation of the rupee. But the figures for the first month of the current fiscal do not bear this out.

 Officials say rise in non-oil imports underlines increased economic activity and creation of new productive capacities. Besides, the government has recently lowered customs duty on a number of items.

 Commenting on export performance, commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath said exporters should set ambitious targets and difficulties like the rising rupee and input costs should be dealt with by improving efficiency.

 He also asked exporters to look at new markets.

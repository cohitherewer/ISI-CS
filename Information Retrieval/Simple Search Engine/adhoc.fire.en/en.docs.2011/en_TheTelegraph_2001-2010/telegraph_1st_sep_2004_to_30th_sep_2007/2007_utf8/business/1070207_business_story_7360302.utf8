 Spanner in GIPL offer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 6: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has disallowed Gammon Infrastructure Projects Ltd (GIPL), a subsidiary of Gammon India, from proceeding with its initial public offering (IPO).

 The market regulator, through a letter on February2, advised merchant bankers of GIPL that the proposed IPO could not be permitted for one year from the Sebi order dated December 21, 2006.

 Gammon India said it had appealed against the Sebi order of December 21.

 Sebi had barred Gammon India, its chairman, Abhijit Rajan, and two other entities from selling their shareholding in Gammon Infrastructure Projects.

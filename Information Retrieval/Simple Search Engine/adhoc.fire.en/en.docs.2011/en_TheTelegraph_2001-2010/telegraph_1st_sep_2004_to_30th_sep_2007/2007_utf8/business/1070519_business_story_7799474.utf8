 BSE meets share sale deadline

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 18: The Bombay Stock Exchange today completed a nearly two-year exercise of corporatising itself by offloading a 51 per cent of broker members stake to 19 investors, including the SBI, the Bank of India, the LIC and the Aditya Birla group, besides Deutsche Borse and Singapore Exchange.

 Market regulator Sebi had set May 19 as the deadline for completing the corporatisation or demutualisation process, under which at least 51 per cent of equity shares of the 133-year-old exchange was to be divested to investors other than member brokers having trading rights.

 Before the demutualisation, 790 broker members held a 100 per cent stake in the BSE, Asias oldest bourse.

 Infosys CEO designate Kris Gopalakrishnan and Atticus Capital of New York are among the 19 who have picked up stakes in the bourse, market sources said, without giving details of the holdings of individual investors.

 These 19 investors have picked up a 41 per cent stake and the remaining 10 per cent was sold to Deutsche Borse and Singapore Exchange, who picked up 5 per cent each for Rs 189 crore at Rs 5,200 per share earlier this year. The market capitalisation of the BSE now stands at around $1 billion.

 Among the 19 new investors are pedigreed marquee domestic and overseas institutions as well as select domestic corporate houses and high net worth individuals, the BSE said.

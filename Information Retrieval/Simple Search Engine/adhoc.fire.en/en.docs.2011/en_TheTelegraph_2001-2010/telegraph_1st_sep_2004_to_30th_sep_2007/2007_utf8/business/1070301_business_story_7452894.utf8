The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Fund frolic for plantation crops

Calcutta, Feb. 28: With better price realisation in the plantation sector, commodities like coffee, rubber, spice, coconut and cashew are set to have their own special purpose fund. This was announced by finance minister P. Chidambaram in the Union Budget 2007-08.

 The minister of state for commerce and industry, Jairam Ramesh informed The Telegraph that approvals for the funds would be cleared in the next two to three months.

 All the initial studies for coffee, rubber and spices have been done by the respective commodity boards and we will follow the broad outlines as has been done for the special purpose fund (SPTF) for tea. The coffee fund will be of Rs 800 crore for replantation and rejuvenation of 80,000 hectares in the next ten years. The report by SBI Caps for coffee has been submitted recently, Ramesh said. The coffee fund would receive Rs 400 crore from the central government and an equal amount form the industry. 

 An estimated Rs 400 crore is needed for 50,000 hectares under pepper and Rs 500 crore for rubber replantation in 50,000 hectares.

 A special purpose vehicle would be floated by the commerce ministry to execute this programme. 

 For tea, Rs 567.1 crore was proposed during 2006-07. The amount will spill over in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan for replantation of 85,044 hectares. The tea fund was the first of its kind to disburse loans based on the cash flow of gardens and not their balance sheets.

 For the first time in the last four years our tea exports have crossed the 200 million kg mark to reach 203 million kg while average price realisation have been higher by Rs 8 per kg. While coffee has also had a good year with an estimated production of 2.78-2.88 lakh tonnes, the highest in five years, and a record price realisation of Rs 78,000 per tonne. These funds would help to maintain this momentum over the long-term, Ramesh pointed out.

 The first loan agreement under the fund which entails 25 per cent subsidy, 25 per cent from the tea garden grower and 50 per cent as soft loan and the other special purpose funds are likely to follow the same model.

 For coffee growers, the ministry has taken other steps such as restructuring of loans and interest subsidy on working capital loans of five per cent for small growers.

 However, certain sections of the rubber board had earlier said such a fund for rubber would not be feasible because the potential participants were largely small holders and the administrative cost of maintaining the account would be phenomenal.

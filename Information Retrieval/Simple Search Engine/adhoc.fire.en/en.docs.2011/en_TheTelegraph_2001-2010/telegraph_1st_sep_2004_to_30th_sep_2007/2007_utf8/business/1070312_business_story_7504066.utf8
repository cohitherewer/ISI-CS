 Global trends to sway sentiments

 UNCERTAIN DAYS

 Is the correction over? Was the latest crash a mere spasm and will the markets get up, brush off the dust and continue on their upward journey, as has happened so many times in the last four years? 

 That depends on the global economy the fall in the Indian market is part and parcel of a global sell-off, although local factors, such as rising interest rates, have also contributed. (After all, the Indian market was already down 8 per cent from its highs before the global crash occurred.)

 At first glance, everything seems to be back on track. One of the reasons for the sell-off was the rise in the value of the yen, which led to the carry trade (borrowing at low rates of interest in currencies like the yen to fund investments in high-yielding assets) being unwound. The yen had tumbled from around 122 to the dollar to almost 115, but it has since recovered to 118. The second reason attributed for the crash was the fear of a slowdown in the US economy, sparked by big defaults in the US sub-prime mortgage market. But the latest US data show that the unemployment rate dropped close to a five-year low in February, indicating strong growth.

 Here are other cues from the global economy that show growth is alive and kicking: Australias economy grew twice as much as forecast in the fourth quarter; investment by Japanese companies surged 16.8 per cent in the last quarter; and European manufacturing facilities are operating at the fastest pace in more than a decade.

 If the recent crash was the result of a growth scare, as CLSA strategist Chris Wood believes, there are plenty of reasons to be comforted. The biggest source of reassurance, however, is that if a recession looms in the US, the Fed will cut rates.

 But what if inflation lurks on the horizon? The fact that European factories are operating at the limits of their capacity is an inflationary signal. In Japan, a recent survey showed that the job market is getting tighter, another signal of impending inflation. And comments from one of the US Fed members, William Poole, shows that the Fed will be in no hurry to cut rates. So whats the scenario? Higher interest rates in Europe and Japan and no guarantee of a US rate cut. Which means that global liquidity will get tighter.

 The boom of the last four years has been accompanied by a sharp rise in financial leverage. Hedge funds and all kinds of derivatives have seen a huge rise in volumes. Credit default swaps, for instance, which are a kind of credit insurance, have allowed banks to ramp up their lending. 

 The concern is not only that a crack in one segment of the market, for example a sharp rise in the yen or a meltdown in the sub-prime mortgage market in the US, may lead to the contagion spreading to other sectors the big question is to what extent has the financial sector driven overall growth. For instance, it is borrowing by the US consumer that sustains Chinese exports. Or to take an example closer home, to what extent has Indias boom been dependent on debt-fuelled consumption and home buying? In other words, is it the huge growth of the financial sector and high borrowings that have been responsible for recent global growth?

 Back home, heres a worrying fact: Chinas wheat harvest, the largest in the world, will fall by 4.2 per cent this year, says a Chinese government agency. That should keep up the pressure on food prices and may lead to even higher interest rates. So far, all these concerns have been brushed off. The imbalances keep getting bigger, the debt mountain keeps growing and yet the markets have climbed new highs. How long can that continue?

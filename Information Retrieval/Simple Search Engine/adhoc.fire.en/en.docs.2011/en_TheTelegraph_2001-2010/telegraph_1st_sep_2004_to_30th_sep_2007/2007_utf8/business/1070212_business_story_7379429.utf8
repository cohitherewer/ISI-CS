The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Italy focus on state farms

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Feb. 11: Italian business organisation Confindustria, which is bringing a delegation of 200 companies, 40 industrial associations and six leading banks, will sign an MoU with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) to initiate an agri-product processing cluster in the state.

 A total of eight to nine MoUs will be signed with Indian companies and organisations during the delegations visit to India.

 We have appointed an Italian consultant, Octagon, which will do a market survey on the opportunities in food processing in the state and submit a report by June 2007. Decisions about the investment amount and the kind of agri-products to be processed in the cluster will be taken based on the survey, said a Confindustria spokesperson.

 The delegation, led by the Italian prime minister Romano Prodi and four other ministers, will include representatives from the Parma food cluster of Italy. The representatives will share their experiences in setting up such a cluster. Discussions will also be held on how this model could be adapted for Bengal.

 The delegation, which will first come to Calcutta and then travel to Mumbai and Delhi, will have representatives from 350 Italian small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

 The SME focus will especially be for Bengal. The Italian companies are looking at opportunities in sectors where the state has a strong presence such as leather, tourism infrastructure, agri-processing, incentives and financial facilities for SMEs. Luxury leather furniture brand Poltrona Frau is looking for Indian partners and collaborations. 

 A spokesperson from the company said with Calcuttas prominence in the leather industry, this could be a great opportunity. Bank of Baroda will sign an MoU with Unicredito Italiano-owned Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A, while Italian logistics and construction firm Tecnimont will also enter into a pact with an Indian counterpart. Italian fashion brand Benetton is part of the delegation.

 The banking group, represented by Associazione Bancaria Italiana (ABI), or Italian Banking Association, will hold meetings with local counterparts and will present new financial instruments the Italian banking industry is developing with an eye on India. 

 The combined revenues of the companies would be 170 billion euros, while the banking system present in the delegation has total assets of more than 1 trillion euros.

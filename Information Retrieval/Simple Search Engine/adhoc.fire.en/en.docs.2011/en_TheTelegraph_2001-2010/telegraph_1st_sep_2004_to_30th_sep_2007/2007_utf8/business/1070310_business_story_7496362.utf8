 Calcutta, March 9: IDFC Private Equity and GIC Special Investments of Singapore have invested Rs 150 crore in Quipo Infrastructure Equipment Ltd, valuing the company at Rs 500 crore.

 The Calcutta-based Srei Infrastructure Finance-sponsored company will offer 15.5 per cent stake each to IDFC and GIC following the transaction. Sreis stake will also be diluted from 26 per cent to 15.5 per cent.

 The fresh capital infusion will enable the firm to raise debt to grow its infrastructure asset leasing business.

 Quipo plans to invest Rs 3,400 crore over the next two years. Sunil Kanoria, managing director of Quipo, said a debt of Rs 1,200 crore would be raised next fiscal.

 Bulk of the investment, about Rs 2,000 crore, will be spent to build telecom infrastructure across the country.

 Quipo plans to set up 6,000 mobile telephone towers to lease out to various telecom companies. 

 Moreover, the company intends to invest a few hundred crores in the oil and gas business.

 Quipo operates in five major verticals construction, oil and gas, telecom, energy rental and valuation and asset disposal.

 At present, construction contributes to bulk of the business. Kanoria said the telecom vertical, run through majority-owned subsidiary Quipo Telecom, would contribute significantly.

 The company has another majority-owned subsidiary Quipo Oil and Gas and two joint ventures for construction and asset disposal.

 The company is expected to clock a turnover of Rs 200 crore on a consolidated basis. It is expected to double in the next fiscal.

 Our investment in Quipo has appreciated from Rs 12 crore five years ago to Rs 75 crore now. The model was innovative, but it worked, Hemant Kanoria, vice-chairman and managing director of Srei, said.

 Quipo started as an equipment bank which had company-owned machines that were let out. Construction companies can also deposit their idle equipment with Quipo for leasing out.

 IDFC Private Equity

 Satish Mandhana, vice-president of IDFC Private Equity, said the fund was a long-term investor in Quipo and not in a hurry to cash out.

 We will wait for the right time to take the company public, Mandhana said.

 IDFC PE manages funds worth Rs 2,850 crore. It has closed a fund of Rs 900 crore while receiving commitment from international and domestic institutional communities for another Rs 2,000 crore. IDFC PE would invest in port, airport, railways, gas grid, road and companies.

 Bankers divided over rate cut prospects

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, July 22: Home loan borrowers, who have seen interest rates climb by over 500 basis points in the past three years, may have to wait for some more time to see the beginning of a drop in rates. 

 Though inflation is under check and a perception is gaining ground of interest rates having reached a peak, bankers are divided over a fall coming quickly as the prevalent mood of optimism is the result of an excess liquidity in the system which could be a temporary trend.

 The perception of falling rates in the future is the outcome of inflation staying within manageable limits.

 Interest rate manoeuvres by some banks and housing finance companies have only added to the upbeat sentiment.

 The banks have withdrawn some of their special deposit mobilisation plans, while the housing financing companies have extended their schemes of low interest rates on mortgages.

 Recent data shows inflation to be steady at 4.27 per cent, staying within the band of 4-4.5 per cent set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Centre. 

 The low levels have led analysts to predict a hands-off policy of the RBI vis--vis key rates when it announces its monetary and credit policy at the end of this month. 

 There are even expectations of a rate cut following the withdrawal of the special deposit schemes by the banks. 

 Already the State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank have discontinued some of the schemes. 

 In home loans, the Housing Development Finance Corporation has extended the scheme that offered concessional rates up to 25 basis points by another month. 

 However, there are many in the banking system who point out that these signals do not mean that rates will necessarily come down. 

 The decision (to extend the concessional home loan scheme) means that interest rates have peaked. It does not mean that they will come down soon. If we had felt that interest rates were indeed coming down, then the prime lending rate would itself have been reduced, said a senior official from one of the housing finance companies. 

 The official added that few banks had been loathe to accept deposits at higher interest rates as there was abundant liquidity in the banking system, evident from inter-bank call money rates ruling below one per cent. 

 Apart from the sharp increase in deposits, which have been growing at around 22 per cent, cash in the banking system has swelled because of the RBIs intervention in the forex and money markets. 

 Given these conditions, the official added that a firm indication on interest rates will be available only when the central bank announces its monetary and credit policy.

 Few analysts are not ruling out the possibility of the RBI resorting to yet another hike in the cash reserve ratio and announcing some other measures to drain out excess liquidity in the system.

 Calcutta, July 6: The Bank of Maharashtra (BoM) will decide on its non-life insurance venture in the next one month.

 The Pune-headquartered bank is in talks with Shriram Group for the insurance foray even as it does not rule out a foreign partner. Shriram Group is a leading private sector finance company in the south.

 The chairman and managing director of the Bank of Maharashtra, M.D. Mallya, said the bank would not be the dominant partner in the venture.

 But we will have a strategic stake. The broad contours of the partnership will be finalised in a month, Mallya said.

 The CMD was in the city today to attend the Banking Conclave organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

 Mallya also outlined the capital raising plan of the bank for the current year.

 The bank plans to raise Rs 650 crore as tier II capital to maintain the capital adequacy ratio.

 Looking at the way business is growing, we need this fund, he said.

 The capital adequacy ratio of the bank was 12.06 per cent at the end of the last fiscal. It plans to maintain the ratio at 12 per cent in the future.

 The money will be raised through bonds and perpetual debt this year. Mallya said a dilution of the governments stake was also a possibility.

 The governments holding in the Bank of Maharashtra is 77 per cent. So, we clearly have a headway in that front, Mallya said.

 But he ruled out the possibility of a follow-on public offer this fiscal.

 The bank has deposits worth Rs 33,000 crore. Its advances stood at Rs 24,000 crore. About 80 per cent of its deposits are by individuals.

 Financial inclusion

 The bank has taken up a project whereby every family in Maharashtra will have a bank account.

 We are co-ordinating with other banks to achieve this. There will be one lead bank in each district. For instance, we are a lead bank in six out of 22 districts of the state, he said.

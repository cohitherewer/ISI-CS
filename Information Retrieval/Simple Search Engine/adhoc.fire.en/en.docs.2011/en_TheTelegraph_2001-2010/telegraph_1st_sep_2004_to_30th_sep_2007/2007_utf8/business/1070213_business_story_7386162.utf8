 UTI Mutual schemes lose gloss

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

Calcutta, Feb. 12: In the aftermath of the US-64 scam, schemes of the UTI Mutual Fund are fast losing their charm among investors.

 RBI data on Changes in Financial Assets/Liabilities of The Household Sector show retail investors continuously selling units of UTI Mutual Funds since 2000-01.

 According to the apex banks preliminary estimates for 2005-06, though the total financial assets of the household sector increased to Rs 5,88,656 crore from Rs 4,35,706 crore in 2004-05, there was net selling in UTI units by retail investors to the extent of Rs 444 crore. 

 In 2004-05, the household sector reduced its holding in units of UTI Mutual Fund schemes by Rs 3,146 crore. 

 The reduction was most significant in 2003-04 when retail investors cut down their unit holdings by Rs 8,586 crore. 

 As it downsized its holding in the UTI schemes from 2000-01, the household sector made net additions to all other financial assets, such as bank deposits, currency holding, life insurance, provident and pension funds, shares and units of other mutual funds. 

 The household sectors asset build-up in shares and units of other mutual funds rose sharply to Rs 29,452 crore in 2005-06 from Rs 8,113 crore in 2004-05. 

 This indicates a shift in loyalty among retail investors away from Unit Trust of India to private mutual fund houses.

 Currency holding by the household sector, too, increased between 2004-05 and 2005-06. 

 The increase in the amount of currency with the household sector was Rs 36,977 crore in 2004-05, which went up to Rs 51,954 crore in 2005-06.

 Bank deposits by the household sector also increased significantly to Rs 2,74,641 crore in 2005-06 from Rs 1,58,259 crore in the previous year.

 Alongside the growth in financial assets, the household sectors financial liability has also suddenly spurted to Rs 1,21,187 crore in 2004-05 from Rs 70,732 crore in 2003-04 and to Rs 1,82,539 crore in 2005-06. 

 An interesting aspect of liabilities is of growth being fuelled by a significant increase in bank loans. The increase in the household sectors bank loans and advances was Rs 57,885 crore in 2003-04. In the following year, this went up to Rs 1,11,667 crore and to Rs 1,75,010 crore in 2005-06. 

 The sudden rise in bank loans could be attributed to expansion in credit cards, personal and housing loans. 

 However, people borrowed less from the government, non-bank financial institutions and co-operative societies over the same period.

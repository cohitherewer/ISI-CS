 Mallya: Strategic move

 Mumbai, Sept 26: Vijay Mallya, chairman of United Breweries (Holdings) and Kingfisher Airlines, has bought a 50 per cent strategic stake in US aircraft maker Epic Aircraft for $120 million.

 Epic Aircraft, a unit of Aircraft Investor Resources LLC, manufactures private business jets with single and twin engines, capable of carrying six to seven people.

 Epic was looking for a strategic partner, not just an investor, said Rick Schrameck, president and CEO of Epic Aircraft. Mallya now has a significant interest in our company, and we will immediately benefit from his relationships with a variety of companies, including Airbus and Pratt amp; Whitney.

 Mallya said, I am very excited about the phenomenal opportunities that Epic has in the industry today and this strategic investment will pave the way for the company to embark on an unprecedented growth trajectory.

 Mallyas UB Holdings controls Kingfisher Airlines and owns 26 per cent in Deccan Aviation, which operates low-cost carrier Air Deccan. Together, the two airlines control about 30 per cent of the domestic aviation market.

 Kingfisher Airlines was among the first to order the new Airbus A-380 and is one of the pan-European aircraft manufacturers largest customers.

 Mallya and Schrameck have a lot in common: they both share a passion for cars and have won races on professional racing circuits. Schrameck acknowledged that their common interests would set the stage for a great working relationship.

 Its a great relationship, Schrameck added. Vijay has already brought Airbus into the role of consultants for our certification programmes. 

 Epic is in the advanced stages of flight testing for the Dynasty, the 1200hp single-engine turboprop. The company recently unveiled two very light jets, the twin-engine Elite and the single-engine Victory. The jets will begin their certification process immediately after the Dynasty.

 The deal will give Epic the ability to accelerate the process of bringing the companys growing line of aircraft to the certified market. It will also strengthen the companys relationships with customers and vendors world wide.

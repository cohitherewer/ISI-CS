 Fresh oil bonds to tide over PSU loss

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 SOME RELIEF

 New Delhi, Aug. 29: The finance ministry has agreed to issue fresh oil bonds to bear some of the losses state-run oil companies have had to suffer on account of higher oil prices in global markets.

 At a meeting held yesterday, petroleum minister Murli Deora is believed to have extracted a promise from finance minister P. Chidambaram on this issue.

 The finance minister has, in principle, agreed to issue oil bonds worth Rs 19,000 crore to compensate for over Rs 55,000 crore in under-recoveries by oil companies on account of lower prices they charge for diesel, kerosene and cooking gas. 

 The petroleum ministry has also sought a waiver of 10 per cent customs duty and 16 per cent excise duty on the kerosene sold in the open market. This, it has argued, will help ease the subsidy burden being borne by oil PSUs. 

 The duty waiver on open market kerosene will reduce its cost price to Rs 25-30 at current rate from Rs 35-36 a litre with taxes. The actual sale price of kerosene is about Rs 9-10 a litre.

 Crude oil prices have touched a record $78 a barrel this month and India imports more than 70 per cent of its crude oil requirement.

 Deora has already informed Chidambaram that state-run refiners Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum were losing Rs 195 crore a day on account of selling petrol, diesel, domestic cooking gas (LPG) and kerosene below the cost price. 

 The petroleum ministry had earlier approached the cabinet committee of economic affairs seeking its approval for an appropriate increase in the prices of petrol, diesel, kerosene and LPG.

 The ministry wants at least one-third of the projected Rs 55,000 crore under-realisation on fuel sale this fiscal be met through the issue of oil bonds or discounted debt. 

 However, the government is wary of adding to its huge debt kitty. Price rise too is usually unpopular. In recent state elections, the ruling Congress-led alliance fared badly because the rate of inflation was ruling firm at that time.

 However, with inflation now under control and no Assembly elections in the offing coupled with a good monsoon, officials said this could be an opportune moment for the government to hike fuel prices even if marginally.

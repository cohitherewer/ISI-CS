 Buzz gets louder

 Mumbai, March 4: The Ruias plan to expand their presence in telecom retail, which will be spearheaded by Essar Telecom Retail. 

 We are a long-term player. The group is committed to telecom retail and we are targeting all sections of consumers. My target is to sell a million handsets every month over the next six to eight months. I am confident that we could get a 10 per cent market share within the next three years, Essar Telecom CEO amp; director Rajiv Agarwal said. This will involve a total investment of $250-300 million, Agarwal added.

 Essar Telecoms chain of multi-service outlets, called The MobileStore, is present in eight cities. The company plans to have more than 2,500 outlets over the next three years in 600 cities.

 The company will roll out these stores in three formats. These include large stores spread over 1,000-1,500 sq ft, medium ones spread over 800-1,000 sq ft and the compact version in the 200-500 sq ft range. 

 It is also eyeing a shop-in-shop format for the malls.

 Agarwal added that while Calcutta also fits into its scheme of things, the plan is to have 25 stores over the next few months. Around 15 stores are in the process of being rolled out.

 The MobileStore has categorised its mobile device offerings into four consumer segments business, lifestyle, fun and value. While consumers can download ringtones, games and songs, the outlets will also offer digital cameras, landline phones, iPods and direct-to-home (DTH) services.

 Agarwal is optimistic of meeting these targets as the industry is on a growth path. 

 and consumers are looking not only for a wide choice, but also a healthy interaction when he purchases a mobile phone. 

 Close to 140 mobile phones are sold every month and around 7 million new connections are added. Agarwal, however, admitted that margins in telecom retailing were thin and real estate prices were posing a challenge to the business. The company is confident of overcoming this through its reach. Real estate costs may be high in one area, but it could be lower in another, he added.

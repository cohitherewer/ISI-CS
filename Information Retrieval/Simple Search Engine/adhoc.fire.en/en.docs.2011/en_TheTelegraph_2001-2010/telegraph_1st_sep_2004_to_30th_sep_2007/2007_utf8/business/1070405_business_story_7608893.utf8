 Rupee hits 8-year high

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 4: The rupee today breached the 43-mark to touch an eight-year high against the dollar on the back of robust inflow of the US currency and fresh dollar selling by banks which are in a rush to comply with the higher reserve requirements of the RBI.

 After hitting an intra-day high of 42.84 per dollar, the rupee ceded some of its gains, reportedly on RBI intervention, and closed at 43.06 per dollar, slightly higher higher than the previous close of 43.07. 

 Dealers said in addition to the higher inflows of the dollar from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and through foreign direct investment (FDI), an added impetus was provided by RBIs absence in early trades.

 Besides, banks sold dollars to meet the increased reserve requirements of the apex bank which raised the cash reserve ratio (CRR) on Friday last by 50 basis points to 6.50 per cent.

 The rupee was in a stronger territory in early morning trades itself, when it breached the 43 level to touch the eight-year high of 42.84. 

 The Indian currency opened higher at 43.06 per dollar against the overnight close of 43.07, and after hitting the intra-day high, it hovered in the region of 43.90-43.98 per dollar. 

 It is for the first time since June 1999 that the rupee breached the 43 mark against the dollar. 

 Analysts said that the central bank was initially absent in the market. 

 An analyst with a private bank said the RBI was not intervening actively as by buying dollars it would have raised the supply of rupee which would have stoked inflation. However, the rupee surrendered much of its gains, which dealers attributed to intervention by the RBI.

 Analysts said the outlook on the rupee was bullish as dollar inflows were high, while corporates were borrowing more from abroad on account of the high interest rates at home.

 A treasury chief of a private bank said future trends will be determined by the RBIs strategy in the forex market. 

 We could see an intervention from the central bank from time to time. But it will not be a major one, he added.

 Mumbai, June 25 (PTI): HSBC Ltds India branches have reported a 64 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 846 crore for the year ended March 31 against Rs 515 crore in the previous year.

 The continuing growth in profit has been driven by strong performances across business lines. The additional investment in the Indian operations is a clear reflection of the HSBC groups desire to aggressively grow its Indian franchise, HSBC India group general manager and CEO Naina Lal Kidwai said.

 In 2006-07, HSBC invested Rs 1,437 crore in the Indian branches, comprising a fresh infusion of Rs 904 crore as well as profit retention of Rs 533 crore. This is on top of the Rs 523 crore reinvested in the bank during 2005-06.

 The banks capital adequacy ratio is 11.06 per cent on March 31 compared with 10.61 per cent in the previous year.

 The total income of the bank rose 51 per cent to Rs 4,720 crore from Rs 3,130 crore in 2005-06. Total assets increased 47 per cent to Rs 54,987 crore from Rs 37,473 crore in the previous year.

 The Bank of Americas Indian operations has clocked a 24 per cent increase in revenues at Rs 674.4 crore, while profit after tax was up 35 per cent at Rs 195 crore for the year ended March 31.

 Non-interest revenue rose 23 per cent to Rs 244.3 crore from Rs 198.3 crore, driven by enhanced revenues from multiple client services.

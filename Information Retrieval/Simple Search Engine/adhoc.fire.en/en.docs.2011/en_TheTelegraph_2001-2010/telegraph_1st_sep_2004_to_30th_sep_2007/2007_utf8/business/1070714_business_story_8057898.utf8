 Meet to review BSNL tender

 New Delhi, July 13: State-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) will hold a meeting on Monday to review the Rs 27,000-crore GSM tender for which Ericsson and Nokia were shortlisted.

 Various options will be considered in Mondays board meeting, including continuing with the existing tender, limiting it to 2G lines or beginning afresh, said S.D. Saxena, director (finance) of BSNL.

 BSNL, struggling to cut the delay in its mobile expansion plan, has also sought legal advice on the entire issue. We will come out with something acceptable to all parties, said Saxena.

 According to sources, the possibility of scrapping the entire tender and initiating rebidding is remote. 

 The Rs 27,000-crore cellular infrastructure tender was the outcome of a year-long process. Swedish company Ericsson had emerged the lowest bidder at $107 per line, followed by Nokia of Finland, which had bid at $176 per line.

 However, telecom minister A. Raja had stalled the execution of the contract by insisting that BSNL renegotiate the tender price and bring it down to below $100 from $107 a line. He argued it was paying substantially more for the equipment than another state-run firm, MTNL.

 Motorola was not the lowest bidder in the tender and its price of $69 to MTNL cannot be compared to our contract as MTNLs was a much smaller contract and ours is huge and we have also inserted many value-added advanced features in our equipment contract which was not included in the MTNL deal, said sources.

 Raja has now suggested that BSNL should initiate a financial re-bidding with all the five bidders Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia, Siemens and ZTE and finalise fresh technical specifications for the tender. The minister has also sought clarifications from the PSU as to why Motorola was barred from participating in BSNLs tender. 

 In March 2005, BSNL invited tenders for 45.5 million GSM lines. Ericsson and Nokia emerged the two lowest bidders. Motorola was disqualified as BSNL said it had failed to meet some technical specifications. Motorola challenged the decision in a court but withdrew its case in April.

 Earlier this week, employees of BSNL went on a days strike to protest the delay in finalising the deal, which they said was vital for the companys future.

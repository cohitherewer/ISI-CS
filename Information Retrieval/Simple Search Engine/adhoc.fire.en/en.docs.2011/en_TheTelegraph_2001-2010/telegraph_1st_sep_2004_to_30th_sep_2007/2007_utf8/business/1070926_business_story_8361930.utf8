 Mukesh moment in market march

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 25: Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani today became the first person in the country with a net worth of more than Rs 2 trillion as a booming stock market pushed the value of his shareholding in various group firms.

 Ambanis cumulative wealth rose to Rs 2,04,945 crore at the close of todays trading, consolidating his position as the richest businessman in India. 

 Younger brother Anil stood at second position with a net worth of Rs 1,17,710 crore, taking a marginal lead over realty giant DLFs K.P. Singh, who has a net worth of Rs 1,15,225 crore.

 On the BSE, the sensex was within striking distance of 17000. 

 The index, which hovered between 16928.02 and 16676.98 points, finally settled at a life-time high of 16899.54, a jump of 53.71 points or 0.32 per cent.

 Oil and gas stocks drove the market to new highs today. RIL led with a rise of Rs 45.30 to close at Rs 2,399.60. 

 News of the impending issue of bonds to state-owned oil refining companies helped the BSE oil amp; gas index gain 126.34 points to settle at 9777.51.

 The S amp;P CNX Nifty oscillated between 4953.90 and 4878.15 points before finishing at 4938.85, a growth of 6.65 points or 0.13 per cent over Mondays 4932.20.

 The upsurge could mainly be attributed to the robust fund flows and adequate liquidity in the system. Its difficult to predict whether the market would touch 17000 tomorrow or not, but the level would definitely be achieved this week, said Manish Sonthalia, vice-president of Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

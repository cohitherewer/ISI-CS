 VIVEK NAIR

 Fiat group chief executive Sergio Marchionne in Istanbul on Thursday. 

 Istanbul, May 3: Fiat Auto will launch the Linea in India by the middle of next year. The Italian carmaker plans to sell close to 2.80 lakh Lineas globally by 2012, of which close to 60,000 are expected to be sold in India. The Linea, a C-plus segment car, was launched here today.

 The mid-sized sedan will be introduced in phases in other countries beginning with Europe and followed by the Americas and Asia. After Turkey, it will hit the roads in Germany, Romania, Brazil and Taiwan. It will be launched in Russia, China and India in 2008. 

 The Linea will be produced at the Ranjangaon unit near Pune, which is a joint venture between Tata Motors and Fiat Auto. The Italian auto firm is also considering making the unit an export hub for nations that have a demand for right-hand drive vehicles.

 Sergio Marchionne, CEO of the Fiat group, spoke highly of the partnership with the Tatas. I like Tata (Ratan Tata), I like the organisation, I like the way they operate, he said. Marchionne was also optimistic about Indias potential.

 The Linea will compete with Toyotas Corolla in India. 

 Fiat is also adopting an aggressive pricing strategy for the Linea. Officials said though the Linea would cost between 13,000 euros and 18,000 euros in Germany, this is around 20 per cent less than that charged by its competitors. 

 Though the pricing strategy for India is yet to be worked out, sources said it could be as aggressive as seen for the Palio Stile.

 India is an important market for us The positioning (in terms of price) will be in the same competitive manner as we do for other markets, Luca De Meo, CEO of Fiat Auto, added. 

 Fiats Grande Punto is also set to make a debut in the country. Officials said the company would gradually introduce its other models.

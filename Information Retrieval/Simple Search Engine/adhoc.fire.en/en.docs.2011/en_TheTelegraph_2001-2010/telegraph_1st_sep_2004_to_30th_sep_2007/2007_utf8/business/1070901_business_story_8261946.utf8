 GE finance arm plans rights issue

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 31: GE Capital Transportation Financial Services Ltd, the non-banking finance company (NBFC), is planning a rights issue to boost its capital adequacy ratio.

 The company today informed stock exchanges that it would hold a board meeting on September 7 to consider a fresh issue of equity shares on a rights basis. The company needs to raise funds to meet capital-to-risk weighted assets of 10 per cent, as prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India for systematically important non-deposit taking non-banking finance companies. 

 The apex bank issued a notification to this effect in December last year.

 The company, which is into commercial vehicle financing, was earlier known as SRF Finance Ltd. 

 In 1997, GE Capital Services reached an agreement with SRF and its associates to acquire a majority stake in the company. GE Capital Services India is a wholly owned subsidiary of the US-based GE Capital Services. 

 The Foreign Investment Promotion Board subsequently approved GE Capitals plans to make an open offer for hiking its stake in SRF Finance Ltd to 100 per cent from 85 per cent. However, the board imposed a condition that GE Capital would have to divest a 15 per cent stake in the company to domestic shareholders in three years. 

 GE Capital had said it wanted to temporarily hike its stake to 100 per cent to restructure SRF Finance and bring down its losses.

 GE Capital Transportation Financial Services reported an operating income of around Rs 103 crore in 2006.

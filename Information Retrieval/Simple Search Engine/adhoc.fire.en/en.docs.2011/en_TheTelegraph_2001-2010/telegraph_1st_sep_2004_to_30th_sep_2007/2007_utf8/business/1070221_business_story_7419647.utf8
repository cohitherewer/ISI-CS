 Gartner sees 16% rise in IT outlay

 Mumbai, Feb. 20 (PTI): India Inc expects a 16.2 per cent rise in its IT expenditure in 2007 against a 3.2 per cent rise expected in the rest of the world, consulting firm Gartner has said in a study.

 IT investment is at its highest after 2000 and is good for the Indian companies, Gartner vice-president and research director Andrew Rowsell-Jones said.

 However, he warned that with rapid growth in sectors like retail, companies should be wary of selection and implementation of technology.

 The estimates are part of the global survey titled Creating Enterprise Leverage: the 2007 CIO Agenda, which was released by Gartner here today.

 He added the top three motivators for the IT expenditure by Indian companies would be entering newer markets, increasing revenue growth and improving their global competitiveness.

 On the other hand, the companies in the rest of the world have their priority set on improving business processes, reducing operational cost and increasing customer relation. 

 On priority for technology adoption, India and the rest of the world has business intelligence and enterprise resource planning as the top two priorities, Rowsell-Jones said.

 However, in India, security factor has emerged as the third important technology focus, whereas globally the security feature is far lower in priority.

 This is generally because of the growing concerns of corporate governance and the thrust of the Indian companies to achieve world standards in security features, he observed.

 As an advice to Indian CIOs, the Gartner vice-president said they should focus on understanding the business scenario, identify skill and quality through efforts to recruit and retain talent, focusing on information systems processes and thrust on technological excellence.

 NCAER ups growth forecast

 New Delhi, Aug. 11 (PTI): Economic think tank ncaer has raised the forecast for the countrys economic growth this fiscal to 8.53 per cent on the back of good corporate performance and expectations of a higher growth in the farm sector.

 The revised forecast places the gdp growth at 8.53 per cent compared with the previous forecast of 8.3 per cent. Higher growth has been largely because of agriculture and industry, ncaer said in its quarterly review.

 Expectations of a better monsoon and impact of higher capital inflows have led to revised growth estimates for these two sectors, it said.

 Ncaers estimate comes days after the International Monetary Fund raised the GDP forecast to 9 per cent in 2007.

 In slow lane 

 New Delhi, Aug. 9: Overall automobile sales in the country declined 6.36 per cent in July as those of motorcycles continued to slide. Scooters and passenger cars, however, posted a double-digit growth.

 According to figures released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), overall domestic vehicle sales dipped to 683,684 units in July this year from 730,194 in the same month last year.

 The decline was mainly on account of the continued slide in motorcycle sales. Around 375,004 motorcycles were sold in July 2007 against 453,152 in the year-ago period, registering a dip of 17.25 per cent.

 The motorcycle segment has been hit hard not only by the unavailability of credit from banks for financing but also because of the lack of new models to excite the market, said industry experts.

 Domestic passenger car sales, however, grew 11.18 per cent to 89,548 units from 80,543 units in the corresponding period a year ago.

 Scooter sales during the month grew 14.81 per cent to 87,830 units against 76,495 units in the same month last year. Total two-wheeler sales were, however, down 9.95 per cent at 503,356 units compared with 558,982 sold in the year-ago period.

 Sales of commercial vehicles during the month were up marginally by 2.53 per cent at 33,496 units against 32,670 units in the corresponding month a year ago, said SIAM.

 Two-wheeler market leader Hero Honda suffered a 14.49 per cent decline in sales during July this year at 186,848 units against 218,515 in the same month last year.

 Rival Bajaj Auto too suffered a 17.2 per cent dip in sales at 116,305 units against 140,465 in the year-ago period. The sales of TVS Motor Co also dipped 41.3 per cent to 35,237 units from 60,031 last year.

 Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India continued its strong performance in the scooter segment and posted a 27.11 per cent growth at 51,062 units against 40,170 in the same month last year.

 The passenger cars segment grew mainly because of market leader Maruti Udyog, which posted a 20.24 per cent increase in sales at 45,101 units against 37,508 in the same month last year.

 Of the 13 manufacturers, six companies, including Hyundai Motor India, Tata Motors Limited and Honda Siel Cars India, reported a decline in sales.

 While Hyundai Motor saw a decline of 7.38 per cent at 14,981 units (16,175 units), Tata Motors sales slipped 5.79 per cent to 13,688 units (14,530 units) in the month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Out of form

 The new tax return forms are anything but simple, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 Albert Einstein once said, The hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax. 

 Income tax is a difficult subject and tax authorities make it more daunting by coming up with tax return forms that are hard to comprehend. 

 The return forms introduced for the assessment year 2007-08 (that is for income earned in the financial year 2006-07) are confusing compared with the earlier Saral Form 2 and Naya Saral Form 2D, which one could use till last year. 

 Consultants gain

 Taxpayers will find it difficult to fill up the forms without the assistance of an expert tax consultant or a tax return preparer. Even these experts have raised their fees by at least 15 per cent as they expect more clients now. 

 There are too many categories. Individual taxpayers will have a hard time deciding which form to fill, how to fill, which figure to fill and in which column. Hence, they will have to depend on tax professionals/tax preparers more than before, said V.K. Subramani, a practising chartered accountant.

 Four forms

 There are four forms ITR-1, ITR-2, ITR-3 and ITR-4 for taxpayers who do not maintain books of accounts like a business entity. Taxpayers will have to provide details of all their large value transactions, including credit cards, and savings and investments for the financial year preceding the assessment year. 

 Exempted income

 Details of income that are exempt under section 10 of the Income Tax Act and are not included in the total income for calculation of tax liability will have to be included too. For example, income from agriculture, interest income from the Public Provident Fund, post office savings account, RBI Relief Bond and deposit schemes for retiring government and PSU employees will have to be reported. Taxpayers will, therefore, have to calculate and provide details of income that are actually tax-exempt. 

 Spend list

 One will also have to report specified transactions carried out during the financial year. These transactions include: 

 Cash deposit of Rs 10 lakh or more in a savings account in a year

 Credit card payments exceeding Rs 2 lakh in a year

 Investments of Rs 2 lakh or more in mutual funds

 Purchase of bonds or debentures worth Rs 5 lakh or more 

 Acquisition of shares worth Rs 1 lakh or more

 Sale or purchase of immovable property worth Rs 30 lakh or more

 Purchase of RBI bonds worth Rs 5 lakh or more 

 The tax authorities already get the information from agencies such as banks, post offices, mutual funds and stock brokers. Taxpayers have now been asked to disclose their high-value transactions and savings so that the tax department can reconcile their figures with those provided by the agencies. 

 However, individual taxpayers dont have to give details of cash balances with him/her. These forms dont allow you to completely do away with TDS certificates and documents for claiming tax deductions, but you are saved the trouble of attaching supporting documents with the return. 

 Which one is right?

 The new ITR series creates more confusion when it comes to choosing the right form for filing the returns. 

 Under the new series, individuals having income from salary, pension and interest will have to furnish their returns in form ITR-1, which is the simplest (two-page) among the eight new forms notified for the assessment year 2007-08. Again, ITR-1 comes in two versions. 

 However, only a few taxpayers will be eligible to furnish their returns in form ITR-1. Individuals having income from salary and pension and other income from house property, short-term or long-term capital gains or those clubbing the income of his/her spouse or minor children will have to submit ITR-2 that runs through six pages of complex disclosure requirements.

 Individuals having income from business or profession will have to file their returns either in ITR-4 or ITR-3, depending on whether the business is proprietary or not. 

 Pulitzer-winner US novelist Herman Wouk was right when he said: Income tax returns are the most imaginative fiction being written today. Our tax authorities have provided us with eight such options.

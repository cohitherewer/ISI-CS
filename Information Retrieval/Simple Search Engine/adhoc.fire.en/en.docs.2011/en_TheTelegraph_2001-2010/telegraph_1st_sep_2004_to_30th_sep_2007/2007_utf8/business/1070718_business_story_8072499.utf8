 Calcutta, July 17: Birla Corporation Ltd, the MP Birla group flagship, plans to become a 10-million-tonne cement company by 2010.

 Company chairman Rajendra S. Lodha said at the 87th annual general meeting today that Birla Corp was looking at a greenfield plant of 3mt, calling for an investment of Rs 1,200 crore.

 We have a strong balancesheet, robust cash flow and a low debt equity. We can leverage these for the expansion, Lodha said after the AGM.

 The current capacity of the company is 5.25mt. It earns 92 per cent of the turnover from the cement business.

 The capacity is being raised to 7mt through a brownfield expansion at Satna, Madhya Pradesh, and Chanderia, Rajasthan, by 2008-09.

 Lodha said he was open to acquisitions if there was an opportunity.

 We do not want to put up capacity and then face a glut. The focus is more on brownfield expansion since the cost is much lower than that required for a new unit, he said.

 According to Lodha, the company is ready to take drastic steps if small divisions jute, auto trim, vinoleum, steel foundry do not perform. The same will hold true for the joint ventures.

 AllBank gets ready for cash chase

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, July 12: Allahabad Bank plans to raise Rs 500 crore in debt as part of its tier II capital to maintain its capital adequacy ratio (CAR) above 12 per cent. The bank, which is present overseas, will have to comply with Basel II norms from March next year.

 We have a headroom for raising Rs 1,600 crore in tier II (debt) capital Rs 650 crore in lower tier II and Rs 950 crore in upper tier II. However, we may raise Rs 500 crore before September to maintain the CAR above 12 per cent for 2007-08. We will need this to comply with the risk provisioning requirements under the Basel II norms, Allahabad Bank chairman and managing director A. C. Mahajan said after signing an agreement with Franklin Templeton Investments (India) here today to sell the latters mutual fund products. 

 The bank now has a CAR of 12.6 per cent. But this will come down when it starts complying with the risk provisioning requirements of Basel II norms.

 The city-based bank is currently selling schemes of UTI Mutual Fund, Reliance Mutual Fund and Kotak Mutual Fund. Last year, we earned Rs 13 crore by selling third-party products, including insurance schemes. We are targeting Rs 30 crore in the current financial year, Mahajan said.

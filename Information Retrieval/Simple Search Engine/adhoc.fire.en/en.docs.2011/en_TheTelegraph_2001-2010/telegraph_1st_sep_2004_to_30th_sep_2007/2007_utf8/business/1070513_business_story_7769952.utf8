 Calcutta, May 12: Genpact, the countrys largest BPO company, has set the ball rolling for a $600-million (around Rs 2,500 crore) initial public offer on the New York Stock Exchange that will see existing shareholders selling their stake and fresh shares being issued.

 The company has filed a registration statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed initial public offering of its common shares, the company said in a statement.

 In its filing, the company said all the existing shareholders GE, Oak Hill and General Atlantic will be selling their shares in the company, which started as a captive centre for General Electric.

 Genpacts long-term loans stand at $133 million while its short-term debt is $103 million. Morgan Stanley, Citi and JP Morgan are the book-running managers for the issue as well as the underwriters. 

 After the reorganisation, Genpact has been working as an independent company. Now its non-GE business accounts for 25.8 per cent of its revenues.

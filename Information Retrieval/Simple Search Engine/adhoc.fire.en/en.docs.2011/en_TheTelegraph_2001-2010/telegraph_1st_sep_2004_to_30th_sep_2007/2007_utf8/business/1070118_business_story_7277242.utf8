 Wipro profit beats estimates

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 17: Acquisitions and some major deals helped Wipro beat street estimates for the third quarter ended December 31, 2006. The Bangalore-based IT services company today declared a 41 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 765 crore compared with Rs 543.5 crore in the corresponding period last year. On a stand-alone basis, it posted a net profit of Rs 738.9 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 compared with Rs 505.1 crore in the previous year. Analysts had estimated that Wipro will post a net profit of Rs 710 crore.

 However, even as total revenues for the quarter was Rs 3,979 crore, representing a 45 per cent rise, the top management at Wipro are adopting a cautious stance in their forecast for the current period. The company expects revenue to rise to around $685 million in the current quarter from the global IT business. Analysts also warn that an appreciating rupee could crimp the companys margins. During the third quarter, rising wages and an appreciating rupee had affected Wipros margins. 

 Chairman Azim Premji said, We have had another satisfying quarter. Our global IT business delivered good volume growth, primarily driven by robust performance of our energy and utilities vertical, technology infrastructure services and enterprise application services. Continuing their good momentum, our financial services and retail businesses delivered more than 50 per cent year-on-year growth.

 On the operations front, the company brought down its attrition rates in both the IT and BPO businesses. 

 Chief financial officer Suresh Senapaty said Wipros global IT services amp; products revenue was $640.5 million in the third quarter, which was ahead of its own guidance of $633 million.

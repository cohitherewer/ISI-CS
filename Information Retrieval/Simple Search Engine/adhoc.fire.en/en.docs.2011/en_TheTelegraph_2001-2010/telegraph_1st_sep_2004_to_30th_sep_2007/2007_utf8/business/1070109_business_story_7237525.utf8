 New Delhi, Jan. 8: With just weeks to go for the budget, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today hinted at withdrawing tax exemptions and introducing a less restrictive regime in foreign exchange.

 In the long run, our tax regime should not have too many exemptions, which make tax administration an unnecessarily complex exercise, vulnerable to misuse, Singh said at the annual general meeting of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 The Prime Minister also urged Indian business to gear up to get integrated with the economies of South Asia. 

 He also promised a more relaxed foreign exchange regime. As we gradually integrate India into the global financial system and gain confidence in our economys ability, we will gradually move into a less restrictive forex regime, Singh said.

 Last year, an RBI panel on capital account convertibility, under S.S. Tarapore, prepared a roadmap for full convertibility over the next five years in three phases.

 The rupee is convertible on the current account since 1994 but is not fully convertible on the capital account. The recommendations of the Tarapore committee are a step in this direction, mixing caution with optimism, Singh said. The government and the RBI have announced steps to free the rupee, after the committee released its recommendations.

 Singh said inadequate infrastructure was a hurdle to sustained growth. There has been robust expansion in the last few years, but capacities have got stretched which might prevent the economy from attaining a growth rate of more than 10 per cent, he added. Be it power, port capacity or supply of skilled manpower a variety of supply bottlenecks are holding the growth rate back, he said. 

 Singh said it was the governments responsibility to ease the supply constraints. India needs an investment of Rs 1,50,000 crore in the next five years to improve infrastructure and raise the output in industry and farms. 

 A government panel has said foreign funds to the tune of Rs 7,200 crore were necessary, since the social sector, such as education and health, needs heavy investment.

 Singh said there was a need to reform the power sector. A meeting of chief ministers next month would prepare strategies to remove bottlenecks, particularly the viability of distribution companies. 

 It is my solemn assurance that the power sector will receive the priority attention of our government, he said.

 He said a higher growth and a buoyant market were important, but added we have to sustain a much higher rate of investment, keep inflation under control, generate more employment, impart an element of dynamism to our agriculture and wage a decisive war against poverty, ignorance and disease.

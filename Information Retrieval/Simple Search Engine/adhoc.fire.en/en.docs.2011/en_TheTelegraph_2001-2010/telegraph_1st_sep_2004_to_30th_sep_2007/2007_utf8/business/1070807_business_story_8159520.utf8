 ItzCash draws up blueprint for growth

 ANIRUDH LASKAR 

 Mumbai, Aug. 6: Cash card outfit ItzCash will increase its number of franchises to about 5,000 by next year from 3,000 now. 

 The company said it would invest over Rs 12 crore in promotional and advertising campaigns and expected to garner revenues of Rs 1,200 crore by next year.

 We have collected revenues of Rs 600 crore this year and expect to double the figure by next fiscal. We plan to enter hundreds of towns, Shekher Shrivastava, vice- president marketing of ItzCash told The Telegraph. 

 ItzCashs cash card is different from conventional credit and debit cards. 

 The card can be used almost like hard currency and comes with a range of online and manual payment options such as online shopping, mobile bill payment, buying from retail stores, playing online games and booking railway and airline tickets.

 Almost all transactions through the cards are interest and tax-free unlike credit cards. 

 ItzCash cards come in denominations of Rs 100, Rs 200, Rs 300, Rs 500, Rs 1,000, Rs 3,000, Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 with an expiry period of one year from the date of purchase. 

 We end up paying a transaction charge of about 1.8 per cent while booking railway tickets through a credit card. On the other hand, we pay a transaction charge of just 1.5 per cent while using ItzCash card for railway bookings, which is the only kind of transaction where we have kept an additional charge over the actual cost, Shrivastava added. 

 Sources said almost 20 per cent of online railway bookings are done through ItzCash cards. 

 Around 6 million Indian customers are using cash cards now. 

 Most of them use the cards to pay utility bills and book tickets online. 

 The cards are available in almost 1 lakh retail outlets across 400 towns. Shrivastava said ItzCash would enter 300 cities by next year. 

 The cash card market in the country is growing at a rate of almost 200 per cent every year. The cards potential in the country is huge because of the simplicity of transactions. We see the business growing and plan to have 6 lakh retail outlets by 2010, Shrivastava said. 

 ItzCash has tied up with 3,000 website merchants and all the airlines in the country except Air Deccan. 

 The company is in talks with Air Deccan.

 SAIL in cement venture

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, March 21: State-run Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) today signed a shareholders agreement with Jaiprakash Associates Limited (JAL) to set up a joint venture company.

 According to the agreement, SAIL will hold a minority stake of 26 per cent in the joint venture, while JAL will own the rest.

 The company will set up plants to produce 2.2 million tonnes of cement at Bhilai, Chhattisgarh and Satna, Madhya Pradesh, by using slag generated at Bhilai Steel Plant and limestone from SAILs mines at Satna.

 The clinker and partial grinding unit will be located in Satna and we will make slag cement in Bhilai in Chhatisgarh, said Rahul Kumar, chief operating officer of JAL. 

 The project will cost approximately Rs 600 crore and is expected to be completed in three years. The board of the company will have members from both firms in proportion of their equity. 

 Speaking on the occasion, SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta said, This is the largest joint venture that SAIL is embarking on with a partner from the private sector. Steel and cement being the prime inputs for infrastructure development of the country, we are happy for our association with the cement industry. 

 The yet-to-be-named joint venture will cater to consumers in the eastern and northeastern regions from its unit.

 The venture is being formed as a part of the companys sustained eco-friendly efforts to explore the alternative mode of slag disposal at its Bhilai steel plant. It will also enable the plant to utilise the slag generated in its blast furnaces and also the idle assets of Satna mines.

 While SAIL will offer one million tonnes of granulated slag annually and provide land at Bhilai and Satna on lease to the joint venture company, JAL will organise debt and ensure project execution.

 JAL will also be responsible for project and operations of the joint venture. 

 Meanwhile, Kumar added, Jaiprakash would also participate when bids for similar ventures are invited for SAILs Bokaro steel plant. 

 While SAIL is Indias largest steel producer, Jaiprakash is the fifth largest cement producer in India.

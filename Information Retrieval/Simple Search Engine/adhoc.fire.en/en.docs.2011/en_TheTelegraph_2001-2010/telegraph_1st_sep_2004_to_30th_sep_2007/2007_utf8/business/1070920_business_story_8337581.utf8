 Calcutta, Sept. 19: The Jharkhand government should give a part of the prized Chiria iron ore reserves to Steel Authority of India Ltd immediately, Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan said today.

 The state must allocate one billion tonnes of iron ore from Chiria to SAIL without delay and sign an agreement for another one billion tonnes for SAILs use in the future, he added.

 He was speaking at a programme organised by MSTC India in Calcutta.

 Paswan criticised Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda for favouring private companies.

 Chiria has 3 billion tonnes of reserves. The state can give 1 billion tonnes to anyone it likes, Paswan said.

 ArcelorMittal has been eyeing the Chiria reserves for sometime. However, the Jharkhand government and SAIL are locked in a legal battle over the reserves. Madhu Koda had offered the Ankua reserves to ArcelorMittal. The company refused Ankua, saying the reserves were unsuitable for mining.

 Mittal Steel had signed an MoU with the Jharkhand government in October 2005 for a 12mt steel plant. It had demanded a lease to mine 600mt over a period of 30 years.

 Other private steel makers are also interested in Chiria.

 Paswans comment follows an admission by the Jharkhand government and SAIL that an out-of-court settlement is on the cards.

 SAIL has proposed to set up another plant in Jharkhand, to ensure the ore from Chiria stays at its disposal. It runs the Bokaro Steel Plant in the state now.

 The ore from Chiria is crucial for IISCO Steel Plant at Burnpur in Bengal. SAIL is spending Rs 10,000 crore to expand capacity at the plant.

 Paswan had earlier proposed a formula for sharing Chiria reserves but this is first time he criticised Koda for being soft on the private sector.

 SAIL uses the captive mining route to meet its requirements of iron ore. In 2006-07, the company produced 17mt of ore. It hopes to reach 19mt during this year and 29.2mt by 2010-11, when it will nearly double its production to 26mt.

 Chiria, which has the largest deposit of high-grade iron ore, is crucial to SAILs expansion plan.

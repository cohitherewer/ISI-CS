 Cement import norms relaxed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 4: The government today liberalised cement import norms to bring down the price of the commodity.

 Cement import would be freely allowed unlike in the past when only end users enjoyed this facility.

 The condition that imports must be on a continuous basis has also been done away with. Against the backdrop of severe scarcity of the commodity and rising prices, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade has notified these changes, which will remain in force till March 31 next year.

 However, the imports will be subject to the condition that cement is procured from a manufacturing facility that is certified by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).

 BIS has already certified manufacturing facilities of 11 companies in Bangladesh, Bhutan and the UAE.

 The liberalisation of import norms comes a day after finance minister P. Chidambaram reduced the excise burden on cement. 

 Yesterday, Chidambaram announced an ad valorem duty of 12 per cent on cement if the price is more than Rs 190 per 50-kg bag. 

 This years budget had proposed a specific duty of Rs 600 per tonne. The duty remained unchanged at Rs 350 per tonne for cement sold below Rs 190 per bag.

 According to the finance minister, the partial rollback will reduce taxes by Rs 7 per bag. Its my expectation that the industry will respond positively and reduce the price of cement, he had said.

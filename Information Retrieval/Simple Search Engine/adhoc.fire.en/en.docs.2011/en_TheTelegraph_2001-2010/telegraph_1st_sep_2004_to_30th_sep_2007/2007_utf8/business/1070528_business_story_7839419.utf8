 Mittal extols retail virtues

 Mittal: Ambitious plans

 New Delhi, May 27: Organised retail can boost the growth rate in agriculture by connecting farmers with markets, newly elected CII president Sunil Mittal said in an interview to The Telegraph. Mittal, who is the chairman of Bharti Enterprises, is entering the retail sector in collaboration with global leader Wal-Mart.

 The government is keen to raise the growth rate in agriculture to 3-4 per cent from 2 per cent. This can be done by linking up with farmers. It is necessary to increase farm investments and step up the use of technology. 

 Companies are developing technologies for farmers and investing in supply chains and organised food retail. There has also been a surge in private investment in the farm sector because of the increased demand for food and other commodities. 

 The apex chamber has outlined a five-point agenda for the farm sector. This includes amending state laws on agricultural marketing and allowing companies to buy directly from farmers. The government is also expected to make major policy announcements for the farm sector.

 Mittal also supported Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs views on lavish living by top executives. The message should be taken in the right spirit as the Prime Minister was concerned about the inequality in the country, he said.

 He (the Prime Minister) meant the ostentatious display of wealth should be avoided. I dont think the Prime Minister said profits were bad. In fact, he praised the industry for the high growth rate. He had said while you earn profits, you could help the government in nation building. I think that is fine, he said. 

 The CII chief said he did not believe that companies were involved in corporate social responsibility schemes only to avoid taxes.

 I agree that philanthropy cannot be solely for reaping fiscal and tax benefits. Every nation builds an incentive mechanism for corporations to undertake voluntary social work. 

 But having said that, I do not think that fiscal incentives should be the only reason for implementing such programmes, he said. 

 At the CII annual general meeting on Thursday the Prime Minister said companies should undertake social activities for the greater good of the nation and not just for tax benefits. Mittal was concerned over corruption in the economy. Simplifying regulation and processes are the best way to address the menace. There should be more use of technology and minimum human interface. This would go a long way in reducing the problem.

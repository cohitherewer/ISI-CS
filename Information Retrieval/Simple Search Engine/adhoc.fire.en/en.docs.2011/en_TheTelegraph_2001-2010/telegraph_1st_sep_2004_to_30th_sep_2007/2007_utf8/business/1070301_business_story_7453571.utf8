 Just funds wont do the trick for farms

 GUEST COLUMN - Anup Sinha

 The Union Budget for 2007-08 does not contain any surprises. Indeed, sensible budgets should not contain too many surprises. 

 This year the larger political question for the budget was the issue of inflationary pressures building up in the Indian economy, especially in essential food items. 

 According to modern macroeconomic wisdom, keeping inflation in check is the task of an independent central bank. 

 Fiscal policy is supposed to be more innocuous: keeping essential public spending going while ensuring that public debt does not go out of control and tax revenue is raised with minimum economic distortions. 

 Therefore, expecting the finance minister to pull miracles out of the budgetary hat may be unfair.

 His job is to ensure that economic growth is enabled, and distributional equity attained according to the priorities of his government. To this limited extent the finance minister has done an adequate job. 

 The budget is normally not the forum for announcing major policy changes. This year, it was politically wise to steer away from policy changes that could be perceived as having short-term social costs. 

 Anyway, the economy did fine last year without any major policy reforms like accelerated disinvestments or changing labour laws. 

 Having appreciated the constraints within which the budget was made this year, a comment on the additional agricultural and rural expenditures is warranted. 

 The finance minister himself mentioned that there is no dearth of schemes and funds, but it is the delivery that is terribly inadequate. 

 The lack of agricultural growth has been persistent, and for a growing economy the demand for agricultural goods, especially food is only to be expected. 

 The official thinking that is reflected in the bewildering array of yojanas and schemes is that adequate credit, irrigation, and good seeds will do the trick. 

 These are important inputs. However, Indian agriculture has reached a point where substantial and sustainable productivity growth is unlikely without significant institutional changes and new technologies. 

 Agriculture may be a priority for funds, but there is no serious debate about how to energise the sector to feed an ever-growing demand.

 The additional one per cent educational cess was easy to anticipate given the commitment to reservations in higher education that the UPA government made earlier. 

 A specific cess makes fiscal sense only if it is temporary. We are not sure how long the cess will stay and at what level. 

 Since the reservations in higher education will entail a one-off transfer, the finance minister has kept the room open for keeping the cess at three per cent by insisting that this was for the reservations issue as well as for secondary education. 

 This budget reflects certain expectations of the finance minister and his team. Since the economy has been growing, and saving and investment has also grown quite fast, the inflationary pressures are only temporary. 

 The economys growth momentum is likely to continue without too much fiscal intervention or incentives. 

 There are significant import options open. Finally, political compulsions of keeping further reforms at bay have not been too costly.

 In the age of integrating markets dominated by the power of global finance, fundamental economic changes are often outside the control of sovereign governments with traditional fiscal and monetary policy instruments. 

 Asset markets are beginning to soften, even in China. Are we insulated enough from the complex dynamics of global markets?

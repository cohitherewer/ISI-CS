 Calcutta, Aug. 24: RPG Cellucom is aiming to garner revenues worth Rs 1,000 crore by 2008-09. The IT and mobile retail chain will open 500 stores nationally by December 2008.

 The retail chain, a partnership between RPG Retail and Cellucom of Dubai, will have 25 stores in Calcutta and 75 in the state.

 We are also open to Cellucom investing in equity as and when foreign direct investment is allowed. The first shop was opened in January 2007 and our format will cover the entire value chain, including shop in shops at malls and high street outlets and part of other lifestyle retail chains, said Sanjiv Goenka, chairman of RPG Cellucom.

 According to Goenka, the chain comes at a time when India is set to have 250 million mobile subscribers by the end of 2007. The mobile market is valued at over Rs 20,000 crore.

 The investment for 500 stores will be around Rs 100 crore. Each will be spread over 300 to 800 sq ft.

 Calcutta is the sixth city where the store was launched. These stores will stock over 200 kinds of products and over 75 different models of phones of Nokia, Motorola, Sony Ericsson, Samsung, HP/Compaq, Toshiba, Lenovo and Acer.

 RPG Retail, which operates through the Spencers brand, is also in talks with international retail majors and is looking at starting a joint venture in a new line of business.

 We are in talks with international companies at present. If everything goes well, you may see us launch another line of business in the next couple of months. It will be a big international tie-up, Goenka added.

 CESC Properties, another group company, is set to start construction of its first mall in the city.

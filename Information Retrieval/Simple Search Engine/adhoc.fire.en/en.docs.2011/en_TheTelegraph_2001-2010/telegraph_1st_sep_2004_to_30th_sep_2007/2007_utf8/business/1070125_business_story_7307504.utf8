 Savers spoilt for deposit choice

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 24: Commercial banks are once again coming out with new deposit products at higher rates of interest to woo the saver. 

 After the State Bank of India (SBI) came up with two such schemes, ICICI Bank and Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) Ltd today joined the rate race. While ICICI announced a new 890-day fixed deposit scheme with a 9 per cent interest rate, IDBI is offering 8.75 per cent on a 600-day term deposit. 

 While these moves reflect the urgency of banks to raise resources to meet strong credit demand, it also marks the good times that seem to have just begun for the depositor. 

 With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expected to winch up the reverse repo rate (benchmark short-term rate at which it mobilises funds from the system) during its review meeting on January 31, deposit rates are all set to move north again. However, on the flip side, a plethora of such schemes of varying maturities and interest rates could also lead to some confusion among depositors. 

 Take the case of ICICI Bank. Apart from announcing an increase in interest rates on fixed deposits across various tenors and amounts in the range of 0.25-1.50 per cent, the countrys largest private sector bank came up with a new product an 890-day fixed deposit at an interest rate of 9 per cent per annum. According to the bank, the scheme bears one of the highest yields in the market and is ideal for customers looking to invest in a mid-term deposit. 

 ICICI Bank official Maninder Singh Juneja said, The bank has increasingly observed keen interest among customers to invest in deposit products. The deposit schemes launched this year have received a great response and we believe that this trend will continue.

 In the 890-day fixed deposit, ICICI Bank customers will earn a yield as high as 9.94 per cent (quarterly compounded). 

 The bank said for all deposits between Rs 15 lakh and Rs 1 crore for a maturity period of over one year, interest rates have been revised upwards by 0.50-1.50 per cent, taking the interest rate to 8.50 per cent. 

 IDBI, on the other hand, decided to launch a 600-day term deposit scheme called IDBI Suvidha Plus Fixed Deposit (ISPFD) at an interest rate of 8.75 per cent. Depositors can park a minimum amount of Rs 10,000 and in multiples of Rs 1,000 thereafter and there is no cap on the quantum of funds that can be parked in the scheme.

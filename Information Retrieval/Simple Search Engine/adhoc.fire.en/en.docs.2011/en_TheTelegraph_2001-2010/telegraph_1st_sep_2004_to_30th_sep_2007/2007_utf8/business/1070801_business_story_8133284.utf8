 Bank deposits to fetch less

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 31: The Reserve Banks decision to raise the cash reserve ratio (CRR) and leave other policy rates unchanged may hurt depositors even as borrowers can expect some relief. Deposit rates are slated to come down but equated monthly instalments on your loans are likely to remain where they are. 

 Just hours after the central bank announced a surprise 50- basis-point hike in CRR in its first-quarter review of the monetary policy for 2007-08, a few nationalised banks reduced their deposit rates. The Bank of Baroda and the Bank of India announced they were bringing down interest rates on one-year deposits by 50 basis points. Both these banks left their lending rates unchanged and senior officials said there were no plans to raise interest rates on home and other loans. 

 Bankers explained that the reduction was on account of two factors. The CRR hike, they said, would impact net interest margins of banks, necessitating a correction in high interest rates offered on deposits. Moreover, unlike in the past, banks are now not paid any interest on the balances kept with the RBI as part of the CRR requirement. 

 Raising money through deposits comes at a cost. But the CRR balances maintained with the RBI are now earning us a zero interest. Had they been deployed in credit, the average yield would have been more than 10 per cent. Therefore, the hike in this ratio will impact banks cost of funds and they will recover this by realigning the interest on term deposits, an executive with a nationalised bank said.

 When credit growth touched 30 per cent and banks needed money to fund the strong demand, they started offering high interest rates on deposits. While some nationalised banks are now offering interest rates of up to 9.5 per cent on deposits, some cooperative banks even offer 10 per cent. Deposits of one-year maturity may stabilise around 9 per cent now. Moreover, despite the CRR hike, funds in the system will not be affected drastically. Therefore, with no immediate funds crunch, there is no reason for banks to keep offering the same interest rate on deposits, the banker added.

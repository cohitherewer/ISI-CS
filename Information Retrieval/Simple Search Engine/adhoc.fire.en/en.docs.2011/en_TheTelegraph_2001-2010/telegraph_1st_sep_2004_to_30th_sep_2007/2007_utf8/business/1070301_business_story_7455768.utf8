 Trust CPM to 

 find fault

 - Budget doesnt serve cause of farmers or the poor, 

 says Left 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: Key government ally CPM today riddled the budget with criticism, despite a Congress assessment that the finance ministers proposals reflected the wish lists of Sonia Gandhi and her allies.

 In the evening, the disappointed Marxists demanded that P. Chidambaram make sizeable increases in the outlay for agriculture, education, health, employment generation, rural development and the public distribution system.

 The government has failed to deliver resources to warrant its rhetoric that the budget serves the cause of a crisis-ridden peasantry, the working people and the poor, the party said. Budget 2007-08 comes as a disappointment in the context of the inflationary crisis affecting the economy.

 The CPM doesnt have a single good word for any aspect of the budget. It has criticised the governments meagre allocation for the social sectors, its lack of concern for the distressed farmers, the paltry increase in food subsidies and the failure to re-impose the capital gains tax.

 The Left is upset with the governments policies that, they say, have led to spiralling inflation. This morning, the government announced a ban on futures trading in wheat and rice a demand the Left had been raising consistently.

 But if the Centre expected a pat from its Marxist allies, its hopes were dashed within hours as Chidambaram unveiled the budget proposals in the Lok Sabha.

 While the ban on futures trading in wheat and rice is welcome, the government has failed to do away with the ad valorem duty structure on petroleum products, (doing) which would have helped bring down fuel prices, the CPM said. It added: The central plan outlay on agriculture has hardly been increased as a proportion of the GDP. No effort has been made to provide price support to the distressed farmers.

 The party was equally critical of the social sector allocations, though it gave a qualified thumbs-up to the proposals on education. But it said the health outlay wasnt enough.

 Nor did it find the allocation for rural employment enough. The number of districts covered under the (rural) employment guarantee scheme has (been) increased from 200 to 330, but the outlay has only been increased from Rs 11,300 crore to Rs 12,000 crore.

 New Delhi, March 8: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today asked public sector companies to look at joint ventures and mergers as part of their growth strategy. He also indicated that the Congress-led government wants the PSUs to go for listing on the bourses.

 Public enterprises also need a strategic vision. They must learn from the private sector and seize opportunities for mergers, acquisitions, amalgamations, takeovers and joint ventures, Singh said at the conference of chief executives of central public sector undertakings.

 He said mergers and acquisitions should be an integral part of their business strategy to create shareholder value, become cost effective, reduce cost of finance and increase their market share.

 I believe that many joint ventures and alliances, both between public enterprises and between public and private enterprises are being worked out, Singh said, adding that such joint ventures and public-private partnerships can help the public sector leverage the private sectors competitive advantages.

 The revitalisation of our public sector is an integral part of our strategy to promote inclusive growth, Singh said. It may be useful for more public enterprises to be listed on the stock exchange, as this would make the board of directors more professional and empower the independent directors, Singh said. 

 Induction of independent directors on the boards of PSUs would ensure greater efficiency in the decision-making processes as well, Singh added. He further said the government and PSUs must pay greater attention to how we identify independent directors.

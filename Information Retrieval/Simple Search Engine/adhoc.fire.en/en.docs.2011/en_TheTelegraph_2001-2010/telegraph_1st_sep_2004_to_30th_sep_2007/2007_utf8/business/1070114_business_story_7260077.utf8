 Sebi not worried over market volatility

 Calcutta, Jan. 13 (PTI): The Securities amp; Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is not worried about volatility in the stock markets, saying the trend was a characteristic of emerging markets. 

 Sebi wholetime director T.C. Nair today said the common apprehension that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) might desert Indian bourses en masse was unfounded. He said it was not possible for all FIIs to make an exit at the same time since it was detrimental to their own interests. We have full confidence in that, he said. 

 At present, there are 135 FIIs in India and the total investment made by them is $55 billion. Nair said it was difficult to say when the markets were going to stabilise. 

 Asked whether the huge quantum of funds flowing into the market was a cause for concern, Nair said it was good for the country. With the boom in the economy, he said this augured well for India. He also said huge money was flowing through the private equity route.

 Speaking at a seminar on Sebi takeover amp; insider trading regulations and compliances with listing agreement, organised by the Institute of Company Secretaries of India here, Nair rued that several companies were not complying with corporate governance guidelines of the market regulator.

 Nair said Sebi would monitor the implementation of the guidelines by the companies so that 100 per cent compliance was adhered to.

 Referring to short-selling by institutions, he said Sebi was planning to allow this as it would boost the market. He said Sebi was discussing the issue and the necessary in-built safeguards were being looked into.

 Sebi would also give permission to BSE and NSE for providing a trading platform for the corporate debt market. BSE had been selected earlier as the reporting platform for this market.

 Referring to the Indian depository receipts (IDRs), he said the response was not very encouraging so far. He said Sebi was considering to remove certain restrictive guidelines. 

 The stock market on Friday scaled a new high, riding on strong growth in industrial production, firm global advices and governments decision to amend the banking regulation act. 

 The 30-share Sensex on Friday opened with a wide gap of nearly 100 points and later surged up to an alltime intratrade high of 14,070.88 before ending at a new closing peak of 14,056.53.

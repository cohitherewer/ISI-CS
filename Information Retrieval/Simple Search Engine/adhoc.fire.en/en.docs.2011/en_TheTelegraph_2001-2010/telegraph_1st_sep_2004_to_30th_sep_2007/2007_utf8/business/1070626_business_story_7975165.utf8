 HLL is now Hindustan Unilever

 OUR BUREAU 

 Mumbai, June 25: Hindustan Lever has received the governments approval to change its name to Hindustan Unilever Ltd. A new corporate identity represented by a new logo will come into effect now.

 The identity symbolises the benefits we bring to our consumers and the communities we work in. Our new identity will help us confidently position ourselves in every aspect of our business, Hindustan Unilever CEO Doug Baillie said.

 The new logo is symbolic of the companys mission of adding vitality to life. It comprises 25 different icons representing the organisation, its brands and the idea of vitality, Hindustan Unilever said in a letter to the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 The shareholders of the company had approved the proposal on May 18.

 In February, the company said the proposed name change would provide optimum balance between maintaining its heritage and synergies of global alignment with the corporate name of Unilever.

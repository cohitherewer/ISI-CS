 Trade optimism laced with caution

 New Delhi, March 12: Even as hectic consultations are underway to salvage the deadlocked Doha round of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations, the director-general of the trade body is hopeful of some progress. 

 The prospects of closing the gaps between positions of different groupings appears more plausible than ever before, Lamy told mediapersons after addressing an international seminar on Saving Doha and Delivering on Development here today. 

 Outside the venue ITC Maurya Sheraton farmers demonstrated and Delhi had woken up to unseasonal rain, not considered a good omen. Agriculture is the most contentious and most opposed aspect of the negotiations. 

 Lamy said several countries had firmed up proposals on the concessions they would make on reduction in agricultural subsidies and tariffs as well as the formula for cut in industrial tariffs. That in itself, he said, was not good enough to conclude the round.

 Lamy said he was disappointed at the slow pace at which the negotiations were proceeding. Many members are getting impatient. Negotiations must kick in at full speed. However, he cautioned against rushing through proposals just to meet deadlines. Completion cannot be at the cost of substance, he said. 

 Side-stepping questions about how hopeful he was about the success of the negotiations, Lamy said he was particularly encouraged by the high level of political engagement and determination, referring to the recent meeting between US President George Bush and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The US, EU, India and Brazil had a major role to play in making the negotiations a success, he said. 

 The timing of the two-day meeting, which brings together several important negotiators from different countries, is significant as trade negotiations to revive the Doha round of negotiations are currently on. Lamy stressed the need for concluding the negotiations by June, when the United States Fast Track Authority expires. The authority enables US representatives to negotiate without having to get Congress approval for every move and hence speeds up negotiations.

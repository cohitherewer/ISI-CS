 Full throttle

 Mumbai, June 6: The UB group today made an open offer to acquire an additional 20 per cent stake in Deccan Aviation Ltd. Kingfisher Radio Ltd, a subsidiary of United Breweries Holdings, made the offer, which comes at a price of Rs 155 per share. 

 This follows the groups move to acquire a 26 per cent stake in Deccan Aviation. UB Holdings has made an offer to public shareholders of Deccan Aviation to acquire 27,094,024 shares. 

 At a price of Rs 155 per share, the group will have to shell out around Rs 420 crore if the offer is accepted by the shareholders. The offer will open on July 25 and close on August 13.

 On May 31, the board of Deccan Aviation approved a preferential issue of up to 3.52 crore shares at a price of Rs 155 each, which constitutes 26 per cent of its post-issue capital, to the UB group. According to the proposal, the group made an upfront payment of Rs 150 crore. The group will have to pay around Rs 396 crore to the company before June 29. The offer is being managed by Edelweiss Capital.

 The UB group today revealed some details of the shareholders agreement it had entered into with Deccan Aviation.

 The group enjoys tag-along rights. If the promoters of Air Deccan sell off more than 5 per cent of shares, UB Group, the acquirer, will have the first right of refusal with respect to such shares. 

 UB Group said Kingfisher Airlines and Air Deccan would gain from the alliance. It said both the airlines have synergies in operations and maintenance, ground handling, increased connectivity, feeder services and distribution penetration. 

 The board of Deccan Aviation will be reconstituted. While half of the board will comprise independent directors, one fourth will be represented by the UB group and an equal number by promoters and shareholders of Deccan Aviation. 

 G.R. Gopinath will be the executive chairman of the board and Vijay Mallya will be appointed as the vice-chairman of the company. 

 After the open offer, the non-promoter shareholding in Deccan Aviation will be about 57.63 per cent of the total paid-up capital of the company.

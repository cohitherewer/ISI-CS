 Monopoly probe into telecom tariff

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practice Commission (MRTPC) has asked its investigative arm the Director General of Investigation and Registration (DGIR) to probe into Bharti Airtel and Vodafones decision to raise tariffs. 

 Anti-monopoly watchdog MRTPC suspects the two companies have formed a cartel and are distorting competition in the market.

 Bharti Airtel refused to say anything on the issue and Vodafone Essar officials were not available for comment on the directive.

 Sources said the MRTPC took initiative following newspaper reports on the price hike. The hikes were almost simultaneous and the commission suspected that it was a coordinated action.

 The commissions action comes days after the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal pulled up the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, the regulator, for not intervening in the matter.

 While hearing a petition by an NGO, the tribunal had said the matter had a direct bearing on consumers. The companies last month raised tariffs for long-distance and local calls, SMS and value-added services. News reports had alleged that while even a small cut in rates was announced with fanfare, the operators refrained from publicising the tariff hike. They only published customary notices. 

 Under Section 10 of the MRTP Act 1969, cartelisation in any industry is prohibited and is a restrictive trade practice as it imposes unjustified burden on consumers. Sources said the commission also noticed that these companies did not inform their customers about the price hike.

 Seven more jewels to join elite public sector club

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 19: The decks have been cleared for seven more PSUs to become navratnas. The seven are Nalco, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Bharat Electronics, National Mineral Development Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation, Power Grid Corporation of India and Power Finance Corporation. 

 The high-level committee under cabinet secretary B.K. Chaturvedi approved the proposals that give the seven greater autonomy, including more freedom on investments. The new entrants have enlarged the list of navratnas to 16 from nine, making the word navratna a misnomer. 

 The first batch of PSUs in this elite club are ONGC, Indian Oil, Bhel, NTPC, SAIL, BPCL, HPCL, GAIL and MTNL. The seven new entrants were previously miniratnas. The PSU to miss out is Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd on technical grounds, though the committee is likely to consider its proposal later, a senior official said. 

 The navratna status will bestow greater financial and administrative autonomy on the boards of these seven PSUs. They will be able to form joint ventures and wholly-owned subsidiaries in India and abroad and invest up to 15 per cent of their net worth in one project within a limit of Rs 1,000 crore.

 The board of directors of the seven PSUs will also decide on mergers and acquisitions, while the upper limit on sanctions for capital expenditure by the board will rise. Besides the cabinet secretary, the apex committee includes representatives from the Planning Commission, finance ministry and the administrative ministry of the PSU concerned. 

 Before going to the apex committee, the case for the PSUs was reviewed by an inter-ministerial committee.

 To be a navratna, a mini-ratna company has to get excellent or very good score three years in a row on the performance parameters set out yearly in the memorandum of understanding with the government.

 Sources said BSNL is likely to join the navratna club next fiscal since it has met the benchmarks for 2004-05 and 2005-06 and is tipped to meet the targets for this fiscal as well.

 For navratna status, a PSU needs to be up to the mark on six parameters set by the department of public enterprises. 

 These include the ratio of manpower cost to cost of production; ratio of net profit to net worth; ratio of profit before interest and tax to turnover; earnings per share; and the performance of the PSU vis-a-vis others in its sector. 

 The scoring is on 100, and a PSU needs to score at least 60. The highest weight of 25 is given to the net profit to net worth ratio followed by the performance of the PSU in its sector. The parameters will be checked for three consecutive years.

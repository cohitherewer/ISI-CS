 Foreign banks to get a boost

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Leeladhar: Optimistic

 Mumbai, March 14: Foreign banks operating in India could be allowed to pick up controlling stakes in domestic private sector banks after 2009. 

 Reserve Bank deputy governor V. Leeladhar has said India will go beyond its WTO commitment of allowing foreign banks to open 12 branches in a year. Foreign banks operating in India as subsidiaries will also be allowed to list and dilute their stake after completing a minimum prescribed period of operation. 

 He was speaking on Indian Financial Sector Reforms at the Annual Washington Conference of the Institute of International Bankers recently. 

 Foreign banks can now operate in India either as branches or as wholly owned subsidiaries. However, all foreign banks in India operate as branches because of the tough regulations associated with subsidiaries. For instance, subsidiaries of foreign banks will have to honour priority sector targets like any other bank in India. 

 Foreign banks are also allowed to acquire stakes in private sector, but in a limited manner. Foreign banks perceive the 10 per cent limit on voting rights as a deterrent. 

 Leeladhar said in the second phase, beyond April 2009, foreign banks will be allowed to acquire up to 74 per cent in a private sector bank in India. 

 During the first phase, between March 2005 and March 2009, foreign banks could either operate through branches or set up wholly owned subsidiaries. For new and existing foreign banks, it is proposed to go beyond the existing WTO commitment of 12 branches in a year, Leeladhar said. 

 In the second phase (post 2009), three interconnected issues would be taken up. First, rules for removal of limitations on wholly owned subsidiaries and treating them on a par with domestic banks will be implemented. 

 Moreover, the wholly owned subsidiaries of foreign banks, on completion of a minimum prescribed period of operation, may be allowed to list and dilute their stake.

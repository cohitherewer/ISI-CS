 Move to cut telecom tariffs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Coming cheaper

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today reduced inter-network connection or port charges for service providers by up to 29 per cent a move to bring down telephone tariffs. Private mobile service providers, however, said it might not have a huge impact on consumers monthly bill.

 Port charges are paid by private cellular service operators to allow their customers make calls to networks of state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL). Since the regulators move will reduce operational costs for operators, Trai expects them to pass on the benefit to consumers.

 However, industry experts feel interconnection charges are applicable only if one is calling from the network of a private cellular service like Airtel to a BSNL number. But if one is calling from an Airtel phone to another Airtel or a Hutch number, interconnection charges dont apply. Therefore, the impact on a consumers telephone bill may not be huge.

 Trais move will reduce the operational costs of a private mobile service provider by only Rs 75-80 crore. This means that on a Re 1 call, the cost would come down by less than 5 paise, which is a negligible reduction, said a Bharti spokesperson.

 A port is the interconnection point of the networks of two different operators. The operator who wants to interconnect pays the charges, which are then included in the cost of services. Since BSNL is the largest telecom operator in the country, most of the others have to pay port charges to BSNL for interconnection. 

 The Trai move, therefore, would have huge revenue implications for BSNL. We would lose around Rs 300-400 crore, said S.D. Saxena, director finance of the PSU.

 The reduction in existing charges is about 23 to 29 per cent for various slabs. The revised port charges, to be applicable from April 1, will be in the range of Rs 10,500 to Rs 39,000 instead of the current Rs 14,000 to Rs 55,000, Trai said.

 BA bottomline plunges 27%

London, Feb. 3 (Reuters): British Airways Plc (BA) has posted a 27 per cent fall in third quarter operating profit on Friday as fuel forced up costs and revenues grew slightly. 

 Tight security and labour disputes hit growth and prompted Europes third-largest airline to lower its full-year revenue outlook to a rise of 3.25 per cent to 3.75 per cent, from 4.5 per cent to 5.0 per cent announced three months ago. 

 Operating profit fell to 129 million ($254 million) on revenues of 2.07 billion, up 0.5 per cent from the October to December period a year earlier. 

 Operating profit for the year will now likely come in between 610 million to 660 million, analyst Gert Zonneveld at brokerage Panmure Gordon amp; Co wrote in a note after the results. 

 He noted that was lower than his forecast of 760 million but he maintained his 540 pence target price and Hold rating on BA. 

 The troubles that hurt BAs earnings have been well documented and so the results, the airlines weakest third quarter in four years, caused no panic. 

 Chief executive Willie Walsh recently quipped that BA, which for years used the slogan The worlds favourite airline had become The worlds favourite headline. 

 BA shares rose 1.6 per cent to 554-1/4 pence, outperforming Londons FTSE 100 index.

 These are mixed results with costs up 3 per cent, reflecting higher fuel costs and revenue up 0.5 per cent, Walsh said in a statement on Friday. 

 Fuel remains a significant burden with costs in the quarter up 11.2 per cent, he said. BA expects a fuel bill this year of 1.95 billion, up 350 million. 

 Chief financial officer Keith Williams told reporters on a conference call that the company expected fuel costs to rise between 5 per cent and 10 per cent in the quarter to the end of March, when it is 93 per cent hedged. Hedge cover for the remainder of calendar 2007 falls to 47 per cent, he said. 

 Chairman Martin Broughton said in a statement a recently averted strike would hit earnings for the current quarter. 

 The revenue outlook for the fourth quarter has been affected by the threat of industrial action. While the strike was averted, the estimated revenue loss is still some 80 million, Broughton said. Around one million passengers faced disruption until three strikes were called off on January 29. 

 External factors

 Bookings took a hit because of the uncertainty caused by the threatened strikes and Walsh said tight security measures continue to prompt some transfer passengers to avoid Londons busy Heathrow Airport. 

 Revenue has been hit by a raft of external factors. These include the continued impact of the August security measures. Common EU baggage standards on liquids were not agreed upon until mid-way through the quarter and more restrictive rules on hand baggage continue to apply in the UK, he said. 

 As a result, transfer volumes at Heathrow are still down, he added.

 Another problem was fog in Britain over a five-day period in December that prompted BA to cancel more than 800 flights. 

 Two breakdowns of luggage handling equipment at Heathrow added to complications, forcing BA to cover the cost of forwarding thousands of bags to passengers. 

 These two factors and the slower Heathrow transfer traffic amounted to 40 million in lost revenues and additional costs, BA said.

 New Delhi, July 16: The government today announced a rescue package of Rs 1,850 crore to help 29 ailing regional rural banks (RRBs) write off their losses by March 2010.

 We have taken a decision that all RRBs must have a positive net worth by March 31, 2010, finance minister P. Chidambaram said after his meeting with the chiefs of RRBs.

 Chidambaram said the Centre would provide 50 per cent of the funds needed to revive a bank, states would give 15 per cent and the remaining amount would come from promoter banks.

 The Centre has a 50 per cent stake in an RRB, the promoter public sector bank owns 35 per cent and the state government holds the remaining 15 per cent share.

 The Centre will contribute to the recapitalisation through bonds or cash of Rs 925 crore. The bonds are likely to get statutory liquidity ratio investment status to enable banks to subscribe to such papers.

 The commercial banks are likely to contribute their share in cash.

 The exercise will be undertaken immediately if state governments agree to put in their 15 per cent (Rs 277 crore) share to revive these banks, the minister added.

 If the states do not come forward with their contribution, recapitalisation of these RRBs will take some time, he said.

 The promise of fresh cash follows a pledge by the government to bail out loss-making co-operative banks and help them lend to poor farmers at cheaper rates. The World Bank is lending Rs 2,520 crore to the government for that programme.

 Chidambaram has also asked RRBs to reduce their net non-performing assets to an average of 1.3 per cent from 3.4 per cent. The 16 RRBs, which suffered losses in the last fiscal, have been asked to make profit and become viable by 2010.

 Vesuvius turns active: director duo send quit notice

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Aug. 19: Two independent directors are believed to have stepped down from the board of Vesuvius India.

 The Calcutta-based refractory maker, which is a subsidiary of the UKs Cookson Group Plc, has eight members on the board.

 It is learnt that Nitendra Mohan Ghosh and Shekhar Datta have resigned.Ghosh has acknowledged that he has put in his papers. 

 I have sent my resignation to chairman Saibal Kanti Gupta, Ghosh said.

 He cited differences of opinion with the board as the reason for severing ties of more that 20 years with the company but did not explain further.

 The Bombay Stock Exchange-listed company was one of the successful foreign direct investments in Bengal.

 Ghosh said he was instrumental in bringing Vesuvius to the city.

 Datta, however, declined to comment on whether he has tendered his resignation.

 However, Ghosh said, I understand that Datta has also resigned on the same grounds as mine.

 The company has denied that the directors have stepped down.

 There is no truth in this, Taposh Roy, company secretary of Vesuvius India, told The Telegraph.

 The eight-member board comprises two Cookson representatives Francois Wanecq and Luigi Gramizzi. S.K. Gupta is the chairman. 

 He is aided by managing director Tanmoy Ganguly and other board members Biswadip Gupta, Sudipto Sarkar, Ghosh and Datta.

 While no one was willing to comment officially on the real reasons, one of the directors said Ghosh and Datta might have exited since they were uneasy about the presence of three directors who are on the board of both Vesuvius and one of its largest customers, JSW Steel.

 Biswadip Gupta was the last to join Sajjan Jindal-run JSW Steel as an additional director on April 30, 2007 after stepping down from Vesuvius on April 17, where he was the managing director for the last 15 years.

 Sarkar and S.K. Gupta are also on the boards of JSW and Vesuvius for quite some time.

 Gupta is now a non-executive director in Vesuvius and also the chief executive officer of JSW Steels Bengal steel project.

 Gupta is credited with bringing in the biggest investment to the state in the history of Bengal. JSW Steel will put up a 10-million-tonne steel plant, power plant and additional infrastructure for Rs 35,000 crore.

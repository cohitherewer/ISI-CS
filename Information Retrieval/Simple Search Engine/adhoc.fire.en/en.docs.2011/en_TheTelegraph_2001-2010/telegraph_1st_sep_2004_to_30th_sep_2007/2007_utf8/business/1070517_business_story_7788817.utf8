 Energy awaits cash current

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, May 16: The energy sector needs between $120 billion and $150 billion (about Rs 6,50,000 crore) over the next five years to support a targeted 9-10 per cent growth in the economy.

 A KPMG report said such a huge sum can come from the private sector, and the government must adopt liberal policies to promote such investments. 

 Private investment in coal mining for captive use, oil and gas exploration and in the power sector is rising. Private participation in nuclear energy should also be allowed as and when the Indo-US nuclear deal goes through, the report said.

 In its approach paper for the Eleventh Plan (2007-12), the Planning Commission had said that a total investment of Rs 14,50,000 crore is necessary in infrastructure, including power and energy, to reach the annual growth of 9 to 10 per cent in the economy during the plan period.

 Compared with the advanced and other fast developing countries in the world, Indias current level of energy consumption is low. 

 Total annual energy consumption in 2004-05 was 572mt oil equivalent and per capita energy consumption was 531kg oil equivalent. 

 However, the requirement is expected to grow at 6.5 per cent per annum over the next five years, given the targeted GDP growth rate of 8 per cent and an estimated energy elasticity the proportionate increase in demand for energy following a percentage point rise in GDP of 0.80 per cent. 

 This means a four-fold increase in the countrys energy requirement over the next 25 years, which is a significant challenge for the country, the report said. 

 Private participation in the energy sector has increased in the last one year. The Atomic Energy Act is expected to be modified, allowing private investment in this segment, too. Many large domestic and international players have already started discussions for possible tie-ups, said Arvind Mahajan, KPMGs executive director (advisory), who also heads the energy and infrastructure sectors in KPMG.

 The government is also trying to bring in market mechanisms (where prices are determined by demand and supply in the market) in the energy sector under an independent regulator. 

 A gradual approach is important till the supply side position improves and more players enter the sector so that markets can work effectively, the report said. 

 The government plans to diversify the fuel basket by increasing shares of natural gas, hydro-electricity and even nuclear power in the overall energy basket. Both public and private sector companies are looking to acquire equity in energy assets such as oil and gas, and coal abroad, it added.

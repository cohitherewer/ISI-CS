 Calcutta, April 10: Standard Chartered Bank plans to pick up a 49 per cent stake in UTI Securities. The bank, which is keen to enter the domestic stock broking space, will look at other brokerage houses if it fails to buy into UTI Securities.

 Neeraj Swaroop, chief executive officer (India) of Standard Chartered Bank, said, We looked at several other brokerage houses before zeroing in on UTI Securities. However, if it does not come our way, we will go for some other brokerage. We want to offer our customers the entire gamut of financial services, including stock broking.

 The bank recently sold its mutual fund business to UBS Global Asset Management for $120 million. 

 The asset management company was a legacy of the Grindlays takeover. Globally, StanChart does not have any asset management company. Here, too, we sold the asset management arm only and not the mutual fund distribution business as the latter fetches more money, Swaroop said.

 StanChart also plans to offer private banking to high networth clients.

 The UK-based financial powerhouse is looking to acquire a domestic private sector bank. But current regulations dont allow us to hold more than 10 per cent stake in a domestic bank. We have made investments in a few, but those are below 5 per cent. However, after 2009, when foreign banks are likely to be allowed to pick up a higher stake, we will make a takeover move, Swaroop said.

 The bank is also considering increasing its 12.5 per cent benchmark prime lending rate soon.

 StanCharts proposed asset reconstruction company (ARC), planned a year ago, failed to take off as the bank could not rope in four domestic partners it had intended to. However, we are in talks with a few banks and the ARC is likely to come into being by the end of June this year, Swaroop said.

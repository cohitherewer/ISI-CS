 Equity dilution on the cards

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 2: The dust has settled on the battle for Corus but a niggling question remains: how will the Tatas fund the deal that puts the deal value at over $11 billion?

 The wisdom on the Street is that Tata Steel may have to decide on an equity dilution either locally or through a GDR issue to part fund the Corus buyout.

 Market mavens believe Tata Steel will have to examine the prospects of an equity dilution as taking recourse to additional debt on its books could send its equity-debt structure out of whack.

 Even as unconfirmed reports say the company could come out with a $500-million bond issue to part-finance the deal, the latest buzz is that Tata Steel is also considering raising funds through a global depository receipt (GDR) issue and a rights issue is also not ruled out.

 The Financial Times has reported that Tata Steel could raise up to $1.5 billion through a GDR flotation and that it is considering other options such as a domestic rights issue. 

 Market observers are not ruling out the possibility of Tata Sons selling a part of its stake in Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). It may be recalled that last November, Tata Sons sold 85 lakh shares of TCS. The holding company of the group raised over Rs 900 crore from the sale and it was felt that the money garnered would be used to fund the Corus buyout.

 However, officials from Tata Steel said the company has not yet taken a decision on the precise funding structure. Nothing has been finalised as yet, so we cannot say if the company is planning a GDR or a rights issue. By the end of this month, the financial arrangement should be clear, the official added.

 Available details suggest that both Tata Steel and Tata Sons would contribute $4.1 billion to Tata Steel UK, the main vehicle that will be used to acquire Corus. It is understood that Credit Suisse will fund 45 per cent of the debt component with the remaining coming from ABN Amro and Deutsche Bank. Standard Chartered Bank is also believed to be chipping in with subordinated debt funding that could run up to $1 billion.

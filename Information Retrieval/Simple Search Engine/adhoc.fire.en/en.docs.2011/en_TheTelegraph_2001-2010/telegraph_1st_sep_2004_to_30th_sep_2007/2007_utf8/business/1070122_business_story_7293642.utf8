 Paint MNCs keen on India as research hub

 VIVEK NAIR 

 Bright future

 Mumbai, Jan. 21: After pharma, it is the turn of paint multinationals to make a beeline for India to do research.

 According to industry circles, attracted by Indias vast talent pool, Akzo Nobel, Dupont, PPG Inc and Jotan are evaluating the possibility of setting up research and development centres in the country. The centres may not be as big as those for pharma, but the interest of the companies is a vote for the countrys research edge.

 Moreover, some of the companies may venture into manufacturing at a later stage. Analysts say there are many factors to encourage them in production as well. 

 The economy is growing at a robust pace and construction is witnessing hectic activity. Moreover, a host of global car manufacturers are either enhancing their capacities or setting up greenfield facilities. 

 National Paints, one of the largest paint manufacturers of West Asia, is toying with the idea of setting up a unit in the country. 

 Akzo Nobel is the worlds biggest paint company. It has diversified activities such as decorative coatings, industrial activities, car finishes, and marine and protective coatings. Dupont has a strong position in automotive finishes and industrial and powder coatings. 

 Over the next few months, you could see the worlds five leading paint companies setting up R amp;D centres in the country. India enjoys many advantages. Apart from a vast talent pool, English-speaking abilities also act as a major positive, an industry source said. 

 While the pharmaceutical industry has its own reasons for research, little is known about the initiatives of the paint multinationals in this field. 

 Just look at the industrys raw material costs. It constitutes close to 60 per cent of the total costs. If the industry is able to bring this down further, it could reap huge benefits. Moreover, research is also needed to improve product quality. Although the industry has been successful in drastically improving the product quality and durability, more can be done about it, said the source. 

 The leading paint manufacturers in India are Asian Paints, Kansai Nerolac Paints and ICI. Asian Paints is Indias largest company in the sector and the third-largest in Asia.

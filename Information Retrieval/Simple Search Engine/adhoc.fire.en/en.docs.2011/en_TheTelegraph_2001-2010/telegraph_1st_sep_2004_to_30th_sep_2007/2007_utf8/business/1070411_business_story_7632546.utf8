 Leyland weighs yet another new unit 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 10: Close on the heels of the Uttarakhand project, Ashok Leyland is planning another greenfield unit to meet the growing demand for its commercial vehicles.

 Though the location and the quantum of investment are yet to be decided, the capacity at the proposed new facility will be between 50,000 and 100,000 units.

 Now that the Uttarakhand commercial vehicle unit has taken off, we have another greenfield manufacturing facility in the pipeline. We will not rest happy with the 1-lakh-unit production mark. Our facilities are constrained to meet the high market demand and we have to think of ways to increase production, Ashok Leyland managing director and CII president R. Seshasayee said here today.

 Seshasayee was in the city to attend the annual general meeting of the CII (eastern region).

 To meet the growing market demand, the company plans to increase the number of working shifts at most of its facilities.

 On his plans for the east, Seshasayee said, We are evaluating options for the location of the new plant. The chances of Bengal as an investment destination is as good as any other state at this point in time. 

 The Uttarakhand project has been set up at an investment of Rs 1,000 crore. It will be operational by April 1, 2010.

 The company hopes to record sales of over 1 lakh units with a growth of 24 per cent this fiscal.

 However, the growth in the commercial vehicle segment may slow down to about 10-15 per cent from 30-35 per cent last fiscal because of higher interest rates. 

 Even the 10-15 per cent growth rate is good as the previous years growth was above normal, he said. 

 Concept vehicle

 Ashok Leyland is working on a concept global medium commercial vehicle.

 It would take another five to seven years for the vehicle to be rolled out. It is expected to contribute 15 per cent to the companys turnover.

 I would not term it as a global vehicle as I believe such a thing emerges according to prevalent local market conditions. But the one which is being conceptualised now will earn a bulk of the revenue from exports, Seshasayee said.

 On the possible manufacturing location of the concept vehicle, he said the companys facilities were flexible enough to churn out any kind of engine and chassis according to the needs of customers.

 Calcutta, June 13: Birla Sun Life Insurance Company has launched a unit-linked insurance policy Gold Plus Plan that would be sold to people as old as 70 years.

 It is an eight-year term policy and the premium will have to be paid for three years only, said S.K. Mitra, director of financial services, Aditya Birla Group. The minimum premium is Rs 10,000 and the minimum sum assured will be five times the premium of the first year. 

 However, you can also pay a higher premium in the first year and reduce it in the following years. The sum assured will not change, said Fabien Jeudy, chief actuary of Birla Sun Life Insurance Company. 

 For instance, on a premium of Rs 1 lakh paid in the first year, the sum assured will be Rs 5 lakh. However, in the second and third year, for an annual premium of Rs 10,000, the sum assured will still remain Rs 5 lakh. 

 Gold Plus also offers seven fund options, including a 100 per cent equity exposure. So, an individual can choose any one of the options depending on the risk appetite. One can even switch from one fund to another twice in a year without paying any additional charges. 

 Though the plan can be sold to people between 18 and 70 years, Gold Plus is particularly beneficial for seniors. They have to pay a premium for the first three years only and can wholly or partially withdraw the money anytime after three years. Between February and March, Birla Sun Life launched three unit-linked plans. This is part of the aggressive expansion plan chalked out by the company to regain its growth momentum. For the first three years since inception, our growth rate was in triple digits. But last year, we slowed down considerably. Our new business premium income was Rs 953 crore in 2006-07. In 2007-08, we are targeting a first-year premium income of Rs 2,000 crore through product launches, expansion of branches and an increase in our direct sales force, said Mitra. 

 The insurer is planning to open 202 branches during the first half of the current financial year and ramp up its agents to one lakh from 58,000. 

 To meet this target, we may need to infuse around Rs 700 crore this fiscal, Mitra said. As on March 31 this year, the company had a capital base of Rs 672 crore.

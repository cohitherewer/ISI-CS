 McLeod fancies a premium cuppa

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, April 29: McLeod Russel India Limited (MRIL) is taking steps to launch a premium tea brand.

 The company, which grows 75 million kg annually, is also keen to boost exports to Russia, Kazakhstan, Egypt and Pakistan.

 McLeod MD Aditya Khaitan said the company wanted to tap the growing premium market. Our products have to live up to the brand reputation and quality assurance which comes with the McLeod name, he said.

 Company officials are firming up investment plans and promotional strategies. They expect to launch the brand in the next six to eight months.

 The organised tea market in the country is around Rs 6,000 crore. In terms of volumes, it is 805 million kg, of which 36 per cent comprises packet tea. McLeod exports around 25 million kg in both blended and loose forms.

 Eveready Industries India Ltd, a McLeod group company, has a separate packet division. The company has brands such as Tez, Premium Gold, Jaago and Classic. Its plans include relaunch of the Greendale brand.

 In the domestic market, the race is between HLL and Tata Tea for the top spot in the branded segment. HLL has a 19 per cent market share and Tata Tea 18 per cent.

 Both the companies have recently launched products to become the market leader. Tata Tea is offering Tata Tea Life on the wellness platform. The company has put herbs and spices in the product. 

 HLL has created four sub brands under its Rs 1,000-crore Brooke Bond brand Red Label, Taj Mahal, Tazaa and 3 Roses. The company, like its rival, is also focusing on value-added varieties.

 Unlike McLeod, both the companies are reducing their presence in plantations to focus on brands.

 Latest statistics indicate that 2007-08 will be a good year for the tea industry as there is hardly any carry forward of tea stocks from last year. 

 McLeods chief financial officer Kamal Baheti earlier said he expected tea prices to increase by another Rs 5-7. We think prices will continue to firm up, as it did last year, and that will continue in the next year as well, he added.

 The company also plans to make further inroads into Egypt this year.

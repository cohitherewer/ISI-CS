 Chidambaram: Cash hope

 New Delhi, July 5: The cabinet committee of economic affairs today sanctioned Rs 77.25 crore towards the payment of arrears in 13 public sector undertakings under the department of heavy industries.

 It will mitigate the hardships of the employees, thereby motivating them for better output and preparing them to achieve the goal of revival for the companies, finance minister P. Chidambaram said after a meeting of the cabinet committee here.

 The sanctioned amount will take care of wages and other dues accumulated till March this year.

 These companies are unable to pay wages to their employees and the government is providing budgetary support for salary arrears.

 This is for the fourth time that the UPA government has provided grants to sick companies under the department of heavy industries to pay the dues of employees.

 The efforts of the government are paying off. The number of companies availing of these grants is coming down every year.

 The move will benefit the employees of Andrew Yule, Bharat Opthalmic, Bharat Wagon, Hindustan Cables, three subsidiaries of HMT, Hindustan Photo Films, National Instruments, NEPA, Instrumentation Limited, Triveni Structurals and Tungabhadra Steel Products.

 In September 2006, the government had approved a Rs 124.37-crore package to clear the arrears for the six months between January 1 and June 30, 2006.

 The ministry of heavy industries and public sector enterprises said the policy of providing support to troubled public sector enterprises would yield results as it had found that such cash support provided earlier had helped in turning around a few companies.

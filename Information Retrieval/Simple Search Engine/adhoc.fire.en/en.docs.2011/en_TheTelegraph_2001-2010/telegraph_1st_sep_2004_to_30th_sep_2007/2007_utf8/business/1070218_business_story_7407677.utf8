 GM plans to buy Chrysler

 New York/Detroit, Feb. 17 (Reuters): General Motors Corp (GM) is in preliminary talks to buy Chrysler, the struggling US arm of DaimlerChrysler AG, or strike a strategic alliance with the rival automaker, sources said on Friday. There was deep scepticism on Wall Street about whether such a merger made sense for GM and whether it could ever happen.

 An outright takeover of the Chrysler Group by GM would risk turnaround efforts of both the companies, analysts said, even as it created an industry giant with a nearly 40 per cent share of the US market.

 Talks to buy Chrysler, described by a source familiar with the situation as exploratory, were first reported on Friday by the trade journal Automotive News.

 The journal, citing unnamed sources in Germany and the United States, said the companies were engaged in high-level talks about the possible acquisition.

 One source said GM was in preliminary talks to buy Chrysler, but added it was questionable whether GM would want Chryslers finance business, having sold its own finance arm, GMAC, last year.

 A second source said talks were ongoing between the pair over a strategic car alliance but that source had no knowledge of any further talks.

 Bajaj Auto net skids 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 TIME TO SPEED UP

 Mumbai, July 12: Bajaj Auto has posted a 15 per cent drop in net profit at Rs 226.5 crore for the first quarter ended June 30 compared with Rs 266 crore in the year-ago period. The companys profit was hit by rising input costs and a lower demand for its products.

 The operating margin was squeezed to 13.2 per cent from 16.4 per cent. The turnover also dropped to Rs 2,211.8 crore from Rs 2,297.2 crore in the same period last year.

 Motorcycle sales plunged 11 per cent during the quarter because of rising interest rates and tighter financing by banks. The decline was sharper in the 100cc segment. The 125cc segment, however, recorded a growth of 16 per cent.

 The company had also initiated major structural changes in its distribution and logistics channel during the quarter. This led to a reduction of inventory at dealerships by around 45,000 motorcycles.

 The company is now gearing up for a strategic shift from the under-performing and over-priced 100cc segment to the 125cc motorcycles. 

 It has already launched three products this calendar year and has lined up a non-100cc four-stroke motorcycle in September. The pre-production work on the new bike was completed in June.

 Bajaj Auto is also planning to launch a cargo carrier which will take on the popular Ace of Tata Motors. This is expected to be launched by the end of the next fiscal. There are also reports of the company experimenting with the concept of a small car.

 Bajaj Autos three-wheeler sales increased 1 per cent to 71,336 units from 70,875 in the corresponding period a year ago. The companys total two and three-wheeler sales declined 12 per cent to 5,71,591 units from 6,47,094 in the year-ago period. Exports, however, increased 52 per cent to 1,49,804 units from 98,263 a year ago.

 Finance outlets

 Bajaj Auto Finance Ltd, a group company of Bajaj Auto , has added three more branches, expanding its network to 116 during the current quarter.

 It has also opened 11 more shops taking the total number of its finance outlets to 35, the company today said in a communique to the BSE.

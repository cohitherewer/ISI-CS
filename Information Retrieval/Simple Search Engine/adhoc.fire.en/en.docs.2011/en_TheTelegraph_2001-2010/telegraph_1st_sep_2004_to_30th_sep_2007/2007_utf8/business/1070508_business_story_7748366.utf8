 Union Bank cuts home loan rates

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Nair: Saving grace

 Mumbai, May 7: The Union Bank of India has cut interest rates on home loans up to Rs 20lakh by 50 basis points. 

 The downward revision is with immediate effect, chairman and managing director M.V. Nair told reporters here.

 The reduction will be applicable to fresh loans sanctioned on or after May 7. 

 The banks total exposure to the housing sector is Rs 4,465crore, of which 90 per cent comprises loans below Rs 20lakh.

 The bank is targeting a home loan growth of 25 per cent this fiscal, he said. 

 The Reserve Bank recently reduced the risk weightage on housing loans to 50 per cent. 

 The Union Bank is the first bank to bring down the interest rate on home loans following the change. Other nationalised banks are expected to follow suit soon. 

 Fixed-rate home loans up to five years will now come at 10.75 per cent, while the floating rate will be 3.25 per cent. 

 Interest rates on floating loans above 5 years and up to 10 years will now be reduced to 10.50 per cent. 

 Floating rate loans between 10 and 15 years and that over 15 years will now stand at 10.75 per cent. 

 The bank plans to raise Rs 1,500 crore in upper tier II and tier II structures at an appropriate time.

 We need to raise capital of around Rs 1,500 crore if we want to increase our loan book by 25 per cent while simultaneously meeting the Basel II requirements, Nair said.

 The amount would be raised through subordinated bonds and innovative instruments, he said. He declined to give a time frame for the exercise. 

 Nair said there would be no equity dilution while raising this amount.

 The bank has recorded a 57 per cent growth in net profit for the quarter ended March 31. Net profit grew to Rs 228 crore from Rs 145 crore in the year-ago period.

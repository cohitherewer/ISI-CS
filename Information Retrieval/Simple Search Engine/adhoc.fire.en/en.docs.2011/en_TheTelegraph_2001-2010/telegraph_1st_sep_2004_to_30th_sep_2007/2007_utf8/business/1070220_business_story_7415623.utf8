 JAYATI GHOSE

 Roy: Weaving success 

 New Delhi, Feb. 19: Calcutta-based Peerless General Finance and Investment Company is planning to triple its headcount to 15,000 in the next two years and mop up Rs 1,000 crore deposits by the end of the current financial year.

 To strengthen our position in the financial services market, we plan to hire more than 10,000 full-time employees in the next couple of years, managing director S. K. Roy told The Telegraph. The company has set a target of collecting Rs 1,000 crore deposits this fiscal, he added.

 The financial service provider has over 5,000 full-time employees and over one lakh agents. The company has a deposit base of more than Rs 5,000 crore and has already disbursed maturity payment of nearly Rs 14,000 crore.

 Peerless General Finance, which is celebrating its platinum jubilee year, is poised to enter mutual funds and micro-financing. 

 Mutual funds and life insurance offerings are dominating the market, along with innovative financial products like micro-credit. A shift in consumer preference for such products is clearly visible, said Roy. We are in the fact finding process for our foray into the micro-credit segment and would soon finalise a concrete way ahead, said Roy.

 Peerless General Finance, which received Sebis consent to start an asset management venture last month, proposes to set it up on its own. The asset management outfit, which will be headquartered in Calcutta, may position its fund management team in Mumbai. Mutual funds will clearly be a major business for us. We hope to tap existing customers. They will serve as a natural client base, said Roy.

 Peerless expects to initially roll out a few basic products, including a diversified equity fund. Retail investors will be provided the option of systematic investment plans.

 Pact with Iffco Tokio

 Peerless General Finance today signed a memorandum of association with Iffco Tokio General Insurance Company for the distribution of insurance products through its subsidiary, Peerless Developer.

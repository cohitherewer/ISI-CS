 New Delhi, Sept. 26: The World Bank has ranked India 120th among 178 nations in ease of doing business. 

 This is 12 ranks higher than last year and several notches below China which is ranked 83. The findings are in the Doing Businesss 2008 report prepared by the bank and its private sector lending arm, IFC. The report, released today, says Singapore is the best place to do business worldwide. 

 Rankings are based on time and costs involved in meeting government requirements vis--vis starting, operating and closing a business.

 India has been rated the best reformer in foreign trade by the report released today. 

 Egypt is the first among the list of reformers in ease of business within a country.

 On reasons for Indias top spot in foreign trade reforms, the report says traders now make customs declarations and pay fees online even before the cargo arrives in port. It said the time taken to meet administrative requirements had been cut to 18 from 27 a year ago. 

 Payment records of businesses and individuals are available. There is also an electronic collateral registry.

 Analysts said India had moved faster than China in the overall list. India moved up 12 places and China 9. 

 On the faster rise than China, Melissa Johns, member of the World Bank team that prepared the report, said, India did that by cutting time necessary to meet administrative requirements and in moving through customs. India also got right reforms to its credit regulations making it easier for entrepreneurs to get credit to grow their businesses.

 Several neighbouring countries such as Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka as well as less well-known places such as Tonga, Ethiopia, Mongolia, Ghana and Antigua rank higher than India in the overall list.

 According to the report, India lost out because of its complex taxation methods. Besides, it is the second worst country in the world in resolving a commercial dispute.

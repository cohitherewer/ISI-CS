 New Delhi, May 2: The SX4 sedan, the latest car from the Suzuki stable, will be launched first in India and then in Europe and Japan.

 Senior Suzuki officials said the car would be introduced this month.

 The car will carry a price tag in the range of Rs 6.5-7.5 lakh, and analysts said the company was aiming to sell about a lakh of SX4s.

 The car belongs to the upper A3 or the family sedan segment. It has an integrated music system, auto climate control, adjustable steering and a glass antenna. 

 The SX4 replaces the Baleno, which was phased out in December. Built on a new platform, the SX4 is fitted with the next generation M series engine of Suzuki. Sources said the European version would also have this engine.

 They said the 1.6-litre engine has four valves and has 102 bhp of power.

 Maruti posted a 17 per cent increase in domestic car sales in April. It sold 48,652 vehicles compared with 41,574 in the same period last year.

 Overall, the company sold 50,352 vehicles in domestic and international markets in April compared with 43,127 in the year-ago period, a company release said.

 Marutis sales in the domestic A2 segment, which includes the Zen, Swift and the Alto, grew 20.3 per cent and in the C segment, which houses the Omni and Versa, 21.1 per cent over the same period in 2006. The A1 segment recorded a 9.8 per cent dip in sales and the A3 segment saw a drop of 12.7 per cent.

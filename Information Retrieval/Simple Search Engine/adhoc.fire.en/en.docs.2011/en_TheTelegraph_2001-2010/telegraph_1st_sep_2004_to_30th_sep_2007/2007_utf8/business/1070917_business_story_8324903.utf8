 Tender boost to giant power projects

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Visakhapatnam, Sept. 16: Union energy minister Sushil Kumar Shinde today said tenders for mega power projects in the country would be cleared in 15 days. 

 We have appointed a group of ministers and will also consult international firms, if needed, to clear the process, Shinde said at the foundation stone laying ceremony of the second phase of the Simhadri thermal power project in Visakhapatnam today. 

 The power generation programme is on a sound footing and the country will achieve the target of a power surplus of five per cent by the end of 2011, he said. 

 In the second phase, the Simhadri unit will expand its capacity by 1,000MW with an investment of Rs 5,038 crore. 

 A mega power project is slated to come up at Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. 

 On the prospects of another such project in the state, the minister said, The state government should come forward with its needs for such projects. 

 Shinde rejected the state governments demand for higher allocation in the second phase of the Simhadri project. 

 Shinde urged the state to meet the demands of the agricultural sector from allocations made in the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana. 

 Around 25 lakh villages are to be connected under the rural electrification programme. However, only 40,000 villages have been covered so far, Shinde said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Factories star in growth show, farms disappoint

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, May 31: The economy recorded its highest growth rate in nearly two decades, though inflation was a major cause for concern.

 For 2006-07, the growth rate was 9.4 per cent, the highest since 1989 and more than the initial estimate of 9.2 per cent.

 The real per capita income measured in 1999-2000 prices went up to Rs 22,483, a growth of 8.4 per cent. Services and manufacturing are behind the high rates, according to the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) which released the new estimates today. The agriculture sector failed to deliver, reporting a growth rate of just 2.7 per cent.

 Inflation watch

 Analysts, however, cautioned against inflation. Prices have grown rapidly in recent months, with the inflation rate hovering above 6.5 per cent for several weeks.

 Key lending rates have been revised by the RBI several times to cool down prices. 

 To put a lid on inflation, the Centre has reduced import tariffs on both manufactured goods such as steel and cement and on farm products such as wheat and pulses.

 As a result, the government has put a leash on prices, and the inflation rate is now at a manageable level of 5 per cent. For the week ended May 19, the rate was 5.06 per cent.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the economy was likely to move on a high growth trajectory in this fiscal as well.

 However, high growth leads to high demand and high demand puts pressure on prices. Chidambaram said that unless supplies catch up with demand, there would be some pressure on prices. 

 The growth rate in the last quarter of the fiscal was lower at 9.1 per cent, a sign of a slowdown in the economy. There is a slowdown happening ... high prices are burning out demand somewhat and this in turn is moderating growth, S.P. Gupta, former member of the Planning Commission, said. 

 RBI forecast

 The RBI has forecast a GDP growth rate of 8.5 per cent for 2007-08. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has also forecast that the growth rate will slow down to 8.5 percent in 2007.

 According to the CSO, the high growth rate was powered by manufacturing and services while farming was a laggard.

 The manufacturing sector, which accounts for 15 per cent of the GDP, grew at 12.4 per cent. The service sector, which has a share of 60 per cent of the GDP, grew at 9.9 per cent.

 Farming, however, reported a growth rate of 2.7 per cent. The government is worried about the political fallout of low growth since the sector supports more than half of Indias population.

 Agriculture push

 In the last general elections, the Congress had highlighted rural distress to vote the BJP out of power. The BJPs message, India Shining, failed to win over voters.

 Gupta said that this distributive challenge remains for this government ... it has to make good its promise that it will push up farm growth and put more money in the pockets of farmers or less they may well face a political backlash. 

 The government had called a meeting of the National Development Council earlier this week where it chalked out a policy of taking the Green Revolution to the eastern states and raising production of foodgrain and other crops. At the NDC meeting, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said a vibrant farm sector was needed for a more inclusive growth.

 Reversing the prolonged slowdown in this sector is essential for inclusive growth, for ensuring that growth benefits all sections of society and all regions of the country, Singh said. The Prime Minister also pitched for direct fertiliser subsidies to farmers. 

 We must reflect whether subsidies, though necessary, are being delivered in the best possible manner, he said.

 The rates of growth of agriculture in the last decade have been poor and are a major cause of rural distress, he told the NDC.

 Reliance gas order to hurt urea units 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 22: Urea manufacturers could be affected by Bombay High Courts order restraining Reliance Industries from selling gas to third parties till 2016 from one of its major blocks in the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin. 

 Last January, the department of fertilisers had directed urea plants to start negotiating long-term gas supply contracts with GAIL or RIL. The department had expected the deals to be in place by the time commercial gas production started from RILs blocks in the KG basin. 

 Early last month, five fertiliser companies had submitted bids for gas from the KG basin. The deal would have helped them switch over to gas as a feedstock. 

 The government was keen on the switch to gas-based urea plants. At present, urea makers use six types of feedstock. 

 The Centre wants natural gas to be adopted as the preferred feedstock over other inputs, including naphtha or fuel oil. This is because gas is more efficient and a cleaner source of energy, apart from being cheaper and cost effective. 

 Over the past few years, the availability of natural gas even to gas-based plants has been coming under pressure because of the dwindling supplies. The feedstock was, however, allocated to other consumers at the cost of the fertiliser units. 

 The government data shows that against the total requirement of 33.01 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) of gas for gas-based units, the average supply during 2004-05 was 24mmscmd only. For 2005-06, while the total requirement was a little over 35mmscmd, the actual supply was only 28.09mmscmd. 

 Most of the gas in India is produced from the western offshore fields and is fed to the Hazira-Bijapur-Jagdishpur pipeline for distribution. Though units located along the HBJ pipeline have entered into contracts for procurement of regasified liquefied natural gas, there are many units which are not connected to the HBJ pipeline. 

 In the interim order, Bombay High Court on Thursday said that 81.6mmscmd from the KG block can be sold only to RNRL, NTPC or for RILs own captive use for the next eight years.

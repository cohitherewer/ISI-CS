 Corus boosts Tata Steel numbers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 28: Tata Steel went a step closer towards integration with Corus Group Ltd when it published consolidated results for the first time today.

 During the first quarter of this fiscal, the consolidated net turnover of the company vaulted to Rs 31,155 crore compared with Rs 5,748 crore during the corresponding period of the previous year. 

 The consolidated operating profit shot up to Rs 4,904 crore compared with Rs 1,712 crore in the same period last year, while the profit before tax and exceptional items increased to Rs 3,157 crore compared with Rs 1,498 crore during the first quarter of 2006-07.

 Net profit went up from Rs 1,013.94 crore to Rs 6,337.99 crore on a like-to-like basis.

 The financial results also include extraordinary items of Rs 4,121 crore, primarily representing actuarial gains because of an increase in yield rates on bonds held by the pension funds of Corus which Tata Steel acquired earlier this year.

 The consolidated interest expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 was Rs 892 crore, which included interest charge of Rs 725 crore on loans taken for financing the acquisition of Corus.

 Tata Steel, which turned 100 on Sunday, had last week created the post of chief operating officer.

 H.M. Nerurkar, currently vice-president of the Kalinganagar steel project, has been chosen for the job.

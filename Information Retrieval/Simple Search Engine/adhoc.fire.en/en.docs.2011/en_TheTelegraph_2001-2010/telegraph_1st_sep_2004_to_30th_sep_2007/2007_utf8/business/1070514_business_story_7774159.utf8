 Mylan bags Merck arm for $6.6bn

 BOOSTER DOSE

 Frankfurt, May 13 (Agencies): German drugs and chemicals group Merck KGaA has agreed to sell its generics business to US-based Mylan Laboratories Inc for 4.9 billion euros ($6.6 billion) in cash.

 The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second half of this year, Merck said in a statement on Sunday.

 The generics business had sales of 1.8 billion euros in 2006, making it the fourth in the world behind Israel-based Teva, Novartis of Switzerland and Americas Barr Pharmaceuticals.

 Analysts had expected the unit to be sold for up to 4.8 billion euros and have said Merck may use part of the proceeds to reduce debt taken on to finance the acquisition of Switzerlands Serono, Europes biggest biotech company.

 This transaction will allow Merck to focus its resources on further growth within its pharmaceuticals and chemicals business sectors, Merck chief executive Karl-Ludwig Kley said in the statement.

 A combination with Mylan represented the most convincing strategy for our generics business, he added.

 Mylan said in a separate statement that the merger would create a vertically and horizontally integrated generics and specialty pharmaceuticals leader with a diversified revenue base and a global footprint.

 On a pro-form a basis, the combined company would have had revenues of about $4.2 billion and a gross profit, or EBITDA, of about $1.0 billion in 2006, Mylan said.

 Mylans acquisition of Merck Generics will substantially complete the execution on one of its long-term visions: to create a world class global quality generics leader, Mylans vice-chairman and chief executive officer Robert J. Coury said.

 The us firm, which had acquired 51.5 per cent in Indias Matrix Laboratories for $736 million in cash last year, said the latest acquisition would strengthen the companys hold in the global genercis market.

 Ranbaxy and Cipla were among the other firms which had shown interest in Mercks global generics business but later dropped out citing overvaluation.

 Mylan said it expects to achieve synergies of approximately $250 million by the end of year three and does not anticipate significant reductions in headcount at Mylan, Matrix or Merck Generics to achieve these synergies.

 Ranbaxy Laboratories had pulled out of the race to acquire the generic drug business of Merck on concerns of over-valuation. Ranbaxy was the only Indian company to have cleared the first round of bidding and it is believed to have withdrawn from the race after indications that an auction could take the valuations to over $6.5 billion.

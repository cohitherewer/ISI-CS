 Diageo in high spirits

 More the merrier

 Calcutta, April 18: Diageo Radico Distilleries plans to launch two whisky brands in the deluxe or prestige segment in the next 18 months.

 This 50:50 joint venture company of Diageo and Radico Khaitan has launched its first brand in the deluxe segment Masterstroke in the city.

 The joint venture will look at developing brands. We will focus on brown spirits, especially whisky. We will closely monitor the response to our product. We will consider launching one to two more brands in the same segment in the next 18 months, said Raju Vaziraney, chief executive officer of Diageo Radico Distilleries.

 The deluxe segment falls between the regular and the premium and enjoys the fastest growth rate of 30 per cent among whiskies.

 Diageos experience in the premium segment, coupled with Radicos knowledge in the regular, will help us combine our expertise, Vaziraney added.

 The growth rate for whisky, which comprises around 60 per cent of the domestic spirits market, is 10 per cent.

 After about 12 to 18 months, Diageo London will conduct a market survey in the country with Radico.

 In certain alcohol categories, consumers, especially beginners, have jumped to the deluxe segment instead of starting with the regular. So the price point has been raised. We plan to study such trends and then decide on the future course of action, Vaziraney said.

 Diageo plans to offer strategic marketing advice to the joint venture. Peter J. Warren, the noted distiller and whisky consultant for Diageo, will offer marketing solutions. Warren created the spirit which goes into Johnnie Walker.

 Diageo Radico Distilleries aims at capturing a 20 per cent market share of the premium segment in Bengal by the end of one year. In this period, the target for India is between 15 and 20 per cent.

 The size of the alcohol market in eastern India is 10 million cases per annum. The sale of whiskies is seven million cases, with deluxe whisky comprising 0.62 million cases.

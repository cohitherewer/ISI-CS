 Lenovo earnings set to take a giant leap

 Profit booking

 Hong Kong, Jan. 29 (Reuters): Lenovo Group Ltd may post its best quarterly earnings since buying IBMs loss-making PC arm in 2005. The company booked cost savings from restructuring and cemented market share in Asia. 

 But investors will look at how the PC giant further overhauls itself in 2007 to regain the ground lost globally, especially with Microsofts Vista operating system on the way. 

 Lenovo one of a handful of Chinese firms trying to forge a global brand by investing abroad has been grappling with expenses arising from its $1.25-billion purchase of IBMs PC arm. It also faces stiff competition from bigger rivals, Dell and Hewlett-Packard.

 Chinas largest maker of PCs is expected to post a profit of HK$451.5 million ($57.9 million) for the October-December period, according to four analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates. That represents a 24 per cent rise from a HK$365-million profit a year ago. 

 Since corporates will wait for three to four quarters before adopting a new major operating system, the Vista launch has no immediate impact on corporate demand over the next two to three quarters, said JP Morgan analyst Charles Guo. 

 We expect Lenovo International to grow slower than the industry average and thus continue to lose market share, because the Chinese firm was more dependent on corporate sales than consumer-oriented rivals such as Acer, he said. 

 Lenovo executives have said the firm would book roughly half of some $100 million in anticipated cost savings which involved cutting staff and combining sales teams in the end-December and end-March quarters. They did not specify how much would be booked each quarter. 

 Analysts say the results may include a partly IBM-related restructuring charge of up to $9 million. Lenovo is expected to post a full-year net profit of HK$986.12 million, more than five times last years HK$173.24 million, according to Reuters Estimates. 

 Lenovo shares rose 3.3 per cent in October-December, lagging a 13.8 per cent gain on the main index. Yet it trades at a lofty 29 times prospective earnings pricier than Dells 20.3 and HPs 16.4.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 The party is over

 Deposit rates have started falling; loan rates will dip in September. Run to the bank now if you want to lock into a 9% deposit, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 Thirty five-year-old Kalyani Ghosh, a housewife, has an interesting story to tell.

 After her father died in April, she got Rs 1 lakh as the maturity value of a couple of fixed deposits that her father had parked with Uco Bank during his lifetime. It was the second week of June and I decided to reinvest the sum in a fresh bank deposit. I did it for a five-year term with Uco Bank as it was offering an interest rate of 9.75 per cent per annum, Kalyani said. 

 A couple of weeks later, she went to the bank with Rs 50,000 more (which she got when another term deposit made by her father matured) to open another fixed deposit. 

 But this time, the bank told me I would not get a 9.75 per cent interest for five years. The bank is now offering just 9.6 per cent interest on fixed deposits between one year and 33 months. It was July 10. I got a call from the bank in the evening. They said I would not get even 9.6 per cent on my second deposit. From that very day, the bank had reduced its maximum interest rate (on deposits) to 9.25 per cent, she added.

 Rates drop

 Starting this month, several banks have started revising their deposit rates downwards; others plan to do this soon. So, hurry up if you want to lock some of your funds in fixed deposits guaranteeing more than 9 per cent interest a year. Or else, you may not get these rates after a month. 

 Interest rates have started falling. But for now, its just deposit rates that have started to dip. Come September, borrowers will be able to breathe easy. Banks are likely to start reducing their lending rates as they head into the third quarter of the current financial year. 

 There is enough liquidity in the market. The inflation rate has moderated. Even the yield on long-term government securities has come down over the past month. In short, the triggers for higher interest rates have abated to a large extent, said A.C. Mahajan, chairman and managing director of Allahabad Bank. 

 No one is now willing to take a loan at 9.75 per cent or more. So, the urgency for banks to raise resources through deposits has waned to such an extent that we are no longer mobilising bulk deposits at higher rates. We are giving a 9 per cent plus interest rate only to retail depositors, Mahajan said, adding that the bank was thinking of pruning this rate shortly. 

 You can expect the deposit rate to come down to 9 per cent across banks in the short term, he said. 

 Dena Bank chaairman P. L. Gairola said, Deposit rates are likely to decline by 50 to 100 basis points (one basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point) by the end of the second quarter.

 Game plan

 Given the interest rate scenario, you can immediately park half of your investible surplus in the longest term bank fixed deposits that offer more than 9 per cent interest. The rest you can invest in equity assets that are expected to yield an annual return of 18 to 20 per cent over the next three to five years. The return on your overall portfolio will, thus, work out to 15 per cent. This may seem a piffle, but its largely risk-free because half of your investment is in a guaranteed return scheme.

 Fixed maturity plans

 Along with the decline in interest rates, the returns on fixed maturity plans of mutual funds have also started coming down. FMPs that caught investors fancy a month ago by giving an indicative return of 11 per cent annually are now yielding 8.5 per cent for a two-year term. 

 When there is a downtrend in interest rates, banks first reduce their rates on liabilities (read, deposits). The rate reduction on assets (read, loans) follows after a lag, said Mahajan. 

 The two CMDs, however, agree that banks are likely to reduce their lending rates from September onwards. So, existing borrowers who have taken a loan on a floating rate basis and have seen their loan tenures increased till their retirement age or the EMIs hiked by banks because the repayment terms could not be extended, will be able to breathe a little easy. 

 New loan seekers

 Prospective borrowers would do well to wait till October before signing a loan agreement. Even the manufacturers are seeing a silver-lining in their business beyond September. 

 They, too, are expecting a decline in lending rates and a resultant spurt in credit-backed demand. Bajaj Auto has decided to unveil a new two-wheeler model in September. 

 Bankers say the interest rates for retail loans such as home loans, car loans, personal loans will first come down followed by corporate and other lending rates.

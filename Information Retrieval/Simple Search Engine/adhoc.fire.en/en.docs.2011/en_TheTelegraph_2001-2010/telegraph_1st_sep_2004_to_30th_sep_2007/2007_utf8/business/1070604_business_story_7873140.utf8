 Beat banking blues

 Aggrieved customers can turn to a banking ombudsman for redressal, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 Sandip Banerjee has a salary account with HDFC Bank. His bank is supposed to send him account statements every quarter free of cost by post. Banerjee has received only two such statements in the last two years. 

 Last week, Banerjee needed a bank statement for a visa application. He approached his bank and got it. Later, he discovered that the bank had deducted Rs 245 from his account for issuing the statement. 

 Banerjee had earlier requested for a passbook, but was refused despite an RBI directive to all commercial banks to issue passbooks. He approached the bank for redressal but realised it would do little to help him. Thats when his friend told him he could approach the RBIs banking ombudsman. 

 Banerjee soon realised that the banking ombudsman offices across the country handle cases involving both small sums like his and those involving even a few crores. 

 TCS employee Sudha Sharma was compensated for Rs 977,000 that was withdrawn from her salary savings account with forged cheques. 

 In another case, a state-run enterprise recovered an interest income of Rs 795,129,25 on a fixed deposit that its bank declined to pay citing unauthenticated alterations on the certificate of deposit. The entity had asked the bank in writing to extend the maturity of the fixed deposit. 

 Redressal scheme 

 The Banking Ombudsman Scheme was first introduced in June 2002 by the Reserve Bank of India. The scheme was last modified on May 24 this year.

 Bank customers can now even appeal against the decision of the banking ombudsman if he/she rejects a complaint. The appellate authority for the scheme is the deputy governor of the RBI.

 Before this amendment, customers could appeal only against the awards given by the ombudsman.

 Write to your bank 

 However, before filing a complaint with the ombudsman, a customer has to first try to find a solution directly with the bank. The complainant should write to the bank about his/her problem and wait for a month for a reply.

 Stay within time limit

 If the reply does not arrive within a month or if the bank rejects the complaint, the customer can file his/her complaint with the ombudsman. 

 The complaint should be made within a year from the date the event took place. 

 Quick judgment 

 There is a time limit of six months from the first hearing within which the ombudsman has to pass a judgment. 

 Easy implementation 

 If the customer is happy with the order, he/she will write an acceptance letter to the bank. The bank has to comply with the order within a month of receiving the customers letter if it agrees with the decision and also inform the ombudsman after following its order. 

 If the bank does not agree with the order, it can apply for a review with the authority concerned under the scheme. 

 No costs involved 

 The complainant does not have to pay anything during this whole process. Costs are shared by banks. 

 How to apply 

 There is a prescribed format available with all banks. However, a customer can also write to the ombudsman on paper, file a complaint online at www.bankingombudsman.rbi.org.in or send an email to the ombudsman. 

 A complainant can also authorise a person, other than an advocate, to appear before the ombudsman during a hearing. 

 Is it popular?

 The number of complaints filed in 2001-02 was 5,907. The figure jumped to 31,782 in 2005-06. The scheme became more popular since January 2006 with the inclusion of services such as credit cards within its ambit.

 Banking ombudsman offices received 9,723 complaints between April and December in 2005. The number was doubled (22,009 to be precise) between January and June last year.

 However, the ombudsman offices did not consider all complaints. Nearly 50 per cent of the complaints lodged were rejected as these were outside the purview of the scheme or were brought to the ombudsman a bit too early. 

 Out of the 31,782 complaints received in 2005-06 and another 1,631 brought forward from the previous year, only 21,059 qualified for the scheme and the ombudsman offices disposed of 14,889 of them during the same year. In other words, 6,170 complaints were carried forward to 2006-07 from 2005-06.

 The banking ombudsman scheme doesnt deal with the credit decision of a bank or its employees behaviour towards customers.

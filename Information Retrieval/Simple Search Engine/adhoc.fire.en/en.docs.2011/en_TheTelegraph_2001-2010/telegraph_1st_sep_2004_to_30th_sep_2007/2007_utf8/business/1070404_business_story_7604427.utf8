 Indian Hotels buys Campton Place

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 3: The Indian Hotels Company (IHC) is buying out Campton Place for $60 million through its 100 per cent US subsidiary. Campton Place is a 110-room luxury boutique hotel in Union Square, San Francisco. 

 IHC today informed bourses that the acquisition would include estimated transaction costs. 

 The hotel will be acquired in partnership with financial investors. The sale-purchase agreement was signed yesterday and the transaction would be completed by the end of this month, the company added. 

 IHC has been looking at overseas acquisitions over the past few years. Ratan Tata had indicated to IHC shareholders in the companys annual general meeting last year that it may increase its presence in countries like Thailand and South Africa. 

 In December 2005, IHC acquired the W Hotel in Australia for Australian $36 million. IHC, which had earlier taken over the Pierre Hotel in New York, had then indicated it is targeting other nations, including China, Bhutan and Dubai, to enhance its presence. 

 The Australian acquisition was a 100-room five-year-old hotel, located close to the central business district of Woolloomooloo Bay, Sydney. The hotel used to be run by the Starwood Group and it figured amongst the top five hotels in Sydney. 

 IHC has also secured management contracts at Palm Island, Jumeirah in Dubai, Langkawi in Malaysia and Thimpu in Bhutan. 

 Last year, Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces also entered into a definitive agreement to purchase The Ritz-Carlton, Boston from owners Millennium Partners. The $170-million transaction closed in January 11 this year. The hotel, which has 273 rooms, is located next to the Boston Public Garden and the citys premiere retail district.

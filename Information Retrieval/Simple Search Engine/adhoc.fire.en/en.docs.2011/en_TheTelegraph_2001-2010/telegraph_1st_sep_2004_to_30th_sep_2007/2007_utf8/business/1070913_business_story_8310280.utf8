 Rao tipped to head WBIDC

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 12: M.V. Rao, state director of industries, is likely to become the next managing director of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC).

 Rao will succeed Debasis Som who resigned in July as WBIDC managing director to take up a private sector job.

 The first sign of Rao succeeding Som became evident today when he joined the board of Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL). 

 Rao and Som were both in Delhi today for the board meeting. 

 The state government holds a stake in HPL through the WBIDC, whose managing director is always on the companys board.

 HPL also inducted Atul K. Rai as the nominee of the Industrial Finance Corporation of India. Rai replaced R.M. Malla.

 The Chatterjee Group (TCG), the other major shareholder in HPL, besides the state government, had moved court to stall the board meet and prevent it from appointing a financial institution director. 

 The TCG counsel told the court that the meeting should not be allowed to go ahead with the appointment of a director from the Industrial Finance Corporation of India.

 The court refused to entertain the plea and asked tcg to file an application if they wanted to pursue the matter.

 Before his assignment to the industries department, Rao had served as the district magistrate of West Midnapore.

 During his tenure, political clashes broke out at Keshpur and Garbeta in the region.

 Rao played a key role in the peace process, providing assistance to political party workers by enrolling them into self help groups. 

 The 1988 batch IAS officer also had a stint in the Unicef, overseeing child health programmes in the city.

 Rao was also at the forefront of the land acquisition in Singur. He canvassed door to door in the villages to explain the benefits of the project to landowners.

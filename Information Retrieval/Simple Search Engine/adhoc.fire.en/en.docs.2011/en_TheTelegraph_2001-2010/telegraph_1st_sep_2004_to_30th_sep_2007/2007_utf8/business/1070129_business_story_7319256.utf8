 Q amp;A

 Wait lengthens

 I will attain 65 years of age in August this year. Can I get the senior citizen benefit for income tax purposes for the assessment year 2007-08? 

 M.N. Haque, Birbhum

 No, you are not eligible for senior citizen benefits for financial year 2006-07, or assessment year 2007-08. However, from the next financial year, you will attain the senior citizen status under the income tax laws. 

 Share transfer

 My wife wants to transfer some company shares in my name as she doesnt have a PAN. She is a housewife and doesnt have any income. Do we have to record these transfers as a gift deed? If so, what will be the value of the stamp paper? The purchase value of these shares is below Rs 2 lakh.

 D.K. Mukherjee, Calcutta

 If the shares are held in paper/certificate form, there is a better way to transfer. Get valid transfer deeds, one for each share certificate. Your wife will fill up the form as seller and you as a buyer. The consideration of the sale should correspond to the market value of those shares. Then affix share transfer stamps equivalent to 0.5 per cent of the sale consideration this is the stamp duty in the space provided in the transfer deed and send it to the registrar of the company for registering those shares in your name. The name transfer may take two to three months.

 Capital concern

 I am a central government employee. I sold some shares in 2005 after holding the same for two years. But I didnt mention the capital gains in my income tax return. Is it mandatory to mention the transaction in my income tax statement? 

 Anup Lal, Guwahati

 der the existing income tax law, long-term capital gains on equity investment do not attract any tax. Shares held for more than a year are considered long-term asset. This means that you need not show your capital gains from selling those shares in your income tax statement.

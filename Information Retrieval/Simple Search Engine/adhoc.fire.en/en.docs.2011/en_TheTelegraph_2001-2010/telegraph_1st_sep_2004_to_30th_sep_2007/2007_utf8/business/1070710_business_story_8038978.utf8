 Priority to consensus on spectrum

 Trying to connect

 New Delhi, July 9: The department of telecommunications (DoT) is trying to arrive at a consensus with the defence ministry on the release of additional spectrum to telecom companies.

 An understanding on spectrum is essential before a crucial meeting of the group of ministers (GoM) in early August.

 The GoM was set up to oversee the vacation of spectrum by the defence ministry for the benefit of telecom companies. However, the GoM has never met since its formation 18 months ago.

 The defence ministry is reluctant to release 45 megahertz (Mhz) of spectrum, as demanded by the DoT, without being given an alternative medium of communication.

 The DoT feels if a consensus is reached with the ministry on the alternative, it should be able to get more than 45Mhz. 

 A senior DoT official said an option was BSNLs optical fibre cable project which would cover 400 points across the country and cost over Rs 1,000 crore. This can be the alternative the defence ministry is seeking. If they agree it can enable the defence forces to release spectrum even over and above the 45Mhz we have been seeking.

 However, the delay in laying the cable coupled with the ministrys security concerns mean there is still no solution to the problem of spectrum crunch. 

 The armed forces have already expressed their reservations on a move to the optic fibre-based system because they fear an attack on the communication network. For the DoT, the problem is not just restricted to getting the defence ministry to agree to an alternative. It also must make spectrum available in sufficiently large amounts to fulfil the ever-growing demand for the scarce resource from telecom companies.

 GSM players such as Bharti Airtel and Hutch have demanded an additional 13.2MHz of spectrum in the 2.5Ghz band. CDMA operators say they need an additional 5Mhz in the 800Mhz band and 20Mhz in the 1900Mhz band.

 We have put forth our requirement to the DoT, said S.C. Khanna, secretary general of the Association of Unified Service Providers of India, which represents the interests of CDMA operators.

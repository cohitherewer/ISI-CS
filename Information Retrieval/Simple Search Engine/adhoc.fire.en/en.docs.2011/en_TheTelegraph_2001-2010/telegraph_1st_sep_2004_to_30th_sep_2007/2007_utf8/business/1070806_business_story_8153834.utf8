 Graphite unit in China

 RANJAN DASGUPTA 

 Ranchi, Aug. 5: Chotanagpur Graphite Industries, the oldest graphite SME unit in Jharkhand, will spread its wings abroad.

 The companys management has approved an investment of over Rs 10 crore to set up two manufacturing units. 

 One will come up in China and the other at Palamau district of the state. 

 The units will boost graphite production to over 12,000 tonnes from 4,000 tonnes per annum, said Shishir Poddar, director of Chotanagpur Graphite.

 The company will cash in on the boom in the steel sector, both in India and China. Chotanagpur Graphites natural graphite flakes and powder are used in the steel and refractory industry. 

 The state has only five operational units to produce graphite. 

 Chotanagpur Graphites plant is in Garwah district.

 Poddar said the Chinese unit would be set up as a joint venture. 

 We are in the final stage of negotiations with a leading manufacturer of graphite products in China. The agreement will be signed in a few months, he added. 

 The company will be able to access better technology if it sets up a unit in China.

 Moreover, China has more graphite deposits than in India and the cost of mining is also less. 

 Chotanagpur Graphites domestic venture at Palamau will cater to its planned steel plants in Jharkhand, Orissa and Chhattisgarh. 

 According to industry sources, there are good graphite deposits in Palamau and many zones remain unexplored.

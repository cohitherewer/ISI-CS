 Realty levy caught in a legal logjam

 Rent woes

 New Delhi, March 11: The Congress-led government may have bitten off more than it can chew with its levy in the budget of 12.36 per cent service tax on firms renting out immovable property.

 Lawyers feel courts can strike down the provision as it violates the states exclusive right to tax land and buildings.

 The levy is over renting, letting out and leasing out of any immovable property, including factories, office buildings, warehouses, theatres, exhibition halls and multiple-use buildings, for commercial use. However, renting out to a religious or educational body is outside the purview of tax.

 Even rented property partly used for commercial and partly for residential purposes will be taxed. According to lawyers, the problem is two-fold. First, they feel rent cannot be defined as a service. Second, the exclusive right to tax land and buildings vests with state governments as the subject is in the state list. 

 It (the service tax on renting property) is really a piece of bad legal drafting someone, somewhere should have realised that there is hardly any service in renting out property there is no value addition which can be taxed here, said Bishwajit Bhattacharyya, a senior Supreme Court counsel. Moreover, it impinges on the power of the state legislature to tax land and buildings, Bhattacharyya added. 

 Senior income tax officials, however, said the levy is part of a strategy to identify and tax those services which are untaxed.

 We are just plugging those loopholes which exist this is certainly not an attempt to tax a state subject, officials said. Lawyers said if a ready-to-use office space with furniture and ancilliary services was rented out or if shopfloors with machinery and personnel were rented out, it could have been a service sector business. But pure property rentals cannot be defined as a service industry.

 Experts feel much will depend on how the courts view renting. If they agree that it is a service, the Centre might get away with this. If they do not, it will be seen as a violation of state rights on taxation, said Sudatto Sen, a senior income tax practitioner who is advising corporate clients on similar issues.

 Companies and chambers are gearing up to take up this issue as they feel the new tax will simply be passed on by property owners to end-users.

 Idea Cellular set to merge siblings

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Feb. 6: Idea Cellular will merge all its subsidiaries with itself except real estate outfit Swinder Singh Satara amp; Co. 

 The telecom service provider has eight subsidiaries, four of which are special purpose vehicles (SPVs) floated to acquire existing licence holders in different telecom circles, three are GSM service providers in 11 circles in which Idea operates and one is a real estate company.

 The boards of these subsidiaries have given their in-principle approval to the merger proposal. We will soon apply to the respective high courts for permission to the scheme of amalgamation, said Bharat Banka, president and head group finance, Aditya Birla Group.

 Idea Cellulars four SPVs have an accumulated loss of Rs 96.03 crore. Each of these four SPVs own 25 per cent of equity capital of BTA Cellcom, the groups only profit-making subsidiary providing GSM services.

 BTA Cellcom provides GSM services in the Madhya Pradesh circle. For the nine months ended December 31, 2006, it made an after-tax profit of Rs 80.60 crore, wiping out an accumulated loss of Rs 51.86 crore. 

 The other two subsidiaries Idea Mobile Communications Ltd and Idea Telecommunications Ltd provide GSM services in Kerala, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh (west) circles and in Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh (east) circles, respectively. The two together had an accumulated loss of Rs 1,035.52 crore on December 31, 2006.

 If these subsidiaries and SPVs are merged with Idea Cellular, the amalgamation will result in Rs 1,131.55 crore loss transferred to the parents books. 

 On December 31, 2006, Idea Cellular had Rs 1,731.40 crore accumulated loss (including losses of the subsidiaries and SPVs) on its balance sheet.

 The company, however, reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 301.57 crore for the nine months ended December 31, 2006. This means that the company still suffers a net loss of Rs 1,429.84 crore.

 Though we have provided for the losses suffered by the subsidiaries and SPVs in our consolidated financial statement, the main purpose of the merger is that it would help the parent company claim tax relief and higher depreciation benefits, said Banka. As of now, Idea Cellular cannot claim tax relief on the losses suffered by its subsidiaries and SPVs, he added.

 The amalgamation will also help the company rationalise and efficiently use its human resources, particularly at the managerial levels.

 Calcutta, Aug. 20: The Bengal government is setting up a company to generate power from renewable energy.

 The Green Energy Development Corporation, the name of the new entity, will be the second outfit in this sector in the state.

 The other is the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency (WBREDA), a not-for-profit organisation promoting non-conventional power sources. 

 The (state) cabinet has already approved the proposal for the formation of Green Energy Development Corporation with an initial equity capital of Rs 5 crore. The company will be incorporated in two months, state power minister Mrinal Banerjee said here today on the sidelines of the seminar, Emerging Power Policy vis--vis Global Warming, organised by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 

 The minister said the organisation structure and business plan of Green Energy would be finalised after discussions with promoters. 

 The promoters are West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd, which will take a 30 per cent stake; the WBREDA, which will take a 25 per cent; and West Bengal Power Development Corporation Ltd, which will take a 45 per cent stake.

 The WBREDA works as a nodal government agency to promote renewable energy sources on a non-profit basis. But its now time that we should think about the generation of renewable power in hundreds of mega watts. For this, we need another organisation that will take up the development and generation of green energy on a commercial basis. Which is why Green Energy Development Corporation is being formed, WBREDA director S.P. Gon Chaudhuri said. 

 He said Green Energy would not only operate renewable power projects but also pick up equity stakes in other projects. Green Energy will also facilitate single-window clearances for non-conventional power projects. 

 The company will be involved in solar energy, wind energy and the generation of power from biomass. It will also participate in small hydel projects.

 At present, about 56 mw of power in the state comes from non-conventional sources. 

 This is expected to go up to 100 mw in 2009 and to 250 mw by the end of the Eleventh Five Year Plan, Gon Chaudhuri said. 

 A bulk of the power will be generated by the private sector. The state government has already approved private sector projects of 150mw capacity at an investment of Rs 700 crore. Besides, there are projects worth Rs 11,000 crore under various stages of negotiation and implementation, Banerjee said.

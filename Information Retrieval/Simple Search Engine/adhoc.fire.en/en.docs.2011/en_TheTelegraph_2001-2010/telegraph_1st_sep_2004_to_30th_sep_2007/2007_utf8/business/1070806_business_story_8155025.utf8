 Call quality fears rise in state

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA 

Calcutta, Aug. 5: Mobile phone users in the state are bracing for a severe drop in the quality of service because of the shortage in the availability of spectrum, which carts call signals through the atmosphere.

 A UBS Securities study says the allocation of spectrum is the lowest for the city compared with the other three metros Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai while the shortage for the city circle and the Bengal circle is as high as 32.6mhz.

 A study by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) even says that the quality of service is the worst in the state. The situation could deteriorate if the defence department does not vacate its quota by September.

 All mobile phone operators are grappling with the shortage, and the UBS study says the situation is grave in the top 25-30 cities of the country.

 A Hutch official said, Despite our best efforts (for the city), there are technical and practical limitations to providing quality services in the absence of adequate spectrum. The next round of allocation will be crucial. 

 Now all eyes are on the defence department which is slated to release 40mhz in the 1800mhz band and 50mhz in the 3G band. UBS has warned that delays in the release of spectrum will lead to an uncertainty in operations of operators planning new rollouts and expansion in existing circles. A drop in network quality could also lead to revenue losses, the UBS report said. In Bengal, the service providers are hard pressed to provide quality coverage to major cities outside Calcutta such as Durgapur , Siliguri and Asansol. 

 According to the Trai quality of service report, the benchmark for congestion level at a point of interconnection is less than 0.5 per cent. This means one out of 200 calls between operators will suffer from congestion. The Trai report, a quarterly survey, says the congestion is the worst in the city and Bengal circles. 

 There are eight points of interconnection in the city and seven in the state where the level is more than 40 per cent. Such heavy congestion is not there in Mumbai and Delhi, while only two points of interconnection in Chennai have such a high disturbance.

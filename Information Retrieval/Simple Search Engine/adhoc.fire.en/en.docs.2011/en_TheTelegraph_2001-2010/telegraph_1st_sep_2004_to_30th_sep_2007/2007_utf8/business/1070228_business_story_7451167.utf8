 Industry has big potential

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: The economic survey sees a 10 per cent annual industrial growth rate as eminently achievable. However, it stated that infrastructural impediments, especially in the countrys power sector, would have to be removed for this to happen on a sustained basis.

 The survey pointed out that capacity addition through investments is critical for accelerating growth in industry during the 11th plan (2007-12). The investment scenario looks quite optimistic with rising domestic savings rates and FDI inflows, it added.

 Emphasising the removal of infrastructure constraints, it highlighted power as a key factor for sustained growth of the industrial sector.

 Industrial growth would have been even higher had it not been for the relatively disappointing performance of mining and quarrying, electricity, gas and water supply sectors, the survey said.

 It singled out the manufacturing sector as being largely responsible for the impressive growth of the index of industrial production (IIP), which stood at 10.6 per cent in the April-November period of this fiscal.

 Manufacturing contributed 91.1 per cent to this improved performance and in seven of the eight months of the current year, the year-on-year growth of the sector was in double digits.

 The survey said the growth rates of the mining and electricity sectors continued to lag far behind the overall IIP despite a moderate turnaround in this fiscal compared with the previous year.

 Within the manufacturing sector, nine segments with a combined weight of 44.2 per cent in IIP grew at over 10 per cent on an average during April-November 2006, but leather and fur declined by 3.7 per cent, it said.

 On performance of specific sectors, the survey said electronics and computer technology continued to do well, with hardware and software registering combined exports of Rs 1,11,700 crore in 2005-06. 

 The auto sector registered a growth of 18.04 per cent with production at 53,94,000 units till September 2006.

 State urged to resolve jute strike

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Calcutta, March 6: The Union food ministry has asked the Bengal government for a quick settlement of the indefinite jute strike to make sacks available for packing wheat. The rabi crop is expected to hit the north Indian markets from next week.

 The ministry has threatened to move away from compulsory packaging act and look for alternative materials to pack Punjab wheat expected to be harvested from mid-March. 

 The crop would need immediate packing and the nation cannot wait for the jute industry, the message is believed to have said.

 State labour minister Mrinal Banerjee, who held a day-long conciliation meeting with both mill owners and trade unions, will hold another session tomorrow. Indeed, new crop wheat can not remain unpacked because the jute industry is on strike, Banerjee told The Telegraph.

 Calcutta, Feb. 3: The Bengal government has asked Ernst amp; Young to rework certain portions of the report on the reorganisation of the West Bengal Tea Development Corporation Ltd (WBTDC).

 The restructuring of WBTDC is a DFID-funded project and the state government had appointed Ernst amp; Young to chart the recast plan. WBTDC has five gardens. which employ around 10,000 permanent and temporary workers.

 I have gone through the report and there are certain areas that need to be redone. Therefore, I have asked them to make the changes and resubmit the report, said Sabyasachi Sen, who is the principal secretary in the department of commerce and industry of the Bengal government.

 Certain factions of the tea unions had also written a letter to the state government, stating their areas of disagreement with the consultants report.

 We have already submitted our differences regarding the restructuring programme to the state government. We are not in agreement with the consultants report as we feel that profitability of certain gardens such as Mohua have not been calculated accurately, said Ashu Sarkar, vice-president of Cha Bagaan Mazdoor Union, which has about 900 employees of Hilla under its membership scheme and around 75,000 members in north Bengal.

 The West Bengal Tea Development Corporation was set up in 1976 as a wholly owned government company. Its main objective was to buy out or take over economically viable tea estates that were victim of certain irregularities.

 The company produces orthodox as well as CTC variety at the Darjeeling and Dooars tea estates respectively.

 Initially, WBTDC had taken over the ownership of four sick tea estates, including Rungmook-Cedars (719 hectares), Pandam (382 hectares), Rangaroon (120 hectares) in the district of Darjeeling and Hilla (709 hectares) in the Dooars region of Jalpaiguri district. Mohua (683 hectares) is the tea estate developed by WBTDC in the Dooars region.

 While the Darjeeling variety produced at WBTDC gardens are sold at the Calcutta auction, CTC sells at the Siliguri centre.

 The state government had received a Rs 8-crore package from the central government to develop tea tourism in the two estates of Hilla and Mohua, which are under WBTDC.

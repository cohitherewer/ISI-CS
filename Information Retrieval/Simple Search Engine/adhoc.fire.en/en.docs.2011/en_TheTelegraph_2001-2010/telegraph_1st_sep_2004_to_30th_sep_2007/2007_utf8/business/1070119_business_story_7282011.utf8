 Thapars death condoled

 LM Thapar 

 New Delhi, Jan. 18 (PTI): Industry chambers have expressed anguish over the demise of industrialist Lalit Mohan Thapar and said it has created a vacuum that will be difficult to fill.

 CII president R. Seshasayee said Thapar was a man of great acumen and in his death India has lost a great industrialist, who had built up a reputation for integrity of products.

 The setting up of LM Thapar Center for Competitiveness in Chandigarh was indicative of his foresight for industry, especially the small and medium enterprises, Seshasayee said.

 Assocham president Venugopal Dhoot said he was one of the most admired businessmen who founded Ballarpur Industries and earned for himself a name in the paper industry.

 His contribution for industrialisation will be remembered greatly, Dhoot added.

 Thapar died yesterday from cardiac and renal failure. He was 76.

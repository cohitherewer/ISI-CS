 Calcutta, July 30: The food processing ministry will build 30 food parks across the country. The project, which will have a public-private partnership, will require an investment in infrastructure of Rs 400 crore. The ministrys share in the project will be around Rs 50 crore.

 We want each state to have its own food park with cold storage and market linkage. There are 57 food parks now, of which eight are in Bengal. Unfortunately they are not performing well, as most of them are isolated and lack supporting infrastructure, said Subodh Kant Sahai, Union minister for food processing.

 The parks will have cold storage facilities, logistics and distribution centres. They will be linked to the markets to get better value for farmers.

 Bengal now processes only 1 per cent of its agricultural produce.

 The state received 443 proposals for such parks till 2005-06 involving an investment of Rs 380.9 crore. It received 36 more proposals till November 2006, which require an investment of Rs 180.68 crore.

 The ministry will also set up a food authority. It will be in the lines of Codex, an international food quality and standards body.

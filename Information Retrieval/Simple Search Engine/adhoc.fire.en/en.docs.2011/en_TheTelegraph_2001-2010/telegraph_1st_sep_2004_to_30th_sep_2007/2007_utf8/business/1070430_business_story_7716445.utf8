 Reliance to seek clarity on SEZ cap

 Mumbai, April 29 (PTI): Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries will approach external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, who is the chairman of the empowered group of ministers, to seek clarity on the cap on the size of SEZs with respect to its project in Raigad district.

 We have sought a meeting with Mukherjee, an official of Reliances Mumbai SEZ said. We will inform Mukherjee about our problems and draw his attention to the fact that a cap on the size of the SEZ will have an adverse impact on the project.

 For a project of this scale, size is very important. Nowhere in the world is there a cap on the size of SEZs. Some in China are over 300 sq km, he added.

 The Union commerce ministry had also written to the EGoM seeking clarity on the cap. The official said, We plan to make a presentation before Mukherjee, explaining our stand.

 The EGoM had recommended a cap of 5,000 hectares on the size of SEZs. It also said governments should not intervene in any manner in land acquisition proceedings.

 Reliance has proposed an SEZ of over 9,000 hectares in 45 villages of Raigad. Asked about Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukhs directives to stay land acquisition for the project, the official said, As far as we are concerned, the land acquisition is going on.

 Deshmukhs directives to stop acquisition came after Raigad districts collector D.S. Zagde wrote to the state revenue secretary seeking clear instructions from the government on land acquisitions for the SEZ.

 He said, If we do not complete the entire process, particularly declaration of our intention to acquire land by May 31, the whole process will be declared null and void.

 On March 23, Deshmukh told the legislative council that the state government would not initiate proceedings for the acquisition of land.

 He later said even if the proceedings were in progress, the revenue department would not pass the final award for change of ownership of the land.

 Meanwhile, farmers in areas affected by the project, who stand to benefit from land acquisition rates (Rs 25 lakh per hectare for crop land) announced by Reliance, have started venting their ire against certain political parties, the official said. 

 Earlier, the farmers were angry with the government. Now they are angry with these parties as they feel that due to the hurdles in the way of the project, they may be deprived of a good value for their land, he said.

 Posco sees early end to land row

 More in store

 Calcutta/Bhubaneswar, July 22: Posco plans to complete the acquisition of land in Orissa by the end of this year and start foundation work on its steel plant in the early part of 2008. 

 The Korean giant is setting up a 12 million tonne integrated plant in the state at an investment of Rs 52,000 crore. This is the largest foreign direct investment for a single project in the country.

 Posco hopes to get the mining lease for its plant by the end of this year, the company said in a recent filing before the US Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 It may also start work on port construction early next year. Demarcation and fencing around the proposed site will be done in the next five months. 

 The company has also got environment clearance from the Centre for its port project in April and for the steel unit in June this year. Posco appears to be confident in meeting these targets, but the ground realities are different. 

 The company is yet to get a possession of the land at Jagatsingpur, which is the site of the proposed plant, though more than two years have elapsed since the memorandum of understanding was signed with the Orissa government. 

 Posco has sought 4,004 acres for the plant, to be built in phases. Only 400 acres are private property, while the rest is vested with the state government. Posco has also made a payment for 1,135 acres. 

 However, resistance from a section of the settlers has made it impossible for the government or company employees to enter the area. A few months back, some Posco employees were held up by the protestors when they visited the site. 

 Posco will not only have to make peace with the protesters but also with those who have encroached upon government property. Though the company has offered a rehabilitation package, it is yet to win over the protesters. 

 The mining lease is in a tight spot too: there are some 164 applicants for the Khandadhar mines at Sundergarh district. The state has suggested the possibility of invoking the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act to give preference to Posco, but there are fears over the government getting dragged to the courts, resulting in a further delay in the project. 

 It might also be difficult for the company to get a forest clearance. Over 3,000 acres identified for the project is forest land.

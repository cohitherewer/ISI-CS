 Jet plans $400m rights issue

 Goyal: Big dreams

 Mumbai, May 13 (PTI): Jet Airways is planning a $400-million rights issue to fund its expansion plans and start a cargo service by the year-end.

 Jet Airways chairman Naresh Goyal said, We are looking at a $400-million rights issue, which is expected to be completed in four months and the money would be utilised for funding aircraft acquisition.

 Goyal said the airlines would also honour the commitment made by Air Sahara to acquire 10 Boeing aircraft. Jet had recently acquired Air Sahara for Rs 1,450 crore.

 Where are the planes? there is scarcity of planes. We are going to exercise the options, Goyal told reporters after showcasing a Boeing 777-300 and an Airbus 330-200. Jet has acquired the planes for its international operations.

 Elaborating on the proposal to launch the cargo service, Goyal said the company has already appointed a US-based NRI from American Airlines to oversee the project.

 We hope to launch the full-fledged cargo service by the year-end. Currently, six per cent of our revenue comes from cargo operations and we hope to make it to 10 per cent by the year-end, Goyal said. 

 Goyal said it would need $50 million to bring Sahara up to the mark and added that Jet Airways has already obtained an approval from the government to use the Jetlite brand. The first Jetlite flight will take off within two months.

 He claimed that the operational cost to run Jetlite would be less as the ground and other staff would be same as that of Jet Airways.

 On the rationale for choosing Brussels as its international hub, Goyal said there was no problem of slots in the Belgium capital unlike in other European airports.

 Jet Airways announced Brussels as its European hub on May 2 to connect different points in the US and Canada. This was announced at a function in Brussels.

 The Belgium government has pledged its support by providing necessary assistance, Goyal said.

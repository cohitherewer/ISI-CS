The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 IT industry eyes 50% growth 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 9: The IT industry in Bengal is targeting a growth rate of over 50 per cent this fiscal.

 Last year, the industry grew 46 per cent compared with the national average of 32 per cent.

 In 2005-06, our growth in IT and ITeS exports was 31 per cent while the national average was 36 per cent. Last year, we exceeded the national average and in this fiscal, we want to improve further, Bengal IT minister Debesh Das said at a conference on ITCon-Destination East organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today.

 Bengal aims to become one of the top three states in software exports by 2010.

 The minister also said 37 companies registered with the state last year. This year, the IT department expected 100 companies to set up units in Bengal, he added.

 Around 46 small and medium IT companies have been allotted subsidised land to set up base in New Town, Rajarhat. More such allotments are likely with the government considering setting up IT hubs on the outskirts of the city.

 While most of the subsidies are similar to those given by other state governments, Bengal is the first to offer a training subsidy to small and medium IT companies up to a maximum amount of Rs 20,000 per employee.

 Exports under the STP scheme were worth Rs 3,161 crore in 2006-07 against Rs 2,167 crore in 2005-06.

 Service and software exports from India recorded a 32.6 per cent growth at Rs 139,500 crore in 2006-07.

 The number of companies operating under the STP scheme in the state was 176 compared with 166 in 2005-06.

 The high growth was because of existing companies such as TCS and new entrants GenPact, HSBC and Tech Mahindra.

 Among large companies, revenues of Siemens and Skytech went down. Calcutta is set to have almost 20 million sq ft of IT office space in the next two to three years, which will require 2 lakh trained personnel.

 Former Home Depot boss to drive Chrysler 

 Nardelli: Lead role

 Detroit/Chicago, Aug. 6 (Reuters): Cerberus Capital Management on Monday named former Home Depot Inc chief executive Robert Nardelli as chairman and chief executive of Chrysler LlC in a managerial shake-up just after the private equity firm completed a deal to acquire the struggling No. 3 US auto maker.

 Chryslers current chief executive, Tom LaSorda, will stay on as president and vice-chairman and continue to lead ongoing talks with the United Auto Workers union as the automakers No. 2 executive and a consultant to Cerberus.

 In a further shake-up, Chryslers current chief operating officer, Eric Ridenour, will leave and his post, responsible for production and product planning, will not be filled.

 Chrysler has many deeply talented and dedicated people, and I am confident that together we can continue the momentum of Chryslers recovery and return this great American icon to the path of global growth and competitiveness, Nardelli said in a statement.

 The leadership reshuffle comes after Cerberus closed its $7.4-billion acquisition of an 80.1 per cent stake in Chrysler from former parent Daimler on Friday and underscored both the speed at which the private equity firm was moving to rescue the loss-making auto maker and the risks it faces.

 The changes come at a sensitive time for Chrysler, which is locked in negotiations with the UAW aimed at reducing its hourly labour costs to make it competitive with Japanese rivals led by Toyota Motor Corp.

 In Nardelli, Chrysler is getting a former senior General Electric executive, who was both credited with overhauling purchasing and technology systems at Home Depot and widely criticised for pay and severance packages seen as excessive.

 This is an interesting choice, and Im somewhat perplexed by it, said Erich Merkle, an auto industry analyst with IRN Inc. There are still things that Chrysler needs long term and Im not sure Nardelli can provide them.

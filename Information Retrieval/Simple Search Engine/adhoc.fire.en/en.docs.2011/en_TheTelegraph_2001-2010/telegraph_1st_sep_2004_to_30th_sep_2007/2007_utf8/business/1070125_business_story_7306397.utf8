 Calcutta, Jan. 24: Four more ultra-mega power projects of 4,000 mega watt (mw) capacity each will be awarded to private developers within this calendar year, said Shyam Wadhera, director (projects), Power Finance Corporation (PFC). 

 The public sector finance company is the nodal agency for awarding nine ultra-mega power projects on build-own-operate basis through competitive tariff-based bidding. 

 The government has already identified the nine projects, each with a capacity of 4,000 mw. Two of these one in Sasan, Madhya Pradesh, and the other in Mundra, Gujarat have been awarded to Singapores Globeleq and Lanco Infratech consortium and Tata Power respectively early this month. 

 Four more one each in Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Orissa and Tamil Nadu will be awarded within this calendar year, said Wadhera. 

 All the nine ultra-mega power projects are coal based. Of these, four will be pit-head projects with coal from captive mines. The remaining five will use imported coal and will be set up along the coasts. For the Krishnapatnam project in Andhra Pradesh, we have received requests for qualification (RFQs) from 17 parties. However, only 13 of them will qualify for bidding and we hope that by mid-March, the selection processes will be over, Wadhera said. 

 This will be followed by the Tilaiya project in Jharkhand for which the expressions of interest will be invited from January 31 and the letter of intent (LoI) will be given to successful bidders expectedly in June. The IB Valley project in Orissa and the Tadri project in Tamil Nadu will come up for bidding next, he added. 

 PFC, which is coming out with its initial public offering on January 31 at a price band of Rs 73 and Rs 85, has also been entrusted by the government (which currently owns 100 per cent equity in it) to set up five special purpose vehicles (SPVs) for ultra-mega power projects to expedite the process of awarding them to private developers. 

 PFC has formed six subsidiaries in 2006 and one early this month with a token equity of Rs 5 lakh each.

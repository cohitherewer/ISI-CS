 Mittal beats Indian CEOs

 Mittal: Big bucks

 New Delhi/London, May 2 (PTI): NRI steel magnate Lakshmi N. Mittal earned over $3.6 million as the CEO of Mittal Steel, which is over 33 times the income of a CEO in India.

 Mittal earned $2 million in basic salary and $1.6 million in performance-related incentives in 2006, Mittal Steel said in its annual report to shareholders.

 In addition, Mittal got 100,000 shares as options, which are worth about $1.8 million in 2006.

 He now holds 440,000 shares as options, valued at over $8 million.

 According to HR consultancy firm Mercer, the income of an Indian CEO is around $111,510. Mittals basic salary of about $2 million is more than 22 times the basic salary in India.

 A Mercer survey says Indian CEOs earn the lowest in Asia, with a basic salary of $89,759 and incentives of $111,510.

 The huge gap exists despite Mittal taking a cut in his basic salary of $189,000 from about $2.2 million in 2005. 

 He also did not get any performance-related incentives in 2005.

 Mittals net worth was put at over $32 billion by the US-based business magazine Forbes. He is the fifth richest person in the world and the richest in both India and the UK.

 After being named as the CEO of Arcelor Mittal, the company formed after Mittal Steel acquired Arcelor for over $33 billion, Mittals income should only go up.

 Mittals son Aditya, who is the chief financial officer of Mittal Steel, took home a basic salary of $942,000 in 2006, which is 10 times more than in India.

 Aditya also earned performance-related incentives of $1.6 million last year, taking his pay packet to over $2.5 million, 22 times higher than in India.

 The Mittal Steel CFO, whose basic salary dropped from $1.2 million in 2005, also received 75,000 shares as options last year. He now holds $4.9 million as options.

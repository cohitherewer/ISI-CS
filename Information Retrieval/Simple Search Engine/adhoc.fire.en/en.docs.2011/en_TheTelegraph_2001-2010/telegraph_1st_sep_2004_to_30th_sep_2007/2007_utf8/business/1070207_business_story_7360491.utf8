 Fresh row erupts over FLAG cable

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 6: The battle between Flag Telecom Group (FLAG) and Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) over the landing rights of the FLAG Europe Asia cable renewed today when FLAG claimed a monetary relief of $406 million plus interest from VSNL, citing opportunity cost.

 FLAG and VSNL have been embroiled in a battle for the last three years over the FLAG Europe Asia cable system, the landing station of which is in VSNLs premises at Mumbai. FLAG has alleged that VSNL levies an access charge on its customers, which was 166 times higher than that charged by the Tata firm in the Tyco Global Network (TGN) landing station at Los Angeles. The high access charges were hurting the competitiveness of the Indian ITeS, BPO and KPO enterprises.

 The company has also said if VSNL allows upgrading of the FLAG Europe Asia landing station in Mumbai, it would be able to add 140 GB of international bandwidth at a low gestation period and marginal costs that would help customers. In May last year, an Arbitration Tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) had, by a partial award by a 2:1 majority, ordered VSNL to grant FLAG access to the Mumbai cable landing station to install, inspect, test, train and perform other functions to equip capacity of the FLAG Europe Asia cable system to any level.

 FLAG has also alleged VSNL of not abiding to the letter and spirit of the judgment of the tribunal by not allowing it to upgrade the landing station in Mumbai.

 FLAG is now claiming that since it has not been allowed to upgrade the station, it has suffered an opportunity cost of at least $406 million.

 VSNL has informed the bourses about the communication from FLAG seeking monetary relief of about $406 million plus interest in the arbitration relating to the dispute regarding the interpretation of the construction and maintenance agreement governing the FLAG Europe Asia cable system.

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: Kingfisher Airlines plans to start its US operations with flights to San Francisco and New York by April next year.

 The company has sought permission from the US department of transportation two weeks ago and may use the flying rights of Air Deccan in which it has a 26 per cent stake.

 Vijay Mallya, chairman and managing director of Kingfisher Airlines, said here today, If everything goes well, we plan to fly to San Francisco and New York by April 2008.

 Mallya has been lobbying for relaxation in current government norms that allow airlines to fly abroad only if they have five years experience and a fleet of 20 aircraft. 

 Government officials said the norms may be relaxed by a group of ministers which is deliberating on the civil aviation policy.

 Even in the absence of easier rules, Kingfisher Airlines can fly abroad from the middle of next year. 

 Air Deccan will be five years old in 2008. If the norms are not relaxed, we will fly Air Deccan, Mallya said. Kingfisher Airlines started operations only in 2005.

 An option before Mallya is to co-brand Air Deccan flights with Kingfisher Airlines.

 UB (Holdings) owns 83 per cent in two-year-old Kingfisher Airlines. It also bought a 26 per cent stake in budget carrier Deccan Aviation in June this year for Rs 550 crore and has made an open offer to buy another 20 per cent. Mallya said UB planned to double its stake in Deccan Aviation to 51 per cent.

 Air Deccan chairman G.R. Gopinath said the low-cost airline planned to increase fares by Rs 500-1,000 and expected to break even by the next financial year.

 We (Air Deccan) have to be profitable in our operations. It is in the interest of consumers and the industry, Gopinath said on the sidelines of a marketing summit organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.

 He, however, did not reveal a time-frame for raising fares. I can do it (hike prices) tomorrow if consumers are willing to pay. All that I am saying is that all airlines will have to increase prices to remain competent. 

 Air Deccan has not set a target date for profitability but expects to break even between April and June of next year. To a query on whether Air Deccan was open to co-branding with Kingfisher Airlines, Gopinath said, We would do everything needed to help Kingfisher fly abroad. We can also look at co-branding if need be.

 On Mallya increasing his stake in Air Deccan, Gopinath said The law permits him to acquire an additional 20 per cent with no upper limits and he chose the minimum. 

 Gopinath, however, said he would continue to remain the chairman of Air Deccan, as specified in an agreement with Kingfisher Airlines.

 He said Air Deccan was open to an image makeover after its acquisition by Kingfisher Airlines. To bring a common identity, Air Deccan colours may change in line with Kingfisher. We will do all that is required to change the perception of the brand and become the number one low-cost carrier in the country.

 Energiser for power exchange

 Mumbai, July 21 (PTI): National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange Ltd (NCDEX) is setting up a power exchange in a joint venture with the NTPC and NHPC at an estimated cost of Rs 15-20 crore.

 We have received formal approval for setting up the exchange. We expect more players to join us as joint venture partners. All JV partners will get an equal share in equity participation, NCDEX managing director and CEO P.H. Ravikumar told reporters here today. 

 Other partners for the exchange include the Power Grid Corporation of India and the Power Finance Corporation.

 NCDEX has applied for necessary clearances from the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) and expects to get them by September, he said.

 The regulator is finalising the norms to set up the exchanges, after which a formal approval for the power exchanges may be given. Power exchanges have been proposed by the government to develop a transparent market for power trading.

 The CERC had in February issued guidelines for granting permission to operators wanting to set up and operate a power exchange in the country. It proposed multiple power exchanges. 

 A power exchange will function on the lines of a commodity exchange and provide a platform for buyers, sellers and traders of electricity to enter into spot and forward contracts.

 It will offer a market-based institution to provide price discovery and price risk management to the generators, distribution licensees, traders, consumers and other players in the sector.

 The Power Trading Corporation said it would pick up a 26 per cent stake in the Indian Energy Exchange, the power exchange floated by the Multi-Commodity Exchange.

 Meanwhile, NCDEX is betting big on energy initiatives for its growth. After its presence in brent crude and furnace oil in the futures market, it is looking at spot market trading in natural gas, petroleum products and coal.

 NCDEX proposes to launch a spot exchange platform with GAIL for trading in natural gas, which is a big opportunity, said Ravikumar. It will benefit gas producers, consumers, importers and the government, he added.

 NCDEX has tied up with Metaljunction to launch spot and futures trading in coal. India is the third-largest producer of coal in the world, he said.

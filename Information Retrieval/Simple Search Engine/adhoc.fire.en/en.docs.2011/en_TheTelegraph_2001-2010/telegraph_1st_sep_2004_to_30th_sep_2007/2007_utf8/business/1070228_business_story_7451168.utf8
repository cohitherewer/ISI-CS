 Deficit stunner in offing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: Finance minister P. Chidambaram may succeed in pulling off a fiscal deficit surprise for the second year running. Record tax collections coupled with lower spending may help him beat his own target. 

 The deficit as a proportion of gross domestic product may work out to 3.6 per cent, instead of the targeted 3.8 per cent, according to finance ministry officials.

 A 9.2 per cent GDP growth has boosted revenue collections, which grew by over nearly a third during the first nine months of the year instead of by a targeted 19 per cent. 

 During this period, nearly 70 per cent of the budgeted amount has been collected, according to the economic survey. 

 Gross tax revenue for the nine month period went up to Rs 3,06,527 crore against a total expenditure of Rs 383,721 crore and the previous years April-December gross tax revenue of Rs 230,839 crore.

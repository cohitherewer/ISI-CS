 Calcutta, Jan. 21: Keventer Agro will open a Rs 70-crore common facility food processing centre in Barasat, North 24 Parganas. Retail giants such as Reliance, Pantaloons and Metro Cash amp; Carry would process their agro products in this centre.

 Union minister of food processing, Subodh Kant Sahai, said the investment is the first of its kind in the country. The unit would begin operations from April 15, 2007. The unit comes close on the heels of the proposed Rs 2,500-crore food park project in Sankrail. 

 We have been working on this model for the past three years. We had appointed consultants from China, Germany and Poland who specialise in such projects. This centre will provide facilities such as cold storage, curing, treating, 48 kinds of packaging and temperature-controlled vans, Keventer Agro chairman M.K. Jalan said.

 The facility will process 550 tonnes of fruits, vegetables and staple daily with a capacity to load 50 lorries simultaneously. Discussions are also on with ITC, which may like to use the facility for its agro-business.

 Metro and Reliance will source their own produce and get it processed from this centre. Keventer will be doing the sourcing for Pantaloons. Trials are already on with Big Bazaar.

 Keventer works with 3,200 farmers across 7,000 acres in North 24 Parganas for banana, vegetables and gherkin cultivation. It will also begin work on cereal farming soon. Keventers 100 per cent subsidiary, Keventer Fresh Ltd, manages this project.

 This Keventer Fresh facility, spread across 200 acres in Barasat, will also house the processing units, including fruit, vegetable and juice processing plants, for the Keventer Fresh brand. The common facility will be spread over an area of 2.5 lakh sq ft.

 The company is also in talks with Multi Commodity Exchange, National Multi-Commodity Exchange and National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange.

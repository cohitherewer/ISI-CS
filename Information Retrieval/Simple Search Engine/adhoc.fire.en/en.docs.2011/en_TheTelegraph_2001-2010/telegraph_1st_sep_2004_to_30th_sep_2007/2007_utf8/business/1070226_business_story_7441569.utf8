 Orissa gets tough with Reliance Energy over arrears 

 PRABUDDHA S. JAGADEB

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 25: Anil Ambanis plans for a 12,000-megawatt thermal power plant in Orissa may have hit a roadblock.

 A task force of the state government has recommended that Ambanis Reliance Energy Ltd (REL) first clear its arrears to the Orissa government before signing a memorandum of understanding for the power project.

 In September last year, REL was due to sign an MoU with the state government for the coal-fired power plant at Hirma in Jharsuguda district at an investment of about Rs 48,000 crore. 

 The MoU, however, was not signed as the state government and REL could not reach an agreement on payment of RELs arrears of over Rs 540 crore towards power bonds.

 REL manages three power distribution companies Wesco, Southco and Nesco. These companies were previously with Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Company (BSES), which took control when the power distribution sector was privatised in Orissa. 

 REL holds a 51 per cent stake in these companies. But the company has not serviced interest on the Rs 400-crore bonds pledged to the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC). 

 Before REL took over the management of the three distribution companies, BSES in 2001 had issued bonds worth Rs 400 crore at a 12.5 per cent interest in favour of Gridco to cover its arrears. 

 Gridco in turn pledged the BSES bonds to NTPC. After taking over BSES, REL had to service the bonds and the accruing interest of Rs 140 crore on time, according to the shareholders agreement.

 The task force, headed by retired IAS officer Vivek Patnaik, has recommended that the MoU for the Hirma project be inked only after REL redeems the Rs 400-crore bonds and signs the shareholding agreements. 

 It has recommended that REL should pay back all its outstanding dues over the bonds as a one-time settlement by taking a bank loan, it should sign a shareholders agreement with Gridco and it should invest Rs 150 crore over the next three years in the distcos it operates, energy minister Surya Patro told The Telegraph.

 REL owes around Rs 2,164 crore to Gridco for power purchase. However, Patro said the committee has considered the outstanding dues of REL only in power bonds. 

 I would not comment on other dues of REL, said Patro, adding that the issue is under purview of courts and the Electricity Appellate Tribunal.

 Orissa has 61 billion tonnes of coal reserves, which can sustain power generation of 100,000 mw for a century.

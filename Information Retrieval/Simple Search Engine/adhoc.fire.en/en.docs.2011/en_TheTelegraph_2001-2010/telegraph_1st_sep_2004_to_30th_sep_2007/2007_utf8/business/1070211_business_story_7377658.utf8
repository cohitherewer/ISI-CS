 US wants India to lead from front at Doha

 Washington, Feb. 10 (PTI): The United States has asked India to make tangible offers at the WTO and provide leadership to the developing nations to conclude the Doha round of trade talks, which re-started last week.

 We believe that Indias leadership is required if we want a breakthrough and get a good agreement, the kind that will generate prosperity throughout the world, US commerce secretary Carlos Gutierrez said ahead of his February 13-14 visit to India.

 I do want to impress upon the government officials that without Indias leadership, we cant do it, he said.

 While asking India to offer more concessions on agriculture, industrial goods and services, Gutierrez said developing countries look to India to play the leader and they want to see India moving before they move (on offering concessions).

 Asked if the US will be bringing more to the table on farm subsidies, he claimed that Washington already has an aggressive proposal.

 We dont want to be in a position where we are negotiating with ourselves. We have put the attractive proposal forward and it is still there and interestingly it continues to be the most aggressive one, he said. 

 When asked whether the tough stand taken by New Delhi at the WTO would result in reduction of benefits that exports of certain items from India to US get, Gutierrez said, We are not linking Doha to the generalised system of preferences (GSP). It is a separate issue, which requires congressional approval, but the key focal point right now is Doha.

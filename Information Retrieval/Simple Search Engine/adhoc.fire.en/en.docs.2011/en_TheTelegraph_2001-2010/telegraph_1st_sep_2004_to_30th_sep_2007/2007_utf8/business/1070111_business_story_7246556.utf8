 Calcutta, Jan. 10: BSNL is considering making voice calls free for broadband subscribers who would also opt for its Internet protocol television (IPTV) services to be launched in April.

 Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) is set to invest Rs 30 crore for a citywide rollout of IPTV for a target base of 2.25 lakh customers. It has lined up a soft launch in February and will offer the service commercially from April.

 Under the IPTV service, subscribers will have triple play connections voice, data and TV through one broadband connection.

 After the introduction of IPTV services at just Rs 200, we will study the usage pattern of our existing broadband subscribers in the city for three months. Depending on their usage in terms of data requirement, we might consider making voice calls free for our existing broadband customers, said S.K. Chakravarty, chief general manager, BSNL, Calcutta Telephones, at a meeting organised by the Merchants Chamber of Commerce.

 We will have a minimum billing for a customer to avail of the free voice calls, he said.

 The idea is to garner revenue from data so that voice calls could be offered for free.

 BSNL has recently upgraded its broadband service from 256 kbps to 2 mbps, an increase by eight times for free for all broadband subscribers. This will enable IPTV to broadcast up to 100 channels, which should aid better data usage, he said.

 The company also plans to introduce a prepaid card system for fixed-line post-paid subscribers.

 This would be a special system wherein the subscribers would only have to pay the monthly rental while the calls could be made through prepaid cards, Chakravarty said.

 This would entail a special registration system, which would rule out keying in a 16-digit pin number with every dial.

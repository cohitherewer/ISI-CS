 Duty cut brings cheer to beer guzzlers

 KAKOLY CHATTERJEE

New Delhi, July 8: The cut in the duty on imported beer is expected to see the prices of foreign brands such as Heineken, Carlsberg and Tiger coming down by as much as 20 per cent.

 While basic duties remain the same at 100 per cent for the alcoholic beverage, the additional duty of 75 per cent has been scrapped. Consequently, imported beer will cost less by Rs 15 to Rs 20.

 Essentially, a bottle of Heineken which earlier retailed at Rs 100 would now be available for Rs 80, said Adil Mehra, managing director of GTFT an importer of beer, wine and hard liquor.

 However, with domestic prices ranging between Rs 30 and Rs 55, the 20 per cent reduction in imported beer prices would not bring any drastic shift in consumer preferences.

 There will not be any considerable shift in consumer preference as domestic beer continues to be available at cheaper rates, said Rohit Mehra, MD of Mohan Brothers Private Limited.

 For brewers in India, the growing middle and upper middle class represents a lucrative market. More people are taking to alcoholic beverages with changing tastes and lifestyles. 

 Beer, being low in alcohol content, is often the preferred drink of the younger generation. 

 The more affluent and widely travelled people among this section often prefer foreign brands.

 Subhash Arora, founder of the Delhi Wine Club, said, With increased disposable income and refined tastes, sales of imported beer are going to increase. The market is set to grow at 15 per cent per annum.

 Analysts said the Indian beer market was around 8 million hectolitres per annum which works out to a per capita consumption of less than 1 litre against 18 litres per annum in China. 

 The Rs 8,000-crore plus domestic market, which is growing at 30 per cent annually, is mainly controlled by United Breweries and SABMiller, who together have about 25 breweries under their fold.

 Breweries such as Mohan Meakins, Mount Shivalik, Yuksom Breweries, Devan Modern Breweries and Asia Pacific Breweries control nearly 18 per cent of the domestic market.

 However, beer imports, which have been eased by lower taxes may actually be hit by big brands deciding to set up base in India.

 Sources said global majors such as Heineken and Anheuser might launch their products in India some time in the future encouraged by the growing market. 

 The current trend shows Indians are drinking more and more beer. Several factors are seen as driving this growth, including a buoyant economy, young population and a change in the licensing system.

 With the Indian beer industry poised for a 30 per cent growth in the next two to three years, global players are getting ready to grab a larger pint, said Arora.

 But if foreign brands are planning to make a pitch for Indian guzzlers, existing players such as United Breweries and SABMiller are also planning to widen their range.

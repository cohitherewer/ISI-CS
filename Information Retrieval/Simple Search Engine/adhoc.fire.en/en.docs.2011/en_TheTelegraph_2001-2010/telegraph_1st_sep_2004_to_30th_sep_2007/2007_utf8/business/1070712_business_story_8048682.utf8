 Mumbai, July 11: A strong rupee flipped Infosys numbers in the first quarter but the good news is that it may not deflate the technology titans forecasts in the next quarter. 

 Foreign exchange pundits dont expect the rupee which has risen by over 11 per cent in the past 12 months to pump more iron in the days ahead.

 Infosys lowered its full-year earnings per share (EPS) forecast to Rs 78.20-79 from Rs 80.29-81.58 it had estimated in April, reflecting the appreciating rupee. Similarly, the income estimate for the year ended March 31, 2008 was lowered to Rs 16,238 crore to Rs 16,433 crore compared with the earlier forecast of at least Rs 17,038 crore.

 The company made this new guidance on the basis of an exchange rate of Rs 40.58 per dollar. Back in April, it had forecast its first-quarter numbers on an assumed exchange rate of Rs 43.10.

 During the quarter ended June 30, the Indian currency had appreciated nearly 7 per cent against the dollar on strong inflows and lack of aggressive intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). For Infosys, which derives more than 98 per cent of its income from exports, the rise smacked its margins.

 Experts point out that for every percentage rise in value of the Indian currency, margins of companies like Infosys get impacted to the tune of 50 basis points. Therefore, the rupees rise of nearly 7 per cent during the period saw its margin getting hit by around 350 basis points.

 Although the rupee has caught Infosys on the wrong foot on the past three occasions, forex experts feel that this time the company may not be far off the mark. 

 We do not see the rupee appreciating significantly from here on. On the contrary, it should hit the Rs 41-mark by August. A Rs 37-38 levels against the dollar is highly unlikely, a forex analyst from a private sector bank said.

 The rupee today ended at 40.41 against the dollar about four paise weaker from previous close of 40.38 on dollar buying by banks. But the bad news is that the greenback has continued to weaken. On Wednesday, it hit a record low against the euro and a 26-year low against the sterling as fears escalated about the US sub-prime mortgage sector. Earlier, two credit rating agencies had issued warnings on bonds linked to risky mortgages.

 Even with the anticipated higher dollar inflows from foreign institutional investors and export earning companies, analysts dont see the rupee rising because the Reserve Bank is expected to intervene if the rupee hardens further. 

 The central bank has so far not been aggressively intervening in the markets as it has been concerned about its impact on inflation. If the central bank scoops up dollars, it will have to pump in rupees into the financial system, thereby stoking inflationary pressures. Inflation has now dipped to 4.13 per cent from over 6 per cent earlier and remain well within the RBI-mandated band of 5 to 5.5 per cent for the year.

 Exporters have been mauled by a rising rupee and have been pressuring the government to rein it in. After textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, pharmaceuticals, Infosys results has shown that the IT sector has also been hit. Therefore, the government may announce some more measures to curb the rupees rise, an analyst said.

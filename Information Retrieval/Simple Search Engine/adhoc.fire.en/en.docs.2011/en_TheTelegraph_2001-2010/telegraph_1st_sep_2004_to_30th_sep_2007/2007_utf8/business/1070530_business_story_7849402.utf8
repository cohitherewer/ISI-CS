 Vodafone turns aggressive

 Mission India

 Mumbai, May 29: Vodafone will invest 1 billion (over Rs 8,000 crore) in India this year, which is 20 per cent of its worldwide capital expenditure. 

 The British telecom giant has recently acquired a controlling stake in Hutchison Essar.

 The investment is a sign of the significance of India in Vodafones global plans. There are 25 countries where Vodafone offers its services.

 While announcing its annual results for the year ended March 31, 2007, Vodafone said it had fared well in the emerging markets. The acquisition of Hutchison Essar will expand its presence in high-growth markets across the world.

 The company said its capital expenditure globally this year would be 4.7-51 billion. Last year, it had invested 4.2 billion.

 With market penetration still around 14 per cent and a population of over 1.1 billion, India provides a very significant opportunity for future growth, Arun Sarin, CEO, Vodafone, said in a statement after announcing the results. 

 A priority this year is to expand in India and capture the growth opportunity offered by the country.

 Analysts said other Indian telecom companies would also invest heavily this year.

 Most of them have invested between Rs 5,000 crore and Rs 6,000 crore in the past two years, and they plan to invest more in this fiscal. Reliance Communications has a capital expenditure programme of Rs 10,000 crore in this fiscal, up from Rs 6,700 crore in the last year.

 The investment will be made in various business segments, but the bulk will be in wireless. 

 Bharti Airtel has announced a capital expenditure plan of $3-3.5 billion this year, with 75 per cent of the outlay in wireless.

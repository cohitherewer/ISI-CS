 MNCs face stiff domestic test

 New York, June 5 (PTI): India provides lucrative investment opportunities to foreign companies because of its strong fundamentals, but the companies here can be tough competitors as they are growing at a fast pace, a report has said.

 A Societe Generale report The India Factor, released by the minister of state for industries, Ashwani Kumar yesterday said India has a strong growth rate, high savings rate and a diversified economy and provides opportunities for MNCs in construction, telecom, banking and consumer goods sectors. However, it warned the MNCs of tough competition they could face in the country as Indian companies are likely to expand their market share both at home and abroad.

 We are already seeing this with IT services and pharmaceuticals and can expect further competition from Indias new global players in automobiles and components, metals and mining and oil and gas, among other sectors, the investment banker said in the report.

 Indias expansion, therefore, combines both risks and opportunities for the western companies, it added.

 India has opened up almost all sectors to foreign participation and a combination of high growth rates, rich talent and growing domestic market is turning it into a land of opportunity for foreign investors and companies.

 The European companies comprise 50 per cent of all multinationals operating in India, it said, predicting that they will significantly step up their effort in the country.

 A significant increase in sourcing, manufacturing, and research and development is expected. The fast-moving and competitive Indian market means that they (companies) must be prepared to invest and capture growth or risk losing out as many did in China, it said.

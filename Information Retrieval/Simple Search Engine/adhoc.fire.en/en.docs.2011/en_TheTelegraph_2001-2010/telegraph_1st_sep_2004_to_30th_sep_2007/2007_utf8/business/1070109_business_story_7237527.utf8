 Mumbai, Jan. 8: Ranbaxy Laboratories may bid for the generic business of Germanys Merck. If successful, the Delhi-based company will become the third-largest generic firm in the world.

 If Ranbaxy throws its hat into the ring, it will be the biggest gambit by any domestic pharmaceutical company. This is because analysts estimate the generic drug business of Merck to be anywhere between $4 billion and $5 billion.

 A Ranbaxy official said, Yes, we are looking at the generic business of Merck. However, it is early days as yet. Ranbaxy was not averse to roping in private equity to fund the acquisition, he added.

 Last week, Merck Generics confirmed it was considering selling its generic drug business. 

 Merck Generics has a strong business with excellent leadership and good growth prospects. However, it will need continued investment to fully realise its potential and strengthen its market presence. In the light of the far-reaching changes in the market, we are considering the divestiture of Merck Generics to a qualified buyer, chief executive Michael Roemer said in a statement.

 Merck Generics sells its products in more than 90 countries and in 2005, it reported sales of 1.8 billion euros.

 However, Ranbaxy will face stiff competition if it bids for the generic division. According to reports, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and Novartis AG are likely to show interest in the company. However, with valuations expected to exceed $4 billion, the company would be careful about the bid amount, sources close to Ranbaxy said.

 Last year, Ranbaxy acquired 96.7 per cent of Terapia from Advent International for $324 million. Terapia is the largest independent generic company in Romania.

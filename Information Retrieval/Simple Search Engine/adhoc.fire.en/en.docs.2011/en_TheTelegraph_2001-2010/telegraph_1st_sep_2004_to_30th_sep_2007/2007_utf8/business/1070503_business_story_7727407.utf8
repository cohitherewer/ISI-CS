 Calcutta, May 2: Tata Sons, promoter of all key companies of the Tata group, has consolidated its stake in Tata Tea.

 The committee of directors, appointed by the board, approved the allotment of 28.10 lakh equity shares of the company of Rs 10 each in favour of Tata Sons on conversion of equivalent warrants.

 The shareholding of Tata Sons and the promoter group in Tata Tea is now up approximately 3 per cent to 35 per cent from 32.34 per cent on March 31, 2007.

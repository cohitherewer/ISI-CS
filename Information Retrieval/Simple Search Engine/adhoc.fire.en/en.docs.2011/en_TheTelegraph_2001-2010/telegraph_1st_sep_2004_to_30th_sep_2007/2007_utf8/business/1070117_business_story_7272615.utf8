 Paswan raises hopes for Chiria aspirants

 Calcutta, Jan. 16: The Union steel ministry has proposed a two-way split for Chiria mines, one of the largest reserves of high-grade iron ore in the world, holding out some hope for private players such as the Mittals and the Tatas.

 Steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan said two-thirds of the 3-billion-tonne Chiria reserve in Jharkhand would remain with the Steel Authority of India (SAIL), while the remaining can be given to private players.

 If accepted by the Jharkhand government, which has so far opposed SAILs control on this high-class ore reserve, this formula may clear the way for a number of big-ticket steel projects in the state, including that of Mittal Steel.

 Mittal Steel had signed an MoU with the Jharkhand government in October 2005, for a 12-million-tonne greenfield steel plant. It had demanded 600 million tonnes (mt) of reserve lease over 30 years.

 However, the state could not identify any mine to its satisfaction. Mittal Steel insisted on a slice of Chiria as it failed to find a proven reserve anywhere else in Jharkhand.

 Perturbed by the delay in the project there, Mittal Steel signed another MoU with Orissa at the end of 2006. Like Mittal Steel, Tata Steel has also proposed an expansion of its Jamshedpur plant to 10mt and is also planning another 12mt greenfield unit.

 Paswan, who was in Calcutta today, said SAIL was also ready to ramp up its capacity to 15mt in Jharkhand.

 We have proposed that mining lease for 1 billion tonnes of reserve should be renewed now. The renewal of the other 1 billion tonnes will be linked to an MoU for bigger capacity in Jharkhand, Paswan said. 

 Revival package

 While flagging off the Rs 440-crore revival process of century-old Bengal Chemical and Pharmaceuticals, Paswan said a rehab package for state- owned fertiliser plants would be put before the cabinet soon.

 This package will include reviving Haldia Fertiliser and Durgapur too.

 Paswan said these plants would be converted to gas- based units.

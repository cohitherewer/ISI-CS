The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Out-of-court deal on HPL looks bleak

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sen: Legal angle

 Calcutta, April 18: The Bengal government has ruled out the possibility of an out-of-court settlement with The Chatterjee Group (TCG) to break the deadlock over Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL).

 The two principal shareholders have been bickering over the management of Bengals second largest company for years and the case is now in Calcutta High Court after being tried at the Company Law Board (CLB).

 When asked if settlement was a possibility, Bengal industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen, who is also a member on the board of HPL, said: Whatever happens will happen in court.

 Sen made the remark at a city hotel where the HPL board met today to review the annual performance of the company and make budget plans for this fiscal. HPL chairman Tarun Das told reporters he had no knowledge of an out-of-court settlement. Managing director Swapan Bhowmik was also present at the press meet.

 The board did not discuss the issue. The shareholders have to take a call on it, Das said. In the past, TCG had maintained it wanted an amicable solution with the government.

 On the companys results, Das lauded the effort of the management for the record profit and sales in 2006-07.

 HPL is now a goldmine, he said, adding that the board was working as a team. 

 However, it is understood that TCG members raised some thorny issues during the meeting. They drew attention to the fact that Project Supermax to raise HPLs capacity by 30 per cent at an investment of Rs 675 crore was being delayed by 15 months leading to an estimated loss of Rs 1,000 crore to HPL. 

 The loss of sales due to the delay in adding capacity, shutdown in the existing plant when the project is on and increase in finance cost will compound the damage, they added. Moreover, TCG members pulled up HPL for failing to meet the budgeted sales and production target in the last fiscal as well.

 ONGC call

 Meanwhile, HPL managing director Swapan Bhowmik is being considered for the top job at ONGC by the search committee of the Public Enterprise Selection Board.

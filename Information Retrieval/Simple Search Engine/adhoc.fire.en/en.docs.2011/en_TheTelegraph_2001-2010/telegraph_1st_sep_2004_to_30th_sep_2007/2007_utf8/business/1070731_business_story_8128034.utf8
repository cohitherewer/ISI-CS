 Stronger rupee boosts IOC net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behuria: All smiles

 New Delhi, July 30: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has reported an 11.09 per cent jump in net profit in the first quarter ended June 30 at Rs 1,468.41 crore against Rs 1,321.82 crore a year ago.

 Gains from rupee appreciation and good refinery margins helped the company make a higher profit this year.

 According to IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria, the company made gains of Rs 726 crore from rupee appreciation. The company also had the highest ever refinery margins, which is the revenue earned from processing every barrel of crude. 

 Average gross refinery margins during the quarter ended June 30 were $10.70 a barrel against $6.70 per barrel a year ago, he said.

 Behuria said the company has suffered net under-realisation of Rs 4,879.49 crore during the April-June period because of non-revision of retail selling prices in line with international rates. 

 We are losing about Rs 90 crore a day on sale of petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene. But for the rupee appreciation the revenue loss would have been almost double, he said. 

 IOC is losing Rs 5.88 a litre on petrol, Rs 4.80 a litre on diesel, Rs 14.63 a litre on kerosene and Rs 189.14 per LPG cylinder, he said. 

 Sales turnover increased 9.5 per cent to Rs 58,205 crore from Rs 53,142 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

 IOCs total income increased 11.74 per cent to Rs 54,553.01 crore in the first quarter from Rs 48,819.68 crore a year ago. Shares of the company closed at Rs 395.15, down 1.74 per cent from its previous close on the BSE today.

 Without the appreciation in the rupee, the daily revenue loss would have been around Rs 130 crore. Loss of petrol sale would have been Rs 10 a litre, diesel Rs 9 per litre, Rs 240 on every LPG cylinder and Rs 17 on every litre of kerosene, said S.V. Narasimhan, director finance of IOC.

 Cairn India losses

 Cairn India, a unit of the UK-based Cairn Energy Plc, has suffered a consolidated net loss of Rs 71.4 crore in the quarter ended June 30.

 The company suffered a loss of Rs 140 crore during the quarter because of a stronger rupee. Its foreign subsidiaries held deposits in dollars, intending to use them for capital imports.

 Cairn India, which listed on the bourses in January, said as it was incorporated last August there were no comparable figures for the year-ago period.

 The company plans to produce oil from its Rajasthan block in 2009.

 We are confident that the government will support the proposal for Cairn India to build a pipeline to transport crude oil from Rajasthan, chief executive Rahul Dhir said.

 Cairn India, in which Malaysias Petronas owns 10 per cent, has targeted a peak oil production of 150,000 barrel per day from the Rajasthan block, which is expected to produce oil for 25 years.

 Private funds for rail freight

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chugging ahead

 Mumbai, July 15: Neptune Orient Lines (NOL), a Singapore-based transportation and logistics company, plans to invest around $60 million in APL IndiaLinx the container rail freight service of APL, its wholly owned subsidiary. 

 The fund will be used to acquire rail licences, roll out rakes and build inland container depots. APL IndiaLinx was launched in May in an alliance with Hindustan Infrastructure Projects and Engineering. 

 The company operates through a container depot between Delhi and Mumbai. The depot offers shippers and third party transportation providers a point of contact to coordinate inland and marine freight.

 Kenneth Glenn, NOLs president for South Asia, said, We are seeking land for depots, and have ordered more rolling stock. We are also in the process of constructing our own depots. By the end of the year, we plan to boost our railway capacity to nine rakes, which will enable us to make 11 round trips every week between the depots in north India and the ports. Glenn added that the Indian container market has been growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 16 per cent over the past five years.

 In the next three years, APL IndiaLinx will set up container terminals at various places in north and central India, including Delhi.

 The company also said that its second train would start operating by July 20. It will start moving refrigerated cargoes from the end of the month. 

 It is also planning to enter container terminal business, landslide logistics, and core liner business. APL IndiaLinxs service between Mumbai and Delhi will save up to two days in transit time for customers moving goods within the country. Since May, a single IndiaLinx train has carried around 1,500 twenty foot equivalent unit on the New Delhi-Mumbai corridor. 

 According to an NOL research, India can miss out on an additional 1-2 per cent of annual GDP growth unless it improves its transportation connections to global supply chains.

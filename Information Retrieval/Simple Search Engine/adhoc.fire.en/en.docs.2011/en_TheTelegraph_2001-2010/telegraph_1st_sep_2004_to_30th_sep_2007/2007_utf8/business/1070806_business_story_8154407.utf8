 CII upbeat on industry report card

 New Delhi, Aug. 5 (PTI): A recent survey by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has revealed that most companies in the manufacturing sector recorded a 10 per cent growth in the April to June quarter.

 In its quarterly industry survey, the CII said out of 101 manufacturing segments, 23 recorded a growth of more than 20 per cent while 27 showed a growth of 10-20 per cent. Nearly 36 segments registered a moderate growth rate between 0 and 10 per cent. 

 However, 14 reported a negative growth. The percentage of segments in each category remained almost constant during the period, which reaffirmed that manufacturing is on track.

 It is good to see that 50 per cent of the manufacturing segment has shown above-moderate growth despite various pressures such as the appreciating rupee and hardening interest rates, CII industry council chairman Satish Kaura said.

 Firms making cold-rolled steel strips, pig iron, textile machinery, industrial gases, electric fans and microwave ovens reported excellent growth during the quarter.

 The electric two-wheeler segment was the latest entrant in the list which reported an exponential growth. The segment grew over 100 per cent during the quarter.

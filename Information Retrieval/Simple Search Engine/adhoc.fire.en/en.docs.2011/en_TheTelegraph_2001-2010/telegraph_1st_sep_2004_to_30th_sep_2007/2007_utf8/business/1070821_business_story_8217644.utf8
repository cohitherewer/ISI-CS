 JSW Steel lines up US acquisitions

 Jindal: Western venture

 Calcutta, Aug. 20: Sajjan Jindal-run JSW Steel Ltd is set to announce tomorrow the acquisition of two US-based units owned by elder brother Prithviraj Jindal.

 The deal is for a plate mill and a pipe facility and is valued in the region of $1 billion.

 In a notice to stock exchanges, the company said the board of directors would meet tomorrow to evaluate the feasibility of acquiring a plate mill and a pipe unit, based on due diligence reports of various international agencies.

 Though the company did not disclose the target company, sources said the board would ratify the acquisition of two manufacturing units for pipes and plates of Jindal Saw Ltd. The units are at Baytown in Texas, just 30 kilometres outside Houston, the global hub of oil and gas business.

 The pipe mill has a capacity of 500,000 tonnes, while the plate unit has a capacity of 1,200,000 tonnes.

 Sources said JSW Steels move pointed to the adoption of a production strategy that was similar to the one being followed by Tata Steel for Corus Group Plc.

 JSW Steel will send low-cost slabs, to be manufactured by its plant at Vijaynagar, Karnataka, and at the upcoming unit in Salboni, Bengal, for value addition to the US.

 Jindal Saw now procures plates from the US and other countries. 

 JSW Steel is expected to gain from synergies offered by the integration exercise, encompassing low-cost primary steel facilities in developing countries and finished mills at mature, high-priced markets of developed countries.

 Jindal Saw has a well established marketing network in the US as well.

 JSW Steel is now in the process of expanding the capacity of the Vijaynagar plant to 6.8mt from 2.8mt. 

 The long-term plan is to ramp up the capacity to 10mt.

 The company is also setting up a 10mt plant at Salboni in Bengal with the first phase, involving production of 3mt, going onstream in 3-4 years. 

 JSW Steel plans to build a dedicated berth at Haldia port, to export slab and import raw materials such as coking coal.

 The JSW board may also take up the possibility of acquiring a large chunk of land in Mumbai.

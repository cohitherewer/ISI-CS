 Premium cut likely for life covers

 Calcutta, June 13: A higher life expectancy is likely to reduce the premium in life insurance policies.

 Febien Jeudy, the chief actuary of Birla Sun Life Insurance Company, expects premium rates to be reduced next year for without-profit products such as term assurance, annuity and unit-linked plans. These schemes do not have bonuses.

 For with profit products, such as the traditional endowment or money-back plan, insurers may raise the annual bonus instead of revising the premium rates. 

 So far, life insurers have been following LICs mortality and morbidity table 1994-96 for their product pricing. Mortality charges are calculated on a monthly basis as a percentage of the sum assured. The rates for the different age groups are set out in the mortality table. The rate increases with the age of the policy holder.

 According to G.N. Bajpai, former chairman of LIC, premium rates reflect the mortality rates based on the latest available investigation results.

 The average life expectancy, which was 57 years in 1990, improved to 59 in 1995 and to 64.71 in 2002. It is estimated to be 68.6 this year.

 R. Kannan, member actuary of IRDA, said: We have asked insurance companies, the Life Insurance Council and the Actuarial Society of India to prepare a new mortality and morbidity table in keeping with the latest figures.

 The table is likely to be ready in a year. All insurers will then follow the revised rates. In all likelihood, the mortality charges will come down, Kannan said. Many private life insurers are already charging less than 100 per cent of the LIC mortality table (1994-96) rates and the IRDA has approved these prices, he added.

 Birla Sun Life Insurance is charging less than 80 per cent of the LIC table rates for its Ulips. We will take a relook at our premium rates once the new table is available, Jeudy said. ICICI Prudential Lifes chief actuary Azim Mithani said, We have factored in the improvements in mortality in our product pricing and will not reduce the charges for now. We will take a call when the new table is out. Initially, the premium rates of term assurance plans and Ulips will be reduced.

 That the improvements in life expectancy are being factored in is evident from the intensely competitive rates offered in the group insurance products, said Bryce Johnes, chief investment officer of Kotak Life Insurance. 

 However, lifestyle changes have increased the incidence of cancer, heart disease and diabetes. This makes pricing health and disability products tricky, he added.

 However, the overall premium rate may not decrease significantly as these are determined by three factors: the mortality rate, expenses on management and the prevailing interest rate. 

 Private sector insurers have been around for a maximum of seven years. The cost of acquiring business is quite high for us, particularly from smaller towns. But competitive pricing will drive down other components of premium rates, said Trevor Bull, MD of Tata AIG Life.

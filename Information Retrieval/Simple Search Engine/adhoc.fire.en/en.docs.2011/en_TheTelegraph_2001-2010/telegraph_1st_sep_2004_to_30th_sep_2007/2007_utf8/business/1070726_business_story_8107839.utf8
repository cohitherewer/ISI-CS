 New Delhi, July 25: State-run Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) is ready for talks with ArcelorMittal to explore synergies between the two companies.

 We are open to discussion with ArcelorMittal on technological cooperation and exchange of personnel. Both have something to learn from each other, SAIL chairman S. K. Roongta said after releasing his companys first-quarter results here today. 

 However, later in the day, L.N. Mittal refused to say if he was willing to consider the synergy offer. 

 ArcelorMittal and SAIL will rival each other in the domestic market once the Mittals set up the two proposed 10-12-million-tonne steel plants in Orissa and Jharkhand.

 Roongta, however, said SAIL was open to cooperation with other major steel makers too. 

 Profit up

 SAILs profits for the first quarter this year rose to Rs 1,525 crore from Rs 1,386 crore in April-June 2006.

 The SAIL chairman said profits rose partly on the back of higher production and partly because of higher prices. 

 A huge demand from construction and auto makers in India and China has kept global steel prices firm. 

 Analysts expect prices to remain stable for the next few months. 

 However, SAIL, which lowered prices for some products by Rs 1,000 a tonne earlier this month, expects prices to improve from October.

 SAILs shares declined 4.82 per cent to Rs 153 today as investors who had bought shares through the week in expectation of good results sold them to rake in profits.

 The companys sales reached a record 2.5 million tonnes and hot metal output rose 6 per cent to a record 3.8 million tonnes. SAIL earned 10 per cent more on an average compared with a year ago. 

 Bhilai Steel Plant reported the highest profit of Rs 1,029 crore, Bokaro came second with a profit of Rs 580 crore, Rourkela and Durgapur posted profits of Rs 244 crore and Rs 227 crore respectively.

 MF returns beat sensex

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, Sept. 26: The rah-rah days of 2005 arent back as yet, but mutual funds still have reason to rejoice this year: Their average returns are better than a year ago.

 The paradox is that the sensex returns were a lot better a year ago than they are now.

 The average return from the equity-diversified class of funds has increased from 30.8 on September 26, 2006, to 40.39 today. In contrast, the sensex return has tumbled from 44.52 a year ago to 37.16 today.

 With the market starting to boom this year, the equity mutual funds are showing some sprightly returns though they had wobbled badly in March this year (see chart).

 If the market continues to hold its ground over the next three months, the equity-diversified funds will outperform the sensex in terms of returns. It is difficult to predict the returns of purely equity funds because the market always has a natural barrier to restrict returns on these funds. However, the diversified category will definitely outperform the market going forward. I believe that the equity-diversified class will also outperform the midcap returns during the next quarter, said Dhirendra Kumar, CEO at Value Research Online.

 Take a peek at the outperformers: JM Basic is the clear front-runner in the equity diversified category with returns of 86.20 over the one-year period. It is followed by Standard Chartered Premier Equity fund and CanInfrastructure fund with 75.32 and 65.87 returns respectively. With 14.93, ICICI Prudential Discovery Inst I has posted the lowest return in the category during the period.

 J M Basic fund, which was launched in 2005 and has fetched a return of 57.81 per cent since inception, allocates about 31.15 per cent of its assets in construction, about 20.24 per cent in metals and metal products, 14.30 per cent in engineering and about 5.76 per cent in services stocks. On the other hand, Standard Chartered Premeir Equity has been investing 26.48 per cent of its assets in services, with construction stocks constituting just 5.67 per cent of the total allocation.

 Meanwhile, banking sector funds are leading the rally, registering an average return of 60.68 over the last year. This is followed by the technology funds with an average return at 24.86 per cent and FMCG at 11.68 per cent.

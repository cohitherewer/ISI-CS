 Hutch to take stake sale call on Feb 15

 Selloff mode

 Hong Kong, Jan. 30 (PTI): Hutchison Telecom International Ltd (HTIL) is believed to have called a meeting of shareholders on February 15 to seek their approval for the proposed sale of its 67 per cent stake in Hutch Essar.

 The meeting could be called either under an annual general meeting or as an extraordinary general meeting as decided by HTIL, sources said. HTIL will have to file the outcome of the meeting with the regulatory authorities.

 Hutchison Whampoa holds a majority stake in HTIL, Egyptian mobile operator Orascom 19 per cent and public and some other foreign institutional investors have some stake. Hence, the shareholders approval should not be a difficult task.

 HTIL will have to explain the rationale of exiting its most profitable market to the shareholders. An HTIL spokesperson declined to comment, saying, We do not discuss shareholders matter.

 Once the shareholders give the go-ahead, the HTIL board can look at the offers which could be in the form of formal bids.

 British mobile firm Vodafone has said it would submit a formal offer in the second week of February. The other interested parties are HTILS 33 per cent Indian partner Essar group and the Hinduja group.

 These three companies have offered preliminary bids so far, while another suitor, Reliance Communications, is understood to have completed due diligence.

 HTILS board has taken stock of the current position yesterday for selling its 67 per cent stake in Hutch Essar. 

 If things move at the normal pace, HTIL could look at the formal bids of the three players who already have completed due diligence and their final bid will be in sync with the due diligence taken by them.

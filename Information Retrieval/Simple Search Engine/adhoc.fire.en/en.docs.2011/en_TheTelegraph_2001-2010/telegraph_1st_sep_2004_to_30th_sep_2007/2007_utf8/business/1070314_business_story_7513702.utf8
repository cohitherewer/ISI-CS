 Dr Reddys pulls out of Merck race

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Pill deal

 Mumbai, March 13: After Tata Steels successful acquisition of Corus Group Plc, India Inc will soon be represented in another global takeover battle. Ranbaxy Laboratories and Cipla are now eyeing the generic drug business of German giant Merck. However, Dr Reddys Laboratories, another contender, has pulled out of the race to acquire the unit, which is valued by analysts to be between $5 billion and $6 billion.

 While Ranbaxy and Cipla will be competing against the might of heavyweights that may include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Actavis and Novartis AG, DRL has opted out of the race citing high value of the transaction.

 Ranbaxy Laboratories submitted a bid for the generic drugs arm of Merck on Monday while Cipla is joining hands with private equity firms. The size of Ranbaxys bid could not be ascertained as officials declined to comment on the issue.

 Confirming that the company has not put in a bid for Merck Generics, sources close to the Hyderabad-based DRL said the transaction size was too large and the timing was not right.

 In January, Germanys Merck had said that it was planning to sell the generic drugs business to pay for its acquisition of Serono, the Swiss biotechnology group. The sale would allow Merck to concentrate on its core prescription business. Merck Generics has sales network in more than 90 countries and is the third-largest generic company in the world. In 2005 it reported sales of 1.8 billion euros and operating profit of 238 million euros. It has around 5,000 employees.

 Ranbaxy Laboratories too announced in January that it might put in a bid for the generics business. If Ranbaxy is indeed successful in clinching the deal, it will become the third largest generic pharma company in the world. 

 For Ranbaxy, which derives sizeable revenues from international operations, overseas acquisition is not new. Last year, the company acquired 96.7 per cent of Terapia from Advent International for $324 million. Terapia is the largest independent generic company in Romania.

 Confirming that it has submitted a bid for Merck Generics, Ranabaxy CEO Malvinder Singh said, We are looking to evaluate the asset and are going to be very practical about it.

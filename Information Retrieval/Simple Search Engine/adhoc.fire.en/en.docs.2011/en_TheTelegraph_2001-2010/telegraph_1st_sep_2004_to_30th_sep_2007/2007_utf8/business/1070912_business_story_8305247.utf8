The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Survey holds out hope for job seekers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 11: Finding a job may become much easier now. Almost 49 per cent of the companies surveyed in India are eager to employ more people. 

 India is leading the employment growth in Asia Pacific, followed by Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong, the fourth-quarter hiring outlook survey by US-based consultant Manpower said.

 Of the 27 countries surveyed, only Peru and Singapore are ahead of India in their employment outlook. 

 This is the strongest outlook reported in India ever since the survey commenced in 2005. The outlook represents an 8 percentage points increase quarter over quarter and a 5 percentage points increase year on year, said Soumen Basu, executive chairman, Manpower India.

 The optimism of Indian employers reflects the pace at which business throughout India is growing, Basu said.

 Out of the 4,922 employers surveyed in India, 49 per cent expected an increase in hiring activity in the fourth quarter, 2 per cent anticipated a decrease, while 41 per cent saw no change in hiring plans in the recent future.

 The survey included employers across seven sectors finance, real estate, manufacturing, public administration, services, transportation and retail trade. Of the seven, only employers in manufacturing reported a decline in hiring.

 According to the survey, conducted for the 10th consecutive quarter, employers across the seven sectors in India reported positive hiring intentions. The greatest improvement was reported in transportation where the outlook improved by 17 per cent. Employers in all the other sectors reported relatively stable hiring plans.

 Motivated by a robust GDP growth, companies are taking up development activities in new-age industries such as retail, telecom and information technology and require huge human resources to meet their expansion plans.

 The increased hiring in services is a reflection of its role in Indias GDP growth. Also, the capital and financial health of the country today is fuelling the demand in finance, real estate and retail, which assures a plethora of opportunities for job seekers in the next three months, Basu said.

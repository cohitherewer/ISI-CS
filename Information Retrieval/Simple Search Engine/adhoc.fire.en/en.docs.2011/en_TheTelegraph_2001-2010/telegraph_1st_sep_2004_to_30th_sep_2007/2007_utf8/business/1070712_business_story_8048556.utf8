 Dabur taste for food merger

 New Delhi, July 11 (PTI): Dabur India today said it would merge its wholly owned subsidiary, Dabur Foods Limited, with itself.

 The board of directors of Dabur Foods has approved the merger with retrospective effect from April 1, a company statement said. 

 We believe this merger is a unique opportunity to combine the strengths of a foods company with those of a growing and profitable FMCG business to create a strong and growing global competitor in the health and wellness space, Dabur India CEO Sunil Duggal said.

 He said Dabur Foods was an intrinsic part of Daburs growth strategy and had been one of the fastest growing businesses, reporting a 35 per cent CAGR for the past five years.

 With Dabur Foods now deciding to expand its presence in health and wellness, a merger with the parent company is the logical step forward, company CEO Amit Burman said.

 Duggal said through the merger, the company would be able to invest and expand more effectively because of the combined scale, profitability and global reach. Dabur India owns 100 per cent of the outstanding shares of Dabur Foods. So, no new shares will be issued after the merger.

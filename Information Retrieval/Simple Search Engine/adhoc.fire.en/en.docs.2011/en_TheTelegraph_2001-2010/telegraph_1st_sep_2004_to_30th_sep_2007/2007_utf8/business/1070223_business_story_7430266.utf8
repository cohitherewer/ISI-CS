 Breather for Karvy

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, Feb. 22: In a major relief to Karvy Computershares, the Securities and Exchange Board of India today allowed the company to undertake fresh business in the capital market.

 The market regulator had barred Karvy from acting as a share transfer agent and an issue registrar following its alleged involvement in the IPO scam last year. The interim order was issued in last April.

 Sebi, however, made it clear that lifting of the ban was an interim measure pending final disposal of the case by its enquiry officer.

 The order said Karvy Computershares, in its capacity as a registrar to an issue, had allegedly facilitated key operators and financiers in cornering shares in IPOs. 

 Further, it did not maintain the distance with other Karvy group companies and failed to weed out multiple and fictitious applications in the IPOs and facilitated key operators by issuing single refund orders.

 Sebi made it clear that todays order would, however, not come in the way of the proceedings against Karvy Computershares, which is part of the Karvy group of companies.

 Both Karvy Stock Broking Private Limited and Karvy Computershares have filed appeals challenging Sebis interim order on the IPO scam before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT). While the appeal by the former has been dismissed in January this year, the appeal of Karvy Compoutershares is still pending before SAT. 

 Atlanta shares

 Sebi today banned 16 entities from trading in the shares of Atlanta Ltd. The banned entities include even the promoters of Atlanta, a Sebi order said.

 Atlanta Ltd came out with an initial public offer of 43 lakh shares in September last year and the shares were listed on the Bombay and National stock exchanges.

 The scrip had opened at Rs 170, a premium of 13.33 per cent over its offer price of Rs 150. However, the share price jumped by a whopping 681 per cent in 55 trading days.

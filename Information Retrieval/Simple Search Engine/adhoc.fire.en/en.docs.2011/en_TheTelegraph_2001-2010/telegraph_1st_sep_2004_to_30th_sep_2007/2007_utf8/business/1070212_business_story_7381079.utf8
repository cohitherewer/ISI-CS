 Back to the bank

 Bank deposits are scoring over small savings, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay 

Move over post office small savings schemes. Bank fixed deposits are now giving a higher return, thanks to the interest rate hikes in recent times.

 Since the beginning of the current financial year, banks had been raising their deposit rates so that they had enough money to lend. A tight liquidity condition in the market and fierce competition to mobilise resources have seen bank fixed deposit rates rise above 8 per cent the highest interest rate in post office small savings schemes. 

 With the removal of the 10 per cent bonus on the post office monthly income scheme (POMIS) from February 2006, the scheme has also become less attractive. 

 On a high 

 In the latest round of rate hikes, banks are now offering as high as 9 per cent interest rate on fixed deposits on certain maturities for general category depositors and 9.25 per cent to 9.5 per cent for senior citizens a higher rate than that offered by the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme. The real rate of interest after factoring in the current inflation of 6 per cent is 2 per cent for post office savings schemes and 3 per cent for bank fixed deposits. 

 Limited offer

 However, the higher rates on bank fixed deposits are for limited periods and there is usually a minimum deposit stipulation attached to them. Besides, this rate is offered on deposits of certain maturity or timeframe. For others, the rate of interest is lower.

 For example, the State Bank of Indias Platinum Account, which offers a 9 per cent interest rate for general category depositors, is available till March 31. Similarly, Punjab National Bank is offering a 9 per cent fixed deposit scheme till April 31. Though other banks havent mentioned any dates, they maintain that their offers are for a limited period. So, if you miss the bus now, you may not be able to catch it again anytime soon.

 Short-term gain

 The 9 per cent rate of interest is being offered on fixed deposits of two and three years. For deposits with higher maturity, the rate is lower and varies between 7.75 and 8.25 per cent. One would have to take a short-term view while going in for the 9 per cent fixed deposit schemes. The banks may not renew your deposit at the same rate on maturity. 

 Minimum amount

 Besides, you will not get a 9 per cent rate of interest with any amount of deposit. The minimum deposit for SBI Platinum Account and PNB Mahabachat Term Deposit schemes are Rs 1 lakh, while it is Rs 10,000 for ICICI Bank and IDBI. 

 Tax saving deposits

 On the tax savings front too, bank deposits win hands down. ICICI Bank is offering a 9.5 per cent interest rate on its tax saving fixed deposits for five years and Kotak Mahindra Bank is offering 9 per cent. 

 The rate is higher for senior citizens and far superior than the 8 per cent offered in NSC. Besides, the bank tax saving fixed deposits are locked in for five years, while it is six years in case of NSC. 

 Moreover, in bank deposits, the interest is compounded quarterly against half-yearly in NSC. 

 Penalty point

 So, thinking of shifting your post office deposits to banks? You cannot withdraw your post office MIS unless it is more than a year old. Premature withdrawal between two and three years entails a penalty of 2 per cent. The penalty is 1 per cent if the withdrawal is made after three years.

 Winning strategy

 If you withdraw your POMIS opened a year ago, you will have to pay 2 per cent on the principal while you have earned an interest rate of 8 per cent. That is, your net interest income is 6 per cent. By parking the money in a bank fixed deposit, you will be earning 9 per cent a per cent more than what you would have got at the post office. This strategy works to your benefit. Senior citizens will earn a higher 9.25 per cent to 9.5 per cent interest on their deposits in banks. 

 TDS worry

 Banks will deduct tax at the rate of 10.2 per cent on interest income above Rs 5,000 in a financial year. This tax is deducted at the branch level. If your aggregate interest income is above Rs 5,000 in a financial year in a particular branch, your deposit will be liable for tax deduction at source. So, if you park your funds in different banks, you can avoid the TDS.

 Interest income from post office schemes is also liable to TDS, but post offices dont deduct it at source. The liability is yours to pay the tax to the government. If you dont pay, it becomes black money.

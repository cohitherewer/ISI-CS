 Beat the rate riddle

 Risk perceptions should govern interest rate choices for home loans, says Seetha

 George Ninan is kicking himself for delaying his house buying plans. He had seriously considered it in 2003 when interest rates on housing loans were hovering in the 7 to 8 per cent range, but put it off. But with interest rates now in the 9 to 10 per cent range, hes not sure if buying a house is the right thing to do. 

 Over the past year, interest rates on housing loans have been rising steadily. Apprehending that the huge take off in home loans which grew 50 per cent a year was being fuelled by speculation and could lead to the market crashing, the Reserve Bank of India took several steps that increased the cost of money, which got reflected in higher interest rates. 

 Double-digit blow

 Home loans may not be in the 14 to 15 per cent range they were in 2000, but definitely moving into the double-digit bracket again. The trend doesnt seem likely to reverse in the near future, though the final word will come when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reviews its monetary policy on January 31. 

 So have home loans become too expensive and would it be better to wait till rates fall again? 

 Property push

 Dont just blame rising interest rates for what Harsh Roongta, CEO of apnaloans.com, calls an affordability crisis. Its the skyrocketing property values that are primarily to blame, he says, with costlier loans adding to the problem. 

 But its not clear if that could lead to a lull in the market, sparking off a correction in prices. Demand has slipped; transactions are clearly at the lower end, insists Roongta. 

 Banks arent quite willing to concede the point. The prevailing interest rates have come back to the levels they ranged at four years back, says Rajiv Sabharwal, head of retail assets at ICICI Bank. Even then, he says, the market was growing at 30 per cent. If growth has come down to 25 per cent now, it is mainly because of galloping property prices rather than interest rates. In any case, he says, demand for housing isnt likely to drop too much because the market is primarily driven by genuine, individual demand. 

 Investment idea

 This is not a good time for those who are buying property as an investment, says Sandeep Shanbhag, director of Wonderland Investments. For genuine home buyers, there is never a good time or a bad time, he argues. Getting a good deal on a loan is the best, if not the only option for them. 

 Old question

 The key question, then, is the old one about whether one should go in for a floating interest rate (where interest rates rise and fall) or a fixed interest rate (where you may be insulated against rate hikes, but could lose out if rates fall). 

 With interest rates set to rise only further, it would be tempting to opt for a fixed rate. But, says Roongta, it might still be better to go in for floating rates, since they tend to be lower than fixed rates by at least 1.5 percentage points. Only the extremely risk averse should opt for a fixed rate, he advises. There is no point paying a premium unless it is a genuinely fixed rate. 

 Semi-fixed

 What he is referring to is a semi-fixed rate or a clause in most loan agreements giving the bank the freedom to change the rate depending on market conditions. Journalist Arijit Bhattacharya bargained with his bank and got the clause removed when he took a loan to buy a flat in June 2005 at a fixed 8.25 per cent interest, which is why he continues to pay the same rate, though his bank now charges 10.25 per cent. Some banks offer fixed and semi-fixed as a choice, says Shanbagh, but not everybody is so transparent and the semi-fixed nature is hidden in the fine print. Depending on the circumstances, the semi-fixed rate is usually reviewed once in two or three years. This, says Shanbhag, is an option, considering it is 100 to 150 basis points cheaper than a real fixed rate. 

 Floating balloon

 Floating rates have their own risks, though. Rues Prakash Natarajan, an independent real estate and housing loan expert, It is like a balloon; it only floats upwards. Not everybody is as lucky as Manish Kumar, whose bank did bring down rates when they fell, informing him through regular statements. Kumar had opted for a floating rate of 9.75 per cent in 2002 and now, even after the increases over the past six months, is paying 9.25 per cent interest. 

 Customers need to check if the bank they are negotiating with did reduce its rates between 2001 and 2003 when interest rates were on a declining trend, advises Roongta. Customers also need to be alert to interest rate movements after the loan has been taken, says Natarajan. 

 Take a mix

 What Natarajan suggests is a mix of fixed and floating rates fixed for a certain number of years and then floating. Thats what corporate executive Krishnakoli Datta did, taking a fixed rate for two years and a floating rate after that. We knew that over a 15-year horizon, interest rates would see ups and downs. She and her husband thought it better to have a smaller outgo initially and a larger one later when their incomes also rise. 

 Renegotiate

 Those who have already taken a loan cant do much except, says Shanbhag, insure against a further rise in rates by renegotiating the kind of rate, though he admits that its easier said than done. Banks do agree to a switch from floating to fixed and vice versa for a fee but, says Natarajan, the benefit of a lower rate may be substantial enough to nullify the impact of this.

 Pre-pay

 If someone has enough money, then it may also be a good idea to pre-pay part of the loan today to reduce the overall liability in future in a rising interest rate scenario. Roongta feels this is a good option, but Shanbhag advises putting the money into a more rewarding investment. 

 Clearly, there are enough ways to beat the affordability crisis.

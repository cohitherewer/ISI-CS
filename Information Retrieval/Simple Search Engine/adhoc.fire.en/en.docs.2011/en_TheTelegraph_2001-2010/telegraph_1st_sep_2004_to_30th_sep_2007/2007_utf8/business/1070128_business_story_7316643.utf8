 Our business grew on the back of a 41.2 per cent increase in credit and a 22.6 per cent rise in deposits, said P.K. Gupta, chairman and managing director of UBI. 

 The banks deposits for the nine months grew to Rs 33,503 crore from Rs 27,324 crore in the year-ago period. Advances rose to Rs 20,687 crore from Rs 14,651 crore over the 12-month period.

 Buoyed by the performance, the bank aims to clock a total business of Rs 60,000 crore to close the fiscal and Rs 1,00,000 crore by March 2009.

 During the last 18 months, we have been able to create 13.5 lakh savings account and 52,500 current deposit accounts, said Gupta, adding that it has helped increase the share of low-cost deposits to total deposits.

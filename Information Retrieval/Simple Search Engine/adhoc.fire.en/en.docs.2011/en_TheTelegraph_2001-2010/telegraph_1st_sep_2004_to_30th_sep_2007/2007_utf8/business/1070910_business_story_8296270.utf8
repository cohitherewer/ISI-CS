 Calcutta, Sept. 9: India exports more auto components to DaimlerChrysler than all the other Southeast Asian countries taken together.

 Wilfred Aulbur, managing director of DaimlerChrysler India, said the country had the potential to become a global auto component sourcing hub.

 India can become a leader in auto component sourcing in terms of cost and technical advantage. Our business in the country has grown 20 per cent over the past two to three years, he said.

 India has a 0.4 per cent share in the $185-billion international auto component business. Around $15 billion worth of auto components were sold in 2006-07, of which $2.8 billion came from exports. The sales would swell to $40 billion by 2016, of which $20 billion would be from exports. The auto component industry is expected to be valued at $1.9 trillion by 2015. Low-cost countries, such as India, should have a 40 per cent share in the market. 

 Around 50 companies, including Bharat Forge, supply parts to DaimlerChrysler India.

 There are hundreds of vendors in India. But it will take some time to bring them up to the international standards, said Aulbur.

 Commercial vehicles

 Daimler will start manufacturing a few hundred units of its truck, the Actros, by the end of the year. The truck is popular among mining companies. 

 The auto major is also planning to launch other long-haul trucks, such as the Axor and the Unimog, in the country. 

 Aulbur said for medium and large cars the excise duty was 24 per cent, while for other vehicles it was 16 per cent.

 There should be a uniformity in the scale of duty to push growth in the high-end segment, he added.

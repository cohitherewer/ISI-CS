 Bajaj Auto stock hammered on bourses

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 18: The Bajaj Auto scrip slid 8.54 per cent, or Rs 213.50, to close at Rs 2,286.80 on the BSE today.

 Investors pummelled the scrip for the second day running over apprehensions about the terms of its insurance ventures with Allianz. Yesterday, the scrip fell 6.71 per cent on the BSE. 

 The investors have reservations about the terms of demerger of the company which was announced yesterday.

 They feel the deal will not benefit the two entities that will run the businesses of Bajaj Auto after the demerger since they will have less cash on their books. Of the two entities, Bajaj Auto is one and Bajaj Finserv the other. The third outfit to emerge from the exercise is Bajaj Holdings amp; Investment which will hold shares in the demerged entities in addition to the groups investment in ICICI Bank.

 The investors are worried about the call and put options in Bajaj Autos insurance ventures with Allianz. They fear the terms may force Bajaj Auto to sell its stake in the ventures at a nominal price.

 The company has said that these options will permit Allianz to increase its holding to 50 per cent from 26 per cent in the general insurance venture; and to 74 per cent from 26 per cent in the life insurance company. This may occur if the government approves such a stake hike. These options led to some brokerages downgrading the Bajaj Auto stock today. 

 Macquaire Research said the company has revealed a nasty surprise vis--vis the terms of its insurance ventures. The Street has been assigning high valuations to the insurance subsidiaries, but the new disclosures may mean that the stock market has to revise its target prices downwards.

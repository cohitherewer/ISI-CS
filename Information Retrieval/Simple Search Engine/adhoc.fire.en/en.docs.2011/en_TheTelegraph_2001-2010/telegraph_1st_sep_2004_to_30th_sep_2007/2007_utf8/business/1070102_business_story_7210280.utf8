 Bhel to invest Rs 3200 cr

 New Delhi, Jan. 1 (PTI): Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (Bhel) today announced an investment of Rs 3,200 crore during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan to expand its equipment manufacturing capacity to 15,000 mw annually.

 We have just completed our first phase of expansion to increase the capacity to supply equipment for 10,000 mw capacity at an investment of Rs 1,200 crore... But this is not the end of it, we are developing a plan to expand further, Bhel chairman and managing director Ashok K. Puri said.

 In the Eleventh Plan (2007-2012), we should place this in motion, he said, while adding, We have to create capacity according to the need but not when the demand is just on paper. 

 Puris remarks come in the wake of big projects such as the proposed 12,000-mw Hirma project in Orissa failing to make any headway.

 Sarin rejects Essar claim

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 14: Vodafone CEO Arun Sarin today said the Essar group does not have a right of first refusal over Vodafones $11.1-billion deal to buy a controlling stake in Hutchison Essar.

 With respect to Vodafone, Essar does not have the right of first refusal, Sarin said. The Essar group spokesperson declined to comment.

 The nature of the right of first refusal in the agreement between Hutchison Telecom International Limited (HTIL) and the Essar group has long been disputed by the parties. 

 Hutchison has said the right would only apply if it sold its stake to certain Indian companies. The Essar group maintains that irrespective of the nationality of the bidder, Ruias have the first right to accept or refuse buying out HTILs 67 per cent stake in Hutch Essar.

 The issue of first right of refusal is no longer relevant. Essar was given an option to match the highest bidder in order to buy out HTILs stake, but with Vodafone emerging as the winner, the issue no longer exists, Analjit Singh, chairman of Max India and one of the local partners of Hutchison Essar, told The Telegraph.

 According to Sarin, Vodafone will retain Hutchison Essar managing director Asim Ghosh after it takes control of the company. Asim is a very good leader We are very happy with him, Sarin said.

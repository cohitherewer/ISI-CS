 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The government today said gas prices would be reviewed every five year. It also put fertiliser units, city gas distributors and power companies on the priority list for allocations.

 M.S. Srinivasan, petroleum secretary, said, The government is well within its rights to fix sectoral priorities keeping in mind overall national interest. 

 Oil ministry officials said the decision on a five-year review of prices was in line with global practices. Depending on sales, it (the prices) may go up or come down, the officials said. 

 Analysts said there was now the possibility of gas turning expensive for those entities who had entered into long-term deals in the hope of getting it cheap. 

 Srinivasan said the price approved by the empowered group of ministers (EGoM) would apply uniformly across all sectors. It should not matter to the producer, Reliance Industries in this case, as to who uses the gas, as a uniform price will be charged from all.

 He said allocations would be done on the basis of the integrated energy policy which is being prepared by the Planning Commission.

 Srinivasan said the priority in allocation should be given to fertiliser units, followed by city gas distributors and then power companies. 

 The government would not allow trading in gas. The policy clearly states that the gas should be sold to end users and so there is no scope for traders, Srinivasan said.

 The empowered group of ministers on Wednesday fixed the price for Reliance Industries gas from its fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin at $4.2 per million British thermal unit (mBtu), which was less than the companys asking price of $4.44 per mBtu.

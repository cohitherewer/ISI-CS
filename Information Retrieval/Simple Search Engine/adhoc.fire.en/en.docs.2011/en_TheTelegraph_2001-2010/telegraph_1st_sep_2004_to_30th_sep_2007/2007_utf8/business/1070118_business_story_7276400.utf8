 Murthy blames it on mandarins

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 17: Infosys chief mentor Narayana Murthy today blamed the bureaucracy for the countrys slow progress.

 Murthy urged the government to introduce performance-linked incentives to bring accountability among bureaucrats.

 The best way is to make a large part of the bureaucrats salary dependent on the progress of projects handled by them, said Murthy, adding that most projects get delayed because there is no link between performance and reward in our government.

 The Infosys founder also exhorted India Inc to adopt fairness, transparency and accountability in their work, which he termed as necessary to keep investors on their side.

 Investors have many choices today and given that, they can move in a jiffy. So, we have to satisfy the expectations and aspirations of the most stringent of investors and consumers, Murthy said at a seminar on ethics and values as a corporate strategy organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 Companies should be accountable for any decision they take for the sake of all stakeholders and discharge their responsibility without fear or favour, he said.

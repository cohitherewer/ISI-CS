 IBM hungry for more buyouts

 San Francisco, June 18 (Reuters): International Business Machines Corp (IBM) may acquire more software companies this year following two recent purchases as it tries to boost softwares share of its total profit to 50 per cent, analysts said.

 IBM is banking on software, which accounts for 20 per cent of revenue but generates 40 per cent of pre-tax earnings, to lift overall profitability of the company that spans computer hardware, services and software.

 Gross profit margins at the companys software unit, led by Steve Mills, are typically the highest of IBMs four main businesses and stood at 83.6 per cent in the first quarter. 

 The hardware units profit margin, on the other hand, was 34.8 per cent and global technology services came in at 29.2 per cent.

 The Armonk, New York based company is the worlds second-largest software maker after Microsoft Corporation.

 One area where the company sees opportunity is selling software to firms that repackage it with their own software. For example, IBM last week announced an expansion of a deal with network equipment maker Cisco Systems, under which Cisco will use IBM software to help customers manage their communications networks better.

 IBM said its business in that market, called OEM, or original equipment manufacturer, is growing at a double-digit annual percentage rate following acquisitions in recent years. The company has signed more than 4,500 deals with companies using IBM software in their products.

 Theres a good opportunity out there, Mills said in an interview. Were moving more and more towards the commercial off-the-shelf model. Under the model, customers buy IBM software and use it in their own applications.

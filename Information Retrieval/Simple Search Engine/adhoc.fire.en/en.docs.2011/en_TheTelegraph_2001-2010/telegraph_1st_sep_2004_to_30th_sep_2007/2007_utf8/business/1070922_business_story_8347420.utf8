 RNRL ready to turn on piped gas

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ambani: New venture

 Mumbai, Sept. 21: Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL), the Anil D. Ambani group company, is aggressively entering the city gas distribution business. It has applied for distribution licences in four cities Delhi, Mumbai, Gurgaon and Noida.

 The company filed an application today with the recently formed Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board.

 Sources close to RNRL said the company was planning to enter the piped gas distribution business in other cities as well. 

 In its annual report for the period ended March 31 this year, RNRL had said it intended to establish city gas distribution networks in Mumbai, Delhi and other regions as well. Ghaziabad and Faridabad were some of the areas that had been shortlisted by the company.

 RNRLs application to enter the city gas distribution business ignited the stock today. The scrip was the star performer on the BSE. It hit a 52-week high of Rs 79.20 during intra-day trades after opening at Rs 58. It later ended at Rs 76.70, a gain of 35.04 per cent, or Rs 19.90, over its previous close. Volumes on both the bourses were fairly large.

 Analysts said the markets, so far, did not have a clear picture of RNRLs business model, but the scenario could now be changing.

 Mahanagar Gas, which is a joint venture between GAIL and British Gas, and Delhi-based Indraprastha Gas, a joint venture between BPCL and GAIL, are the main players in the city gas distribution business. 

 Besides city gas distribution, RNRL wants to enter into gas exploration, source and supply fossil fuels, bio-diesel, uranium and hydrogen fuels.

 The company, however, did not say from where it would source the gas for its venture. Sources ruled out the possibility of the company using the gas that it is entitled to receive from the Krishna Godavari basin under the terms of an understanding with brother Mukesh Ambani.

 Only modalities of the allocation from Reliance Industries Ltd to RNRL are currently being argued, a source said.

 Panel picks holes in SEZ labour rules

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, July 4: A parliamentary panel has said the government should not dilute labour laws in special economic zones (SEZs). 

 Though section 45 of the SEZ Act prohibits such changes, the government has softened provisions while framing rules for the economic enclaves, according to the parliamentary standing committee of commerce.

 The committee feels that several loopholes exist which could virtually rob the right to demonstrate or strike in an SEZ unit.

 Rules are framed to implement an act. They are normally based on the act. Sources said at times there might be contradictions.

 The House panel is studying the merits of SEZs from the standpoint of labour welfare. It will soon present its report to Parliament.

 In its deposition before the panel, the labour ministry had said all laws that apply to industrial units in the country would also apply to SEZs. 

 It even cited a specific clause in the SEZ Act that debars the government from introducing certain flexibilities in SEZ areas that are enjoyed by the infotech and BPO units.

 The panel is not convinced by the ministrys arguments. 

 The SEZ rules delegate powers under the Industrial Disputes Act to the development commissioner of a zone. The commissioner can declare the SEZ a public utility.

 This implies that if the development commissioner is so inclined, there can be no strikes or demonstrations in SEZ areas, the sources said. In the proposed norms for states, there are exemptions relating to minimum wages and the hiring of contract labour.

 The sources said the norms allow for contracts with easy retrenchment conditions.

 They said the panel was not opposed to the flexibility in laws. It is against the duality in treatment of labour within zones and outside.

 Consequently, the panel wants the government to amend the rules and the proposed norms for states.

 This should be done to ensure their conformity with the SEZ Act and labour laws of the country.

 The panel has also proposed that the percentage of cultivable land to the total area should not be more than 20 per cent in multi-product SEZs and 40 per cent in the case of others. Instead of a minimum area for an SEZ, it also wants the government to stipulate a maximum area that can be acquired for an SEZ. 

 The report has also cautioned the government against clearing new zones, till the modification of rules.

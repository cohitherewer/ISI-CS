 Rupee casts a spell on economy

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai/New Delhi, April 26: India has joined the elite club of 12 countries with a trillion dollar economy, thanks to the continuing rally in the rupee against the dollar.

 The countrys GDP crossed trillion dollars for the first time when the rupee appreciated to below 41 yesterday, Swiss investment bank Credit Sues said in a report published today. 

 Countries like the US, Japan, Germany, China, the UK, France, Italy, Spain, Canada, Brazil and Russia have all breached the trillion-dollar mark.

 The bank put the countrys GDP at around Rs 41,00,000 crore, which is slightly more than $1 trillion at the current currency level of Rs 40.76 per dollar. 

 Market capitalisation on Indian bourses at $944 billion was also close to the trillion mark, the bank said. 

 The rupee has gained 13 per cent since it touched 47 in August 2006. Continuing its uptrend for the fifth day in a row, the rupee rose to as high as 40.72. 

 It breached the 41 level yesterday, the highest since May 1998. The GDP was $900 billion a month ago when the rupee was at 45.

 The trillion-dollar GDP show augurs well for stocks. The report said bourses of as many as eight of countries enjoyed sharp spurts after crossing the billion-dollar mark.

 The rupee today closed steady at 40.90/91 against the dollar on alternate bouts of buying and selling, despite strong capital inflows and weak dollar overseas.

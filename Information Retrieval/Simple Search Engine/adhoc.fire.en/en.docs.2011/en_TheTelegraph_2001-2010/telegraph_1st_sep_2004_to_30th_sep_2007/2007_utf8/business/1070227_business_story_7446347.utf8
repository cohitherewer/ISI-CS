 Lalu does his bit to rein in price rise

 New Delhi, Feb. 26: To douse inflation, the railway budget today cut freight rates on petrol, diesel and iron ore.

 The budget also offered discounted rates on cement, wheat and fertiliser if they are despatched in empty wagons returning back to the east and south after carrying coal and ore from these regions to the north and the west.

 Its a slap on the face of inflation ... the measures that we have announced today with regard to freight rates will help check inflation, railway minister Lalu Prasad said after presenting the budget.

 The rates for the two fuels and ammonia will be lowered by 5 per cent, from April, and iron ore by 6 per cent. Lalu Prasad also announced incremental discounts of 40 per cent on cement, wheat and fertiliser if they are despatched in empty wagons.

 The minister expressed the hope that the additional discount will attract Food Corporation of India and various fertiliser and cement companies to load in open wagons returning empty.

 Our goods trains run loaded in one direction and mostly run empty in the return direction. The percentage of empty running is worse in case of open wagons, Lalu Prasad said.

 Reining in the price spiral, which has started threatening the countrys economic growth prospects, is a key government strategy. Analysts expected the railway and the general budgets to address inflation as part of a strategy drawn up by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 

 Top officials said there will be provisions against inflation in both the budgets. While the rail budget focussed on freight rates, the general budget is likely to cut import duties on food products, fuel and goods whose prices have risen rapidly.

 The freight cuts should help as these were the very commodities whose price rise was troubling the economy, Amit Banerjee, an analyst with a state run bank, said.

 He said the cuts will help the cement and steel sectors. The impact on fuel is uncertain since most of it is transported through pipelines.

 The UPA needs to check inflation not only because it will blotch its report card but also the Uttar Pradesh elections is due in April, and it needs to deliver on prices by then.

 Lalu Prasad has left most other freight rates unchanged. It had cut the rates in November 2004 to wean away business from truckers. Railways is the nations main carrier of steel, aluminum, coal, minerals, fertiliser and foodgrain.

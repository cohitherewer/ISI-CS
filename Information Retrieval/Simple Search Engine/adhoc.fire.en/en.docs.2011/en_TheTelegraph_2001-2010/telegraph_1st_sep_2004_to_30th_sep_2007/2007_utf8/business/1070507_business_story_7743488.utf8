 ENTER THE DRAGON

 Calcutta, May 6: China-based Sinosteel Corporation is planning to set up an engineering unit in the state.

 It will partner with an Indian firm for the project, which involves an investment of Rs 100 crore. The Chinese government-owned steel company is in talks for possible tieups, and a decision is expected in a few weeks. Sinosteel India chief Hongsen Wang will come down to the city to discuss the equity structure with the Indian partner. 

 The company plans to set up a unit forged roll an equipment used in steel making with an initial capacity of 2,500 tonnes per annum. It has looked at various locations, including Haldia. The plant will cater to the rolling mills coming up in Bengal, Jharkhand and Orissa.

 Apart from Sinosteel India, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sinosteel Corporation, Sinosteel Xingtai Machinery amp; Mini Roll Co Ltd the worlds largest manufacturer of forged rolls will also be a partner in this project. The Chinese companies are keen to hold a 76 per cent stake.

 If the project comes up in Bengal, it may mark a new phase in the states relationship with China. Bengal wants to follow the Chinese model of rapid industrialisation. Sinosteel will be the first Chinese state-owned enterprise to invest in the manufacturing sector and set up shop here.

 Sinosteel is also interested in setting up a greenfield steel plant in Jharkhand. The company may sign an MoU with the Jharkhand government for the 1.5-mt plant. 

 Sinosteels decision to invest in greenfield units in India is a sign that Chinese companies are keen to participate in the countrys growing steel market, Priya Brata Sinha, Sinosteel India s general manager in Calcutta, said.

 Before Sinosteel, another Chinese state-owned company Dong Fang Electric worked in Bengal. It executed a tender for two power projects. Some Chinese automobile companies, both in the two-wheeler and four-wheeler segments, have expressed interest to enter the state. 

 Zongshen Industrial Group, a leading Chinese motorcycle company, is likely to team up with the Indonesian Salim group to set up a two-wheeler unit at Uluberia. 

 Another Chinese auto firm, Guangzhou Automobile Industry Group, plans to launch two-wheelers and four-wheelers in partnership with local company Xenitis. However, the Chinese company is yet to pick up a stake.

 Blue Foods to serve US coffee 

 KAKOLY CHATTERJEE

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: Blue Foods has acquired franchisee rights for The Coffee Bean amp; Tea Leaf, the US-based beverage chain. 

 The company will set up the first outlet in Select City Walk mall in Delhi in October. Other joints will be opened in premium locations such as the Oberoi Mall in Mumbai, GVK Mall in Hyderabad, Great India Place in Noida and the international airports in Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and Chennai.

 Sunil Kapur, managing director of Blue Foods, said, We expect to grow 12 per cent on a year-on-year basis. We are eyeing a turnover of Rs 30 lakh per month in each of the outlets. Right from the raw beans to the powder, all will be imported from the US. 

 The outlets will not be a hangout for college students. It will be more of a lifestyle place aimed at executives and yuppies, Kapur added. 

 Blue Foods will operate on a royalty basis. The company will spend around Rs 1.5-2 crore on each outlet, having a carpet area of 1,500 to 2,000 sq ft. This coffee chain will also serve snacks, sandwiches and salads as part of its breakfast menu. 

 Blue Foods plans to go solo in metros and big cities. In Tier-II cities, the company may follow the sub-franchisee model. Apart from malls, it will also set up standalone coffee shops. There are more than 390 Coffee Bean joints world over. The outlets offer a variety of freshly roasted coffee and speciality tea along with baked goodies and blended ice drinks.

 Coffee retailing is expected to grow over 30 per cent in the next two years. Organised coffee retail is estimated at more than $150 million. Coffee retail chains such as Barista, Costa Coffee, Cafe Coffee Day and Barnies are thus expanding their presence in the country.

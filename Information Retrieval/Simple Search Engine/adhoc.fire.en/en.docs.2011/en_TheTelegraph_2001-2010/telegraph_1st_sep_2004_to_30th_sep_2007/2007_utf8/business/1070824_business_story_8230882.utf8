 UK fund bets on core projects

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: The UK-based equity and venture capital firm 3i Group Plc plans to set up a $1-billion fund for investments in Indias infrastructure.

 3i will invest around $250 million and group outfit 3i Infrastructure Limited will bring in a similar amount with the rest coming from third parties. 

 Michael Queen, managing partner (infrastructure) of 3i, said, India has tremendous growth opportunities for investments in infrastructure. The group is optimally positioned to source attractive investments in the Indian infrastructure market and to deliver value to its shareholders and investors in the fund.

 He said 3i would leverage its global network and partnership with India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd to bring in funds. 

 The deal with India Infrastructure Finance was inked in April. 3i officials said it had set up 3i India Infrastructure Fund to apply the successful investment strategy of 3is global infrastructure business to the rapidly growing Indian market. 

 The fund plans to create a balanced portfolio of infrastructure investments and will be unlisted. According to official projections, investments in infrastructure need to increase to 8 per cent of the gross domestic product by 2012 from 3.5 per cent now.

 The government has forecast an investment of $320 billion in infrastructure over the next five years. 

 3i works from Mumbai with a team of 10 investment and advisory professionals. The company has invested not only in sectors such as power and ports but also in real estate, media and automotives.

 Sensex tanks on US worries

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 9: Bourses were once again hit by worries related to the US sub-prime mortgage segment as fresh reports on the exposure of French bank BNP Paribas came in. The sensex took a sharp knock today after a strong beginning. The benchmark index, which spurted 234 points in intra-day trade, ended 207.83 points lower at 15100.15.

 While the key BSE index oscillated in a 480-point range, market analysts blamed the crash to fresh reports of the US sub-prime crisis spreading to the European banking sector. This came after BNP Paribas, the biggest bank in France, froze funds worth $2.2 billion. Its unit, BNP Paribas Investment Partners, suspended subscriptions and redemptions in three funds because of the volatility in the US asset-backed securities market. It was speculated that around 30 per cent of the assets of the funds were linked to the US sub-prime market.

 The revelations of BNP Paribas led to European markets opening weak and its impact spreading to Indian shares. After opening at 15452.44 and rising to a high of 15542.40, the 30-share sensex crashed to a low of 15062.10, after which it ended at 15100.15, a loss of nearly 208 points from its previous close.

 We should be prepared for more bad news. It will not be surprising to see the markets coming under fresh pressure tomorrow, an analyst said.

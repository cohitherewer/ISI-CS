 Mumbai, May 14 (PTI): LIC Housing Finance has not ruled out the possibility of a further hike in mortgage rates since it expects demand to touch 26 million units in the next one year.

 The demand will continue to be there except in tier-I cities, where supply is more, the companys finance director and chief executive, S.K. Mitter, said while announcing the quarterly results.

 The company recorded a 115 per cent jump in its net profit for the quarter ended March 31. Net profit increased to Rs 89.14 crore from Rs 41.38 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. 

 The company recorded a net profit of Rs 279 crore for the year ended March 31 against Rs 209 crore in the previous fiscal.

 Mitter hinted at further rise in interest rates. Rates, which are cyclical in nature, have not reached its peak yet, he said. There is a strength in the market and no lull in demand, he added. He, however, said the company would maintain a 20-25 per cent growth rate year-on-year.

 During 2006-07, the company disbursed Rs 5,121 crore as loans, a rise of just five per cent. It sanctioned Rs 6,105 crore, a 19 per cent increase over the previous year. 

 During the last quarter of 2006-07, the firm disbursed Rs 1,755 crore and sanctioned Rs 2,479 crore, registering an increase of 23 per cent and 72 per cent respectively. The outstanding mortgage portfolio of the company on March 31, 2007, was Rs 17,563 crore against Rs 14,867 crore.

 The gross NPAs on March 31 was 2.58 per cent against 3.41 per cent for the same period previous year. Net NPAs were 1.26 per cent against 1.8 per cent in the year-ago period.

 We had earlier set a target of reducing net NPAs to one per cent. During the current year, it will go much below that, Mitter said, adding that the company follows a strong mechanism to ensure that NPAs do not go up.

 Mitter said the company may float a realty fund in partnership with financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies or tieups with venture capital funds. We, however, are not thinking of any foreign tieup to launch the fund because domestic partners are ready, he said.

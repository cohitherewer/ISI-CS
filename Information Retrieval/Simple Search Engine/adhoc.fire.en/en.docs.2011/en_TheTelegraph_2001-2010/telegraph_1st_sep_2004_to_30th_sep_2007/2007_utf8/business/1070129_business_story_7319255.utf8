 The midas touch

 Gold exchange traded funds from mutuals can offer safe and decent returns, argues Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 Retail investors are a worried lot these days. Knocked down by price punches (with inflation ruling around 6 per cent), they are finding, to their utter dismay, that real returns on bank deposits are shrinking fast. 

 While most banks are trying to cash in on this situation by winching up interest rates beyond 8 per cent, most of the investors are not savvy enough to encash existing deposits and park funds in new schemes with higher returns. The equity market, on the other hand, looks promising enough in the long run, but in the short- and medium-term, it remains slippery. With small savings rates showing little signs of moving up, the choice before a retail investor in search of safe and decent returns on investments seems limited.

 But wait, you need not lose heart the Securities and Exchange Board of India has resurrected the old charm of gold, traditionally considered to be a safe investment option. Thanks to Sebi, retail investors can now buy and sell gold on bourses like shares as mutual funds have been allowed to offer funds that will invest in the yellow metal.

 So, if you dont have enough money to buy a 50-gm gold bar, you can buy units of a gold exchange traded fund (ETF) either directly from a mutual fund house or from a stock exchange.

 Four mutual funds UTI Mutual Fund, Benchmark Mutual Fund, Kotak Mutual Fund and ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund have filed prospectuses for gold ETF with Sebi. UTI Mutual Fund and Benchmark Mutual Fund have already received the market regulators go-ahead. Other fund houses have also firmed up plans to come out with gold ETFs soon.

 What is a gold ETF?

 A gold ETF is an open-ended mutual fund scheme where money raised is used to buy gold instead of company stocks as in the case of an equity fund. The gold ETF is then listed on bourses and the units are traded on stock exchanges like shares of companies. Investors can also buy their units from and sell them to the fund house at the applicable net asset value (NAV).

 A gold ETF gives investors returns that closely track yield on gold prices in the domestic market. In other words, the price per unit of a gold ETF will approximately be the market price of 1 gm or 0.1 gm of gold depending on the face value of the scheme units.

 Since it is an exchange traded fund, the NAV and portfolio holding of the scheme are determined real time.

 Gold funds are more liquid than open-ended equity schemes because the units can be bought and sold on a stock exchange on a daily basis under the regular settlement provision. Investors will have to pay the brokerage, stamp duty, security transaction tax and service tax on purchase and sale of gold ETF units. 

 Buying the units from and selling them to the mutual fund house will attract entry and exit loads. 

 The gold bullion under a gold ETF scheme is kept with a custodian on behalf of investors. The custodian, which must be a Sebi-registered bank, buys and sells (to fund redemption of units) gold in physical form.

 Better option

 Let us now take stock of other investment options in gold.

 The most popular form is investment in jewellery. The problem arises when one wants to sell gold jewellery. A shopkeeper or jewellery manufacturer will buy the jewellery, but only at a heavy discount. The discount is high even if the jewellery is hallmarked (authenticated). People also buy gold from banks and other approved institutions. But the catch is banks and approved institutions, such as MMTC, wont buy gold bars or coins once sold. One will have to go to a local jewellery shop, which will then ask for a huge discount.

 Moreover, keeping gold at home involves the risk of theft. If one keeps it in the bank, it attracts a hefty monthly rent plus service tax. 

 The third option is commodity markets where one can buy and sell gold futures without taking delivery of the metal. However, gold futures contracts are available for a maximum of three months, which means an investor in futures contract will have to settle the transaction within three months, irrespective of whether one is making a profit or suffering a loss.

 Gold ETFs, on the contrary, are open-ended and traded in the cash (not in the forwards and options market) segment of a stock market. So, one can take positions for any length of time.

 With the demand for gold going up significantly over the last few years, prices of the yellow metal are expected to rule firm. 

 According to world gold market analyst www.bulliondesk.com, gold price in 2007 may touch $850 an ounce. The expectation is corroborated by the World Gold Councils figures. It is expected that the demand for the yellow metal will keep on rising following increased appetite of countries like India, China, Vietnam and other emerging markets. 

 World Gold Council chief James Burton said, Mining of gold is not expected to grow dramatically until 2010, but demand from fast growing economies like India and China will continue to climb.

 The caveat

 According to Sebi regulation, the value of gold held by mutual funds under their gold ETFs should be determined on the basis of the London Bullion Market Associations declared price quote in dollar terms and the valuation has to be done in rupee terms by a conversion factor. This means that gold ETFs are exposed more to exchange rate risks. The price of gold is also subject to more external risks, such as crude oil price, global demand and supply. 

 Under its gold ETF guidelines, Sebi has fixed the maximum entry and exit load at 7 per cent. Taking a cue from this, fund houses have started proposing an entry load as high as 4 per cent and an exit load at 3 per cent. It means buying and selling units to respective fund houses after the new fund offer period could be a costly affair.

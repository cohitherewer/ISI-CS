 Price worries stifle stocks 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 13: Third trading session in a row, stocks ended in the negative territory today after being extremely volatile during the most part of the day. Inflation worries, fears of tougher monetary policies and profit booking were the major culprits.

 The losing trend is expected to continue tomorrow as an after-effect of todays 50-basis-point CRR hike. Brokers fear the benchmark index could even sink below the 14000-mark tomorrow and that banking shares could suffer the most. 

 Tuesday was a choppy day on the bourses, with the sensex swinging by more than 400 points to close almost a 100 points down at 14090.98. The index opened low and stocks initially witnessed selling pressure. 

 A further fall was averted as index heavyweights like Reliance Industries and ONGC saw a surge in values. But fears that the Reserve Bank may further tighten monetary measures erased most of the gains later in the session. 

 RBI deputy governor Rakesh Mohan said the central bank was worried about Indias inflation and would use all monetary policy tools to cool it down. 

 Mohans comment, coupled with profit-booking, saw most of the gains being erased. Brokers added that investors were also sold in the derivatives segment. 

 In early trade, the index saw a sharp fall of more than 177 points. It recovered from these levels, but again lost more than 230 points and breached the 14000-mark to touch 13957.50. 

 However, the index regained ground from these levels and it closed lower by 99.72 points at 14090.98, a two-week closing low. In the past three straight sessions, the sensex has crashed by 561.11 points.

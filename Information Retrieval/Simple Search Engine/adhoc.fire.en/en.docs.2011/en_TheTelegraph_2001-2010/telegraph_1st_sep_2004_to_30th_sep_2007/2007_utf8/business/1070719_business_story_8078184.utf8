 Mazumdar-Shaw: Healthy signs

 Mumbai, July 18: Biocon will sell its enzyme business to Novozymes, a Denmark-based biotechnology firm, for close to $115 million or Rs 467 crore. The sale is part of Biocons plans to concentrate on its core bio-pharmaceutical business. The deal is likely to be completed by October. 

 Biocon chief Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said: Over the past decade, we have clearly recognised the high growth trajectory of our bio-pharma business verticals and have progressively invested to build proprietary knowhow and global scale. We believe this is the right time to divest our enzymes business and focus on unleashing the full potential of our bio-pharma businesses. 

 Novozymes would make an upfront payment of $97 million to Biocon and $5 million after meeting certain business targets. In addition, $13 million will be paid in service fees and lease payments over a period of up to 10 years. 

 Novozymes manufactures enzymes, micro-organisms, pharmaceutical proteins and biopolymers. 

 The company sells about 600 products that are used in the production of textile items and food. 

 The company operates in India through its subsidiary, Novozymes South Asia Pvt Ltd, and is setting up research and development facilities in Bangalore.

 SBI to triple ATM network

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 4: The State Bank of India plans to expand its ATM network by more than three times to 25,000 over the next three years. We plan to increase our ATMs to 25,000 from 7,200 in three years. In one year, we can open 2,000-3,000 ATMs, chairman . P. Bhatt said. Of the 25,000 ATMs, a significant number would be owned by the bank while the others could be leased. 

 The SBI today joined hands with Visa to introduce SBI Gold International debit card. 

 We will make cashless banking happen in India. We have 27 million debit cards, the largest in the Asia-Pacific region and they are growing at the rate of six lakh cards a month. This will increase to a million cards, Bhatt added. 

 The bank expects to add one lakh gold card customers in the next three to six months. It is planning to introduce other variants such as platinum and shopping cards. 

 The debit card will help customers carry out card-to-card money transfer, safe online purchase or pay utility bills, said James Murray, Visas executive vice-president and general manager, Southeast Asia. The gold debit card will be available to all savings account holders of the bank with an average quarterly balance of Rs 50,000.

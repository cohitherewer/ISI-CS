 Khaitan: Looking ahead

 Calcutta, June 4: McLeod Russel India Limited plans to retire debts worth Rs 80-100 crore this fiscal. The company wants to become debt-free by 2009. Debts at the end of last fiscal were Rs 403 crore.

 Our debt-equity ratio has improved to 0.70 compared with 1.31, and we intend to bring it down to 0.50, said Aditya Khaitan, managing director, McLeod Russel India.

 The company has posted a turnover of Rs 606.61 crore for the year ended March 31, 2007, compared with Rs 511.52 crore for 2005-06. 

 Profit after tax increased to Rs 47.47 crore from Rs 22.92 crore in the previous year. On a consolidated basis, the profit after tax rose to Rs 79.57 crore from Rs 22.13 crore a year ago.

 The price of tea was up by Rs 7 per kg during the fiscal, and if the consumption trend remained the same, it should increase by 10 to 15 per cent over the next three years.

 McLeod will become a 75-million-kg company after its integration with the recently acquired Moran Tea. We will follow the same route for Moran as we did with Williamson Tea and Doom Dooma, Khaitan said.

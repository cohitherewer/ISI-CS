 Calcutta, Feb. 7: The Bangalore-based MindTree Consulting Ltd has proposed to set aside Rs 45 crore for acquisitions. The company will come out with a Rs 237.5-crore initial public offering on February 9.

 On January 10, the company signed a non-binding takeover term sheet (read, agreement) with an integrated circuit (IC) design company in an all-cash deal. MindTree Consulting officials, however, declined to give details about the name of the target company, its location and manpower. 

 We are planning a buyout in the range of $8 million to $10 million, said Kalyan K. Banerjee, senior vice-president and head of the companys research and development services. 

 The acquisition of the company will not only scale up our IC design capability, but also help us get new customers through it. The target company has presence in the US and also has a delivery centre here, he added.

 MindTree is also focusing on the emerging opportunities for the IT applications and research services business in South and West Asia following a gradual shift in the global manufacturing base to these countries. 

 The Asia-Pacific region contributes 15 per cent of our total revenue, said Raja Sanmugam, vice-president and head of APAC region, MindTree Consulting Ltd. The travel and transport sectors in this region are also poised for rapid growth, he added.

 Right now, we are catering primarily to investment banks, said N.S. Parthasarathy, executive vice-president and global delivery head, MindTree Consulting Ltd.

 Q amp;A

 Passbook poser

 The RBI has asked all banks to issue passbooks to their individual savings bank account holders. However, the HDFC Bank branch at Garia has refused to issue me a passbook for the savings bank account I hold with the branch. I had requested the manager in writing several times to issue me a passbook, but he has refused. What should I do now?

 S.S. Garg, Garia

 You have to approach the banking ombudsman. You write a letter to the bank branch stating your complaints. Wait for a month for a reply. If you dont get a reply or the banks response to your problem is not satisfactory, you can approach the banking ombudsman who sits at the regional office of the Reserve Bank of India. You can also access your regional banking ombudsman through the RBI website. 

 Loan from dad

 My father wants to give me some money as gift to purchase a flat. I am a salaried person. Will that gift amount be added to my gross total income for tax purposes? If my father gives me an interest-free loan, can I claim tax deduction on repayment of the principal?

 Mansoor Alam, Calcutta

 Gift to a lineal relation is not taxed. However, any income arising out of that gift will be taxed in the recipients hand. An interest-free loan or a gift is same in the eyes of tax law.

 Joint holding

 Should I include the interest income from bank fixed deposits held in joint names with my wife while calculating my annual income for tax purposes? I am a pensioner and my wife doesnt have an income.

 P.K. Chakraborty, Calcutta

 Yes, you have to take into account the interest income.

 No return

 I am 74 years old and own a two-storied building. I havent let out any part of my house. I have income from pension and interest on bank deposits. But my total income is less than the basic exemption limit. I also hold a PAN. Do I have to file income tax return?

 Nitya Ranjan Basu, Patuli

 Filing income tax return is voluntary for people having 

 income below the basic exemption limit.

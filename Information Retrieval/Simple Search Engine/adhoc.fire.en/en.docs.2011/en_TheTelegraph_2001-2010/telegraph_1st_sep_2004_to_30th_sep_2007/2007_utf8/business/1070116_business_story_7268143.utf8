 Cooking fuel prop to stay

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Deora: Firm stand

 New Delhi, Jan. 15: The subsidy on domestic cooking gas and kerosene supplied to the public distribution system will be extended beyond the March 31, 2007 deadline, petroleum and natural gas minister Murli Deora said today.

 Congress president Sonia Gandhi has given us a clear-cut order that the prices of fuels used by the poor should not be increased, Deora said.

 The policy on deregulating oil prices announced in 2002 aimed at phasing out subsidies on LPG and kerosene in three years. This was not implemented due to political reasons. 

 In 2005, the deadline on subsidies was extended to March 31, 2007.

 The national oil companies have been clamouring for a hike in LPG and kerosene prices on the ground that under-recoveries on the sale of these two domestic fuels were putting a severe strain on their balance sheets.

 While the government has allowed oil companies to raise diesel and petrol prices from time to time, it has been very cautious over LPG and kerosene which have been left untouched. The government fears a political backlash if the prices of these two cooking fuels are increased.

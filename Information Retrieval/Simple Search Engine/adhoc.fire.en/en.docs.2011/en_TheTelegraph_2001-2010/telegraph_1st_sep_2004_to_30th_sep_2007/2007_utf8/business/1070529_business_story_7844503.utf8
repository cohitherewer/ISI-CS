 IOC manages to overcome loss

 New Delhi, May 28: Indian Oil Corporation has clocked a 52.6 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 7,499 crore for the year ended March 31, 2007, against Rs 4,915 crore a year ago.

 A one-time sale of 20 per cent equity in ONGC helped the company rake in Rs 3,225 crore to pad up a bottomline eroded by huge under-recoveries on the sale of LPG, kerosene, petrol an diesel. 

 The oil company was bleeding because of the subsidised sales of petroleum products till the government pumped in compensatory oil bonds worth Rs 13,943 crore and saved it from plunging into the red.

 IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria declared a final dividend of 130 per cent which will involve a payout of Rs 1,550 crore for 2006-07. The earnings per share of the company were Rs 62.90 compared with Rs 42.08 in the previous year. 

 Behuria said the company is suffering a loss of Rs 2,500 crore every month during the first quarter of the current fiscal as international prices of crude have skyrocketed and retail prices have been put on hold. IOC is losing Rs 6.13 per litre on the sale of petrol and Rs 3.76 per litre on diesel. The loss on kerosene supplied to the public distribution system has gone up to Rs 14.67 per litre and that on LPG to Rs 167.14 per cylinder, he said. 

 He said although refinery margins are higher at $7 to $8 per barrel during the current fiscal compared with $4.2 per barrel in the previous year, IOCs under-recoveries would continue to be higher as it cannot get market prices for its products. However, stand-alone refineries like the Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd will gain. 

 Behuria said IOC has earmarked Rs 5,500 crore as capital expenditure during the current fiscal. A part of this will be used in the modernisation and expansion of the Haldia refinery to 7.5 million tonnes from 6 million tonnes . 

 IOC expects to get an adjoining 82-acre plot from the Calcutta port trust, currently with the sick Hindustan Fertilisers Corporation Ltd.

 The government has already approved the transfer. The port trust is expected to meet this week to finally clear the deal, a senior official said. 

 Behuria said the capital expenditure of the company could go up if there was any overseas acquisition in the upstream sector along with Oil India. The duo were on the constant lookout for oil and gas fields but have no deal lined up for the moment, he said.

 The debt:equity ratio of IOC has come down to 0.78 :1 in 2006-07 from 0.9:1 in 2005-06 and this has improved the companys borrowing capacity. It will also help to get loans at a cheaper rate, he added.

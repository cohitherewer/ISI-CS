 Thachil: Expanding hoizon

 Calcutta, May 9: Mother Dairy, a subsidiary of the National Dairy Development Board, is planning to export fruits under the Safal brand.

 The dairy products company exports only grapes under the Safal brand to Europe now. 

 The company exports processed fruits but not under its brand name. It started exporting dairy products since last year.

 The companys revenue from exports is around Rs 100 crore. We export mango pulp as well as guava, papaya, banana and pomegranate to the US and Japan. Vegetables are also exported to West Asia, said Paul Thachil, chief executive officer of Mother Dairy.

 The company has arrangements with farmers in Maharashtra who supply grapes for export.

 It is not an exclusive arrangement but we invest a lot in technical know-how as the European markets are very particular and there are a lot of certifications involved for which we work with cooperatives and individuals, Thachil added.

 Around 300 to 400 tonnes of grapes were exported last year and this year the amount is expected to increase to 40,000 tonnes. The company is expecting a turnover of Rs 2,800 crore compared with Rs 2,200 crore last year.

 Dhara, the vegetable oil and food brand, contributes around Rs 370 crore to the revenue figure. Safal, the fresh and frozen fruits, vegetables and juices brand add another Rs 300 crore.

 Mother Dairy sells fresh fruits and vegetables only in Delhi under the Safal brand, while the frozen variety is available throughout the country. 

 It also supplies fresh fruits and vegetables to a chain in Delhi. It now plans to supply to more retail chains.

 Mother Dairy has also tied up with a dairy products company near Calcutta. 

 The firm will make ice creams for Mother Dairy for distribution in the east.

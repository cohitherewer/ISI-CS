 Sensex not amused

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 11: The stock market waited for cues from Infosys and then voted with its feet sending the sensex below 15000 after two days atop that peak.

 The sensex plunged almost 180 points to a low of 14829.55 after the software services giant trimmed its earnings forecast for the full year ended March 31 next year but then bounced back at the close to 14910.62 a fall of 99.26 points over Tuesdays close. Shares of the company plunged 4.5 per cent to Rs 1,929.65, the sharpest fall since April 2. The rest of the technology pack also buckled as concerns grew that they might not be able to post robust numbers either.

 On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the BSE IT index saw the largest fall of 168 points or 3.34 per cent among all the sectoral indices.With the IT sector largely expected to disappoint, market experts say much will now depend on other sectors. If the stock markets have to move up from here and stabilise above the 15000-mark, the other industries will have to perform really well, said an analyst with a foreign brokerage who did not wish to be identified.

 Last Friday, the BSE sensex had hit the magical 15000-mark and observers have said its future course would depend on India Incs quarterly numbers. Broking circles here added that the fall might have been sharper if it hadnt been arrested by expectations of a strong showing by other sectors like cement.

 ACC and Grasim Industries saw brisk activity even as foreign funds scooped up shares of consumer durable and metal companies. Realty stocks also remained in the limelight. The recently-listed DLF saw its market capitalisation crossing the Rs 1-trillion mark. Sentiment was weak when the markets opened for trade today, triggered by the 148 point fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday after Standard amp; Poors and Moodys slashed their ratings on many bonds backed by risky home loans. The Asian markets also opened in a weak territory. The Infosys guidance, which came ahead of market hours, did not provide any comfort either. 

 Even as brokerages lowered their EPS estimates and price target for Infosys, which has a 10 per cent weightage on the BSE Sensex, not all are worried. Analysts said Infosys was known to give conservative guidance. They added that the company was likely to surprise on the positive side in the current quarter.

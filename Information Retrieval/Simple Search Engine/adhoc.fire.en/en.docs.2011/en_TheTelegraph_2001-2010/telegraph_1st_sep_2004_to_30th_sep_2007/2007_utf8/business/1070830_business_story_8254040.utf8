 StanChart keen on Islamic banking

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, Aug. 29: Standard Chartered Bank sees great opportunity in Sharia (Islamic Law)-compliant finance products in the country, which is home to 150 million Muslims.

 Islamic law, based on the Sharia principles, considers a payment of interest a vice. Hence, Islamic banking products have to be structured in such a way that banks wont have to pay interests on deposits or charge interests on loans. The products are designed on the principle of sharing of profit and loss.

 Islamic banking is not allowed in India under the current banking regulation act. However, the Reserve Bank of India allows financial products based on Sharia through the non-banking finance route in a particular region. 

 Standard Chartered Bank is the worlds largest underwriter of Islamic banking products and has a presence in 57 countries. We are keen to launch such products here because India has the second largest Muslim population after Indonesia. We would be interested in offering the products when the RBI allows it, said Arijit De, spokesperson for Standard Chartered in India. 

 RBI official Alpana Kilawala said no bank had yet sought the regulators approval to offer Islamic banking products in the country. 

 The RBI had constituted a committee headed by Anand Sinha, chief general manager in charge of banking operations and development, in July 2005 to study the possibilities of Islamic banking. The committee recommended that such products could not be allowed under existing regulations. Later, the apex bank set up an internal group to allow overseas branches of domestic banks to offer the products.

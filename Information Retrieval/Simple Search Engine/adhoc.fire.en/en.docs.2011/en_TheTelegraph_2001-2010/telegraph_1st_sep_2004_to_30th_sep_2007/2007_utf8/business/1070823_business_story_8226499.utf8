 Stocks see-saw all day

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 22: Stock markets witnessed volatile trading today with the sensex opening strong and then succumbing to profit booking only to gain 260 points at close.

 Market observers said the rebound was because of a rally in select heavyweights on hopes of a cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve of the US. 

 Local institutions also bought at lower levels, fuelling the rally till the end. 

 A broker said most of the players remained cautious. There were mixed signals from Delhi with some reports talking about a reconciliation on the nuclear issue. As there were no major tension between the government and the Left, the index ended in a positive territory, the broker said. 

 The sensex opened at 14055.40 and inched up on all-round buying. However, towards noon, sellers took over, pushing the benchmark index to an intra-day low of 13870.70. 

 This was followed by a rebound and the index ended at 14248.66, a gain of 259.55 points or 1.86 per cent. The S amp;P CNX Nifty of the National Stock Exchange bounced 78.25 points, or 1.92 per cent, to close at 4153.15 against 4074.90 yesterday. 

 Domestic financial institutions and mutual funds were buyers in select categories of stocks, including capital goods, metals and telecom. Bharti Airtel and Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) were among the heavyweights that witnessed brisk activity. The Bharti scrip increased by more than 4 per cent and L amp;T by more than 3 per cent. 

 Other gainers included Reliance Industries, Reliance Communications and ICICI Bank.

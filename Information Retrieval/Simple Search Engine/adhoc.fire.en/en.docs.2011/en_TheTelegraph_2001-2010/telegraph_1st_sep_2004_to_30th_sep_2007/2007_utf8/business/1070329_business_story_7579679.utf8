 Rupee rallies, sensex sinks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 28: The rupee today shot up to a seven-year high against the dollar as a liquidity crunch in the money markets, coupled with high capital inflows, triggered dollar sales by banks. The Indian currency finished at 43.05, its strongest level since June 1999.

 While the greenbacks weakness at the global stage contributed to the rupees gain, it was aided by the absence of any intervention from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The rupee had opened sharply higher at 43.18 per dollar from Mondays close of 43.30.

 The Indian currency has been gaining against the dollar this month due to a liquidity crunch in the banking system following advance tax payments, put at around Rs 40,000 crore. This month, the inter-bank call money rates (the rates at which banks borrow from each other) had also shot up to 80 per cent. Dealers said today the overnight call money rates were firm at 30 per cent. 

 In such a situation, banks were seen offloading dollars and using the rupee generated from such sales to lend in the call money market. 

 The central bank has not been intervening as any dollar purchase (resulting in the Indian currency being released into the system) could push up inflation. Forex analysts expect the rupee to continue appreciating against the dollar for a few days more. 

 The impact of the rupees appreciation against the dollar was also felt on the stock markets. Investors were seen selling IT shares as any rise in the rupees value could hit the earnings of these companies during the year. 

 Reflecting the bearish sentiment on the bourses, the sensex resumed weak at 13034.27 and gradually dropped to close the day at 12884.34, a loss of 239.98 points, or 1.83 per cent, from the last close of 13124.32. Among infotech stocks, Infosys slumped by Rs 64.70 to Rs 1,992.30, TCS by Rs 60.25 to Rs 1,201.00, Wipro by Rs 27.95 to Rs 558.20 and Satyam by Rs 16.65 to Rs 455.60.

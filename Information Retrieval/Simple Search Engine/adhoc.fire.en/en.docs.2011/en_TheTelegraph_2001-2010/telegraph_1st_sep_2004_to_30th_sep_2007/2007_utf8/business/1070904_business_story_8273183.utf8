 Export growth in July dips to 18.5%

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: July was a bad month for Indian exports with the growth rate slowing to 18.52 per cent from a healthy 40.67 per cent during the same month last fiscal, according to official figures released today.

 With imports growing faster than exports, the countrys trade deficit widened by 25 per cent to $5.01 billion in July higher than $4 billion a year earlier but narrower than $7.33 billion in June. 

 Trade deficit widened in July as companies imported more oil, machinery and aircraft to cope with soaring demand. 

 Exports in July grew 18.5 per cent to $12.5 billion and imports rose 20.4 per cent to $17.5 billion. However, in rupee terms, exports managed an improvement of only 3.10 per cent, while imports were up 4.74 per cent. 

 Export growth of over 18 per cent shows resilience of our exporters who are able to compete in the world market against all odds, said commerce minister Kamal Nath. 

 The strong growth in the economy has led to an increase in import of oil, machinery and capital goods for firms keen to expand. Demand for consumer goods has also increased from an affluent middle class. Non-oil imports, a barometer of economic activity, rose 25.9 per cent in July from a year earlier to $12.46 billion.

 On a sequential basis, export growth during July was higher than 14 per cent in June this year. However, as department stores in Europe and the US buy products for Christmas well in advance, exports in July are usually higher. 

 Nath expressed confidence that despite a slowdown, the export target of $160 billion for this fiscal would be met. 

 The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) said export performance was good, given the behaviour of the rupee. 

 However, it expressed concern over the decline in growth of traditional exports. 

 During April-July 2007-08, exports rose to $46.8 billion from 18.2 per cent a year earlier and imports grew 30.7 per cent to $72.42 billion. 

 Trade deficit for the first four months in this fiscal was $25.62 billion, an increase of more than 60 per cent from $15.84 billion a year earlier, the data showed.

 Sugar mills grapple with glut in output

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 5: Sugar firms, which have already been hit by low realisations because of production outstripping demand, expect similar conditions this year too. This is because global output is likely to remain high.

 A high global output and consequent soft prices will not allow domestic companies to earn adequate returns from exports. This will compel them to concentrate on the domestic market characterised by unattractive prices and falling margins.

 In June last year, the Centre imposed a ban on sugar exports to bring down the rate of inflation. 

 However, the ban was lifted in January this year. While Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are some of the leading sugar producing states, major manufacturers include Balrampur Chini, Bajaj Hindusthan and Shree Renuka Sugars.

 The annual demand for sugar in India is around 19 million tonnes. The sugar season usually lasts from October to March. But 2006-07 saw surplus domestic production because of a bumper crop.

 According to industry circles, total output, including buffer stocks, is 28 million tonnes. At the same time, excess production in other sugar producing countries such as Brazil led to global prices plummeting. International sugar prices, which were hovering around $500 per tonne, plummeted to less than $300 per tonne.

 The lifting of the ban on exports did not help us as it came at a time when global prices had fallen even below the domestic prices, a leading manufacturer said. The official added that though local players were also making by-products such as alcohol and molasses (which is used for ethanol), demand for these commodities is not growing at high rates. Further, output of these by-products has also been rising in line with sugar production and there too, the prices have softened, he said.

 The situation is unlikely to improve during the current year, as domestic production is set to rise. According to estimates, domestic output during 2007-08 can go up to 34 million tonnes; a glut can also be seen in international markets with excess production likely to be around 8 million tonnes.

 The year (2007-08) could be worse as there is an expectation that prices both locally and globally will fall even further. Unless the government comes out with some incentives, we will continue to have tough times, the manufacturer added.

 Calcutta, March 30: The central government will not reduce its stake in public sector banks below 51 per cent, according to Pawan Kumar Bansal, the Union minister for state for finance, banking and insurance.

 We have reached the third phase of reforms in the financial sector. However, the government strongly feels that it must maintain its majority shareholding in public sector banks at 51 per cent while giving their board of directors ample freedom in operations, Bansal said. 

 He was speaking at a seminar on Emerging Financial Sector Reforms Banking amp; Insurance organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce here today.

 Banks are the backbone of a countrys economic development. Hence, they should be under strict regulations. However, we will entrust the board of directors to run these banks smoothly and efficiently. We are happy to give them broad operational guidelines to achieve the social objectives and not interfere with their daily functioning, Bansal said.

 We (the government) also want the 10 per cent cap on voting rights by foreign investors in private sector banks to go. But the amendment to the banking regulation act could not be made as a consensus could not be attained. This is a drag at the moment, the minister said.

 He also said 80 districts in the country were underbanked and public sector banks (who are sponsors of regional rural banks) would open at least one regional rural bank branch in each of these districts. 

 Encouraged by the commendable performance by banks in achieving the lending target to the agriculture sector ahead of schedule, the government has decided to make available Rs 2,25,000 crore loans to farmers in 2007-08 and bring 50 lakh new farmers in the credit net.

 Earlier, banks were asked to double their lending to the agriculture sector from Rs 75,000 crore to Rs 150,000 crore in three years. But the feat was achieved in two years only. 

 Banks have lent Rs 1,90,000 crore to the agriculture sector in 2006-07 against a target of Rs 175,000 crore. During the year, the target was to include 50 lakh new farmers, but actually 60 lakh were given loans, the minister said.

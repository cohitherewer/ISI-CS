 Afcons in Aussie mining pact

 SAMBIT SAHA

Port Luis (Mauritius), Feb. 20: Afcons Construction Ltd, the Shapoorji Pallonji group infrastructure company, has joined hands with an Australian company for deep pit mining in India.

 The consortium of Afcons and Australias Walter Mining Pty Ltd will seek opportunities in the relatively unexplored area of underground coal mining.

 Under the agreement, the companies can also set up a joint venture in future.

 Afcons managing director K. Subrahmanian said the company is excited about the new business, which has a huge potential in India.

 India has done more of open cast mining in coal so far. We have not gone beyond 250-300 metres in underground mines, he added. Globally, coal is also excavated at a depth of 1,000-1,600 metres.

 Afcons has appointed a consultant to prepare a roadmap. The consultant will submit the plan in the next two to three months.

 The move is advantageous for Afcons as the country prepares to step up coal production to meet domestic demands, especially from the power sector.

 Coal India Ltd alone is likely to invest Rs 15,000-20,000 crore in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan starting 2007. A large portion of the work will be outsourced to private sectors. 

 Captive mining will also pick up, which will give more opportunities to companies like Afcons, which specialises in industrial construction.

 Mining will be a new territory for the Shapoorji Pallonji outfit, which will come out with a public issue in March. The company has till now focused on marine engineering in ports and speciality bridges.

 Overseas play

 S. Paramsivan, executive director (finance amp; commercial), said Afcons will also strengthen its presence in the African and West Asian countries. 

 Mauritius has already sought investment from the Indian port sector for a transhipment hub, which will be similar to the hub in Singapore.

 Mohummud Siddick Chady, chairman of Mauritius Port Authority (MPA), said the island plans to invest Mauritius Rupees 15 billion ($450 million) in the next five to 10 years on ports. 

 Afcons, which is currently implementing an oil jetty project in Mauritius, is expecting to bag a big slice of the contract.

 We are happy with the way Afcons is working, Shekur Suntah, deputy director general of MPA, said. He felt that half of the ports projected investment might come from India.

 An international competitive bidding process will be followed to award new projects. However, the credentials of Afcons may help it bag more projects in future.

 MPA is preparing a plan to develop the port sector and the waterfront. 

 The focus will be on both container and bulk cargo. Mauritius had handled 5.7 million tonnes cargo (container and bulk) in 2006.

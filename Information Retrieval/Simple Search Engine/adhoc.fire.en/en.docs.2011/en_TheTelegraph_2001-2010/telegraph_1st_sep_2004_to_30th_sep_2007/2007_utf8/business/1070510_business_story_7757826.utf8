 Vodafone pays less for Hutch deal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 9: Vodafone today completed its acquisition of Hutch Essar, paying $180 million less than the original offer price.

 The UK-based worlds largest mobile operator paid a discounted price of $10.9 billion in cash to Hong Kong-based Hutchison Telecom International Limited (HTIL) against $11.08 billion announced earlier. 

 The lower payment of $180 million reflects retention and closing adjustments as agreed with Hutchison Telecom.

 It also included provisions for a previously announced settlement pact with Indian partner Essar.

 I am delighted we have completed this important transaction and can move on to the process of integration, Vodafone CEO Arun Sarin said.

 India is a tremendously exciting, fast moving market and I am confident that Hutch Essars business will have a major contribution to the Vodafone groups revenues in the coming years, Sarin added.

 The transaction was completed on May 8, HTIL, which sold its entire stake in the company, said in a release.

 The stage is now set for Vodafone to start its operations in India, which is witnessing an addition of five million new mobile subscribers every month. 

 Hutch Essar will become Vodafone Essar over a period of time.

 Sources said Vodafone will have to pay an additional interest to HTIL for the three- month delay in closing the deal. However, when contacted, Vodafone officials refused to divulge details.

 The estimated pre-tax gain from the sale is expected to be $9 billion to HTIL. 

 The net cash inflow to HTIL before payment of the settlement amount is about $10.83 billion.

 HTIL is expected to declare a special dividend of 6.75 HK dollars per share following the completion of the necessary formalities.

 Commenting on the transaction, Hutchison Telecom chairman Canning Fok said: Today marks the conclusion of a successful venture for Hutchison Telecom.

 We exit the Indian market as one of the best capitalised telecom companies in the region which will enable us to react swiftly to new opportunities and to accelerate growth in our existing markets, he said.

 Earlier, the deal was cleared by the foreign investment promotion board, which looked into allegations of breach of foreign direct investment norms in the company.

 India allows a maximum fdi of 74 per cent in the telecom sector.

 Vodafone acquired 52 per cent direct stake of htil in hutch-essar, while indian partner essar holds 33 per cent and three minority shareholders the remaining 15 per cent. Pti hsr akj bj skb rhp km 05091314 del

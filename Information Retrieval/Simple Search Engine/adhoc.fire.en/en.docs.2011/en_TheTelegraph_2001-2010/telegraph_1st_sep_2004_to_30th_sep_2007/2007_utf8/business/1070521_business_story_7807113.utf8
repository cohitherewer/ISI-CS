 Mega clearing unit on way 

 JAYATI GHOSE

 New Delhi, May 20: The entity replacing the 1,054 clearing houses for bank transactions is likely to be up and running in the next six months.

 Though the Left parties have opposed the setting up of the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the standing committee on finance has accepted the proposal and the government is likely to go ahead with its plans for the entity. The setting up of the NPCI requires legislative changes.

 Public sector banks will hold 50 per cent stake in the company, while private players and foreign financial institutions will each have a 20 per cent stake.

 The State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and Union Bank have pledged Rs 10 crore each in the NPCI, said Unnikrishnan, deputy chief executive, Indian Banks Association. The total paid-up capital of the company will be Rs 100 crore and authorised capital Rs 300 crore.

 Among the private players, ICICI and HDFC have put in Rs 10 crore each in the NPCI, he said, adding that the entity will be in place in the next six months. HSBC and Citibank are the two foreign players which have agreed to contribute Rs 10 crore each to the paid-up capital.

 The NPCI will take over the activities of 1,054 clearing houses that handles both paper-based and electronic transactions.

 The clearing houses are autonomous, voluntary bodies set up by banks. The proposed entity would bring all these centres under one umbrella .

 The paper-based transactions are in cheques, drafts, and payment orders. Transactions in credit and debit crads are done through the electronic clearing system (ECS). 

 ECS operates from 64 centres in the country. Of this 15 are managed by the RBI and the rest by the SBI and other PSU banks.

 The electronic funds transfer system and the national electronic funds transfer system are used to despatch money by wire across accounts. They are operated by the RBI.

 Banking expert U.S. Bhargava said, The NPCI will take over the job of inter-bank cheque clearance from the RBI, without affecting the central banks income.

 According to finance ministry officials, All banks have the freedom to buy a stake in the NPCI. However, no bank can hold more than 10 per cent.

 SAIL gets Chiria boost

 New Delhi, Sept. 23 (PTI): Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is understood to have favoured assigning the Chiria mines to Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) and is believed to have asked the Jharkhand government to ensure it.

 SAIL already enjoys the support of the steel ministry over the ownership of the two-billion-tonne iron ore mines. The company contested the issue after the Madhu Koda government approached Jharkhand High Court. This followed a decision of the mining tribunal to allocate iron ore to the PSU.

 In a letter to the Jharkhand government, the Prime Minister is understood to have suggested that it should expedite allocation of the mines to SAIL at the earliest to safeguard its interest, sources said.

 Singh is said to have told the state government that the interest of the PSU cannot be compromised and in view of its capacity expansion, all the ore from the mines will have to be reserved for it.

 The Prime Minister has asked the state to allow SAIL access up to one billion tonnes of iron ore immediately. The company and the state government can strike a separate deal for the remaining ore to allow SAIL mine the mineral for meeting its capacity expansion in Bokaro, the sources added.

 However, no confirmation could be obtained from the Prime Ministers Office.

 Steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan had also said that two billion tonnes of ore would be given to SAIL. If theres any remaining mineral, it will be reserved for private players. He has opposed sharing of the ore as that could be prejudicial to the long-term interest of the steel company, a steel ministry official said. 

 Paswans deputy Akhilesh Das had in a recent statement in Parliament ruled out any possibility of an alliance with ArcelorMittal on sharing of ore. He said SAILs existing iron ore resources were insufficient to meet its long-term needs and therefore it was not in a position to share the mineral.

 SAIL, through its merger with IISCO last year, had won the mining rights to three of the six blocks in Chiria.

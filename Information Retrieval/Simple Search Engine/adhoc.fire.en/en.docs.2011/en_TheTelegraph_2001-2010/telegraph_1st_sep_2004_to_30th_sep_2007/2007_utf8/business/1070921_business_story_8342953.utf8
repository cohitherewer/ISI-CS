 BPCL venture plans flotation

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept 20: Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd, a joint venture between Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Oman Oil Corp, is planning to raise up to Rs 1,200 crore through an initial public offering (IPO) by March next year.

 The proceeds from the issue will be used to fund Bharat Omans 6-million-tonne refinery that is coming up at Bina in Madhya Pradesh.

 BPCL will hold close to 50 per cent and Oman Oil around 3 per cent in the joint venture. The remaining stake is for private investors and the public. 

 A consortium of 20 lenders, largely made up of domestic banks and financial institutions, will offer a 14-year loan worth Rs 6,387 crore to the venture.

 With the total project cost at over Rs 10,000 crore, close to Rs 4,000 crore is the equity component.

 Speaking to newspersons after the companys annual general meeting here today, BPCL chairman Ashok Sinha said key orders have been placed for the project.

 As part of the project, there will be a 930-kilometre oil pipeline from Vadinar on the Gujarat coast to Bina.

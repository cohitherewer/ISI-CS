 If youre dying for a bear hug, join Murjani workshop

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 3: A bear hug is what the stock markets will avoid at all costs at this point of time, but this is what Murjani Group wants to give to its customers. The group, which brought international brands like Tommy Hilfiger to India, will introduce a unique retail concept called Build-A-Bear Workshop, where guests make their own customised stuffed animals, typically bears.

 The first flagship store based on this concept was opened in the US in 1997. There are now more than 270 stores in the US, Canada, the UK and Ireland in addition to franchise stores in Europe, Asia and Australia. In India, such outlets will make their debut in Mumbai at Shoppers Stop in Juhu and Inorbit Mall in Malad. Workshops will also be opened in two more retail outlets in New Delhi.

 Under the concept, owned by Build-A-Bear Workshop Inc, guests visiting the workshop can create and make their own customised stuffed animals. The guests first choose the kind and type of bear to make and then dress it up with an array of clothes and accessories. Guests can choose from 25 stuffed animals.

 Such a store has eight bear-making stations. Visitors stuff the animal and then add outfits and accessories. The entire process costs between Rs 595 and Rs 1,295. It could go up if more accessories are used.

 Murjani Group chairman Mohan Murjani told The Telegraph that the workshop would not be the usual toy shop where customers simply buy a product over the counter. This is a different experience altogether of building bears and even giving them a life. The concept should be a success as Indians are family-oriented people.

 Murjani added that the group focused on three segments luxury, premium and speciality. The Build-A-Bear Workshop falls in the third category. Some of the international brands, which the group has brought to India, include Tommy Hilfiger, Gucci, La Perla and Calvin Klein. Moreover, Tumi, the leading international brand of prestige travel, business and lifestyle accessories, also entered into an exclusive, long-term agreement with the group to market and retail its products in India. Murjani said though the group is considering bringing more brands to the country, the focus will be on unique ones. By the end of this year, the group will have bought around 10 international brands to the country.

 Indranil Chakraborty, business head of Build-A-Bear Workshop, said the concept is likely to be introduced in Calcutta by the end of 2008. 

 The company also plans to take this concept to other cities and towns in the country.

 State Bank siblings sizzle 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 15: Shares of the listed subsidiaries of the State Bank of India shot up on the BSE today after a Lok Sabha vote paved the way for the SBI to dilute its stake in the seven subsidiaries to 51 per cent.

 The SBI Bikaner amp; Jaipur scrip rose to Rs 4131.85, a gain of Rs 190.35 or 4.83 per cent, from yesterday.

 Shares of the SBI Mysore increased by 10 per cent to close at Rs 6,847.55 compared with Rs 6,225.05 yesterday.

 The SBI Travancore scrip was higher at Rs 4,178 compared with Rs 3,979.05 previously, a gain of 5 per cent.

 The SBI has a 100 per cent stake in the SBI Hyderabad, Patiala and Saurashtra. 

 In the other four subsidiaries the SBI Bikaner amp; Jaipur, Mysore, Travancore and Indore the shareholding varies from 75 per cent to 98 per cent. 

 Observers said the shares rose following some comments by finance minister P. Chidambaram in the Lok Sabha today. Chidambaram said the move to dilute the SBIs stake would strengthen the associate banks. 

 The banks now have many options to raise funds, such as a private placement.

 The finance minister said the government would not reduce its stake in a PSU bank to below 51 per cent. 

 The government would also retain the majority of voting rights.

 Chidambaram ruled out the possibility of a merger of the seven banks with the SBI.

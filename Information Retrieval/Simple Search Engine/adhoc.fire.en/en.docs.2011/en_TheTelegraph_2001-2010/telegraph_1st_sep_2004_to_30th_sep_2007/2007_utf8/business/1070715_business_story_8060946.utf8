 Cyber law ready

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 14: The ministry of information technology has drafted the national cyber security strategy to help counter cyber fraud. The draft would be tabled at an apex council comprising the National Information Board, National Security Council and the cabinet secretariat.

 The amendment of the IT Act, set to be tabled in the monsoon session of Parliament, would pave the way for the cyber security strategy. The draft is already circulating within the department, said B.J. Srinath, senior director of the IT departments Indian Computer Emergency Response Team.

 The Rs 200-crore Indian Institute of Information Technology specialising in security is being set up in Bengal.

 We have been told by the HRD ministry that the proposal for the institute would be incorporated in the Eleventh Plan. The institute will be based on the public-private model and would require 100 acres of land, said Bengal IT minister Debesh Das.

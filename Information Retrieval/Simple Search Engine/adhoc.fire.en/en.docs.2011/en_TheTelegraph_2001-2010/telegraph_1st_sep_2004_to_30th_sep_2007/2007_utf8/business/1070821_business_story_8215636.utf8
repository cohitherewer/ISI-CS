 Kilburn to sell Bhandup land

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 20: Kilburn Engineering Ltd will sell its 8.23-acre property at Bhandup in Mumbai to Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd for Rs 124.7 crore.

 This is the largest land-sale deal by a BM Khaitan group company. As the Bhandup land is the site of the present Kilburn factory, the relocation will take place in stages. We have already shifted part of the operations to a nearby location. This deal will give Kilburn a healthy balancesheet, said Amritanshu Khaitan, a director of Kilburn Engineering.

 The company manufactures driers for various industry segments. The company will use the money from the land sale to set up a state-of-the-art factory in a new location at an investment of Rs 45 crore.

 We are looking at an eight-to-10-acre plot within 25 to 30km of our old site so as not to cause inconvenience to our employees. The blueprint of the new plant is ready and the land will be finalised in the next one or two days, Khaitan said. The new plant will be completed in 12 to 15 months. The new site, which is outside the Mumbai municipality area, will also help the engineering firm save on the octroi duty of 4 per cent on raw material. 

 On whether shareholders will receive the benefits of the transaction, Khaitan said, The board will subsequently take a decision. We cannot comment at this moment. However, one would usually want to reward shareholders. 

 The sale proceeds will also help the company focus on acquisitions and product diversification. Kilburn is looking at companies in the US and Europe that have similar product lines and can serve as its marketing arm.

 Around 60 per cent of the drier manufacturers turnover came from exports last fiscal.

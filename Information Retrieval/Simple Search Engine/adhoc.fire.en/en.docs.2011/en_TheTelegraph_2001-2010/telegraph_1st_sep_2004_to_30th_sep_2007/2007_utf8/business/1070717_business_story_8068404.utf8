 Europe move on liquor lifts spirits

 New Delhi, July 16: The European Union has suspended the dispute panel initiated at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over the additional duties imposed by India on imported wines and spirits.

 This comes after India abolished additional customs duty or countervailing duty on liquor imports while hiking the basic duty on wine from 100 per cent to 150 per cent.

 Welcoming the EUs move, Sunil Mendiratta, secretary of the Wine and Spirits Association of India, said, We will monitor the implementation of non-discriminatory levies at the state level. 

 Raju Vaziraney, CEO of Diageo Radico Distilleries Pvt Ltd, said, The move shows that the EU has acknowledged our progressive steps and the WTO has reinforced its confidence in India.

 However, wine exporters like Rohit Mehra, managing director of Mohan Brothers, are unhappy with the turn of events. Terming the situation as messy, he said, though it is a good sign, it will not help the wine industry much. 

 There has never been a clash between Indian and foreign wines. But states like Maharashtra have imposed exorbitant taxes on foreign liquor, Mehra said.

 The WTO panel has not been disbanded totally. It will remain suspended for one year. The European Commission is monitoring the situation to make sure that no new discrimination appear at the state level.

 State-level taxes, which were quite high, will be brought down to levels faced by domestic liquor manufacturers.

 Siddharth Banerjee, managing director of Kyndal Pvt Ltd, said, Instead of totally disbanding it, the panel has been suspended probably to watch the full ramification of the situation.

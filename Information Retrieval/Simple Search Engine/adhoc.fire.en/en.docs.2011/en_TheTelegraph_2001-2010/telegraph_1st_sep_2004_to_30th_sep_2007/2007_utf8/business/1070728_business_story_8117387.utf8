 Calcutta, July 27: CESC is awaiting coal mine allotment from the Centre to start work on the new plant that promises to reduce power cuts in the city.

 The company has received enough land about 300 acres at Haldia and also clearance for the use of water to set up the first phase of the 2,000mw project.

 Vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said finance for the initial 600mw had been tied up too.

 Getting the coal block is a priority for us. Once the block is allotted, CESC will spare no time in starting work, Goenka said after the 29th annual general meeting of the company here today.

 The first phase of the project will cost Rs 2,000 crore. The company has spoken to major equipment suppliers.

 Since Bengal does not have enough coal resources to cater to the demand, CESC is looking at a Jharkhand block to feed the Haldia plant.

 The demand in CESC command area the city and its surroundings reaches 1300-1350mw during the peak summer season.

 CESCs own generation is now pegged at 950mw.

 We are ready to buy power at every possible price to meet the peak demand. So it is imperative for us to get on with the new project as soon as possible, Goenka added.

 He said the company would raise funds during this year to part-finance its capital expenditure programme and the decision would be taken by October. The company is also going ahead with its proposed two 1000mw power plants in Jharkhand and Orissa.

 In the first quarter of 2007-08, CESC has posted a 49 per cent rise in profit after tax on the back of a 9 per cent topline growth and a reduced interest cost outgo.

 However, Goenka wondered if the companys production performance could be improved any further given that it worked at 99.37 per cent plant load factor in the first quarter. Goenka feels retail (Spencers) and real estate will provide the impetus to CESCs business.

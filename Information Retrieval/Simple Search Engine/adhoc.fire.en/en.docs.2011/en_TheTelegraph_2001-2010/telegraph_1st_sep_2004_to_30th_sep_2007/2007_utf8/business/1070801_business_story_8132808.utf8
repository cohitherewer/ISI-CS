 New Delhi, July 31: State-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited will invite fresh bids for installing up to 50 million GSM lines. 

 I am told they are ready to go for a bigger tender of 40-50 million lines... (this) process must be completed in the stipulated time, may be within 8-9 months, telecom minister A. Raja said today.

 The move is part of BSNLs plans to expand operations and compete with private operators.

 The minister added that the new tender might have a third-generation (3G) technology component in it. 

 BSNL would be inviting bids from global players, including US-based Motorola, which was disqualified in the earlier tender along with its Chinese partner ZTE, sources said.

 The move came after BSNL, on Rajas advice, slashed the size of its original tender for 45.5 million GSM lines, which Ericsson and Nokia had won, by almost half.

 VRS offer

 BSNL has sent a proposal to DoT seeking an approval for a voluntary retirement scheme for 20,000 employees in the first phase. 

 However, the public sector telecom giant also plans to hire more managers and engineers to improve operations. 

 The company has a huge workforce of 3.6 lakh employees. We have written to the government proposing a VRS for 20,000 employees in the C and D groups (clerks, technicians, supervisors and linesmen). They (DoT) have some queries and we will shortly reply to them, outgoing BSNL chairman A.K.Sinha said.

 Franklin stake in Dubai firm

 Prize catch 

 Dubai, Sept. 4 (Reuters): Franklin Templeton Investments has bought a 25 per cent stake in Dubais Algebra Capital Ltd. 

 Franklin Templeton is a unit of Franklin Resources Inc, the fourth-largest publicly traded fund manager in the US. 

 Franklin Templeton manages assets worth $621 billion. The acquisition will help it grow its business in the Arab, the company said today.

 Algebra expects the value of assets in professionally managed funds in West Asia and North Africa to triple to more than $200 billion over the next five years, it said in a statement announcing the deal.

 The two companies declined to disclose the value of the deal, which gives Franklin Templeton two seats on Algebras board.

 We see tremendous opportunity to grow our business in the Gulf, West Asia and North Africa, Greg Johnson, chief executive of Franklin Resources, said.

 The two companies will develop and distribute investment products together. Algebra and Franklin Templetons private equity arm, Darby Overseas, will collaborate on investments in West Asia and North Africa.

 Algebra Capital is based in Dubai International Financial Centre, a self regulating investment zone set up by the Gulf Emirate in 2004 to attract financial services providers to the worlds biggest oil-exporting region.

 Dubai is part of the United Arab Emirates. It is one of the Gulf countries trying to draw foreign capital into its two stock markets, which lost more than 40 per cent of their value last year. The Dubai bourse will showcase its companies to investors in New York in November .

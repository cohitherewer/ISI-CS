 Positive thinking on wine row

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Hope bubbles

 New Delhi, March 27: India hopes to resolve the wine issue amicably with the European Union, even as the latter has stepped up its offensive at the WTO.

 According to a senior official, It will take at least six months for the WTO hearings to be completed and we hope to have the necessary legislation in place to bring down duties on wine and spirits much earlier than that.

 Indian officials see the European Unions move to fuel the dispute as a pressure tactic to get it moving on the issue. 

 EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson has said, As we could not resolve our dispute in consultations, the EU sees no other way than to request the establishment of a WTO panel. We are of course not closing the door to an amicable solution but the ball is now in Indias court.

 The Indian government is likely to move a bill in Parliament next month to lower customs duty on imported wines and spirits. 

 This would also pave the way for cheaper retail prices of these beverages in the domestic market. 

 The finance ministry is expected to draw up a proposal which will soon be taken to the cabinet for approval. The bill is likely to come when Parliament meets after a three-week recess, according to a senior official.

 The proposed legislation is expected to retain the basic customs duty but scrap the additional customs duty. The new law would also make it mandatory for all the states to levy excise duty on imported liquor equivalent to that imposed on wines and spirits produced in India. 

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath had told EU agriculture commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel earlier this month that India was trying to find a way to lower the high duty structure on imported wines and spirits as certain legislative issues linked to the matter would have to be sorted out first. But clearly the European Union does not want to leave anything to chance. 

 Nath also brought up the issue of Indian whisky not being treated on a par with European whisky but Fischer Boel refused to budge on the issue.

 She maintained that all whiskies in Europe were made from grain, while Indian whisky was distilled from molasses as a result of which the two could not be treated on the same footing.

 Reddy and Chidambaram: Money matters 

 New Delhi, July 10: Reserve Bank of India governor Y.V. Reddy today met finance minister P. Chidambaram here to discuss measures to check the rupees appreciation and bank credit flow. 

 Officials said Chidambaram and Reddy also discussed interest rates and strategies on inflation, which has come down to 4.13 per cent. 

 Between January and June, the rupee has appreciated by around 10 per cent, affecting exports in some sectors such as textiles, IT, leather, gems and jewellery. 

 Sources said in the meeting, Reddy opposed the finance ministrys proposal to use part of the over $200 billion of foreign exchange reserves as insurance for infrastructure projects. 

 The apex bank had earlier said the proposal did not conform to section 17 (12B) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. The clause permits the RBI to use foreign currency for loans to finance capital goods imports but not for insurance. According to the ministrys proposal, which was first made in the budget, credit guarantee insurance will be given through an overseas subsidiary of Indian Infrastructure Finance Corporation Limited, a government-owned entity. This will allow companies to raise long-term resources more easily in global markets for infrastructure projects. 

 The meeting, ahead of the central banks quarterly monetary policy review scheduled for July 31, went on for over an hour. It was also attended by RBI deputy governor Rakesh Mohan and the chief economic adviser to the government, Ashok Lahiri. 

 However, Reddy refused to say what transpired at the meeting. If I have to tell anything, I will tell you, he said. 

 Mohan, too, declined to comment on the discussions. Earlier, Chidambaram had said the government was contemplating relief to exporters from the rising rupee. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had also assured exporters of sops.

 The forthcoming quarterly review is likely to announce the relief as well as steps to check inflation from rising beyond 4.5 per cent.

 Bitter duty taste for Scotch

 KAKOLY CHATTERJEE

 No cheer

 New Delhi, Aug. 14: Scotch whisky makers such as Diageo and Brown Forman are unhappy with Maharashtra for imposing a 200 per cent local tax on imported whisky earlier this month.

 The western state, which accounts for 30-40 per cent of all Scotch sales in the country, may face a legal tussle as Scotch whisky makers can take legal action against the high taxes. They feel this duty violates WTO rules as it is over and above the 160 per cent central customs duty that whisky companies already pay.

 Earlier, the European Union and the US had dragged the Indian government to the WTO for high duties on wines and spirits. The Indian government settled that row by unilaterally reducing duty levels. 

 Amrit Kiran Singh, chairman of the International Wine and Spirits Association of India and area director of Brown Forman, said: The heavy duty on Scotch will have a negative impact on revenue collection. It will encourage the grey market in India as the price of Scotch will be exorbitant. 

 Sales of popular brands of Scotch such as Johny Walker, Jack Daniel and Chivas Regal have dropped in Mumbai as their retail prices are now more than Rs 3,000 a bottle.

 Industry analysts feel Maharashtra is perhaps trying to protect the local whisky makers by imposing the tax. But the local malt-based whisky costs around Rs 300 to Rs 350 a bottle. So even if Scotch costs around Rs 2,000 in the absence of the new tax, it is in a different league altogether as it will hardly affect the sales of the local stuff. 

 Leading whisky companies such as Diageo and Brown-Forman, the makers of Jack Daniels, are in talks with the Maharashtra government, seeking a review of the new tax structure. Industry representatives are trying to reduce the tax to a more reasonable level. 

 India is predominantly a whisky market. While the sale of imported whisky was expected to go up after the central government cut duties, the sudden imposition of state duties had seen sales falling. 

 However, Maharashtra is the only state to have retaliated with higher taxes. Excise bodies regulating taxes in all other states, including major whisky-drinking areas such as Delhi, Bangalore and Punjab, have opted to leave taxes on imported spirits unchanged. 

 With a favourable duty structure, Scotch imports to India is expected to grow to five million cases in three years. India now imports around 500,000 to 750,000 cases every year.

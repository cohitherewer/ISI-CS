 Calcutta, June 5: ASK Investment Managers, the investment and wealth management firm promoted by Asit and Sameer Koticha, has lined up a host of services for its clients. These include mutual funds, private equity investment, insurance brokerage, art and real estate investment.

 ASK Group has recently bought out the stake of its joint venture partner, Raymond James, in ASK Raymond James.

 We will soon roll out financial planning services advisory cum investment management services, offer insurance brokerage, investments in real estate and art and private equity investment to our clients, said Sameer Koticha, director, ASK Group. We have already applied for an insurance brokerage licence, which we expect to get in three to four months. For investment management and advisory services such as art and real estate, where we dont have any in-house expertise, we will opt for strategic tie-ups or outsourcing, he added.

 ASK Group is also planning to enter the mutual fund business by floating an asset management company. It is at the discussion stage. However, we plan to launch the mutual fund business this year, Koticha said, adding that it would go alone in the mutual fund business. 

 However, the company is open to alliances for its other businesses, including equity partnership, with a suitable partner who can bring in value and business and add to our global distribution network, according to Koticha.

 ASK Investment Managers is in talks with a few art galleries and independent art advisers for a possible tie-up for its proposed financial planning services. We are in talks with a few foreign institutions to offer structured investment plans more on the lines of mutual funds for investment in overseas stocks, Koticha said.

The company currently manages assets worth $0.5 billion, including those of four offshore funds. To attract larger investment, the company is planning to offer its clients private equity investment as well within the next six months.

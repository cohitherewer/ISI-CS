 Pat for US, punch for India in plastic push

 New Delhi, May 8 (PTI): Credit card users in India

 may be paying huge ldquo;extra charges rdquo; amounting to over Rs

 1.6 crore a day, but those in the US believe that using plastic has

 a positive impact on their lives.

 According to a survey by Washington-based Financial Services

 Forum, 72 per cent of the respondents across the US are

 satisfied with the services offered by card issuers. 

 Besides,

 73 per cent said their credit card companies treat them

 fairly and 62 per cent said using a credit card has a positive

 impact on their lives. 

 The forum comprises the CEOs of world rsquo;s 20 leading banks such as

 Citigroup from the US, Britain rsquo;s HSBC, Germany rsquo;s Deutsche

 Bank, Swiss giant UBS and GE Commercial Finance.

 The survey comes within 

 a week of another study 

 conducted by the Credit Card Holders rsquo; Association of India, which

 said credit card holders in India have been ripped of 

 Rs 6,000 crore as ldquo;extra charges rdquo; by banks mdash; resulting

 in additional charges of over 

 Rs 1.64 crore a day.

 These charges, imposed on credit card users in India who

 pay the highest rates of interest in the world, are in

 the form of penalty for late payments and exceeding the

 credit limit as well as fees for services like cash advance,

 cash withdrawal and cheque pick-up, besides the service

 tax on all these fees.

 HSBC and Citigroup as well as domestic lenders like HDFC

 Bank have come under the lens of the Monopolies and Restrictive

 Trade Practices Commission on credit cards.

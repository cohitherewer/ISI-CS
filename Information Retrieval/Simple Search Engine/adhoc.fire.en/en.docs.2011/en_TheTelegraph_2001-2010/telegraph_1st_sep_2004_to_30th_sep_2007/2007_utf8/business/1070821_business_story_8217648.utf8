 Blackstone buys 50% of Gokaldas 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 20: Blackstone the global private equity giant is acquiring a 50.1 per cent stake in Gokaldas Exports from its promoters and is making an open offer to acquire another 20 per cent, totalling $165 million (Rs 682 crore).

 The deal will make it the largest investment made by a foreign entity in the countrys textile sector.

 Gokaldas Exports is Indias largest garment manufacturer. The Bangalore-based company has 47,000 employees in 46 manufacturing facilities with a system capacity to produce and export 2.5 million garments a month. It produces customised apparel for leading US and European brands, with strengths in fashion and in-house design. This is the fourth major investment by Blackstone in India. Earlier, it had invested $50 million in Emcure Pharmaceuticals, around $200 million in Ushodaya Enterprises and picked up a stake in the BPO company Intelenet for another $200 million.

 Gokaldas Exports said the acquisition would help the company become a global player in the garment sector. Blackstone is an ideal partner for us. They have a lot of investment in the textile and retail sectors globally, which will help us get more partners to work with, said Rajendra Hinduja, managing director of Gokaldas Exports. 

 Although the company did not comment on the open offer price, it is understood to be in the region of Rs 275 per share, a 20 per cent premium to the closing price of Rs 228.70 on the BSE today. 

 Gokaldas is the leading company in India in an industry that has seen significant growth in the Asian region after the garment quota was abolished in 2005. This favourable industry dynamics combined with our highest regard for the management team of Gokaldas Exports were key factors in our decision to enter into this partnership, said Blackstone Advisors India chairman and managing director Akhil Gupta.

 Following the acquisition, Blackstone will have a representation on the board of directors. The founder-promoters will continue to be on the board with Madanlal Hinduja as chairman, Rajendra Hinduja as managing director and Dinesh Hinduja as executive director.

 Gokaldas Exports, which was incorporated in 1979, had recently churned out a disappointing performance as the rupee appreciation impacted its bottomline. 

 During the first quarter ended June 30, net profit of the company dipped 22 per cent even as its topline grew. Gokaldas tried to mitigate the impact of the rupee appreciation by using imported raw materials that were more competitive, improving productivity and getting higher prices for its products. Last year, the company commissioned two new factories in Mysore and Tumkur.

 It is believed that the Hindujas will use proceeds from the stake sale to establish a special economic zone for textiles in Karnataka. There is a speculation that they are mulling a retail foray.

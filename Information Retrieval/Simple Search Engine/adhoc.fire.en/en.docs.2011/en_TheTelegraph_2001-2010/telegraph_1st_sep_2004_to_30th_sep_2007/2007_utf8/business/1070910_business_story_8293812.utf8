 Reliance Life to spend Rs 2000cr on expansion

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 9: Reliance Life Insurance Company will invest over Rs 2,000 crore to increase its reach and support an expansion programme over the next two years. The company also expects to earn new business premium worth Rs 3,000 crore during this financial year. 

 We would like to achieve top rankings in the industry during this financial year. We are rapidly expanding all our channels of distribution, especially agencies, which have grown from 9000 to over 1,25,000. Our branch office network has increased from 118 offices last year to 340 now. We are planning to enter the rural and semi-urban markets, P. Nandagopal, CEO of Reliance Life Insurance told The Telegraph.

 Unlike other private insurers, who mostly depend on the bancassurance model to distribute policies, Reliance Life Insurance receives most of its premium income from agency distribution channels. 

 The company is willing to introduce the bancassurance model but feels the agency distribution route is more cost-effective.

 The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) still holds the largest pie in the insurance sector, but increased competition among private insurers in India has reduced the LICs share over the last one year. 

 According to a recent report by Merrill Lynch, the market share of private insurers in India has increased to about 37.4 per cent from 33.3 per cent in July 2006. The report said in July this year, Reliance Life Insurance posted the highest year-on-year growth in first-year premium income at Rs 110 crore, an increase of 159 per cent.

 Reliance Life Insurance, which sold about 55,420 policies in July, achieved the highest month-on-month growth at 47 per cent, while the sector grew by only 20 per cent. The company, whose market share increased to 7.3 per cent among private life insurers in July, gained over SBI Life Insurance during the period. 

 We plan to have700 offices by the next two to three years, an official said.

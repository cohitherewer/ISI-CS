 Panel to vet PSU play in mutuals

 New Delhi, June 14: The government plans to set up a committee which will decide on whether to let PSUs invest more than 10 per cent of their reserves in mutual funds.

 This panel of secretaries will also discuss the issue of investments in private mutual funds. 

 PSUs have over Rs 3,00,000 crore of investible reserves which are mostly kept in gilts and fixed deposits till they are used for capital expenditure. However, PSUs are now seeking greater freedom in the utilisation of funds to earn more from their savings. 

 The department of public sector enterprises (DPE) has come up with a plan to allow investments in public sector-run mutual funds up to 10 per cent of a PSUs reserves. 

 However, the finance ministry feels it will be difficult to differentiate between private and public sector mutual funds, necessitating a level playing field. The ministry also wants the cap on investible resources to be more flexible, which will be decided by the PSU boards in consultation with the DPE and the administrative ministries. 

 Top officials said the proposal had run into difficulties with other ministries suggesting their own formula. 

 A committee is likely to be set up soon to decide on the vital issues of whether to allow PSUs to invest in mutual funds. If yes, then how much and where, said top officials.

 As the money involved is huge, people want to play safe, officials said. The DPE has even suggested that the government consults Parliament on the issue. 

 Everyone wants to liberalise but also play safe. If a blue chip PSU loses money in an equity-based mutual fund, there could be a huge outcry with political overtones. Hence the caution, said officials.

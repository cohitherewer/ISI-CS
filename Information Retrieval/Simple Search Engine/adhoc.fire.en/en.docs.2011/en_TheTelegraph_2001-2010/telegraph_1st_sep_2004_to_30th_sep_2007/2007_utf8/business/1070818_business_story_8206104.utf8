 New Delhi, Aug. 17: Coca-Cola is planning to invest $250 million or over Rs 1,000 crore in India over the next three years, to expand its product portfolio and revamp its distribution network.

 Atul Singh, president and CEO of Coca-Cola India, said, We will invest around $250 million within the next three years to enhance our infrastructure for sales equipment, bottling lines, other equipment, transport and logistics. We are also going to expand our product portfolio to include energy drinks, sports drinks, flavoured water and juices. 

 So far, Coca-Cola has invested $1.2 billion in India. Coca-Cola sells 55 products in India, including Coca-Cola, Thumps Up, Fanta, Maaza, Limca, Sprite and Kinley.

 Coca-Cola is also planning to open more bottling plants across the country. The company has 61 bottling plants in India. Coca-Cola owns around 65 per cent of these plants, while the others operate on a franchisee basis. 

 The company has successfully test-marketed Maaza Aam Panna in north India and Minute Maid Pulpy Orange in the south. The products are now ready to be rolled out all over the country. 

 The last four quarters have been very strong. In the last quarter, growth has been in double digits, Singh said. In the second quarter, the company increased its unit case volume by 12 per cent.

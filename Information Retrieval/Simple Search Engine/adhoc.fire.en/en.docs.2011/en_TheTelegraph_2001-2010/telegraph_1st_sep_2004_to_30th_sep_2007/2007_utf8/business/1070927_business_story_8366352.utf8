 MFs get more leeway abroad

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, Sept. 26: The capital market regulator today raised the limit on overseas investments by individual mutual funds to $300 million.

 Earlier, the limit was $200 million or 8 to 10 per cent of the total assets under management, whichever was lower.

 The relaxation comes a day after the Reserve Bank of India relaxed overseas investment norms in a move designed to rein in the rupee.

 The new limit set for individual funds is subject to the overall ceiling of $5 billion for each mutual fund house.

 The sub-ceiling linked to the net assets of a mutual fund as on March 31 of each year has been dispensed with, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a statement today.

 Sebi said the mutual funds have been allowed to invest in 10 permissible avenues, including initial and follow-on public offerings of companies listed on stock exchanges abroad and flotations of American depositary rights (ADRs) and global depositary rights (GDRs) by Indian and foreign companies.

 The capital market regulator also said the overall cap of $1 billion for investment in overseas exchange traded funds (ETFs) that invest in securities would be subject to a maximum of $50 million per mutual fund.

 The funds can also invest in foreign debt securities, money market instruments and government securities all of which must be of investment grade. They have been allowed to invest in repos where the counterparty is not rated below investment grade. There is one rider: the repos should not involve any borrowing of funds by the mutual funds.

 Investment in derivatives has been permitted on recognised stock exchanges only for hedging and portfolio balancing.

 The mutual funds can also park short-term deposits with banks overseas where the issuer is not rated below investment grade.

 They can also invest in the units or securities issued by overseas mutual funds or units trusts registered with regulators abroad.

 Sebi said the mutual fund would have to appoint a dedicated fund manager for investments abroad.

 Calcutta, April 18: Nagaland Paper Mill of Hindustan Paper Corporation will be revived after 15 years with aid from the Centre.

 The cabinet committee on economic affairs has cleared a Rs 552-crore package to revive the companys Tuli plant in Nagaland. The revival package envisages raising the capacity of the plant to 66,000 tonnes per annum.

 The Centre will offer 50 per cent of the sum as grant. The rest of the money will be in the form of loans.

 The project will be implemented in about 27 months after it gets clearance from the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR), an HPC source said. BIFR was likely to clear the proposal on May 29, sources said. Power and infrastructure problems plagued the unit in the seventies. The 33,000-tonne unit was shut down in 1992.

 Sources said a 20-mw captive power plant would be set up under the revival plan. The Nagaland government has offered to supply 3.5 lakh tonnes of green bamboo. Moreover, completion of the broad-gauge railway track to the nearest railhead and extension of National Highway 31 would ensure smooth functioning of the plant, HPC officials told The Telegraph.

 The officials said the plant would produce superior quality paper. The company will look at the markets of Myanmar and Bangladesh, besides supplying locally.

 HPC chairman Raji Philip said the company had also taken up a Rs 1,379-crore expansion and diversification project for the Cachar and Nagaon plants in Assam and its subsidiary Hindustan Newsprint Ltd in Kerala.

 Mumbai, Jan. 11: The sensex snapped its five-day losing streak today and rebounded sharply to close around 269 points higher at 13630.71.

 According to brokers, a remarkable increase in net direct tax collections, coupled with a moderate fall in the current account deficit, which earlier was a deterrent for foreign institutional investors, aided the bourses.

 The 30-share bellwether index witnessed a weak start, but later surged to an intra-day high of 13667.80 and ended the day at 13630.71, a net rise of 268.55 points, or 2.01 per cent, over its previous close of 13362.16. The sensex had fallen by 652.76 points or 4.66 per cent in the last five days.

 The nifty of the National Stock Exchange also recovered by 91.95 points, or 2.39 per cent, to close at 3942.25 from yesterdays close of 3850.30.

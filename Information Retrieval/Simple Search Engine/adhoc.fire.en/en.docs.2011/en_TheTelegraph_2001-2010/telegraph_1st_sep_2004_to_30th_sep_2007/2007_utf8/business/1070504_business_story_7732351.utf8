 Reliance Money to sell gold coins

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 3: Reliance Money will sell its own brand of gold coins to be made by Swiss firm Valcambi.

 The Anil Ambani firm will be the first non-banking finance company to retail gold coins in India.

 Gold coins are not only a hedge against inflation but also superior to jewellery, Reliance Money CEO Sudip Bandyopadhyay said today. 

 People will buy coins as it is easy to exchange and store, while for jewellery, there is no surety on purity and it involves additional costs such as making charge, he said.

 We feel it is important to add this to our portfolio of existing products and services...There is a huge scope in this as the market is dominated by unorganised players, except some banks and organisations such as Tanishq and MMTC, Bandyopadhyay added. 

 The 24-carat gold coins, with a purity certification from Valcambi, will be sold in the denominations of 5 gm and 8 gm at Reliance Money as well as Reliance World outlets of Reliance Communications. 

 Reliance Money has 2,500 outlets and plans to have 10,000 shops by the end of this fiscal. We are also planning to repurchase gold coins sold by us. The days selling and buying prices will be same, he added.

 Valcambi is a global leader in precious metal refining and operates one of the worlds largest plants at Balerna in Switzerland. The plant refined 600 tonnes in 2004.

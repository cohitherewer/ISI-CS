 Timken plans to set up unit in Chennai

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, March 25: Timken, the worlds largest roller bearing maker, has decided to set up its second manufacturing unit in the country.

 The company has zeroed in on Chennai, where the Mahindra group is developing a special economic zone (SEZ).

 The new unit, involving an investment of $25 million (Rs 112 crore) in the first phase, will begin its operations by the end of this year, Gordon W. Robinson, managing director of Timken India Ltd, said.

 Robinson told The Telegraph that the unit would focus on industrial bearings. I see a huge growth in the infrastructure sector. Our offerings from the new unit will eventually target that market, he said.

 Timken has so far emphasised on the export market, making India a global base. It is increasingly betting on the domestic consumption story. 

 Robinson said the company would not shift its focus from the Indian market despite being within an SEZ. You need to be a net exporter, he said.

 Timken entered the country in a joint venture with the Tatas in the late 80s. 

 It set up a unit in Jamshedpur, serving mostly to the rail and road sectors. It supplied bearings to the Tata Motors factory there.

 The Tatas sold their stake to Timken in 1999 and the parent company now holds an 80 per cent stake in Timken India, the listed company on local bourses.

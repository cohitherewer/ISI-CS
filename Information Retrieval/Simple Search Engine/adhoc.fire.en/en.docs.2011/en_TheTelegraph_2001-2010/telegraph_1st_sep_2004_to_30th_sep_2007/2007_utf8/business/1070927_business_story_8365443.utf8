 New Delhi, Sept. 26: DLF plans to set up its second infotech park at Rajarhat with an investment of Rs 800-1,000 crore. 

 Spread over 2.5 million sq ft, the park will have six towers. DLF officials said the project was slated to be completed by the end of 2009. The first phase is likely to be completed by the end of this year. 

 Companies such as GE, Siemens, IBM, Microsoft, Semantec and Accenture were expected to take up commercial space in these towers, the officials added.

 The park will also have a residential complex, recreational centres and malls. It is also likely to house the companys multiplex chain DT cinemas. 

 The Delhi-based realtor is estimated to have invested Rs 350 crore in the first IT park at Rajarhat. The park, covering 1.3 million sq ft, has three towers. The first tower has been taken up by IBM. 

 In the next seven to eight years, DLF plans to invest Rs 90,000-Rs 100,000 crore in Bengal. In the pipeline are a Rs 500-crore luxury retail wing to be completed by 2009 and a chain of three hotels in a joint venture with the Hilton group at an investment of Rs 1,000 crore. 

 DLF has also drawn up plans to build an integrated township in Durgapur covering 95 acres. 

 It is a public-private partnership project envisaged by the Asansol Durgapur Development Authority. 

 The project, involving an investment of up to Rs 4,000 crore, is expected to be completed in four years. 

 Based on a cross-subsidy model, the Durgapur project will have co-operative housing plots, residence for low, middle and high-income groups as well as bungalows, individual plots, commercial and retail space.

 The township will have multiple environment protection measures such as solar lights, rain-water harvesting, waste-water management and a sewage treatment plant.

 DLF officials said the cabinet in Bengal recently agreed to allow the company to directly purchase land for the development of another proposed township at Dankuni.

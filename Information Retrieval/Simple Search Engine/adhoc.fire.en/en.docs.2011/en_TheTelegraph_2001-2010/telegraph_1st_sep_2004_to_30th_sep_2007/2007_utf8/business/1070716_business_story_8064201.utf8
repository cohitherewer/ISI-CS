The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 TCG biotech arm weighs share float options

 SAMBIT SAHA

Calcutta, July 15: TCG Lifesciences is likely to become the first company of The Chatterjee Group (TCG) to go public.

 The firm, which carries out advanced research and development in biotechnology for global pharmaceutical companies in the city and Pune, is planning to expand its operations in a big way, requiring an investment of over $100 million or Rs 405 crore.

 The company is considering an initial public offering (IPO) or a private placement to investors to raise funds for the expansion. Swapan Bhattachrya, managing director of TCG Lifesciences, said the company needed to raise capital to fuel growth. 

 This issue is at a planning stage but no decision has been taken, he added. It is under consideration, Bhattacharya told The Telegraph.

 Owned by NRI businessman Purnendu Chatterjee, TCG Lifesciences is one of the few contract research organisations (CRO) to work out of the city. The company employs a large number of professionals at Sector V, Salt Lake.

 TCG has diversified businesses real estate, IT and petrochemical but biotech is now considered the jewel in the crown for the group.

 TCG Lifesciences now employs about 570 people in Calcutta and 180 in Pune. 

 It also has operations in Mumbai and Delhi, employing 70 and 50 people respectively. Bhattacharya said he expected the headcount to grow significantly both in Calcutta and Pune. 

 By the second quarter of 2008, we are looking at a workforce of 1,000 in the city and about 700 in Pune, he added.

 In the future, the scale of operations may be higher in Pune than in the city because of the constraint of land here.

 Since TCG Lifesciences requires highly qualified professionals, it is unable to tap smaller towns in Bengal.

 TCG is developing a biotech park in Pune and TCG Lifesciences has picked up a 10-acre plot within the park. There is a possibility that this area may get a special economic zone status as well.

 The current phase of expansion to 100,000sqft will be ready by April next year. However, when fully developed, the Pune facility is expected to employ 3,500-4,000 scientists in three to five years. 

 The big push in biotechnology is coming at a time when India is angling for a significant portion of the global R amp;D outsourcing opportunity in the medium term.

 After the country shifted to product patent regime from process patent, a sizeable opportunity has opened up for Indian companies.

 We are building capabilities for full fledged drug discovery research on our own, he said. The company is gearing up for translational drug discovery approach the new frontier in global pharma R amp;D. There are three divisions within TCG Lifesciences Chembiotek, Clininvent and Labvantage. 

 TCG Lifesciences has entered into a pact with US-based Forest Laboratories for drug discovery to treat inflammatory diseases.

 Under the agreement, Chembiotek the chemistry and biology arm of the company will carry out research to identify and optimise lead molecules in collaboration with Forests scientists.

 Forest will have full ownership of the compounds developed under the collaboration with worldwide rights, and will fund all subsequent drug development and commercialisation activities. 

 Chembiotek will receive undisclosed discovery milestones from Forest.

 Calcutta, July 4: Phillips Carbon Black Ltd, the city-based RPG group company, will set up a plant in Vietnam.

 The largest domestic carbon black manufacturer today signed a memorandum of understanding with Vietnam National Chemical Corporation (Vinachem).

 The MoU was signed by Phillips Carbon chairman Sanjiv Goenka and Nguyen Ngoc Tuan, a board member of Vinachem, in the presence of Vietnam Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung.

 The Vietnamese Prime Minister was in the city today with a 105-member delegation to attend the India-Vietnam Business Forum organised by the CII.

 The unit, with a capacity of 50,000 tonnes, is expected to go on stream by 2009. It will require an investment of around Rs 250 crore.

 Phillips Carbon will have a controlling stake in the yet-to-be-formed company with Vinachem as the strategic partner.

 The expansion in our existing plants in India, coupled with the proposed unit in Vietnam, is expected to improve our global ranking, which is ninth at present, Goenka said.

 In two years, Phillips Carbon will have a capacity of 450,000 tonnes from the present level of 270,000 tonnes.

 It has plants in Durgapur in Bengal, Baroda in Gujarat and Kochi in Kerala. It is also setting up a plant at Mundra in Gujarat.

 Many tyre manufacturers are eyeing Vietnam because of an abundance of natural rubber in that country. Tyre makers are the main buyers of carbon black, making Vietnam an attractive destination for Phillips Carbon.

 Goenka said the companys equity investment in the Vietnam project would be under Rs 100 crore.

 Phillips Carbon was planning to tap the market later this year to raise capital to fund its expansion plans. 

 We hope to finalise the size and the nature of the issue by August, Goenka said.

 Bilateral ties

 India has become one of the largest investors in Vietnam, Dung said.

 He said the Vietnam economy was growing at a rate of 7-8 per cent in 2005-06 and was expected to cross 7 per cent during 2007-08. He urged the Indian government to take the relation between these two dynamic and potentially powerful nations to a new high.

 Earlier, Dung met Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 After the meeting, Bhattacharjee said the state has sought the help of Vietnam to develop pisciculture and dairy industry. A delegation from the CII and the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce would go there to explore opportunities, he said.

 Later, Dung left for Jamshedpur to visit the Tata Steel factory.

 He was accompanied by officials of Vietnam Steel Corporation, which has teamed up with Tata Steel to set up a greenfield plant there. 

 Essar is also building a steel plant in Vietnam.

 Tata Ryerson in Singur

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 27: Tata Ryerson will invest Rs 120 crore to make steel parts for the Singur small car project of Tata Motors.

 The company will set up its unit at the vendor park in Singur. The investment is the largest by a steel solutions company in Bengal. 

 Tata Ryerson is a 50:50 joint venture between Tata Steel and the US-based Ryerson Inc.

 We are going for the latest technology for the unit, Sandipan Chakravortty, managing director of Tata Ryerson, said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry here today.

 The company is in talks with the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation to sign a 90-year lease agreement for 10 acres.

 Tata Ryerson, which sells customised steel products to industries, is expected to meet 40 per cent of the steel requirement of each small car at Singur. Our facility will be ready in March 2008 in line with the rollout of the small car by Tata Motors, Chakravortty said.

 The company is also setting up two greenfield units at Pantnagar in Uttarakhand and at Chennai in Tamil Nadu to cater to the Ace and Caterpillar vehicles respectively of Tata Motors.

 The total investment in these two plants would be Rs 100 crore. In the next two years, our total production capacity would double to two million tonnes, making us Asias largest sheet metal products company, Chakravortty added.

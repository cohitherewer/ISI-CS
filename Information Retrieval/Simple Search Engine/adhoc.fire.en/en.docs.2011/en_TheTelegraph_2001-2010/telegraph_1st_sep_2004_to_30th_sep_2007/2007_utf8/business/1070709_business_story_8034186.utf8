 LOOSE CHANGE

 Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company has launched its gold exchange traded fund. Kotak Mutual Fund is the third fund house in the country to launch a gold ETF scheme. The investment objective of the scheme is to generate returns that are in line with the returns on investment in physical gold. The scheme will invest about 90 to 100 per cent of its corpus in physical gold and up to 10 per cent in debt and money market instruments. The new fund offer closes on July 4. 

 Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund has come up with a capital protection fund. The hybrid plan, which is basically a close-ended fund, offers two tenure options one is for three years and the second is for five years. In the three-year plan, it will invest up to 16 per cent of its corpus in equities and the remaining in debt and money market securities. The equity investment in the five-year plan will be a little higher at 23 per cent. The new fund offer closes on July 6.

 ING Mutual Fund has changed the names of its schemes following a change in its shareholding pattern. The word Vysya has been dropped from all existing fixed maturity plans. For example, ING Vysya Domestic Opportunities Fund will now be ING Domestic Opportunities Fund.

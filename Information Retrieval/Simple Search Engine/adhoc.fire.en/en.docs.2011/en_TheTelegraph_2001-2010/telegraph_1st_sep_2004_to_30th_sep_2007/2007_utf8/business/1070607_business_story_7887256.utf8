 Calcutta, June 6: Intel plans to launch mobile Internet devices in India next year.

 The company expects the global market for such devices to reach 180 million units by 2010.

 These are next generation mobile computing devices. They will bridge the gap between computers and mobile phones. The gadgets will connect to the Internet through a wireless link.

 Intel is piloting such devices in developed markets. The growth in the GSM and CDMA population of mobile subscribers and the need for mobile computing makes India a conducive market for such gadgets, said Amit Gupta, business lead manager, sales and marketing group South Asia, Intel.

 Intel is conducting an internal survey to assess the market for mobile Internet devices (MIDs) in India.

 The instruments can be carried elsewhere but they remain connected to the Internet constantly.

 The devices communicate through 3G (or third generation wireless) technology and can transmit information that include video, audio and graphics.

 They can also provide services such as email, chat, Internet browsing, instant messaging and video streaming. Intel terms any such instrument that fits into the pocket an MID.

 Mobile Internet devices are more compact versions of ultra-mobile personal computers, a euphemism for sleek and high-performing laptops.

 Intel MIDs will have a new processor, which is codenamed Silverthorne. 

 The processors are designed to work at one tenth the power needed for a laptop. Moreover, the processors cost 1,000 times less than a 286 processor.

 According to research firm IDC, 1.5 million laptops will be sold in India in 2007, a 57 per cent growth over the previous year, the highest in the world. The domestic laptop market grew 60 per cent in 2006, selling nine lakh units. 

 The growth of Intels business from notebooks was comparable with the industry growth rates.

 Laptop sales touched 195,000 units in the third quarter of 2006-07, recording a 54 per cent growth.

 IDC predicts that notebook sales will represent 50 per cent of the worldwide personal computer shipments in 2011.

 But according to reports, Intel expects the figure to be reached by 2009. It sees much of the growth coming from emerging markets such as India.

 The company is set to launch another processor technology, which has been code named Montevina. 

 It will be Intels first Centrino to offer the option of integrated Wi-FI and WiMax wireless technology for broadband access. 

 With components that are 40 per cent smaller than usual, Montevina is expected to be a precursor of next generation MIDs.

 At a developer forum in Beijing in April, Intel announced the formation of the Mobile Internet Device Innovation Alliance comprising design manufacturers such as Asus, BenQ, Compal, Elektrobit, HTC, Inventec, and Quanta. 

 Members of the alliance will work together to solve engineering challenges associated with delivering the Internet in MIDs, including power management, wireless communications and software integration.

 Mutual fund experts wary of NFO craze

 Mumbai, Aug. 2: New mutual funds are eating into the market for existing schemes .

 An analysis by Fidelity indicates redemptions from existing schemes may have been higher than sales, with growth brought about entirely by new funds. Sources said investors tended to forget returns from new funds were uncertain, which is not the case for old schemes.

 Ashu Suyash, managing director and country head, Fidelity Fund Management, said, In India, we see greater enthusiasm for new fund offers (NFOs), while several top performing funds do not even find a place in the investors consideration set. 

 No doubt, NFOs are necessary to broaden the market with new asset classes and innovative products, but we would advise investors to consider the long-term performance track record as one of the key parameters to look for while choosing a mutual fund. 

 Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research Online told The Telegraph that it was not healthy for investors to put money in equity funds only via NFOs. This shows the lack of education and guidance among the investors. This trend, if it continues, will drive the asset management companies to launch more and more new funds without changing the stock portfolio much. And eventually that will create a huge confusion among the investors. A majority of Indian investors are in an illusory world, and a certain degree of thoughtfulness is required while investing in equity mutual funds. 

 Kumar said investors should not invest in a mutual fund without analysing the track record of the fund. Investing in NFOs is not bad, but a thorough study of an existing funds past performance could fetch better returns. he pointed out. 

 Fidelity is re-launching its flagship Fidelity Equity Fund. The fund balances allocations across small-cap, mid-cap and large-cap stocks, and provides both growth and value style of investing. 

 The minimum investment in the fund is Rs 5,000. The entry load is 2.25 per cent, and an exit load of 1 per cent for redemptions within the first six months. 

 The Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) option is available with a minimum of six instalments of at least Rs 500 each, and totalling not less than Rs 5000.

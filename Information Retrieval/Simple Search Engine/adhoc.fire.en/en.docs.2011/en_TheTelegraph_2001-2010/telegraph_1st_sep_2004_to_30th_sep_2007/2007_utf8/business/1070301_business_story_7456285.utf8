The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 SECTOR SNAPSHOT 

 New Delhi: The India Tourism Development

 Corporation got a shot in the arm with Rs 146.35-crore

 allocation for its revival. Significantly, the state-owned

 public sector company, which has been battling for

 survival after the disinvestment blow, had received

 no budgetary support for past two fiscals. Recognising

 the tremendous

 scope of development of tourism through diverse attractions

 available in the Northeast, the region came under special

 focus with the finance minister proposing Rs 96 crore

 in the plan outlay. The minister also earmarked Rs

 96 crore in the tourism budget for projects and schemes

 benefitting the region.

 Mumbai: Domestic textile

 manufacturers were

 a happier lot when P. Chidambaram conceded a major

 demand pertaining to the technology upgradation fund

 scheme (TUFS). Even as the TUFS was extended for

 whole 

 of the Eleventh Plan period, Union Budget 2007-08

 also brought down the customs duties on polyester

 fibres 

 and yarns to 7.5 per cent from 10 per cent, a move

 that will bring down costs for the players. TUFS,

 a scheme, which offers 5 per cent interest subsidy

 on purchase of machinery, was set to expire on March

 31, 2007.

 New Delhi: The consumer electronics industry was left virtually untouched by finance minister P. Chidambaram and no immediate price cuts are in the offing. On the overall impact on prices of consumer electronics products, I see no relief coming to consumers from this budget, said Samsung Indias deputy managing director R. Zutshi. 

 New Delhi: The telecom sector barely got a mention in the budget speech, but companies may see a simplified tax structure soon. The department of telecom will constitute a committee to study the present structure of levies on the telecom industry to simplify the tax structure, Chidambaram said. 

 Calcutta: Excise duty on cigarettes was

 increased along the expected lines in the budget.

 Chidambaram also raised duty on bidi. He also did not

 offer any relief to pan masala containing tobacco.

 Chidambaram increased the specific rates of excise

 duty on cigarettes by about 5 per cent. 

 Calcutta: The budget seems to be a mixed bag for the tyre industry. The reduction of peak customs duty to 10 per cent from 12.5 per cent will further intensify competition in the industry. Cheap imports, especially from China, may flood the market to a greater extent. P. K. Ruia, chairman of Dunlop and Falcon Tyres, said it could prove to be difficult times for the Indian tyre industry.

 New Delhi: Chidambaram has proposed a 2 per cent reduction in customs duty on cut and polished diamonds to 3 per cent. He said an assessment procedure would be in place for diamond manufacturers and traders whose profits are 8 per cent or more of their turnover.

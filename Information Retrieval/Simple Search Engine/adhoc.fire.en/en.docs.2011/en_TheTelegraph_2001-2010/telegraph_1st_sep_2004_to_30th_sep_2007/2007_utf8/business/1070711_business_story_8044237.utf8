 Calcutta, July 10: Corporation Bank is setting up a payment facility through mobile phones for its customers.

 Such a system will eat into the market for credit cards, said B. Sambamurthy, chairman and managing director of the bank. 

 We are talking to some software development companies for this service. The service will initially be offered on a trial basis in Delhi. It will then be extended to other parts of the country, Sambamurthy said on the sidelines of a banking conclave organised by the eastern regional council of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

 e-commerce did not take off in our country despite much hype because the penetration of personal computers and Internet/broadband connectivity was low. While a little more than 20 million people in our country own a computer and a million have broadband connectivity, more than 200 million own a mobile phone. The tremendous growth in mobile telephony has a huge potential for the mobile payment system, Sambamurthy added.

 The mobile payment system allows consumers to use their devices like a wallet with cash and credit card facility. It also has built-in bank account functions. 

 Mobile payments are not only more secure than credit or debit card payments but the cost of transaction is also lower. The cost of transaction in mobile payment can be as low as 40 paise, Sambamurthy said. Meanwhile, ICICI Bank, in a tieup with AirTel, is offering a mobile-to-mobile payment service called m-check in Delhi. The private sector bank is also planning such a project in Mumbai.

 Tata Indicom plans to set up a system called Tata IndiPay. Financial Technologies, the promoter of the Multi-Commodity Exchange, is developing a low-cost software for mobile payment.

 Last year, Coruscant Tec promoters launched a payment solution called PayMate. Only Citibank customers can use this system. A customer needs to register with the bank for this service, after which one will receive an SMS with an MPIN. The customer can change the PIN to any number he/she can easily remember.

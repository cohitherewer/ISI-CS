 Dhoot starts at the roots

 Dhoot: Core issue

 New Delhi, Jan. 16: Industry chamber Assocham is setting up a special task force, which will identify key sectors that can play a major role in achieving a 10 per cent sustainable growth over the next 10 years, Venugopal Dhoot, chairman of the Videocon group and president-elect of Assocham, said.

 In the next 10 days, we will form a special task force, which will be headed by an eminent industry expert. The chamber will submit its report to the government in the next three months. The idea is to deal with issues at the root level... this is my vision for the year, said Dhoot in an interview with The Telegraph, a day before he took over as Assocham chief.

 Reacting to finance minister P. Chidambarams recent comment that a certain section of industry is responsible for artificially pushing up prices, he said, Growth and inflation travel on the same boat. There can be no growth without high inflation. However, we do agree that a check and balance system must exist to maintain order in society.

 While it is surprising that inflation has continued to rise despite a fall in global oil prices, it is important to remember that the effect will only be visible after few months, he said.

 Dhoot, who is shifting to New Delhi to concentrate adequately on chamber activities, advocated tax exemptions for certain sections of industry.

 He was responding to apprehensions voiced by industry representatives after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said tax exemptions are likely to be done away with. 

 Sectors like pharmaceuticals and information technology, which have been the main performers, or segments that need to undertake research and development should be given tax benefits. That will help us be globally competitive, he said. 

 The government is the guardian of industry, (and) giving certain benefits (tax) is its responsibility, he added.

 Touching on the issue of job reservation in the private sector, Dhoot said industry was already working on an affirmative action plan and was against any imposition of quota for the underprivileged strata of society.

 Industry has agreed to abide by what it has promised. We have asked the government to see our efforts for a year, which will get reflected in our balance sheets and then take a final stand, said Dhoot.

 Patent pact acts as tonic for Ranbaxy

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 26: Ranbaxy Laboratories today reached an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to settle a patent row over anti-viral drug Valtrex.

 Under the agreement, Ranbaxy will enter the US market in late 2009 and will enjoy 180 days of exclusive rights to sell the drug used to treat herpes infections.

 The patent agreement propelled Ranbaxy shares on stock markets and the scrip closed 9.5 per cent higher on the BSE at Rs 373.4 after rising 10.1 per cent during trade. It was the drug companys biggest single-day gain in over a year.

 The two companies were at loggerheads over GSKs patent on the drug, which covered the generic valacyclovir hydrochloride tablets, the active ingredient of Valtrex.

 Ranbaxy had received the USFDAs approval in February this year to market and manufacture valacyclovir hydrochloride tablets.

 The settlement will give Ranbaxy a headstart in the $1.3-billion market for the drug in the US. 

 Ranbaxy said it was the first company to challenge 20 patents in the US, including those of Pfizer Inc. The company expects to win similar marketing rights for copies of original drugs worth about $26 billion before other generic companies enter and pull down prices.

 Market exclusivity, given to a drug maker that is the first to file a challenge to a US patent, gives lucrative margins to the generics firm and has boosted the earnings of companies such as Ranbaxy and Dr Reddys Laboratories. 

 In the past six years, Ranbaxy has won rights for six drugs, ranging from anti-virals to cholesterol treatment. 

 Im certainly open to settlement as a way forward. We need to identify ways to monetise these opportunities, company chief executive Malvinder Singh said. 

 He also said the company was confident it would exceed its outlook for 20 per cent revenue growth in 2007. This year, clearly we are exceeding that guidance, he said.

 Singh said he was not perturbed by a Spanish courts ruling on Wednesday that upheld Pfizer Incs patent covering an active ingredient in its cholesterol-fighter, Lipitor.

 Thats a very small basic thing, he said.

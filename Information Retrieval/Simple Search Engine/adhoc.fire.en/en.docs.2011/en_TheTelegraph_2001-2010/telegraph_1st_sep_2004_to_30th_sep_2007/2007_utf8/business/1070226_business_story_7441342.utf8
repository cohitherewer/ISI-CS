 Anxious wait

 Srikumar Bondyopadhyay guides you through various tax-saving instruments before the budget

 It is that time of the year when personal taxes come under the scanner. However, the changes that finance minister P. Chidambaram plans to propose in this years budget are anybodys guess.

 Over the past few years, tax planning has become easier with sectoral investment caps being removed for tax saving instruments. A taxpayer can now avail of a maximum deduction of Rs 1 lakh by investing in specified tax-saving instruments under section 80C.

 Attractive instruments like equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS) of mutual funds, unit-linked life insurance and pension plans and specified bank fixed deposits have been included in this section.

 These took the shine away from traditional instruments, such as infrastructure bonds, conventional life insurance plans, National Savings Certificate and RBI bonds, and have opened up a new vista for taxpayers to earn a significantly higher return.

 Bank deposits shine

 Banks, such as Allahabad Bank and ICICI Bank, recently started offering 9 per cent and higher rates of interest on their tax saving fixed deposits.

 This is higher than the 8 per cent interest investors get in NSC or PPF. Besides, the interest in a bank fixed deposit is compounded quarterly unlike half-yearly in NSC or annually in PPF. As a result, the return on investment finally works out significantly higher in bank fixed deposits than in NSC or PPF (see table). Bank deposits are also more attractive because of a lower maturity period than in NSC or PPF.

 Equity-linked gains

 While risk-averse investors found greener pastures in bank fixed deposits, risk-takers had a field day with equity-linked tax saving instruments of mutual funds, life insurance and pension schemes. These instruments witnessed tremendous growth in the last couple of years.

 According to the latest data available with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda), 49.77 per cent (Rs 24,311.10 crore) of the business underwritten by life insurance companies between April and December last year was in the unit-linked category. A further segregation of the data reveals that while Life Insurance Corporation, the traditional bastion for taxpayers, recorded 39.49 per cent of its business from unit-linked policies, the percentage was as high as 78.86 per cent for private life insurers taken together.

 Pension relief

 After lifting the tax deduction limit on premium payment towards pension plans to Rs 1 lakh in the last budget from Rs 10,000, sales of pension products by life insurance companies have also picked up. According to the Irda data, annuity, pension and health insurance product contributed about 66 per cent (Rs 32,136.85 crore) of total premium underwritten by insurers between April and December 2006.

 Meanwhile, a 32.78 per cent decline in gross collection across the country by post offices during the first six months of the current financial year indicates that taxpayers are increasingly shifting away from traditional instruments like NSC and PPF to more rewarding avenues like bank fixed deposits, ELSS and unit-linked life insurance and pension plans.

 More deductions

 However, investing in tax saving instruments is only one aspect of the overall tax and financial planning. There are other deductions available under different sections of the Income Tax Act (see chart). 

 Premium paid for medical insurance (deduction up to Rs 10,000 under section 80D) and repayment of interest on housing loan (deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 24), for example, allow one to claim additional deduction over and above Rs 1 lakh allowed under section 80C.

 Similarly, section 80E allows one to claim deduction on interest payment towards an education loan taken for a full-time course. Not many people claim the deduction available under this section.

 Other avenues

 One must also carefully select investments in non-tax saving instruments because the implication of income tax on the capital gains or loss in those assets could have a significant bearing on your overall tax liability.

 For example, if you invest in stocks or diversified equity schemes of mutual funds, you will have to pay a tax at the rate of 10 per cent only on any short-term gains arising out of sales of those shares or units within a year of purchase. But in case of other assets, the short-term capital gains tax will be calculated at the marginal rate of the tax bracket you are in. 

 The difference is wider in case of long-term capital gains tax. There is no long-term capital gains tax for equity or equity-related investments, but it is 20 per cent for other asset classes.

 Again, investments in house property get special tax treatment vis--vis other assets. On a housing loan, principal repayment up to Rs 1 lakh in a year is allowed for deduction under section 80C and interest payment up to Rs 1.5 lakh a year is allowed for deduction under section 24. Moreover, capital gains tax on the sale of a house is waived under section 54 if the proceeds are reinvested in another house by way of construction within three years or purchase a built-up house within a year. 

 However, if the house was bought for investment purpose only and not for residing, you would have to reinvest the money like in case of any other assets in capital gains bonds of the National Highway Authority of India or Rural Electrification Corporation within six months.

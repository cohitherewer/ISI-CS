 BSNL tender report today

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Hard times 

 New Delhi, July 16: The board of state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) today met to take a decision on the 45.5-million GSM tender and will hand over a report to the government tomorrow.

 After taking into consideration all the observations and suggestions made by the telecom ministry, we have taken a decision which will work in the interest of BSNL. Tomorrow, we will send our suggestions to the government, chairman A.K. Sinha said.

 With the PSU reeling under a capacity crunch, sources said BSNL was likely to drop the 3G component from the tender and limit the scope of the contract to only 2G lines and thereby bring down the price to under $90 per line. 

 This would be in the interest of all parties and would assist in a quick finalisation of the GSM deal, sources said.

 BSNL could also propose to call a financial re-bid among the shortlisted vendors, without cancelling the existing tender, the legal complications of which have been discussed during the meeting, sources said. However, they added that the PSU was unlikely to call for a fresh tender. 

 Earlier this week, employees of BSNL went on a day-long strike to protest the delay in finalising the deal, which they said was vital for the companys future. 

 Telecom minister A. Raja had suggested that 3G services should be removed from the tender for the time being and BSNL should focus on 2G or normal voice services. 

 Another key query of the minister was related to the earlier board decision of selecting Swedish vendor Ericsson at a higher price of $107 a line and not considering Motorola, which has supplied 2G GSM lines at a price of $69 to other service providers. 

 Motorola was disqualified by BSNLs tender evaluation committee on the ground that it was not capable of delivering 3G equipment. 

 We dwelt on all the options and have prepared our report. The decision now lies with the minister, said Sinha, but he declined to give any further details. 

 BSNL says it needs to place the expansion order immediately as the capacity of its networks are on the verge of saturation and is affecting its position.

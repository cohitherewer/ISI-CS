 Stocks go into a tailspin

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 1: The sensex crashed by 615 points today the third largest fall in its history following a global selloff triggered by fears of a meltdown in a US loan market.

 Around Rs 181,000 crore of investor wealth got wiped off in just five-and-a-half hours of trading today, with the sensex sliding below 15000 to 14935.77, a loss of 3.96 per cent.

 At the heart of the turmoil is the US sub-prime mortgage market, which has been wracked by defaults, forcing many funds to run for cover. 

 Sub-prime loans or mortgages are given to borrowers who have a poor record in debt payments. 

 They are risky because of high interest rates and the bad credit history of borrowers.

 Shares on the BSE tumbled across the board today, mirroring the trend in Europe and Asia. 

 The Morgan Stanley Capital International Asia Pacific Index fell 2.6 per cent to 151.90 in Tokyo, while South Koreas Kospi plunged 4.8 per cent, the most since May 17, 2004. Japans Nikkei 225 stock average was down to 16870.98. 

 In Hong Kong, share prices closed 3.15 per cent lower. The Hang Seng index closed down 729.58 points at 22,455.36.

 The red signal was flashed yesterday when the Dow Jones index of the New York Stock Exchange fell by 1 per cent over sub-prime loan concerns.

 Fears over certain funds with exposure to the sub-prime market pulling out from other regions to cover up their losses provoked a selloff in Asia and Europe.

 Nearly all the Asian markets wallowed in a sea of red, as key indices crashed between 2 per cent and 4 per cent.

 Latest reports indicate that even entities outside the US are in trouble because of their exposure to the sub-prime mortgage segment. 

 Seshadri Bharathan, director stock broking, Dawnay Day AV Securities Pvt Ltd, said, Indian markets collapsed today mainly because of the sub-prime market crash after a US mortgage lender said it had no cash to pay its creditors.

 He said Australias Macquarie Bank warned that two of its investment funds could lose up to 25 per cent, or $300 million, because of the sub-prime meltdown.

 In another instance, Bear Stearns, manager of two hedge funds that collapsed last month, blocked investors from pulling money out of a third fund, sending futures on US share indexes lower.

 According to V.K. Sharma, head of research at Anagram Stock Broking, as hedge funds stare at heavy losses in the US, they are selling elsewhere. 

 The sensex opened lower at 15344.02 and came under consistent pressure. 

 The feeble attempts at recovery were brushed aside by strong selling, even among heavyweights. The index touched the intra-day low of 14910.52 before closing at 14935.77,a net loss of 3.96 per cent from yesterdays close of 15550.99. 

 On May 18, 2006, the sensex suffered its biggest loss of 826.38 points followed by a loss of 616.73 points on April 2,2007.

 Brokers said the selling tide was so furious that even heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, the State Bank of India and many others ended deep in the red despite posting good quarterly results. 

 Reliance plunged by Rs 94.30 to Rs 1,798.00, Bharti by Rs 40.50 to Rs 862.95 and the SBI by Rs 76.25 to Rs 1,548.25. 

 Others such as ONGC, ICICI Bank, Tata Steel and Infosys also took a hammering. 

 Analysts said stocks of companies were increasingly falling prey to adverse overseas trends despite the companies posting good quarterly results and possessing strong fundamentals.

 The immediate future depends on the outcome of the global market which is beyond anybodys control .One must adopt absolute caution and should stay on the sidelines for things to get clear, says Ashu Madan, national head - retail equity, Religare Enterprises Ltd.

 Madan feels the stock markets should brace for more shocks from the sub-prime crisis. However, Lalit Thakkar, director, research, Angel Broking said some markets were strong enough not to be affected by the sub-prime meltdown.

 I dont think that all emerging markets will come down on a collective basis. We could see divergence as robust earnings of companies could see some markets changing course, he told The Telegraph.

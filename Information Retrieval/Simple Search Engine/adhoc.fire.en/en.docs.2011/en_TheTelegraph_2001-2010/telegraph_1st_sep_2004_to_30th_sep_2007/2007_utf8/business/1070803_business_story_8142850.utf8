 Steel czars vie for SEZ trophy

 Roongta: Big plans

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: Steel Authority of India Limited and Tata Steel have extended their rivalry to the sphere of special economic zones (SEZs).

 The two are vying to become the first company to set up a metal-based SEZ in the country. SAIL will soon bring a proposal for the SEZ on a spare land owned by Salem Steel Plant before the Centre and the Tamil Nadu government. Salem Steel is a division of SAIL. 

 We plan to set up the metal-based SEZ in Salem soon. It will add value and bring jobs to that area, said S. K. Roongta, chairman of SAIL. 

 While SAIL is in a hurry to get its proposal cleared by statutory authorities, the Tatas are trying to quickly acquire small parcels of land for its SEZ at Gopalpur in Orissa. 

 Till now the only notified metal-based SEZ is a Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation project in Aurangabad.

 This is for aluminium-related industries, and the size of 200 acres is much smaller than what has been envisaged by SAIL and Tata Steel.

 The Tatas, who have obtained the permission to set up the SEZ at Gopalpur, are now trying to acquire about 150-180 acres across small pockets within the 3,200-acre zone.

 Ashok Meena, chairman of the Orissa Industrial Development Corporation, told The Telegraph, The Tatas have got formal clearance for the SEZ and now have six months to complete their land acquisition and show us their land rights. 

 Sources said Tata Steel was trying to complete the acquisition of the small pieces of land as fast as possible to meet the deadline. The Gopalpur SEZ, to house plants using not only steel but also aluminium and chromium, will have a port capable of handling up to 240,000 tonnes of cargo.

 SAIL does not have a problem of land. It has about 1,000 acres of spare land after completing a Rs 1,500-crore expansion of Salem Steel Plant.

 In Salem, as in Gopalpur, units will use non-steel metals, though a majority of them will use steel. This district in Tamil Nadu is also rich in magnesite, bauxite and granite that could be used as inputs in the SEZ.

 However, the main focus will be on downstream stainless steel and special steel industries.

 British firm to invest in KG basin

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 2: British energy company BG Group Plc and ONGC plan to invest about $1 billion in the Krishna-Godavari basin oil and gas block, which they won in the just concluded auction.

 Our investment over the next five years could be about $1 billion, BG India managing director William Adamson said after signing the production sharing contract.

 BG has a 45 per cent interest in the block, while ONGC holds 55 per cent interest and operatorship in the 1,150-sq-km shallow water block.

 This award adds to our portfolio of upstream assets and marks the beginning of BG Indias diversification into a new and growing hydrocarbon region on the east coast, he said.

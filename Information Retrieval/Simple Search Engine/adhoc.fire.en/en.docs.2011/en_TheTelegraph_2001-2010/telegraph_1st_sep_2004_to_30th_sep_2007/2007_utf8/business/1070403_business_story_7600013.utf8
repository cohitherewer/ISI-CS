 Starwood Hotels chief executive quits

 Checking out

 New York, April 2 (Reuters): Starwood Hotels amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc, parent of the St Regis, Westin and Sheraton chains, said on Monday that chief executive Steven Heyer has resigned after losing the boards confidence.

 While the board appreciates the good work Steve Heyer has done to position Starwood for the future, issues regarding his management style have led us to lose confidence in his leadership, said Stephen Quazzo, chairman of the governance and nominating committee.

 Chairman Bruce Duncan will be interim CEO while the board searches for a permanent replacement.

 The hotel operators stock has fallen almost 7 per cent from a nearly 19-year high of $69.65 reached on February 15. 

 It closed at $64.85 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.

 Starwood is performing extremely well, and I am confident it will enjoy continued success in the future, Heyer said in a statement.

 The company wasnt immediately available to comment further.

 Starwood forecast strong profit and revenues for the current quarter and for full-year 2007 when it announced results at the beginning of February, beating Wall Streets expectations.

 The company reaffirmed its full-year and first-quarter earnings targets on Monday. On February 1, the company forecast earnings before special items of 38 cents per share for the first quarter and $2.50 per share for the full year.

 Analysts, on average, expect Starwood to post earnings of 39 cents a share in the first quarter and $2.52 a share in 2007, according to Reuters Estimates.

 The board is confident about Starwoods prospects and focused on continuing to build shareholder value, Duncan said in a statement.

 The White Plains, New York-based company, along with most of the US lodging industry, has been enjoying strong travel demand and limited growth in the supply of rooms, allowing for steady increases in rates.

 It has also been selling hotels and retaining management contracts as well as franchising its brands a strategy that helps free up cash.

 New Delhi, June 13: The launch of third generation (3G) mobile services will be delayed as the defence and the telecom ministries are at loggerheads over transfer of spectrum.

 Spectrum are radio frequencies that enable wireless communication. The defence forces are supposed to vacate spectrum for telecom operators to roll out 3G services. However, todays meeting of the group of ministers set up to prepare a road map for the transfer had to be postponed.

 There were no official reasons for the postponement, but sources believed the differences among the various ministries would have ensured that the GoM did not reach any solution. 

 3G services are high-end mobile value added services such as real-time transactions, video streaming, voice and data services. Telecom firms can generate a lot of revenue from these services. The industry is confident that the telecom department will come up with a solution soon. 

 The department of telecom (DoT) is well aware of the importance of finalising the 3G spectrum policy and we are confident that a solution will emerge soon, said Dilip Modi, vice-chairman and president of MCorpGlobal the Indian promoter of Spice Telecom.

 The release of spectrum for telecom companies is crucial to finalising the 3G policy. Suggestions of the GoM would also have been incorporated in the spectrum allocation and pricing plan. 

 Another hurdle delaying the vacation of 3G spectrum is the difference between the defence ministry and DoT over the cost of setting up an alternate communication network. 

 According to the defence ministrys communication to the DoT, the total cost of shift the communication network from a wireless platform to an optic fibre one will be Rs 3,000 crore more in addition to the Rs 980 crore allocated last year.

 In the interest of national security, the armed forces must get alternative networks and full connectivity before it can vacate spectrum for allocation to mobile service providers, said defence ministry officials.

 While GSM operators have demanded an additional 13.2 MHz of spectrum in the 2.5 Ghz band, the two main CDMA service providers Reliance and Tata have asked for additional 5 MHz in the 800 MHz band.

 Sahara staff apprehensive

 BIDDING ADIEU

 Mumbai, April 12: For most employees of Air Sahara, the bidaai from Sahara Parivar is hurting the head as well as the heart.

 Aviation industry may be desperate for trained professionals, but we are not sure about the conditions that Jet Airways will put on us. True, Air Sahara was in the red, but we were paid better than market rates. As professionals, we see the snapping of ties with Sahara as an amputation that is life saving, but heart wrenching as well, says a commander with the merged airline.

 But the biggest surprise was the lack of solidarity among employees.

 Pilots, who had taken a collective stand about their careers after the merger announcement in January 2006, were markedly individualistic in their reactions to Thursdays deal.

 I have a few offers. I will see what Jet offers and then take a call. And with the present crunch for pilots in the industry, finding another job wont be tough. It sure would be impossible to find employers like Sahara, said a pilot who had left Indian Airlines to join Air Sahara when it was launched.

 Many of his younger colleagues have moved on to other airlines like Kingfisher and SpiceJet. The work environment in other airlines, including Jet, is stressful with inhuman flying schedules and rosters. At Air Sahara, things are very comfortable, he says.

 Though financially weakened since its heydays, the Sahara Group is known to be a thoughtful employer. And thats what most employees said they would miss.

 Its like leaving home for the first time to step into the unknown world, said Roshni, a ground-staff member of Air Sahara.

 A new policy of the ministry of civil aviation bars domestic carriers from self handling ground-service operations and makes Roshni and her colleagues a bit redundant for Jet. 

 A top source in Jet Airways confirmed that though the airline has announced it will retain all the 3,700 Air Sahara employees, Some will be more equal than the others. 

 Jet will retain all pilots, and engineers, while the marketing staff will stay with Sahara. As for cabin crew and ground staff, nobodys jobs will be terminated, but they may not get the jobs they want, he said.

 Going by the mood, it seems employee integration may be the toughest part of Indias first aviation merger.

 Sebi terms for hedge fund direct entry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Damodaran: Safe plan

 Mumbai, March 28: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is open to the idea of allowing hedge funds to invest directly in the domestic stock markets but this route will be thrown open to them only after the market regulator is satisfied about the credentials of the particular fund, Sebi chairman M. Damodaran said here today.

 Hedge funds now invest in the stock markets by subscribing to participatory notes (PNs), which are offshore derivative instruments issued by foreign institutional investors (FIIs). The PN derives its value from the underlying stock investments made by the FII.

 Neither the finance ministry nor the market regulator has been comfortable with the indirect investment by hedge funds since the quick entry and exit options that the PNs afford tend to make the market volatile.

 The Sebi chief has in the past indicated that he was in favour of hedge funds investing directly here instead of going through the PN route and that these funds could also register with the market regulator. It is estimated that close to 30 per cent of the FII money invested in Indian capital markets come from hedge funds.

 Damodaran told reporters here that hedge funds would be granted registrations after the market regulator looked into the merits of each case. If the Indian story is good, our preference is that the investors must invest in their own name ... We will go through all the applications that come to us, he said. 

 The Sebi chief added that as part of its comfort drive, it could also correspond with other regulators to learn more about the particular investor.

 Last week, Sebi had made it mandatory for initial public offerings (IPOs) to seek grading from credit rating agencies. Although the decision has been welcomed by many investors, it has been criticised by a few others. 

 Responding to one such criticism that such a grading would not be complete if it does not take into account the issue price, Damodaran said the present structure of rating the IPO on the basis of company fundamentals will continue.

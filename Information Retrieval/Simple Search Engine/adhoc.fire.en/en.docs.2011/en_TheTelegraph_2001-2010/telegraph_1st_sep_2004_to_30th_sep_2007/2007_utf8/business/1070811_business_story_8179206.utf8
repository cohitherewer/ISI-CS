 Tata Tea stirs growth potion

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 10: Tata Tea will look at the US market to acquire beverage companies. 

 The future is exciting for the company. We are a global company. We want to be an integrated beverage player in the wellness segment, said chairman Ratan Tata.

 It will also consider restructuring by consolidating its beverage business at an appropriate time.

 We want to amalgamate different elements into a single entity in the future. But there are certain tax and liability implications, Tata said.

 Companies such as Starbucks are going great guns with their retail model. Tata Tea will also consider adopting such a successful model, Tata added.

 The company will also consider a stock split in future.

 As reported in The Telegraph, Tata Tea is looking at a joint venture partner in Russia for tea and coffee. The venture is likely to be in place in the next six to seven months.

 Russia and CIS countries will be key destinations for the company in the future. If we are successful in Russia, we will look at China, said R.K. Krishnakumar, vice-chairman of Tata Tea.

 China will drive the companys foray into next generation wellness products with its joint venture in green tea extracts producing polyphenols.

 Tata Teas global beverage market share is a little over 4 per cent, while the market leaders share is 15 per cent.

 April date for coal price rise 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Rao: Rate rejig

 Calcutta, Jan. 11: Come April, coal prices may go up. 

 It has been decided that Coal India Ltd will move to gross calorific value (GCV)-based coal pricing from the present useful heat value (UHV) method by April 1, coal minister Dasari Narayana Rao said here today after a two-day meeting with officials of Coal India and its subsidiaries. It has also been decided that Coal India will supply only washed coal to its customers other than pit-head power plants. Coal India will soon come out with a timeframe and a detailed plan to implement the decision, the minister added.

 While washed coal will cost more because of the additional expenses at washeries, the proposed pricing method may also increase the commodity price. Coal India officials, however, denied this. 

 As of now, locally produced non-coking coal is graded according to the UHV method, which is determined by the moisture and ash content of coal. 

 The calorific value of coal is the heat released from its complete combustion with oxygen. Gross calorific value is mostly determined by experimental measurements and hence the relationship between useful heat value and gross calorific value is only empirical.

 RBI to share price data with public

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 16: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to soon make public its inflation expectation surveys, RBI governor Y.V. Reddy and deputy governor Rakesh Mohan said today. The surveys are now done internally.

 They did not, however, divulge any timeframe or provide further details. Sources said the RBI was now conducting such surveys for every quarter and this would precede its quarterly review of the monetary policy. 

 In doing the survey, the RBI takes into account the views of households, working people, professionals and financial markets. 

 Among the factors that influence inflation are the peoples expectation about price rise. Central banks in the developed world routinely conduct such surveys to gauge the sentiments of people.

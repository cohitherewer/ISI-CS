 Suzlon in German takeover battle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Tanti: Ready for a fight

 Mumbai, Feb. 9: After the war between Tata Steel and Brazils CSN for Corus, another Indian company is involved in a takeover slugfest.

 Suzlon Energy has locked horns with Areva for the control of REpower, a German wind turbine manufacturer. Suzlon has made a counter offer of 1.02 billion euros to acquire REpower.

 Suzlon improved upon a public tender offer made by Areva for the German company. It has made a cash offer of 126 euros per share to shareholders of REpower. This represents a premium of 20 per cent over that offered by Areva.

 The price is also higher than any historic share price of REpower. It is more than 76 per cent of the average volume weighted share price of REpower over the last three months prior to the announced offer by Areva. 

 Areva, a multinational company, provides solutions in the power sector.

 Suzlon today said it would be supported by Portuguese company Martifer in making the friendly tender offer for the company that is based in Hamburg.

 Both Martifer and Areva are major shareholders of REpower. Martifer currently holds a 25.4 per cent stake, while Areva owns 29.9 per cent.

 The company added that Martifer has a joint venture with REpower in Portugal. Suzlon and Martifer have signed a legally binding agreement, which has set out the terms for the offer. 

 The offer will be made through a BidCo, in which Suzlon holds 75 per cent and Martifer 25 per cent of the capital. Part of the agreement is that Suzlon will finance the offer and Martifer will support it. Yes Bank and ABN AMRO are joint financial advisers of Suzlon.

 Commenting on the proposed acquisition, Tulsi R. Tanti, chairman and managing director of Suzlon Energy, said, A combination of Suzlon and REpower would be uniquely positioned to establish sustainable global market leadership in the wind energy industry due to best-in-class products, outstanding R amp;D capabilities and an integrated supply chain. It is our goal to establish a top three position in Asia, the Americas and Europe.

 He added that joining forces with REpower will lead to a compelling value-enhancing proposition wherein two highly complementary brands, competencies and market positions will be brought together.

 We believe the business models of REpower and Suzlon to be highly complementary. Such a combination will create significant value for all stakeholders, he said.

 Andre Horbach, CEO of Amsterdam-based Suzlon Group, said that if Suzlon is successful in its attempt to takeover REpower, a consistent dual branded strategy will be followed with a view to preserve the identity of both REpower and Suzlon brands. 

 Further Hamburg will continue to remain the headquarters of REpower, and Germany will be developed as Suzlons worldwide headquarters for R amp;D.

 Dispelling fears of any job losses, the Suzlon management said it had precise plans to create new jobs. With the new combination, Suzlon intends to create 100 to 200 highly-qualified positions in R amp;D in Germany by the end of 2009. REpower currently employs 740 staff.

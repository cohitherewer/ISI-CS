 Tech units keen on SEZs in state

 JAYATI GHOSE

 New Delhi, July 22: Domestic PC manufacturers are spending huge money to set up special economic zones on IT in Bengal.

 RP Infosystems, makers of Chirag personal computers, is investing Rs 1,000 crore on an SEZ in the state.

 The company has bought 41 acres of land. It proposes to set up an IT special economic zone which will manufacture motherboards and RAMs for Chirag desktops and laptops, Kaustuv Ray, chairman of RP Infosystems, told The Telegraph.

 RP Infosystems has sought government approval and is in talks with a Chinese IT firm to set up the unit. 

 We expect the SEZ to start operations by the second quarter of 2008, said Ray, adding that civil construction on the site was underway.

 The company manufactures keyboards, mouse and monitors in its plants at Howrah, Parwanoo and Shillong.

 The Xenitis group is also in the race to get an SEZ status for its plant at Sugandha in Hooghly, Bengal. The Rs 530-crore group has tied up with Chinas Unitek Company for its computer component manufacturing factory at Hoogly. 

 The plant has already been given an in-principle approval by the government. The company now awaits full SEZ status so that it can attract other hardware manufacturers to the state. Xenitis chairman Santanu Ghosh said, The SEZ status will go a long way in providing a fillip to IT investment in the state.

 The unit, spread over 140,000sqft, will manufacture computer cases and power supply units to be sold to original equipment manufacturers.

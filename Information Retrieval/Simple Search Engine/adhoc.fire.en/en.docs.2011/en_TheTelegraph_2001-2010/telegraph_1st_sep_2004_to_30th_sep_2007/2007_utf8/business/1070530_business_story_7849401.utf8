 Cash prop for farms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Singh: Helping hand

 New Delhi, May 29: The Centre today said it would invest Rs 25,000 crore over a four-year period in the agriculture sector.

 A higher farm output will help check the inflation rate, which is more than 5 per cent now.

 At a meeting of the National Development Council, it was decided to spread the Green Revolution to eastern India and bring more land under irrigation. The meeting was attended by the Prime Minister, Union cabinet ministers and chief ministers.

 To enhance food security, the target for wheat in the next four years has been raised by 8 million tonnes, for rice by 10mt and pulses by 2mt.

 However, suggestions for contract farming and land share companies did not find favour at the meeting today. Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee rejected both the proposals.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said a vibrant farm sector was needed for a more inclusive growth.

 Reversing the prolonged slowdown in this sector is essential for inclusive growth, for ensuring that growth benefits all sections of society and all regions of the country, Singh said. 

 The Prime Minister also pitched for direct fertiliser subsidies to farmers. 

 We must reflect whether subsidies, though necessary, are being delivered in the best possible manner, he said.

 The rates of growth of agriculture in the last decade have been poor and are a major cause of rural distress, he told the NDC.

 BSNL employees call off strike

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 11: Employees of state-run BSNL went on a one-day strike to protest the delay in awarding contracts for expansion of its mobile network, but decided not to continue the stir after the government assured them that the companys interests would be protected.

 The strike was a complete success and workers of all the unions were off work, V.A.N. Namboodri, convener of the joint forum of BSNL and MTNL employees, said here. The strike of BSNL employees will end at midnight tonight, he added.

 The employees went on strike to protest the delay in awarding contracts for laying 45.5 million GSM lines to the selected vendors Ericsson and Nokia. BSNL had selected the two companies for expanding its mobile network, but disqualified US equipment supplier Motorola, which dragged the public sector firm to court. Motorola later dropped the case, but BSNL is yet to award the contract to the vendors.

 CPI-M leader Sitaram Yechury has also joined in the effort to help BSNL regain its position. In a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, he said: BSNL is today facing an extremely critical situation and appears to have reached a point of complete saturation in the mobile telephony sector. BSNL is facing a capacity crunch because of a delay in the placement of the 45.5-million GSM line expansion contracts. In this interim period, private operators have expanded their customer base and increased their market share, pushing BSNL to the third position from the earlier second in the GSM segment.

 Moreover, in terms of combined GSM and CDMA growth, BSNL is in the fourth position after Bharti Airtel, Reliance Communications and Hutch Essar, he added.

 He has asked the government to protect and strengthen the company. Public sector units cannot be deliberately allowed to degenerate while helping the private sector grow.

 BSNL usually adds around 15-20 lakh subscribers a month. In the last three months, there have been no additions. The company has already lost Rs 110 crore in revenues because of the delay in procuring equipment, Namboodri said. We have told both the secretary and the CMD that the purchase order has to be issued at any cost so that we can stop subscribers from leaving, he added. 

 Telecom minister A. Raja today appealed to the employees to end their stir. He assured them that the interest of BSNL and its employees would be protected.

 The staff union today sought a written assurance from the DoT on its demand that the contract for laying 45.5 million GSM lines would be placed to the selected vendors and that BSNL would not drop the 3G component from the contract. The statement said telecom secretary D.S. Mathur had given a written assurance that serious efforts would be made so that BSNL remained in full readiness to utilise the benefits of technological evolution in 2G/3G/wimax. 

 Raja had earlier questioned the decision to reject Motorola and had suggested that the 3G segment in the tender be dropped. He had said BSNL should initiate a financial re-bidding within a month with all five bidders Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia, Siemens and ZTE and finalise fresh technical specifications for the tender.

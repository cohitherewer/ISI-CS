 Sensex roars back to life

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, Feb. 15: Undettered by concerns over a rising inflation, which hit a new two-year high, and steeper interest rates, stocks surged today, backed by strong Asian markets. A broad-based rally led by infotech companies and banks saw the sensex closing 346 points up at 14355.55. 

 The sensex snapped a four-day correction and analysts believe it could be the beginning of a pre-budget rally. Brokers also attributed the recovery to short-covering by operators as the markets will be closed tomorrow for Mahashivratri. 

 Though data showed that inflation surged to 6.73 per cent for the week ended February 3, the news could not deter the stock markets, which remained in a positive territory during the day. 

 Brokers said the market mood improved after the government announced a reduction in both petrol and diesel prices. Another trigger was strong Asian markets; the Hang Seng closed up 328.51 points, Nikkei by 144.59 points and Taiwans index shot up by 72.62 points.

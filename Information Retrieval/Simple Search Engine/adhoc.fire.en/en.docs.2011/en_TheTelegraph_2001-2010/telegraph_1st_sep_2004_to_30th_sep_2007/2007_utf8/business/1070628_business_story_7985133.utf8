 Retail chain hive-off on Biyani agenda

 REALITY CHECK

 New Delhi, June 27 (PTI): Kishore Biyani-promoted Future Group is considering hiving off successful retail chain brands into separate entities, which can even be listed in the long run.

 According to sources, the group has hired consulting firm McKinsey to advise it on ways to carve out successful retail formats such as Big Bazaar, Food Bazaar and Central Mall into independent entities and make them grow bigger.

 The group is looking at making these successful retail formats standalone subsidiaries, which in the long term could even consider their own ways of raising funds, including going public, for expansion, the sources added.

 As a step towards making the large retail formats independent of each other, the group has appointed different CEOs to head the various ventures.

 Rajan Malhotra is the CEO of Big Bazaar, while Sadashiv Nayak has taken charge of Food Bazaar. Pantaloon Apparels is headed by Kailash Bhatia as CEO.

 The groups food business is now being headed by Arvind Choudhury even as Sanjiv Agrawal continues as CEO of Pantaloon Retail.

 Central Mall and Brand Factory format is under Vishnu Prasad, who has been made the CEO.

 Future Groups idea to hive off large format retail brands stems from the fact that revenues from both its value and lifestyle retailing have been growing impressively.

 In the quarter ended March 31, 2007, value retailing, including Big Bazaar and Food Bazaar, had clocked revenues of Rs 558.46 crore, while lifestyle retailing like apparels and others registered Rs 283.32 crore.

 For the nine months ended March 31, 2007, the groups revenue from value retailing stood at Rs 1,547.71 crore while that from lifestyle retailing was Rs 630.7 crore.

 Future Group has set a target of reaching Rs 30,000 crore turnover by 2010-11 on the back of its successful retail ventures.

 It is investing about Rs 4,000 crore in the next one year to expand its retail chains, including increasing the number of Big Bazaar outlets from 50 to 100 by next year.

 The group is also adding eight more hometown stores a new format, which caters to home and housing requirements, offering right from plumbing and sanitaryware solutions to interior design and lightings.

 It is also coming up with 12 malls under Central and Brand Factory formats at places like Gurgaon, Calcutta and Chennai.

 At present, the groups flagship Pantaloon Retail has 340 stores in 40 cities under 30 formats and plans to increase it more than 10 fold by 2010-11 to 3,500 stores in 90 cities.

 The company posted a turnover of over Rs 2,018 crore in 2005-06 (ended June 2006) and is expecting a turnover of Rs 4,000 crore in the current fiscal.

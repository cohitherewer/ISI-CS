 Aussie firm in insurance pact

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 23: Australian insurance firm QBE has signed a joint venture agreement with the Rajan Raheja group (RRG) to enter Indias growing general insurance market.

 QBE will initially invest Rs 25 crore for a 26 per cent stake in the joint venture company, while Prism Cement, a Raheja group company, will hold the remaining 74 per cent.

 The agreement is subject to approval from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA). The new company is likely to begin operations in early 2008.

 The Raheja group already has interests in the life insurance sector. RRG acquired the GMR groups 49.13 per cent stake in ING Vysya Life Insurance in 2005 through Exide.

 Apart from this, the Rajan Raheja group also has a stake in ING Mutual Fund.

 QBEs decision to enter the non-life insurance market comes at a time when the sector is likely to witness complete detariffing by early next year.

 QBE will leverage its expertise in technical insurance functions as well as process and systems while RRG will assist in distribution and other areas through their knowledge of the Indian market. QBE will also nominate a managing director for the joint venture and provide technical expertise.

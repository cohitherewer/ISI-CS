 Global Steel to ink pact with Bangla

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, June 10: Pramod-Vinod Mittal-controlled Global Steel Holdings will sign a memorandum of understanding with the Bangladesh government for projects worth $2.8 billion. 

 Vinod Mittal, the younger brother of steel tycoon Laxmi Niwas Mittal, will ink the deal tomorrow at Dhaka, a company official said.

 Under the deal, the company will first conduct a feasibility study and then begin negotiations with the government on specific projects. 

 These include petrochemicals, coal mining, steel, coal-bed methane and power generation.

 Global Steel, the holding company of Ispat Industries, has operations worldwide. It has a steel-making capacity of about 14 million tonnes; and associated businesses such as mining, energy and logistics.

 The Mittal proposal comes at a time when an investment package of an almost similar size from the Tatas is hanging fire for a long time. 

 A final agreement is yet to be signed on the Tatas proposed steel, coal, power and fertiliser ventures.

 Like the Tata project, the vast reservoir of natural gas is the key to Global Steels pact. Everything depends on the availability and price of the gas, sources close to the development said.

 The Global Steel official said the non-binding and non-committal MoU would be the biggest agreement signed by the intermediate government since it took over in January. 

 The Tata proposal is yet to take off since both sides could not agree on the terms of natural gas supply and the price issue. It will be worthwhile to note which of the muti-billion dollar projects take off first. 

 Initially, Global Steel hopes to invest $2.8 billion in a range of sectors. But the exposure can go up provided the government responds positively, sources added.

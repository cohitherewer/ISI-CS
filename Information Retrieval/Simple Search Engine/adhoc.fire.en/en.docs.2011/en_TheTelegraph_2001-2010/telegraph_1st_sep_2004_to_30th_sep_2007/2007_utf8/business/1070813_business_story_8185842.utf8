 Goenka: Twin tales

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: G.P. Goenka may offload stakes in group companies Star Paper Mills and Stone India.

 The proceeds will be ploughed back to the companies, which are on an expansion mode. In the future, I would like to consolidate my business into certain core functions. The stake dilutions could be a part of such an initiative and help infuse fresh funds into these companies, said G.P. Goenka, chairman of Duncan Group.

 Goenka expects to increase Stone Indias turnover to Rs 300 crore from around Rs 130 crore in the next two to three years. 

 The company plans to set up another unit in Hyderabad at an investment of Rs 50 crore.

 The (Hyderabad) plant will manufacture electronic components of power products. We are likely to finalise the details by the year-end, Goenka said.

 After the Hyderabad unit starts production, the Baddi unit in Uttarakhand will focus on supplying to Indian Railways and the city plant on exports.

 The existing Hyderabad unit will also make electronic items for the railways such as signalling products.

 The railways decision to retrofit air dryers for both diesel and electric locomotives, introduce mounted brake system and end of train telemetry system for freight cars and manufacture high-speed coaches is expected to generate good business opportunities. We aim to become a complete railway solutions company that manufactures each and every component, Goenka said.

 In the next two years, Stone India is expected to record an export turnover of Rs 30 crore.

 Star Paper Mills has got an in-principle approval of the board of directors to embark on a Rs 500-crore expansion plan. This will double its capacity from around 80,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) to 150,000 tpa. The expansion will take two years from zero date to be completed. It will take place in the companys existing facility, said Goenka.

 The plan includes solving bleaching capacity problems, revamping old production units that produce only 40 to 50 tonnes per day and changing the product mix towards value-added products. The funds will be raised through internal accrual and debts.

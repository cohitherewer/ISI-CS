 Whiff of hope for wheat

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

New Delhi, March 12: In a bid to encourage wheat farmers to sell enough stocks to government agencies, a group of ministers is planning to dole out a bonus over and above the minimum support price already announced.

 Stunned by the recent poll reversals and with the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections round the corner, the central government is now determined to keep prices of essential commodities under control in order to ease inflationary pressure.

 The ruling Congress party has already lost two state Assembly elections this year and inflation is being cited as one of the factors behind the loss.

 The group of ministers (GoM) will also take a call on extending duty free import of wheat as a safety measure in case traders hoard the crop and jack up prices. 

 Within the government, there is a view that imported wheat should be used as a buffer in case the government is unable to procure enough to distribute through its nation-wide ration shops. However, others have argued that there is no need for this. 

 Soaring wheat prices, prompted by crop failure and low stocks of grain with state-run food distribution agencies coupled with higher oil prices, had fuelled an inflationary spiral last year. 

 Though wheat production this year at 72.5 mt is higher by 3 million tonnes compared with last year, there are worries on the procurement front as traders may hoard a large portion of the new crop. 

 Already, a number of big traders have been unofficially warned. But the government is still worried about another round of increase in food prices and is likely to take additional measures to keep inflation in check. 

 Sources said the GoM may recommend a bonus to wheat farmers on top of the MSP of Rs 750 a quintal. The agriculture ministry, sources said, is in favour of a bonus of Rs 50 being added to the price to ensure farmers to sell to state agencies and not to private cartels which may corner the grain to drive up prices. 

 The abnormal rise in prices last year occurred partly because farmers grew less wheat and partly because private traders had cornered most of the stock and the government had very little lying in its buffer stocks.

 The countrys wheat output in the last crop was about 69.48 mt, against a target of 75.5 mt.

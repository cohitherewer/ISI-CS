 Fillip for sick fertiliser plants

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 12: The Union cabinet today approved the fertiliser ministrys proposal to revive the sick plants of Hindustan Fertiliser Corporation Ltd (HFC) at Barauni, Durgapur and Haldia.

 It also cleared the revival of Fertiliser Corporation of Indias units at Sindri, Ramagundam, Gorakhpur, Talcher and Korba. An in-principle approval has been given to reverse the NDA governments decision to close the sick units of FCI and HFC, information and broadcasting minister P.R. Das Munshi said. According to an official, the government will try to fund the revival from its coffers, failing which the joint venture route will be adopted.

 The joint venture could either be with a public or a private sector company, but the government will hold a 51 per cent stake. The ministry is optimistic about turning these units around as their profitability is likely to improve on the back of a rise in fertiliser prices. Consultants can be appointed to chalk out the revival plans, the minister said. The proposal would then come back to the cabinet. 

 Jute support price

 The government will raise the minimum support price of raw jute by Rs 55 per quintal to Rs 1,055 per quintal for 2007-08 to protect the interest of growers. The clearance was given by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on the recommendation of the Commission on Agriculture Cost and Prices, Das Munshi said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Baosteel set to climb the ladder

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Sept. 5: Baosteel Group Corporation, Chinas leading steel producer, hopes to become the second largest steel company of the world after ArcelorMittal by 2012.

 The company will more than triple output to 80 million tonnes in the next five years from 26mt now.

 In an internal newsletter quoted by China Daily today, the state-run company said it would reach sales worth $50 billion and a profit of $5 billion by then.

 Baosteels statement took the steel industry by surprise as a few others in the production pecking order were vying for the coveted second slot.

 Tata Steel, which vaulted to the number six slot just after Baosteel from 56th after acquiring Anglo-Dutch Corus Group Plc had also said it could become the second largest with a production of 40 million tonnes by 2012.

 Tata Steel made the statement during a presentation to analysts in Mumbai on May 18, the day it came out with its annual numbers for 2006-07.

 While Tata Steel has not ruled out further acquisitions, the companys new projects within and outside India will play an important role in capacity expansion.

 However, greenfield projects bring with them several teething problems.

 In contrast, state-owned Baosteel may find it easier to grow with the help of a favourable government policy that encourages domestic companies to merge.

 Baosteels Zhanjiang project, which is expected to get the governments approval soon, will boost the groups output by 20 million tonnes by 2012. 

 Baosteel has to increase its output, mainly through mergers and alliances with other mainland companies, Xu Lejiang, president of Shanghai headquartered Baosteel, was quoted as saying in the newsletter.

 In 2005, the National Development and Reform Commission set new targets for Chinas steel industry. It said the output of the nations top 10 steel makers should account for over 50 per cent of the countrys total output by 2010 and over 70 per cent by 2020.

 China now accounts for a third of global steel production with a capacity of over 400mt.

 Japanese steel makers Nippon Steel and JFE are now at the number two and three slot, way below ArcelorMittals 110mt capacity but close to Baosteel, Tata Steel and Posco.

 Posco and Tata Steel are expanding vigorously but across geographies.

 New Delhi, June 1: War of words or tariff war, the telecom sector has it all. 

 Two weeks into his job as communications minister, A. Raja is already taking the credit for making free incoming roaming calls a reality. State-run BSNL and MTNL today slashed roaming incoming tariffs to zero for the first 300 minutes. 

 My predecessor Dayanidhi Maran had talked of waiving roaming charges, but no initiative was taken on his part to form a constructive plan, said Raja. 

 The governments move sparked off a tariff war with Reliance Communications announcing free incoming roaming calls up to 900 minutes.

 Tata Teleservices already has a price plan offering 500 minutes of free incoming roaming. 

 Bharti Airtel, Hutch, Idea and Spice are likely to announce price cuts too.

 Earlier this week, Raja met Tata Teleservices chairman Ratan Tata, Bharti chief Sunil Mittal and Reliance Communications chairman Anil Ambani to discuss the possibilities of reducing national roaming rates to zero, a official in the department of telecom said.

 Raja is also looking at reducing international roaming rates, which are as high as Rs 60 per minute for countries such as Thailand and Malaysia, the official said.

 BSNL and MTNL customers will now pay just Re 1 for incoming calls and Re 0.40 for outgoing calls within any visiting network as part of a new post-paid plan to be launched on June 3. This will be on calls beyond the first 300 minutes of free roaming.

 However, outgoing and incoming calls to networks outside the visiting state will be charged at Re 1. The state-owned PSUs are charging a rental of Rs 550 for the zero incoming roaming rental plan.

 Raja is also keen to place the comprehensive policy report on 3G services in the monsoon session of Parliament. 

 Dayanidhi Maran was to announce the 3G policy in the first week of May. 

 Both the operators are expecting 20-25 per cent jump in their traffic with this scheme. 

 Private operator Reliance Communications, which is charging Rs 990 as monthly rental for its plan, offers similar rates of Re 1 for incoming calls and Re 0.50 for outgoing calls within any visiting network, after the customer exhausts the 900 minutes of free incoming. 

 All outgoing calls made to networks outside the visiting state will be charged at Re 1 for the Reliance plan which becomes effective from today. 

 The new roaming rates are targeted towards frequently travelling high usage subscribers. With the new plans the companies expect to tap the highly mobile business class.

 Asked if roaming charges would eventually become zero, Raja said: It will be done in future. Today is the first step towards it.

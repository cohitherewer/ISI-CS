The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Move to settle IOC-port row

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Behuria: Tough stand

 New Delhi, March 25: The government will ask Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) to pay an annual charge to resolve the dispute between the firm and Calcutta Port Trust over wharfage charges for an oil pipeline passing through the Hooghly river.

 It will adopt a middle-of-the-road solution to settle the row. A senior petroleum ministry official told The Telegraph that IOC may be asked to pay a reasonable annual fee and not wharfage charges based on the volume of petroleum products moved through the pipeline, which the port is demanding. 

 The IOC pipeline carries petrol and diesel from the Haldia refinery to its Budge Budge terminal that feeds the petrol pumps in Calcutta and the adjoining region.

 An 8-km stretch of the pipeline from Raghudevpur passes under the Hooghly river-bed. Calcutta Port Trust has been demanding Rs 3 crore as wharfage charges every year for allowing the pipeline to pass through its territory.

 IOC has refused to pay up the money on the ground that the pipeline does not interfere with the flow of traffic on the Hooghly or make use of any land at the port.

 IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria said, We will not pay any money to Calcutta Port as the international example that the port authorities have been citing is not relevant in the Indian context. 

 The port trust needs to keep in mind that IOC is a government-owned company that meets a lot of social objectives as well, he said. 

 Senior IOC officials feel that the company has already come under financial strain as international crude prices have skyrocketed and there has been no increase in the price of domestic petroleum products to compensate for this increase.

 Under these circumstances, the company needs to drastically cut down costs. Certain investments for improving the quality of petrol and diesel have also got to be made to meet the stringent emission norms. This investment does not lead to any economic gains for the company by way of higher prices for the transport fuels. 

 Senior IOC officials feel that the port authorities see the oil companies as cash-rich entities which can be tapped for raking in easy money.

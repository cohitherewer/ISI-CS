 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ranchi, June 13: Arcelor Mittal today said its greenfield project in Jharkhand would be put on the fast track. 

 M.P. Singh, managing director (iron ore) of Arcelor Mittal, met chief secretary A.K. Chug, industry secretary S.K. Satpathy and mines and geology secretary J.S. Tiwari and discussed the project. 

 Singh said the meetings with the senior government officials were fruitful. 

 The state government is an important stakeholder in our project and we have solicited its support for the success of the project, Singh said. Arcelor Mittal has signed an MoU with Jharkhand for its 12-million-tonne steel plant at an investment of Rs 43,000 crore. 

 The company is waiting for the declaration of the rehabilitation and resettlement policy by the state to kick off its project. Singh said the company would fulfil all the conditions laid down in the agreement, including applying for land and iron ore leases and getting water for the project. 

 He added that the state had promised the right quantity and quality of iron ore for its project.

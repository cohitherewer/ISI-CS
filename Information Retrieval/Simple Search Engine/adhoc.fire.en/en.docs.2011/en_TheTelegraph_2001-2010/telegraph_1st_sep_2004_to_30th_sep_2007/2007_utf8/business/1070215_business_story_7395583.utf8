 Numaligarh diesel for Bangla 

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New horizons

 New Delhi, Feb. 14: The decks seem to have been cleared for the export of diesel from Numaligarh Refinery (NRL) to Bangladesh across the Brahmaputra.

 Sources said the Bangladesh cabinet has decided to allow Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation import 1.2 lakh tonnes of diesel a year from NRL.

 Bangladesh Petroleum officials are believed to have informed NRL that a formal offer to buy diesel would be made soon.

 Valued at Rs 300 crore, the deal gives NRL a $5.49 premium per barrel on the free-on-board (fob) international price of diesel.

 In bilateral meetings earlier, India had said that it wanted Bangladesh to make use of the concessions under the agreement on South Asian Free Trade Area (Safta) and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) to redress Bangladeshs trade deficit with India. 

 NRL is offering diesel at competitive rates to Bangladesh as the country is currently getting its supplies from the Gulf. This entails huge transport cost as the ships from the Gulf have to go around Sri Lanka to reach Chittagong, the main port of Bangladesh.

 After the consignment reaches Chittagong, there is a long haul into the hinterland that is more easily accessible from Numaligarh. 

 NRL is virtually in the backyard of Bangladesh and there is a huge saving in transport costs if the diesel is supplied directly, a senior official said.

 NRL has already sent a consignment of diesel to Budge Budge in Bengal on a barge that sailed down the Brahmaputra through Bangladesh. The waterway has been successfully tested, and it takes eight days for the barge to reach the river port of Baghbari in Bangladesh.

 NRL expects to export 10,000 tonnes of diesel every month. The diesel will move by road to Silghat by the Brahmaputra, where it will be loaded on the barge for Bangladesh.

 Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is also willing to double diesel exports from its Haldia refinery to Bangladesh to 60,000 tonnes per month from 30,000 tonnes.

 Bangladesh imports about 4.3 million tonnes of petroleum products every year. 

 While the country has a term contract with India and Kuwait for buying part of these products, the rest is picked up from the spot market.

 IOC exports diesel from its Haldia refinery and given the close proximity to Bangladesh, it has an edge because of the low transport cost. 

 However, Kuwait has abundant supplies of crude oil and, therefore, can afford to sell petroleum products at a cheap price.

 With additional Ravva crude being made available to the refineries in the Northeast, the output of petroleum products has gone up and the refineries have surplus petrol, diesel and aviation turbine fuel which can be exported.

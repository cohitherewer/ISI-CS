 Goldman sees big gain in small deals

New York, Feb. 3 (Reuters): Goldman Sachs Group sees big opportunities in smaller deals. Seeking ways to boost banking fees after hitting record levels last year, Goldman intends to do more deals with middle market companies with market value ranging from $500 million to $2 billion. These companies together comprise the bulk of the US economy and a lucrative source of new business. 

 The middle market is an area historically we do not cover very well, said Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein during a Merrill Lynch investor conference in November. He said middle-market deals would be a top priority. 

 Most of Wall Streets top-tier banks have launched middle-market efforts during previous merger-and-acquisition booms, only to retreat when the fees were too small or when deal activity dried up. 

 Blankfein said Goldman would make small deals pay off by advising, financing and investing its own capital with clients. The triple-play strategy has helped it to reap record gains and fees from some of the biggest deals of recent years. 

 Being an adviser, financier and co-investor allows us to realise opportunities that did not exist when banking was a pure advisory business, Blankfein said. 

 Goldmans effort will follow the moves by Citigroup, Merrill Lynch amp; Co and Bank of America Corp in recent years to tap into that market. 

 Leveraged buyout firms like Texas Pacific Group are also turning their attention to a sector that is bustling, boasts higher margins and has room to grow. There were about 1,200 deals, between $50 million and $500 million last year, according to Mergerstat, with total value up 14 per cent to about $200 billion. 

 Overall M amp;A activity reached a record last year, but mid-market deals are still short of the 1,400 booked in 2000. Thats why youre seeing more of the New York firms opening up mid-market practices, said Mark Brady, head of M amp;A at Chicago bank William Blair amp; Co. 

 Goldmans entrance could be bad news for mid-market specialists, such as Jefferies Group Inc, Piper Jaffray Cos and Houlihan Lokey Howard amp; Zukin, which have benefited in the absence of the top-tier banks. 

 Marquee name

 Some boards will choose a big banks marquee name and the capital they can provide. 

 But scale doesnt always guarantee success, bankers and analysts agree. Middle-market chief executives, they added, want top-shelf service something that giant banks may be reluctant to provide when the fees are middling. 

 If youre the CEO of a $300-million company, you have to ask yourself, How important am I to them? Brady said. Big banks like Goldman arent geared to trading stocks or providing research and banking services to middle-sized companies, Jefferies CEO Richard Handler said in an interview. 

 (Goldman is) an unbelievable powerhouse of a firm, but its a very different business, Handler said. Its one thing to say you want to come into this market, but you also need quality research. You have to traffic in those stocks and have senior bankers committed to these companies. 

 Ultimately, according to mid-market bankers, big firms find it hard to keep focused on lower-fee deals. Goldmans average deal size last year was $2.9 billion, according to Dealogic, versus roughly $200 million in the middle market. 

 If you dont follow companies in that space, you cant credibly say youre a middle-market player, Piper investment banking head Jon Salveson said. Its really hard to be pulled in both directions, to be a primary coverage person for a global company, and at the same time pitch your best advice to a client with $30 million in revenue. 

 UBS analyst Glenn Schorr expects Goldman to make inroads and eventually be among the top five banks in this area.

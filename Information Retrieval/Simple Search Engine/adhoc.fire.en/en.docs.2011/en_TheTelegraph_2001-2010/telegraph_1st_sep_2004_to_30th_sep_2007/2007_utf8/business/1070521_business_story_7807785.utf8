 Dont get lured by the guaranteed returns in insurance plans, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 Guaranteed returns on life insurance plans are back. Insurers are offering guarantees in their conventional plans to attract buyers who seek an assured return and do not want to risk their money to the vagaries of the stock markets as in the case of unit-linked insurance plans.

 The guarantees come in various forms as additions to the sum assured, premium pay-back, capital protection, annuity. Almost all insurers have one or more such cover Mahalife by Tata-AIG Life Insurance, Jeevan Akshay by LIC, InvestShield by ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Unit Plus II Pension by SBI Life.

 Is it a good idea? 

 Should a person buy a guaranteed policy? The simple answer is: No. By opting for a guaranteed pay-back plan one ends up paying more.

 Let us explain it with the example of a recent plan from Aviva Life Insurance. 

 Whats assured?

 The company has launched a conventional, non-unit linked plan called Dhan Vriddhi, which offers a guaranteed addition to the sum assured at the rate of 7 per cent every year till maturity or death. 

 The premium payment period under the plan is less than the term of the policy and it also comes with a money-back feature 20 per cent of sum assured after every five years. 

 On the face of it, the plan appears quite attractive. But take a closer look at the premium cost. A 25-year-old person who takes a Dhan Vriddhi plan for Rs 2 lakh for 15 years pays an annual premium of Rs 27,894. The policyholder will have to pay the premium for 10 years in a 15-year policy and his total premium adds up to Rs 2,78,940.

 Every year the sum assured of the policy, Rs 2 lakh, is increased by 7 per cent by the insurer and the policyholder gets back 20 per cent of the sum assured, or Rs 40,000, at the end of every five years. 

 On survival of the policy term (15 years), the policyholder will get Rs 4,10,000 and on death in the 15th year, the insurer will pay Rs 4,76,000. 

 Ulips no better 

 Now, compare it with Avivas unit-linked plan EasyLife Plus. A policyholder of the same age and policy term pays an annual premium of Rs 27,900 and gets a higher sum assured of Rs 2,79,000. How much he/she will get after 15 years will depend on the accumulation in fund value. 

 The unit value of EasyLife Plus, bought before the new Ulip rules were implemented in July last year, now stands at Rs 30.31. 

 However, unlike mutual funds, the NAV of a unit-linked insurance plan doesnt truly reflect how much the policyholder will actually get on redemption. 

 The rate of allocation of premium to an investment fund is different from that in a mutual fund. Annual charges in Ulips are also deducted by knocking off the units accumulated in the policyholders fund. 

 If a premium of Rs 100 is allocated to the investment fund, the number of units in the policyholders fund will actually be less than three (at the NAV of Rs 30.31). 

 On death during the policy term, the beneficiary of the policyholder will get the investment fund or the sum assured, whichever is higher.

 Pure term

 In contrast, if a 25-year-old person buys a pure term assurance policy from Aviva for a term of 15 years, he/she can pay an annual premium of Rs 2,860 and get an insurance coverage of Rs 11 lakh! However, on survival of the policy term, the premium paid (Rs 2,860x15 = Rs 42,900) is not refunded. 

 But if the person invests Rs 25,000 every year (that he/she saves by buying a pure term assurance policy) in a PPF account at an 8 per cent interest, the savings in the account at the end of 15 years will be Rs 7,31,107. This is much higher than what he/she gets (on survival of the policy term) from Dhan Vriddhi, the guaranteed insurance policy. The death benefit will be higher as under the pure term assurance plan the coverage is Rs 11 lakh compared with only Rs 2 lakh in Dhan Vriddhi or Rs 2.79 lakh in EasyLife Plus.

 Buy only insurance

 If we compare products across all insurance companies we find the best thing to buy from an insurer is insurance and not a savings or investment plan. Insurance is financial protection for a family in case the breadwinner dies during his/her working life. One can ensure that the family gets a higher sum by choosing a low-cost pure term-assurance plan and investing the rest in instruments such as PPF, fixed deposits or mutual funds.

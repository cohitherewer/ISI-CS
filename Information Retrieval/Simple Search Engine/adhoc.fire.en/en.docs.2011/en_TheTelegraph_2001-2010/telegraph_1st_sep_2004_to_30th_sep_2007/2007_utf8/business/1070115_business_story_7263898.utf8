 Debt-to-death risk

 Bancassurance has come of age in India, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 Last month, the Kerala-based Federal Bank sent out a mailer to its home loan borrowers offering insurance protection. It said all the existing and new home loan borrowers could get life insurance cover up to the amount of the loan outstanding by paying a small, one-time premium. 

 The insurance works like this: if the borrower dies within the loan repaying tenure, the insurance company will pay the outstanding loan to the bank. However, if the borrower survives the loan tenure, he or she will not get back the premium paid for the insurance cover. 

 Home loan is one of the many products that banks sell wrapped with an insurance cover since bancassurance took root in the country three years ago. 

 In the beginning

 Bancassurance an integration of core banking products, such as deposits, mortgage and loans, with insurance first originated in France in 1980. It became all the rage in Europe in the 1990s.

 In India, banks were allowed to sell insurance products three years ago. Insurers are now reporting that more than 20 per cent of their fresh premium income come from the bancassurance channel (banks as corporate agents). The average premium ticket from bancassurance is also the highest among all other distribution channels, such as direct sales force and other corporate agents. 

 Corporate agents

 Neither banks nor insurers have so far made enough efforts to take bancassurance beyond its simplest form that is, banks selling insurance policies as corporate agents. While every other bank offers a loan cover term assurance for its mortgage and other loan products, such as personal loan, car loan and education loan, the products havent gained in popularity. 

 Integrated product

 However, bancassurance as an integrated product can play a pivotal role in your overall financial and insurance planning. Lets see how. Let us assume that 30-year-old Sumit takes a home loan of Rs 1 lakh for five years from the Federal Bank. If he takes the insurance protection that is being offered by the bank, he will have to pay a one-time premium of Rs 514 in addition to his equated monthly instalment. The bank will also give Sumit a loan to pay his insurance premium if he cannot fork it out at one go and he can repay that sum to the bank along with his EMI. In that case, his EMI will go up by Rs 10 only.

 Now consider this. Sumit doesnt take the insurance protection for the loan cover and instead buys a basic endowment life insurance policy. His annual premium for a sum assured of Rs 1 lakh for five years works out to Rs 20,983. 

 What would happen if Sumit dies a year after he has taken the home loan? 

 In the first case, the insurance company would pay his outstanding loan to the bank, while the house would continue to belong to Sumits family. In the second case, Sumits family would have to claim the insurance amount and clear the banks loan. 

 But look at the premium figures one is Rs 514 and the other is Rs 20,983. Sumit would have saved Rs 20,469 had he opted for the first option.

 On survival of the five-year term, Sumit would not have got back the premium (Rs 514) he had paid for the insurance protection. In the second case, he would get back Rs 1 lakh sum assured plus any bonus announced by the insurer, but he would have paid a total premium of Rs 1,04,915.

 Had Sumit chosen the first option and paid a one-time premium of Rs 514, he could have invested Rs 20,469 in any other saving instrument or could simply use it to prepay the housing loan. 

 Bet against death

 Insurance is a bet against death, not life. Insurance should be bought to ensure financial protection to dependants in case of the death of the breadwinner. So, the earning life of a person must be insured against any misfortune. But since one has to shoulder all the financial liabilities, such as buying a house, childrens education, childrens marriage and finally making provisions for old age, during the earning life itself, one needs to carefully plan his/her insurance cover. Insurance is protection not a reward against risk. Hence, insurance and investment should be kept separate. If your insurance premium outgo is very high, you wont be able to save more and build a bigger financial kitty for future needs. 

 Whats on offer?

 Banks offer various bancassurance products to their customers such as personal accident insurance with credit cards and deposit schemes. These covers are mostly offered free, while some carry a small premium. They also offer a loan term cover on personal, car and education loans. 

 Another bancassurance product that has not found much favour is the group medical insurance that banks offer to their deposit account holders and their families at a much cheaper rate than they would otherwise have got. 

 These policies are not stand-alone products, but come bundled with deposit accounts savings, recurring or fixed. The premium on such integrated medical insurance plans is at least half the cost of stand-alone policies being sold by insurance companies themselves, while the benefits remain the same. Almost all public sector banks offer these plans to their customers.

 Bank unions demand end to outsourcing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Singh: Bank on me

 New Delhi, March 19: Bank unions today requested Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to permit public sector banks to resume large-scale recruitments and stop outsourcing work as it would hit jobs. 

 The Prime Minister gave us a patient hearing and said he would get in touch with the finance minister to look into our demands, bank union convenor Prafullo Kumar Patnaik said after a 30-minute meeting.

 The Prime Ministers meeting with the union leaders was part of the governments move to calm frayed nerves in the wake of the proposed three-day all-India bank strike from March 28.

 The unions claim that while there has been a sharp increase in the workload, banks have put a ban on recruitment, leaving more than one lakh vacancies. This is forcing bank employees to work for extra hours without overtime.

 The bank unions are scheduled to meet representatives of the Indian Banks Association in Mumbai tomorrow. 

 V.K. Gupta, who is the Delhi convenor of the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), said the government should also allow banks to recruit men on compassionate grounds after the death of an employee.

 The UFBU, comprising nine bank unions and representing over 10 lakh employees, also asked the government to provide a second option for bank workers wanting to opt for the pension scheme. 

 Many employees did not join the pension scheme because of the earlier stipulation that their years of service would factor in the number of days they go for a strike.

 Earlier this month, public sector banks had organised a march to Parliament to voice their pension-related demands. They had then announced their intentions of calling a strike. 

 The leaders also complained that the managements had stopped employment on compassionate grounds, depriving employees of social security at a critical time.

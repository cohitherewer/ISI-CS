 Bid deadline looms on Hutch suitors

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, Feb. 8: After a brief lull, theres action on the Hutchison Essar front once again. Hutchison Telecommunications International (HTIL) is understood to have asked key players vying for its 67 per cent stake in the Indian telecom venture to submit their bids by Friday evening.

 The four key players are Vodafone Group, Reliance Communications (R-Com), the Essar and the Hinduja groups. 

 Although details are sketchy at this stage as officials from all these entities refrained from making any comment, available information suggest that Vodafone could start the process by stumping up the first bid.

 An official, who belongs to one of the companies in the race, said it had received a communication from the Hong Kong-based company late last night. However, an HTIL spokesperson told The Telegraph over the line from Hong Kong, We have no comment on this matter.

 It is further learnt that Hutchison is unlikely to go in for an open auction. Instead, it could seek bids from the suitors. Although a reserve bid has not yet been set so far, sources say the base price that is emerging for the 67 per cent stake is around $14 billion.

 Sources also said preliminary bids would be made and a clear picture would emerge within a week. A final decision is expected by the end of February or early next month.

 The bidders are keeping their cards close to their chest. Bobby Leach, spokesperson for the Vodafone Group, told The Telegraph from London that they are not going to comment on the process. Leach even refrained from commenting on whether the worlds largest cellular company had received a communication from HTIL on Wednesday. 

 A spokesperson for the Essar group, R-Com and the Hinduja Group also did not offer any comment. 

 While the Essar group now holds 33 per cent in the telecom venture, sources said the Ruias might not join the others in placing a bid for the 67 per cent stake. Instead, it could harp on its right of first refusal clause and match the offer made by its rivals. The group has already tied up financing with a consortium of banks.

 The strategy of Anil Ambanis R-Com is also not clear, though sources close to the group said it was waiting for Vodafone to make the first move.

 This leaves the Hindujas, who are still in the process of conducting due diligence of Hutch Essars books. There are unconfirmed reports which say the group would join hands with Qatar Telecom or Telecom Italia.

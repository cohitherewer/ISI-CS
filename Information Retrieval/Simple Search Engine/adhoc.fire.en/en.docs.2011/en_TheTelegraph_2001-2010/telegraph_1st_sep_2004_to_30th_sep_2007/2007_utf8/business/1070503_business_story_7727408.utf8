 Headache for private car insurers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 2: The government is planning to make it mandatory

 for private general insurance companies to provide third-party motor

 cover.

 ldquo;The Left parties have supported the move to make it mandatory

 for private insurance companies to sell third-party motor insurance,

 which at present is mostly done by public sector insurers, rdquo; a

 finance ministry official said.

 A motor insurance policy comprises two basic

 components mdash; own damage and third-party liability.

 A third-party cover is essentially insurance

 against damage (injury or death) to any other

 vehicle or person. Under the motor vehicles

 act, it is mandatory for all vehicle owners,

 including those of two-wheelers, cars and commercial vehicles, to take

 third-party insurance.

 The finance ministry wants to make third-party

 mandatory for the entire general insurance

 industry. The change will be made through amendments

 to the Insurance Act, 1938.

 However, the Left parties are opposing the

 insurnace bill since it has a provision for

 raising the foreign direct investment limit

 from 26 per cent to 49 per cent.

 The official said the group of ministers on

 insurance would soon meet the Left leaders

 to iron out differences.

 There are complaints that private insurance

 companies do not provide third-party insurance,

 especially for older vehicles. 

 Under the proposed insurance bill, the official

 said, 

 it would be legally compulsory for private

 players to provide third-party insurance, failing

 which they could be penalised.

 The ministry

 said apart from Left parties, public 

 sector insurance companies and trade unions

 have also pressed for the need to share losses.

 Non-life insurance companies, which claim to

 be suffering losses in third-party 

 motor insurance and some health insurance products,

 are likely to oppose the move.

 The ministry, however, feels that once the

 bill gets parliamentary approval, rules can

 be worked out to protect insurers from unnecessary

 claims and check losses.

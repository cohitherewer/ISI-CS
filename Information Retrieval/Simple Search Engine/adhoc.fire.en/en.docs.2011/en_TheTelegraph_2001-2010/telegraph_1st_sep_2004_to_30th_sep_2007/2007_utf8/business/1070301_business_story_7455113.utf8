The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Dream goes bust

 In last years budget, the outlay for agriculture and allied activities was increased by 25.2 per cent, while the budget for irrigation was higher by 40 per cent. 

 The revised estimate for the current year shows the government has missed its spending targets for both agriculture and irrigation. 

 Of course, it has also hiked the bank lending targets for agriculture, which might make up for the shortfall.

 A similar lack of urgency is seen in the outlay for energy, which is up 15 per cent. 

 Last year, the budgeted increase in outlay on energy was 29.5 per cent. That target, too, wasnt reached.

 In short, the finance minister has depended upon modest targets for capital expenditure combined with buoyancy in tax receipts to prune the fiscal deficit. 

 Also, while nobody expected any reforms because of the elections and because of Left opposition, the fact remains that reforms are essential to boost productivity.

 What about inflation? The government has reduced customs duties and excise duties on some items to attack inflation, but its unlikely to be enough. 

 Data shows that the rise in the prices of food articles and basic metals and products is responsible for about half of the total inflation and there is little anybody can do about that in the short term.

 The RBI will, therefore, continue to use monetary policy to stamp out inflation, as deputy governor Rakesh Mohan has indicated. 

 The government knows well enough that rising prices can lose elections while voters have so far shown scant regard for higher growth. 

 Bond yields ended up higher on Wednesday despite the low level of government borrowing projected in the budget, on precisely these concerns. 

 The action in the stock market was overshadowed by the global meltdown. 

 But even if global markets rebound, the question that needs to be asked is: with the RBI tightening monetary policy and with the finance ministry tightening the fiscal deficit, can the market continue to fight government policy aimed at slowing the economy? 

 The third quarter GDP growth of 8.6 per cent, the lowest in four quarters, shows the Reserve Bank of Indias measures are already taking effect.

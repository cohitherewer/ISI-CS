 Tab likely to rise on open-end mutuals

 Cold truths

 Calcutta, Jan. 21: Retail investors will have to shell out more for mutual fund investments this year. There are indications of the cost going up further, particularly in open-ended schemes.

 Almost all fund houses have started charging an entry fee between 1.5 per cent and 2.25 per cent on each instalment of systematic investment plans in equity schemes, besides slapping an exit load of 2-2.25 per cent for redemption of units within one year from the last instalment paid.

 Moreover, many fund houses such as Tata Mutual Fund, UTI Mutual Fund and Fidelity Mutual Fund, charge an exit load on retail investments less than Rs 1 crore if redeemed within three to six months. 

 Fund houses are now planning to increase the entry load for open-ended equity schemes, at least for the new offerings, but are now waiting for a first mover to take the lead. In its draft prospectus for the gold exchange traded fund filed with the market regulator, Kotak Mutual Fund has proposed an entry load of 4 per cent.

 In April last year, the stock market regulator disallowed fund houses from deducting their initial issue expenses in an open-ended fund from the schemes net asset value over a period of five years and, instead, directed them to charge the expenses during the new fund offer period itself. Since then, mutual funds have almost stopped offering fresh open-ended equity schemes.

 As of now, we dont have a new open-ended scheme in the pipeline, said Rajesh Bhojani, president (sales), UTI Mutual Fund. The fund house has a slew of products, including a gold exchange traded fund, in the offing and launched two closed-end funds last month.

 However, we may consider one if we find that there is a need segment where we do not have a product, Bhojani added. Fund houses are waiting for the first mover in the industry to hike entry fees for new funds. Sooner than later, you will find mutual fund houses adopting a multi-distribution strategy to reduce their issue expenses, Bhojani said. 

 Zero entry-load funds also exist alongside those charging 5-6 per cent entry load in developed markets. Fund houses in matured markets sell their zero entry-load funds directly to investors without the intermediation of a distributor or agent, thereby reducing the distribution cost to a large extent. We may see this happen soon. However, retail investors should understand that there is a huge cost involved in selling a new product, he said.

 The problem is bigger with schemes that aim to mobilise large funds, said Amandeep Chopra, a senior fund manager with UTI Mutual Fund.

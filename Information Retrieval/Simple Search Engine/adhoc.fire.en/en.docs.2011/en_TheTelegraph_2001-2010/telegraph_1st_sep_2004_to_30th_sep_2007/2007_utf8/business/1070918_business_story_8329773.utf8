 Nokia to buy US ad firm

 - Mobile players extend reach with new deals

 Helsinki, Sept. 17 (Reuters): Nokia today said it would buy Enpocket, the US cellphone screen advertising firm.

 This is a very interesting move. It gives a clear picture of the speed in which Nokias new organisation is expanding into software and services, said eQ analyst Jari Honko.

 After a slow start, mobile companies are making moves into the lucrative market of mobile advertising, helped by new technologies and the spread of more advanced phones.

 Nokia shares rose 0.8 per cent to trade at 24.53 euros and were the top European blue-chip gainers compared with a 1.7 per cent loss for the DJ Stoxx 50. 

 Nokia did not disclose financial details of the deal which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. 

 Boston-based Enpocket has a staff strength of 120 and its clients include Vodafone, Pepsi, Telefonica, BT, and MasterCard.

 Nokia said it believed mobile advertising will be an important element in monetising consumer Internet services.

 The Finland-based company unveiled a wide push into mobile consumer Internet services last month, unveiling its Ovi service, which will combine a digital music store and a gaming service with its navigation offering. 

 Interactive advertising on mobiles can create tremendous value for the industry while bringing Internet services to people around the world, Enpocket president Mike Baker said.

 Prop for select PSUs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 12: The retirement age of employees of profit-making central public sector undertakings (PSUs) has been raised to 60 from 58 years.

 The cabinet, presided over by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, decided to offer this incentive to those profit-making PSUs which have not taken any budgetary support from the government for the last three years, information amp; broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said.

 Das Munshi said the final decision would eventually lie with the minister in charge of administering the undertaking or enterprise concerned. 

 The cabinet has simply empowered the minister to exercise his discretion for those companies, which have reported net profits for the last three years according to audited annual accounts, the minister said. The PSU, however, should also not seek any budgetary support from the government in the future, said Das Munshi.

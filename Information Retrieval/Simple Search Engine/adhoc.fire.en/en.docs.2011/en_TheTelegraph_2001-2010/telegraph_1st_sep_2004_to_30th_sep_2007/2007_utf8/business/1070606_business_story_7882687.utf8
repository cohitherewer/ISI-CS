 Maya order hits UP sugar mills

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 In blue funk

 Mumbai, June 5: The Mayawati governments decision to scrap the Sugar Industry Promotion Policy 2004 has dealt a body blow to sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh, which are already reeling under the burden of excess production and low retail prices.

 The policy, which was devised by the Mulayam Singh Yadav regime, provided various incentives to sugar units in the state.

 The decision to scrap the policy has sparked worry that it will dent the financials of these units.

 Several leading sugar mills, including Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar amp; Industries Ltd, Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd, the KK Birla group, DCM Sriram Consolidated, Triveni Dwarikesh Sugar and Mawana Sugar are waiting for the new government to announce the new policy.

 Bajaj Hindusthan and Balrampur Chini have significant operations in the state. Bajaj Hindusthan, which produces 1.5 million tonnes of sugar annually, has nine plants in various locations. Balrampur Chini has six factories in eastern Uttar Pradesh with an aggregate crushing capacity of over 55,000 tonnes per day.

 The sugar policy was formulated primarily to boost industrialisation in a state which is one of the largest sugarcane producers in the country. 

 The Mulayam Singh government had provided capital and transport subsidies in addition to tax exemptions. If a manufacturer invested Rs 350 crore in setting up a sugar unit, he was given a five-year tax break. This stretched to 10 years if the investment crossed Rs 500 crore.

 The result of this policy was that 28 new sugar mills came up in the state between 2004 and 2006 with an aggregate investment estimated at Rs 5,000 crore, said a senior executive with a leading sugar company.

 He added that any move to withdraw tax benefits to existing companies would impact their balancesheets.

 Both Balrampur Chini and Bajaj Hindusthan today informed stock exchanges of the withdrawal of the policy. 

 Bajaj Hindusthan said, The company would be able to comment on the impact of the cancellation of the policy once it receives detailed communications in this regard. Nevertheless, it is imperative to mention that the cancellation of the Sugar Promotion Policy 2004 would have a significant adverse impact on the financials of the company, which is not quantifiable at this stage.

 The announcements led to a sharp drop in the prices of sugar stocks. On the BSE, Balrampur Chini fell 3.38 per cent, or Rs 2.60, to close at Rs 74.30 while Bajaj Hindusthan plunged 4.99 per cent, or Rs 1.50, to close at Rs 28.55. Similarly, Upper Ganges Sugar amp; Industries Ltd dipped by 3.65 per cent to close at Rs 79.10.

 In the meantime, the government is planning to raise the sugar buffer stock to five million tonnes from two million tonnes to check a steep fall in prices, said agriculture minister Sharad Pawar.

 On wheat imports, Pawar said it was unlikely that a new wheat tender would be floated and it might only be to create a buffer stock.

 Food and public distribution secretary T. Nanda Kumar said the government might cut duty on edible oils to tame prices.

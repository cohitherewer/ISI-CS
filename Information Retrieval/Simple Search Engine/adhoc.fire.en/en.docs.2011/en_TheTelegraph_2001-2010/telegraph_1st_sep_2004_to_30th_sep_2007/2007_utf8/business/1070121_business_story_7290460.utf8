 Motorola to lay off 3,500

 Ed Zander: On a new journey

 New York, Jan. 20 (Reuters): Motorola Inc said on Friday it plans to cut 3,500 jobs and save $400 million. The company aims at recovering a double-digit percentage level in its operating margin in the second half of 2007. 

 Motorola shares rose 3 per cent after executives outlined the plan and said revenue estimates for 2007 could beat Wall Street forecast. Investors were happy that Motorola has recovery in sight, after it reported earlier on Friday a 48 per cent drop in fourth quarter profit, hurt by lower phone prices. 

 But despite the rise in share prices, many analysts said they would hold their applause until they see Motorolas new products. 

 I think youre seeing a little relief that things arent getting worse, that they think they can fix it, said Benjamin Halliburton, chief investment officer of Tradition Capital Management, which has 220,000 Motorola shares and 281,000 Nokia shares among its $450-million assets. 

 Motorola said it would cut its workforce by 5 per cent globally, including the middle management. Along with the job cuts, Motorola said it expects to reduce the cost of making phones. 

 Our goal is to return to double-digit operating margins in the second half of this year, chief executive Ed Zander said during a Webcast of an analysts conference. 

 Chief financial officer David Devonshire forecast 2007 sales of $46 billion to $49 billion, compared with 2006 revenue of $42.88 billion and average analyst estimates for $46.09 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. 

 He forecast 2007 earnings per share the same as or slightly above 2006 earnings of $1.13 per share, and said the forecast includes stock-based compensation expenses of 7 cents a share. Analysts expected 2007 earnings of $1.18 per share, excluding unusual items.

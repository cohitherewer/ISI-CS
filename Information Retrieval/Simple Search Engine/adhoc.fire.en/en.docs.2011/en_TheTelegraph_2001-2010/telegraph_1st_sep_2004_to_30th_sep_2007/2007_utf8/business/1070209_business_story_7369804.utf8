 Getz variants on way

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Lheem: Big plans

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: Hyundai Motor India has given a facelift to Getz and will launch the petrol version in the country in the second quarter of this calendar. It is likely to introduce the diesel variant in the third quarter. Both the variants will take on Suzukis Swift. The Indian subsidiary of the Korean automaker also plans to double its exports by 2008.

 The company plans to export both petrol and diesel variants of the new Getz to Europe by mid-March, said H.S. Lheem, managing director and CEO of Hyundai Motor India.

 We will export about 50,000 vehicles of the new Getz to Europe in March. The second quarter will see the petrol variant in India and probably in the third quarter, the all-new diesel will also hit the Indian roads, he said.

 Sources say the Getz diesel will have a 1.1 or 1.2-litre engine and conform to the small car definition. The current Getz is powered by a 1.3-litre petrol engine, which is bigger than the 1,200 cc configuration mandated by the government to qualify for the concessional excise of 16 per cent.

 The new Getz was supposed to be an export model. Hyundai Motor Corporation had decided to move the production line of the Getz exclusively to India this year. At present, it is being produced both in Korea and India.

 Car size row

 Lheem has met heavy industries 

 minister Santosh Mohan Dev and expressed concern on the 

 lack of consistency in government policy on 

 the definition of a small car. Lheem sought a grace period 

 of two years for the industry to adapt to any policy change.

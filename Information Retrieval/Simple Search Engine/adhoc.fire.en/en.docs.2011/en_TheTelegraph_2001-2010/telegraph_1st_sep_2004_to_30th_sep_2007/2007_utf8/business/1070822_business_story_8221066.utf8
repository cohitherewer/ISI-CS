 Trai talks tough on repair levy

 JAYATI GHOSE

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) may have left mobile tariffs at the mercy of market forces but has raised an objection to extra charges on repair of faults in landline phones and broadband services.

 Mobile tariffs fall under forbearance, whereby operators or market forces have the freedom to fix tariffs. The recent hike in tariffs of SMS and local calls is not a consumer-friendly measure, but there is no scope for intervention as long as there is forbearance, Nripendra Misra, chairman of Trai, said.

 Recently, some GSM players hiked local SMS, local call and STD charges by 20 per cent. 

 However, charging consumers for repair of defects in fixed line and broadband services is not justified and cannot be allowed, said Misra. 

 Bharti Airtel had sent a tariff report to Trai proposing additional charges for repairing defects in fixed lines and broadband services. However, the regulator has held such tariff packages as not being consumer-friendly.

 Customers do not choose the quality of material being used in the network and are not responsible for the bad workmanship in cable or telephone instruments. They also have no say in determining the quality of the network. So, why should they be penalised for faults in such products and services, said Trai officials.

 Trai has asked Bharti Airtel to refund any charge levied for repairing work. 

 Bharti Airtel has been given a weeks time to report compliance. In an official statement, the company said, At times, we are requested by customers to attend to problems and defects which are not related to the network and are not part of the standard service bouquet such as PC reconfiguration, internal extension of wiring and damage because of movement. We are happy to provide these services on an optional basis and at a nominal cost. These charges have been duly notified to the regulator.

 Trai will soon issue guidelines to all service providers on the issue.

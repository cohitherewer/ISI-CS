 Bengal tops tea PF dues list

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

Calcutta, March 4: Bengals closed tea gardens have to clear dues worth Rs 128.61 crore. The states financial liabilities are the highest, followed by Kerala at Rs 89.86 crore.

 The financial liabilities include provident fund dues, bank loans and Tea Board loans.

 The commerce ministry had asked state governments for a list of provident fund defaulters, including that of closed gardens, as this would be an essential criterion to qualify for application under the special purpose tea fund.

 The state government has provided us with the list of defaulters. Unless the statutory dues are cleared, no garden will be covered under the fund, Jairam Ramesh, minister of state for commerce and industry, said.

 There are about 16 closed tea gardens in Bengal. The state government, along with the Tea Board, has been exploring various options to revive the gardens, including alternative revenue streams such as tea tourism and multi-cropping models.

 The bank loan dues in Bengal are the highest at Rs 113.93 crore, while for Kerala, it is Rs 52.31 crore. 

 The states provident fund dues stand at Rs 11.65 crore against Rs 36.65 crore in Kerala.

 Most of these tea gardens are mired in legal problems. The state government needs to incentivise the private sector to take up closed and sick gardens and revive them by solving issues such as high rates of salaami, availability of land deeds and titles, said an industry expert.

 The Union commerce ministry had earlier proposed to take up two closed gardens each in Bengal, Kerala and Assam. It planned to revive them through new management mechanisms, such as womens self-help groups or the workers cooperative system as started by Tata Tea, with assistance from financial institutions and Nabard.

 It is difficult to go ahead with the projects as each closed garden is neck deep in debts. Besides, no compliance to statutory regulations and different trade unions add to the problem, a Tea Board official said.

 The garden owners have always complained about the high social costs involved in production, which makes Indian tea lose out on price competitiveness.

 The budget has not done anything about the high labour cost in the tea sector, which is one of the largest employment generator in the country. Moreover, most of the workers in remote areas are women, said Deepak Khaitan, vice-chairman, McLeod Russel India Ltd.

 Steel players happy with ore export levy

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Spring in the step

Calcutta, Feb. 28: Steel industry has been clamouring for it long. They received support from political heavyweights like Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee too.

 Even as finance minister did not meet their demand for banning iron ore export, he made a beginning.

 Chidambaram imposed a duty of Rs 300 per tonne to be levied on export of iron ores and concentrates and Rs 2,000 per tonne on export of chrome ores and concentrates.

 Commenting on the budget, S.K. Rungta, chairman of the Steel Authority of India (SAIL), said government has rightly recognised the need to conserve mineral wealth, especially iron ore, for value addition within the country. 

 In this context, levy of export duty on iron ore and concentrates is timely, he said.

 Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman, however, felt the budget was neutral to the steel industry.

 Restricting export volume could have been considered too, he said adding the introduction of export duty on iron ore and chrome ore was a very welcome move and it would have long-term benefit for the country. 

 While no one has commented on how this move may impact the domestic prices of steel, industry observers feel it may increase availability of iron ore in the domestic market. Steel companies, who buy from the market, may be able to negotiate a better prices. If the benefit is passed on, one can think of some moderation, a steel industry executive said. 

 This may incentivise growth of steel industry which is facing problems in getting captive iron ore mines. 

 This may, particularly help projects such as JSW Steels Bengal project, where the company is buying iron from market without depending on captive mines.

 India exports about 90 million tonne of iron ore, most of which is fines (dust). Only about 10 million tonne is high-grade lump.

 Internationally, iron ore prices are set to increase by 9 per cent this year. Experts feel that Indian export of iron ore will become less competitive in the international market.

 Given the basic price of low-grade iron ore at $50 a tonne, the $7 (Rs 300) increase will make Indian import by 24 per cent. In case of lump, this percentile increase would not be much. The industry is also happy for the fact that FM has removed import duty on all coking coals, irrespective of ash content.

 So far, high-grade coking coal was duty free. But coking coal with 12 per cent ash content was attracting 5 per cent duty. Indian domestic coking coal production hardly meets domestic demand. Steel industry depends on imported coal from Australia and Indonesia.

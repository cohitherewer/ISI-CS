 Steps to keep Dabhol in fine health

 Mumbai, June 27: The Centre is tossing a melange of options to ensure the long-term viability of the beleaguered Dabhol power project, which is expected to be revived this August.

 Ratnagiri Gas and Power Project Ltd (RGPPL) a joint venture between GAIL (India), the National Thermal Power Corporation, a group of lenders led by the IDBI, and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board now owns the assets that were created by the collapsed utility giant Enron Corporation back in the nineties. RGPPL is spooked by the huge debt burden it is taking on to crank up the project once again.

 Last month, a high-powered meeting of secretaries representing the Centre and the Maharashtra government, and various stakeholders in the project came up with three clear options to get the project going.

 The objective is to ensure an acceptable debt servicing coverage ratio (DSCR) basically a broad metric that measures whether the utility will generate sufficient revenues to pay back its debts over time. The various alternatives being tossed around crucially hinge on the ability to hive off the liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility.

 A major objective behind these proposals is to ensure that the financial institutions, which have huge loan exposures to the project, are not affected in any way. 

 Moreover, the government is keen to ensure that tariffs remain as reasonable as possible and do not exceed Rs 2.85 to Rs 2.95 per unit. The general perception was that the DSCR would remain at an unacceptable level even after the lenders agreed to waive Rs 465 crore in interest.

 The first option was that close to 30 per cent of power generated from the project be sold at market rates and the LNG facility hived off to bring down the debt burden.

 The second option was that if the LNG facility could not be hived off, then the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Commission (MSEDCL) the distribution arm created after unbundling the state power utility could consider increasing the capacity charge by about 15 paise for the stipulated period. A capacity charge is a fixed charge paid by consumers, irrespective of the number of units bought. 

 The third option was if power could not be sold at market rates and the LNG facility was divested, MSEDCL would have to increase the capacity charge by 8 paise in 2007-08, 4 paise in 2009-10 and 3 paise in 2010-2011 and 2011-2012.

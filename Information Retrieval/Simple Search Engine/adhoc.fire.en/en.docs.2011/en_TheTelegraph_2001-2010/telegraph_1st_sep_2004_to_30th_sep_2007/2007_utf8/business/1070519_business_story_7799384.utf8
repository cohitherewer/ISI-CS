 Rate of inflation eases to 5.44%

 OUR BUREAU 

 New Delhi, May 18: The rate of inflation fell for the third consecutive week to an over four-month low of 5.44 per cent in the week ended May 5. It was at 5.66 per cent in the previous week.

 Wholesale prices-based inflation had stood at 4.37 per cent in the corresponding week of the previous year.

 During the week, prices of sooji, sugar, flour, moong, barley, condiments and spices declined, while imported edible oil and salt got dearer. There was also a marginal rise in the prices of cement, jet fuel and naphtha. Admitting that spiralling prices of essential goods were a cause for concern, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said his government would further bring down inflation to 5 per cent in a couple of months.

 The inflation rate is 5.5 per cent now and we will bring it down to 5 per cent. I hope we will succeed on this front in the next couple of months, he said. There is concern about prices. We will moderate it. It is already coming down. 

 As the UPA government completes its third year in office, the official data on inflation released today will give some respite to the ruling coalition, which drew flak from the Opposition and some allies over the rising prices.

 The decline in inflation will ease the pressure on the Reserve Bank to take any monetary tightening measures after refraining from them in its annual policy. However, there could be some more fiscal sops. This was indicated by finance minister P. Chidambaram in the Lok Sabha yesterday.

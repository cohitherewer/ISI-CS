 Jute bag packaging extended for a year

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: The government today extended the compulsory packaging of foodgrain and sugar in jute bags till June 30, 2008.

 Between July and June next year, foodgrain and sugar will have to be packed in jute bags, with some exceptions, said finance minister P. Chidambaram after a meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA).

 Chidambaram said consumer packs of 25 kg and below and export packings will be exempted from the rule. Moreover, packs of 100kg or more and those for sugar fortified with vitamins will also be outside the purview of the compulsory packaging norm.

 Sanjay Kajaria, chairman of the Indian Jute Mills Association, has assured timely delivery to the Food Corporation of India and other state procurement agencies and private sector sugar bodies.

 In case of disruption in jute supplies, the textile ministry will authorise user agencies to relax these provisions up to a maximum of 20 per cent for sugar and foodgrain.

 The CCEAs decision is part of the implementation of the Jute Packaging Material Act, 1987 and National Jute Policy, 2005.

 Aircraft bill

 The government will introduce a comprehensive bill in the Rajya Sabha during the monsoon session of Parliament to amend the Aircraft Act of 1934.

 The bill will give greater power to the directorate general of civil aviation, streamline aviation safety and security functions and ensure technical standards of airports and air traffic control, Union information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said after a meeting of the cabinet today .

 The legislation is expected to bring the aircraft act in line with the latest developments in the aviation sector.

 Profits under pressure

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 9: The decision of domestic cement manufacturers not to raise prices for a year is seen as a major negative as it could impact their profitability. Even as input prices are expected to go up, it is felt that the industrys flexibility to raise prices after one year will be reduced as new capacities are expected to be created. 

 For the industry, such a double whammy comes at a time when observers are gung-ho about its growth prospects with demand for the commodity growing at a brisk pace. After witnessing sluggish single-digit demand rates for many years, cement has been currently witnessing a double-digit growth of around 10 per cent. 

 Analysts had, therefore, factored in the change in demand pattern and remained buoyant about the sectors earning prospects. Cement prices were expected to jump by around 35 per cent during this year. 

 However, developments of the past few days commencing with the Union Budget 2007-08 has led to many analysts pruning their positive outlook on the sector. The trend only got intensified today with the industry committing to the government that they will not raise prices for one year even if input costs go up. 

 Certain input costs may go up and if they do, the manufacturers will have to absorb them. Even if the increases are minimal, it will impact their margins going forward. This will happen even if the demand-supply situation is in favour of the industry, an analyst with a local brokerage felt. He added that benefits of any excise duty reduction would also not be significant as the manufacturers will have to pass such benefits to its consumers. 

 Moreover, with import duties on the commodity brought to nil, the gap between landed costs and domestic prices would also shrink. In a recent report on the sector, Edelweiss downgraded the industry, citing risk to its earnings estimates on account of government intervention. 

 Quite predictably in the stock market, almost all cement shares got clobbered today. On the BSE, Grasim Industries slumped by Rs 166 to Rs 2,069.15, ACC by Rs 52.50 to Rs 780.85, Gujarat Ambuja Cements by Rs 2.95 to Rs 109.95 and UltraTech by Rs 38.95 to Rs 779.50.

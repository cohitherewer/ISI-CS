 Biyani: Ambitious plans

 Calcutta, Sept. 16: Future Group will raise Rs 2,000 crore through an initial public offering of a new company.

 We are looking at a new company for the issue. We plan to raise around Rs 2,000 crore. I cannot reveal anything else now, said Kishore Biyani, chief executive officer of Future Group, who was in the city. 

 The announcement came right after the Future Group board approved an IPO of its financial arm, Future Capital Holdings. 

 We will work out the modalities in a few weeks and are aiming to launch the issue in December or January, though it could take longer than that, Biyani added. 

 Future Capitals issue size is yet to be decided. 

 However, UBS Investments has valued the company at Rs 3,000 crore. 

 When asked about the huge size of the planned issue, Biyani said, We are looking at democratising distribution of equity. 

 Biyani refused to name the company but ruled out the likes of Future Media and Future Bazaar. 

 Future Media is Pantaloons outdoor media subsidiary and Future Bazaar is an online retail subsidiary. 

 The company is looking at a 10 to 15 per cent dilution in Future Bazaar through a private placement. 

 Earlier, the management had said the unlocking of value for the shareholders through subsidiaries could include Home Solutions Retail (India) Ltd, the home improvement and consumer electronics retailing subsidiary of Pantaloon Retail (India). 

 With Biyani announcing that the funds will be raised through a new company, the possibility of an issue for Home Solutions is ruled out.

 Pantaloon is the flagship company of Biyanis Future Group. The company is expected to clock a turnover of Rs 30,000 crore by 2010. Pantaloon is involved in retail, capital brands, space, media and logistics businesses. 

 Pantaloon Industries and Pantaloon Retail (India) are both listed entities.

 The group plans to invest in the logistics business and will reportedly raise $500 million to fund its plans. 

 Biyani, speaking about his retail expansion plan, said Pantaloon planned to expand its small retail format to sell to the urban poor.

 I want to increase the retail outlets for the urban poor, Biyani said.

 The group has several retail formats including Pantaloons, supermarket Big Bazaar and specialty store Central.

 Biyani said he would launch the Central brand in Calcutta soon. The group has already identified the location for the store.

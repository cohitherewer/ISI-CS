 Ambani: Making a move

 New Delhi, July 10: Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), today met top government officials to explain the companys approach to the pricing of natural gas from the KG basin. 

 He had meetings with cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar and T.K.A. Nair, principal secretary to the Prime Minister. 

 Earlier in the day, Ambani discussed the impact of gas price on subsidies with expenditure secretary Sanjiv Misra.

 He said the natural gas from Reliances KG-D6 block can help reduce the fertiliser subsidy. This will happen if fertiliser companies replace the costlier naphtha and fuel with gas for use as feedstock. 

 Sources said he also put forth arguments in favour of RILs pricing formula. 

 The company has priced the gas at at $4.33 per mbtu. 

 RILs gas pricing has been opposed by power and fertiliser ministries and also by Anil Ambani. 

 Mukesh met Nair to explain the way his firm arrived at the gas price and how attempts to regulate it would dampen investments in the oil and gas hunt.

 On July 6, the power ministry made a presentation to the committee of secretaries, demanding gas at affordable prices for power plants.

 Mittal FDI proposal shot down 

 New Delhi, June 8 (PTI): L.N. Mittals plan to pick up a 49 per cent stake in state-run HPCLs Bhatinda refinery has hit a roadblock with the Foreign Investment Promotion Board rejecting the proposal today.

 The FIPB noted that the country needs more foreign direct investment in oil refining. But since under the present policy, foreign direct investment in public sector refineries cannot go beyond 26 per cent, a decision was deferred, sources said.

 Mittal, through his UK-based subsidiary Mittal Investments, had sought FIPB clearance to invest Rs 3,506 crore for a 49 per cent stake in the Rs 17,983-crore refinery. The HPCL-Mittal combine will now have to wait until the government reviews the FDI policy.

 Pepsico appeal 

 The FIPB today deferred a decision on beverages firm Pepsicos application, seeking exemption from regulations to divest a 49 per cent stake in its bottling arms to Indian shareholders.

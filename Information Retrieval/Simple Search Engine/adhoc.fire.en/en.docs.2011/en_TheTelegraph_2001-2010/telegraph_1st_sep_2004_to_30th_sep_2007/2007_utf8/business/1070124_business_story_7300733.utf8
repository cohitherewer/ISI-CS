 Universal Cables forges pact with Japanese firm

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 23: Universal Cables Ltd, an MP Birla Group company, is ramping up its value-added product portfolio to cash in on the high-voltage power cable business. 

 The company today signed a technical agreement with Japan rsquo;s Furukawa Electric Company to manufacture extra high-voltage power cables, up to 400 kilovolt, from its plant at Satna in Madhya Pradesh.

 Under the pact, Furukawa Electric will 

 provide Universal Cable with the technical knowhow on underground high-voltage power 

 cable system and extra high-voltage cable 

 production.

 ldquo;The cables will be manufactured under vertical continuous vulcanisation process over a 106 metre tall tower. Traditionally, cables are manufactured horizontally, rdquo; said Pankaj Kalani, company secretary of Universal Cables Ltd. ldquo;The machines have been installed and production will start from February, rdquo; he said. 

 In September, the company had merged Optic Fibre Goa Ltd mdash; a joint venture between Vindhya Telelinks and Birla Ericsson Optical Ltd mdash; with itself and entered into optical fibre cable production. Following that, it made a capital expenditure of Rs 85 crore, of which Rs 64 crore went into setting up the extra high-voltage power cable plant at Satna and Rs 21 crore was spent on upgrading the existing plant and machinery. 

 ldquo;We expect a revenue of more than Rs 200 crore in three years from this new line, rdquo; said Kalani. ldquo;EHV power cables are sold on the basis of tenders floated by state electricity boards and other power distribution agencies, rdquo; he explained.

 Universal Cables, which has been manufacturing power cables of up to 132 kv, is banking on the new product given the government rsquo;s emphasis on the power sector. ldquo;The company will be perfectly positioned to tap the emerging business opportunities in the high-voltage power transmission sector, rdquo; Kalani said.

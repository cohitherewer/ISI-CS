 Firms vie for broadband pie

 New Delhi, July 8: Telecom firms and Internet service providers are betting big on the broadband market.

 Sify Ltd, which supplies broadband through cable TV, provides online educational content. Reliance Communications and Bharti Airtel are focusing on satellite-based broadband and direct-to-home (DTH) TV. 

 High-speed Internet services and broadband connections are yet to gain a firm footing in this country, although the department of telecom calls 2007 the year of broadband.

 The broadband penetration rate in India stands at a dismal 3.5 per cent. Moreover, this is mostly limited to urban areas. The rural market is completely untapped, said a senior DoT official.

 According to the latest data available with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, the country had 2.46 million broadband connections at the end of May.

 India is a value-for-money market. By providing educational contents, such as study materials and math courses for children, we are trying to change the perception about broadband which people associate with chats and games thereby increasing demand, said Naresh Ajwani, president consumer operations, Sify Limited. 

 Bharti Airtel and Reliance have decided to club their broadband and digital TV services.

 A combined offering of DTH and satellite Internet is economically viable. Standalone satellite Internet services are expensive as they require a satellite dish for two-way data communication, said a Reliance spokesperson.

 Satellite Internet is the ideal solution for rural users, who want broadband services but do not have access to landline telephones and cable TV. 

 Many in the industry are betting big on WiMax a long-range radio network technology to spur broadband usage. However, most players will deploy broadband through WiMax only after the current spectrum crunch has abated.

 Analysts said the WiMax technology would increase the demand for broadband in areas which did not have the required infrastructure. 

 Trai chairman Nipendra Misra expects WiMax to become a standard technology in six months.

 A digital subscriber line is the dominant mode of delivery. It uses the network of phone cables already laid across the country.

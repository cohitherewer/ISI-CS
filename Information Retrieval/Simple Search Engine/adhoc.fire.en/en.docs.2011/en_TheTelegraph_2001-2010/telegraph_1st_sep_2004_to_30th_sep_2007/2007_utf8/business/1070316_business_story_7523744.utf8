 Areva tops Suzlon offer for REpower

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 15: Suzlon Energys bid to gain control over REpower Systems, the German wind turbine manufacturer, suffered a setback today with French company Areva SA raising its bid price to 140 euros per share. Areva is the major shareholder of REpower.

 This price is 11 per cent more than the 126 euros a share offered by Suzlon. 

 The new Areva bid price represents a 6.3 per cent premium on REpowers closing share price.

 Areva said its offer was valid till April 20 and that it was subject to further revision. The French company now holds around 30 per cent in REpower Systems.

 Market observers do not rule out the possibility of Suzlon hiking the offer price to at least 145 euros per share. 

 It may be recalled that Suzlon had earlier joined hands with Martifer Group, the second largest shareholder in REpower. Martifer holds around 25.4 per cent stake in the German company. 

 Suzlon and Martifer had formed a joint venture company called Suzlon Windenergie GmbH, through which the acquisition would be effected. 

 In February, Suzlon made a cash offer of 126 euros per share to REpower shareholders. The price represented a premium of 20 per cent over that offered by Areva. 

 While Martifer has a joint venture with REpower in Portugal, Suzlon and Martifer entered into a legally binding agreement, which set out the terms for the offer. 

 Part of the agreement was that Suzlon will finance the offer and Martifer will support it. 

 Yes Bank and ABN Amro were appointed as joint financial advisers of Suzlon. 

 Suzlon Energy had received approval from the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) for its offer to acquire REpower.

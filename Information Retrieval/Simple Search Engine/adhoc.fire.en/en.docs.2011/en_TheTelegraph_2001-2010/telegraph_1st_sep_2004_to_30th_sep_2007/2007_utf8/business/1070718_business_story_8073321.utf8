 New norms for firms issuing IDRs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 17: The Centre today issued new rules for foreign companies raising money from local markets through the issue of Indian depository receipts (IDRs).

 Eligibility conditions will now be based on ceilings relating to net worth and market capitalisation. Previously, the ceilings were based on net worth and turnover.

 The move comes just a day after the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council raised concerns over the excessive capital inflows into the country and advised measures to facilitate the reverse flow of money.

 A new eligibility condition says the issuer company should have a continuous trading record on a stock exchange in the parent country for at least three immediately preceding years.

 However, the condition requiring the issuer to be making profits for at least five preceding years has been relaxed. The issuer is now required to distribute profits as dividends in three out of the immediately preceding five years.

 The number of underlying equity shares shall not exceed 25 per cent of the total shares after the issue.

 Previously, companies were allowed to raise funds up to 15 per cent of their paid-up capital and free reserves.

 Market regulator Sebi will now be required to grant approval to IDR applications in a time-bound manner.

 The new rules were issued today by the ministry of corporate affairs.

 Officials said they expected infotech companies, including BPOs, and private equity firms to issue IDRs.

 Standard Life beats forecasts 

 London, Sept. 4 (Reuters): Standard Life beat forecasts today with a 71 per cent rise in first-half operating profit. However, policy lapses remained above its long-term assumptions as customers continued to cash in policies early.

 Standard Life, which got listed last year after scrapping its mutual status, posted an operating profit before tax of 353 million against 206 million a year ago and well above an average forecast of 318 million.

 The contribution from new business rose 66 per cent to 151 million. 

 Overall, the results are perfectly solid. Its pretty much in line with what people were expecting, analyst Peter Eliot of MF Global said.

 Standard Life, which last month reported a 31 per cent jump in first-half sales, had said it expected a significant increase in margins, helped by increased capital efficiency and its shift to more lucrative products, including its key self-invested personal pension, which allows customers to take their own investment decisions but carries higher fees.

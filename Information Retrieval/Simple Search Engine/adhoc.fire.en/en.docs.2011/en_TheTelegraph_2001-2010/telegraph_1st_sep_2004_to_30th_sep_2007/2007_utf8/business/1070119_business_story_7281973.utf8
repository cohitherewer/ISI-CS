 Bill on microfinance on way

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: The government would soon table a bill on microfinance to speed up the flow of credit to the poor and small enterprises, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said here today.

 We are working on a bill for microfinance institutions to help create a friendly policy environment for microfinance services, Singh said at the inaugural function of a conference of South Asian home-based workers. The bill will be introduced in the budget session.

 Singh said microfinance was a vital instrument for the poor and tiny enterprises. He said the potential size of the market was 250 million people or 75 million households 60 million rural and 15 million urban. 

 These (microfinance institutions) must reach the poor in far greater numbers and build their capabilities to absorb higher amount of credit, Singh said.

 The Prime Minister said the government would promote different models to spread microfinance rapidly.

 Finance ministry joint secretary (banking) Amitabh Verma said, The bill is aimed at putting in place stricter regulations for institutions engaged in deposit and lending of funds, and minimum regulations for others engaged in offering only lending services at the micro level. 

 Verma said the sector would be regulated by Nabard, which would frame rules on credit adequacy and other norms. Under the microfinance schemes, over Rs 20,000 crore has been disbursed to 46 lakh self-help groups (SHGs), with about Rs 12,500 crore to 23 lakh SHGs of banks and microfinance institutions (MFI) and about Rs 8,000 crore to the 23 lakh SHGs under the Swarna Jayanti Rozgar Yojana.

 Verma said there would be no ceiling on the interest rate, though there were pressures for such a cap to prevent foreign financial institutions exploiting the poor.

 However, the bill has a provision to safeguard deposits of SHG members along with penalty on microfinance institutions. Barring SHGs, registration was mandatory for all financial institutions, societies and microfinance institutions. 

 The bill also aims at promoting competition among the microfinance providers which are expected to lower the lending rates.

 Verma said the bill would have a provision of registration for private money lenders as a small credit lending entity. The money lenders were regulated by the state laws, Verma added.

 Drug punch to counter US pinch

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 27: Indian pharmaceutical companies have joined hands to fight allegations in the US about the poor quality of drugs from the country.

 Senior US drug industry officials have warned that medicines from India and China could be risky. 

 Exporters plan to mobilise support through diplomatic channels for their case. According to them, Indian drugs are on a par with products made in the US.

 D.G. Shah, secretary-general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, said pharmaceutical companies conformed to the norms of the US Food and Drugs Administration (USFDA). 

 The US regulatory bodies and the medical profession have no problems with our products. I am, therefore, surprised as to why the US Bulk Pharmaceuticals Task Force is shouting from the roof top against our medicines, Shah said.

 A Ranbaxy spokesperson, however, refused to comment on the issue. Another major bulk drug exporter said the accusation was not valid. He added, The Indian production system is on a par with global standards. We have the best possible manufacturing facilities and some of them have been approved by the USFDA.

 Almost 20 per cent of finished generics and over-the-counter drugs and more than 40 per cent of the active ingredients for pills made in the US are from India and China. Within 15 years, it is predicted that 80 per cent of the key ingredients will come from these two Asian countries. India has over 80 plants approved by the USFDA, which is the second highest in the world.

 Experts feel that the reason behind the concern over Indian bulk drugs is commercial. India ranks fourth in volume among the top 15 drug manufacturing countries worldwide. Indian companies have developed cost-effective technologies in bulk drugs and intermediates, which meet global standards. 

 Gajanan Wakankar, executive director of the Indian Drug Manufacturers Association, said: Let them point out which company or consignment has not met international standards. It is absolutely unfair on their part to make such blanket statements about our drugs.

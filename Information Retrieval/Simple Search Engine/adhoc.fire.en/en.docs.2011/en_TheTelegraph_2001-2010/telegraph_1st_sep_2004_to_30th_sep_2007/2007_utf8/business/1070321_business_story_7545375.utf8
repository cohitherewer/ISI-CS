 Credit Suisse makes a comeback

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, March 20: Credit Suisse today re-activated its brokerage operations in the country.

 Way back in 2001, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had suspended the Zurich-based financial services firm from market operations for its alleged role in price manipulation. Though the ban was lifted in 2003, Credit Suisse chose a step-by-step approach to gain foothold in India.

 In 2005, it opened a financial consultancy and advisory office in Mumbai to boost its wealth management business. The firm also made some senior-level appointments while Mihir Doshi was made the country head, Nilesh Jasani became the head of research and V. Anantharaman was chosen to lead the investment banking team.

 Last year, it set up a centre of excellence in Pune to provide technology support and front-office analysis to support its businesses across 50 countries.

 Credit Suisse now plans to offer its complete suite of investment banking, asset management and private banking services in India. 

 The Zurich-based firm holds a broker-dealer licence for Bombay and and National stock exchanges. The focus will be on equity sales and trading and research in India.

 Paul Catello, chief executive officer of Credit Suisse in Asia-Pacific, said India is one of its most important growth markets in the region and the company is optimistic of securing a strong position in the country. India, he added, has shown strong growth not only in primary issues but also in mergers and acquisitions.

 Credit Suisse sees a 10 per cent growth in Indian economy during 2007-08 on the back of strong investment spending. It is, therefore, planning to offer other services as well. Over the long term, Credit Suisse will deliver its full range of services that include private banking and asset management, Catello said.

 Doshi said Credit Suisse has already applied for a licence to start investment banking activities in the country. The company, in association with GE, has also launched a fund dedicated to infrastructure. This fund will invest in India apart from other economies. It has also made investments in the countrys real estate through an overseas fund.

 While Credit Suisse has no plans to enter the retail brokerage business, Catello said it would not rope in a joint venture partner in its investment banking and brokerage business. However, he did not rule out the possibility of a partner in asset management as is the case in China or South Korea.

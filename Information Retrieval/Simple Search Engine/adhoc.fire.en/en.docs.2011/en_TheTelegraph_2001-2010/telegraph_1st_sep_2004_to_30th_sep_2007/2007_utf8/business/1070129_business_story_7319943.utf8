 All eyes on RBI price plan

 NUMBERS GAME 

 Many analysts and bankers expect both repo and 

reverse repo rates to be raised by 25 basis points each

 Analysts do not see change in the cash reserve ratio

 Few aver that the RBI governor is 

unlikely to raise the repo rate

 Mumbai, Jan. 28: Will Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Y.V. Reddy go the whole hog against inflation? Thats the question doing the rounds with just two days to go for the third-quarter review of the monetary policy. As the rate of inflation remains firm, all eyes are on whether Reddy will raise both reverse repo and repo rates or tinker with only the former.

 The current mood in the banking system, however, is of Reddy adopting an aggressive approach to contain inflation within the range of 5.0-5.5 per cent as projected by the central bank for the fiscal-end. Many analysts and bankers feel that the RBI governor will raise both the rates by 25 basis points each on January 31.

 They have reasons to believe so. While inflation has risen considerably in the past few days (it recently hit a two-year high), demand for funds from banks continue to be strong. Though inflation dipped to 5.95 per cent for the week ended January 13, observers feel it is likely to remain firm in the short-run.

 The growth in money supply too has crossed the central banks comfort level. Bankers said Union finance minister P. Chidambarams recent statement that the rise in inflation was indeed a matter of concern would help the RBI governors cause to take steps against inflationary expectations.

 The repo rate now stands at 7.25 per cent and reverse repo at 6 per cent. The repo is the short-term rate at which the RBI lends funds to banks and reverse repo is the rate through which it mops up surplus cash from the system. 

 The RBI raised the repo rate four times last year to control credit growth and inflation. It also increased the cash reserve ratio (CRR) the portion of deposits which banks must maintain with the RBI from 5 per cent to 5.50 per cent. Analysts do not expect Reddy to alter the CRR.

 The RBI will not touch the CRR as the effect of the recent hike is still weighing on the market. Though the government has taken certain measures to control inflation, which could to some extent moderate the supply shock in the system, the major contributor continues to be manufactured product prices. Given that there is an excess demand in the economy, Reddy will hike both repo and reverse repo rates, said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist, Bank of Baroda (BoB).

 Though interest rates are expected to rise following a hike in these short-term rates, there are few who aver that Reddy is unlikely to raise the repo rate. In his previous monetary policy, the RBI governor had left the reverse repo rate untouched even as he increased the repo rate by 25 basis points. 

 After all these hikes, the RBI governor will not want to hamper the growth story. This is the busy time of the year for banks and only recently they were subject to a surprise 50-basis-point hike in the CRR. Moreover, the rise in inflation is only seen as a short-term phenomenon. Therefore, Reddy will only raise one of these rates, a banker said.

 Govt drops fuel price hike hint

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 On the boil

 New Delhi, July 25: The government today said a hike in petrol and diesel prices might be unavoidable.

 Petroleum minister Murli Deora said while the government had so far kept retail prices unchanged, it might not be able to do so for long. We are trying very hard to see that prices are not increased (but) I cannot say if they will never be raised, Deora said.

 The minister said the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) were losing Rs 195 crore daily by selling petrol, diesel, domestic cooking gas (LPG) and kerosene below the cost price.

 I dont know how long we can sustain this, he said.

 To avoid a price hike, Deora said he had held discussions with finance minister P. Chidambaram on fiscal measures to ease the burden on oil companies.

 The petroleum ministry wants at least one-third of the projected Rs 55,000-crore under-realisation on fuel sale this fiscal be met through the issue of oil bonds. An equivalent amount will be contributed by upstream firms such as ONGC and GAIL India.

 Deora said measures such as reducing excise duty and shifting from ad-valorem to fixed rates would also protect the oil PSUs from rising international oil prices.

 No decision has yet been taken and consultations will continue, he said, adding that he had briefed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh about the situation and was also in touch with the leaders of Left parties.

 In February, petrol and diesel prices were cut by Rs 2 a litre and Re 1 a litre respectively. However, global oil prices have appreciated since then. The Indian basket of crude has averaged $72.31 per barrel this month, up 14 per cent from February.

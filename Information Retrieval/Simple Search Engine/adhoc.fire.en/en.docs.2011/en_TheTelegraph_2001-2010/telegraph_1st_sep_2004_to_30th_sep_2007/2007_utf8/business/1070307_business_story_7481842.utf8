 Calcutta, March 6: HP India is banking on new products and value additions to boost its market share in the notebook segment by 20 per cent from 38 per cent in the next 12 months.

 In India, HP has two main brands the Compaq Presario and the high-end HP Pavilion.

 The notebook or portable computer market in India is growing by 104 per cent year-on-year and the high-end models are doing equally well. In 2006, one million notebooks were sold. In future, HP also plans to grow in tandem with the market, said Nitin Hiranandani, country consumer sales manager, imaging amp; printing group, Hewlett Packard India Sales Pvt Ltd.

 Educational institutions, emerging wi-fi campuses and the SMB segment have contributed significantly in the notebook market. HP has ties with educational institutions and is focusing on SMBs.

 The company adds value to its notebooks by offering additional 80GB and 120GB media pocket drives for data storage with certain models.

 According to the IDC Q4 2006 tracker data, HP topped the list in the total notebook PC market with a 38 per cent market share in 2006 followed by Lenovo at 18 per cent and Toshiba at 10 per cent.

 Of HPs 38 per cent market share, Compaq notebooks constitute 19.5 per cent.

 Hiranandani said HPs market share of 16.7 per cent in consumer PCs is expected to go up to 25 per cent during the year.

 The year 2006 witnessed a 3 per cent growth in average selling values (ASVs) of desktops because of more people opting for LCD/TFT monitors and other accessories.

 According to IDCs outlook on the desktop and notebook segment for 2007, greater market traction is expected in the overall PC shipment, especially notebooks, as more IT vendors adopt new strategies for product retailing. The efforts will focus on wooing small office/home office (SOHO) and individual/home customers. Experiments will also be seen in retail formats, in-store and on-site promotions, product bundling and alternative payment options.

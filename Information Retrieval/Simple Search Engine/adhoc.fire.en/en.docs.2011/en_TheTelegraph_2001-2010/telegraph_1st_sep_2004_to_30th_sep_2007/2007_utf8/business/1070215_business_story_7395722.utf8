 Bank loans turn costlier

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 14: The first impact of the Reserve Banks CRR hike is here. Three nationalised banks Punjab National Bank (PNB), Bank of Baroda (BoB) and Bank of India (BoI) have raised their lending rates by half a percentage point. The hike will affect personal loans only. The banks have not touched their housing and car loan rates yet. Bankers, however, expect these rates to go up in the next few days. ICICI Bank, on the other hand, has ruled out an increase in its lending rates for now. 

 The axe has largely fallen on corporate borrowers. Sources said sub-PLR rates for highly-rated companies and interest on loans for other categories such as personal loans will be increased. While the prime lending rate (PLR) of PNB would go up from 11.75 per cent to 12.25 per cent, both BoB and BoI have raised their rates to 12.5 per cent from 12 per cent. The hikes will come into effect tomorrow. 

 Senior officials from these banks said the hike was necessary due to the 50-basis-point hike in the CRR by the RBI yesterday. The central bank had hiked the reserve ratio to 6 per cent to control inflation. The move will suck out Rs 14,000 crore from the banking system. It has been done to bring down the credit resources of banks, they added.

 One impact of this move is that credit growth, which has been hovering around 30 per cent, will come down. While interest rates will rise, it will also bring down credit to some sectors, an official from a nationalised bank said. He added that as liquidity of banks will get crimped, they will have to look at raising deposit rates as well in the coming days. 

 The official felt the move could hurt banks bottomlines as government security prices have declined and the sector does not get any interest on CRR balances that have to be maintained with the RBI. 

 Stocks slip

 As expected, the sensex went into a 285-point tailspin today, but the fall was restricted to 81 points at close, thanks to buying in metal stocks and blue-chips RIL and ONGC. Positive global markets also aided the recovery partly. The index closed at 14009.90, down 0.58 per cent from the previous session.

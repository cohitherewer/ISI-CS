 BSNL rethink on tender

 JAYATI GHOSE

 Raja: Getting strict

 New Delhi, July 9: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd may have to rework the tender for the 45.5 million GSM lines as the government has raised questions on price and eligibility issues.

 While BSNL is keen to go ahead with the deal, IT and communications minister A. Raja has insisted on a relook at the terms of the tender.

 Raja has suggested a financial re-bidding within a month with all the five bidders Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia, Siemens and ZTE. He also wants BSNL to finalise fresh technical specifications for the tender.

 A senior BSNL official said, We wish to award the deal as soon as possible without initiating another tender process. However, everything now depends on the decisions taken by the government.

 The minister has asked for a detailed report on the GSM tender along with an account of BSNLs capacity in each circle and the number of lines already exhausted.

 The government has asked for certain clarifications and we are providing the same, said the official, adding that a solution is expected soon.

 In a note to BSNL chairman A.K. Sinha, the minister not only advised the company to drop the 3G component from its Rs 27,000-crore cellular infrastructure contract but also questioned Motorolas disqualification from the tender process.

 Earlier, the minister stalled the execution of the contract by insisting that BSNL renegotiate the order rate with lowest bidder Ericsson.

 Raja said: It is surprising that Motorola, a global leader in telecommunications equipment and a firm that supplies 2G and 3G equipment to MTNL, could not qualify technically.

 Raja feels if Motorola can supply equipment to MTNL for a similar tender at $69 per line, why should another state-owned company pay extra. 

 Moreover, with the government yet to finalise the 3G policy, BSNL might consider restricting the technical specifications in the tender to 2G, the minister said.

 If BSNL takes the ministers advice, the public sector company may have to reconsider the disqualification of Motorola and its Chinese partner ZTE from the tender a quarter of which was for rolling out 3G lines.

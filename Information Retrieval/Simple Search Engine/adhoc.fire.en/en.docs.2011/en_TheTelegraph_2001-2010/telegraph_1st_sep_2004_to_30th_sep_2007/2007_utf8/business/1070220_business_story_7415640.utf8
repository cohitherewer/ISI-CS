 Fillip for Indo-Pak trade ties

 New Delhi, Feb. 19: Commerce minister Kamal Nath today met Hamid Yar Hiraj, Pakistans minister of state for commerce, to discuss ways to boost trade between the two countries.

 The talks, held in the shadow of the terrorist strike on Samjhauta Express, reflected the grit of the two neighbours attempting to build better co-operation.

 The Pakistani minister is leading a delegation of 187 businessmen from his country to forge better trade ties with India. 

 Nath said Indo-Pak trade had increased 129 per cent in the April-October period of the current fiscal to touch $789 million. This comprises exports to Pakistan, which are valued at $601.1 million, and imports from the neighbouring country worth $187.9 million. 

 Nath told the visiting delegation that Indias imports from Pakistan have been growing at a steady pace of 87 per cent in 2005-06, which has been sustained in the current fiscal.

 The two ministers are believed to have emphasised on the need to increase two-way trade and to promote economic and commercial cooperation within the framework of a composite dialogue.

 However, while India has accorded Pakistan the most favoured nation status for trade, Islamabad has refused to reciprocate the gesture.

 Unlike other signatories to the South Asia Free Trade Area (Safta) agreement that came into effect in January last year, with the tariff agreement being implemented from July 1, Pakistan has not allowed for a freer trade with India, which is preventing benefits from flowing both ways.

 Grotto will initially hold a 50 per cent stake in the new entity, named Gas Apparel. Thereafter, it proposes to dilute its stake to 26 per cent and the rest will be held by Simest, whose holding in the the joint venture will not exceed 24 per cent.

 The foreign investment will be made through equity and preference shares. 

 The Italian government holds 76 per cent stake in Simest, through which it promotes Italian companies overseas.

 Apart from cash amp; carry wholesale trading, the Grotto-Raymond venture will engage in sourcing, manufacturing, marketing and retailing of GAS clothing and accessory products in the country.

 There will also be a GAS outlet in Calcutta by the end of this year. There are plans to sell the brand through 60-70 shops in the eastern region, of which 45-50 outlets will be in the city. 

 We are targeting an end-of-the-year launch for our first GAS standalone store in Calcutta, Aniruddha Deshmukh, president retail and FMCG, Raymond Ltd, said. The prices of GAS jeans and accessories will range from Rs 1,800 to Rs 8,000. There will be many items in the Rs 2,000-4000 bracket.

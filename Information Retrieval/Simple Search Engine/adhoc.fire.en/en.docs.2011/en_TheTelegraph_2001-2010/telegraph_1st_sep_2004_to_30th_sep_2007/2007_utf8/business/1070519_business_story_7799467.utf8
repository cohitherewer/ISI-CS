 Mumbai, May 18: The Aditya Birla group will invest up to Rs 9,000 crore in its retail venture over the next three years. The group will go solo in the venture and not involve a partner. 

 Aditya Birla Retail, as the new unlisted company will be called, will initially launch around 1,000 supermarkets (less than 10,000 square feet) under the More brand and then set up hypermarkets (75,000sq ft) across the country. 

 The $24-billion group feels the skill sets required to run the venture are available within the company and, therefore. Aditya Birla Retail will hire personnel from both within and outside the group, including other countries. 

 The retail venture will be funded through a mix of debt and equity. None of the groups listed companies will have to shell out any funds for the rollout. The company may also tap the capital market in the future. 

 The group had acquired Trinetra Super Retail four months ago. Trinetra Super Retail has more than half-a-million square feet of selling area and a strong presence in the supermarket business in the four southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. 

 The first of the 1,000 More supermarkets will come up in Pune this month. 

 Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said the group intends to be among the leading retail players in India. He said Aditya Birla Retails strategy will be to provide multi-shopping formats. It would initially begin with a series of conveniently located neighbourhood supermarkets that would stock the daily and weekly household shopping needs. Later hypermarkets will be set up to cater to monthly and event-based shopping needs. 

 I believe the time has now come to offer Indian consumers a better shopping experience, he said. 

 Sumant Sinha, CEO of the retail business, said the marts will not offer the lowest price, but the best possible price. The focus will be to be offer a value package to the housewife.

 Birla did not agree with the view that the group was a late entrant to this business and had lost the first mover advantage to rivals like Reliance Retail. He added that the penetration of multi-chain stores in India has been poor.

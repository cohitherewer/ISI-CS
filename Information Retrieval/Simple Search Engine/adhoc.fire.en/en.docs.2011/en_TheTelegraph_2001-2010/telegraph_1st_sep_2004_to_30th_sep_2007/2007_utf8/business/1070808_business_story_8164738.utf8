 Boston tower firm catches R-Com signal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ambani: Ambitious

 Mumbai, Aug. 7: Reliance Communications (R-Com) is in talks with American Tower Corp, the worlds largest telecom tower company, to sell anything between 15 and 21 per cent in its recently spun-off tower business.

 Last month, seven overseas investors had picked up a 5 per cent stake in Reliance Telecom Infrastructure Ltd (RTIL) for Rs 1,400 crore, which valued the wireless tower infrastructure company at Rs 27,000 crore ($6.75 billion).

 The Anil Ambani-owned company is looking to sell the stake to American Tower Corp at a valuation that is at least 25 per cent higher than the previous transaction.

 It is now learnt that the American Tower transaction, which could be announced in a couple of months, could take the valuation of RTIL to Rs 34,000 crore.

 R-Com chairman Anil Ambani had told reporters last month that the company would pursue opportunities to further unlock value through an initial public offering of RTIL and/or strategic sale at an appropriate time.

 The strategic stake sale in RTIL could be an entry point for Boston-based American Tower which has been planning to set foot in India for quite some time now. Recently, James Taiclet, the chief executive of American Tower, had said he was engaged in talks with various Indian telecom companies.

 A spokesperson from R-Com refused to comment on the buzz that American Tower was being inducted as a strategic investor in RTIL. We have no comments, he added.

 Analysts said RTIL would be able to obtain a higher valuation on account of its large presence and potential to host multiple tenants. RTIL now has 14,000 towers and the plan is to add another 23,000 this fiscal. The companys tower network now covers 10,000 towns and 300,000 villages; the target is to expand this to 25,000 towns and 600,000 villages.

 The importance of infrastructure like towers will only grow in view of the robust subscriber additions by telecom companies. With average revenue per user (ARPU) also coming down, it is felt that companies will have to look at sharing infrastructure to bring down costs and, thereby, maintain profitability.

 Last months stake sale to seven investors and the subsequent valuation translated into around Rs 135 per R-Com share, which was nearly 25 per cent of its then market price.

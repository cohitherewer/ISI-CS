 New Delhi, Aug. 3: The government today approved 17 foreign direct investment proposals worth Rs 575.83 crore, including Television Eighteen Groups planned investment of Rs 202 crore in MTV Networks India and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries infusion of Rs 37.35 crore in a joint venture in diesel engines.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram cleared the proposals on recommendations of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board.

 Television Eighteen (TV18) will pick up an equity in MTV Networks India through its Mauritius-based wholly owned arm, BK Holdings Limited. BK Holdings will raise the funds from overseas markets.

 MTV Networks India is a part of US media giant Viacom. The company distributes the TV channels MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon in India, and the deal is part of the strategic alliance between Viacom and TV18 Group announced in May this year.

 According to the plan, MTV Networks India will uplink and broadcast Viacom-branded channels apart from a new Hindi entertainment channel and a bouquet of non-news channels.

 Among other proposals was one of Mumbai-based Human Value Developers which is bringing in Rs 235 crore. The proposal relates to investment in a company engaged in stock broking and offering various other financial products and services to retail investors.

 In chemicals and petrochemicals, the government cleared a Rs 88-crore investment proposal of CR Seals India, now known as SKF Sealing Solutions.

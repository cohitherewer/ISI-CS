 Markets breathe easy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 24: The Reserve Banks decision to keep all key rates unchanged today sparked off a strong 208-point rally on the stock market, which closed over 14000 for the first time since February 22.

 There was hectic buying after the RBI kept banks cash provisioning (CRR), short-term lending and borrowing (repo and reverse repo) rates and the bank rate unchanged in its annual policy, brokers said.

 The Bombay Stock Exchanges 30-share index opened the day at 13893.72. It surged to an intra-day high of 14197.32 when it became clear that the key rates have been spared this time. The index closed at 14136.72, a net rise of 208.39 points, or 1.5 per cent, over the previous close of 13928.33. 

 The broader S amp;P CNX nifty of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) gained 56.70 points, or 1.39 per cent, to close at 4141.80 against the previous close of 4085.10.

 Banking stocks led the bull charge on the bourses, followed by auto, metal and telecom shares. The bankex jumped 279.56 points, or 4.06 per cent, to end at 7161.40. The BSE auto index followed with a rise of 1.65 per cent over the last close. The SBI scrip rose Rs 72.90 to close at Rs 1,132.90, ICICI Bank gained Rs 33.45 to Rs 950.25, while HDFC Bank rose by Rs 26.20 to Rs 1,013.60. 

 Activity was more pronounced in rate sensitive sectors, brokers said.

 Auto stocks gained as interest rates were not raised. Since a large part of the vehicles sold are financed, the status quo on interest rates means that their sales will not be hit further, an analyst said. 

 Shares of Reliance Industries touched a new peak at Rs 1,580.45, gaining Rs 26.35 at close. 

 IT companies, which have large export revenues, remained hesitant as the RBIs policy is likely to help the rupee strengthen.

 The market had expected the central bank to tighten norms for external commercial borrowings, but the RBI took various measures that would increase inflows into the country.

 While Infosys eased by Rs 9.40 to Rs 2,058.15, TCS was lower by Rs 20.30 to Rs 1,225.80 and Wipro by Rs 12.65 to Rs 554.35. 

 The rupee climbed by 50 paise to more than nine-year high of 41.18 against the greenback due to heavy dollar selling triggered by the monetary policy.

 Ray of hope

 Home loan rates can only go down from here, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 The household budgets of three million home loan borrowers in this country have fallen apart as they struggle to pay their increased EMIs in the aftermath of an unprecedented 4.50 percentage point rise in interest rates between April 2005 and May this year. 

 The EMI of a person who has taken a loan of Rs 10 lakh for 20 years in January 2005 has gone up by nearly 35 per cent (see Table 2) more than the increase in ones annual income.

 A rate reversal is expected only by the end of this calendar year. Some signs of lending rates softening are evident, said O.P. Bhatt, CMD of the State Bank. 

 The growth in non-agricultural credit in the banking system has slowed down following hard monetary measures by the RBI over the last 24 months. Part of the slowdown could also be attributed to the fact that April to June is generally a lean period for business. 

 A slowdown in credit and a simultaneous spurt in deposits have left banks flush with funds to lend. But borrowers are not coming in this time around. So, banks are trying to lure them with lower rates. 

Even before the RBI hiked the CRR (cash reserve ratio) to 7 per cent on July 31, banks were talking about softening of lending rates from September. They all agree that interest rates have peaked. 

 When interest rates are set for a decline, banks first reduce their rates on liabilities (which is deposits in this case). Reduction in rates on assets follows after a time gap, said A.C. Mahajan, CMD of Allahabad Bank. Mahajans statement has a testimony almost all banks have reduced their deposit rates from 9.75 per cent in May-June to 9 per cent now. 

 Interest rates in the economy, including those of home loans, have peaked and it is unlikely they would go up further, said HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh. However, I dont see lending rates coming down very soon, he added. 

 The decline in lending rates, including home loans, will be delayed because of the CRR hike. This is because, banks cost of deposit, including the existing deposits, will go up. Banks will now have to keep aside Rs 7 as stipulated cash reserve with the RBI for every Rs 100 accepted as a deposit. Earlier they had to set aside Rs 6.50 for every Rs 100.

 Till July, if a bank was giving a 9 per cent interest on deposits, it was effectively on Rs 93.50 because Rs 6.50 had to be kept as cash reserve with the RBI. Therefore, the banks cost of deposit was 9.625 per cent, while it could lend only Rs 70.12 (statutory liquidity ratio is 25 per cent). The bank will have to lend Rs 70.12 at a minimum interest rate of 12.83 per cent just to cover its costs, not to mention administrative and other costs.

 Now the bank will have to give Rs 9 as interest on Rs 93 (CRR has been hiked to 7 per cent) at a cost of 9.68 per cent, while it can lend only Rs 69.75. The lending rate will have to be 12.90 per cent if the bank has to just cover its cost of deposit. 

 If banks can reduce their deposit rates to 8.5 per cent, they will be able to lend Rs 69.75 (against every Rs 100 mobilised as deposit) at an interest rate of 12.19 per cent to cover up their costs of deposit. In other words, they will be able to reduce their lending rates from 12.83 per cent to 12.19 per cent a decline of 64 basis points.

 With the inflation rate moderating, the pressure on home loan rates has also eased, Parekh said. 

 The RBI will come out with its monetary policy review in September. It may lower its key rates depending on the inflationary and liquidity situations in the economy at that time. As of now, inflation is ruling low and there is ample liquidity in the market to keep rates from going up. 

 What now?

 Borrowers may consider cutting their expenditure to pay for higher EMIs for the time being. One can prepay a part of the loan outstanding. The rise in home loan rates in quick successions has left its mark on principal outstanding. Table 2 shows that a borrower could repay only 4.6 per cent of his/her loan principal despite paying a higher EMI with every rise in the interest rate the increase in EMI went to service the higher interest liability on the loan amount. You will have to prepay Rs 35,000 (for every Rs 1 lakh loan taken) for every 0.50 percentage point rise in interest rate to keep the EMI at the original level.

 Shifting to fixed rate loans from a floating rate would, however, not be a prudent decision because very few banks provide fixed loans. They reset rates once every 2-3 years. Besides, these rates are often as high as 13-14 per cent! 

 You can, however, consider switching over from one lender to another offering a lower interest rate. 

 Interest rates will not always remain high. We have already seen one cycle in this decade declining between 2000 to 2004 and then moving up again to reach a peak now.

 Mittal: Gung-ho

 New Delhi, July 26: Bharti Airtel today said its net profit nearly doubled to Rs 1,512 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal.

 The leading cellular operator said the profit surge came on the back of price cuts and increased coverage in rural areas. The company added the highest number of mobile subscribers among all telecom firms in the period under review.

 The robust performance, however, failed to impress stock markets where the Bharti scrip closed lower at Rs 925.55 against the previous close of Rs 946.80, a loss of Rs 21.55, or 2.28 per cent.

 Bharti reported a net addition of 57 lakh customers, taking the total number of subscribers to 4.5 crore as on June 30, an increase of 82 per cent on a year-on-year basis. The company, which has earmarked $3.5 billion for capacity expansion in 2007-08, now has a market share of 23.5 per cent in the cellular segment.

 The companys revenues grew 53 per cent to Rs 5,905 crore in the first quarter from Rs 3,856 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago, the company said in a statement. 

 Bharti plans to set up 30,000 wireless towers by March 2008. At the end of the first quarter, its network coverage has increased to 62 per cent from 46 per cent a year ago.

 With price cuts, Bharti said average revenue per user declined to Rs 390 during the quarter from Rs 441 in the same quarter last year, while the average talk time of customers increased to 478 minutes from 441 minutes a year ago.

 Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal said, The company has maintained the growth momentum and further consolidated its market leadership in the wireless segment. We believe that the Indian telecom sector is entering the next phase of growth. We will continue to expand our network aggressively to enhance penetration in rural markets and be at the forefront of this growth.

 Cash profit of the company was up 97 per cent to Rs 2,622 crore for the quarter from Rs 1,333 crore a year ago. Earnings before interest, depreciation, taxation and amortisation stood at Rs 2,447 crore, up 63 per cent from last year.

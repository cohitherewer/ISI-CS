 IFGL gives priority to acquisitions

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 29: IFGL Refractories Ltd is ready with a Rs 500-crore warchest for acquisitions at home and abroad.

 Pradeep Bajoria, director and chief executive of the city-based refractory maker, said the company was looking at multiple acquisitions in the next one-and-a-half years.

 If IFGL manages to pull it off, the company will be able to reach its target of a Rs 1,000-crore turnover by 2008-09. 

 The company expects to end this year with net sales of Rs 336 crore. Bajoria, however, said the balancesheet would allow the company to go for big acquisitions in India, the UK and the US. 

 One of the large assets reportedly up for sale is ACCs refractory business, which ICICI Venture Funds bought last year for Rs 257 crore. 

 Bajoria said IFGL would look at it once the asset is put up for sale. ICICI expects to garner Rs 400 crore by selling ACCs refractory business.

 IFGL has acquired two UK companies, Monocon and Goricon Groups, in the last two fiscals. It now has manufacturing facilities in six countries, including Brazil, China and India. The company exports 60 per cent of its products from India.

 It will also gradually expand operations in China to cut costs and gain better market access in that country.

 Bajoria said the UK and US operations would serve only the local market, while China and India take care of exports.

 The company is shifting some of its business from the UK to China to avail of cost advantage. But we are still looking at acquisitions there to gain market access, Bajoria added.

 On the financial performance of the company during the first nine months, Bajoria said overseas operations contributed significantly to the overall revenue.

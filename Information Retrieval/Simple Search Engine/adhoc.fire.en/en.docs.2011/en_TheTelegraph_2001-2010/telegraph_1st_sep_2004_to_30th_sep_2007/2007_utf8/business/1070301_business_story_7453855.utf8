The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Theres nothing for the taxpayer

 GUEST COLUMN - Subhash Lakhotia

 In spite of the fact that the country is facing a big inflation problem, it was expected from the finance minister that some relief at least would be granted to the tax-paying public of India, which will help them fight inflation.

 But a step-by-step reading of the budget makes it very clear that there is no special concession or benefit granted to taxpayers. 

 The general exemption limit, which has been hiked by just Rs 10,000 for individuals and Hindu undivided families (HUFs), would in practice mean a saving of income tax of just Rs 1,000 for all individuals, women tax payers (below 65 years), and the Hindu undivided families.

 But senior citizens would gain Rs 2,000 due to the hike in the exemption limit. There is no realignment even of the tax rates. 

 Hence, a senior citizen would continue to pay a starting level tax rate of 20 per cent. The basic exemption limit is hiked to Rs 1,10,000 for individuals and HUFs, while it is Rs 1,45,000 for women taxpayers (below 65 years), and is Rs 1,95,000, for senior citizens. 

 In tune with the inflation, this penny-wise increase in the exemption limit cannot be expected to bring cheers to the tax-paying public of India.

 The exemption in respect of housing interest has also not increased in spite of the recent hike in the interest rates. Similarly, the deduction under Section 80C has not been hiked and it continues to be Rs 1,00,000 per taxpayer.

 For firms and the corporate sector, the applicability of surcharge at 10 per cent has been scrapped in case the income is up to Rs 1 crore. 

 However, for individuals and HUFs, the requirement to pay surcharge continues if the total income is in excess of Rs 10 lakh. Taxpayers were expecting the education cess to go away. But an additional surcharge has been proposed in this years budget at 1 per cent, which will be known as secondary and higher secondary education cess. This will increase the burden of taxpayers. 

 The tax provisions introduced in the Finance Bill, 2007, is going to make life difficult for all categories of taxpayers.

 The budget provides for a charge of capital gains tax on selling paintings, drawings, sculptures or any work of art, because the definition of capital asset is proposed to be amended.

 The provisions of tax deduction at source have been amended, which will provide some relief to small taxpayers because the limit for non-deduction of income tax from bank fixed deposit as also from post office investments has been increased to Rs 10,000 from the existing level of Rs 5,000. 

 However, for other payments of interest, the TDS provisions will be applicable even if the amount exceeds Rs 5,000 per annum. 

 Unfortunately, the finance minister has done nothing special for salaried employees and the common taxpayers.

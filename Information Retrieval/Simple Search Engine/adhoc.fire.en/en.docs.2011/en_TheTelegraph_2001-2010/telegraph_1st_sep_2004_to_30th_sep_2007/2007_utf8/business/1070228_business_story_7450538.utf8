 Market cap in good health

 New Delhi, Feb. 27 (PTI): Sustained investor interest will keep alive the buoyancy in the bourses. The stock market peaked to 14724 points this month, helping India catch up with the mature markets in terms of market capitalisation to GDP ratio.

 The ongoing financial and regulatory reforms for the capital market, together with accelerated economic growth and macroeconomic stability, sustained the investors confidence in the capital market, said the economic survey.

 India with a market capitalisation of 91.5 per cent of GDP compared favourably not only with the emerging markets but also with economies like Japan (96 per cent) and South Korea (94.1 per cent) and shows signs of catching up with some of the mature economies.

 The market value of the stocks was second highest among all the emerging markets, surpassing those of Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan at the end of 2006. In comparison, Chinas market cap was just 33.3 per cent of GDP at the end of 2006. Market cap in terms of GDP indicates the relative size of the capital market, besides investor confidence and discounted future earnings of the corporate sector.

 Improved investor awareness and expanding equity cult among the small savers appear to augur well for buoyant stock markets, the survey said.

 The expectations of higher corporate investment and earnings, robust GDP growth and governments commitment to carry forward economic reforms are also expected to scale up the interest of foreign institutional investors to retain India as one of the preferred destinations.

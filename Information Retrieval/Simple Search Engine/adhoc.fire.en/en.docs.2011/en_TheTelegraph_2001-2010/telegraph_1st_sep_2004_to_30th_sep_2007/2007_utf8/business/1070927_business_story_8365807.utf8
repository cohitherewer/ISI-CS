 Calcutta, Sept. 26: The fate of the Bengal governments proposal to develop 20 clusters for micro and small industries will be decided on October 1. 

 We will meet the Centres department of micro, small and medium enterprises on October 1. We had submitted a report on the 20 clusters. Following that, the government called us for a meeting. Hopefully, we will get the approvals for all the proposals, said Aariz Aftab, director of the department of micro and small enterprises in Bengal.

 The state government plans to develop a cluster in the city for manufacturing fans, Howrah for foundry, shuttle cork and metal spares manufacturing, Nadia for brass, base metal, gold and silver works, Murshidabad for plastics products and Malda for honey. Other hubs will be set up at South 24-Parganas for filigree and zari works, North 24-Parganas for silver ornaments, Bankura for roofing tiles, Burdwan for wood carving and rice mills, Hooghly for jute products and Coochbehar for sheetalpati. 

 We are working on identifying more locations for developing clusters and proposals for these will be sent to the Union government later, said Aftab.

 Manabendra Mukherjee, minister for micro and small enterprises, said the government planned to develop 40 industrial estates. Mukherjee was speaking at a seminar organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce here today . 

 He also said the government was looking for a suitable partner to set up an advanced technology centre for micro and small enterprises in the state.

 We also want to involve some of the centres of excellence such as the IITs and the universities for the venture, Mukherjee added.

 IBM chief calls on Maran

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 8: IBM chairman and CEO Samuel J. Palmisano today met communications minister Dayanidhi Maran to discuss the companys plans for India.

 During the meeting, Maran invited IBM to take part in Indias national e-governance initiative, besides discussing the companys India strategy.

 Elaborating on Palmisanos sixth visit to India, Amanda Garland, IBMs Asia Pacific director, said, India is an important country for IBM. He (Palmisano) met some of the companys existing clients.

 While Palmisano managed to avoid the waiting media contingent, company officials declined to comment on specific issues. On the reported talks to provide technology support to Bhartis proposed retail venture with Wal-Mart, Garland said, I am not aware of it.

 She also denied that the companys CEO met Reliance officials. 

 According to reports, Reliance Communications is in talks with IBM to outsource its infotech functions. In June last year, IBM had announced an investment of $6 billion in India over the next three years to set up research facilities and expand its centres here.

 It had recently signed a 10-year contract worth $600-800 million with Idea Cellular to manage its IT infrastructure and another with DLF.

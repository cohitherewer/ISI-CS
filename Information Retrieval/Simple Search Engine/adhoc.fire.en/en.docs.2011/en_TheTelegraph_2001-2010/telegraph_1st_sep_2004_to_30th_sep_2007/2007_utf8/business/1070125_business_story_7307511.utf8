The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Month-end meeting to assess FDI security threat

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Jan. 24: Cabinet secretary B.K. Chaturvedi has convened a special meeting of secretary-level officers of different ministries to discuss the potential danger of foreign direct investment to national security.

 This reflects the concern at the highest level, especially in the home and defence ministries, about security in the frantic rush for FDI and the subsequent need for safeguards. 

 The economic ministries, including finance, commerce, shipping, civil aviation, petroleum and telecom, have been asked to attend the meeting which is scheduled for the end of this month. 

 A senior government official told The Telegraph that there were some differences in the perception of the home and defence ministries on the one hand and the economic ministries on the other. The meeting will provide a forum to thrash out the issues involved, he said. 

 While the economic ministries are liberal about the inflow of foreign funds as it provides impetus to infrastructure and growth, the defence and home ministries urge caution on investments from certain countries.

 They have cited the US, which has related laws to address national security concerns. 

 Incidentally, the Union government did not allow Hong Kong-based Hutchison Port Holdings, the largest independent port operator in the world, to invest in India. 

 Hutchison Port did not receive the security clearance to build container terminals at the Mumbai and Chennai ports.

 In the US, Hutchison Port parent Hutchison Whampoa, owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, was forced to scrap plans for Global Crossing, partially because of Lis close ties with China. 

 Hutchison Whampoa, in spite of huge investments, now wants to quit Indias Hutchison Essar.

 The economic ministries are expected to highlight this in its support for a relaxed FDI regime.

 The Indian Navy, too, had objected to Chinese and West Asian companies the latter for their links with Pakistan bidding for oil blocks. 

 The Navy felt the companies could gather valuable data on Indian waters to make the country susceptible to submarine attacks. 

 The home ministry also opposed Chinese companies offering drilling services to Oil India Ltd and ONGC in the Northeast. 

 The ministry argued that Beijing still claims some areas in the Northeast; therefore, it could not allow Chinese workers in the area.

 Given the fresh trouble in Assam, the home ministry is expected to continue with the hardline approach.

 Q amp;A

 Identity crisis

 I opened a demat account when PAN was not mandatory and in the demat account my name appears as Binay Krishna Banerjee. I deposited 40 GTC shares in that account for dematerialisation. I have a PAN where my name appears as Binay Krishna Bandyopadhyay. My DP, Indiabulls, is not accepting the said PAN even against my declaration through affidavit that Binay Krishna Banerjee and Binay Krishna Bandyopadhyay are one and the same person. What should I do?

 B. Banerjee, Kasba

 You are in deep trouble. What you can do is change your surname from Bandyopadhyay to Banerjee in your PAN. That would be easier and submit the new PAN with DP to release your shares in the demat account. Get a PAN application form from UTI Securities office and do it.

 Mutual fund investment

 I invested Rs 50,000 in a diversified equity mutual fund. In which column of the income tax return form should this investment be mentioned? When I invested the money the net asset value of the scheme was Rs 44.83. At what NAV could I get Rs 1 lakh on redemption?

 Sushil amp; Tapan Biswas, Kidderpore

 Investments are not required to be shown in the income 

 tax return form unless the same is disposed of with 

 a loss or gain. Income tax return forms deal with cash/income 

 flows. If there is a loss or gain from investment, it 

 has to be shown in the income tax form in the column 

 specified for short-term or long-term nature of the 

 capital gain. When the NAV of the fund is Rs 91.68, 

 your redemption value of units will be Rs 1 lakh.

 PPF income

 Should interest income for financial year 2006-07 on PPF deposit be mentioned in the E1 schedule (details of exempt income) of ITR 2? What is the tax treatment of interest income on credit balance in the National Saving Scheme? Is the interest income tax-free? 

 Rina Thakur, Calcutta

 Yes. Interest income from PPF has to be shown in E1. The interest on NSS is taxable.

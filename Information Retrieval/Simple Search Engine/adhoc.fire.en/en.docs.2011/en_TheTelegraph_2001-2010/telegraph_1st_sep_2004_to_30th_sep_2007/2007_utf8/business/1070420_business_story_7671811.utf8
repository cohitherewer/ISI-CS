 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 19: The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) today extended the incentive scheme on rice procurement by two to six months. 

 This will enable the Food Corporation of India (FCI) to buy more paddy from the market.

 Under the scheme, FCI will pay a bonus of Rs 40 per quintal of paddy over and above the minimum support price.

 The decision was taken to ensure adequacy of foodgrain stocks in the central pool and food security, said a spokesperson after the meeting of the CCEA.

 The government had announced a bonus for paddy procurement during the kharif marketing season of 2006-07 above the minimum support price of Rs 580 per quintal for the common variety and Rs 610 per quintal for the A category.

 The bonus will be valid till May 31 in Bihar and Kerala, while farmers in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Tamil Nadu and Bengal would be able to avail of this incentive till September-end.

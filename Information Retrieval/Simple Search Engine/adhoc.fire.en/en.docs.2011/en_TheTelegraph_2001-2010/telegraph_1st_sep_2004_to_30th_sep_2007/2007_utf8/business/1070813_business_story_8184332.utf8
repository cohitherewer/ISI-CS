 Hind Copper eyes equity issue

 A STAFF REPORTER

 On treasure hunt

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: State-owned Hindustan Copper Ltd may tap the market to fund its expansion.

 The company, in which the government holds a 99.5 per cent stake, plans to invest around Rs 2,000 crore over the next four years to explore and develop new mines and open closed ones. It also plans to enter gold mining.

 Hindustan Copper is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Its shares, however, are seldom traded because of very low free-float.

 The company wants to be financially strong to fetch a good price for its shares. Its equity has been reduced to Rs 384.11 crore from Rs 984.95 crore, which has offset its accumulated losses.

 Good tidings in the global copper market have helped the firm make a Rs 450-crore profit in the previous three fiscals.

 Hindustan Copper wants to bag a few projects before it raised capital.

 We are eyeing two projects at Surda in Jharkhand and Banwas in Rajasthan, chairman and managing director Satish C. Gupta said.

 Surda, in East Singbhum district of Jharkhand, is being reopened and production is expected to start by the last quarter of this financial year. 

 The Banwas copper mine in Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan has ore reserves of over 22.5 million tonnes. The mine is expected to be ready in about 18 months.

 The company also has two big projects lined up development of copper deposits at Chapri Sideshwar in Jharkhand and Malanjkhand in Madhya Pradesh.

 The first project will require an investment of Rs 600 crore. However, the company plans to form a joint venture to work on this project. In case of a joint venture, the partner will make the substantial investment.

 The Malanjkhand project will involve an investment of Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 1,200 crore. It will be completed in four years.

 Gupta said despite good internal accruals, more funds could be required for expansion.

 Hindustan Copper is implementing enterprise resource planning to benefit from its current and future expansions.

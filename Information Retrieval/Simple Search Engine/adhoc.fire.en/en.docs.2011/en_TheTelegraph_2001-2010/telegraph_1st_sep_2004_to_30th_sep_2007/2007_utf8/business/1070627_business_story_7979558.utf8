 Accor readies rich spread

 New Delhi, June 26 (PTI): Hospitality services provider Accor is planning to strengthen its operations in India by increasing the number of clients across various segments. It will lay special emphasis on small and medium-sized companies.

 India offers a large potential for new clients, especially small companies, which are now willing to serve their employees and distribution partners better, Accor Services chief operating officer Serge Ragozin said. The Europe-based Accor groups product portfolio in India includes human resources vouchers and smart cards such as restaurant tickets, meal vouchers and gift vouchers. 

 It also offers solutions to companies to build and manage incentives, loyalty and reward programmes for their employees under the brand name Accentiv.

 The Indian operations are managed by Accor Radhakrishna Corporate Services, which now plans to expand its product offering across all industry verticals, including pharmaceuticals and manufacturing. It will also introduce voucher services for social programmes. Accor Services India has 2,000 clients in 175 cities. The company today announced the acquisition of Singapore-based Sufrgold, which has operations in India.

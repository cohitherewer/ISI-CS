 Job cut hint at Alcatel-Lucent

 Paris, Feb. 6 (Reuters): Telecommunications equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent could cut more than 20 per cent of its world-wide staff, French weekly LExpansion reported on Tuesday, citing industry sources. This would mean 15,000 to 20,000 jobs, of which 1,500 to 2,000 would be in France. The site quoted union sources as saying 500 of these would be through early retirement.Alcatel had no immediate comment. Alcatel-Lucent had earlier planned to cut 10 per cent of its workforce as part of last years merger between French and American groups to create the worlds second largest supplier of telecom network, according to LExpansion. 

 French unions were meeting on Tuesday afternoon to consider whether to strike over previous speculation of heavy job cuts, but one union official cast doubt on the LExpansion report. 

 The figure is enormous and so is the range (between the estimates). If that were the case it would be an admission that the merger is a failure, said Jean-Baptiste Triquet, a representative at Alcatel of the CFDT union. Those sorts of job cuts would cause a scandal. 

 On January 23, Alcatel-Lucent lost over a tenth of its market value after it warned that uncertainty created by its recent merger would hurt sales and profits. The two companies began operating from December 1 as a combined unit which is the worlds second-largest supplier of telecom network and mobile equipment after Cisco Systems Inc.

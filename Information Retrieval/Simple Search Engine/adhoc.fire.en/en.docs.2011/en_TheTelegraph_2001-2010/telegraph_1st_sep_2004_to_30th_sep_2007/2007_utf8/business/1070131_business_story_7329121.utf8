 Strict vigil on four telecom circles

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Close watch

 New Delhi, Jan. 30: The telecom regulator today asked all private cellular operators in Bengal, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh to submit a compliance report on whether they have implemented the governments order allowing telephone calls within these four circles to be treated as intra-circle for tariff purposes.

 The order implies that calls made from a Hutch or Airtel number to a BSNL mobile should have the same rate as calls made from a Hutch mobile to an Airtel number within these four states.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) said though the directive had been issued with immediate effect from February 2006, the service providers now need to submit a report indicating the date from when they started complying with the direction.

 The new directive comes in the wake of the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) rejecting last month a plea by some private cellular firms to be allowed to continue charging higher rates for BSNL numbers.

 The operators had challenged the regulators direction to discontinue differential tariffs within Maharashtra, Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh the four circles where the department of telecommunication, in May 2005, permitted inter-service area connectivity among service providers.

 The operators had contended that since there was no direct connectivity between the networks of GSM players and state-owned mobile operators BSNL and MTNL calls had to be routed like STD calls. This necessitated higher tariffs, the operators argued.

 The TDSAT had held that there was no merit in charging higher tariffs and upheld Trais directive to the private mobile operators to end discriminatory tariffs.

 The arrangement for call routing and dialling in these states was different from other states. Calls within the four states were treated as intra-service calls, leading to a decline in tariffs charged by mobile operators.

 However, some private mobile firms specified higher tariff for calls terminating in the mobile networks of BSNL and MTNL within these states.

 The regulator examined this differential tariff issue and found it was discriminatory and was preventing consumers from getting full advantage of the government decision to allow inter-service area connectivity within the four states.

 In February last year, Trai had asked private mobile operators in the four states not to charge higher tariffs for calls made to BSNL or MTNL subscribers. 

 In the light of Trais direction and the order of TDSAT, the regulator said it has asked all mobile companies in these states to report compliance to its direction by January 23 and intimate the date from which the service providers have been complying with the direction.

 Levy cut 

 Telecom tariffs may have touched the low in India, but it can further go down from April with Trai gearing up to start the process of next round of reduction of a key telecom levy access deficit charge with the issue of a consultation paper.

 Senior Trai officials said the process would start next month where it would call for traffic data from operators for the purpose of calculating the reduction of ADC from what is currently being paid by them on NLD and ILD calls. There is no ADC on local calls and in urban areas.

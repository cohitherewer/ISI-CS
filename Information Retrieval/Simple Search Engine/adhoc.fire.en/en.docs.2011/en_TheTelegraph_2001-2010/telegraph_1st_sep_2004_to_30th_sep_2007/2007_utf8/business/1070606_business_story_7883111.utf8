 Sterlite kicks off ADS issue

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Agarwal: Big step

 Mumbai, June 5: Sterlite Industries (India) has started distribution of the preliminary prospectus of its American depositary share (ADS) issue. The company plans to raise around $2 billion to fund expansion plans, including buyouts.

 The non-ferrous metals and mining company will offer 125 million shares with an over-allotment option of 18.75 million shares. After the offer, the shares will represent about 18.3 per cent of Sterlite. The company has applied to get the ADS listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SLT, Sterlite Industries said in a letter to the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 The underwriters and joint global coordinators and bookrunners to the offer are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner amp; Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley amp; Co International Limited and Citigroup Global Markets Inc.

 Nomura Singapore is the underwriter for the public offering without listing in Japan. Sterlite expects to allocate 11.5 million equity shares in the form of ADS in that country. After this offering, Vedanta Resources Plc is likely to own approximately 62.8 per cent of the outstanding shares.

 In a filing to the Securities and Exchanges Commission of the US, the company said the ADS price would not be more than 5 per cent or less than 10 per cent of its India price.

 Sterlite will use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including meeting investment and working capital needs, reduction of debt, possible acquisitions of complementary businesses and consolidation of its subsidiaries.

 The company intends to exercise the call option to acquire the government of Indias remaining 29.5 per cent holding in Hindustan Zinc (HZL). This will be 26 per cent if the government exercises its right to sell 3.5 per cent of HZLs shares to its employees. 

 Sterlite added that while it was reported that the government was taking steps to sell its remaining ownership interest in HZL through a public offer prior to its exercise of the call option, it may have to look into alternative means of increasing ownership interest in the company.

 SEZs are here to stay, says Singh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Singh: Firm decision

 New Delhi, March 23: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said the governments decision to set up special economic zones (SEZs) had run into rough weather, but the policy for these zones was here to stay and would not be reversed.

 These decisions are in many ways irreversible. If there were gaps in the design of the policy or in its implementation, we should halt a little, Singh said.

 He said the cost of delay was much less than the cost of wrong policies being bulldozed regardless of human, social and economic concerns.

 I do believe that we should address these concerns if we want the policy to succeed in the long run, he said.

 SEZ as an instrument of economic policy has come to stay. But in the process of implementation, we have been exposed to certain problems, which cannot be dismissed. It is the strength of our democracy, he said.

 The Prime Minister said if the government found any fault with the SEZ policy, it would make necessary changes.

 If we find there are some flaws in our policy, we can set in motion a mechanism to redress those gaps, he said.

 Singh added a more humane, more effective and a more just policy with regard to the resettlement of land oustees was being formulated. Pending the finalisation of such a scheme, there was some delay in going ahead with the announced policy on SEZ.

 To address some of the concerns, the government had put the onus of rehabilitating the displaced people on SEZ developers early this week.

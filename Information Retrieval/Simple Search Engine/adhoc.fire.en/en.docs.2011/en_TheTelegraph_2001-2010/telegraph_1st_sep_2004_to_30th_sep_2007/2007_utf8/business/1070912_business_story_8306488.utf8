 Calcutta, Sept. 11: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) has decided to reopen the Kulti Works, the oldest steel unit in the country.

 SAIL had downed shutters at Kulti on April 1, 2003, after all the employees of the plant availed themselves of the voluntary retirement scheme.

 A decision was taken to sell the unit, with the PSU seeking expressions of interest from private companies.

 Many private entities, such as Tata Steel subsidiary Tata Metaliks and the Pawan Ruia group, showed interest in the plant.

 SAIL then changed tack after it committed itself to a massive expansion plan in Bengal.

 Following a meeting with Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today afternoon at Writers Buildings, SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta said the company has decided in principle to revive the plant.

 We will see how the idle assets can be utilised. It will not require much of an investment though, he added.

 SAIL is likely to revive the foundry at Kulti that makes cast iron products and spun pipes.

 Roongta, however, made no commitments as to when the PSU will reopen the unit. 

 In its plans for the state, SAIL will invest Rs 17,000 crore over the next four years in IISCO Steel Plant; Rs 6,500 crore in Durgapur Steel Plant; and Rs 500 crore in Alloy Steel Plant.

 The Kulti facility is over 850 acres and has a sprawling colony of 2,300 residential units, nine-hole golf course and club. 

 The factory is over 228 acres.

 Kulti Works, set up in 1870 as Bengal Iron Works Company, became part of Indian Iron amp; Steel Company (IISCO) in 1936.

 When IISCO now called IISCO Steel Plant became sick and got referred to the Board for Industrial and Finance Reconstruction, it closed the Kulti plant.

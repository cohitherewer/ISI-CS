 Merger boosts Mittal Steel profit

 Mittal: In fine nick

 London, May 16 (PTI): Mittal Steel, led by NRI business tycoon Lakshmi Mittal, today reported a 43.7 per cent increase in its first quarter net profit, while beating its own forecast because of accelerated synergy generation from its $38billion takeover of Arcelor last year.

 The worlds largest steel maker, to be renamed Arcelor Mittal after the completion of the merger process later this year, said its net income rose to $2.3 billion for the quarter ended March 31 from $1.6 billion in the year-ago period.

 Mittal Steel said in a separate statement the two companies were actively working to complete the merger as promptly as possible in the course of 2007.

 It said the integration process was going according to the plans and synergies worth $573 million were captured in the first quarter.

 Mittal, who is president and CEO of Arcelor Mittal, said in a statement, These results reflect the strength of Arcelor Mittals global business model and the continuing strong demand for steel generally.

 The benefits of combining Arcelor and Mittal Steel continue to outperform our expectations and we are on track to deliver synergies as planned, he added.

 The companys sales and operating income rose to $24.5 billion and $3.5 billion respectively, from $20.9 billion and $2.5 billion in the year-ago period. The results included the collective quarterly figures for both Mittal Steel and Arcelor.

 Under the proposed scheme of arrangement, Mittal Steel will be first merged with its Luxembourg-based wholly owned subsidiary Arcelor Mittal, which would be subsequently merged into Arcelor.

 The combined firm would be renamed Arcelor Mittal upon completion of the merger. Arcelor Mittal and Arcelor will sign a merger agreement shortly, the company said. Shares of Arcelor Mittal have jumped nearly 40 per cent since the beginning of this year.

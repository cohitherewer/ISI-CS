 Cairn finds more oil, gas in Rajasthan 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 10: Cairn India today announced two new oil and gas discoveries in the Rajasthan block and said it had received a six-month extension from the government for further exploration in the northern region of the block.

 The discoveries were made in Kameshwari West-2 and Kameshwari West-3 wells, the company said.

 Cairn said the government has awarded the company a six-month extension to the exploration phase of the northern appraisal area of the Rajasthan block.

 The decision will help Cairn India explore the full potential of the area covering 879 square kilometres. 

 According to Cairn, these discoveries have opened up a new play in the lower Dharvi Dungar sands on the western margin of the Rajasthan basin. 

 In June 2005, Cairn was granted an 18-month extension till November 14, 2006, to complete its activities in these areas. However, work had to be stopped in the region because of the flood last year. 

 The company had then asked for an extension from the government since oil firms are given a fixed time span to complete their exploration. 

 Rahul Dhir, chief executive officer of Cairn India, said, The company is delighted to secure this extension to evaluate the potential of this area. 

 The two discoveries confirm our belief that the Rajasthan basin is world class and will continue to add incremental value.

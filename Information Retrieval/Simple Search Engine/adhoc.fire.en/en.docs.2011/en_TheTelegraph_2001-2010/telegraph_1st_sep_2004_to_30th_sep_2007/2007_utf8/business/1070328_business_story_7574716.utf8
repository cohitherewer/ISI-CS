 Pawar poll pill in sugar sweetener

 Pawar: Helping hand

 New Delhi, March 27: Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar today announced a Rs 850-crore relief package for sugar mills, including an export subsidy. 

 Pawars announcement can invite the ire of the Election Commission (EC) as the package is going to benefit millions of sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh, which is going to the polls next month. 

 The decision to offer the relief package was taken at a meeting of the Union cabinet committee on economic affairs held last Saturday but was kept under wraps as the EC code of conduct for the UP polls came into force on February 21. It is believed that the government only yesterday approached the EC for approval. It is, however, not clear whether the same was cleared by the commission. 

 According to agency reports, commission sources said a decision on the issue could be taken only after Thursday (March 29) as top officials were away from the capital in connection with polls in Uttar Pradesh.

 Pawar told reporters in Pune that the Centre had approved the export of sugar and will share expenditure to the tune of Rs 850 crore towards transport cost of shipments.

 Predicting that sugar production this year would be about 250 lakh tonnes, Pawar said going by the domestic demand of 190 lakh tonnes, India would have surplus stock of the commodity.

 A series of steps that included creating a buffer stock of 20 lakh tonnes were decided by the CCEA with an obvious objective of helping both the millers and cane producers.

 The Centre would bear an expenditure of Rs 1,300 per tonne for sugar to be exported by coastal states and Rs 1,400 for states away from the coast, Pawar added. 

 Wheat export

 Pawar said the government will not be exporting wheat. The wheat crop this year is expected to be good with the yield expected around 72 million tonnes, he said.

 Depending on the need, the central government could import good quality wheat to the tune of 30 lakh tonnes, he added.

 Govt to clear Posco hurdles

 Long wait

 New Delhi, Sept. 23 (PTI): The government has assured South Korea that clearances for the proposed Posco project in Orissa will be expedited. This comes amid fears that the steel company may terminate its plans to start its Rs 52,000-crore project here because of delays.

 The assurance was given by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee during his recent visit to Seoul. Mukherjee held talks with his counterpart Song Min-Soon, sources said.

 The project, involving one of the largest foreign investments in the country, has failed to take off because of delay in clearances from various departments.

 All stops have been pulled out and the plant has also received environmental clearance. However, the company is facing problems in securing captive iron ore mines for its proposed 12-million-tonne plant at Paradip.

 The Prime Ministers Office, which has been monitoring the progress of the project, has asked the state government to resolve the issues quickly.

 Captive port

 Worried over the tardy progress of its project in Orissa, Posco will start building a captive port a year before the actual work on the steel plant begins. The company is optimistic about tiding over the opposition from villagers to the project.

 Posco Indias chairman and managing director Soung-Sik Cho said the company would start work on its captive port early next year, while construction of the proposed steel plant was expected in 2009.

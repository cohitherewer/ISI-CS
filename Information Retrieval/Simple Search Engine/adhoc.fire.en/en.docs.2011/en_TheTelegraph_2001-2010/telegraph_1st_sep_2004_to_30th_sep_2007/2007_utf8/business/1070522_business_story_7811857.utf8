 New Delhi, May 21: The Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) today posted a 55 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 6,202 crore for the year ended March 31, 2007 compared with Rs 4,013 crore a year ago.

 The PSU, which enjoys a market share of 30 per cent, plans to expand production by 70-75 per cent in the next three years through better utilisation of capacity.

 For the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2007, the net profit jumped 72 per cent to Rs 1,902 crore compared with Rs 1,103 crore a year ago.

 SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta said prices were already high and in sync with demand. This rules out the possibility of a further hike in prices.

 He said the existing capacities would be utilised more efficiently to raise production by 1.5 million tonnes in this fiscal.

 The board today recommended a final dividend of 15 per cent. The company had earlier paid an interim dividend of 16 per cent, taking the total dividend to 31 per cent. The final dividend is subject to the approval of shareholders at the annual general meeting of the company.

 In the fourth quarter, the turnover of the company rose by 14 per cent to Rs 11,534 crore compared with Rs 10,102 crore a year ago. This was because of a higher demand for steel, greater production of value-added items and a better product mix.

 The turnover for 2006-07 increased to Rs 39,189 crore from Rs 32,280 crore in 2005-06, the company said.

 Roongta said, The results are a reflection of the inner strength of SAIL and its workforce.

 SAIL has benefited from the closure of plants in China which restricted the global supply of steel and pushed up prices.

 Analysts said the Chinese demand for steel would outstrip its supply for the first time in six years, which augured well for SAIL.

 The output in the fourth quarter was 3.25mt and for the full year it rose 5 per cent to 12mt.

 The production of saleable steel in the last fiscal was higher by 5.2 lakh tonnes. This was made possible by higher operational efficiency. SAIL also produced at 114 per cent of its capacity compared with 109 per cent in the previous fiscal.

 New Delhi, July 17: Ford India is open to launching a compact car for the local market but is not planning a product in the Rs 100,000 range as proposed by competitors. 

 At the moment we are not looking at that price point, we are just looking at a small car. Ford does not have any product in that price range, Arvind Mathew, Ford India managing director and president, told reporters here.

 He, however, said the company might consider a low-cost one such as the $3,000 car announced by Renault-Nissan if customers demanded it. 

 Tata Motors is planning to roll out a compact car priced at Rs 100,000 by the middle of next year.

 We are always focused on what our consumers want... If they want, I am willing to make it ($3,000 car), he added.

 At the moment, I am very curious to see how this car looks like, Mathew added.

 Ford sells only mid-size sedans such as the Fiesta, the hatchback Fusion and the SUV Endeavour in the Indian market. 

 The company today launched a diesel variant of the Fusion priced at Rs 6.59 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). The variant would be powered by a 1.4-litre Duratorq engine.

 Mathew said the new product would enhance Fords diesel portfolio in the Indian market, which has only the Fiesta sedan. 

 The Fiesta diesel contributes nearly 70 per cent to the overall sales of the model. 

 Ford India has achieved localisation levels of 60 per cent on the Fusion, while the Fiesta is made from 80-85 per cent locally sourced components.

 The 1.4-litre powered Fusion diesel is the first product from Ford Indias stable which qualifies for a 6 per cent rebate in excise duty on small cars.

 Last year, the government had reduced excise duty on small cars to 16 per cent from 22 per cent in order to promote India as a hub for small cars. 

 All petrol cars of up to 1.1 litre engine capacity and diesel cars up to 1.5 litre engine capacity are eligible for the excise duty benefit.

 On possible synergies between Ford India and Volvo, Mathew said the two companies would exist as independent entities in India and there was no scope for joint marketing.

 Ford Motor owns the Volvo passenger car business.

 New Delhi, June 26: Global auto majors have lined up SUV launches in India over the next few months.

 On the cards are Mitsubishis Outlander, GMs Captiva, M amp;Ms Ingenio, BMWs X5, Volvos XC90 and Suzukis Grand Vitara. 

 Sports utility vehicles (SUVs) comprise only a small part of the multi-utility vehicle market, selling 1 lakh vehicles a year. But the vehicles boast of a faster sales growth than others.

 According to industry figures, 2,947 SUVs have been sold in the premium category till May this year compared with about 2,302 in the year-ago period, registering a growth of 28 per cent.

 We are predicting total sales of about 6,500 units for 2007, a growth of over 20 per cent over the last year, said Anisha Motwani, director marketing, General Motors. In the premium segment, 5,396 units were sold last year.

 GMs Chevrolet Captiva a diesel SUV in the range of Rs 15-18 lakh will be launched early next year to compete with the Honda CR-V. Japanese major Mitsubishi Motors will also launch the Outlander in early 2008.

 Suzuki will re-enter the premium SUV market with a new version of the Grand Vitara, to be priced between Rs 18 lakh and Rs 20 lakh, in August. 

 In June, Mahindra amp; Mahindra launched the Mahindra Getaway American, while Ford India rolled out its new-generation Endeavour. 

 Ford India president and managing director Arvind Mathew expects the premium SUV segment to grow by 24 per cent in 2007.

 Y.V.S. Vijay Kumar, vice-president and business head, Hindustan Motors, said, Improvements in infrastructure, rising disposable income, perception of safety when driving big cars and changing lifestyles of customers are fuelling the growth in this segment.

 Jnaneswar Sen, senior general manager of Honda Siel Cars India, said, India is an interesting market for SUVs. Increasing disposable income and higher aspirations are motivating people to upgrade faster. After we launched the revamped CR-V in November last year, our sales really took off.

 The Honda CR-V is leading the race in sales. Of the 2,947 SUVs sold this year, 1,246 are Honda CR-Vs. Sales of CR-Vs till May this year have grown by over 52 per cent over the same period last year. In 2006, 1,585 units of the Honda CR-V were sold.

 The growth in SUV sales is reflected in those of our Pajero. Last year, more than 1,000 Pajeros were sold, Kumar added.

 The availability of global models will have a positive impact on the market. Hondas CR-V, Mitubishis Montero, Fords Endeavour and the downward price correction of the Pajero helped the market grow, said Sen.

 Auto majors are also coinciding world premiers with simultaneous launches in India.

 For instance, Porsches Cayenne Turbo was launched here immediately after its worldwide debut. Even the new Montero was unveiled here on Monday within a month of its launch abroad.

 With high-end models like the Mercedes M class, the VW Touareg, the Toyota Landcruiser Prado and the Lexus SUV being sold in the country, it is clear that the SUV segment is on a roll.

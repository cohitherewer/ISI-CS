 New Delhi, March 19: Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India (HMSI) will invest Rs 300 crore in two years to increase the capacity at its plant in Manesar to 1.2 million units.

 This will take HMSIs total investment in Manesar to Rs 1,100 crore. The unit has the capacity to manufacture nine lakh units six lakh scooters and three lakh motorcycles. 

 Honda is considering making a foray into the entry-level 100-cc segment, while it is going ahead with its plan to introduce motorcycles with higher engine capacities.

 To be present in the mass market, we have decided to enter the 100-cc segment. We are also studying the possibility of introducing higher engine capacities in India. We may bring in a completely built unit of a 500-cc motorcycle, said Yukihiro Aoshima, president and CEO of HMSI.

 When asked whether its entry into the 100-cc segment will lead to conflict of interest with Hero Honda, the leader in this category, he said, The market is big and there is enough room for both companies to co-exist. 

 The company expects to sell 7.2 lakh units this fiscal and is targeting to sell nine lakh units in the domestic market in 2007-08. We expect to clock a higher growth rate than the industry and touch the one-million-unit sales mark in three years, he said.

 The company plans to introduce an automatic scooter and introduce a variant of the Shine, its 125-cc motorcycle, in 2007-08. 

 According to Aoshima, the company is also conducting a feasibility study to set up another manufacturing facility. We have not fixed any timeframe, but are considering Haryana or the southern region to set up the plant, he said.

 The company plans to manufacture the 100-cc motorcycle in the new plant, which will have the capacity to manufacture either six lakh units or 1.2 million units, said Aoshima. 

 HMSI today launched the Unicorn, a 150-cc motorcycle with an all-new sporty look, priced at Rs 58,575 (ex-showroom, Calcutta). With this launch, the company will phase out the existing Unicorn, which was launched in 2004.

 HMSI also launched a limited edition of the Unicorn, priced at Rs 59,425. The company has produced a total of 2,500 units.

 According to estimates, the market size for 150-cc motorcycles stand at 6.4 lakh units and is expected to cross 8 lakh units in 2008.

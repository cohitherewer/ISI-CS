 Barclays launches bid for ABN AMRO

 New Account

 Amsterdam, Aug. 6 (Reuters): Barclays formally launched its 65-billion-euro ($89 billion) bid for ABN AMRO today in an attempt to beat a Royal Bank of Scotland-led consortium in the biggest-ever bank takeover.

 Barclays confirmed in a statement its offer, which entitles ABN shareholders to receive 13.15 euros in cash and 2.13 new Barclays shares for each ABN share tendered.

 The offer period will run from August 7 until October 4, Barclays said in an offer memorandum published in Dutch newspapers on Monday.

 At current share prices and foreign exchange rates, the Barclays offer is worth about 34.54 euros per share of ABN.

 Barclayss offer will compete against a planned 71-billion-euro offer by a consortium of Royal Bank of Scotland, Belgian-Dutch Fortis and Spains Santander, which will be about 93 per cent in cash.

 Barclayss formal bid comes a few hours before Fortis shareholders vote on whether Fortis can go forward to buy ABN and issue 13 billion euros in shares to fund its part of the deal.

 On July 23, Barclays raised its bid for ABN AMRO, helped by some of the biggest-ever overseas investments by China and Singapore. The ABN management came under pressure to switch support after it raised its bid. Barclays chief John Valery said the offer was conditional on getting a recommendation.

 Fortis bid

 Belgian-Dutch financial services group Fortis sought shareholders approval on Monday for its part of a three-bank bid to buy ABN AMRO. 

 Analysts have said they expect Fortis to win approval even though its shares have fallen 19 per cent since it announced that it would contribute 24 billion euros to buy ABNs Dutch operations, which it would finance with a 13-billion-euro rights issue. 

 Fortis wants shareholders at meetings in Belgium and the Netherlands on Monday to back its vision of becoming the biggest bank in the Benelux and support the rights issue. 

 Joining forces with ABN has lots of advantages, but of course it has its price. The 24 billion euros that Fortis is putting on the table is of course a very high amount of money. Quality has its price, chairman Maurice Lippens said at the start of the meeting.

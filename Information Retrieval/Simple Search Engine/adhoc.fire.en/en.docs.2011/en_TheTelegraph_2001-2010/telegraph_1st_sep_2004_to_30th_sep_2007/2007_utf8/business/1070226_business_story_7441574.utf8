 EU forces rethink on wine levy

 Drink makers in EU aim 

 a stronger foothold in India

 Domestic wine makers feel 

 a cut in the customs duty will result in increased competition from imported wines

 Duty cut is likely to make 

 imported wines cheaper by 

 Rs 150 to Rs 200 per bottle

 European Commission perceives India rsquo;s levy as a prohibitive tariff barrier against the 

 import of wines and spirits

New Delhi, Feb. 25: Faced with the EU offensive at the WTO and diplomatic pressures from Australia and Chile, the government is toying with the idea of lowering the customs duty on wine to the WTO peak rate of 150 per cent.

 Drinks makers in the 25-nation European Union are aiming at a stronger foothold in India, where spirits consumption has grown about 4 per cent a year since 2000. 

 The smaller Indian wine market has expanded at an even faster rate of 9 per cent a year. India bought more than 4 million euros worth European wine in 2004, according to an EU report.

 However, Indian wine makers are a worried lot as a reduction in the customs duty to the WTO peak rate of 150 per cent will result in increased competition from exotic wines.

 If the proposal is implemented, imported wines will become cheaper by Rs 150 to Rs 200 per bottle on an average, an industry source said.

 Indian beer makers are also unhappy. The All India Brewers Association (AIBA) wants the 16 per cent excise duty on barley malt to be removed. The industry body feels the excise duty of 16 per cent levied on malts is unjustified as malted barley is an entirely agro-based product and the actual process of converting barley to malt involves minimum mechanisation.

 Malted barley forms the single largest raw material used by the beer industry, which itself contributes significantly to an agricultural economy, said Sundeep Kumar, director, AIBA.

 The EU claims that India buys less than 1 per cent of its spirits from foreign suppliers, and imports about 15 per cent of the wine consumed in the country. The extra duties that India imposes bring total customs levies to between 177 per cent and 540 per cent on spirits.

 The European Commission has decided to haul India to the WTO over what it perceives as a prohibitive tariff barrier erected against the import of wines and spirits.

 In November last year, the EU had placed a request for consultations at the WTO, which forms the first step in the dispute process. The two sides must negotiate for at least two months before the European commission, the EUs executive arm can ask the Geneva-based global arbiter to step in and begin work on a ruling. A legal decision may then take at least 18 months. 

 However, the Indian stand is that it imposes the extra taxes because some EU governments forbid the import of Indian whisky. The two sides can only settle the dispute based on reciprocity, commerce minister Kamal Nath has said.

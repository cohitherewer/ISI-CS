 Goods and services tax on course

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 16: Union finance minister P. Chidambaram and the empowered committee of state finance ministers on value- added tax are working on a roadmap for the goods and services tax (GST), scheduled to be implemented by 2010.

 We believe that GST should not be too high but must meet state expenses, said Parthasarathi Shome, adviser to the finance minister.

 Shome was speaking at a conference organised by industry chamber Assocham, which released a study on GST: Imperative for Economic Growth.

 GST is expected to widen the tax base and improve tax compliance. This will then lead to a higher tax GDP ratio. 

 In his address, Shome said the government would face many challenges before implementing GST. The VAT panel, which is, at present, working on phasing out central sales tax, will also consider alternative GST models. 

 According to Shome, the main challenge is to make constitutional amendments and develop a model that will accrue adequate revenue to the Centre and states to meet their growing expenditure requirements.

 This will help realise the objective of introducing a common market across the country. Even the Prime Minister has indicated that we would be working towards GST, he said. 

 Initially, there was no specific provision for levying service tax but the Centre has been empowered to do so. The finance ministry and the VAT panel will deliberate on whether GST could be introduced within these legal constraints, said Shome.

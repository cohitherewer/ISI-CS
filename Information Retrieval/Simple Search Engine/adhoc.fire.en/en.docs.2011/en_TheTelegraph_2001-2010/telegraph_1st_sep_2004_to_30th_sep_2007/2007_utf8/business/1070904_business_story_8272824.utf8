 Apeejay Tea gets ready for delisting

 A STAFF REPORTER

 BITTER BREW

 Calcutta, Sept. 3: The promoters of Apeejay Surrendra Group plan to delist Apeejay Tea. A board meeting tomorrow will discuss the delisting of shares from the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).

 The promoter stake is 74.27 per cent, including UK-based Assam Frontier Tea Holdings 74 per cent. The rest is with three members of the Paul family Karan, Shirin and Priya. Apeejay Tea is the only listed company of the group. 

 The public shareholding comprises 25.73 per cent, of which institutions have a 0.47 per cent stake.

 Apeejay House and persons acting in concert with the promoters propose to acquire the shares of the public, the group informed the BSE.

 Apeejay Tea has 17 estates spread over 50,000 acres in Assam and employs about 40,000 people. It produces around 25 million kg of tea annually.

 An analyst said, Apeejay Tea is the only listed company in the group. The delisting could be a possible endeavour to make the group more closely held.

 In October 2005, the company acquired Typhoo, UKs third largest tea brand, and other associated entities from Premier Foods Plc for 80 million.

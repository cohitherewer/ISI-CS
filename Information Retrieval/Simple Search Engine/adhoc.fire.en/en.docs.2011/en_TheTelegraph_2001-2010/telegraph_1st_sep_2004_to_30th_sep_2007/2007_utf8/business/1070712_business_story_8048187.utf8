 Calcutta, July 11: The Oberoi group will invest about Rs 900 crore by 2011 to develop three properties in India, besides entering into management contracts abroad.

 We will sign management contracts for properties abroad. In India, we will develop some properties on our own, while for others we will form joint ventures, chairman P.R.S. Oberoi said.

 The group is developing one property each in Mumbai, Goa and Rajgarh in Madhya Pradesh on its own. It also has partnership projects in Bangalore and Hyderabad.

 The group has earmarked an investment of Rs 900 crore to add 1,500 rooms in India. Already, Rs 400 crore has been invested, vice-chairman S.S. Mukherjee said.

 The group has 2,950 rooms in India. The companys expansion programme will be completed between August next year and 2011, he added. The company will enter into management contracts for properties in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Cambodia and Maldives, which will together add about 1,200 rooms. 

 The Oberoi group, which operates 32 hotels in five countries, has 1,690 rooms overseas. The groups property in Udaipur the Oberoi Uday Villas has been named the best hotel in the world with an overall score of 94.36 by a readers survey by Travel and Leisure.

 In the same survey, Oberoi Amar Villas in Agra has been ranked the tenth-best hotel in the world, while Oberoi Raj Villas in Jaipur has been rated the eleventh best. 

 The group will have a minority stake in the Oberoi brand hotels to be set up in Maldives, the service apartments at Hitech City, Hyderabad and Siem Reap (Angkor Vat), Cambodia. 

 Mukherjee had earlier said EIH Ltd, which owns the Oberoi brand, had proposed to go slow on the Rs 400-crore fund-raising plan. The expansion project would be completed between August 2008 and 2011.

 The 250-room, $100-million Oberoi brand luxury hotel and 40 service apartments in Dubai are being set up in partnership with Rani International of the Aujan Group near the Business Bay in Burj Dubai. They are expected to start operations by early 2009.

 A 150-room Oberoi brand hotel is coming up next to the Trident Hilton Gurgaon.

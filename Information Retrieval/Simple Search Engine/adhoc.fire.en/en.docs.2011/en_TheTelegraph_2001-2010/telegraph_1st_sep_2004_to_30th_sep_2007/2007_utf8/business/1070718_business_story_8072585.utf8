 Mumbai, July 17: Reliance Communications Ltd (R-Com), the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani group flagship, will invest around Rs 16,000 crore this fiscal to expand its network even as it is mulling various initiatives to unlock value for its shareholders.

 As part of its value-unlocking plans, R-Com is looking to sell shares in its wireless tower infrastructure company, Reliance Telecom Infrastructure (RTIL), and FLAG Telecom. It also plans to spin off its business process outsourcing activity into an independent and profitable business and develop the 132-acre campus at Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City as a special economic zone (SEZ) focussed on IT and IT-enabled services. 

 R-Com chairman Anil Ambani told shareholders that the plans were to first make a private placement of RTIL equity with a select group of international institutional investors and then follow it up with a public listing of its shares.

 Ambani said shareholders could look forward to a positive surprise in the tower companys valuation compared with analyst estimates. 

 In the case of FLAG Telecom, which operates the companys undersea cable network, a similar exercise of private placement of equity and/or an international listing of shares is being examined.

 Ambani said R-Com was now in the final stages of preparing its next generation DTH network and services would be launched before the end of the year. R-Com also plans to launch premium IPTV services by leveraging its optical fibre network.

 R-Com is looking at inorganic ways to grow in the industry and is evaluating various acquisition possibilities despite losing the race for Hutchison Essar Ltd. We are currently evaluating a number of inorganic opportunities in select international markets to expand our footprint, Ambani said. 

 On Monday, the company announced the acquisition of Yipes Holdings for Rs 1,200 crore ($300 million). Giving shareholders a glimpse of the companys network expansion programme, Ambani said R-Com would cover almost 100 per cent of all rail routes, providing seamless voice, video and Internet connectivity.

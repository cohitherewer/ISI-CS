 New Delhi, Feb. 15: Infrastructure finance companies IDFC and IIFCL have joined hands with US financial firms Citigroup and Blackstone to launch a $5-billion infrastructure fund. 

 The fund will finance infrastructure projects in the country. It is estimated that India will require $320-350 billion in the next five years to develop infrastructure.

 We have joined hands with Citigroup and Blackstone to come out with a $5-billion infrastructure fund and we are also in talks with other investors for this fund, said M.K. Sinha, executive director (business development), Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC).

 The fund will be financed through $3 billion of debt and $2 billion of equity, said Sinha, adding the first close of the fund would be in the next couple of months.

 The fund would cater to telecom, power, oil and gas and other value-added infrastructure projects, Sinha added.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram said: This initiative is an important milestone in our search for innovative solutions to meet the challenge of financing the development of Indias burgeoning infrastructure sector.

 According to an agreement, IDFC, Citigroup and Blackstone will together invest $2.5 billion to provide equity financing. 

 The balance is likely to come from international investors as well as select domestic institutional investors, including India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) the government-owned special purpose vehicle for core sector funding.

 IDFC managing director Rajiv Lall said, We expect to raise equity over 18 months. Most of it will be raised abroad. The process will be launched in a couple of weeks.

 IDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said the countrys infrastructure requires a large amount of money. This money is not available in the domestic market. So we need to raise money abroad to finance big power projects, he said.

 The idea is to act as a catalyst for infrastructure financing although there are limits to which a particular project can be financed, Lall said. 

 Parekh said the fund is the outcome of the Indo-US CEO forums initiatives, adding that other such funds can be worked out with Japan and West Asia as well.

 To attract private investment in infrastructure and suggest innovative financial instruments, the government has set up a committee headed by the IDFC chairman, which is expected to submit a report before the Union Budget 2007-08.

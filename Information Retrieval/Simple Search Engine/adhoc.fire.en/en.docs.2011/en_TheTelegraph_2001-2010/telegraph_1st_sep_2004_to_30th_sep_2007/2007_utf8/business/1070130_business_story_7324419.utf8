The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Accenture to hire 8,000 more

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 29: Accenture is likely to recruit 8,000 more to ramp up its employee strength to 35,000 by August 31. Its headcount in India will then be more than that in the US.

 The global consulting firm now has 27,000 employees across six cities in the country.

 We will recruit across all practices in the country, including business consulting, technology services and business process outsourcing, said William D. Green, chairman and CEO of Accenture.

 Company officials, however, declined to comment on whether the company would expand to new cities to accommodate the new recruits. Accenture is now present in Bangalore (four offices), Pune, Hyderabad, Chennai, Mumbai (four offices) and New Delhi (two offices).

 The company has more than 15,000 employees at its Bangalore centre.

 At a staff strength of 35,000, India will become the largest country (in terms of headcount), surpassing the US (where it has about 30,000 employees), Green added.

 Accenture set up operations in Chennai in the beginning of 2005 and already employs more than 800 people. Chennai is an integral part of Accentures global delivery network, which leverages more than 40 delivery centres around the world to provide a complete range of consulting, technology and outsourcing services to clients across more than 30 industries.

 Green, who joined the company in 1977, termed the development as pretty impressive.

 Company officials said of the projected 35,000 workforce (representing a 52 per cent increase over last year), 10,000 would be in business process outsourcing.

 Accenture worldwide draws 40 per cent of its revenues from the outsourcing business, with the rest coming from business consulting and technology services.

 The company feels the entry of low-quality players to the booming business process outsourcing space could prove to be a roadblock for the industry as a whole, Green said. 

 Green, on his maiden trip to India, also praised the contribution of the Indian staff for the growth of the company, which globally generated net revenues of $16.65 billion for the fiscal ended August 31, 2006.

 Green believed that todays business leaders would be judged tomorrow by how well they move into and grow in emerging markets like India.

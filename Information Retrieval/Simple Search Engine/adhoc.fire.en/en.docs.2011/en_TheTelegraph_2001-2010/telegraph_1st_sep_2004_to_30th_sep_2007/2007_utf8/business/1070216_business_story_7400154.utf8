 HDFC ready to raise rates

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Mumbai, Feb. 15: Home loan rates are set to head north again. HDFC, a major player in housing finance, today announced that it is going to raise interest rates on its loans by 0.50 percentage points either from the end of this month or early March.

 After the recent hike in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) announced by the RBI, our margins have come under pressure and we will raise the interest rate to maintain that spread, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said. HDFC now enjoys a 2 per cent margin on housing finance.

 According to Parekh, the hike will not scare away genuine home buyers and the aim was to keep away investors who are keen to make a quick buck in the booming real estate market. 

 This will be the second time within a month that HDFC rates will go up. Earlier this month, the housing finance company raised rates by 50 basis points following a 25-basis-points rise in repo rate announced by the RBI in its monetary policy review on January 31. ICICI Bank had also raised home and car loans by one percentage point then.

 However, ICICI Bank has decided not to raise home loan rates now. The bank may increase interest rates incrementally across all segments of customers, including lending for automobile purchase. For housing loans, we are choosing not to increase rates for existing floating rate borrowers, ICICI Bank executive director V. Vaidyanathan, said.

 As admitted by Parekh, HDFCs move to review rates is a direct outcome of RBIs decision to raise the cash reserve ratio on Tuesday by 50 basis points to 6 per cent. 

 The decision has pushed up cost of funds and four nationalised banks Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, Union Bank of India and Bank of India have already decided to winch up their prime lending rates. 

 The rate hike by PSU banks will make loans costlier on a range of products, including personal loans, corporate advances, credit to small-scale industries and agriculture loans above Rs 2 lakh. These banks have, however, decided to spare home and car loans for the moment.

 After the Reserve Bank jacked up the repo rate in January, finance minister P. Chidambaram had instructed public sector banks to hold home loan rates.

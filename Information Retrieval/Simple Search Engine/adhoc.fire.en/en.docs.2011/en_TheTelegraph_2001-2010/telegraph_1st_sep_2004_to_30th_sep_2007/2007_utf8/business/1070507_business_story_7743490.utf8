 Wheat, edible oil imports on the cards

 KAKOLY CHATTERJEE

 New Delhi, May 6: India is likely to import up to 6 million tonnes of edible oil and 1 mt of wheat this year to bridge the supply shortfall in the commodities.

 Vijay Data of the Solvent Extractors Association of India said 3 mt of palm oil would be imported from Indonesia and 1 mt from Malaysia. There are also plans to import 1.8 mt of soyabean oil. About 75 per cent of the oil would come from Argentina and the rest from Brazil, Data said.

 India will meet nearly 45 per cent of its edible oils requirements through imports. By the end of this decade, the demand is projected at 15 mt. There is a ban on imports of oil seed, though this a cheaper option vis--vis edible oils.

 The government feels if oil seeds are imported, farmers may use it to grow crops. This will not remove the shortage. Besides, there are fears over the seeds bringing new diseases into India.

 Edible oil is used in cooking. Palm oil has a more diverse use, such as in soaps. 

 The government also plans to import 1 mt of wheat this year despite a bumper crop. The State Trading Corporation will import the wheat to meet the shortfall in procurement. The procurement is below the target, though output was at an all-time high. 

 Last year, the output was lower at 69.35 mt because of the bad weather.

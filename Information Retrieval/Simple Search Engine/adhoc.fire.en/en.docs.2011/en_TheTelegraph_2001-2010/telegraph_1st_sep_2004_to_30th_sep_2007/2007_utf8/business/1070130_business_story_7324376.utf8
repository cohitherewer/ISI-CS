 Ricoh to buy IBM arm for $725m

 Tokyo/New York, Jan. 29 (Reuters): Ricoh Co will pay $725 million to buy IBMs digital commercial printer business as the Japanese company aims to boost its presence in the $25-billion market, the two companies said on Thursday. 

 The deal, to be completed over three years, will give strengthen Ricohs position in the burgeoning market for digital commercial printers against rivals such as Xerox Corp and Canon Inc. Canon entered the market last year. Ricoh bought Hitachis printer business in 2004. 

 IBM, for its part, has been shifting its operations away from hardware to software and services. The US company sold its personal computer unit to Chinas Lenovo in 2005 and its hard disk drive business to Japans Hitachi in 2002. 

 This agreement is key to Ricohs efforts to become a leading global provider of output and print solutions, Ricoh chief executive and president Masamitsu Sakurai said in a statement. 

 IBM expects the proposed deal will boost 2007 earnings- per-share growth to the higher end of its previously disclosed 10 per cent to 12 per cent range. IBM shares rose 0.4 per cent to $97.81 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Ricoh shares closed 5.2 per cent higher at 2,540 yen after the Nikkei business daily reported the deal, outperforming a 0.28 per cent fall in the benchmark Nikkei average.

 The two companies agreed to initially set up a joint venture called InfoPrint Solutions Co, with Ricoh taking 51 per cent. The $725-million fee is considered a prepayment for that stake and the remaining 49 percent owned by IBM, which Ricoh will progressively acquire over three years. 

 InfoPrint will be based in Denver at the facility currently housing IBM Printing Systems. Tony Romero, general manager of IBM Printing Systems, will serve as chief executive of the new company, which will start with about 1,200 IBM employees.

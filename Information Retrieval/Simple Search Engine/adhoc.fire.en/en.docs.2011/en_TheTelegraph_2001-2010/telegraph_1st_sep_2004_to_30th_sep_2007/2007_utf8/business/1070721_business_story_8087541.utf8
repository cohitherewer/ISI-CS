 Rupee rise hits Satyam net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, July 20: Satyam Computer Services will become a $2-billion company and add 16,000 employees by fiscal 2008, according to its chairman and managing director B. Ramalinga Raju.

 The company has garnered revenues worth Rs 1,830 crore in the first quarter ended June 30, a growth of 24.26 per cent over Rs 1,461 crore in the same period a year ago.

 Satyam has posted a net profit of Rs 378 crore for the quarter ended June 30, an year-on-year increase of 6.8 per cent and a sequential decrease of 3.9 per cent.

 Raju said the rupee appreciation had left a 400-point negative impact on the performance in the first quarter of 2007-08. However, initiatives like hedging and price hikes have helped us bring it down to 64 points, he said. We have understated our revenues of Rs 138 crore because of the rupee appreciation, he said.

 The rupee has risen more than 9.5 per cent against the dollar this year, squeezing profits of software firms that earn 60 per cent of their revenues from the US.

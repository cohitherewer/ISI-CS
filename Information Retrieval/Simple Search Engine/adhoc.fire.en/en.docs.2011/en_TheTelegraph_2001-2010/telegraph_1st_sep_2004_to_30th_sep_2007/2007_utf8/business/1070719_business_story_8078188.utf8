 New Delhi, July 18: Ericsson has bagged Bharti Airtels Rs 8,000-crore contract to expand its GSM network and provide capacity management.

 The network expansion will help Bharti Airtel reach rural areas better. 

 The two-year deal is one of the largest contracts won by Ericsson, which manages around 70 per cent of Bhartis network in 15 circles. 

 Under the contract, Ericsson will design, plan, deploy and manage Bhartis GSM network across 15 circles and its pre-paid platform across 23 circles. 

 This contract is an important part of realising Bhartis vision of a converged network and of expanding coverage in rural areas to launch innovative voice and data services, said Mats Granryd, managing director of Ericsson India. 

 Ericsson will also deliver pan-India integrated device management solutions, enabling use of advanced data services by all mobile customers across retail and enterprise segments.

 The state-of-the-art network will allow us to offer more innovative products and solutions in voice and data such as community-based charging, location-based and enterprise services, said Manoj Kohli, president and CEO of Bharti Airtel.

 Vodafone stake

 Bharti Enterprises today acquired 4.99 per cent of Vodafones 5.6 per cent direct stake in Bharti Airtel. 

 In February 2006, Bharti Enterprises had announced it would buy Vodafones holding in Bharti Airtel for $1.6 billion. The stake was to be transferred in two tranches, the first before March 31, 2008 and the second by November 2008.

 Bharti has enhanced its voting interest in Airtel to over 50 per cent, Bharti said in a statement.

 Vodafone will continue to hold an indirect stake of 4.39 per cent in the company.

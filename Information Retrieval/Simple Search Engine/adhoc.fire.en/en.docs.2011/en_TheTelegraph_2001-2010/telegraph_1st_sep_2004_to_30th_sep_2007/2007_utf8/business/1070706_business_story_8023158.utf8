 DLF off to modest start

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 5: DLF Ltd today made a modest debut on the bourses even as it gained an entry into the top 10 valuable firms in terms of market capitalisation. 

 On the Bombay Stock Exchange, DLF opened at Rs 582 and closed at Rs 570.05, an 8.58 per cent premium to its issue price of Rs 525 per share. 

 The DLF debut was largely in line with analysts expectations that the company would list in the range of Rs 550 per share. 

 Most observers did not expect the company to trade at a high premium, given its valuation and worries about the property market cooling down. The face value of the DLF scrip is Rs 2 per share. 

 DLF is now the eighth largest company in terms of market capitalisation. DLFs market capitalisation is now at Rs 97,182 crore, more than double of Unitech, its real estate rival. 

 The promoters holding in DLF is over 87 per cent. The net worth of K.P. Singh and his family is around Rs 85,000 crore. Reliance Industries, ONGC, Bharti Airtel, NTPC and Reliance Communications are among the top five companies in terms of market capitalisation. 

 The DLF scrip touched an intra-day high of Rs 714.25 on the BSE but could not maintain this level. 

 More than 3.42 crore shares of the company were traded on the bourses today.

 Other real estate shares were also seen moving in tandem with DLF. Unitech, however, ended lower by over 5 per cent and Ansal Properties fell by 4.7 per cent. On the NSE, the DLF scrip opened at Rs 526.60, touched an intra-day high of Rs 583.95 and ended at Rs 569.80, an 8.52 per cent premium to its offer price. 

 DLFs land bank stands at little over 10,250 acres. A large part of this is in the metros, including Calcutta, and the National Capital Region.

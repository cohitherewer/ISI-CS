 Sarin: In a new role

 Mumbai, March 14: The Essar group and Vodafone are all set to announce a partnership deal for Hutchison Essar tomorrow. 

 The deal will see Ravi Ruia becoming chairman of Hutch Essar with Vodafone CEO Arun Sarin taking up the position of vice-chairman of the countrys fourth-largest cellular company.

 According to the agreement, the Essar group will have a put option for three to four years that will enable them to sell their 33 per cent stake to Vodafone within this period. 

 It is believed that the Ruias may sell their stake in Hutch Essar to Vodafone for at least the same price that the British telecom firm paid to acquire the 67 per cent stake in the telecom venture.

 Though a spokesperson of the Essar group refused to comment on the issue, sources said a formal announcement is likely to be made in New Delhi tomorrow and that Sarin may also join the Ruias in making the announcement.

 Sources added that it is a win-win deal for both sides with Sarin being successful in his efforts to persuade the Ruias to stay on in the venture and have a co-operative partner. 

 The Ruias were the founding shareholders of Hutch Essar and their presence in the company is considered crucial for Vodafone to understand the Indian telecom market. For the Ruias, most of their demands have been met.

 In February, Vodafone bagged a 67 per cent stake in Hutch Essar for over $11 billion. The Ruias had then announced that they had no intention of exiting the company. The group had also demanded that it did not want any dilution of its existing rights, including the right of first refusal. 

 The Ruias were also upset as Vodafone had not informed them of an agreement with Bharti Airtel over sharing of infrastructure.

 These issues have now been resolved with the Essar group understood to have given its green signal for infrastructure sharing. The group was also asking for more nominees on the board of Hutch Essar. It is now learnt that the Ruias will have three nominees on the companys board. 

 Asim Ghosh will continue to be the managing director of Hutch Essar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Realty smile amid sulk 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 No limits

 Calcutta, Feb. 9: Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), an international real estate management firm, has ruled out a correction in the Indian realty market.

 The NYSE-listed company, which manages assets worth over $40 billion in real estate globally, believes that the realty market is poised for further growth.

 JLLs view is contrary to many, including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which feels that the real estate sector is overheating in India.

 We do not expect the same kind of rise in property prices where it has jumped phenomenally. But this is good for the long term, Vincent Lottefier, country head, India, JLL, said.

 In the last 15-18 months, prices have increased indiscriminately across all properties. The time may have come when the weaker projects face a challenging time but good properties would continue to give good returns, he added.

 Speculative investment has pushed up rents from Rs 30-35 per sq ft to Rs 70 per sq ft in Gurgaon for commercial properties, raising fear of asset price bubble burst.

 The RBI and finance ministry have cautioned banks to squeeze lending to commercial projects to rein in prices.

 Despite people talking about correction for the last 12-15 months, prices have just gone up and up, Abhishek Kiran Gupta, senior manager (strategic consulting and research) of JLL, said.

 Developers have held back supplies and staggered their projects to match up with demand to realise good return.

 Various international agencies have invested around $10 billion in India on expectations of a high return. However, only $2 billion has been deployed so far, Lottefier said.

 City market

 JLL, which opened office in Calcutta today, said the city was on the global radar of multinational companies.

 The company is negotiating 600,000 sq ft of commercial properties in Calcutta at present with international banking/IT companies.

 Given that prices here are still attractive vis--vis tier I cities (Mumbai/Delhi), 30-40 per cent of any fund looking to invest in India will look at the Calcutta market too.

 Lottefier said the IT/ITeS industry is driving growth in Calcutta (Salt Lake/Rajarhat) where 4.5 million sq ft of additional supply is expected to be completed in 2007.

 The report also mentions that IT/ITeS will also drive retail and residential market in the city.

 JLL has projected Calcutta at the top of Indian tier-III cities like Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Indore and Nagpur which can be next successful cities in the IT sector.

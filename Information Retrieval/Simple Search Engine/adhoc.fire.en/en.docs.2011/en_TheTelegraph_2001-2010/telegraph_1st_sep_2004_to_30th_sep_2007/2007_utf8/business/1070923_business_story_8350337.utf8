 Rising rupee hurts Nalco

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Sept. 22: Public sector aluminium firm Nalco is losing around Rs 120 crore every month because of appreciation of the rupee. 

 The company also plans to tap the overseas market to raise 150 million euros (around Rs 900 crore). It has shortlisted the State Bank of India and Axis Bank among the bidders, chairman C.R. Pradhan said.

 The company is working on strategies to tackle the problem of the rupee rise, Pradhan said, adding that efforts were on to strike a balance between supply in the domestic and external market to neutralise the damage caused by the robust rupee.

 On external borrowings, Pradhan said Nalco will need an investment of Rs 5,003 crore for the second phase of expansion.

 It will import equipment worth Rs 1,500 crore from Europe.

 The projects are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2008. 

 The expansion plan will raise the capacities of its bauxite mines to 63 lakh tonnes, alumina refinery to 21 lakh tonnes, aluminium smelter to 4.6 lakh tonnes and captive power plant to 1,200MW.

 Nalco recorded a 24 per cent rise in sales turnover at Rs 6,515 crore in 2006-07 against Rs 5,324 crore the previous year. 

 Its net profit jumped 52 per cent to Rs 2,381 crore from Rs 1,562 crore a year ago.

 The Centre has also allotted a 70-million-tonne coal block for new units at its captive power plant. 

 The mining plan has been approved by the ministry of coal and a detailed project report has been prepared.

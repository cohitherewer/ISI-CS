 Sun Pharma gulps Israeli drug firm

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Shanghvi: Good work

 Mumbai, May 21: Sun Pharmaceutical will acquire Israeli drug major Taro Pharmaceutical Industries for $454 million in an all-cash deal.

 Taro Pharmaceutical, which gets 90 per cent of its sales from North America, is expected to help widen Suns presence in dermatology and paediatrics segments. Sun Pharmaceuticals has been scouting for opportunities globally to expand its generics offering.

 The Indian firm agreed to pay $7.75 per share, up 27 per cent from Fridays close of $6.10, valuing Taros equity at $230 million, Sun said in a statement.

 The remaining $224 million will go towards refinancing Taros debt.

 This is a good opportunity for Sun and Taro to work together to create increasing value and add a complementary multinational organisation to Suns business, Sun Pharmaceutical chairman and managing director Dilip Shanghvi said.

 The Sun stock surged Rs 50.95 to close at Rs 1,064.15 on the BSE today after the announcement.

 Sun Pharmaceutical will fund the buyout through internal accruals and proceeds from its earlier $350-million foreign currency convertible bonds issue.

 Two minority shareholders have moved an Israeli court to restrain Taro from concluding any deal that could hurt minority interests, Sun said, but hoped to overcome the hurdle.

 Franklin Advisers and Templeton Assets Management which hold 9 per cent of Taros equity had filed a filed a motion in the Tel Aviv district court on May 10 to prevent Taro from entering into any transaction, which might result in discrimination against minority public shareholders.

 Later on May 19, Franklin Advisers and Templeton filed a request with the court for a temporary injunction to prevent Taro from entering into any transaction. 

 Taro was expected to post a substantial loss for the year ended December 2006, Sun said, but it expected to turn it around.

 During 2005, Taros sales stood at $298 million, with a profit of $5.7 million. 

 Sun Pharma has always been looking at acquiring companies where there is an opportunity to turn them around, said an analyst.

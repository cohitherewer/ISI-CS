 Stalwarts come calling 

 JAYATI GHOSE

 New Delhi, Jan. 2: Global telecom firms Cisco, Alcatel and Flextronics are flocking to India for a piece of the $25-billion, and still growing, telecom equipment manufacturing industry.

 These telecom equipment manufacturers want to follow Nokia and LG into the Indian market, drawn by government incentives and the growing demand for telecom equipment.

 Cisco, of the US, is planning to invest over $1 billion to manufacture IP-based telephones in India. 

 Moreover, the firm has decided to shift 20 per cent of its top executives to India to make the country its global base. 

 The companys counterpart Alcatel will annually invest $200 million for the next few years to manufacture WiMax equipment.

 Flextronics, a $16-billion global electronics manufacturing services (EMS) provider, plans to invest $100 million to build a manufacturing facility in Sriperumbudur, Chennai. 

 This facility will be selected as an SEZ and will offer services such as plastic injection moulding, circuit-board assembly, distribution, logistics and repair.

 India, adding more than six million wireless subscribers per month, promises to be a market with a huge demand potential, an opportunity global telecom majors do not want to miss.

 Motorola, which has set up its unit in Chennai at an investment of over $100 million, will start production from the first quarter of 2007, while Ericsson has recently launched its R amp;D centre in Chennai. 

 The telecom equipment manufacturing sector, poised to rise to $100 billion in the next three years, has attracted huge investments from both domestic and foreign investors.

 Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association of India (Tema) chairman emeritus N. K. Goyal, said, The industry has already received an investment of $6 billion. In the next three years, the figure will grow to $18 billion.

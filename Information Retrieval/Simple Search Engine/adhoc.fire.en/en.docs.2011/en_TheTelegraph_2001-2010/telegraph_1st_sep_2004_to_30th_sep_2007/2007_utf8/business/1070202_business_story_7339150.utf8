 Tata Chem taste for fresh fruits

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 1: Tata Chemicals Ltd has joined hands with Europes Total Produce Plc (Total Produce) to distribute fresh fruits and vegetables to retailers and wholesalers.

 The two companies have formed a 50:50 joint venture to create distribution facilities for fresh fruits and vegetables across India. 

 Tata Chemicals said initially facilities will be set up at two centres in the north and east at a cost of Rs 26 crore. The company plans to expand this network later across the country.

 Total Produce is a leading fresh produce company and comprises the general produce business, which was demerged from Fyffes Plc in December 2006. 

 The group generates a turnover in excess of $2.5 billion and has close to 3,900 employees and trades from more than 80 facilities throughout Europe. Shares of Total Produce are traded on the Dublin and London stock exchanges. 

 Apart from chemicals and food additives, Tata Chemicals is present in the agri space. It has consolidated revenues in excess of $1 billion. The company has a network of agri service centres, branded as Tata Kisan Sansar (TKS), which have established relationships with growers through the provision of farm inputs and advice. 

 The company will use this experience to channel the produce from the source to the distribution facilities.

 TKS outlets, numbering over 500, are expected to give the company a unique advantage of being close to the producers.

 Dhunseri Tea stirs merger concoction

 Dhanuka: Thinking big

 Calcutta, July 23: Dhunseri Tea amp; Industries is set to merge its associate company, Tezpore Tea Company, with itself. 

 The Rs 1,200-crore group, which includes South Asian Petrochem Limited, is open to raising funds through a private placement. The merger will provide better synergy and greater economies of scale in managing our tea operations, said C.K. Dhanuka, chairman of Dhunseri Tea amp; Industries. The boards of the two companies will decide on the merger on July 30 and August 1. After the merger, Dhunseri Tea will become a Rs 100-crore player, he added.

 Dhunseri Tea has eight gardens in Assam while Tezpore has three in Assam and one in Dooars. Dhunseri Tea now produces 75 lakh kg tea and Tezpore 33 lakh kg per annum. After the merger, it will produce 10 million kg, of which 2 million kg will be orthodox tea.

 As of now, we do not plan to introduce alternate cropping or tourism activity. This is because tourism can be a difficult proposition in Assam while the scale of alternate cropping would not be large enough. We have more than 10,000 acres under tea operations, Dhanuka added.

 These gardens employ over 10,000 workers.

 While the average yield of Dhunseri gardens is around 2,400kg per hectare, the Tezpore gardens are a bit lower between 2,200 and 2,300kg per hectare. We will apply for the special purpose tea fund and the merged entity will provide more efficient economies of scale in terms of rejuvenation, replantation and cross cutting, Dhanuka said.

 The three brands of Assam Kala Ghoda, Lal Ghoda and Chhote Lal will be strengthened to generate more revenues. The group has four finance and investment companies, which hold stakes in group firms.

 The group is also exploring possibilities to consolidate its investment business under one umbrella comprising the four companies Mint Investments, Naga Dhunseri Group, Mayfair India and Plenty Valley Intra.

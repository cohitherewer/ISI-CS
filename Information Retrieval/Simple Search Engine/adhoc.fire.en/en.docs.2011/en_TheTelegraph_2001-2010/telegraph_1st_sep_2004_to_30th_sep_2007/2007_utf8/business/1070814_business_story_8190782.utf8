 New Delhi, Aug. 13: Six international designers and architects are interested in refurbishing the state-run India Tourism Development Corporations Ashok Hotel in Delhi.

 Australia-based Group GSA, Know Design from Paris, Design 103 International from Thailand, New Delhis Visions, JCJ Architecture and Fab Interiors are among those who have made presentations for redesigning 182 rooms of the 550-room hotel. 

 After facing a series of bureaucratic hurdles for nearly 14 months, six companies have given us corporate presentations for renovating the rooms. Work will begin in April next year, a senior ITDC official told The Telegraph.

 The hotel has already renovated 245 rooms and is in the process of refurbishing 60 more. We are certain that work will be over before the start of season (before September) this year, he said.

 According to the official, the lobby, corridors and the landscaping area will be renovated next year before the beginning of the peak season. 

 Besides, the company is also planning a makeover of 75 rooms at Janpath, 40 rooms at Samrat, 73 rooms at Ashok Jaipur and 40 rooms at Ashok Guwahati before the peak season begins this year.

 Another 150 rooms of the total 213 of Hotel Janpath will be renovated next year. While upgradation of the property in Jammu and Pondicherry will start next year, work has already begun for those located in Patna and Bhubaneswar, said the official.

 ITDCs annual profit rose to Rs 75.22 crore in 2006-07 from Rs 52.57 crore in the previous year. 

 Driven by its hotels business, ITDC has posted a 139.65 per cent jump in profit before tax for the first quarter at Rs 9.73 crore against Rs 4.06 crore in the same period last year.

 The hotel division of the company contributed Rs 7.42 crore to the total profit with Rs 6.09 crore from Delhi-based Ashok Hotels.

 During the divestment programme undertaken by the previous BJP government, ITDC divested 18 of its 33 hotels.

 The corporation plans to build a second convention centre with a seating capacity of 4,000. This will, however, be used both by Samrat and Ashok Delhi.

 The properties now under the ITDC banner include The Ashok, Samrat and Janpath in New Delhi, Ashok (Jammu), Patliputra Ashok at Patna, Ashok Jaipur, Brahmaputra Ashok (Guwahati), Kalinga Ashok (Bhubaneswar), Doniyo Polo Ashok (Itanagar), Ashok Ranchi, Lalita Mahal Palace (Mysore), Ashok Pondicherry, Lake View (Bhopal), Bharatpur Forest Lodge and Kosi tourist complex.

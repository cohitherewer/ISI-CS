 Food amp; beverages fare well

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 12: The food and beverages (F amp;B) sector is growing at a rate of 8.5 per cent. Semi-processed and cooked ready-to-eat foods, branded milk products, ice cream, wine and sugar have shown a growth rate of 20 per cent.

 With changing lifestyles and rising disposable incomes, branded, health and convenient food products are witnessing rapid growth. The market for branded foods is growing by 15-20 per cent across different segments of the industry, said a survey conducted by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

 The respondents to the survey confirmed that the F amp;B industrys buoyancy was caused by liberal policy measures and government initiatives.

 These include prioritising the development of the food processing industry to encourage commercialisation, value addition to agricultural produce and tax benefits.

 Moreover, fiscal incentive packages offered by Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal have enthused companies to set up manufacturing facilities in these states.

 Many companies have set up their units in backward regions to enjoy tax benefits. Such units get 10-year excise and five-year income tax exemptions under Section 80A. In terms of total output addition, the F amp;B sector has surpassed the IT and pharmaceutical industries.

 Total output additions in IT and pharmaceuticals between 1993 and 2000 were Rs 30,000 crore and Rs 15,000 crore respectively. Food manufacturing, however, recorded an output addition of Rs 90,000 crore during the period.

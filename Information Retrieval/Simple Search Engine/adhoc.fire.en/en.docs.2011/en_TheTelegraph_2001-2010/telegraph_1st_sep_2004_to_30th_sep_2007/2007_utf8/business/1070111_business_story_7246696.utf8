 New Delhi, Jan. 10: NYSE Group Inc and three other foreign investors have bought a 20 per cent stake in the National Stock Exchange, Indias biggest stock exchange. This is the latest in a wave of consolidation sweeping global exchanges. 

 The operator of the New York Stock Exchange, investment bank Goldman Sachs, private equity firm General Atlantic and SoftBank Asian Infrastructure Fund have each bought a 5 per cent stake in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) the maximum holding permissible in a deal valued at $460 million, NSE said on Wednesday. 

 This alliance marks a significant milestone for NSE in developing a place for itself in the emerging global scenario, NSE chief executive Ravi Narain told a news conference, adding that with more Indian firms looking to list overseas, it was natural that foreign exchanges were keen on a presence in India. 

 The New York Stock Exchange lists 10 firms from India. NYSE said it would pay $115 million in cash for its stake to a consortium of sellers, including ICICI Bank, IFCI, IL amp;FS, Punjab National Bank and General Insurance Corp of India. 

 Our investment complements our global growth strategy, NYSE chief executive John Thain said in a statement. 

 NYSE, which is also in the throes of a $14-billion merger with pan-European bourse operator Euronext, said it expected to close the purchase in the first quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approvals in India. 

 Merrill Lynch amp; Company was financial adviser to NYSE. 

 RBI has capped total foreign investment in stock exchanges at 49 per cent, including direct investment of 26 per cent and investments by portfolio investors of 23 per cent. 

 Surging trade

 NSE, owned by a set of financial institutions, banks and insurance firms, began operations in June 1994 with trading on the wholesale debt market. It then launched a capital market segment for equities and a futures and options (F amp;) segment. 

 Average daily turnover in its capital market segment in 2005-06 was nearly Rs 6,250 crore ($1.4 billion), while average daily turnover in the F amp; segment was nearly Rs 19,200 crore, its website showed. 

 Its 50-share S amp;P CNX index is the benchmark for derivatives trade in India, and last month hit a record high. 

 Local newspapers had recently reported that NYSE and Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. were in discussions with NSEs rival, Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). 

 BSE has set itself a deadline of May to reduce the stake held by brokers by offering 26 per cent to strategic investors and another 25 per cent through an initial public offering.

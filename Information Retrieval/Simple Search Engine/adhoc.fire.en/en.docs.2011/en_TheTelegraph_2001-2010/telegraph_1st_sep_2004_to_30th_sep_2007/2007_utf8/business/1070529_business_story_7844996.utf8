 CEO pay: Duo sing to Singh tune

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ravi (top) and Ahluwalia : For the 

 motion

 New Delhi, May 28: Issue: Corporate bosses are overpaid. 

 For the motion: Not Prime minister Manmohan Singh but two of his lieutenants plan panel deputy chief Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Vayalar Ravi, minister for overseas Indian affairs.

 Ahluwalia told a news channel today: I dont think the Prime Minister has talked about pay cuts. What he did say was that the corporate sector, if it wanted to create a perception that it was a socially responsible stakeholder, should look at the issue of excessive CEO compensation. He had not sought any cap on salaries.

 Ravi said: He (Manmohan Singh) is expected to talk about the people. The Prime Minister has not said anything wrong. 

 Ahluwalia said, I dont think he (the Prime Minister) said we wanted to cap salaries. I dont think he said salaries needed to be cut.

 What hes saying is that in a society where the government is trying to do its bit to push inclusive growth, there is no harm in the corporate sector thinking about some affirmative action.

 Given Ahluwalias proximity to the Prime Minister, his words must have come as a welcome relief to the captains of Indian industry.

 Ravi said Singhs advice should be seen in a positive light and read in the correct perspective. 

 He is expected to remind corporate houses about their responsibilities as he is the man who had opened up the domestic market and facilitated their growth in the country as the finance minister, Ravi said, dismissing corporate Indias response to Singhs comments.

 I think it is just a storm in a tea cup raised by the media. Singhs advice is natural as he has to take care of the poor.

 Ravi was responding to India Incs knee-jerk reaction to the Prime Ministers advice of paying lower remuneration to top CEOs and pulling them up for their ostentatious spending.

 The Union minister was speaking on the sidelines of a conference jointly organised by the ministry of overseas Indian affairs and the Confederation of Indian Industry.

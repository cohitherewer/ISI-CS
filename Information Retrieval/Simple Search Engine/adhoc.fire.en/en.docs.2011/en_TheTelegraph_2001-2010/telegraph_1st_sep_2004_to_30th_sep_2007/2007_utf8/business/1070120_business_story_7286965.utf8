 Blame it on food, fuel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 19: Oil has gone off the boil and the monsoon was pretty good this fiscal. So why has inflation shot through the roof?

 The biggest blame for inflation which is measured on the basis of the wholesale price index has been attributed to surging food and fuel prices, which seems a bit of a paradox.

 But the truth is that the full effect of rising oil prices which had surged all through 2006 hadnt quite seeped through the index because of what economists call a lag effect. So, it will be some time before rising fuel prices are no longer seen as an inflation-inducing factor that is assuming world oil prices remain pegged at current levels of just over $50 a barrel.

 The prices of jet fuel, naphtha and furnace oil are pegged to international prices of these products and, while they generally move in tandem with crude prices, there is a time lag between the movement as existing inventories play a crucial role. 

 While international crude prices have come down to $50 per barrel during the last three days the average for January 1-19 works out to $52.31 a barrel.

 Petroleum minister Murli Deora today said the government would reduce prices of petrol and diesel only if international crude prices stabilise at the level of $50 per barrel or lower. 

 International crude prices have been declining as the anticipated demand has turned out to be lower both in the US and Europe due to a mild winter.

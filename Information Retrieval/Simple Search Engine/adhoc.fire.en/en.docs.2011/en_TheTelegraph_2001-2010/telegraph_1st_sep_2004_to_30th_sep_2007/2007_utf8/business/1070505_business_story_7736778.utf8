 Bajaj sniffs scam in SEZ land acquisition

 Bajaj: Voicing concern

 New Delhi, May 4: Rahul Bajaj, chairman of Bajaj Auto and Rajya Sabha member, today accused leading industrial houses of turning land acquisitions for special economic zones into a scam.

 Bajaj said big corporate houses are almost turning it into a scam in the name of development. He, however, did not name the companies. 

 Farmers should be paid the right value and not subsidised rates for acquiring vast stretches of land, Bajaj said at a seminar organised by the Consumer Unity and Trust Society in the capital today.

 According to him, development of an industrial area does not mean it has to be near a city. It would be of more significance if the infrastructure creation takes place at a distance, providing an opportunity to promote auxiliary settlement, he added.

 P.C. Alexander, an independent Rajya Sabha member, echoed the sentiments of Bajaj. 

 However, Sharad Joshi, Rajya Sabha member and founder of farmers union Shetkari Sangathan, supported the SEZ policy.

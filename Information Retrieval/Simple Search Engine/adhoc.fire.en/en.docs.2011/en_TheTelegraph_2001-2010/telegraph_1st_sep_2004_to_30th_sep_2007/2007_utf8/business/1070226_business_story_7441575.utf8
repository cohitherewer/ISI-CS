 UTI Mutual adds glitter to gold funds

 VIVEK NAIR 

 Future bright

 Mumbai, Feb. 25: UTI Mutual Fund (UTIMF) is planning a slew of initiatives to make its gold exchange traded fund (GETF) more attractive. Few months down the line, investors with such units could exchange them in lieu of gold in banks. For some of the big players in equity markets, these units could also act as a collateral to trade in futures amp; options (F amp;). 

 These are only two such features which UTIMF hopes to offer to the GETF investors. Many more could be on the anvil as the concept catches on in the country. 

 The GETF will be open-ended through which investors can buy or sell gold units on the exchange. GETF is a mutual fund whose units can be traded on the stock exchange (in this case NSE) just like shares. Investors can own the units in demat form. However, at the time of redemption, units of the GETF can be exchanged for cash and not gold. 

 While one unit will represent one gram of gold on allotment, each unit will be backed by physical gold held by a custodian appointed by the mutual fund. The new fund offer (NFO) will commence on March 1 and close on March 12. Minimum investment for the GETF scheme has been kept at Rs 20,000.

 Speaking to The Telegraph, A.K. Sridhar, executive director, UTI Asset Management Company, said the fund house was planning to introduce more India-specific incentives for the scheme in the coming months.

 One such idea is that these units can be exchanged for gold at bank branches. Investors can now sell these units only for cash after it gets listed. However, with many banks having diversified into gold retailing, UTIMF is in talks with a few of them so that customers can even buy gold in lieu of these units. 

 We have asked the National Stock Exchange (NSE) to treat gold units as a collateral for F amp; trading. Investors now keep bank deposits as collateral. We have asked them to keep the gold units as a collateral, he added.

 Curiosity levels are very high for the product and we anticipate a good response, Sridhar added.

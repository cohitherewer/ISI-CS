 Dividend drought?

 After splashing out the moolah for several years, companies and mutual funds are expected to tighten their purse-strings, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 If you are looking for a regular dividend income from your investments in stocks and mutual funds, think again. Companies and mutual funds, which have been raking in profits over the past couple of years and rewarding their shareholders and unitholders with liberal dividend payouts, could now start tightening their purse strings.

 Blame it all on finance minister P. Chidambarams proposal to raise the dividend distribution tax (shortened to badly-labelled acronym DDT) in the financial year 2007-08. The hike in the dividend distribution tax is twofold the first is for companies and the second for mutual funds. 

 From April 1, companies will have to pay a 15 per cent tax on the payouts they announce or make in the form of either interim or final dividend to shareholders against 12.5 per cent at present. 

 Mutual funds will have to pay a higher tax of 25 per cent on dividend announced or paid to any category of investors under their money market and liquid fund schemes. The dividend distribution tax rate for debt schemes other than money market and liquid funds has, however, been kept unchanged at 12.5 per cent.

 At present, the dividend paid to corporate and institutional investors under money market and liquid fund schemes attract a distribution tax of 20 per cent, while its 12.5 per cent for individual investors. 

 The effective rate of dividend distribution tax will be more if we take into account the 10 per cent surcharge and 3 per cent education cess. 

 Companies have to pay the DDT on their distributed profit net of income tax. The corporate tax, which is 33.66 per cent (including surcharge and education cess) at present, will go up to 33.99 per cent from April 1, 2007. 

 Lets explain the situation. A company, say XYZ, earns a profit of Rs 100. Its after-tax earning will be Rs 66.01. If the company now wants to distribute the profit as dividend, shareholders can get only Rs 54.79 compared with Rs 56.75 at present. 

 In other words, the increase in dividend distribution tax from April 2007 will force companies to reduce their dividend payout by at least 1.96 per cent. In practice, companies may scale down their dividend payouts in the next fiscal by more than 2 per cent, experts believe. 

 The hike in dividend distribution tax will hurt public sector units more because they have been paying more than 33 per cent of their net profit as dividend to shareholders, including the government. 

 Holding companies in general will be more affected by the hike in the dividend distribution tax as it will translate into a double taxation first on receiving dividend from a domestic subsidiary company and second on payment of dividend to its own shareholders at a higher rate. 

 A drying up of dividend payouts by companies will also affect the income of equity-oriented mutual fund schemes in general and dividend yield plans in particular. 

 Mutual funds, however, expect the increase in dividend distribution tax for money market and liquid funds to reduce inflows, but they dont see it as a dampener that will diminish the appeal of these schemes. 

 Investors, particularly corporate and institutional investors, parked their short-term investible surpluses in money market and liquid funds for a better return than keeping the funds in bank deposits or other debt securities. 

 The dividend distribution tax on money market mutual funds and liquid funds has been increased in the budget to 25 per cent. This will definitely reduce the effective yields offered by the liquid funds. Banks will benefit because their deposits will not be relatively as unattractive as they are now compared to such funds.

 According to Ashu Suyash, managing director and country head, Fidelity, The increase in DDT on dividends paid by money market mutual funds and liquid mutual funds will have a near-term impact on funds in these categories.

 With banks raising rates to increase deposits, investors in liquid and money market schemes of mutual funds will find it more remunerative to park their funds with banks.

 New Delhi, Aug. 7: The government may soon come out with another bailout package for exporters hit by the appreciating rupee.

 Union commerce minister Kamal Nath today said, We are thinking of a new package for exporters. The appreciating rupee has impacted exports. Nath said the government was looking at measures to deal with the situation.

 According to officials, the commerce ministry has constituted a team to understand the impact of the rupee appreciation at the ground level and some more incentives could be announced for exporters by the end of this month. 

 The appreciating rupee has hurt export growth, which has come down to 14 per cent in June from 23 per cent in April. 

 In July, the government announced a Rs 1,500-crore package for exporters. However, the package benefits only employment-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather and small companies.

 Other sectors are now clamouring for similar benefits. The industry too is concerned about the rising rupee. 

 According to Ficci president Habil Khorakiwala, if the rupee appreciation is not corrected in another six months, industrial growth and gross domestic product will be affected.

 Assocham feels the goal of Indias exports reaching $160 billion this fiscal (2007-08) has become a distant dream.

 The chamber said the level of the appreciation of the rupee, which strengthened by 8.35 per cent during the first half of this year, was second only to the Brazilian currency, which appreciated by 9.28 per cent during the same period.

 Other currencies have also appreciated against the dollar, but not to this extent. The currency of Thailand appreciated by 7.56 per cent, Russia by 2.08 per cent, Malaysia by 1.98 per cent, China 1.82 per cent and that of Singapore, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan and South Korea by less than 1 per cent.

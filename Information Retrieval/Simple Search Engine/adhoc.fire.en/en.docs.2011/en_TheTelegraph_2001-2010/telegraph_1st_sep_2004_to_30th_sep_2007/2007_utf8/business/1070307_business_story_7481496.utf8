 Banks asked to reveal more on loans

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Mumbai, March 6: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today made it mandatory for banks and financial institutions to mention in the loan applications of borrowers the fees, processing charges and other details in a bid to check hidden costs and inject more transparency. 

 In a circular issued to commercial banks, the central bank also said that if a loan or credit card application is rejected, the banks and financial institutions should give in writing the reasons for it. 

 It said that hereafter all categories of loan applications, irrespective of the amount, should clearly state information about fee, processing charges, the amount of fee refundable in case of non acceptance of application, pre-payment options and any other matter which effects the interest of the borrower, it added. 

 The RBI also wants banks and FIs to work out a transparent policy in this regard with the approval of their boards. 

 Earlier, loan applications of priority sector advances up to Rs 2 lakh contained comprehensive details of fees and processing charges which has now been extended to all categories of loans. 

 Similarly, in case of rejection of a loan application, on all categories of loans irrespective of any threshold limits, including credit card applications, RBI said that banks and FIs should convey in writing the reasons which, in its opinion, led to rejection of the loan.

 Less liabilities

 The RBI today asked banks to reduce the concentration of liabilities (deposits) in their books to avoid systemic implications. 

 The RBI has warned banks, which have a high concentration of wholesale deposits to be aware of potential risks associated with this practice and frame policies to contain liquidity risk arising out of excessive dependence on such deposits. 

 In a circular issued here, the RBI has prescribed limits on inter-bank liabilities and asked banks to follow them from April 1. Those banks, which are not in a position to stick to the deadline will need to inform as to when they will be able to comply with the new norms. 

 Discussing the merits of the new measure, the RBI said that uncontrolled inter-bank liabilities could have systemic implications one banks problem could get passed on to another. 

 Uncontrolled liability of a larger bank may also have a domino effect. According to the new norms, inter-bank liability should not exceed 200 per cent of a banks networth as on March 31 of the previous year. 

 Individual banks may prescribe lower limit keeping in view their business model. Banks with a capital adequacy ratio of 11.25 per cent against the prescribed ratio of 9 per cent are allowed to have a higher limit up to 300 per cent of the net worth, the RBI has said.

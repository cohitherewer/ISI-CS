The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Post offices set for makeover

 New Delhi, Aug. 18 (PTI): The government has decided to introduce facilities such as forex counters, cargo services, access to instant money order and other revenue generating services in post offices in metropolitan cities.

 We have got the licence from the RBI to start foreign exchange business in some post offices in select metros. We are finalising the deal, which will soon be operational, S. Samant, chief general manager (business development) in the department of post, said.

 The department is acquiring an Air India plane to operate a dedicated cargo service in the Northeast. 

 The flight will take off from Calcutta every morning and return in the evening after delivery in Agartala and Imphal, Samant said.

 The postal department recently signed an MoU with the railways to sell train tickets in some of the post offices. Besides, it has undertaken the task of verifying pre-paid mobile subscribers in some areas, he said. 

 The future vision of the department of post is of a socially committed, commercially oriented and technologically driven organisation, which can deliver services to the farthest corners of the country at affordable rates, Samant said.

 There are about 1,55,669 post offices in the country with a significant number of employees. However, its core business of selling stamps and post cards has dipped over the past five years. To keep its market share intact, the department is also planning to set up a bank, which has been tentatively named the Post Bank of India.

 New Delhi, March 14 (PTI): Diversified business conglomerate Spice Group will invest Rs 500 crore in the next two years in its telecom retail venture Hot Spot Retail.

 We are planning to take the number of our Hot Spots to 400 by the end of this year and 1,500 by the end of 2008,with an investment of Rs 500 crore, Hot Spot Retails Private Ltd vice-chairman Dilip Modi told reporters here.

 The company also plans to increase its employee strength to 7,500 in the next two years from over 300 now.

 It has already set up 50 such outlets in Delhi and these retail chains will be the window to the telecom customers in India, Modi said.

 In the first phase, the company plans to expand its retail chain to Mumbai, Punjab and Karnataka.

 We are expecting to garner revenues worth Rs 800 crore next fiscal against Rs 200 crore now, he added.

 He said the company would introduce touch-and-feel demonstration for customers, rather than the traditional way of purchasing a mobile set after looking at a dummy.

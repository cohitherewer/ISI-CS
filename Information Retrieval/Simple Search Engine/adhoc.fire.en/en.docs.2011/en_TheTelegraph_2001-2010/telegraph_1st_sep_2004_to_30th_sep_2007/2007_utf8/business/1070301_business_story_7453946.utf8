 Every dog has its day, not aam aadmi

 GUEST COLUMN - Jagdish Shettigar 

 Mr P. Chidambaram had two positive factors working for him this year the annual growth rate of more than 9 per cent and the rise in revenue collection beyond the governments expectations.

 Despite the two positives, the finance minister has failed to initiate corrective measures urgently needed especially on the inflationary pressure and the farm sector crisis.

 People are under tremendous pressure of inflation, especially due to rise in prices of essential commodities, mainly foodgrain, pulses and vegetables.

 This was acknowledged in the Economic Survey and President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams address to Parliament. These developments led to expectations that the government would initiate steps to contain inflation.

 However, the budget is a dampener. It seems the government has not been able to diagnose the reasons for the unprecedented price rise.

 Of course, banning forward trading in foodgrain yesterday was a step in the right direction. But this too came after almost a year of constant demands not just by the Opposition but even by UPA allies.

 The other main factor leading to rise in foodgrain prices is hoarding by traders who got the green signal to play mischief by the governments inability to intervene in the market in view of inadequate stocks. The stocks were depleted because of the governments failure to procure foodgrain. Competition from private traders, especially organised retailers who offer at least Rs 100 more than the minimum support price (MSP) paid by the government, has been a big factor.

 The least one had expected was a review of the MSP policy. We need to make it flexible for the government to negotiate better. Though the minister initiated the debate, no clear measure was outlined.

 Another issue that needed to be urgently addressed was the farm sector crisis, with farmers committing suicide.

 But the indifference with which the issue has been treated makes one wonder whether even electoral considerations the country is inching towards parliamentary elections, and polls in Uttar Pradesh are round the corner do not move the government.

 The only step outlined was on fertiliser subsidies. Even here, he seems to be paying mere lip service. Of more than Rs 30,000 crore spent in the name of farmers, over 50 per cent is siphoned off by fertiliser companies. What Mr Chidambaram did was to claim he intends to provide fertiliser subsidy directly to the farmers. Ironically, he said he had gained the consent of the fertiliser industry, which makes his intention suspect. 

 In most other areas concerning the aam aadmi the housing sector, where interest rates have gone up and EMIs are not as easy as they should be, and tax relief for common taxpayers especially when revenue collections have risen the government has been unsparing. The common man has been clearly betrayed. While the aam admi suffers from accelerated prices of food items, the finance minister has shown generosity only towards dogs by making Pedigree cheaper!

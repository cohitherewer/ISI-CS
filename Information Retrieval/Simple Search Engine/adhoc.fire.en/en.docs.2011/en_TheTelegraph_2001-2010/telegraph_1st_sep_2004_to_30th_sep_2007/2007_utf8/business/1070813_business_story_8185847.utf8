 DoT dials spectrum norms

 JAYATI GHOSE

 NEW RINGTONE

 New Delhi, Aug 12: The department of telecommunications (DoT) will issue guidelines on efficient utilisation of spectrum.

 The DoT has sought recommendations from telecom regulator Trai. It has also set up an internal committee for better call quality within buildings to ensure mobile operators use their allocated spectrum efficiently. 

 There have been demands for more spectrum in recent months. However, defence forces, which hold rights to large chunks of spectrum, are reluctant to vacate this scarce resource. 

 Experts said most telecom companies were unable to use spectrum properly. According to them, the companies do not have the infrastructure to use their allocations appropriately. However, telecom firms have denied this suggestion. 

 The DoT is advocating the use of simple technologies for a better coverage within buildings. One is the use of mobile signal boosters and repeaters to send signals deep inside a building such as to basements and top floors of high-rises. 

 These places tend to receive signals from more than one external cell site around the building, resulting in frequent call drops and patchy conversation, said officials. 

 An efficient utilisation of resources is important because of the limited availability of spectrum and an increasing demand from cellular service providers.

 The department plans to ask operators to reserve a part of the spectrum only for coverage inside buildings.

 These solutions for in-building coverage are being successfully implemented in some European countries, said officials.

 Since most mobile phones are used indoors, operators can also deploy fixed-mobile convergence technologies. This will allow a user to shift to another technology, such as Wi-Fi, that uses a different frequency band while inside a building, the officials said. 

 Users now get a single-frequency band to make or receive calls, irrespective of whether one is indoors or outdoors. 

 The DoT is planning to study models in other countries to define a roadmap for operators, said the officials. 

 The DoTs committee will work in the lines of the spectrum efficiency working group set up in the US in 2002, which suggests regulatory models and incentives for efficient use of airwaves. 

 It discourages inefficient utilisation by clearly defining expectations.

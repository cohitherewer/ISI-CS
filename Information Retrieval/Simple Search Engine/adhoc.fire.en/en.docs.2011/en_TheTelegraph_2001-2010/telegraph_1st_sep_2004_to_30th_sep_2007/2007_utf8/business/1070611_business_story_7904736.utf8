 RBI to revamp price index

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 10: The Reserve Bank of India is working on a new price index that will reflect not only the wholesale prices but also the cost of living of rural and urban workers.

 The apex bank uses the wholesale price index (WPI) a measure of producer prices as the inflation indicator for work on monetary policy. It monitors four more indices: for industrial workers, urban non-manual employees, agricultural labourers and rural labourers. 

 All these indices will be reflected in the new harmonised consumer price index.

 The consumer price index is generally preferred worldwide as an indicator of inflation for monetary policy. 

 At a meeting of the Banco Central de Chile last week in Mumbai, the RBI governor Y.V. Reddy said the consumer price index was not appropriate for India. Given the widely different consumption baskets between the rich and the poor, between the rural and the urban areas and even across regions in the country, a single CPI index could be less representative.

 Reddy said these problems made the wholesale price index more relevant for India.

 However, the growing importance of services in the consumption basket makes the WPI less representative of inflation. There are occasions when the divergence between WPI and CPI is larger than usual. In view of these considerations, we are doing technical work on computing a harmonised consumer price index and we are in consultation with the government in this regard, Reddy said.

 Taming inflation and managing inflation expectations are a priority of the central bank since 2004-05. 

 A growth rate of over 8 per cent along with an increase in money supply had once pushed inflation to more than 7 per cent. The guiding criterion for including a variable in the inflation indicator will be the information content on future inflation, Reddy said. 

 This will necessitate collection of a wide range of information on a particular commodity. The information will relate to the fluctuation of production vis--vis a desired target, capacity utilisation, corporate performance, investment expectations. 

 According to the RBI governor, the apex bank has so far not favoured an inflation-targeting framework.

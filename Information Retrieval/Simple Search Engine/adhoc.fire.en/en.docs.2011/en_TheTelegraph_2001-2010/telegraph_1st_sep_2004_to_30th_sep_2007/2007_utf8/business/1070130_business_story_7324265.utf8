 New Delhi, Jan. 29: Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) sees its retail business fetching Rs 1,00,000 crore in sales over the next four to five years.

 The company today opened nine Reliance Fresh stores in five satellite towns around the national capital region to sell vegetables and groceries. The stores have been structured on the lines of international retail giants Wal-Mart and Safeway.

 Reliance will bring its retail chain to Calcutta by April. The company, however, did not divulge further details.

 Reliance has opened 49 stores so far across the country. By December, it aims to open 1,000 stores. The domestic retail market estimated at about Rs 9,00,000 crore per year is currently dominated by more than 12 million mom-and-pop shops.

 By 2010-11, our total revenue should be in the region of Rs 1,00,000 crore, said Raghu Pillai, chief executive of the companys retail business.

 Bigger format stores such as hypermarkets, supermarkets and speciality stores would be opened in the April-June quarter, he said.

 Of the nine outlets inaugurated today, four are in Ghaziabad, two in Greater Noida and one each in Gurgaon, Noida and Faridabad.

 Reliance has lined up investments worth Rs 25,000 crore for the next five years for its retail business, of which it intends to spend Rs 8,000 crore for its NCR project.

 Pillai also said large, air-conditioned stores remain a rarity in India, even as rising middle-class incomes and an increase in demand for branded products are driving a retail surge in India. Organised retail selling through company-owned stores currently accounts for just over Rs 360 crore of the total retail sector.

 After opening outlets in Chennai, Jaipur and Hyderabad and now Delhi, the company is planning to set up Reliance Fresh retail chains in all the tier I and II cities in the country. Reliance is gearing up to face competition from Wal-Mart stores, which has recently tied up with Bharti Enterprises to enter the Indian retail business.

 According to Reliance, knowledge and understanding of the Indian market gives the company an edge over Wal-Mart. Also, the company is confident of keeping prices of products at its stores competitive. It will be a combination of price and how well we will execute our model, Pillai said.

 Vodafone to sell 5.6% in Airtel for $1.6 bn

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mittal: Shared platform

 New Delhi, Feb. 12: Vodafone today said it would sell a 5.6 per cent stake in Indias top mobile operator, Bharti Airtel, for $1.6 billion and unveiled plans to share network infrastructure with Bharti to rein in costs.

 Vodafone will, however, continue to hold an indirect 4.4 per cent economic interest in Bharti Airtel through its 26 per cent direct stake in Bharti Infotel Pvt Ltd. Vodafone said it would hold this stake as a financial investor and would not have any representation on the companys board or management rights.

 According to a telecom department official, the 4.4 per cent indirect stake in another telecom firm is in accordance with the countrys telecom regulations. Since the 4.4 per cent interest is less than the stipulated 10 per cent holding rule, it is technically all right for the British telecom firm to have equity holding in another company in India, said the official.

 At the same time, Vodafone has also signed a network sharing agreement with Bharti, which could provide big savings and, therefore, help the group meet its financial criteria on its current acquisitions.

 Pursuant to Vodafone acquiring a controlling interest in Hutchison Essar, the Bharti Group has an arrangement to buy the 5.6 per cent direct interest of Vodafone in the company for $1.6 billion, said Sunil Mittal, chairman, Bharti Airtel. He said the deal was on a deferred payment basis. In 2005, Vodafone had bought a 10 per cent stake in Bharti for $1.5 billion. 

 If Bharti does not exercise the option, Vodafone will be free to sell the stake to a third party.

 Infrastructure sharing will reduce the total cost of delivering telecom services, especially in rural areas, enabling both Vodafone and Bharti to expand network coverage more quickly and offer more affordable services, said a Vodafone spokesperson.

 Moreover, Bharti Airtel will be the preferred vendor of Vodafone for national long distance, international long distance and leased line services. The British telecom firm will also give 50 per cent of its in-bound international roaming traffic to Bharti Airtel for three years. The two companies will also work on a comprehensive range of significant infrastructure sharing options, including around 70,000 towers in India, enabling rapid network expansion to connect sub urban and rural areas across India.

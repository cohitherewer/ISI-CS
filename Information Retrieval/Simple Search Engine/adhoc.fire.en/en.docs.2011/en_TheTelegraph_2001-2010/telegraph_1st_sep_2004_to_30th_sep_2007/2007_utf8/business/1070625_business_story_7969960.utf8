 Mumbai, June 24: Chevron will have a full-time director on the board of Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) from July 16. J.S. Bindra, who is an additional director from Chevron, will now become a permanent director. 

 Last year, Chevron picked up a 5 per cent stake in Reliance Petroleum. Under the deal, Chevron reserves the right to increase its stake to 29 per cent.

 Reliance Industries is the largest shareholder in RPL with a 75 per cent stake. Reliance Petroleum will have a capacity of 580,000 barrels per day, making it the sixth largest refinery in the world.

 RPL will move a special resolution to gain shareholders approval in its annual general meeting on July 16. 

 The company wants to change the articles of association to enable Chevron to nominate one director on RPLs board. Chevron will enjoy this power as long as it retains the ownership of all the investments it had initially done in RPL.

 Moreover, the nominee director will not be liable to retire by rotation. Chevrons nominee, Bindra, will also have the right to nominate an alternate director on the board of RPL.

 RPL will also move an ordinary resolution proposing the appointment of Bindra as director. There are nine members on the board of RPL. They are chairman Mukesh D. Ambani, Hital Meswani, Manoj Modi, P.M.S. Prasad, Y.P. Trivedi, Mahesh Modi, Atul Dayal, Bobby Parikh and Bindra.

 Initially, Chevron picked up 22.50 crore shares of RPL that translated into 5 per cent of its equity. 

 There was speculation in the past few months that the US refining and exploration giant would raise this stake shortly.

 The refinery is being implemented at a cost of Rs 27,000 crore and has been financed through a mix of equity and debt. The project, which also includes a 0.9-million-tonne propylene facility, is expected to be completed on schedule by December 2008.

 Till March 31, RPL had utilised Rs 18,939 crore. It had earlier raised $2 billion through foreign currency loans to part-finance the expenditure.

 Mukand in JV with Belgian firm

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 5: Mukand Ltd has entered into a 50:50 joint venture with Belgium-based NV Bekaert SA, the worlds largest steel wire manufacturer.

 Mukand and NV Bekaert will together invest Rs 100 crore in the joint venture firm, Mukand Bekaert Wire Industries Ltd. The company said it is setting up a stainless steel wire manufacturing plant on 25 acres at Lonand, Maharashtra. 

 The plant will have an annual production capacity of 12,000 tonnes and will be operational by 2009. The unit will manufacture various grades of steel wires, which can be used in welding, weaving and springs. 

 The steel wire market in this country is growing at a rate of 10 per cent. We have decided to set up this plant in India as cost of production and import duties are low here. Almost 85 per cent of our wires will be exported. We expect a turnover of around Rs 60 crore from this business, Niraj Bajaj, chairman and managing director of Mukand, said.

 Bekaert, which has been present in the country for over a decade, has a manufacturing plant in Pune, where it produces steel cords for radial tyres and carding products for the textile industry. After todays agreement, Bekaert will be able to double its steel wire manufacturing capacity.

 The Rs 100-crore investment will be through a mix of debt and equity, with a 50 per cent participation of debt, and Rs 25 crore as equity capital from each company.

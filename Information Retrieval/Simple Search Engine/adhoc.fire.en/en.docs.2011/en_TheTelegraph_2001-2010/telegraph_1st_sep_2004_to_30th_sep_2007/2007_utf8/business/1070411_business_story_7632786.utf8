 Suzlon ups REpower bid

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Mumbai, April 10: Suzlon Energy has raised its offer for Germanys REpower Systems to 150 euro per share, valuing the company at $1.65 billion (1.20 billion euro). 

 The offer price is 7 per cent more than the bid made by Paris-based Areva at 140 euro per share. 

 Suzlon has joined hands with the Martifer Group, REpowers second-largest shareholder, for the bidding. 

 The company today announced that the offer price has been raised by Suzlon Windenergie GmbH, the bidding company, and Martifer. 

 It added that SE Drive Technik GmbH, a company acting in concert with the bidding company, purchased REpower shares for up to 150 euro per share during the Easter holidays. 

 Suzlon had bought close to 6.27 lakh REpower shares, which is around 7.7 per cent of the share capital of REpower.

 The new price is at a premium of 19 per cent over the 127 euro initially offered by Suzlon Windenergie GmbH. 

 The price is also 68.4 per cent more than the average weighted share price in the last three months prior to the announcement of Suzlons takeover offer for REpower on February 9. The offer period expires on April 20. 

 Areva has not yet responded to Suzlons latest move, but reports suggest the French company may raise its offer price over the next few days. 

 Tulsi Tanti, chairman and managing director of Suzlon, said: Our offer price of 150 euro per REpower share is very attractive for all shareholders. The decision to increase the offer was taken after careful analysis and review of potential synergies which Suzlon could contribute to REpower.

 Andre Horbach, group CEO of Suzlon, added that REpower will remain a highly strategic asset from the geographical point of view. Moreover, it will offer a good onshore and offshore product mix. 

 Suzlons share finished in the positive territory on the BSE today. The share ended at Rs 988.90, up 0.17 per cent over its last close of Rs 987.25. 

 Prabhudas Lilladher, a local brokerage, downgraded the stock to an underperformer, after Suzlon increased the offer price.

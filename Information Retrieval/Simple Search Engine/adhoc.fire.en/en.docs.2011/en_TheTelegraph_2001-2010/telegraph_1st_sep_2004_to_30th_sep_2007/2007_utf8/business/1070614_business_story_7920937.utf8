 More food parks

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 13: The government plans to set up five food parks in partnership with private players in the next two years at a total cost of Rs 500 crore.

 Subodh Kant Sahai, minister of state for food processing, said after these parks, the government planned to set up five more by the end of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan.

 The size of the parks will range between 10 and 100 hectares. Sahai said they would have an SEZ status.

 Since investments for such parks are hard to come by, Sahai said the special purpose vehicle (SPV) route would be followed.

 The government will set up an SPV fund in collaboration with private companies or associations and borrow funds from banks and institutions to invest in the parks. 

 Farmers associations, retailers, private investors, state governments and the Centre will be on the board of directors of these SPVs. 

 The government may ease out of the management of the SPV after the parks become fully operational, said Sahai. The state government can contribute in terms of money or land as equity.

 Sahai said the food parks would have a complete operational chain connecting farmland with cold storage, transport logistics, processing units and markets.

 Akzo Nobel sweetens ICI bid

 London, Aug. 6 (Reuters): Dutch chemicals group Akzo Nobel has won access to Imperial Chemical Industries books after raising its indicative bid for the British maker of Dulux paints to 8 billion ($16.3 billion).

 The two firms today said Akzo, which has teamed up with German consumer goods firm Henkel for the bid proposal, was now offering 670 pence a share in cash, up 3 per cent from the 650 pence a share rejected by ICI last week.

 Buying ICI will strengthen Akzos leading position in the worlds $85-billion-a-year coatings industry, giving it a market share of about 15 per cent and increasing its exposure in North America and emerging markets, as well as in decorative coatings.

 But some analysts think Akzo, which makes Crown paints, is offering a full price and could face opposition from its shareholders. It could also face a bid battle, after a source familiar with the matter said last week that US group Dow Chemical was interested in bidding for ICI.

 The biggest hurdle remains approval of the deal by Akzo shareholders. We estimate the chances are better than evens, but difficult to call, Collins Stewart analyst James Knight said.

 At 1055 GMT, ICI shares were up 1.3 per cent at 640 pence. Akzo rose 0.4 per cent, while Henkel fell 1.1 per cent.

 Petercam analyst Jan Van den Bosshe said access to ICIs books was an important step as it could allow Akzo to identify more synergies. 

 More synergies can also make the bid price more acceptable to Akzo shareholders, he wrote in a research note.

 Akzo first proposed a bid at 600 pence a share for ICI in June, and then teamed up with Henkel, the maker of Persil detergents in Germany, for its last two proposals.

 If the deal goes ahead, Henkel will buy ICIs adhesives and electronic materials units for 2.7 billion, around the top end of market forecasts.

 Britains Takeover Panel has set Akzo a deadline of Thursday to make a firm offer for ICI or walk away.

 Sources familiar with the matter said both sides were aiming to reach a deal by then, but ICI had not ruled out asking for an extension or removal of the deadline.

 Under the proposed offer, ICI shareholders will also receive a second interim dividend of up to 5 pence paid on a pro rata basis from July 1 to the date of completion.

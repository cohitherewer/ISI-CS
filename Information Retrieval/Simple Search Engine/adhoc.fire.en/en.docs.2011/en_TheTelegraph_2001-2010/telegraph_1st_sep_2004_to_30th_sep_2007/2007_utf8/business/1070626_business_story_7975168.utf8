 ONGC ready for Nagaland

 JAYATI GHOSE

 New Delhi, June 25: ONGC is planning to resume operations in Nagaland, despite threats from Naga separatists and some youth groups. 

 With the Nagaland government providing us support and security, we are planning to go ahead with feasibility reports and will resume oil exploration as soon as the study is complete, A.K. Hazarika, director-onshore, ONGC, told The Telegraph.

 Intimidation by the separatist outfit, National Socialist Council of Nagalim, and the Naga Students Federation had forced the PSU to leave the state in 1994. 

 Dissatisfied groups will always remain, however, we are confident that our partner Canoro will be able to start drilling by next year, said Hazarika. Canada-based Canoro Resources is ONGCs exploration partner in the state. 

 Since Nagalands geology is similar to the foothills of Rocky Mountains in Canada, an area familiar to Canoro, we have entered into a contract with them for drilling in Nagaland, said Hazarika.

 ONGC has also made the state government a stakeholder in the exercise. One of the six blocks in Nagaland produces oil; the rest are exploration fields. The state government has given the permission to the ONGC-Canoro combine to resume work in the six blocks. 

 The Isak-Muivah faction of the NSCN has said exploration activities would not be allowed without the approval of the local communities.

 Lever lifts Assam factory lockout

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Dibrugarh, Sept. 2: Hindustan Unilever Ltd has bought peace with restive workers of its personal products factory in Assam, ending a 50-day lockout during which one of the union leaders who had spearheaded the unrest committed suicide. 

 The gate to the factory in Doomdooma will reopen at 11am tomorrow, Lever announced at the end of a marathon meeting between company officials and representatives of the newly floated Hindustan Unilever (Personal Products Factory) Sramik Sangha. It took 14 hours of negotiations at Tinsukia Circuit House since last evening for the deal to be struck. 

 Lever agreed to pay Rs 200 a month to each worker as settlement implementation allowance with effect from April, in return for which the union promised to maintain discipline.

 The formation of the union, supported by Intuc, was the first step towards reconciliation. Lever had refused to sit for discussions with the Citu-backed Hindustan Lever Workers Union. 

 The new union has 370 members, more than half of the 692-strong factory workforce.

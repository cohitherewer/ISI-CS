 IT exports on Bengal priority list

 JAYATI GHOSE

 FUTURE PLANS

 New Delhi, Sept. 23: The Bengal government aims to increase the states share in IT exports from the country to 15 per cent by 2010. 

 Bengal also plans to create 200,000 additional jobs in the infotech industry by that time.

 At present, Calcutta contributes only 2 per cent to software export earnings compared with Bangalores 33 per cent, Chennais 14 per cent and Navi Mumbais 8 per cent.

 IT exports from the country stood at Rs 1,44,214 crore in 2006-07, spread across 46 software technology parks that provide tax incentives for export-related businesses.

 IT companies such as Infosys, Wipro and TCS have made a beeline for land in and around Calcutta either to set up shop or to expand operations. However, issues such as Nandigram, frequent bandhs and poor infrastructure are deterring Calcutta from achieving its potential in software exports.

 Bengal has more than 250 companies registered under the Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) scheme. The companies have around 50,000 employees.

 Officials said the state has set such a challenging target because of the citys proximity to academic institutions such as the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. 

 Moreover, IT companies are getting increasingly interested in setting up and expanding operations in Bengal. They are drawn by low-operating costs, which includes cheaper land, in Calcutta compared with other metros, said officials. 

 Bangalore-based Wipro Technologies and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) have asked the state government for 40 acres each to set up special economic zones, while Infosys Technologies has asked for 100 acres. TCS has got its share, but the government is yet to find land for the others.

 Other firms keen to increase their footprint in the state are back-office firm IBM Daksh, software firms Accenture, HCL Technologies, Cognizant and Genpact. Accentures Calcutta centre will be its largest in Asia.

 Convergys, HCL Infotech and Patni are also in talks with the state government for setting up centres in the city.

 The state has around 20 million sq ft of office space under construction, 20-30 million sq ft proposed for satellite hubs and 8-10 special economic zones proposals from various tech firms.

 Bengal is also planning to set up two IT-specific SEZs at Rajarhat and Kalyani to keep its contribution in IT exports intact after the expiry of the STPI scheme in 2009. We are applying to the Centre for a formal approval for these two proposals, said officials.

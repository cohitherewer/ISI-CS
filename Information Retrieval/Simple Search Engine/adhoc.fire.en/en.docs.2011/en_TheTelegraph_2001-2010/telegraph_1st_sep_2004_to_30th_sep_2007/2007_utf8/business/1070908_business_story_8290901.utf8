 Aviation gains altitude

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 7: The Indian civil aviation sector is growing rapidly and can generate three million jobs in 10 years, Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel said at the 34th national management convention of the All India Management Association (AIMA) and the Asian Association of Management Organisations (AAMO).

 The minister said the sector had the potential to attract investments worth $150 billion in the next 10 years. A new policy will be framed to help the growth in this sector.

 Patel said the domestic aviation industry had 125 operating aircraft three years ago. There are more than 350 of them now, and the number is expected to cross 1,000 in five years. 

 Three years ago, 50 cities were connected by flights. Now the number has risen to 80, he said.

 Patel said by 2020, India would have 500 airports, including a number of merchant (private) ones. 

 The Tatas have already proposed to set up an airport. 

 He said the new daily Air Deccan flight from the city to Jamshedpur is doing well.

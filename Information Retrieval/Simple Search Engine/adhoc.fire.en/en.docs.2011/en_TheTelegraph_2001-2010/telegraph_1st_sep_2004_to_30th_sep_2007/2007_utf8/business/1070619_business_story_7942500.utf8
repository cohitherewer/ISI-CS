 SpiceJet rubbishes reports of share sale

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 18: SpiceJet today said it did not have any plan to sell its stake in the airline. It was reacting to news that Paramount was interested in buying a 26 per cent stake in SpiceJet and Kotak would back the bid. 

 The report on a television channel said the bid would be funded through internal accruals and debt and a due diligence exercise was in progress. 

 The speculative Paramount-SpiceJet deal is valued at Rs 500-600 crore. Paramount is a regional airline from the south.

 SpiceJet denied the speculation in an official statement that said, There is absolutely no plan to sell any stake in the company to anybody at all.

 SpiceJet is one of the best funded airlines in the country with a large cash reserve to pay for its expansion. There is absolutely no need to raise funds right now, the statement added. 

 SpiceJet said: Our financial strength can be gauged from the fact that the company recently placed orders for 10 Boeing 737-800s at a cost of $700 million at list price. 

 The major stakeholders of SpiceJet are Istithmar Holdings with a 13.42 per cent holding. Kansagras holds 12.91 per cent, while SpiceJet director Ajay Singh owns 4.16 per cent of the company. 

 In January this year, SpiceJet raised $67 million through a preferential allotment. 

 The shares have a lock-in period of 12 months from the allotment date, which was January 11.

 Kingfisher chairman Vijay Mallya had recently told reporters that he was interested in the company. 

 He said, If you ask me whether I am interested in SpiceJet the answer is most certainly yes.

 GoAir 

 Jeh Wadia-controlled GoAir today said it was not in talks with Paramount Airways for a stake sale.

 Information surrounding any kind of meeting between GoAir and Paramount regarding enterprise valuation is baseless and holds no ground, quot; Wadia, managing director of GoAir, said responding to reports on Paramount Airways picking up a stake in the budget airline.

 Wadia said his airline, which currently operates 396 weekly flights to 11 airports across the country, would implement its expansion plans during the medium to long term.

 GoAir is believed to have the highest load factor for the fifth consecutive month with the May figure at 86 per cent, quot; he added. 

 He went on to say, Am I talking? The answer is no. Am I going to get it? The answer is I dont know.

 He said he respected the independence of SpiceJet shareholders and its board. 

 If they want to do something, I am sure they will invite me to talk with them. If they dont want to do anything, we will just work together. Part of my strategy in acquiring Air Deccan was to make sure that the industry became more profitable and everybody worked together to achieve that. So either way it was a win-win situation. 

 Mallyas UB Group recently bought a 26 per cent stake in the low-cost carrier Air Deccan. Although Deccan had earlier said it was not interested in selling a stake to Kingfisher, the deal eventually came through.

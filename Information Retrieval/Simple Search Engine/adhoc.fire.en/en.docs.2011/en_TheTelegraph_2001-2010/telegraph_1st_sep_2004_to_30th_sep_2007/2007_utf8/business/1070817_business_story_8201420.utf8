 IDBI avoids Dabhol

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 16: IDBI will not make any further investments in the Dabhol power project.

 IDBI chairman and managing director Yogesh Agarwal today said, We have made enough investments in that project and we are not going to put in any fresh capital. He was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a banking conclave organised by the eastern regional council of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

 IDBI, the National Thermal Power Corporation and GAIL have each contributed Rs 500 crore towards the revival of the Dabhol project, which suffered because of the collapse of its erstwhile promoter, Enron.

 IDBI is yet to decide on fresh loans for the expansion of Haldia Petrochemicals. We are considering the loan proposal, but Ill not be able to tell anything today, Agarwal said.

 He said IDBI has applied for opening representative offices and branches in Moscow, Singapore and Bahrain. The bank is also looking for a foreign partner to enter the asset management business.

 Addressing the conclave, Andhra Bank chairman and managing director K. Ramakrishnan said the bank would raise Rs 400 crore by the end of this calendar year from the debt market. 

 The bank plans to increase its total business to Rs 1,00,000 crore by 2009 from Rs 70,000 crore. Andhra Bank, in a joint venture with Punjab National Bank and Bank of Baroda, will set up a bank in Malaysia.

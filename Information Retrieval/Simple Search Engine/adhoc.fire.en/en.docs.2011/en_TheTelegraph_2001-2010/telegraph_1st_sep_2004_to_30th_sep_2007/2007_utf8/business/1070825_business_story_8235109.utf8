 BSNLs additional revenue plea rejected

 New Delhi, Aug. 24 (PTI): In a setback to state-owned BSNL, telecom tribunal TDSAT today rejected its plea for additional revenue from incoming national and international roaming calls of subscribers of private operators.

 We are unable to persuade ourself to approve the manner in which the appellant (BSNL) has tried to introduce revenue sharing in the mutually arrived interconnect agreement, the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) said.

 The telecom giant had demanded a 50:50 share on national and international roaming calls as these were routed through BSNLs network and terminated on other companies networks. It had entered into interconnect agreements with other operators and was charging from them.

 However, Trai, after receiving complaints, on September 11, 2006, fixed revenue sharing among operators at 30 paise per minute. This prompted BSNL to approach the tribunal.

 The Cellular Operators Association of India had also filed a different petition in the same matter seeking refund of the extra amount charged by BSNL after Trais decision. They had alleged that BSNL forced them to enter into such interconnect agreements.

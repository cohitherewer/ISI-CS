 Ispat profit at Rs 17.5 cr

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 20: Integrated steel maker Ispat Industries Ltd has posted a net profit of Rs 17.52 crore for the quarter ended December 31 compared with a net loss of Rs 217.03 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal.

 During this period, the P.K. and V.K. Mittal-owned company saw total income (net of excise) increase to Rs 1,865.26 crore from Rs 1,276.65 crore a year ago.

 The companys earnings before interest, depreciation and tax (EBIDT) at Rs 380.99 crore for the quarter was higher by 307 per cent compared with Rs 93.50 crore for the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. 

 Ispats hot rolled coil (HRC) production in October-December 2006 was 7.03 lakh tonnes, an increase of over 20 per cent over the same period of the previous year.

 HRC production for the nine months ended December 2006 was 19.72 lakh tonnes. 

 The improved performance was mainly on account of higher production and sales because of higher capacity utilisation and shift towards value added product mix.

 Ispat completed its on-going project of installing the fourth shell of the electric arc furnace.

 The company is looking to expand its saleable steel-making capacity at its integrated steel complex at Dolvi to 5 million tonnes per annum and install a coke oven plant and a pellet plant to further bring down the cost of production.

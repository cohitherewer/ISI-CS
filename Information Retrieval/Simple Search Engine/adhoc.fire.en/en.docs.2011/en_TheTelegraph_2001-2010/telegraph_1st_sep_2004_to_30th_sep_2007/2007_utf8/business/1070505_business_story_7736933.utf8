 Mystery suitor stalks Reuters

 London, May 4 (Reuters): News and financial data provider Reuters has received a takeover approach, sending its shares up almost a third, with Canadian publisher Thomson widely touted as the mystery suitor.

 Canadas Globe and Mail newspaper reported on its website that Thomson was in talks to buy London-based Reuters, citing sources close to both companies.

 Reuters declined to name its suitor, while Thomson had no comment. But Reuters second-largest shareholder, ValueAct, said depending on the offer, it would support a sale and a merger with Thomson would be a fabulous combination.

 Reuters shares leapt as much as 32 per cent to a five-year high of 649-3/4 pence, valuing the company at about 8.2 billion ($16.3 billion), on hopes a bid would spark an auction for the worlds biggest international news agency.

 Media shares have surged since Tuesday when Rupert Murdochs News Corp made a $5-billion bid for Wall Street Journal owner Dow Jones amp; Co Inc, which was rebuffed by Dow Jones controlling shareholders. That $60-a-share-bid was a 65 per cent premium to Dow Jones closing price on Monday.

 Thomson has been building up its financial news business and is in the process of selling its education division, which analysts think could raise $5 billion. 

 The Toronto-based firm lies third in a financial information market dominated by Reuters and privately-owned Bloomberg, and buying Reuters would give it a clear market lead, while also offering considerable cost savings, according to analysts.

 Thomson and Reuters would be a good fit, Numis Securities analysts wrote in a research note. 

 Other analysts said a trade buyer could pay up to 750 pence a share for Reuters.

 Traders said there were hopes a bid from Thomson could spark an auction, with News Corp, Web search group Google, software giant Microsoft and private equity groups, possibly working with management, tipped as possible bidders.

 Bloomberg said it was not looking to buy Reuters.

 Reuters will add to Thomson Financials position in institutional fixed income and sales and trading, Merrill Lynch analysts wrote in a research note. 

 There could be a large amount of cost savings potential, but the integration process will likely be challenging and complicated.

 New role for Ganguly at Exide

 Ganguly: The mentor

 Calcutta, April 20: S.B. Ganguly, executive chairman and chief executive officer of Exide Industries, has stepped down after 13 years on the job and has assumed the role of chairman emeritus.

 Rajesh Kapadia will be the non-executive chairman, T.V. Ramanathan the new chief executive officer and managing director and A.K.Mukherjee will be the director - finance.

 During Gangulys tenure, Exide grew almost 10 times from a Rs 238-crore company to one with a Rs 2382.68 crore turnover.

 Ganguly became chairman and managing director in 1993 after the Rahejas took over and was appointed executive chairman and chief executive officer in 2000.

 For the year ended March 31, the company recorded a net profit of Rs 155.21 crore as against Rs 100.73 crore for the same period last year. Total income increased to Rs 1,879.70 crore from Rs 1,385.79 crore. Gross turnover rose 35 per cent to Rs 2,382.68 crore from Rs 1,761.08 crore for the same period.

 A significant number of new cars, including the Zen Estillo, Swift Diesel, Hyundai Verna and the Logan from the Mahindra Renault stable, run on Exide batteries. 

 The company has an exclusive arrangement with Tata Motors and Toyota for all their cars. Tata Motors has also approved Exides battery design for its Rs-1-lakh car.

 The rise in profitability despite high cost of inputs such as lead, which accounts for almost 70 per cent of the costs, has been fuelled by the general economic boom and a steady rise in automobile population. The tight leash on costs also helped our profits grow, Ganguly said.

 The company also announced a dividend of 35 per cent.

 Lead prices have been on a high despite a growth in supplies, but a softer dollar in the past few months saw to it that this rise was negated to a certain extent, Ganguly added.

 The production of automotive batteries for four-wheelers increased from 4.6 million units to 5.6 million units. The production of batteries for two-wheeler rose from 5.8 million units to 7.0 million units. 

 The production of batteries for industrial applications rose from 800 million amp hours to over 1 billion amp hours.

 Exide continued to dominate the car battery market with an 80 per cent share. The company has a 78 per cent share in the general battery market.

 Demand for batteries for industrial application grew significantly during the year. Indian Railways placed a significant share of their business with Exide.

 The Japanese patent office has also granted a patent to Exide for lead retardant automotive batteries.

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: The finance ministry is toying with the idea of switching to the American system of including services in the countrys wholesale price-based inflation index to get a clearer picture of price changes in the economy.

 According to a draft paper prepared by the finance ministry, the inclusion of services in the index would give a true picture of inflation. The paper has been circulated to various departments concerned and industry associations for their comments. In India, the wholesale price index (WPI) does not include services.

 However, two major consumer price indices (for industrial workers and for urban non-manual employees) include services like medical care, education, recreation and amusement and transport and communications, according to the paper titled Strategy for Indias Services Sector: Broad Contours.

 But, major services like trade, hotels, transport and communications, financing, insurance, real estate and business services do not find the place in either WPI or consumer price indices.

 The draft paper cites the US example where services contribute around 73 per cent to GDP and the consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) gives a 59.9 per cent weightage to services.

 The services sector in India accounted for 54 per cent of GDP in 2005-06. However, if construction is listed as a service, which the RBI does, this share would go up to 60.7 per cent, the paper says. 

 Primary articles have a weight of 22.02 per cent in WPI, fuel, power, light and lubricants 14.23 per cent and manufactured products carry the highest weight of 63.75 per cent. Primary articles category includes food items, non-food items and mineral groups.

 Analysts said WPI inflation, which has reached close to the upper threshold of RBIs projection of 5-5.5 per cent for this fiscal, might show some moderation as services prices have a tendency to decline over a period.

 Merger tonic for Ranbaxy growth

 KAKOLY CHATTERJEE

New Delhi, March 28: Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited plans to increase its turnover to Rs 22,000 crore from Rs 6,069.8 crore within the next five years. The company expects to achieve this through organic growth and a spate of mergers and acquisitions (M amp;A).

 The reasons behind an M amp;A could be to foray into a new market, increase our production capacity and enter a new therapeutic drugs segment, Ranbaxy Laboratories CEO amp; MD Malvinder Singh told The Telegraph.

 According to Singh, for an M amp;A to be contemplated or successful, it (the M amp;A) has to be strategically and economically viable, adding to the gross profit and sales of the company.

 For instance, Ranbaxys foray into China has helped it source raw materials from there and thus remain competitive in other markets, including India. The move helped it improve back-end functions, according to analysts.

 Singh, however, declined to name future M amp;A targets as these are market-sensitive information. 

 The Ranbaxy growth story started in the early 1960s. It has an impressive record of growing at a scorching pace. The drug maker saw a growth of 167 per cent at $1,859 million during the fourth quarter of 2006. Its global sales also saw a growth of 22 per cent. 

 However, Singh pointed out that growth in the US and western European markets will be a different story in five years as their economies are reaching a plateau.

 For growth, one has to look at emerging markets like east Europe, southeast Asia and Africa, he said. 

 According to Singh, Ranbaxy will also ramp up presence in Africa. The company has invested $100 million in 45 African countries. Ranbaxy started business there in 1978.

 Plans for the domestic market include stronger product flow, re-orientation, focus on customers and higher productivity levels, Singh said. 

 On the stronger product flow, Singh said, Last year, eight products were launched. The manufacturing set-ups, distribution channels and front-end operations are in place and this will help bring down the cost of distribution and scale up the size. It will help in exponential growth leading to higher revenue flow.

 L amp;T ready to join SEZ race

 Naik: Building blocks

 Mumbai, Aug. 24: Larsen amp; Toubro Ltd (L amp;T) is jumping on to the bandwagon of companies seeking to establish special economic zones (SEZs).

 The engineering and construction company is planning to set up two SEZs: the first will focus on engineering services while the other will come up near the massive ship building facility it wants to set up.

 L amp;T chairman A.M. Naik told reporters on the sidelines of the companys annual general meeting here today that the first SEZ was likely to come up in Vadodara. The company has narrowed down its choices for the shipbuilding facility to two locations in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.

 L amp;T already builds ships at its Hazira works. It is now looking for a suitable site to set up another facility for shipbuilding and repair.

 An investment of over Rs 1,500 crore has been envisaged in the first phase itself. Naik said the proposed unit would make large ocean-going vessels such as LNG carriers. 

 India does not have facilities to produce such large carriers now. The global ship building industry is going through one of its most bullish phases with all shipyards running to full capacity.

 The company plans to raise $700 million through a flotation of global depository receipts (GDRs) to fund its expansion plans. The GDRs will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Shareholders cleared the proposal for the GDR issue today. 

 Reports said L amp;T also aims to raise a yen-denominated loan worth about $200 million from a clutch of foreign banks.

 Earlier, Naik told shareholders that the company was well positioned to exploit the opportunities in hydrocarbon, infrastructure, power, minerals, metals and other industrial sectors. He also said L amp;T was expanding its plant capacities in India and abroad. Substantial capacity augmentation at Hazira will help it address the growing demand in the oil and gas industry. The electrical and electronics division is also expanding capacity at Mysore, Ahmednagar and Mahape.

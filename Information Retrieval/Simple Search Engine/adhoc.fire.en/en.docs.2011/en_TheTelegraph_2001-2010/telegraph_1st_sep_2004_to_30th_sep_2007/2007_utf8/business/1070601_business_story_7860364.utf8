 Calcutta, May 31: Reliance Money is considering offering its customers a buyback facility for its gold coins. The Anil Ambani-controlled firm is retailing gold coins from this month through a distribution tieup with Valcambi of Switzerland.

 We will offer the buyback option before Dhanteras and Diwali this year, said Sudip Bandyopadhyay, chief executive officer of Reliance Money, while announcing the companys tieup with Barista Coffee to set up web-enabled retail kiosks at 100 Barista outlets across the country.

 Besides buying and selling shares, insurance products, mutual funds and other financial products through these kiosks, Reliance Money customers will also be able to send requisitions and orders for gold coins. The company sells gold coins in denominations of 5gm and 8gm through its 2,500 outlets as well as through those of Reliance World the retail outlet of Reliance Communications Ltd.

 Gold coins are not only a hedge against inflation but are also better than jewellery as an investment product. Coins are easy to exchange and store while for jewellery, there is no surety on purity. Jewellery also entails additional costs such as making charge, Bandyopadhyay said. 

 Reliance Money sells 24-carat gold coins with 999.9 purity. These coins are made and designed by Valcambi and they carry a purity certificate from the Swiss company, said Bandyopadhyay. 

 At present, 19 banks in the country sell gold coins, besides companies such as Tanishq, MMTC and State Trading Corporation. But none of them offers customers a buyback option.

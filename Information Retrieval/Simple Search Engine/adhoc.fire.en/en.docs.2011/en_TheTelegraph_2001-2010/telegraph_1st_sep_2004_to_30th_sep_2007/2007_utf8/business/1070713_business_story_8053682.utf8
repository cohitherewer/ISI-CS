 Sensex regains composure

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 12: Down in the dumps one day, up in the clouds the next.

 The sensex continues to skewer logic and defy forecasts. On Thursday, the bellwether index staggered to its feet after yesterdays clobbering and broke into a sure-footed run before pitching the flag at a new peak: 15092.04. 

 After the 99-point fall on Wednesday, it recorded a gain of 181.42 points.

 What does the market make of this shuffle: one step back, almost two steps forward? 

 The pundits say after the disappointment over Infosys results, the investors have quickly regained their composure. The market which continues to pick its cues from the world markets which have been buoyant this week reckons that even if the technology titans and the motown mob wobble in the first quarter, other sectors such as telecom and capital goods will roll out spectacular numbers.

 The mood seemed to permeate the market and soon all the sectoral indices were surging even the BSE IT index which had been badly mauled the previous day. Metal and realty stocks propelled the bull run. 

 It was a collective effort that saw the key index remaining strong throughout the day, summed up a broker. 

 Many reckon that the fundamentals of the market are sound: the economy continues to boom, interest rates are beginning to plateau and inflation is on leash. Many reckon that the big wheels in the automobile industry will blaze down the straight in the second quarter after the prolonged pit stop.

 Dhiraj Sachdev, vice-president (portfolio management services) at HSBC Asset Management, said the rally was sustained by strong global cues and the good liquidity in the market.

 Small and mid-cap stocks are contributing to this rally, which indicates the retail participation in the market, he said.

 After opening at 14963.53, the key BSE index touched the days high of 15112.22 before ending the day 1.22 per cent up at 15092.04 from yesterdays close of 14910.62.

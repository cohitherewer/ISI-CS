 Accenture to scale up India operations

 Panaji, Sept. 17 (PTI): Consulting and outsourcing company Accenture plans to scale up its operations in India by bringing the entire suite of products and services, besides increasing headcount to meet the growing demand from clients.

 We will bring the full footprint of Accenture into India and unleash all services in the country gradually, Accenture India domestic businesses managing director Sadeesh Raghavan said.

 With 14 offices in Bangalore, Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune, Accenture, which has been operating in the country for over 20 years, will open more offices and scale up headcount to offer its services to companies across segments.

 The company has around 35,000 Indian employees. Raghavan said the company would strengthen its operations across all the verticals it is present in.

 We are not present equally in all the segments. There are segments such as products and resources where we have a good presence in the country. But there is still some ground to cover in other areas, and we will strengthen our activities in these areas gradually, he said. The company is also planning to expand in e-governance and financial services.

 Accenture specialises in communication, hi-tech, and financial services, among other areas. The company has been recording a double-digit growth rate in India. 

 Ruling out plans to list Accenture on Indian stock exchanges, Raghavan said the company does not want to dilute the brand by listing it on the bourses. We are already listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We have no plans to list the company on any Indian stock exchange as that would dilute the brand, he said.

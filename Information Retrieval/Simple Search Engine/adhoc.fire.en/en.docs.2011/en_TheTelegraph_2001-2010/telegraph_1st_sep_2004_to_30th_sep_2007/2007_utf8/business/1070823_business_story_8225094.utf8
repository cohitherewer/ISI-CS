 Mallya backs Scotch levy

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mallya: Points to ponder

 New Delhi, Aug. 22: Liquor baron Vijay Mallya is supporting tariffs by some state governments on imported liquor.

 We dont have to counter it (higher tariff), he said. He was implying that the country should not go overboard while complying with WTO rules.

 Foreign liquor companies have expressed concerns over state levies violating the spirit of WTO rules. They have criticised the Maharashtra government for slapping a 200 per cent duty on Scotch. 

 Mallya, who acquired Whyte amp; Mackay for $1.2 billion earlier this year, plans to launch other foreign brands such as Dalmore and Jura. It is going to be a pan-India, Diwali launch, he said.

 He said he expected a surge in demand for whiskies in India and China that would enable UB to get a hefty return on the investment in Whyte amp; Mackay.

 Until today, the only missing link in our portfolio has been Scotch. Because of the shortage and rapidly increasing prices of Scotch whisky we needed a reliable supply source, he said.

 Mallya will also bring brands such as Poison white rum and vodka. His UB group enjoys a 70 per cent market share in vodka, with bestselling brands such as Romanov and White Mischief in its stable. The total size of the vodka market in India is three million cases. 

 On the possibility of the emergence of a grey market for Scotch because of the state levies, Mallya said, Our concern should not be the grey market but compliance with WTO rules.

 The import duty on liquor was reduced after the US and the EU moved the WTO against Indias high tariffs. However, some states increased local levies. 

 There are apprehensions among liquor players that a grey market for Scotch may emerge because of the levies.

 Some liquor companies, however, refused to buy Mallyas views. Amrit Kiran Singh, area director of Brown amp; Forman, said, The heavy duty on Scotch will have a negative impact on revenue collection. It will encourage the grey market in India as the price of Scotch will be exorbitant. 

 He said consumers would buy whisky from the grey market because it would be available at half the price.

 Not only will this dent profits of liquor companies, it will also impact revenues of governments, Singh said.

 Sale of popular Scotch brands such as Johny Walker, Jack Daniels and Chivas Regal plummeted in Mumbai, with prices shooting up to more than Rs 3,000 a bottle.

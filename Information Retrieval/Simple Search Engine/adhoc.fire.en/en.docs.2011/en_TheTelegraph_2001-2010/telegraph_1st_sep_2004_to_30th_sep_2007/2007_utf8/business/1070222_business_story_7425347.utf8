The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Godrej eyes a big share of realty pie

 Godrej: A room of his own

 Mumbai, Feb. 21: Realty is the straight road to success.

 The Rs 6,000-crore Godrej group which focuses on fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and consumer products like soaps is placing its bet on real estate development. 

 The group plans to develop more than 20 million sq ft of realty space across the country. Over the next five years, revenues from property development will overtake that generated from its core business activities.

 The conglomerates realty plans are now being spearheaded by Godrej Properties Ltd (GPL). GPL had so far been confined largely to Maharashtra, where it developed several properties over the past 15 years. However, the company is now spreading its wings. It is currently developing properties in Goa, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Calcutta, apart from suburbs close to Mumbai such as Thane and Kalyan.

 In an interview with The Telegraph, Adi B. Godrej, chairman of the Godrej Group, divulged that while the company was developing more than 20 million sq ft, sales and profits of GPL were set to double over the next four years.

 By the end of this fiscal, the company expects to rope in private equity in two of its special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that are implementing projects in Hyderabad and Calcutta respectively.

 The plan is to take GPL public next fiscal. We hope to raise few hundred crores of rupees from private equity and several hundred crores of rupees from the public issue. In the public issue, we plan to issue fresh capital to the tune of 10 per cent, Godrej revealed.

 Godrej said the public issue is necessary, considering the ambitious plans that GPL has in its agenda. These include a combination of residential, commercial and shopping malls. 

 Though the company is now in the process of developing over 20 million sq ft, the number is expected to rise in the coming months. This is because there are many properties of the Godrej group across the country that could be used for development rather than manufacturing in the future. 

 For instance, in Bangalore, a group company is into poultry breeding. A large part of the land here could be used for realty. In certain cases, there is an opportunity cost in manufacturing. Here, manufacturing will be better if it is located in states where tax benefits are lucrative, Godrej added. 

 GPL has completed several projects in Mumbai and Pune and some of the projects being developed include the nine-acre Planet Godrej in central Mumbai and the 20-acre Godrej Woodsman Estate in Bangalore. 

 Explaining the reasons for the group putting so much money into realty, Godrej said the property development market in India is worth Rs 300,000 crore ($65 billion) and it is growing at the rate of 20 per cent annually. 

 It is the biggest single business and the investments are huge comprising several thousand crores of rupeesIn three to five years, our groups property development business could become the single largest and it could overtake consumer durables and products, Godrej said.

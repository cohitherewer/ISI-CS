 Open door for Christian Dior

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 31: The government has given the go-ahead to French fashion house Christian Dior Couture to infuse foreign equity up to 51 per cent in a single-brand retail trade company in India.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram today approved the designer houses proposal to bring $270,000 (Rs 1.1 crore) as equity. He also cleared 22 other foreign direct investment (FDI) proposals following the recommendations of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board.

 This will result in foreign equity inflow of around $100 million in agriculture, food processing, energy and broadcasting.

 The government has also cleared UBS Indias plans to acquire shares of the existing non-banking finance companies at an estimated investment of Rs 224 crore.

 A proposal from the Bombay Stock Exchange to induct foreign equity from four overseas investors and another from AL Khaleej Sugar of Dubai to set up a trading subsidiary for the re-export of imported raw sugar have also been approved.

 The government also permitted BT Telecom India to change the status of its operating company to operating-cum-holding company. This will enable BT to make downstream investments of up to Rs 142.60 crore.

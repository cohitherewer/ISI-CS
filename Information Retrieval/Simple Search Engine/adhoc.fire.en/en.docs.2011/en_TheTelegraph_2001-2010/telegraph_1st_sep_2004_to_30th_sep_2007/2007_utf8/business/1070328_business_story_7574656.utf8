 Move to clear air on Hutch FDI

 New Delhi, March 27 (PTI): Amid allegations of breach of FDI norms in Hutch Essar, minority stakeholders Asim Ghosh and Analjit Singh along with Vodafone and HTIL, would be making brief presentations to the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) on March 29.

 Ghosh and Singh jointly hold about 12.26 per cent stake, which is in the centre of a controversy on whether it actually belongs to them or HTIL (or now Vodafone).

 The two shareholders, along with Vodafone and HTIL, have been asked by FIPB to clarify their positions on March 29, sources said, adding that all the four parties have been given 5-10 minutes each to make their case.

 HTIL would be represented by legal firm Amarchand Mangal Das and Vodafone would be represented by its senior official looking after mergers and acquisitions.

 Official sources said the FIPB has also sought the home ministrys opinion on the matter. The controversy relates to an allegation that Vodafone, which acquired a 52 per cent controlling stake in Hutch Essar from HTIL, also owns the 12.6 per cent stake held by Ghosh and Singh, but the two have denied the charge.

 Since Essar owns 22 per cent FDI in its 33 per cent stake in the joint venture, the total FDI would cross the 74 per cent limit and this is being examined by the FIPB.

 Ghosh and Singh have already written to the FIPB assuring that they are the actual owners of their respective stakes.

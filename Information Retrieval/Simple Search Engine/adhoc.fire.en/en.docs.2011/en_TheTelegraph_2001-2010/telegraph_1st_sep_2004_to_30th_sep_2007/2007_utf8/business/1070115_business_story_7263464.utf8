 Markets upbeat on Q3 report card

 Great expectations have been built up around the third-quarter corporate results. That is why the market has bounced back so quickly in the last couple of days. Most analysts expect the sensex companies to show a rise of between 27 per cent and 31 per cent year-on-year. If the earnings of the oil companies are excluded, earnings growth is expected to be even higher (see table). One reason for this is the low rate of growth notched up during the third quarter of FY06 the low base helps to show a higher growth rate now.

 The cement, metals and telecom sectors are likely to show the highest year-on-year rate of increase in earnings. But hotels, media, pharmaceuticals and IT too are expected to do well. As a matter of fact, the improvement should be across the board, although Citigroup says sectors such as auto, bank, power and consumer will lag the high average market growth during the quarter.

 CLSA is predicting a 31 per cent year-on-year growth in sensex earnings and says that, adjusted for exceptionals and one-time items, profit growth should be even higher, at 34.7 per cent to be precise. The main reason for the growth, of course, lies in the excellent state of the economy, which means that topline growth for companies should be very robust. Citigroup says with the exception of power utilities, no other sector is likely to post a topline growth of less than 15 per cent. At the same time, higher interest rates are unlikely to have much of an impact on earnings in the December quarter. Margins too are expected to increase, primarily because while prices have either remained the same or increased, some metal prices have dropped. CLSA points out, however, that the margin boost will come from only a few sectors.

 The results so far have been good, which is why the market has rebounded so fast. Infosys, the bellwether of the IT sector, has shown decent results and upped its guidance, albeit marginally, in spite of the appreciation in the value of the rupee. The Infosys results also show that IT companies are finally seeing better pricing.

 The trouble is that unlike the positive surprise after the better-than-expected second-quarter results, this time expectations are so high that even if companies show excellent results, there may not be much upside. As Morgan Stanley puts it, Earnings revisions saw a significant uptrend post above-expectation 2Q results. Although 3Q growth is likely to exceed 2Q, expectations are already high and a similar round of upgrades is highly unlikely this time around. Nevertheless, the market has already started betting on tax cuts in the budget, thanks to the governments buoyant revenue position.

 Analysts insist, however, that earnings growth is likely to slow down in FY08, with slower global growth playing a part. The RBIs determination to cool the economy is another factor. In short, good third-quarter results may be the right opportunity to book profits.

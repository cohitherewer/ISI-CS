The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 End to IOC refinery land spat in sight 

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 SLICK MOVE

 New Delhi, March 14: The shipping ministry has assured the petroleum ministry that it will quickly hand over to the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) the additional 81 acres required by the company for its refinery in Haldia. 

 The transfer of land to IOC by the shipping ministry was delayed because the fertiliser ministry dragged its feet on the grounds that Hindustan Fertiliser Corporation (HFCL) may need the plot for its revival plans. Shipping secretary A.K. Mahapatra told The Telegraph that the issue would be settled in two months, keeping the interest of both the companies in mind. 

 Sources said 24 acres of the 81 acres for IOC was with the Calcutta Port Trust, while another 57 acres adjacent to the refinery would be transferred from Hindustan Fertiliser. 

 Hindustan Fertiliser was initially allotted 531 acres but returned 275 acres to the Calcutta Port Trust as it did not require so much land.

 The petroleum ministry has told the shipping ministry that IOC was willing to pick up the tab on the unpaid lease of Hindustan Fertiliser Corporation (HFCL) on the 81 acres. 

 The unpaid lease of Rs 5 crore is a bone of contention as the Calcutta Port Trust wanted all the dues to be cleared. 

 A senior petroleum ministry official told The Telegraph that the petroleum ministry would go by the decision of the shipping ministry on the dues. It is not in national interest to hold up the deal over the unpaid dues and if the shipping ministry wants IOC to pay the arrears, the oil company will do the needful, he said. 

 The existing lease between the Calcutta Port Trust and Hindustan Fertiliser, a sick company, will have to be terminated before the new lease.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Local allies keep mum

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 4: The Blackstone buyout of Hilton Hotels Corporation will have its impact on India though the hotel giants local partners are loathe to discuss the development.

 Hilton has tieups with two companies EIH, which runs the Oberoi and Trident group of Hotels, and real estate developer DLF Ltd.

 EIH has a franchising agreement with Hilton for its Trident brand of properties.

 Under the terms of the deal, Oberoi Towers, the five-star hotel from EIHs stable in South Mumbai, was re-named as Hilton Towers, while nine of its properties were co-branded under the Trident Hilton brand. EIH is under an obligation to pay Hilton a percentage of room sales for 15 years as a franchisee fee. 

 Though Hilton did not participate in the equity of EIH, it was responsible for international marketing, promotion and reservations through its network.

 Last November, Hilton Hotels formed a joint venture company here with DLF to develop and own 75 hotels and service apartments over the next seven years. 

 The joint venture will first see 20 hotels coming up in various parts of the country, including Calcutta, Chandigarh and Chennai. A large number of these hotels are expected to be Hilton Garden Inns, a business hotel brand. 

 In Calcutta, the DLF-Hilton combine plans to develop two hotels and a service apartment on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. 

 The joint venture plans to invest Rs 600 crore in a 250-room luxury hotel under the Hilton brand, a 320-room business hotel under Hilton Garden Inns and service apartments under the Homewood Suite tag.

 DLF will hold a 74 per cent stake in the joint venture company with Hilton holding a minority stake. Over the next five years, Hilton plans to invest $143 million in the joint venture company.

 The fallout of the Blackstone acquisition for Indian operations could not be ascertained as the spokesperson for Hilton Hotels based in Singapore was unavailable for comment.

 EIH officials clarified that the Oberoi Groups alliance with Hilton Hotels pertained only to the sales and marketing of Trident Hilton Hotels worldwide. A spokesperson from DLF refused to comment on the acquisition. We are not aware of this development as we have not received any intimation to this effect, the official said.

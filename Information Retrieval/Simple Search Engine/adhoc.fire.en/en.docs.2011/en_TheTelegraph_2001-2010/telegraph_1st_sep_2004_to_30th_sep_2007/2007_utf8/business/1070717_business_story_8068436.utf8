 Leyland JV with German firm

 Chennai, July 16 (PTI): Hinduja group flagship Ashok Leyland and Germany-based automotive supplier Siemens VDO Automotive AG today formed a joint venture to design and develop infotronics products and services for the transportation sector. 

 Infotronics is the use of electronics in automobiles to increase passenger safety and fuel efficiency.

 The 50:50 venture will develop electronic components and software such as instrument cluster applications, cockpit electronics and control units for both commercial vehicles and passenger cars, Ashok Leyland managing director R. Seshasayee said here.

 While the new company is expected to meet the requirements of Ashok Leyland, it will also pursue opportunities in India and abroad. 

 The duo will accelerate the development of next generation telematics solutions for introduction in the market, he said. The venture, expected to register a 100-million-euro turnover in five to six years, will start operations from early 2008. It will initially have a workforce of 100, Seshasayee said.

 Noting that auto electronics was the fastest growing segment in the auto industry with a growth rate of 6-7 per cent, Siemens VDOs global commercial vehicles business CEO Christopher Maximilian Eisenhardt said the venture would cater to safety and comfort requirements in cars and commercial vehicles. 

 Seshasayee said Ashok Leyland and Siemens VDO had been working together as consortium members in the Chennai metropolitan bus terminus project to provide telematics solutions.

 He said the project was expected to be launched later this year on a pilot basis at a bus terminus here.

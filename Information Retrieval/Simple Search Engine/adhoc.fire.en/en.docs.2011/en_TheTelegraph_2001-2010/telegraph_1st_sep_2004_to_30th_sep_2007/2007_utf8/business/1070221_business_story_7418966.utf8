 Publicis recasts media operations

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 20: Publicis Groupe Media has launched a consolidated media negotiation unit called India Media Exchange (IMX). This is in keeping with the trend of communications companies aligning their media buying operations.

 IMX will manage the combined buying functions of Starcom MediaVest Group and ZenithOptimedia, the two key assets of the Publicis Groupe in India. The group plans to leverage on their strengths not only to create scale but also to give competitive advantage to their clients.

 The Mumbai-based IMX will also be present in Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai.

 The combine will create the second largest media buying entity with an estimated billing of around Rs 1,500 crore. The largest entity has a billing in excess of Rs 3,000 crore. Such pooling, industry analysts said, gives the media agencies a better position in a competitive market, enabling them to buy more media space at lower rates.

 Jack Klues, chairman of Publicis Groupe Media, said, At a time when media agencies are not merely buying space and time we realised that opportunities for collaboration are immense and is really unexploited. Today is all about specific solutions for specific contexts that take into account the needs of a client and brand, the mindsets and habits of consumers.

 He added that IMX would customise the services and solutions for its clients that are specific to their interests and it will not adopt a one-size-fits-all approach.

 Rolta to set up software unit in city

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

Calcutta, Feb. 11: Rolta India Ltd, the geospatial and engineering design firm, will set up a software development and knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) unit in the city, which will employ around 1,000. The company plans to hire around 5,000 people by 2008.

 Rolta has asked us for a one to two acre land and they plan to set up a state-of-the-art software knowledge process outsourcing unit. They are globally famous for their geospatial and engineering designs. They will develop software in the city for the domestic and international markets. In the first phase, the company will employ 1,000 people, but the number could go up to 2,000, said Bengal IT minister Debesh Das.

 The company has executed over 350 e-security projects in 18 countries.

 The IT minister was recently in Mumbai, where the talks were finalised and Rolta mooted the proposal. There were also discussions with smaller IT companies that would visit Bengal to check out the facilities on offer.

 Das, however, said since the project involved high-end software development, it was difficult to furnish investment details at this stage. Since the land requirement is minimal, it should pose no problem at all, he added.

 The company has connectivity and software development centres in India and the US and seven subsidiaries in the US, Canada, the UK, Germany, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and UAE. 

 It is globally prominent in designing geospatial information systems (GISs) and also operates through two other key divisions engineering design automation (EDA) and e-solutions. It has a joint venture with US-based nuclear energy technology firm Stone amp; Webster for EDA projects in power, oil, gas and petroleum sectors. The project is called Stone amp; Webster Rolta Ltd.

 Rolta raised $103.50 million through the issue of 18,482143 global depository receipts (GDRs), including a $13.5-million greenshoe option on the London Stock Exchange in April 2006. The proceeds will partially be used in its overseas expansion, especially in the Asia Pacific.

 It has Rs 550 crore of confirmed orders and orders worth Rs 1,000 crore are under negotiation.

 The companys consolidated revenue for the fiscal ended June 30, 2006 was Rs 543.39 crore, up 27.6 per cent year-on-year. Consolidated net worth increased to Rs 941.43 crore from Rs 456.63 crore.

 This the second in the recent series of very high-end IT projects to be set up in the city that require very small quantity of land. It is indeed good news for the land-strapped IT department.

 The other project is the common facility centre for chip design India Design Centre, which will be set up on 1.7 acres, the first of its kind in India. Talks are on with chip biggies like Texas Instruments, Cadence, Qualcomm and Intel about the project.

 Satyam profit surges

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, April 20: Satyam Computer Services has posted a 37.11 per cent increase in profit after tax (PAT) at Rs 397.50 crore for the quarter ended March 31 from Rs 289.90 crore in the same quarter last year.

 The total income of the company increased 38.12 per cent to Rs 1,778.40 crore from Rs 1,287.52 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago.

 For the year ended March 31, Satyam recorded a PAT of Rs 1,423.23 crore compared with Rs 1,239.75 crore in the previous year and total income rose to Rs 6,410.08 crore from Rs 5,012.22 crore.

 The group posted a PAT of Rs 393.58 crore for the quarter ended March 31 compared with Rs 284.65 crore in the year-ago period. The total income increased to Rs 1,849.55 crore from Rs 1,342.51 crore for the corresponding quarter in 2006.

 The board of directors has declared a final dividend of 125 per cent for 2006-07.

 Most of the gap in the growth of revenue and net profit is due to appreciation of rupee by 6 per cent (vis-a-vis the dollar), Ram Mynampati, president and member of Satyams board, said.

 As the rupee continues to appreciate, Satyam has forecast revenue to grow by 20-22 per cent in this fiscal and earning per share to increase by 18-20 per cent. He said the company was taking enough forward cover to hedge against the volatility of the dollar.

 The company added 35 clients during the fourth quarter, taking the total clients to 560, including 165 Fortune 500 companies. In January-March, the company added 1,265 employees to take the total to 39,552.

 Though the exchange rate worries persist, Satyam has not felt any impact of creeping US slowdown and none of its customers has scaled down its engagement with the company.

 The company also expects the billing rates to go up by 2-3 per cent across the board because of the demand-supply situation.

 and greater value that customers see in deals with Indian IT companies, especially after successful execution of projects, Mynampati said.

 Our revenues from the US markets have come down below 60 per cent. We garnered 20 per cent from Europe and 7 per cent from Australia, chairman and managing director B. Ramalinga Raju said.

 The company plans to invest $100 million and recruit 15,000 more by the end of FY 2008, Raju said.

 Almost 45 per cent of the recruits will come in at the entry level from campuses in Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam, Nagpur and Chennai, Raju said.

 The company has an annual attrition rate of 15.6 per cent while in the last quarter of FY07, it fell to 13 per cent.

 We are coordinating with Nasscom to provide special courses to the campus recruits so that they could be easily absorbed into service, he said.

 Raju said the BPO subsidiary Nipuna had achieved a 91 per cent growth and poised to achieve a 60 per cent in 2007-08.

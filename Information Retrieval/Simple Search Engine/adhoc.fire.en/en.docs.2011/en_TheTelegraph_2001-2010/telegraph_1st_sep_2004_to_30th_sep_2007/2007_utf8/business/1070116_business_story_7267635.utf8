 IPCL gives credit to cost cut for high profit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 15: The Indian Petrochemicals Corporations (IPCL) third-quarter net profit grew 40 per cent to Rs 405 crore from Rs 289 crore in the corresponding period last year. 

 However, net turnover for the quarter grew a modest 9 per cent to touch Rs 3,056 crore (Rs 2,800 crore). IPCL said profits were high due to the ongoing cost reduction programme and it came despite weak prices of certain products during the period. 

 Net profit for the nine-month period increased by 20 per cent to Rs 1,014 crore compared with Rs 843 crore in the corresponding previous period and net turnover grew to Rs 9,122 crore (Rs 8,009 crore). 

 Chairman Mukesh Ambani said: I am pleased with IPCLs performance in the third quarter. Despite a challenging environment, improvement in performance was achieved primarily through better productivity and reduction in costs, thereby enhancing value for our shareholders.

 During the nine-month period, IPCL said global operating rates of ethylene crackers continued to be high due to a sustained demand and lack of new capacities. The third quarter witnessed a downward movement in polymer and mono ethylene glycol (MEG) prices due to a fall in crude oil prices, which recovered later in the quarter. However, polyester prices remained strong. 

 Production volume during the nine months decreased from 4.49 million tonnes to 4.29 million tonnes because of limited availability of gas feedstock on account of floods in Gujarat in August last year. The floods also affected ethylene production by over 6000 tonnes. It also resulted in an additional cost due to usage of imported propane to sustain regular production at Gandhar complex. 

 According to IPCL, production volumes of polymers (PP, PE and PVC), ethylene and propylene was 8,26,000 tonnes, 7,09,000 tonnes and 2,61,000 tonnes, respectively. Exports of manufactured products decreased by 15 per cent to Rs 1,075 crore compared with Rs 1,266 crore for the corresponding previous period. 

 HCL Tech

 HCL Technologies has posted a net profit of Rs 266 crore for the second quarter ended December 31, 2006 against Rs 277.7 crore in corresponding quarter last year. The companys total income during the quarter was Rs 1,023.4 crore against Rs 1,117.5 crore in the same period previous fiscal. However, the figures are not comparable because of the merger of nine companies into HCL Technologies.

 Riding high on the growth from its new business, the company reported a 39 per cent jump in its consolidated revenues at Rs 1,465 crore and 58 per cent increase in its net income at Rs 286 crore, HCL Technologies CEO and chairman Shiv Nadar said.

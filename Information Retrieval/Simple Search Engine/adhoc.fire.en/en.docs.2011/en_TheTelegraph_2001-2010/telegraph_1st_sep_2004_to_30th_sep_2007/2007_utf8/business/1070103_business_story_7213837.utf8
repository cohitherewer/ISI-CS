 Airline merger plan to be finalised soon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Taking wings

 New Delhi, Jan. 2: The group of ministers (GoM) headed by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee is likely to meet soon to finalise a plan on the merger of Indian Airlines (IA) and Air-India (A-I). 

 The government is considering several proposals, including forming a holding company, with domestic and international operations, air cargo, engineering and ground handling as separate strategic businesses. It is also considering enacting a law or getting a court order or simply issuing an ordinance to merge the two carriers.

 The fastest way to merge the two would be the ordinance route as was done in 1953 when the Air Corporation Act was repealed to create the two public sector airlines, sources said.

 However, a legislation could also be brought in during the budget session of Parliament after the Union cabinet gives its final nod to the proposal of the GoM, they said.

 The committee of secretaries, which was asked by the GoM to finalise various options and work out the nuances of the merger process, has already favoured the merger and offered several choices as to how to go about it.

 There are proposals to merge IA into A-I or vice versa. The civil aviation ministry has been pressing for a total merger plan, but many within the committee of secretaries set up to study the proposals have opposed this. 

 Many members considered the total merger of the two airlines as a messy business which could create managerial and organisational problems that could hamper realisation of economies of scale.

 A section of government officials dealing with the issue is in favour of reframing the original proposals of the management consultant into one where there will be one holding company and three to four strategic business units which would include Indian Airlines, Air-India, the merged entity of their engineering divisions and also another entity managing the low-cost operations of these two airlines. 

 The GoM will also take into account the protests voiced by powerful airline unions. They have raised questions on pay and seniority parity. A-I managers earn far more than IA. 

 The civil aviation ministry had set April 1 as the deadline for the merger, which sources said, could be overshot. This target date was set assuming that the Union cabinet would accord clearance to the proposal by the end of this month.

 When the contract for the global consultant for the merger was awarded to M/s Accenture-led consortium to draw a roadmap for the process, it was decided that the pre-cabinet work would be completed in 10 weeks and the approvals after the cabinet nod be obtained within the next 16 weeks.

 Meanwhile, the consultant has already started working on the integration of the staff of the two carriers as well as their subsidiaries, Air-India Express and Alliance Air.

 However, it is not yet clear as to whether the two subsidiaries would be merged to form a new low-cost airline or it would remain a subsidiary of the merged entity.

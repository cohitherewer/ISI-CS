 Reliance in JV talks with Nova Chemicals

 Ambani: Aiming high

 Mumbai, March 18 (PTI): Reliance Industries (RIL) is understood to be in an advanced stage of discussions with North American plastics and petrochemicals firm Nova Chemicals.

 RIL group chairman Mukesh Ambani is in the US to discuss a potential joint venture with Nova Chemicals, sources close to the development said.

 No official comments could be obtained from executives of RIL, which is also looking for a possible acquisition in the global retail space and is believed to be in talks with Carrefour, Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer.

 The planned alliance with Nova Chemicals, which has operations across the US, Canada and Europe with an annual turnover of over $6.5 billion, could include product swaps, infrastructure sharing as well as joint exploration of growth opportunities.

 RIL has made presentations to Nova and Dow Chemicals, sources said, indicating that Nova appeared to be on the radar of Indias biggest corporate house as of now and an alliance announcement could be made soon.

 If all goes well, the two companies could also consider equity partnership at a later stage of the joint venture, sources said.

 Nova officials were not available for comments.

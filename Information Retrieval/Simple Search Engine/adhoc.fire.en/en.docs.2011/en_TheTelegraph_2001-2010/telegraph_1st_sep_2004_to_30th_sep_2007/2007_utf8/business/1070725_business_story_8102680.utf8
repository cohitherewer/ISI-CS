 Satyam enjoys African safari

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, July 24: Satyam Computer Services plans to strengthen its ties with South Africa. As part of its initiative, Satyam will give training to 200 South African technical graduates by March next year.

 We have entered into a partnership with the South African government to train its technical graduates in language skills and computer-enabled activities for ICT needs, senior Satyam official Virender Aggarwal said. 

 We have tied up with Satyam as South Africa needs 60,000 ICT professionals by 2010, South African high commissioner Francis S. Moloi said.

 According to Moloi, the South African government is in talks with other software companies such as Infosys to train technical graduates. It is also in touch with the Tata group for expertise in financial management. According to Agrawal, Satyam has plans to develop its offices in Johannesburg and Cape Town into software development centres at a later stage. 

 With South Africa constituting more than 60 per cent of the information technology market of the African continent and a 20 per cent annual growth in IT spends, the country offers tremendous business opportunities, Aggarwal said.

 Cairn pipeline gets the go-ahead

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 THE RIGHT MIX

 Mumbai, Sept. 11: Cairn India today said it had got approval from the government for a pipeline to transport crude oil from its Mangala field in Rajasthan to refiners.

 Production from the field is expected to start from 2009.

 The Indian arm of Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy Plc said the right of use (RoU) approval from the government would enable the company and its joint venture partner, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), to access land to build the pipeline.

 The company will now prepare the Mangala field development plan that will be submitted to the ONGC and the government shortly.

 The RoU will help us to schedule our Mangala project so that it can start production by 2009, Cairn India chairman Bill Gammell said.

 Cairn India is committed to continuing investment in India and is very much focused on creating shareholder value by developing its world class resource base in Rajasthan, he added.

 According to company sources, Cairn and the ONGC will spend around $700-800 million on the pipeline. Cairn India, it is learnt, will invest about 70 per cent, or $550 million, of the sum. 

 The company, however, is still awaiting a crucial government approval on recovery of some of the development cost.

 The pipeline has become a part of the development plan and, in this case, we are allowed to recover some cost of development. We have still not heard from the government on the issue, Gammell said.

 Cairn India said the pipeline would transport the Rajasthan crude from Mangala to a coastal location in Gujarat.

 By the end of 2009, Cairn would produce 100,000 barrels of oil per day from the Rajasthan fields. 

 Production would reach a plateau of 1,50,000 barrels per day some time in 2010.

 Profit path 

 The proceeds from its initial public offering (IPO) in India helped Cairn Energy, the parent company, to earn a profit in the first half of the year. 

 Net income was $1.52 billion, or $10.66 a share compared with a loss of $5.8 million, or 3.68 cents, a year earlier, Cairn said in a statement today.

 Cairn rose the most in a month in London trading on September 7 when it announced the purchase of two smaller rivals with interests in Tunisia for a combined 36 million ($72.7 million).

 Cairn shares rose as much as 3.1 per cent today and traded up 2.9 per cent at 1,838 pence in London. 

 The stock is up 1.7 per cent this year, giving the company a market value of 2.4 billion ($4.9 billion).

 Last year, Cairn raised $1.98 billion from the IPO of its India arm, to part finance the development of the Rajasthan fields.

 Average net production in the six months was 22,486 barrels of oil equivalent a day, down 18 per cent from last year.

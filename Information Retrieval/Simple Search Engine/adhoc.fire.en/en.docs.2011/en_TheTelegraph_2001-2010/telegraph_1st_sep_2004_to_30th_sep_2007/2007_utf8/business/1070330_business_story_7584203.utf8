 Tatas in pact for Bengal pipe unit

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mukherjee: Upbeat

 Calcutta, March 29: The Singur experience has not deterred the Tata group from making more investments in Bengal.

 Tata Metaliks, a Tata Steel subsidiary that manufactures pig iron, has decided to invest Rs 150 crore in Kharagpur to set up a ductile iron (DI) pipe manufacturing unit.

 The unit would also bring Japanese major Kubota Corporation, a $10-billion company, to the state. 

 Kubota, one of the top DI pipe makers in the world, will hold a 44 per cent stake in the joint venture.

 The unit will have a 110,000-tonne capacity. The pipe is mainly used in transmission and distribution of drinking water by civic authorities.

 The plant would be up and running within the existing campus of Tata Metaliks spread over 190 acres by the last quarter of 2008-09. The unit will require 40 acres.

 The development gains significance as this company is awaiting land allotment from the Bengal government for a bigger project for almost two years.

 Tata Metaliks had sought 500 acres of contiguous land adjacent to its existing unit to set up a steel plant. The government has not yet been able to acquire the land.

 We were pursuing a number of projects, including a steel project and a DI pipe unit. The latter has almost fructified. Once the government hands over the land, we will start work on the steel project, said T. Mukherjee, chairman of Tata Metaliks. 

 Once completed, the new company likely to be named Tata Metaliks Kubota Pipe Co Ltd will have a turnover of $100 million or Rs 450 crore.

 The company could look at expanding this unit further. Apart from Kubota and Tata Metaliks, Japanese trading company Metal One will also pick up a 5 per cent stake in the company. Tatas will hold 51 per cent share. 

 The Rs 150-crore project will be executed in 1:1 debt equity ratio.

 The demand for DI pipes in India is about half a million tonne but it has witnessed 27 per cent annual growth over last 6-7 years.

 Apart from serving the domestic market, Metal One would help in export, especially to the Middle East where Kubota enjoys good market share.

 Mukherjee claimed that the cost of production would less here than what Kubota do in Japan.

 Tata Metaliks, which acquired a new unit in Goa last year, will end this fiscal with 450,000 tonne of production. Next year, this may touch 600,000 tonne.

 DVC firms up plans to invest Rs 24000cr

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 14: The Damodar Valley Corporation will invest Rs 24,000 crore in the next three to four years to add 6,300mw to its capacity by 2012.

 The plan is to set up seven units and raise the plant load factor (PLF) at its Durgapur, Chandrapura and Bokaro facilities to 85 per cent by 2009-10 from 80 per cent in 2007-08. PLF indicates the efficiency of a plant. It is measured by the ratio of current levels of generation to the maximum generation capacity expressed in percentage. DVC now produces 2,210mw at a PLF of 79 per cent. 

 In 2001-02, we had a PLF of 36 per cent. This has improved to 79 per cent this fiscal. We will invest Rs 1,000 crore in our existing plants to maintain the efficiency level at above 80 per cent, said DVC chairman A.K. Burman here today. 

 A higher PLF is a prerequisite if you want to reduce your generation cost and improve profitability, he added. DVC expects to reduce its cost to Rs 2.20 per unit from Rs 2.89. 

 DVC is banking on its captive coal blocks to cut fuel costs. It has the mining licence for the blocks at Barjora, Khagra-Joydevpur, Gondulpara and Sahapur-Jamarpani. These blocks have a reserve of 683 million tonnes. 

 This will take care of our coal requirement for 4,000mw, or 60 per cent of our new generation capacity, for 30 years, Burman said. 

 The coal from the captive blocks is cheaper by 20 per cent than Coal Indias offering. The coal mines are located close to the power stations and the company will save around 10-11 per cent on transportation costs. This reduction in fuel cost will cut the power generation expenses by 0.30 paisa per unit.

 Fed likely to keep interest rates steady

 Chicago, May 7 (Reuters): The US Federal Reserve looks certain to hold interest rates steady when it meets this week and is likely to restate worries on inflation, even while nodding to weak growth and an easing of price pressures.

 The central bank has held benchmark overnight borrowing costs steady at 5.25 per cent for six consecutive meetings stretching back to August.

 The statement from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) after its last meeting on March 20-21 was notable for dropping the banks explicit bias towards higher rates, a move seen by some as a baby step towards a cut later in 2007.

 It, however, said its predominant policy concern was that the risk inflation would not ease, and the details of the meeting later showed the Fed had not really altered its views on the risks to inflation and growth.

 Analysts believe the central bank will want more time to assess whether a softer pace of economic growth will lead to lower inflation and that it will once again leave its options open on the future direction of monetary policy.

 Bet on a Fed still on hold in May with their inflation bias intact, but with a somewhat softer view of current economic and inflation trends, said Scott Anderson, senior economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis.

 Flexibility on rates either on the upside or downside will be of paramount importance, he said.

 Interest rate futures, which are used as a measuring stick for potential Fed moves, show almost no chance of the FOMC cutting rates by mid-year, and prospects for an ease in August are less than one-in-five. 

 A report on non-farm payroll growth showed a slowdown in jobs growth, with only a modest 880,00 positions created, and a tick upward in the unemployment rate to 4.5 per cent.

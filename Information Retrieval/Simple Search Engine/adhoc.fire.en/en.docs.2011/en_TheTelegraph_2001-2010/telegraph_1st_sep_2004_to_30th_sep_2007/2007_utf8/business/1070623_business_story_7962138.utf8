 Nath talks tough on trade rift

 Nath: Firm stand

 New Delhi, June 22 (PTI): A day after the collapse of the G-4 talks, India today said the groups role as a consensus-building mechanism in WTO talks has come to an end. It also warned the US and the EU against trying to divide developing nations.

 It is the end of the day for G-4, commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath said on his return from Potsdam in Germany where talks among India, Brazil, the EU and the US aimed at completing WTOs Doha round by the year-end broke down yesterday.

 Nath also warned that efforts by the US and the EU to create differences among the developing countries, which have formed various groups to protect their interests in agriculture and industrial goods, would fail.

 I want to caution the EU and the US that any effort to divide developing countries will not succeed... India stands firm with the developing countries, he said when asked to comment on US trade representative Susan Schwabs remarks that advanced developing countries such as India, Brazil and China should open their markets to other developing nations.

 Blaming India and Brazil for being rigid, Schwab had said the G4 did not represent all 150 WTO members. Schwab and WTO director-general Pascal Lamy have made it clear negotiations would now be held in Geneva as talks among small groups have not been successful.

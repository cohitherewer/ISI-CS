 Tatas plug Corus coal shortfall

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Wide reach

 Calcutta, Aug. 3: Tata Steel has picked up a strategic stake in a coal block in Mozambique to ensure adequate supply for the UK-based Corus which it took over earlier this year.

 The Tatas will pick up a 35 per cent stake in the coal block, which is owned by Australias Riversdale Mining Ltd. The deal is worth Aus$100 million ($86 million).

 When the mine goes into production, Tata Steel plans to supply coking coal to Corus.

 A lack of captive raw material source for coal and iron ore is a major weakness in the operations of Corus.

 Prior to the acquisition of Corus, Tata Steel could access 100 per cent of its iron ore and 60 per cent of its coal requirements from captive sources. But after the takeover, captive sources are just about enough to meet 20 per cent of iron ore and 15 per cent of coal requirements of the Tata Steel-Corus combine.

 In 2006, Corus imported about 11 million tonnes of coal to feed its 19mt production capacity across plants in Europe. The coal, converted into coke for direct injection into blast furnaces, comes from Australia, Canada and the US.

 It is still not known how much coal Tata Steel will ship from the southeast African country to Corus. A Tata Steel official said the company was doing a study on how to utilise best the output of the Mozambique mine.

 A spokesperson of Corus told The Telegraph that the Mozambique coal would be an additional source of supply for the company.

 There are also plans to ship some coal from Mozambique to India to meet the enhanced requirement of Tata Steel. The Moatize coal province, the location of the Riversdale mine, has reportedly one of the largest coking coal and thermal coal reserves of the world.

 Riversdale had earlier said it wanted to build a capacity of 2-3 million tonnes per annum for export in the first phase. It was scouting for a partner to arrange for finances to complete the phase.

 The definitive agreements between Tata Steel and Riversdale are expected to be completed by November. 

 This is Tata Steels second acquisition of an overseas coal mine after a buyout in Australia.

 Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman said, The MoU with Riversdale is in the Tata Steels stated strategy of progressing towards raw material security for its global business.

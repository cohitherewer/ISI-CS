 Global players queue up for IFCI pie

 JAYATI GHOSE

 New Delhi, Sept. 12: Heavyweight foreign investors have set sights on the state-run Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI), which intends to sell a 26 per cent stake.

 It is learnt that private equity firm Blackstone, Standard Chartered Bank, Citigroup, Barclays, Swiss investment firm UBS Securities and the US-based hedge fund DE Shaw are likely to vie for the stake in the countrys oldest development financial institution.

 Home-grown Reliance Capital and local stalwarts such as the LIC, Punjab National Bank and the IDBI are also likely to submit expressions of interest. The last date for submitting bids for the stake sale is September 14.

 According to industry experts, it is the lure of the merchant banking licence that the IFCI holds and the prospect of it being turned into a full-fledged bank at a later date that are drawing big names to the stake sale.

 The IFCI already has licences for merchant banking, venture capital and asset reconstruction, which will provide an automatic route to global players to enter the booming financial sector in the country, said Ravi Trivedy, executive director of KPMG. 

 With market capitalisation of the IFCI at Rs 4,900 crore, global players find it a value buy compared to picking up a stake in any other hugely profitable financial institution, Trivedy added.

 Global players are also attracted by the prospect that the IFCI could be converted into a commercial bank on the lines of the other two development banks the IDBI and ICICI Bank, said U.S. Bhargava, former general manager of Punjab National Bank. 

 This would provide foreign players with more than a toehold in the financial sector before it is opened up to global competition in 2009.

 Analysts, however, feel that foreign investors got interested in the IFCI only after its financial position improved with the government deciding to inject Rs 1,300 crore into the firm during the current financial year.

 For the fiscal ended March 31, 2007, the IFCIs net profit stood at Rs 898 crore compared with a loss of Rs 74 crore, reported a year ago. However, the turnaround was led by profit from the sale of investments as opposed to a strong operating performance, Bhargava said. 

 The IFCI earned around Rs 730 crore by selling its investments in the National Stock Exchange and another Rs 60 crore by liquidating its stake in Icra. The profit on these transactions constituted 40 per cent of IFCIs income from operations in the financial year 2006-07, Bhargava said. 

 The Delhi-based financial institution had invited expressions of interest from domestic and foreign investors to buy a 26 per cent stake on August 14 this year. The names of the shortlisted candidates from among those submitting EoIs will be announced by September 25.

 The selection is a two-stage process and the whole thing is likely to be completed by January next year. 

 Foreign investors, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Deutsche Securities, already have equity interests in IFCI. 

 As many as 11 financial institutions, domestic as well as overseas, together held a 34.8 per cent stake in the company as on March 31, which includes an 8.4 per cent stake owned by the LIC and 5.01 per cent by the IDBI.

 Delay prompts Tata rethink on Bangla plan

New Delhi, March 21 (PTI): Peeved at the delay in getting the approval of the Bangladesh government, the Tata group today hinted it may shelve plans to invest over $3 billion to set up power, steel and fertiliser projects in the country.

 While we may be interested in investing in Bangladesh, the more time it takes to come to an agreement or more delays happen, the more difficult it will be to invest in the country, Indranil Sengupta, Tata groups chief of Bangladesh operations, said.

 Any organisation has limited financial and human resources, he said, and added the group was constantly looking for opportunities worldwide.

 As and when we keep committing our resources to such opportunities, the resources become more limited, he said, citing the example of the takeover of the Corus Group in a $12-billion deal.

 For example, there was Corus and there are other opportunities in the pipeline. The more well commit before the agreement with Bangladesh, the more difficult it will become to invest, Sengupta said.

 The Tata group had planned to invest more than $3 billion to set up power, steel and fertiliser plants, but the Bangladesh government has not given its approval so far. 

 However, Sengupta said the Tata group was keen to invest in the country as it had an immense potential. We are keen to invest in Bangladesh. We have completed our homework and are awaiting the governments nod.

 The group had offered to invest in a 2.4-million-tonne steel plant, two power plants, a coal mine and a fertiliser plant.

 Senguptas statement comes on the heels of the March 14 meeting between the groups resident director in Bangladesh, Manzer Hussain, and the countrys communication adviser, M.A. Matin.

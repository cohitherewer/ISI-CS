 The post office is finally coming of age as an insurer, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 Come 2008, the 14-player life insurance industry will see fresh competition India Post. The postal department, which has been selling life insurance products for the past 113 years, has decided to hive off its insurance business into a subsidiary that will be brought under the purview of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority. 

 India Post will now offer more products and give a higher return to its policyholders by deploying the funds mobilised under its Postal Life Insurance (PLI) and Rural Postal Life Insurance (RPLI) schemes in equities. 

 As of now, India Post sells seven plans under PLI and RPLI endowment assurance (Santosh), whole life assurance (Suraksha), convertible whole life assurance (Suvidha), anticipated endowment assurance (Sumangal), joint life endowment assurance (Yugal Suraksha), 10-year money-back plan (Gram Priya) and a childrens policy.

 Postal life insurance policies are sold only to employees of central, state and local governments, defence services, government-aided educational institutions, all nationalised banks, corporations, boards, organisations and financial institutions such as the UTI, the IDBI, SAIL, BSNL, MTNL and the railways.

 Postal life insurance was born in 1884 118 years after the postal system in the country was established by Lord Clive to insure the lives of native postal employees other than those in high positions as the insurance companies at that time were unwilling to cover common natives. 

 In March 1995, postal life insurance was extended to cover people in rural areas. 

 PLI and RPLI plans are framed by the ministry of finance and the total premium mobilised by the department of post through its 155,837 branch network (of which 89 per cent are in rural areas) goes to the government which in turn gives India Post a commission and the policyholders an assured rate of return. 

 In 1956, all insurance companies in the country were nationalised. This crippled India Posts ability to leverage upon its vast branch network almost three times of total bank branches in the country to become the largest life insurance company. 

 The formation of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority in 1999 made the situation more difficult for India Post as it could not offer any new product, stuck as it was between the two regulators. Its plan to offer group life insurance to BSNL employees in 2003 has not seen the light of day. 

 In 2005, the finance ministry decided that it would no longer offer special rates to the department of posts for deposits under the PLI and the RPLI funds. 

 India Post had to look for alternative investment avenues to sustain the higher-than-market rate of return and bonus that it had been giving to its policyholders so far. Being the government-sponsored scheme, the premium for PLI and RPLI plans are significantly lower 15 to 20 per cent than even those of the LIC.

 From April 1 this year, the department has been asked to invest these funds on its own. But the department has no experience in full-fledged fund management. Therefore, it will follow IRDA guidelines one-third of the total corpus of PLI and RPLI will be invested each year in government securities. The department will manage another third of the funds itself. For this it has started scouting for professional fund managers. An investment committee has been set up to look for a suitable fund manager.

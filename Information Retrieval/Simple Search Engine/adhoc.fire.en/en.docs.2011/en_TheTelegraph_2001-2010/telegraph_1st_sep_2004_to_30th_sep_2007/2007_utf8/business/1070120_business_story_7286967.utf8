 Jet Air flies back into profit in third quarter

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 19: Its a comeback for Jet Airways with a profit in the third quarter of this fiscal after suffering losses over the last two quarters. The numbers are, however, lower than what it recorded in the corresponding period last fiscal.

 The company has recorded a profit after tax of Rs 40 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2006, down 34 per cent from Rs 61 crore in the corresponding previous period . 

 The company had suffered a loss of Rs 55.1 crore during the second quarter of 2006-07.

 Profit before tax added up to Rs 61.9 crore, including a sale-leaseback, compared with a profit before tax of Rs 95.4 crore in the same period in 2005-06, a drop of 35 per cent. 

 Revenues of the airline grew 35.4 per cent to Rs 2,030 crore for the quarter from Rs 1,499 crore. 

 This is a significant improvement for us and has been achieved through higher load factor and better yields. Also the pressure on our international sector has eased and the losses have narrowed down, said Wolfgang Prock-Schauer, chief executive officer of Jet Airways. 

 Domestic operations accounted for 78 per cent of revenues compared with 86 per cent in the third quarter last fiscal. 

 Owing to the peak season, the company achieved a domestic seat factor of 70.1 per cent for the quarter against 72.5 per cent in the same period last fiscal, despite a 40 per cent increase in industry capacity over this period.

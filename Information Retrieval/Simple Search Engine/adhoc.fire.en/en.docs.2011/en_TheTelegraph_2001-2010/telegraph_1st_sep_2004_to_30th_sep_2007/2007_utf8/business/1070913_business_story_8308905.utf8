 Taiwan electronics show in Chennai

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Sept. 12: A three-day Taipei International Electronics show, Taitronics India 2007, will be inaugurated here on Friday. 

 The Taipei World Trade Centre and Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association have partnered with the Tamil Nadu government and the Confederation of Indian Industry to organise the show, Walter Yeh, executive vice-president of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (Taitra), told reporters here. 

 He said Taitra would sponsor 50 people visiting Taiwan from India, including their air tickets and accommodation. 

 India is the 20th largest trading partner of Taiwan, according to statistics up to June 2007, he said. Bilateral trade between the two countries has grown 68 per cent over the past year and is expected to go up further, he said.

 We have entered a new era by coming to India for the first time ever with the largest expo on electronics in Asia, Yeh said. Around 80 Taiwanese companies from the information and communication technologies (ICT) sector will showcase their products at the exhibition. 

 The event will be sponsored by HSBC and be a part of the CII-organised annual mega ICT show Connect 2007 at the Chennai Trade Centre. 

 A combination of Indias software skills and Taiwans expertise in electronics hardware could make them an unbeatable team, Yeh said. Taiwanese company Wintek already supplies the largest number of flat panel displays to Nokia. Nokia has set up a manufacturing plant at Sriperumbudur, 45 km from Chennai. 

 Firms participating in the show include Holteck Semiconductor, Hobbes and Chyang Fun Industry.

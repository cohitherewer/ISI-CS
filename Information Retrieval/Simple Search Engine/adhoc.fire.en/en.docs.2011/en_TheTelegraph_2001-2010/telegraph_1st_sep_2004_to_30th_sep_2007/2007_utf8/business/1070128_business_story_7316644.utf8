 UBS buys StanChart mutual for $120 m

 Sold out

 Mumbai, Jan. 27 (PTI): UBS Global Asset Management has acquired Standard Chartereds mutual funds business in India for $120 million.

 Following an agreement signed between the two entities, the global banking major has sold its entire stake in Standard Chartered Trustee Company and Standard Chartered Asset Management Company to UBS for about $120 million, a StanChart release said here.

 The transaction is, however, conditional upon certain regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2007.

 Standard Chartered Asset Management Company and Standard Chartered Trustee Company are the investment manager and the trustee respectively of its mutual fund.

 Together, the companies to be sold represent the mutual fund business of Standard Chartered in India. The transaction, however, does not include Standard Chartereds mutual fund distribution business, which the bank would continue to pursue, the release added.

 Its assets under management, which include debt and equity funds, stood at $3.1 billion as on January 25 this year.

 Management of mutual funds is not our core business and the time has come for us to evaluate whether we are adding enough value to the business for customers, Standard Chartered group executive director Kai Nargolwala said. 

 According to Nargolwala, the decision to sell the mutual funds business would enable Standard Chartered play to its global strengths in the distribution of third-party financial services products.

 India remains one of our key markets. We will continue to distribute mutual funds on an open architecture basis as well as invest in and grow our core business there, he said.

 In addition to the disposal of its fund management business here, Standard Chartered Wealth Management would form a strategic alliance with UBS Global Asset Management to distribute mutual funds in Asia, Africa and West Asia.

 This alliance would provide Standard Chartered access to UBS Global Asset Managements capabilities, the release added.

 Cabinet approves industry corridor

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: The Union cabinet today gave an in-principle approval to the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor project that envisages an investment of $90-100 billion over the next 10 years with Japanese assistance.

 The government approved the industrial corridor project outline on the eve of the visit of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said information and broadcasting minister P. R. Das Munshi.

 Along with this project, the cabinet gave the nod to the setting up of the 1,483-km dedicated freight corridor between Delhi and Mumbai for high-speed movement of wagons. 

 The construction of the freight corridor will begin from 2009-10 and be over by 2012. For the industrial corridor, the first phase will cover six states Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. It will be done in tandem with the freight corridor. As many as 100 to 120 projects are likely to come up in the industrial corridor.

 In Phase-I, six investment regions of more than 200 sq km each and six industrial areas of about 100 sq km each will be developed. 

 The cabinet committee on economic affairs approved six new railway lines and a gauge conversion exercise at an investment of Rs 2,796 crore.

 The 101-km Bhojhipura-Pilibhit-Tanakpur gauge conversion at a cost of Rs 145 crore is likely to be completed by 2009-10, said Das Munshi.

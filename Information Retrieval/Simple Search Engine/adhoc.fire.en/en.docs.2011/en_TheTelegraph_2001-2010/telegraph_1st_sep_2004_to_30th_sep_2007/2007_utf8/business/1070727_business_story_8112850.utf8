The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 June flavour in Tata Tea cup

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 26: Tata Tea garnered a 19.2 per cent share of the packet tea market in June in terms of volume, leaving its nearest competitor behind at 18.6 per cent, according to an A.C. Neilson survey.

 Percy Siganporia, managing director of the company, hailed it as a momentous occasion as this was the first time that the company gained pole position in the domestic packet tea segment.

 Our focus will be on the branded packet tea segment. The survey by an independent agency shows that we are on the right track, Siganporia added. 

 A Tata Tea statement said the company was gaining market share steadily over the last five years.

 The domestic packet tea market is 400 million kg a year and it has been growing at 4-5 per cent annually. 

 While Tata Tea is ahead in terms of volume, it still trails its closest competitor in terms of value.

 Tata Tea and Hindustan Unilever Ltd are the two leading packet tea companies in the country.

 Sources said Hindustan Unilever was ahead of Tata Tea in volume terms in the April-June quarter and in the January-June period. To focus more on the marketing of packet tea, the company is taking steps to demerge its plantation operations into separate entities in the north and south.

 Tata Tea has five major brands. With the acquisition of Tetley Group in 2000, the combined entity now represents the second largest global branded tea operations with products in more than 40 countries.

 Tata Tea had earlier bought Good Earth and Eight Clock Coffee in the US as well as Jemca in Czech. It has recently acquired trademarks Vitax and Flosana in Poland.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Post office taste for equity

 A STAFF REPORTER

 New direction

 Calcutta, Feb. 21: Post offices may soon start offering stock broking services under the Finmart banner. 

 The government allows sale of mutual fund products and gilts in post offices under the Finmart banner.

 IDBI Capital Markets Services has recently made a presentation on department of post to offer stock broking services through post offices to their customers, according to S. Muhnot, managing director and chief executive of IDBI Capital Market Services Ltd. 

 The IDBI subsidiary already has an exclusive arrangement with India Post for selling government securities to retail investors.

 When you talk about growth in the Indian equity market, retail participation must come from smaller cities, towns and rural areas. The best way you can reach these pockets is by tying up with India Post and banks, which have the largest points of presence among all other distribution channels, Muhnot said. 

 India Post has 54,000 post offices across the country and the department has also earmarked Rs 4,000 crore to invest in technology. This opens up a huge opportunity to reach out to an untapped market, he added.

 Muhnot said the department of post has also shown interest in online stock broking services as an alternative avenue generation. 

 IDBI Capital Market Services offers only online stock broking services and the company is focusing on tie-ups with banks to offer this service to bank customers. 

 It has tie-ups with IDBI, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Rajasthan, Oriental Bank of Commerce and Karur Vysya Bank. 

 We are at an advanced stage of discussion with the United Bank of India and Uco Bank, Muhnot said. 

 With this arrangement, you can increase your client base in quick time without spending much on creating new infrastructure, he added. 

 IDBI Capital Market Services is also planning to expand its business through a franchisee network. We invited applications for franchisees and we want to have at least 150 for our online stock broking service, Paisabuilder.in, during the first year itself, Muhnot said.

 IDBI Capital Market Services is also coming out with a private equity fund.

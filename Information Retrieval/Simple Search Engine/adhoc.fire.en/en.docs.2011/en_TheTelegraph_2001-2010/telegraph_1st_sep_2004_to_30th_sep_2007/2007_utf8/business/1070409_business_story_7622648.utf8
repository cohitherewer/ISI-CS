 Tea union nod to Tata proposal

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA 

 Green signal

 Calcutta, April 8: Tata Tea seems to have finally made headway into the four gardens in north Bengal. The INTUC-backed National Union of Plantation Workers has agreed to the Tatas proposal of the restructured North India Plantation Operations (Nipo). It will also allow its workers to become shareholders in the new company, Amalgamated Plantations Pvt Ltd.

 This comes as a major breakthrough for Tata Tea as all the four unions, including two large ones the National Union of Plantation Workers and the Citu-backed Cha Bagaan Mazdoor Union had unanimously agreed to reject the Tata proposal of employee participation as shareholders in the new company.

 However, there is still one clause that the union plans to take up with Tata Tea.

 We have received the letter and have carefully gone through it. It assures us that the service conditions of the workers will remain unchanged, including all benefits of gratuity, bonus and provident fund. The new company will also honour other welfare provisions. But we do not agree with one clause that said the tea produced by this new company would be sold only to Tata Tea. If it is indeed a new company and workers are becoming shareholders by taking on a financial burden, why limit the produce of the gardens, which are expected to improve after the implementation of this model, to Tata Tea only? If one gets a good rate, why can they not sell the produce to any buyer offering the best price? asked Mani Darnal, senior joint general secretary of National Union of Plantation Workers. 

 Darnal added that this issue needs further discussion with Tata Tea but said the union will go ahead and organise a workshop with the workers of the four gardens to apprise them of the exact scheme and assure them that all the current benefits will remain unchanged. The workshop will be held before April 15.

 Tata Tea had to send the letters dated March 31 to the unions despite making presentations to them on the exact nature and structure of the new company for the last one year. The unions were unsure and sceptical about the status of the workers after the implementation of the new structure. 

 The two largest unions in Assam, which include the Assam Cha Mazdoor Sangh, have also approved the scheme.

 There are about 30,000 workers in the four estates in north Bengal and 20 in Assam.

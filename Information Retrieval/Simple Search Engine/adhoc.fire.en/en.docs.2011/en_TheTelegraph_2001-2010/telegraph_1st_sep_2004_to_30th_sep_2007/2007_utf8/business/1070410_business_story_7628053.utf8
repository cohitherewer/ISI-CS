 Calcutta, April 9: HP is betting big on the inkjet printersegment, which is enjoying a 100 per cent growth on the back of spending by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the state.

 SMEs and small office and home office (SOHO) users comprise around 38 per cent of HPs printing and imaging business. According to a survey by AMI Partners, the use of printers by SMEs is expected to grow by 22 per cent in the next couple of years.

 The HP Officejet Pro single and multi-function printers have a speed of 35 to 36 pages per minute compared with 10 to 12 pages per minute from a laser printer. Its cost per page is also lower by 25 to 30 per cent compared with a laser printer. Small businesses can save more with such printers, said Ashwini K. Aggarwal, country business manager, imaging and printing group, Hewlett Packard India Sales Pvt Ltd. 

 The figures for the Officejet Pro have been arrived at independently by printing research company SpencerLab Digital Colour Laboratory.

 HP had earlier commissioned a study by IMRB to find out the requirement and preferences of SMEs.

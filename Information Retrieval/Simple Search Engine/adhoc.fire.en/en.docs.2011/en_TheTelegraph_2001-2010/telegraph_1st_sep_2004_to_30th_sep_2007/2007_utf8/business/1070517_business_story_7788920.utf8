 Warburg to pocket Bausch amp; Lomb

 Chicago, May 16 (Reuters): Eyecare company Bausch amp; Lomb Inc has agreed to the $3.67-billion takeover offer by Warburg Pincus.

 Warburg Pincus will acquire all the outstanding shares of Bausch amp; Lomb for $65 per share in cash. It will also assume about $830 million in debt.

 Shares of the company were trading at $67.40 in premarket activity, an indication that investors may expect a higher bid.

 The offer is only a 5.7 per cent premium to where Bausch amp; Lomb shares closed on Tuesday, but share prices have been rising for several weeks on rumours that it would be the target of a leveraged buyout.

 The deal is not a surprise given the stocks action, Robert W. Baird analyst, Jeffrey D. Johnson, said. 

 This looks like a pretty fair deal, Johnson said.

 The shares pre-market rise to $67 above the $65-a-share deal price suggests speculation of a higher bid, Johnson said. If I were a shareholder here, I would not be expecting much upside from $67, Johnson said.

 Warburg Pincus has offered to pay nearly 28 times of the estimated 2007 earnings per share for the company, and 9.5 times of the estimated 2007 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.

 This acquisition by a private equity firm will help Bausch address its issues away from the investor spotlight, Johnson said. The issues include dealing with product liability lawsuits and getting their accounting in order.

 RBI not to slap fee on cheque payments 

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, May 4: Bank customers can heave a sigh of relief. The Reserve Bank is not planning to levy a charge for cheque payments.

 To promote electronic transfer of funds, an RBI group had suggested last month that payments through cheques should be charged.

 However, a release issued by the central bank today said the RBI has decided not to accept the recommendation of the internal study group to levy a charge for paper-based transactions.

 The study groups report was posted on the RBI website last month for public comments.

 The central bank had not accepted a similar suggestion received twice in the past, the press release said.

 The report had also suggested that customers should not be allowed to pay credit card dues and mobile bills through cheques and instead pay the bills through the electronic mode.

 Suggesting that electronic fund transfers should be made cheaper than paper mode payments, the report said, To begin with, ECS-based transactions should be made free for three years. Legal protection should also be made available to such transfers.

 The RBI said recommendations of any study group internal or external constituted by the Reserve Bank are only suggestions and do not reflect the views of the central bank.

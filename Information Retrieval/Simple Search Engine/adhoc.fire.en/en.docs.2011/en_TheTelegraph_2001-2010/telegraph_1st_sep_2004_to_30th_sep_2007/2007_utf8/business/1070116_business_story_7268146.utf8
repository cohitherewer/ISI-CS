 Windfall awaits Nestle shareholders 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 15: Nestle India today said its board of directors has approved a proposal to distribute about Rs 86 crore to shareholders from the companys share premium account and general reserves.

 Under the scheme, the amount in the share premium account and part of the general reserves will be utilised for returning cash to shareholders after paying taxes, the company said in a statement here.

 About Rs 43.2 crore is in the share premium account. Further, up to Rs 43.09 crore, transferred by the company to its general reserve account during 1981-97 in excess of the prescribed 10 per cent of the companys profits, would be used for the purpose.

 This amount would be reclassified and credited to the profit and loss account for distribution to shareholders as special dividend, quot; the company said.

 Nestle said the scheme was approved in the interest of shareholders as cash will give them an opportunity to earn better returns as compared with those earnings had the company invested in short-term liquid instruments.

 The scheme, however, would require the approval of Delhi High Court, shareholders, creditors and the Bombay Stock Exchange and a record date would be fixed to determine the number of shareholders who will receive the shares. 

 HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) is the financial adviser and Amarchand amp; Mangaldas amp; Suresh A Shroff amp; Company is the legal adviser to the scheme.

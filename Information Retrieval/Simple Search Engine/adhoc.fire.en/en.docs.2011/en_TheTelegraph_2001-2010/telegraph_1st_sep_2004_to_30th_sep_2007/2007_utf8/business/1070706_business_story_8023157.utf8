 Two new variants of Logan 

 Chennai/New Delhi, July 5 (PTI): Mahindra Renault today announced the launch of two new variants of its Logan in the petrol and diesel versions.

 The 1.6 GLX petrol vehicle would be priced at Rs 5.35 lakh and the 1.5 dCi DLX diesel model would cost Rs 6.11 lakh, Rajesh Jejurikar, managing director of the company, said.

 The new variants were introduced on customer demand, he said. Adjustable rear-head restraint, truck-room light, outside mirrors with manual adjustment, front and rear power windows and central locking systems were the additional features of the new models.

 Spotlight on regional cooperation in trade

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 1: Regional blocs may be a viable option for developing countries looking for cooperation in trade as WTO negotiations have reached a stalemate. Trade blocs such as Saarc and Safta have an important role to play, said external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee.

 The trend of discussions in the Doha round seems to suggest that development is not a core concern of the developed countries. Growth with development is important for us. Saarcs theme of commerce for mutual benefit will open up entirely new avenues for dialogue, said Mukherjee.

 Mukherjee was in the city to address a seminar organised by the ministry of external affairs and Ficci on Saarc.

 If Saarc succeeds, Southeast Asia and central Asia will open up to countries under the block at a faster pace.

 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said the formation of Saarc was imperative for economic stability in the region, industrial development and eradication of poverty.

 Mukherjee is optimistic about the future of Saarc. India is the only country which shares geographical borders with a majority of Saarc nations. We should, therefore, think of prote- ctionism as a strategy to safeguard against competition, Mukherjee added.

 Bank joy at mutuals sorrow

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Gain some, lose some

Mumbai, Feb. 28: Even as banks were left disappointed with finance minister not announcing tax reliefs on deposits, they have a reason cheer. In a move which will help banks in their deposit mobilisation efforts, P. Chidambaram increased the dividend distribution tax on money market mutual funds.

 Bank deposits have been competing against this instrument and the move is expected to see more money coming into bank deposits. 

 Announcing his Budget proposals for 2007-08, Chidambaram said that dividends distributed by money market mutual funds and liquid mutual funds enjoy concessional tax rates giving rise to huge arbitrage opportunities.

 To address this distortion, he raised the dividend distribution tax on dividends paid by such entities to 25 per cent for all investors.

 Reacting to the move, senior bankers said that the increase in dividend distribution tax will bring down such mutual funds at par with bank deposits and that debt market funds will now be not that attractive to investors vis--vis other instruments.

 Reacting to the move, Gautam Vir, managing director and CEO, Development Commercial Bank, said, The banking sector had a mixed bag of fortune. There were large hopes that the tax relief for bank deposit interest would be increased to help banks garner more deposits. Instead of that, there has been an increase in the dividend distribution tax on money market mutual funds. These funds were drawing away bulk money from banks, and thus bank deposits may regain some lustre.

 Kalpana Morparia, joint managing director, ICICI Bank also shared Virs view. Speaking to The Telegraph, she said that the banking system will be a major beneficiary of the move to raise dividend distribution tax as fund flow to bank deposits could increase.

 Commercial banks have in the recent past, seen their advances rising by more than 30 per cent even as deposit growth was less than 20 per cent.

 They were looking forward to the finance minister in announcing major tax reliefs on deposits. The expectation was that Chidambaram would dole out incentives of deposits of three years apart from five years that is applicable now.

 A senior official from a private sector bank said that finance ministers proposal has come at a right time as interest rates on deposits have been on the rise since the past few months. 

 While they are ruling at over 9 per cent on certain maturity buckets, it is expected that investors will increasingly put their savings into bank deposits, particularly with outlook for stock markets appearing bleak for the short-term.

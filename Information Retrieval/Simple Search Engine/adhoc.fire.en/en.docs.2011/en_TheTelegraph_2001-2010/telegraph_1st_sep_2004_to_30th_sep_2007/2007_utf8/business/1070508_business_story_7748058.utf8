 DoCoMo spikes Hutch deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 7: NTT DoCoMo, the No. 1 mobile phone company in Japan, has gone back on an agreement to licence its wireless Internet technology i-mode to Hutchison Essar.

 DoCoMo said after the change of ownership in Hutchison Essar it was not possible to pursue the arrangements for i-mode with the Indian company.

 In February, British giant Vodafone bought the majority stake in Hutchison Essar from Hong Kong-based Hutchison Telecom International Limited.

 Sources said Vodafone was planning to offer its own value-added services in India which would have created a conflict of interest vis--vis i-mode.

 Officials from Hutchison Essar were not available for comment.

 DoCoMo officials said that it still considered India an attractive market and that it would look for other options for i-mode in the country. 

 DoCoMo and Hutchison Essar had signed an agreement in December 2006 on i-mode. The plan was to offer the service this year.

 DoCoMo offered the rights to Hutchison Essar to provide the service on the Indian companys GSM, GPRS and W-CDMA networks. 

 i-mode gives its subscribers access to rich content, e-mail, games and other Internet-based services on their handsets.

 The agreement with Hutchison Essar offered DoCoMo a foothold in India. DoCoMo was banking on the success of the deal for entry to other Asian markets.

 More than 53 million people in 16 countries of Europe and Asia-Pacific subscribe to i-mode. The service is available in Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan and the UK.

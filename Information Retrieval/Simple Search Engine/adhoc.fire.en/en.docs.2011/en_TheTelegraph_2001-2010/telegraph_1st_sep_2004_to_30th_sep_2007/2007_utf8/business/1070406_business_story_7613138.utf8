 Calcutta, April 5: China Mining Engineering Equipment Company has shown interest in joining the Coal India-DVC consortium to revive Mining amp; Allied Machinery Corporation (MAMC) in Durgapur.

 Coal India chairman-cum-managing director Partha S. Bhattacharyya said, MAMC had long been a supplier of equipment such as continuous miners for our underground mines. After the closure of the ailing company, it has become difficult to get new equipment as well as spare parts for the old ones. We are keen to revive the company so that we can locally produce the mining equipment and their spare parts to be used by us and other mining companies as well.

 Meanwhile, Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) has lent CIL support to revive MAMC as the power producer also wants to source the equipment and spare parts for its proposed mining ventures.

 Recently, at a meeting of the Indo-China working group, China Mining Engineering Equipment Company showed interest in setting up a manufacturing unit in India, but was not sure of the demand in the domestic market. We then suggested reviving MAMC at Durgapur which was closed down, said N.C. Jha, director (technical), Coal India Ltd. We (along with members of the Chinese company) will visit the Durgapur plant soon to assess its existing condition and infrastructure. After that a feasibility report will be prepared on whether mining equipment such as continuous miners or spare parts would be made, he said.

 CIL is also expected to sign the memorandum of understanding with DVC soon for the revival of MAMC. Our next board meeting is expected to approve the proposal and once it is done, we will sign the MoU with DVC, Bhattacharyya said. Following that a formal revival proposal will be sent to the state government, which will then forward it to the Union government for its approval, he added.

 However, no decision has yet been taken on the investment pattern. A special purpose vehicle may be floated to accommodate many equity investors, said Jha.

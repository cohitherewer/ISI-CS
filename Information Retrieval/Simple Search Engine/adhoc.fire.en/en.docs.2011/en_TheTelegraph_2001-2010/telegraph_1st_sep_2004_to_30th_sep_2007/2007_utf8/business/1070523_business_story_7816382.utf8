 Tax on seven more services 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 22: Seven new services such as rents for commercial purposes and ring tones supplied by content providers to telecom firms will become expensive from next month with the government bringing these under the tax net.

 The services, which also include asset management by individuals and work contracts for commercial and residential construction, are taxable according to the Finance Act 2007 and notified by the Central Board of Excise and Customs today. Tax on these services will be effective from June 1, the notification issued by the board said.

 With the addition of these seven, the number of taxable services has increased to about 100. Service providers will have to pay 12 per cent tax in addition to 3 per cent education cess, taking the total tax to 12.36 per cent.

 Various telecom services like telecom connection, pager, leased circuit, communication through telegraph, telex and fax will also come under the tax net as part of telecom service. Some of these services are already taxable.

 However, property owners have been given a marginal relief as property tax will be deductible for the purpose of service tax on commercial rentals though any penalty paid under the property tax cannot be deducted.

 The notification also broadened the existing service tax net to include maxi-cab capable of carrying more than 12 persons for educational bodies or vehicles for driving schools, rent-a-cab service, tent service, event management and manpower recruitment. 

 The notification, however, exempted services provided for execution of works contract in port construction. Though, services provided for repair, renovation, restoration, maintenance or repair in relation to existing ports would be liable for service tax. The finance act has raised the threshold for service tax exemption for small providers from Rs 4 lakh to Rs 8 lakh.

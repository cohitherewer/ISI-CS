 Mumbai, Feb. 14: Eleven MoUs were signed between Indian and Italian companies during the visit of Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi here today.

 Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) has entered into a letter of intent with Carraro Technologies while Fiat Auto and Tata Motors expanded their relationship to cover new areas.

 M amp;M and Carraro Technologies India will share technology for tractor manufacturing. According to the agreement, M amp;M will use the Carraro 345 agricultural transmission technology in its new tractor range called 475 Deluxe. 

 The Carraro group has been operating in India since 1998 to produce agricultural transmissions for the local market.

 The other MoUs signed include that of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) with Eni SpA. It signed two agreements for exchange of participating interest in two offshore areas of India and Congo.

 Bhel has also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Felex Sistemi Integrati SpA for collaboration in defence-related electronics.

 Bank of Baroda (BoB) has entered into an MoU with Pioneer Investments, a leading asset management company in Italy, to form a joint venture in asset management in India. The joint venture will offer a range of mutual fund products. 

 Pioneer will bring its global experience in portfolio management, while BoB will bring its local expertise and access to its wide distribution network.

 Prodi asked India to offer easier market access to Italy and also reduce its peak customs tariff at a business forum organised by Assocham, CII and Ficci.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath, however, opposed market access to developed nations in the name of agricultural subsidies saying that India could not afford to do this to safeguard the interest of its farmers.

 Assocham president Venugopal Dhoot praised the investor-friendly industrial climate in Italy. He was of the opinion that both India and Italy should identify their trade potentials.

 Overseas phone calls set to get cheaper

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi, March 21: The telecom regulator today announced a 37 per cent cut in a fee paid by operators to state-run BSNL for fostering services in rural areas a decision that is expected to make a dent in overseas call tariffs.

 The total amount of levy (access deficit charge) for the financial year 2007-08 is being reduced to approximately Rs 2,000 crore from the existing level of Rs 3,200 crore, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India said in a statement here.

 Outgoing ISD calls are likely to become cheaper as the levy of 80 paise on such calls has been scrapped, while the levy on incoming ISD calls has been brought down by 38 per cent to Re 1 from the existing Rs 1.60 per minute.

 While mobile market leader Bharti Airtel was quick to announce that benefits of this reduction will be passed on to the customer, others complained that the cut was lower than expected.

 Trais decision would come into effect from April 1.

 The ADC on percentage revenue share basis of the telecom operators has been reduced by 50 per cent. Telecom operators would now have to pay 0.75 per cent of their adjusted gross revenues towards ADC from the existing 1.50 per cent, Trai said.

 Trai is working on the premise that the lowering of tariffs will lead to a higher growth in incoming international calls, which is estimated to contribute Rs 1,400 crore. 

 Trai said ADC is on its way out and should be merged with the Universal Service Obligation Fund, if the telecom department thinks it necessary. ADC, which is for a limited period, gives time to operators to rebalance the tariff during the transition period.

 The reduction in ADC would give greater flexibility to service providers to cut tariffs and offer innovative packages to consumers, Trai said.

 The reduction in arbitrage in international incoming calls would provide less incentive to the ILD grey market.

 Meanwhile, the cabinet is

 likely to take up tomorrow a proposal to raise the

 FDI limit in telecom to 74 per cent. .

 Its a Bentley, old or new

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 OLD WORLD CHARM

 New Delhi, April 9: Mind paying a few crores for a used car? Look out for Bentleys booty as it enters Indias pre-owned vehicle market.

 India has exceeded our expectations and the customer base is constantly growing. We are looking at the used car business as a serious model to satisfy customers as the company is limiting its production globally to maintain exclusivity, Ian Gorusch, Bentley Motors regional director (West Asia, Africa and India), said.

 Bentley manufactures about 9,000 cars a year.

 In its three years of operations in India, Bentley has sold about 70 cars, of which 28 were sold last year. This year, 25 cars have been allocated. Bentley will re-sell cars that have been sold to Indian customers.

 The company has already received enquiries from customers but it is yet to get any confirmed bookings. 

 Bentley sells the Arnage, Continental and Flying Spur, all of which are in the crore-plus price category, in India.

 The company is also planning to roll out its GT Convertible in India next month. The convertible will sport a price tag of Rs 2.2 crore. Only five cars have been allocated so far.

 The company will also roll out the limited edition Brooklands Coupe, priced at around Rs 4 crore, next year.

 We want to make a passionate Bentley customer drive the car he likes, even if it is a used one, while he waits for the new car to arrive, Gorusch said. 

 The used car customers are going to be special as the pre-owned Bentley will be far costlier than other normal badges, he said, adding the company was adopting a personalised approach to promote the new initiative.

 A year-old used Bentley will cost 10-15 per cent less than the original, said Satya Prakash Bagla of Exclusive Motors, dealers of Bentley. 

 These cars will go through a strict quality check by the company. Customers can seek an extended warranty of seven years if the warranty period has expired, said Bagla.

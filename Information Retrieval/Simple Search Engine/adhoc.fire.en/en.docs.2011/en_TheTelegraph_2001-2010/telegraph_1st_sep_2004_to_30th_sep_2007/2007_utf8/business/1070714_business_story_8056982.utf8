 Global trends spur sensex

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 STANDING TALL

 Mumbai, July 13: Strong global cues and a robust performance by Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) today spurred share indices to record levels for the eighth time in 10 days. 

 The BSE sensex scaled a new peak of 15330.73 before closing the day at 15272.72, a net rise of 180.68 points, or 1.20 per cent, over yesterdays close of 15092.04.

 RIL, which has the largest weightage of over 12 per cent on the sensex, today ended at Rs 1,768.50, a gain of around 3 per cent, or Rs 49.60, over its previous close.

 It came a day after the government approved the groups special economic zone in Navi Mumbai.

 Brokers said liquidity in the markets, particularly from foreign institutional investors (FIIs), was also strong because of positive expectations from the quarterly numbers of various companies. The sentiment also improved with the government announcing a relief package to exporters who have been hit by the appreciating rupee against the dollar.

 FIIs have pumped in about Rs 7,845 crore into equities so far this month.

 The markets opened on a strong note because of favourable global cues. The firm trend on Wall Street yesterday was followed by a sharp rally in Asian markets today. The Hang Seng ended up 290.27 points, the Kospi 53.18 points, the Nikkei 254.81 points and the Singapore index 30.05 points.

 Metal shares continued to hog the limelight. Analysts said their gains came on expectations that the industry would see more consolidation after Rio Tinto offered to buy Canadas Alcan. While Hindalco Industries rose 6 per cent to its highest close in five months, Tata Steel saw gains of around 3.5 per cent to close at Rs 694.75. 

 Infosys also saw some buying because of unconfirmed reports that it might bid for Capgemini.

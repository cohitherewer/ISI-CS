 Chambers fret over rupee rise

 New Delhi, Sept. 23 (PTI): A robust rupee has emerged as the most crucial stumbling block for 91 per cent of the countrys exporters and a Ficci survey doesnt paint a rosy picture for the next six months.

 The survey conducted in the first quarter of 2007-08 revealed that for 91 per cent of the respondents from 286 companies, the appreciating rupee was the main impediment to business performance.

 In a survey conducted in the last quarter of 2006-07, 75 per cent of the exporters were concerned over rupee appreciation.

 Assocham study

 The appreciating rupee is likely to affect Indias export of gems and jewellery as the rising currency will make these exports less competitive in key markets such as the US, Hong Kong and the UAE.

 Export of gems and jewellery will be adversely affected if the rupee appreciation against the dollar is not arrested, Assocham said in a study on the gems and jewellery pattern.

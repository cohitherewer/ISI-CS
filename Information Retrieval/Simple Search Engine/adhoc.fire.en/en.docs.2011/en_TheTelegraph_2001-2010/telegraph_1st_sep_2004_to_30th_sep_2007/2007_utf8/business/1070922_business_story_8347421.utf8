 Hint of home loan rate cut

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 21: HDFC Ltd, the biggest player in the home loan segment, may reduce its interest rates next week as the cost of funds has come down.

 There is a case for an interest rate cut. A decision will be taken next week but we have not yet decided on the quantum of the cut, executive director Renu Karnad said.

 Sources said the rates could come down by at least 25 basis points and could affect existing loans too.

 HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said the cost of funds for the lender had come down and it would, therefore, review its rates.

 The funding costs have come down by 50 basis points and we will review our lending rates in a week, he said.

 Parekh said he expected loans to rise 26-27 per cent in the second quarter this fiscal for HDFC. For the whole fiscal, he sees a growth of 20-25 per cent.

 Interest rates on home loans have steadily increased since the Reserve Bank of India began raising rates to control inflationary expectations. 

 Property prices have softened and sales have slowed down, Parekh said.

 Banking sources said interest rates had risen by at least 400 basis points in floating rate home loans. For fixed rate loans it was more. This, coupled with other moves of the central bank, has led to some softening of the demand for loans in the recent past.

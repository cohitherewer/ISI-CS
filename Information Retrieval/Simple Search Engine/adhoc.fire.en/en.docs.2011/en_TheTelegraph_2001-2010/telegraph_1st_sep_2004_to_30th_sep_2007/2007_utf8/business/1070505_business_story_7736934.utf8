 More measures to tame prices

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chidambaram: Confident

 New Delhi, May 4: The government will intensify the measures initiated to bring down the prices of essential commodities. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram said a two-pronged strategy has been adopted to tackle inflation. Excise and customs duty cuts on various commodities will have an immediate effect, while the policy initiatives taken by the RBI will have a long-term impact.

 We expect the wholesale price index to ease further in May, he said. 

 The results are showing already. The rate of inflation fell to 5.77 per cent for the week ended April 21. The rate was above 6 per cent in the preceding two weeks. Lower prices of manufactured products and food items contributed to the decline.

 Monetary measures take time to have the desired effect. They are already showing results. Demand growth is being moderated, so is credit growth, he said.

 However, analysts feel it is too early to reach a conclusion. We will have to wait and watch for a declining trend in the coming weeks, a senior banker said.

 On the demand-supply mismatch of essential goods, Chidambaram said supply could be augmented either by increasing procurement or through imports.

 Payout cut signal from oil retailers

 New Delhi, Jan. 8: Saddled with debt, public sector oil marketing companies will be unable to fork out any special dividends to the government this fiscal. The high cost of imported crude and low prices of end-products have fuelled higher borrowings by oil retailers, putting a severe strain on their financial plans.

 Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has informed the finance ministry that its borrowings have gone up to Rs 26,000 crore in December 2006 from Rs 17,000 crore in April 2005. 

 The cash-starved oil companies have also been selling bonds issued by the government to meet their working capital requirements. They have now decided, in consultation with the government, to offload the remaining oil bonds, worth Rs 8,910 crore, in phases to clear their debts.

 The bonds were issued to IOC, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum to partially compensate them for the under-recoveries in LPG and kerosene which were sold at a discount. 

 The government decided to issue Rs 28,000 crore of interest-bearing bonds to the PSUs in four equal tranches spread across each quarter. 

 Interest-bearing oil bonds are essentially IOU slips from the government which the oil companies can sell at a discount. 

 However, the finance ministry has said that the companies could not offer more than 25 per cent of their original bond subscription in any quarter to prevent destabilisation of the market from a glut in oil bonds. 

 This ruling has forced the oil companies to sell the bonds in multiple tranches.

 Their weak financial health makes them incapable of offering special dividends to the government, which considers the companies as cash cows to be tapped freely to rein in the revenue deficit. 

 IOC liquidated another Rs 985 crore of bonds in the secondary market today through book-building. The bonds were expected to mature in 2015. IOC has now sold bonds worth Rs 5,000 crore in the secondary market this fiscal.

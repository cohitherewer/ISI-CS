 Jet to buy Dreamliner aircraft

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 2: Jet Airways today said it would buy 10 Boeing 787-8 series aircraft to expand its international operations.

 Jet Airways has informed the stock exchanges that to maintain and expand its international operations using wide-body aircraft and to deploy the most modern and economically efficient aircraft, it has executed a purchase agreement with US-based Boeing Company. 

 The acquisition of these aircraft for deliveries between July 2011 and December 2012, will be subject to requisite regulatory approvals. 

 Though Jet Airways did not disclose the value of the deal for the wide-bodied Dreamliner aircraft, it is understood to be in the region of $1.5 billion.

 Under the purchase agreement, Jet Airways also has the option to substitute other models of Boeing aircraft. The airline will begin taking delivery of the B777-300ER and A330-200 aircraft, ordered in September and October 2005 respectively, in March-April 2007.

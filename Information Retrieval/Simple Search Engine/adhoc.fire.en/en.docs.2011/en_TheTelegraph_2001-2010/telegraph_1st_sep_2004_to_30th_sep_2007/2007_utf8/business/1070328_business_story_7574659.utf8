 Calcutta, March 27: EKL Appliances Ltd, formerly Electrolux Kelvinator, is set to become a Rs 1,000-crore company by September 2008.

 The company expects to close its financial calendar of October to September 2007 with a turnover of Rs 700 crore. Its turnover in the previous year was Rs 450 crore. 

 This increase was fuelled by an equitable growth in products across all categories, especially in air conditioners, microwave ovens and frost-free refrigerators. With our new plant set to be operational this year, an increased capacity would help us tap the market better, said Anirudh Dhoot, managing director of EKL Appliances.

 The Uttaranchal factory, set up at an investment of Rs 200 crore, will be operational by August-September.

 Bengal and other regions in the east comprise around 17 per cent of the companys turnover, which is expected to grow in the next two years.

 Electrolux air conditioners, with a market share of 6 per cent in Bengal, are among the top three brands that sell the most. The market share is expected to grow by another 3 per cent in the next fiscal.

 Its national market share for air conditioners is slightly higher at 7.5 per cent and this is is expected to grow by another 2 per cent.

 In July 2005, the Videocon group had acquired a 91.85 per cent stake in Electrolux Kelvinator Limited, a subsidiary of AB Electrolux. 

 In addition to gaining control of EKL Appliances three facilities in India, Videocon, under a separate licence agreement with AB Electrolux, had earned the rights to distribute products under the Electrolux, Kelvinator and Allwyn brands in India and other Saarc countries.

 With the microwave oven market set to reach 1 million units during 2007-08, the company plans to leverage its 27 per cent market share in Bengal in microwave ovens to gain a stronger foothold.

 Nationally, its market share in microwave ovens is 13 per cent.

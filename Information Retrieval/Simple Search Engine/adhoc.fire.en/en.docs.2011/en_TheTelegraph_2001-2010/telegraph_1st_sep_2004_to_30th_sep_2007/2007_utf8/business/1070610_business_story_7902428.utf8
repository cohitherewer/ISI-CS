 New Delhi, June 9: General Motors India plans to sell 70,000 units this year.

 We have been able to achieve a robust growth rate despite a slowdown in the industry. This year we are looking to sell about 66,000 units compared with 38,800 last year, said Anisha Motwani, director (marketing) of GM India.

 Motwani was speaking at the launch of GMs first diesel sedan Optra Magnum. About 8,000 units are expected to be sold in the Optra range, 70 per cent of which will be in the diesel version. Aveo, Aveo-UVA and Chevrolet SRV together will make up for another 16,000 units, she said.

 The diesel passenger car market is expected to go up by 30 to 35 per cent by 2010, said Ankush Arora, vice-president, marketing (sales and after sales), GM India. Arora added that a petrol version of the Optra sedan will be launched soon.

 Buoyed by the response to its hatchback Chevrolet Spark, the company aims to sell 18,000 units of the car and 24,000 units of multi-utility vehicle Tavera in 2007.

 An entry into the small car segment is expected to help the US-based automobile company gain significant market share in India. GM had only a 2.8 per cent market share till March. It hopes to increase this to 10 per cent by 2010.

 The Optra Magnum is powered by a two-litre turbo-charged common rail direct injection engine. Its price will range between Rs 8.74 lakh and Rs 9.99 lakh. It will be pitched against the Skoda Octavia (Rs 11.34 lakh) and the Toyota Corolla (Rs 9.07 lakh).

 In May, GM India posted a 95 per cent jump in sales at 3,625 units against 1,853 units in the same month a year ago, making it the fifth-largest car manufacturer in the country.

 Arora said the company was also planning to launch the SUV Captiva next year. It is also exploring the possibilities of introducing the CNG range in mid-sized sedan Aveo. GM has already introduced CNG Optra in the market.

 The company is setting up a greenfield plant near Pune at an investment of Rs 1,300 crore. The unit would go on stream during the last quarter of 2008 and will have a capacity of 1.4 lakh units per annum. The capacity at its Halol plant in Gujarat has also been increased to 85,000 units per annum from 60,000 units.

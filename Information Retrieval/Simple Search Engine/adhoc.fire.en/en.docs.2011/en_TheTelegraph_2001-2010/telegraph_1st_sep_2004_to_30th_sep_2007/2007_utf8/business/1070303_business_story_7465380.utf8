 FIPB seeks details on Hutch buy

 New Delhi, March 2 (PTI): The Foreign Investment Promotion Board is believed to have asked Hong Kongs Hutchison Telecom International Ltd (HTIL) for details about the 15 per cent stake held by minority shareholders Asim Ghosh and Analjit Singh in Hutch Essar.

 The FIPB has also sought details from Bharti Airtel regarding Vodafones stake in the company, sources said.

 However, Hutchison Telecom International, late in the night, said the FIPB has not sought any details from the company regarding its sale of the 67 per cent stake in Hutchison Essar to Vodafone.

 It is a matter we cannot comment as FIPB is not writing to Hutchison Telecom but to the independent shareholders of Hutchison Essar, an HTIL spokesperson said from Hong Kong.

 Last month, Vodafone and Bharti announced an agreement under which Bharti agreed to buy back a 5.6 per cent direct stake from Vodafone for $1.6 billion, while the UK mobile giant retained the balance indirect equity in the group.

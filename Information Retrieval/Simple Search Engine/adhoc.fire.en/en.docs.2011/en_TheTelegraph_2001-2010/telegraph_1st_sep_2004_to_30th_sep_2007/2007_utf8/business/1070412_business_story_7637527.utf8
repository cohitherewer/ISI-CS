 IMF warns of growth slowdown

 Washington, April 11 (PTI): With the world economy predicted to slow down this year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has forecast a 7.8 per cent growth rate for the Indian economy in 2008.

 Emerging markets and developing countries are expected to continue to grow strongly, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than in 2006, IMF said in its World Economic Outlook report today.

 Indias economic growth would slow down to 8.4 per cent in 2007 and even further to 7.8 per cent by the next year, against 9.2 per cent in 2006, as there was still room for interest rate hikes to contain inflation, the Fund said.

 According to the report, higher revenues are expected to reduce the percentage of revenues to gross domestic product (GDP) by 1 basis point to 6.3 per cent of the GDP.

 In India, inflationary pressures and rapid credit growth have prompted the Reserve Bank of India to raise policy rates and the cash reserve requirement of banks.

 With inflationary pressures still strong, some further tightening is likely to be needed, the Fund said.

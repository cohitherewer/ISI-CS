 Reforms key to pension growth

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, April 8: Pension reforms in India are likely to help the segment grow to a Rs 4-lakh-crore market by 2025. This was revealed in a joint study by Ficci and KPMG. 

 However, if there are no reforms, the market may grow at a slower rate and its size may be just around Rs 180,800 crore.

 However, according to industry estimates, the market, which was worth Rs 63,000 crore in 2006, is likely to touch Rs 84,000 crore this year, a growth of nearly 33 per cent. 

 The overall economic gain will be substantial as the mobilisation of assets will lead to effective investments in stock, bond and mortgage markets, thus supplying the capital to finance corporate growth, government infrastructure and housing through market choice, said the study. 

 Indias need for pension reforms arises from various concerns about the existing pension provisions. These include a skewed coverage with only about 10 per cent of the countrys labour force being covered by government sponsored or mandated schemes and the dichotomy between the benefits available under the two schemes.

 The study said reforms in the pension sector will inflate the capital markets and will require advanced management techniques to manage the extra inflow of funds.

 This will include leveraging technology to provide information to individual pensioners on their asset allocation. This will create an interest for individuals and create accountability on the part of the fund managers, said the study.

 At present, there are few investment avenues for pension funds in India because of the relatively undeveloped pension sector. A solution could be to invest a part of the pension funds in the international markets. This will also diversify portfolio risk and earn higher returns. 

 The Ficci-KPMG paper said any new system would hinge on a few key parameters for its efficient functioning. For a pension system to be sustainable, the regulator will have to contribute to the development wherein it would enforce present regulations and enact new ones if necessary. 

 It would also require a strong regulatory framework for the legal, financial and administrative matters. The paper noted that a strong and stable pension system has a positive impact on capital markets.

 The advantages include development of alternative investment avenues, better financial regulation, better consumer protection, pension fund regulation, market stability and modernisation of trading and record keeping systems, and increased role in corporate governance.

 Assocham proposal

 Assocham has urged the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to treat financial institutions (FIs) nominees as independent directors (IDs).

 With the experience in and exposure to like situations in industry, nominee directors of FIs, who generally hold good academic record and professional qualifications, merit better consideration for treatment as IDs than many other contenders, Assocham said in a representation to Sebi.

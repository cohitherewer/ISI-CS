 IFC to infuse $67m in Max Health

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 10: The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector investment arm of the World Bank group, will invest $67.2 million (about Rs 300 crore) in Max Healthcare Institute Ltd. 

 This will help the healthcare service provider expand its operations in the country.

 IFCs investment will comprise two parts Rs 50 crore ($11.2 million) in common equity of Max Healthcare and Rs 250 crore ($56 million) in preferred-cum-redeemable equity.

 Max Healthcare plans to set up a 100-bed hospital in Dehradun and an 84-bed hospital at Saket in New Delhi. The company also plans to add 268 beds to its existing 752-bed hospital at Patparganj in New Delhi.

 Max Healthcare is proud to partner with IFC. This partnership recognises our efforts to establish benchmarks of medical excellence and outstanding quality of service. IFCs investment will help us realise our vision of emerging as a leading healthcare service provider in the country, said Analjit Singh, chairman of Max India Limited.

 Max Healthcare is a subsidiary of Max India. 

 Max Healthcare operates on a hub-and-spoke model, with two tertiary care hospitals as the hub and primary and secondary care hospitals, as well as diagnostics and laboratory centres as the spokes, enabling patients to transit from one care provider to another. 

 The companys two tertiary care hospitals specialise in cardiac care, neurology, orthopaedics and joint replacements, paediatrics, obstetrics, and gynaecology.

 According to the World Health Organisation and the Confederation of Indian Industry, the demand for high-quality healthcare services is increasing in the country on the back of an increase in per capita income. 

 The private sector has a critical role to support this growing demand in the country.

 The healthcare sector will require private investment of $34 billion by 2012. 

 Investments will be required to set up medical colleges, nursing and hospital management schools, besides hospitals. 

 As of June 2006, IFC had an investment portfolio of $1.3 billion in India. 

 The financial institution focuses on supporting private sector development through direct investment and advisory services. 

 Last financial year, IFC committed over $400 million in new investments in India.

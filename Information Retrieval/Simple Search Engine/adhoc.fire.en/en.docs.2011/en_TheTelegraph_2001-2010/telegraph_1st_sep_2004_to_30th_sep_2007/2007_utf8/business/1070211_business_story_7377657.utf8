 Govt roadmap for Northeast

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Aiyar: Looking east

 Calcutta, Feb. 10: The Centre plans to spend Rs 50,000 crore to develop road infrastructure in the Northeast in the next five years.

 The amount would be funded through agencies such as the Non-Lapsable Central Pool of Resources (NLCPR), the ministry of development of northeastern region (DONER) and schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana.

 Panchayati Raj minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said the fund would be subject to the capacity of the states to absorb the amount, given the inadequate infrastructure and poor human resources in the region. 

 Around four-fifth of the fund will be used to develop the national and state highways but DONER will ensure that the remaining amount is used to build a network of district, staff and village roads, Aiyar said. 

 He was speaking at a seminar organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce on the Northeast.

 Central Bank strike

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 23: Employees of the Central Bank of India have called a one-day strike tomorrow to protest against the banks initial public offering. The IPO opens for subscription tomorrow. The issue closes on July 27.

 The strike has been called by two of the employee organisations the All India Central Bank Officers Association and All India Central Bank Employees Federation.

 Sources said the bank had failed to recover its debts and the unions feared that the IPO could lead to the privatisation of the bank. They said the non-performing assets of the bank stood at Rs 2,572 crore on March 31. If even 5 per cent of the amount was recovered, there would have been no need for the bank to dilute its equity capital, the official added.

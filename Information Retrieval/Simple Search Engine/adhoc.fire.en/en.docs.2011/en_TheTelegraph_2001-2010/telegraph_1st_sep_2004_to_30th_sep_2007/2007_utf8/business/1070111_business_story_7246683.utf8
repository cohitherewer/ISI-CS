 Alcoa puts up a poor show in fourth quarter

 New York, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Alcoa Inc, the worlds biggest aluminium producer, has posted a decline in its fourth-quarter profit. The result comes on the back of lower production due to hurricanes, strikes and restructuring costs.

 The company said it was still affected by higher-than-expected costs for raw materials and energy, although it does not see substantial price spikes in 2006. Shares of the first Dow Industrials company to report in the earnings season fell sharply after-hours, dampening some market euphoria on a day when the Dow closed above 11,000 for the first time since 2001.

 Are we satisfied? The answer is no, chairman and chief executive officer Alain Belda told analysts in a conference call. But I cannot minimise our accomplishments in 2005, he added, referring to restructuring and cost-cutting plans put into effect. 

 Belda said Alcoa had anticipated input costs raw materials and energy would rise approximately $600 million in 2005. They, however, ended up at $747 million over the previous year. 

 Asked if costs would continue to skyrocket, Belda said: In 2006, we will battle some of the same pressures but there is a feeling that unless there is a big change in oil prices, majority of the pressure is under control and the actions we have taken should result in an improvement over 2005. 

 Caustic soda, a key ingredient in aluminum production, was expected to cost $50 million more this year, he said. Looking back over the fourth quarter, he said productivity was not as strong as was expected. There were problems with maintenance and labour at an Australian facility and a change of bauxite mine in Surinam affected the quality of the ore, which is smelted into alumina -- the raw material for aluminum. 

 Moreover, hurricanes Katrina and Rita affected operations in Jamaica and Texas, he said. But the industry outlook is very bright in terms of fundamentals, with (aluminum) prices at their highest in 17 years, Belda said.

 The global aluminum industry industry is expected to double in the next 15 years, he said, with Asia accounting for 60 per cent of the growth. In its earnings release, the Pittsburgh-based company said net earnings were $224 million, or 26 cents per share, compared to $268 million, or 30 cents, in the same quarter last year. 

 Earnings from continuing operations were $210 million or 24 cents per share. Analysts were expecting earnings of 38 cents per share. Profitability was cut by $93 million, or 11 cents per share, the company said, by factors including lowered production at refineries in Jamaica and Texas due to the hurricanes.

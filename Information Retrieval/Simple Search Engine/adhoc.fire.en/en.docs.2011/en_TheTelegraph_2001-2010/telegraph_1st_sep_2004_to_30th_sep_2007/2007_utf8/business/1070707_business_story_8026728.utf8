The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 PNB puts AllBank tieup plans in slow lane

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 6: Punjab National Bank (PNB) will go slow on the joint venture with Allahabad Bank to float a subsidiary for opening a branch in Kazakhstan.

 The announcement for the joint venture was made in 2004.

 We have to carefully evaluate options. No feasibility and profitability studies have been done, said K.C. Chakrabarty, chairman and managing director of Punjab National Bank.

 To open an overseas branch, regulatory issues of both the countries have to be closely examined.

 PNB is all set to enter the credit card business next year.

 The bank will not be able to start life insurance business by this year, Chakrabarty had earlier said.

 The focus will be on inclusive banking and educational loans.

 Chakrabarty said rural banking faced problems such as timely availability of services and access to credit.

 There are schemes such as the no-frills account, PNB Mitra. 

 There are 2.18 lakh account holders under this scheme with a deposit value of Rs 10.28 crore.

 The PNB family linkage programme has identified 2,609 villages and 4.61 lakh families, of which 2.8 lakh have already been covered.

 The bank expects its deposits to grow 18-19 per cent. This is on a par with the deposit growth for the industry. Rise in advances is seen to be around 21 per cent.

 The industry is talking about consolidation when 60 per cent of the population do not have a bank account, 80 per cent do not have access to insurance products and 98 per have no access to capital market products, said Chakrabarty. 

 PNB will strive to create awareness about financial inclusion, he added.

 PNB feels consolidation will be more relevant once people are more aware of financial inclusion.

 PNB will require capital worth Rs 4,000 crore in the next two years and look at raising funds through tier I and tier II instruments.

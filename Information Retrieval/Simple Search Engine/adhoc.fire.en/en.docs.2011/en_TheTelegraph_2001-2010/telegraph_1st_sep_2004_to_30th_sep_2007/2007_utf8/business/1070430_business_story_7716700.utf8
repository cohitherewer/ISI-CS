 New Delhi, April 29: Companies are banking on innovation to stay ahead of competition. This was revealed in a joint survey conducted on 60 companies by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

 Eighty-nine per cent of the respondents said the importance of innovation had increased significantly over the past 10 years.

 While 39 per cent of the respondents considered innovation critical to their organisations, 7 per cent said its significance had increased marginally and 4 per cent found no difference in its importance.

 For 91 per cent of the respondents, innovation was among the top three strategic focus.

 The survey revealed that senior management was in favour of creating an environment for innovation. However, they perceive a gap between desire and their ability to manage innovation. 

 According to the survey, companies are realising the importance of innovation in human resources, customer care, business strategy and core operations. After the focus on quality in the 1980s and 1990s, the manufacturing companies are now laying stress on front-end innovation to deliver double-digit growth. 

 They are working on better consumer services and product cost structures. They are gearing up to offer more features in their products rather than focusing just on process management and quality. A lot is being done in the human resource segment as well to draw and retain talent.

 The survey also stated that companies are confronting the innovation paradox. While 74 per cent of the respondents plan to substantially increase future investments in innovation, around 60 per cent did not get the desired returns.

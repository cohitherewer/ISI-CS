 JSW Steel sniffs foreign acquisitions

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Looking forward

 Calcutta, Jan. 28: The Tatas bid for Corus has encouraged other domestic steel companies to explore acquisition opportunities abroad.

 The latest to join the bandwagon is JSW Steel, which is scouting for targets in developed markets.

 To facilitate its overseas ambitions, the Sajjan Jindal-controlled company has set up two subsidiaries.

 The company has incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary called JSW Steel (UK) Ltd in London to identify and speed up acquisitions in steel.

 Market sources said the company has identified a UK-based unit offering customised steel products to the white goods and automobile industry.

 The Indian firm is close to acquiring this service centre, which will be the stepping stone for JSW in Europe, sources added. JSW Steel has also incorporated JSW Natural Resources Ltd in Mauritius to acquire coal mines abroad.

 Bengal plan

 JSW Steel has set up a subsidiary for its 10-million-tonne Bengal steel plant.

 It will hold an 89 per cent stake in the subsidiary, while the rest will be owned by two Bengal government undertakings West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation and West Bengal Mineral Development and Trading Corporation Limited.

 Initially, the new company will have an authorised and a paid-up equity capital of Rs 100 crore. 

 The 3-million-tonne first phase of the project will be completed in four years.

 The cost of the steel plant, assuming the power plant and oxygen unit will be implemented by other associate companies with independent financing arrangements, is estimated to be Rs 6,000 crore. It will be financed by an equity of Rs 2,000 crore and a debt of Rs 4,000 crore.

 The debt is proposed to be raised by the joint venture company without recourse to JSW Steel. 

 The equity of Rs 2,000 crore will be held to the extent of 51 per cent by JSW Steel and the balance will be contributed by WBIDC/WBMDTC and group investment/associate companies.

 The company proposes to achieve the financial closure of the first phase in the joint venture with JSW Steel contributing around Rs 1,000 crore. It expects to meet this contribution through its cash accruals.

 Chennai, March 29: German car manufacturer BMW today inaugurated its first plant in the country. The company hopes to sell 1,200 cars in India this fiscal and will open 12 dealerships by 2009 the year it hopes to launch its popular mini car.

 The Chennai plant will initially manufacture the companys 3 Series range, while production for the 5 Series will begin in May. The price of the 3 Series will range between Rs 26.7 lakh and Rs 32 lakh and the 5 Series will be priced between Rs 37 lakh and Rs 42 lakh.

 The 3 Series comprises the entry-level 320i (petrol), the 320 D (diesel) and the 325i (petrol) variants. The strategy of local production will allow us to exploit the opportunities available for opening up and exploiting markets with long-term potential for growth, said Frank Peter Arndt, production director of BMW AG. 

 The Chennai facility has an overall production capacity of 1,700 units. Arndt said 90 per cent of BMWs total sales in India would come from the Chennai facility, while the balance 10 per cent would be imported from Germany. Of this 90 per cent, the 3 Series would contribute nearly 50 per cent, said a senior company official. 

 The import models include the BMW X3 Series, X5, 6 Series and 7 Series. Last year, the company sold a total of 257 units. The Chennai plant is the fifth plant in Asia after China, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. 

 The company has invested over 20 million euros in India. The money has been invested in setting up the Chennai facility and its warehouse in Mumbai for spare part distribution from a rented facility. 

 Norbert Reithofer, chairman of the executive board of BMW AG, said: The importance of Asia in our strategic consideration has been increasing over the last few years. This is where we expect the most dynamic economic growth in the long-term. India offers big opportunities for growth. Opening this plant represents our long-term route to profitable growth.

 The BMW group has been selling cars in India over the last 10 years through its dealers.

 The gellardo superleggera is being sold for 1,26,800 euros (about rs 76,08,000) in the european markets, but would be costlier in india as the country imposes massive customs duty on foreign cars.

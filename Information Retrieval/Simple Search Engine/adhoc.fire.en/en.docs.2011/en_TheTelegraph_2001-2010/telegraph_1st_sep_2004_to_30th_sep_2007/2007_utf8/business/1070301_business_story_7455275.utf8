 Study cess drives up car prices

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: Car manufacturers have decided to increase prices across the board as finance minister P. Chidambaram today slapped an additional one per cent education cess.

 The countrys largest car manufacturing company, Maruti Udyog Limited (MUL), was the quickest to take a decision to this effect. While others like General Motors, Hyundai Motors India and Ford are reviewing the situation and are likely to soon follow suit.

 The hike in car prices, on account of the cess, will come into effect on March 15, said MUL in an official release issued today. The car company however said as a gesture to customers who might have deferred purchases owing to the budget, it has not decided to immediately hike prices.

 Car companies over the last few months have already been increasing prices on account of a hike in steel prices and other essential inputs. The automobile industry is of the view that an additional one per cent cess in the absence of any other sop or incentive may affect the bottomlines of the companies.

 Rajeev Chaba, president and managing director, General Motors India, told The Telegraph the budget has largely not met the demand of the industry. On top of it, a 1 per cent cess has been imposed. Companies will have to pass on the burden. In our case, there could be an increase in the region of Rs 1,000 crore across vehicles. 

 Amongst other manufacturers, Ford India also said it will review the impact on prices in light of the budget.

 We will consider an increase in the prices of our models Fiesta and Ikon that have high local content. We would need to study the impact of customs duty reduction on the price of the Endeavour, said a company official.

 Korean car major and Hyundai Motors India will also review prices. Arvind Saxena, vice-president, marketing and sales, HMIL said, We are studying the fine print and in a day or two, we will take a decision. The price hike will however be very small.

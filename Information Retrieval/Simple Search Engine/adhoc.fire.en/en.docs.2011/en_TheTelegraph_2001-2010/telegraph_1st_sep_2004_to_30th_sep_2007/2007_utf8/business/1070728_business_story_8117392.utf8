 FIIs keep faith in growth story

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 27: They have pumped a net investment of around $5 billion this month into Indian equities, nearly half of what they shovelled in all of 2006-07. 

 All eyes are, therefore, now on foreign institutional investors (FIIs) to try and second guess their moves.

 However, after a gut-wrenching 541.74-point fall in the sensex, the opinion among a large set of market participants is that foreign investors are unlikely to scoop up their gains and scoot even though the furrow lines have deepened over high valuations. 

 Analysts reckon that the strong earnings growth by India Inc will ensure that these investors stay on in the country. 

 FIIs have largely been net buyers during this month and recent studies, showing India among the least favoured destinations in straw polls of global fund managers, havent deterred actual fund flows.

 Dhiraj Sachdev, vice-president of HSBC Asset Management, feels FII interest continues to remain strong, evident from their purchases this month. FIIs have been net investors for most of this month. 

 Data available from the Securities and Exchange Board of India shows foreign investors to have largely been buyers, barring one session where they were net sellers. 

 Most of them (FIIs) are here for the long haul. We may see some of them booking profits in the short term, but they are unlikely to exit in a hurry. We may soon find that the Indian markets will have a de-correlation to the US markets as there are a lot of investment ideas here and money will flow to Asian markets excluding Japan, Sachdev adds. 

 Dinesh Thakkar, chairman and managing director of Angel Broking, says the strong earnings growth by domestic companies will keep the foreign investors in India. While Indian stock markets will not correct significantly, with India Inc expected to show a 15 to 16 per cent earnings growth for the next few years, any change in global liquidity scenario will lead to a knee-jerk reaction in our markets, he said.

 Thakkar says FIIs currently hold 20 per cent of the overall Indian stock market capitalisation of Rs 44.4 trillion. The only worry is high valuations that have prompted some analysts to warn of a pullback. 

 Many of them appear over-valued and, therefore, foreign investors could book profits, at least in the short term. However, they could re-enter later, an analyst with a domestic brokerage said.

 Bancrofts accept News deal

 FLYING HIGH

 New York, July 31 (Reuters): Rupert Murdochs News Corp is expected to reach a definitive agreement to buy Dow Jones soon, capping his three-month pursuit of the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, a source familiar with the matter said.

 Dow Jones shares rose nearly 12 per cent in anticipation of the deal.

 The Bancroft family has accepted, John Prestbo, editor and executive director of Dow Jones Indexes, told reporters in Chicago. He said Dow Jones will be part of News Corp. Prestbo said the information came from an internal company memo.

 The Bancrofts own 64 per cent of Dow Jones voting stock and have been deliberating over whether to accept Murdochs $60-per-share bid, first announced in early May.

 As of late Monday, Bancrofts, holding about 29 per cent of Dow Jones voting stock, had voted in favour of the deal, according to The Wall Street Journal.

 News Corps board of directors is expected to discuss the deal later today, one source said. The Dow Jones board is also expected to meet today, another source familiar with the discussions said.

 Dow Jones is discussing a plan to have News Corp cover the legal fees incurred by the Bancroft family, amounting to at least $30 million, the Journal reported on Monday.

 After all the high-minded concerns about editorial interest and journalistic excellence, it gets down to who pays the legal fees for the Bancrofts, Benchmark amp; Co analyst Ed Atorino said. 

 And some of the trustees bailed, fearing theyd get sued by some of the younger trust beneficiaries if they voted against the deal so much for principles, Atorino added.

 Some members of the Bancroft family had said they opposed Murdochs bid because they believed he would interfere with Dow Jones news operations, while others were seeking an even richer premium than the 65 per cent premium News Corp offered. 

 On Monday, a News Corp spokesman said it was highly unlikely to proceed with the offer unless more than a reported 28 per cent of the voting shares owned by the Bancroft family supported the deal.

 News Corp and a representative for the Bancroft family declined comment. Dow Jones was not immediately reachable. Dow Jones shares were up $5.90 at $57.46 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They reached as high as $57.50 earlier.

 The definitive agreement has not been signed, but people familiar with the situation tell me it will be this evening, a CNBC newscaster reported on Tuesday.

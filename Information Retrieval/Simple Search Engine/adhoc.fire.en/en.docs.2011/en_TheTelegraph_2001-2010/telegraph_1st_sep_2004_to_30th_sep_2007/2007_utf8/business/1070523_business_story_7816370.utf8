 Coke move to open Glaceau bottle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 22: Coca-Cola Company is not giving up on its quest for Glaceau, the US-based vitamin water maker in which the Tata group holds a 30 per cent stake. 

 The beverage giant took a major step by submitting a pre-merger filing with the US anti-trust regulators expressing its desire to acquire Glaceau.

 A trade publication Beverage Digest reported that Coke has filed a pre-merger Hart-Scott-Rodino Act notification with the US federal trade commission (FTC). Such a filing is necessary for major deals under the US anti-trust regulatory framework, which seeks to prevent merger and acquisitions that could reduce competition or lead to higher prices and lower quality of goods or services.

 Citing unnamed sources, Beverage Digest said the filing triggers a review of any possible anti-trust implications of the proposed deal. It is believed that some significant developments may have occurred that have led to such a filing and Coke may have either come closer to an agreement to acquire Glaceau or it would have filed a non-binding letter of intent for the deal. 

 The report added that the FTC only begins its review process when the major deal points are agreed upon though a deal is still subject to a green signal from the board of Coca-Cola Company. Though it was not known when Coke filed the notification with the FTC, a review process normally takes 30 days.

 Coke officials, however, refrained from making any comments. Dan A. Schafer, vice-president, North America Communications, told The Telegraph from the companys headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, that the company did not comment on market speculation. A spokesperson from Tata Tea also declined to comment.

 Last August, the Tata group had acquired a 30 per cent stake in Glaceau for $677 million (Rs 3,150 crore) that valued the company at over $2.2 billion. Tata Sons, the holding company of the group, and Tata Tea jointly acquired this stake from TSG, a private equity firm. 

 Since the share acquisition, the valuation of Glaceau has climbed. Reports now state that the company is valued at at least $3 billion, a 36 per cent jump in less than 10 months.

 It is this surge in valuation that has prompted the stock markets here to speculate that the Tatas will look to cash out of Glaceau. 

 News that Coca-Cola has made a filing with the FTC today drove up the Tata Tea stock. On the BSE, it ended higher by 4.43 per cent or Rs 37.25 to finish at Rs 877.55.

 Sources close to the group said they were unlikely to give up their stake in Glaceau in a hurry. Senior officials from the group have indicated in the past that the company has made the right decision in picking up a stake in Glaceau and that there are huge advantages from the deal. So it is unlikely that the group will cash out, the sources said.

 Glaceau provided the Tatas a good platform for the global growth of its beverage business. Glaceau has an extensive distribution network in the US. While 50 per cent of the company is being held by its promoters, friends and associates, the balance 20 per cent is held through a number of venture capital funds. When they bought into Glaceau, the Tatas were also given the option to buy another 10 per cent stake in the company.

 Formed in 1996, Glaceau, makes energy drinks called as enhanced water category.

 Greyhound changes hands

 London, Feb. 9 (Reuters): Britains biggest bus company FirstGroup Plc said on Friday it had agreed to buy Laidlaw International Inc, the US operator of iconic intercity Greyhound buses, for $3.6 billion, including debt. 

 FirstGroup said it would pay $35.25 for each Laidlaw share, an 11 per cent premium to Thursdays closing price, in a deal that will also make it the largest operator of yellow school buses in the US.

 It will pay for the deal in part with a placing of shares to raise 200 million ($393 million), it said in a statement.

 FirstGroups acquisition of Laidlaw will considerably enhance the groups existing activities in North America, which themselves have grown strongly since we first invested in the US in 1999, FirstGroup chief executive Moir Lockhead said.

 At 0805 GMT, FirstGroup shares were down 0.3 per cent at 559-1/2 pence, valuing the firm at about 2.2 billion.

 FirstGroup is already one of the biggest operators of student buses in the US after it bought Ryder Public Transportation Services in 1999 for $940 million, and the Financial Times and Daily Telegraph newspapers warned this latest deal could attract scrutiny from competition authorities.

 The Financial Times also said the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents many school bus drivers, had vowed to oppose the deal.

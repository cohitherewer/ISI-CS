 Tata meet on Corus funding

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 10: The board of Tata Steel will meet on April 17 to discuss plans for funding the acquisition of Anglo-Dutch firm Corus Group Plc. One of the options that the steel company may consider is an overseas flotation in the form of global depository receipts (GDRs).

 In a notice to stock exchanges, Tata Steel said the directors would consider possible proposals to raise equity as part of its long-term fund raising exercise to finance the companys investment in the special purpose vehicle (SPV) to acquire the Corus Group. Tata Steel did not provide details on the funding options that it would look at though there was a buzz that a GDR issue could be a possibility.

 Company officials, however, did not comment in view of the board meeting.

 On January 31, the Tatas won the battle for Corus as it outbid Brazils Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) with a bid of 608 pence a share after a nine-round auction. While the winning bid of $11.3 billion entailed a higher amount than originally planned, the Tata group had indicated that it would not over-leverage itself when it came to funding the deal. The company had then said additional finance required under the proposed terms of the revised acquisition would be funded through a combination of additional credit facilities and a cash contribution by Tata Steel to Tata Steel UK.

 Tata Steel and Tata Sons are expected to contribute $4.1 billion in equity to Tata Steel UK through which the acquisition will be routed. While this would mean a debt-equity ratio of 2:1 or a debt of around $8 billion, reports said Credit Suisse would fund 45 per cent of the debt component with the remaining coming from ABN Amro and Deutsche Bank.

 While Tata Steel UK had acquired 7,136,094 shares of Corus at 601.75 pence apiece on February 14, the purchase led to the subsidiary holding close to 22 per cent of the Corus equity. Earlier this month, Tata Steel had announced that it had completed the acquisition of Corus.

 The announcement came after High Court of Justice in England and Wales passed an order sanctioning the Scheme of Arrangement relating to the recommended offer for the acquisition of Corus by the company through Tata Steel UK at a price of 608 pence per share in cash and Corus shareholders gave their consent at the court meeting and the extraordinary general meeting, which were held on March 7.

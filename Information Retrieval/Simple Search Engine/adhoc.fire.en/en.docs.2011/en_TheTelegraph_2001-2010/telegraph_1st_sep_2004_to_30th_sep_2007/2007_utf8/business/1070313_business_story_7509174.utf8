 Mumbai, March 12: Reliance Industries today announced fresh gas discoveries in its oil blocks in Krishna-Godavari and Mahanadi basins. The company has informed the directorate general of hydrocarbons of the two discoveries.

 In the Krishna-Godavari basin, the company found two-gas bearing zones in oil block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6. The gas was found in the well marked KG-D6-P2 in the block. The discovery, called Dhirubhai 31, is the 17th in the block. The exploratory well was the 22nd in KG-D6 and 46th overall of the company. 

 The company also confirmed the presence of hydrocarbons at its oil block NEC OSN 97/2 or NEC 25 in the Mahanadi basin. The discovery Dhirubhai 32 made in the well NEC 25-A5 was the seventh in the Mahanadi basin. It was the 47th exploratory well of the company.

 Reliance said it is now evaluating the commercial potential of the two discoveries. 

 RIL had recently announced that it plans to double production to 80 million metric standard cubic metre per day (mmscmd) in the KG block at an investment of $5.2 billion. The company wants to develop the block by 2008-09 and start commercial production from 2009-10.

 Reliance, which won the block in the Nelp 1 bidding holds 90 per cent of the participating interest of the block as its operator, while Niko Resources has 10 per cent. 

 Meanwhile, brokerages are upbeat on Reliances prospects after the spate of discoveries in recent months. Edelweiss, while upgrading the stock to buy, said in a report that the companys track record makes it capable of producing a higher output of 120 mmscmd from the block. 

 Edelweiss also predicts operating cash flows in excess of $ 4 billion per year in 2009-10, the first year of full E amp;P operations. 

 The brokerage predicts full firm operating cash flows in excess of $ 6 billion in 2009-10.

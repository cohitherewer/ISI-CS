The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Stage set for rate reshuffle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 19: The writing is on the wall: Its almost certain that Reserve Bank of India governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy will raise interest rates at the end of this month.

 With headline inflation hitting a two-year high and the economy not showing any signs of cooling down, bankers say Reddy can raise the reverse repo by another 25 basis points to head off the prospect of spiralling inflation.

 The central bank is due to review the monetary policy on January 31. A rate tweak by Reddy could prompt banks to revise their interest rate tables. 

 The reverse repo the rate signalling device has been raised thrice in 2006: In January, June and July. The reverse repo is the rate at which the RBI mops up surplus funds from the system. It now stands at 6 per cent. On the other hand, the repo rate (the rate at which the RBI lends funds to banks) is now at 7.25 per cent. The RBI raised the repo rate in October. 

 Bankers are not ruling out the possibility of another increase in both deposit and lending rates over the next few weeks by quarter of a percentage point.

 The wholesale price index today rose to 6.12 per cent for the week ended January 6 due to some expensive food products and fuel items. It is thus way above the range of 5.0 to 5.5 per cent projected by the RBI for the current year. 

 However, observers who track the inflation numbers are not surprised. The markets were expecting headline inflation to be around 6.10 per cent for the week.

 I am not surprised, I had expected inflation for the week to be at 6.07 per cent, says Indranil Pan, chief economist, Kotak Mahindra Bank.

 Pan, like many others in the banking community, is of the view that the central bank will again raise the reverse repo rate by quarter of a percentage point. 

 After the surprise repo rate rise in October, last month Reddy raised the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by half a percentage point to 5.5 per cent. CRR is that portion of banks deposits which must be compulsorily maintained with the RBI.

 After such measures, the markets were divided on whether Reddy would choose to raise rates this month. However, with headline inflation remaining firm and bank advances continuing to grow at a robust pace, bankers are now coming round to the view that a rate rise is now inevitable.

 Pan said there were no signs that global inflation would ease up. At home, credit growth has been robust and manufactured product prices have been climbing all of which has created an interesting backdrop that could compel Reddy to act.

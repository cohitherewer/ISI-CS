 Calcutta, July 11: The Merchants Chamber of Commerce will focus on three areas farm income and agricultural production; micro, small and medium enterprises; and domestic trade.

 The chamber plans to organise workshops and seminars to raise awareness in these areas and recommend improvement measures to the government.

 We, in association with the Assocham and the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, had conducted a study on internal trade which was presented to the Centre as well as the state government three years ago. We are yet to get a response, said Atul Churiwal, president, Merchants Chamber of Commerce.

 The chamber wants a short-term policy to improve the logistics and supply chain and import commodities in short supply at reasonable costs. It feels availability of credit and regulatory framework pose problems for domestic trade.

 We feel there should be a dedicated department or ministry for domestic trade and a state counterpart, which would coordinate on policy issues, Churiwal added. The chamber will also encourage its members to participate in the SME sector through a cluster-based public-private partnership model. The chamber also lauded the recent government schemes for SMEs.

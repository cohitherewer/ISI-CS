 Plastics unit hurts GE Industrial numbers

 Boston, Jan. 20 (Reuters): General Electric said on Friday that fourth-quarter profit rose at all units except for GE Industrial, which was hurt by poor plastics performance. 

 The conglomerate, whose operations range from jet engines to commercial lending, said it may put the plastics unit up for sale and that it had overstated past earnings dating back to 2001 by $343 million as a result of flawed accounting for interest rate swaps. 

 For months, investors have been wondering when GE would move to divest its plastics business. Fourth quarter net income totalled $6.58 billion, or 64 cents per share, compared with $3.16 billion, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings were in line with the forecasts of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. 

 GE, the worlds second-largest company by market capitalisation after Exxon Mobil Corp, said its revenue rose 11 per cent to $44.62 billion. Profit at the industrial unit, which in addition to plastics makes products such as light bulbs and appliances, fell 12 per cent to $673 million. 

 Were seeing exactly why the company made a decision to divest the plastic unit, because the industrial performance is just not good, said Peter Smith, an analyst at Morningstar. That just serves as an evidence why the company has been so active in the (mergers and acquisitions) market.

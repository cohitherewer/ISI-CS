 Hope on pipeline, not duty

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Awaiting relief

 New Delhi, Feb. 11: While oil and gas pipelines are expected to get infrastructure status in the budget, the finance ministry does not appear to be too keen for a restructuring of duties on petroleum products. The oil companies have been clamouring for such a recast. 

 Infrastructure status to pipelines will bring them under the purview of Section 80 1A of the Income Tax Act, which allows for a 10-year tax holiday for investment in these projects. 

 The concession will come as a boon to companies such as Reliance Industries and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation that are planning to lay long-distance pipelines from their gas fields. ONGC and GAIL India will also benefit.

 GAIL has chalked out a plan to lay a national gas grid, and the tax holiday will lower the cost of its projects. ONGC has also drawn up plans to lay the Uran-Trombay pipeline, which is scheduled for completion in May 2008.

 Downstream companies, such as Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum, will gain if the concession is extended to crude oil and product pipelines. These companies are expanding their pipeline networks, which is a more efficient way of transporting products than by road or rail. Similarly, ONGC and Cairn Energy have to lay a costly pipeline to evacuate the waxy crude from the Rajasthan oil finds.

 The petroleum ministry has asked the finance ministry to reduce the excise duty on diesel to eventually bring it on a par with kerosene and LPG. The government had fully withdrawn excise duties on the two cooking fuels in the last budget.

 It has also proposed including diesel in the list of declared goods. This means that the fuel will attract a uniform state sales tax rate of 4 per cent instead of rates as high as 29 per cent. In the last budget, LPG was included in the list of declared goods.

 The petroleum ministry has asked for a reduction in the customs duty on crude as well. Under the current ad valorem customs duty regime, the oil companies have to shell out more by way of customs duties when international crude prices go up, which puts them at a disadvantage. 

 As part of the tweaking of the tax regime, the petroleum ministry is also seeking a shift to specific duties on fuels from the mix of ad-valorem and specific duties.

 However, the finance ministry views the oil sector as a cash cow and taps the highest amount of revenue from it. 

 Since raising revenue collection and reducing the fiscal deficit is a priority for the finance ministry mandarins, the proposals of the petroleum ministry are unlikely to be accepted in full.

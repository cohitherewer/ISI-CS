 Videocon sets date for Timor Sea block drill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 14: Videocon Industries today said drilling in a Timor Sea exploration block, where it held a 25 per cent stake, would begin next year. Videocons share of exploratory expenditure will be $18.9 million. The block is located between Australia and Timor-Leste. 

 In a letter to the bourses, Videocon said the block contained 3.4 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas reserves and 400 million barrels of condensate (liquid hydrocarbons) and LPG reserves. 

 Earlier, Videocon had incorporated a special purpose vehicle called Global Energy Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, to explore, develop and exploit the petroleum block, JPDA 06-103, apart from exporting and marketing of the petroleum. 

 Global Energy Inc is part of the consortium which was awarded the JPDA 06-103 production sharing contract by the Timor Sea Designated Authority. According to the company, there can be substantial condensate recovery from JPDA, which is within the Bonaparte basin with an estimated 23tcf of known reserves. It added that leads had been identified with recoverable potential of oil and gas.

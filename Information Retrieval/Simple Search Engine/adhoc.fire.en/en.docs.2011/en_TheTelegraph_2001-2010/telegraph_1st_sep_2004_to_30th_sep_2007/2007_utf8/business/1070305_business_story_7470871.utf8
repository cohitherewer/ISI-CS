 Big car makers peeved at FM

 EXPECTATIONS BELIED

 New Delhi, March 4: Car companies, an aggrieved lot after the budget, are set to drive into North Block under the platform of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) with their unaddressed demands that include a cut in excise duty on mid-sized and large cars.

 We will submit our demands once again within a fortnight and put forth our view points, said a Siam official. Car manufacturers demanded an excise duty cut for utility vehicles, mid-sized and large cars from 24 per cent to 16 per cent, as charged on small cars.

 According to industry players, disparity will continue in the market if their demands are not met.

 If the objective is to allow the market to grow, all of us need a level-playing field. Why doesnt the government want to make India the hub for big cars? Rajiv Chaba, president and managing director of General Motors India, told The Telegraph.

 As India continues to be primarily a small car market, companies are increasingly concentrating on this segment. Last year, Chidambaram announced an excise reduction to 16 per cent only for small cars in his budget speech. He had said the government wants to make India a small car hub.

 The industry, however, argues otherwise. We need to make room for behavioural changes by giving customers more options. But this can only happen when prices across the board get competitive. Cost is a very important factor, said Chaba.

 Sources said the differential in excise would allow Maruti to maintain its dominance in the market.

 The industry also feels that the budget has largely maintained a status quo in the automobile sector, apart from the 1 percentage point increase in education cess.

 It was like no harm, no gain in the budget. The government did not snatch away anything from us. However, if it wants the sector to contribute more to growth, it should have considered our demands, said a Hyundai official.

 Maruti will raise prices in the next two weeks while Honda Siel Cars India Ltd (HSCIL) has increased the CR-V prices by Rs 10,000-12,000 from last Wednesday night. Other manufacturers said they would soon follow suit.

 The automobile industry contributes 5 per cent to the gross domestic product (GDP). Siam president Madhur Bajaj said, The industry definitely needs more incentives to double its contribution to the GDP.

 The government has brought down peak customs duty by 2.5 percentage points from 12.5 per cent to 10 per cent in the budget. This will lead to a price cut by car manufacturers with high import content.

 Skoda Auto India reduced prices by Rs 24,000 across the board after the finance minister announced a cut in the customs duty. But DaimlerChrysler India (DCI) does not intend to cut prices. This is because the company has a localisation content of 50 per cent across its cars.

 Suhas Kadlaskar, head, corporate affairs and finance, DCI, said, We are neither increasing nor reducing the prices. The benefit of cut in customs duty is compensated by an additional 1 per cent education cess. He, however, added, There is no point in increasing the content since the volumes dont justify.

 Nuclear power plans in jeopardy

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 TROUBLED FUTURE

 New Delhi, Aug. 20: The governments plan to invest up to Rs 60,000 in nuclear power plants is in a quandary with the 123 agreement caught in a political logjam.

 The Congress-led government planned to amend the Atomic Energy Act to allow private sector companies set up nuclear power plants after the market for uranium opened up for India.

 It had also drawn up plans for state-run Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd and National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd to set up nuclear power plants. 

 These two utilities will account for two thirds of projected investments in nuclear power, said officials.

 The government is considering amending the act as India wants to add 20,000mw of nuclear power to the 3,300mw generated by state-run nuclear power plants. 

 It will be impossible for just Nuclear Power Corporation or even National Thermal Power Corporation, which will be entering the sector soon, to spend that kind of money alone, officials said. 

 Planning Commission officials said the act might be amended to allow domestic private sector players such as the Tatas, Anil Ambani-led Reliance Energy, GMR and Essar enter the sector and pave the way for global nuclear plant suppliers to take up small stakes in these entities. 

 At present, only Nuclear Power Corporation of India can set up and run power plants.

 Nuclear Power Corporation plans to set up four plants in Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Bengal. 

 The utility wants to buy the AP1000 series of reactors from the US-based Westinghouse, the ABWR series from General Electric, as well as 1,000mw reactors from Frances Areva and VVR 1,000 reactors from Russia. 

 It is also eyeing minority stakes in Australian uranium mines. Australia has already committed to sell India uranium after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) negotiated a safeguard agreement with India. 

 NTPC, which generates thermal power, is also planning to diversify into nuclear energy and plans to add 2,000mw of nuclear power by 2012.

 It is scouting for sites in Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh. It is also in preliminary talks with a number of global nuclear technology leaders. 

 It is felt that it may partner with the Russians because of lower costs.

 However, these investment plans will remain in limbo till the government resolves domestic differences over the 123 agreement and goes ahead with crucial talks with the UNs International Atomic Energy Agency and the 44-member Nuclear Suppliers Group on norms for supply of uranium and nuclear technology.

 India needs to access uranium supplies as its own stocks are depleting fast.

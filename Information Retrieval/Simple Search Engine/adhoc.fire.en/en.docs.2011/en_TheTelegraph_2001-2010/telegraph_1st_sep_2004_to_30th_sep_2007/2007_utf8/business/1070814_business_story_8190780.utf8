 Calcutta, Aug. 13: Mr G.P. Goenka has objected to the headline of an article carried on Monday, August 13, in Business Telegraph which said he was weighing a selloff in two firms Star Paper Mills and Stone India. What we meant was a small stake sale which the copy clearly mentioned and not a sale of the company, which is an unintended interpretation that can also be drawn from the use of the word. We would like to sincerely apologise to Mr Goenka for any harm to his business interests that the ambiguity in our headline may have caused.

 Lamy upbeat on Doha success

 NEW IDEAS

 Geneva, June 13 (AP): World Trade Organisation secretary-general Pascal Lamy today said a new global trade pact would still be worthwhile even if it failed to lower manufacturing tariffs in Brazil, China and India.

 Lamy also said WTO members expected to finish the long-struggling talks by the end of this year, beginning of next year, a loosening of the year-end goal set by the worlds leading politicians only last week at the G8 summit.

 Cuts in the maximum allowed levels of industrial tariffs as opposed to the rates actually applied by leading developing countries are important for stability and security, Lamy said.

 They amount to real concessions, he added.

 The United States, the European Union and Japan have said emerging economic powers must make cuts in their actual manufacturing tariffs if they expect to secure greater access to the lucrative farm markets in industrialised countries. So far, the demands have been resisted by countries such as Brazil, China and India.

 The talks known as the Doha Round aim to add billions of dollars to the global economy and lift millions of people out of poverty through new trade flows. But they have struggled since their inception six years ago in Qatars capital, largely because of wrangling between rich and poor countries over eliminating barriers to agricultural trade. 

 The impasse on farm tariffs and subsidies has held up progress on manufactured products, which comprise the vast majority of goods traded internationally.

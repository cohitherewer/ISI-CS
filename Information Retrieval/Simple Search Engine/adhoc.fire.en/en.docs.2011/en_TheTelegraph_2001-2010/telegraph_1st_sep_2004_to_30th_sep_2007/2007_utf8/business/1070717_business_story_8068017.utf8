 Jaiprakash to raise Rs 4000cr

 Power plan

 Mumbai, July 16 (PTI): Jaiprakash Associates, the flagship company of the Jaypee group, will raise up to Rs 4,000 crore in overseas markets to fund its expansion plans that include setting up a 500-megawatt power plant in Uttar Pradesh.

 In the first phase it will raise $400 million (Rs 1,600 crore) through the issue of foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs), including the greenshoe option, a company official said.

 The companys board, at its meeting on July 14, approved the raising of up to $1 billion through issue of FCCBs, global depository receipts and any other permissible instrument in the international market.

 Jaiprakash Associates had hired the UK-based Barclays Capital for the FCCB issue, the official said.

 The company, that has posted a 52.17 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 140 crore for the quarter ended June 30, plans to set up a coal-based thermal power plant in Churk district of Uttar Pradesh. The 500mw power plant would be set up at a cost of about Rs 2,000 crore, the official said. The company expected the new plant to be commissioned by 2010, he added.

 Jaiprakash Associates net profit in the first quarter of 2006-07 was Rs 92 crore.

 The total income of the company increased 8.76 per cent to Rs 1,005 crore for the first quarter ended June 30 from Rs 924 crore for the corresponding quarter a year ago, the company said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange. 

 The company declared a dividend of 15 per cent, or Rs 1.50 on shares of Rs 10 each, for 2007-08. Shares of the company closed at Rs 838.60, down 3.68 per cent on the BSE today.

 Apart from the 500mw power plant in Churk, the company is also setting up a 1,000mw pit-head plant in Madhya Pradesh, work on which is yet to begin.

 The Madhya Pradesh plant will reach its full capacity in two phases with 500mw in each phase. The company will use coal from the Amelia block for its first phase, while for the second stage, it will ask for additional coal blocks from the government.

 Last month, Jaipraksh announced its plans to set up a cement factory in Kutch, Gujarat.

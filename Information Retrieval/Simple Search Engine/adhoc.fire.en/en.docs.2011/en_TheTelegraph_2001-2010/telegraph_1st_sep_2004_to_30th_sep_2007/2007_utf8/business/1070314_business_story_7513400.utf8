The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Seven in fray for deep-water port

 S.P.S. PANNU

 Anchor Point

 New Delhi, March 13: Seven foreign consultants are in the race for the deep-water port in Bengal.

 Shipping secretary A.K. Mahapatra told The Telegraph seven companies that have submitted their expressions of interest include Louis Berger Group of the US, Cullen Grunoutt amp; Roe of the UK, Mofalt and Nichol (US), Royal Haskoning BW of the Netherlands, Scidwell Engineering, Canada, Mouchel Parkman (UAE) and Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick.

 Mahapatra said the final selection would be done in two months and the consultants would be expected to shortlist three or four locations for the port. The consultant would also have to look after the entire project work.

 He said it would take four years to build the new port once the work started. The proposal is being taken up to see whether a site with a deeper draft than Sagar can be found on the Bengal coast to set up a modern port. Since the draft at Sagar is not considered deep enough, given the gigantic size of modern ships, it is felt that an alternative site should also be explored before taking the final plunge.

 The shipping ministry has initially set aside Rs 10 crore to complete the study and more funds would flow in later. 

 The state-of-the-art Ningbo port near Shanghai is being considered as a possible model to develop the deep-water port. 

 Ennore, near Chennai, which has been developed with breakwaters constructed by foreign experts, could provide another example that could be emulated.

 A port at Sagar on the mouth of the Hooghly has been under consideration as it would enable the Calcutta port system to take in bigger ships as the draft at the port would be 12 metres. Ships with a 10.5-metre draft could then dock at the port as the mandatory under keel clearance of 1.5 metres for vessels could be maintained. 

 This draft would allow bigger ships than those currently sailing up the Hooghly.

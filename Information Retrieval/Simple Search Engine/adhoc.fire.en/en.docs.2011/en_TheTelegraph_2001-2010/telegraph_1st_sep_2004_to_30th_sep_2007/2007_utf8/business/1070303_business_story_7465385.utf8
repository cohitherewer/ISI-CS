 Birla stake in Hindalco set to rise

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 2: Hindalco Industries will issue preference shares and warrants worth Rs 2,600 crore to its promoters. This will take the promoters holding to 36 per cent from 26.79 per cent. 

 The preferential issue will mostly fund Hindalcos acquisition of Novelis Inc, a leading producer of aluminium-rolled products. Last month, Hindalco announced the buyout in an all-cash deal of around $6 billion.

 At a board meeting today, the directors of Hindalco approved the issue of preference shares and warrants to its promoters. The issue will comprise up to 6.75 crore shares, the value of which will not exceed Rs 1,200 crore.

 Simultaneously, the company will issue up to 8 crore warrants, entitling the holder to get one equity share against one warrant. The amount here will not exceed Rs 1,400 crore.

 Though Hindalco did not reveal the issue price, back-of-the-envelope calculations put it around Rs 178 per share. On the BSE today, the Hindalco scrip ended at Rs 137.85, a gain of 0.47 per cent over its previous close.

 Hindalco will seek shareholders permission for the issue at an extraordinary general meeting on March 28. In a submission made to the stock exchanges, the company said the relevant date to determine the price for the preferential issue would be 30 days prior to the date of EGM.

 Market observers said Hindalco chairman Kumar Mangalam Birlas move to increase his stake via a preference issue is positive since it shows his confidence in the company. 

 At present, institutions hold 36.92 per cent in Hindalco while others, including private corporate bodies and NRIs, own 21.94 per cent. The public holds a 14.35 per cent stake.

 Hindalcos move to acquire Novelis was not greeted with enthusiasm initially on the bourses as investors felt that the acquisition would hurt the companys balancesheet. 

 Hindalco had said the buyout will be financed by $450 million from treasury operations and the rest will be accounted for by debt. 

 Novelis has a strong presence in downstream segments. It is also a leading player in aluminium can recycling. It has a 19 per cent global market share in foil products and 25 per cent market share in construction and industrial products. 

 Last week, Reliance Industries announced a preferential issue for its promoters. The proceeds from the issue will be used to fund the companys exploration and production plans. RIL is issuing 12 crore warrants that are convertible into an equal number of shares. 

 At the price of Rs 1,402 per share, the value of these warrants has worked out to Rs 16,824 crore.

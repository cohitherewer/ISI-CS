 Sweetener for sugar exporters

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 On a sweet note

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: The cabinet committee on prices today lifted the ban on sugar exports, guided by the forecast of domestic output at 240 lakh tonnes in the current season.

 We have got firm estimates of production for the sugar year. We have taken into account the opening stock and buffer norm of total sugar produced and have come to the decision to lift the ban, finance minister P. Chidambaram said. He added that the cabinet considered the positive outlook on output and falling domestic prices to lift the ban.

 The government imposed a ban on exports in July last year to check the price of sugar. The move follows the decision last month to allow traders to export sweeteners using imported sugar.

 Chip policy

 The cabinet today gave its in-principle approval to the semi-conductor policy that proposes incentives to chip makers.

 The incentives will facilitate the creation of an ecosystem for electronics and IT manufacturing and will be available till March 2010. 

 The threshold limit, incentive package and subsidy would be worked out later by the Prime Ministers Office and the cabinet secretary, information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said after the cabinet meeting.

 The policy promises equity participation up to 26 per cent by the government, interest-free loans of up to Rs 400 crore for five years, a 10-year interest subsidy and an income tax holiday. 

 SLR floor

 The Cabinet also approved an ordinance to amend the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. It has also given its nod for the introduction of the Banking (Amendment) Bill, 2005 in Parliament.

 Changes in the banking regulation act will give the RBI freedom to fix the floor and ceiling rates of statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), allowing the apex bank to control the liquidity in the system.

 The ordinance will remove the 25 per cent floor and the 40 per cent ceiling stipulated in the act, leaving it to the RBI to peg the SLR as it deems fit, Das Munshi said.

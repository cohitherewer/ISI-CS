 New Delhi, Feb. 6: British Telecom, UKs largest phone company, today signed an agreement to acquire i2i Enterprise Private Limited, a Mumbai-based enterprise services company.

 BT will become the biggest foreign carrier operating in India as a result of this deal, said Andy Green, chief executive officer of BT Global Services. This investment underlines our commitment to growth from India.

 The BT Group expects sales at its Indian unit to reach $250 million by 2009, Green said.

 The acquiring entity would be BT Telecom India, BTs joint venture with Jubilant Enpro.

 Prakash Jain, chairman and CEO of i2i, said: As our indirect channel partner in the Indian market for BT Infonet, BT has gained an insight into i2is culture and focus on customer service. BT will integrate the strengths of both companies and offer better service to overseas and local multinational customers. 

 Meanwhile, BT is also planning to set up four offices across the country by May 2007 to boost the countrys voice market.

 C.S. Rao, managing director of BT India, said the company is planning to set up offices in four locations. We have identified Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad and Calcutta for setting up our offices by May this year. 

 The company has offices in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.

 BT is also focussing on offering services to mid-size corporate houses. Till date we have been offering managed services to large corporate houses and IT companies. Now our focus is on addressing the mid-size companies as well, said Allen Ma, president of BT Asia Pacific.

 On the national long distance (NLD) and international long distance (ILD) licence, Allen said they had received the letter of intent and were waiting for the operating licence. Once we have the licence, we would be offering services on the ILD. We have already fulfilled the licensing norms, Allen said.

 The UK-based company had formed a joint venture with Jubilant Enpro Private Limited, a New Delhi-based firm, part of the Jubilant Group. 

 BT will hold a 74 per cent stake, while Jubilant holds the rest.

 The joint venture firm known as BT Telecom India Limited provides voice and data services based on virtual private networks, international conferencing services and voice and multimedia services to the back office industry.

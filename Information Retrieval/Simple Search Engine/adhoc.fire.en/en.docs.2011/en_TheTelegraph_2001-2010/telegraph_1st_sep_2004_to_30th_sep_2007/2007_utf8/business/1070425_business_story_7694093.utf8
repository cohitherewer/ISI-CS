 Vedanta wins Sesa Goa bid

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Agarwal: New horizon

 Mumbai, April 24: Vedanta Resources Plc, the London-based metals and mining group, has acquired a 51 per cent stake in Sesa Goa Ltd from Mitsui amp; Co of Japan for $981 million, pricing the deal at Rs 2,036 per share.

 The buyout marks Vedantas foray into the ferrous business. The company will come out with an open offer in four days to scoop up another 20 per cent a mandatory requirement under the takeover rules. If it garners the additional stake, its payout will rise to $1.37 billion. The open offer will close in July.

 Vedanta plans to finance $1.1 billion out of the total projected cost of $1.37 billion through bank loans that it raised recently. The rest will come out of the groups cash resources.

 Sesa has a market valuation of about $1.9 billion. Vedanta will be paying almost 16 per cent above the ruling market price of Sesa. On Tuesday, the Sesa Goa stock closed at Rs 1,698.55 on the BSE.

 Most of the international players pay about 30 to 50 per cent more than the market price while acquiring a company. We are lucky to have acquired Sesa by paying just 16 per cent over its market value, said Anil Agarwal, founder chairman of Vedanta. 

 Considering the huge potential of Indias electricity sector, Vedanta has entered the commercial power generation business through Sterlite Energy Ltd (SEL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Sterlite Industries India Ltd, in which Vedanta holds about 72.3 per cent.

 Vedanta also plans to establish a 2,400-mw coal-based thermal power plant at Jharsuguda in Orissa at a capital cost of about $2 billion. The project will source 13 million tonnes of coal a year from the adjacent mines. The first unit of the project will be commissioned by December 2009.

 Vedanta, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, has a market capitalisation of about $8 billion. The group has drawn up large investment plans in many parts of the world. We are planning to invest about $13 to 14 billion in greenfield and brownfield projects in the next three to five years. Steel is another potential industry for us and we may consider acquiring plants through a partnership or a joint venture, Agarwal added. 

 Sesa is the largest private sector iron ore company in India with exports of over 9 million tonnes. The acquisition will give Vedanta access to Sesas mining reserves and resources of 207 million tonnes spread across Goa, Karnataka and Orissa.

 Dunlop scrip likely to resume trading soon

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Ruia: Taking stock

 Sahagunj, Jan. 14: Dunlop shares are expected to start trading on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in two to three weeks after a gap of almost five years.

 Pawan K. Ruia, chairman of Dunlop India, said the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) has allowed Dunlop shares to be traded on the BSE.

 We have the information that the BIFR has allowed it. I am awaiting an official communication from the board, Ruia said at Sahagunj, where the commercial production of tyres started today after eight years.

 The BSE suspended the trading of Dunlop shares since February 2003 because of non-payment of listing fees.

 The shares were last traded on April 15, 2002 and was quoted at Rs 6.60, below the par value of Rs 10.

 Dunlop is currently under the BIFR, which is working out a revival package for the company.

 The BSE had turned down Ruias plea to lift suspension on trading even after all statutory dues were cleared.

 It argued that the company must get a go-ahead from the Appellate Authority of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (AAIFR) where Dunlop has been referred to as well. Ruia said the company has withdrawn the AAIFR referral. Therefore, a BIFR order would be enough now to start trading.

 The Sahagunj unit will churn out 130 tonnes of tyre and industrial products (conveyor belt) per day at its peak from the present level of 27 tonnes per day.

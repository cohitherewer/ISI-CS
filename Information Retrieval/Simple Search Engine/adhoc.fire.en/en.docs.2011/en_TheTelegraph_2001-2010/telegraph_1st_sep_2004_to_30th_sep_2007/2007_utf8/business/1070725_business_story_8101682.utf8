 New Delhi, July 24: The government is planning an intensive audit of companies in sectors that indulge in tax evasion.

 The high-impact audit must cover assessees, products or sectors which are prone to tax evasion, finance minister P. Chidambaram today said at a conference of central customs and excise commissioners. 

 Top officials said the excise authorities have found many steel, furnace oil and paan masala companies evading excise duty. 

 The high-impact auditing will cover these sectors, they said, adding that it will be based on certain internal risk parameters. 

 The revenue department also plans to publish names of some defaulters, to discourage evasion.

 The finance ministry has sought information from states on collection trends in value-added tax. This will then be compared with excise duty collections.

 If trends reflect an upswing in VAT collection, there should be an upswing in excise duty collections too, said Chidambaram.

 VAT collection by states has increased by 25 per cent in the first quarter of the current fiscal, while excise duties have grown by only 6.8 per cent. Excise duty is levied in the pre-manufacturing stage, while VAT is imposed in the post-manufacturing stage.

 The finance minister said he was confident of meeting the indirect tax collection target of Rs 2,78,031 crore through customs and excise duties for 2007-08. He also expressed satisfaction on the overall revenue performance between April-June. With the economy growing over 9 per cent, the budget estimate of Rs 2,78,013 crore is likely to be exceeded, he added.

 Infrastructure index

 Global index provider FTSE Group and Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) today launched two indices to track share prices of firms in Indias core sector.

 The FTSE IDFC India Infrastructure index will cover 65 companies, while the India Infrastructure 30 index will track the top 30 firms. These are new tools for investors seeking to access the infrastructure market.

 FTSE also plans to develop similar listings for exchange-traded funds and retail funds, said Donald Keith, deputy chief executive, FTSE.

 The new index series will be useful for investors in getting exposure to Indian infrastructure through funds and structured products, said Rajiv Lall, managing director and chief executive officer of IDFC.

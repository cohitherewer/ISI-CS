 ONGC alters Nigeria plan

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, May 28: ONGC-Videsh is focusing on offshore oil assets in Nigeria to steer clear of the ongoing violence in that country. OVL has been awarded two offshore blocks in Nigeria. The company is now completing the legal formalities for the takeover, after which it will begin exploration.

 Initially, OVL expected to complete the formalities in February. OVL managing director R.S. Butola told The Telegraph that the company was focusing on offshore areas as the pace of exploration work was less likely to be affected by the ongoing violence in the country. Indian firms stand a better chance of acquiring oil and gas assets in global trouble spots as the western players are not keen on these areas.

 Geopolitical considerations play an important role in the acquisition of overseas oil and gas assets. For instance, OVL was able to acquire a stake in the Greater Nile oilfield in Sudan because the Canadian company owning the stake had come under fire from radical Christian groups for investing in the Muslim-dominated country.

 OVL has committed a minimum investment of $150 million in the two Nigerian blocks. However, if the company struck oil, it would invest more to develop the fields, Butola said. Seismic surveys have been carried out but OVL may also conduct some additional surveys to get a better geological insight into the blocks, Butola said. 

 The company would also start looking for deeepwater rigs to start drilling wells. There is a scarcity of rigs in the international market and hiring one could take time. But the problem is not insurmountable, he said. According to the current geological data, the blocks have rich potential. Shell and Total are also interested in acquiring a participating share in the two blocks.

 While the upfront fee for undertaking exploration in the two blocks has been kept low, the Nigerian government expects the oil companies to invest around $6 billion in power, railways and oil refineries. 

 The amount will be invested in phases and has been calibrated with the hydrocarbon potential of the exploration block. The investment schedule will depend on the quantity of oil that is produced. The situation in the country is expected to improve by then. Moreover, the development activity is expected to help stabilise the situation.

 The Nigerian government has withdrawn a number of blocks from multinational operators, including Shell, Chevron and Total. The listed blocks are intended to encourage investors to develop power plants and LNG projects in Nigeria.

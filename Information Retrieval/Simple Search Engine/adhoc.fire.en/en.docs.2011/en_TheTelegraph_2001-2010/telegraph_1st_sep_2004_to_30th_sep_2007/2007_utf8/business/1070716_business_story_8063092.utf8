 Lockout at Assam unit of Hind Unilever

 STAFF REPORTER 

 Guwahati, July 15: Hindustan Unilever Ltd locked out its personal products factory in Doomdooma after a series of strikes by the workers. 

 A company press release said the workers had cooped up 18 management staff in the office on July 6 for 16 hours, pushing it towards a lockout. The police today escorted 17 trucks of finished products to the market. These were detained inside the factory.

 The workers went on a strike protesting against various unfulfilled demands, especially non-payment of settlement implementation allowance. Hindustan Unilever said there was no positive response from the union despite managements efforts. 

 On July 10, the firm suspended eight workers responsible for confining the officials. These workers continued to come to the factory and indulge in unauthorised activities, the release stated. 

 The union termed the lockout an undemocratic move. Nirendra Barman, working president of the union, said the company should not have taken such a decision when a tripartite meeting of the management, the government and the union was scheduled at Tinsukia for tomorrow.

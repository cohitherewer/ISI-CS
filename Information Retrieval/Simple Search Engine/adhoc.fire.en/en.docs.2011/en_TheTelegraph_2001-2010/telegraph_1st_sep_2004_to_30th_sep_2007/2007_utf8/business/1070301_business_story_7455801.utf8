 New Delhi, Feb. 28: The immediate buzz raised by wags in the visitors galleries after Palaniappan Chidambarams annual financial statement in the Lok Sabha was that he had just come up with a BETA Budget For the Ethical Treatment of Animals. 

 The quip followed his announcement that he was slashing import duties on dog food and cat food by 30 per cent and 20 per cent. 

 However, when Chidambaram made the announcement, the best-known PETA person for the ethical treatment of animals among Indias politicians was missing. Maneka Gandhi had finished doing her crossword and had left the House.

 In the Opposition ranks, the BJPs Vijay Kumar Malhotra was quickly on his feet when the announcement was made, raising cain much to the dismay of Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, who had thrashed out a compromise and had got all parties to agree that the budget presentation will not be disrupted. 

 Dont you like dogs? the Speaker wondered aloud. Sonia Gandhi, sitting on the finance ministers left, grinned. 

 No one from among the Opposition was going to call Chidambarams handiwork an Alpha budget in any case. But none expected a BETA either.

 The idea that there should be discounts on dog food and cat food in times of inflation invited murmurs of discontent from within the Congress, too. 

 Even a minister raised the frightening possibility of bejewelled pet dogs and cats feasting at a banquet over a menu of cheap imports while farmers sought cheap fertiliser and the consumers cheap vegetables and cereals. 

 The allusion was not only to the slashing of import duties on pet food but also on customs duties on imported uncut gems and jewellery.

 A minister known for his witticism and even stinging repartee, Chidambarams budget speech today was uncharacteristically prosaic. But everywhere in Parliament and even outside the single measure reduction in prices of cat and dog food in the time of inflation spawned a hundred jokes. 

 According to one, Maneka gets her way with Chidambaram better than the Left that has been consistently critical of his policies.

 But Chidambaram did earn a plaudit from the Left. Sitaram Yechury said he was happy the finance minister had decided to ban forward trading in wheat and rice. He hoped the ban on forward trading would be extended to all essential items. 

 Chidambaram had taken this single anti-inflationary measure, Yechury said, but the decision had come a little late. He wished the Congress had learnt from its debacles in the Punjab and Uttarakhand Assembly elections.

 Inside the House, Chidambarams budget presentation was a largely peaceful show in the Lok Sabha in sharp contrast to the din that rocked Parliament over the last two days. 

 The finance minister injected new acronyms into Indias economic parlance AABY for Aam Aadmi Bima Yojana (an insurance scheme for the poor) and TUF Technology Upgradation Fund. He indicated he would get TUF with states if they did not contribute to the AABY.

 Chidambaram took a break only as he came to Part B tax proposals and the House let out a collective aaahhh!. His son, Karti, sitting in the visitors gallery with the rest of the family laughed. 

 A finance minister is tested by the taxes he imposes or cuts. The Opposition benches were a little more restive now. 

 Chidambaram said he was not imposing fresh taxes, that revenue collection was among the best in recent years.

 That was about the time the Opposition benches got a little more restive. Malhotras voice boomed again: Arre, aam admi ko kya diya (what have you given the common man)? But he was promptly told to keep quiet by the Speaker who also asked that the other comments should not be recorded.

 Chidambaram believed till the end that his budget was for the common man and will boost inclusive growth. He quoted South Asias latest Nobel laureate, Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh to wind up.

 ICICI mulls 5% discount for small investors

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 14: ICICI Bank may offer a discount of up to 5 per cent to retail shareholders in its follow-on public offering that opens on June 19. 

 The countrys second largest bank had earlier said that it intended to allot shares to its retail shareholders and individual bidders at a price lower than that for qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) and non-institutional bidders.

 The bank will announce the price band and the discount for the retail shareholders on Sunday. 

 For the overseas market, the issue size is Rs 8,750 crore in the form of American depository shares. 

 ICICI Bank will also mop up the same amount from the domestic market. The issue will close on June 22.

 In addition, there is a greenshoe option under which the bank may allocate additional shares of up to Rs 1,312.5 crore. This takes the size of the issue for the domestic market to Rs 10,062.5 crore.

 The bank is offering other incentives to retail investors as well. Merchant bankers said the small investors would have to pay Rs 250 per share on application and another Rs 250 on allotment.

 Investment bankers cash in 

on floats

 Mumbai, June 24 (PTI): India Incs fund raising spree through public issues has investment bankers laughing their way to banks, with foreign fund managers cornering a large chunk of the pie.

 Companies have mobilised close to Rs 40,000 crore through over 50 public offers on domestic bourses since the beginning of 2007. Investment bankers are estimated to have earned anything between Rs 200 crore and Rs 300 crore for managing these issues. However, a closer look reveals that foreign brokerages have bagged all the major issues, while their Indian firms have cornered a larger number of offers.

 An analysis of all the public issues both initial and follow-on offers that hit the market in 2007 shows that Indian firms have acted as lead or co-lead managers in the book-building processes on 61 occasions, a share more than double of the 30 occurrences the foreign players managed.

 The Indian firms have been outnumbered by the foreign players when it came to managing the top 10 issues, which together raised close to Rs 24,000 crore more than half of the total proceeds from all the issues. In bigger issues of ICICI Bank and DLF, there were more foreign firms than Indian companies.

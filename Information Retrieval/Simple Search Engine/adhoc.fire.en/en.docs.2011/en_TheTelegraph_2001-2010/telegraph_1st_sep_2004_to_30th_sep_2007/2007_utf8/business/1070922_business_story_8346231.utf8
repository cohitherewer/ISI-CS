 Direct tax collection up 41%

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: Net direct tax collections till September 15 of the current fiscal moved up to Rs 1,09,000 crore from Rs 77,000 crore a year ago, an increase of 41.5 per cent.

 The strong numbers are because of more tax deductions at source, buoyant economic growth and improved compliance.

 If the 40 per cent growth rate is maintained for the rest of the fiscal, net direct taxes will touch Rs 3,00,000 crore, officials said.

 During the period under review, advance tax collection is estimated at Rs 57,000 crore against Rs 43,000 crore last year.

 ONGC has paid Rs 3,400 crore as advance tax, the highest among companies.

 The gross tax collection is estimated at Rs 1,26,000 crore against Rs 94,000 crore a year ago. Tax authorities refunded Rs 17,000 crore, the same as last year. Collection target for this fiscal is Rs 5,48,122 crore against Rs 4,67,848 crore (budget estimates) in the previous fiscal.

 New Delhi, April 3: Consumer appliances firm Whirlpool India, which aims to come out of the red this fiscal, is planning to spend approximately Rs 160 crore to ramp up operations.

 We hope to register a profit by the end of this fiscal. We made an operating profit of Rs 44 crore in the previous fiscal against Rs 2 crore in 2005. The company will become profitable soon, Arvind Uppal, managing director of Whirlpool India, told The Telegraph.

 Uppal said the company will invest around Rs 90 crore in the next 12-18 months to increase capacities across its three facilities and another Rs 70 crore on advertising and marketing.

 Whirlpool India manufactures refrigerators in Faridabad and Pune, while washing machines are made in Pondicherry. 

 We are just a whisker away from our closest competitor LG in home appliances. We are aiming for the number one position and plan to fill the gap with new products and aggressive marketing, said Shantanu Dasgupta, vice-president marketing, Whirlpool India.

 The company imports air-conditioners from a clutch of Chinese manufacturers, while driers come from Whirlpools production facility in Europe. Microwave is imported from the companys Chinese facility. 

 Whirpool grew at the rate of 19 per cent in last fiscal and is looking at an overall growth of around 20-25 per cent in the next financial year. Its turnover stood at Rs 1,245 crore in April-December 2006, of which nearly Rs 200 crore came from exports.

 Whirlpool exports frost-free refrigerators to countries in Southeast Asia, Australia, West Asia, eastern Europe and Africa. It also exports a range of kitchen appliances to the US. 

 The company hopes to clock a 20 per cent growth in exports year-on-year, said Uppal.

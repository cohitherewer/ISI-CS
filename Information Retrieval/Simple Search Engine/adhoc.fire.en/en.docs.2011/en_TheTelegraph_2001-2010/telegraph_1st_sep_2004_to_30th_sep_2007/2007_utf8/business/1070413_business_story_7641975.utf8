 Industry fumbles in February

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 12: The growth rate of industry fell to 11 per cent in February compared with 11.4 per cent in January, according to the Central Statistical Organisation.

 Economists in the finance ministry attributed the fall to the brakes on demand because of rising interest rates. This is a sign that the tight money policy is working, they said. 

 The growth rates are calculated from the index of industrial production figures, released monthly by the CSO.

 The growth in money supply which was at a high of 21 per cent is now down to about 19 per cent due to rising interest rates reducing the liquidity in the system.

 Officials said if the inflation rate continues to fall, the Reserve Bank of India may refrain from raising its key rates further.

 The RBI has already raised its benchmark overnight inter-bank lending rate six times in 15 months to check money supply and inflation.

 The banks, taking cue from the rate hikes, have raised their lending rates for both industry and consumers by 2 per centage points to 2.5 percentage points. This has resulted in a check on prices.

 The inflation rate may soon start receding and fall below 6 per cent from 6.5 per cent a few weeks ago, the officials said. This is exactly what we want ... good growth but tempered so that you do not have inflationary surges on the back of growth spurts, they said.

 Growth in consumer durables fell to 1.6 per cent in February compared with 5.3 per cent in January, while electricity production was down to 3.3 per cent from 8.3 per cent. The manufacturing sector, comprising 75 per cent of industry output, however, rose 12.3 per cent compared with 12.1 per cent in January. Mining, too, fared well, growing 6.3 per cent in February compared with 3.8 per cent a year ago.

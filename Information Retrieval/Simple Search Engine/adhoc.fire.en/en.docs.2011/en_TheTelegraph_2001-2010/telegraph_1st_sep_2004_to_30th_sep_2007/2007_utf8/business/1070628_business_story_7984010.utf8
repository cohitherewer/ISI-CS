 Steady move towards full float

 Chidambaram: Hopeful

 London, June 27 (PTI): India will continue with its gradual approach towards capital account convertibility, finance minister P. Chidambaram said today.

 Large capital inflows can create pressures that lead to inflation, and/or appreciation of the exchange rate. We have responded with an appropriate mix of policies in a calibrated fashion without imposing any restrictive capital controls, Chidambaram said at an India-Europe investment forum here.

 He assured European investors that there would be no reversals of economic reforms and the gradual approach towards liberalisation would continue. This approach is also likely to continue in capital account of the balance of payments, he added.

 Chidambaram said the rupee was fully convertible on the current account and transactions were freely permitted. 

 There is de facto full capital account convertibility for non-residents: they can bring in their money and can take out their money, he said.

 Foreign investors can bring in capital and take out their royalties, profits, dividends and capital, including capital gains, he said. 

 India has pursued fiscal consolidation with a determination that has surprised many at home and abroad, he added. 

 The country will require investments worth over $320 billion in infrastructure in the next five years. The finance minister invited European companies to invest in the country.

 The India growth story is a real life story unfolding before our eyes. For India, it is a huge challenge. For Europe, it is a huge opportunity, he said.

 The growth story is likely to continue for many more years provided the government succeeds in attracting domestic and overseas investments.

 The finance minister said that although the European Union was Indias largest source of FDI, accounting for over one-fourth of the total inflow over the past 15 years, the country received only 0.3 per cent of the EUs investments, he said.

 Indias exports to the EU were $23.8 billion during April 2006 to February 2007. The imports from the EU were $24 billion and made up 15 per cent of the imports, he said.

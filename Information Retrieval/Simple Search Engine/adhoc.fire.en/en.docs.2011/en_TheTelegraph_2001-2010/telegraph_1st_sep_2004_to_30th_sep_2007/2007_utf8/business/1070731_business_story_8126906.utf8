 Calcutta, July 30: The Export-Import Bank of India (Exim Bank) plans to double its overseas investments in joint ventures and subsidiaries of Indian companies this fiscal through equity and debt. The bank has earmarked $500 million for this in 2007-08 against $250 million it invested in 2006-07.

 We plan to invest $500 million. As of now, we have received proposals from 10 Indian companies, which are planning either to set up a subsidiary or a joint venture abroad. A number of these companies are from pharmaceuticals, engineering and oil drilling, T.C. Venkat Subramanian, chairman and managing director of Exim Bank, said on the sidelines of a banking conclave organised by the eastern regional council of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry here today. 

 The Exim Bank invests up to 25 per cent in equities if it is a joint venture and 49 per cent if it is a wholly owned subsidiary (of an Indian company), Subramanian said. He added that the banks equity exposure in a particular company is capped at $5 million.

 According to the Exim Bank CMD, the bank participates in equity investment in those takeover projects where the aggregate acquisition value is between $100 million and $150 million. 

 Big companies have other means to raise money to fund their acquisitions. But it is difficult for smaller companies to raise capital to acquire a company abroad, Subramanian said. 

 Exim Banks participation in such ventures also helps small and relatively less known Indian companies raise capital from abroad and attract multilateral funding agencies as equity investors, he added.

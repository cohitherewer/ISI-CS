 RBI focus on full float

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 31: The Reserve Bank of India today said there was a need to explore more instruments for liquidity management, particularly with the country moving to fuller capital account convertibility.

 This was one of the key recommendations made by the central bank in its Report on currency and finance 2005-06: Development of financial markets and role of the central bank released today. In the report, the RBI said although significant progress had been made in refining the liquidity management practices in India, several new challenges had emerged. During periods of abundance, the liquidity adjustment facility window becomes the primary resort for banks to park surplus funds.

 The report added that though the central bank has developed the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) a mechanism to arrest the impact of foreign exchange inflows there is no way of knowing ex-ante whether the liquidity situation is temporary or permanent. Moreover, there is also a limit on MSS issuances.

 These issues need to be addressed, especially in the wake of a progressive move to fuller capital account convertibility. First, there is a need to refine the system of assessing liquidity conditions which calls for an improved framework of forecasting. Second, more weightage needed to be given to movements in international interest rates in view of increased capital mobility, the report suggested.

 On the performance of the economy, the report said both fiscal and revenue deficits would be reduced as projected in the budget in the face of buoyant tax collections. It added that the balance of payments position would be comfortable in the face of surging forex reserves and exports. The optimism would, however, be assessed against the evolving configuration of risks in terms of substantial deceleration of agriculture, presence of supply constraints in the farm sector and physical infrastructure gaps. 

 According to the central bank, the firming up of inflation because of supply constraints, emerging strain from capacity and elevated asset prices would also pose a challenge.

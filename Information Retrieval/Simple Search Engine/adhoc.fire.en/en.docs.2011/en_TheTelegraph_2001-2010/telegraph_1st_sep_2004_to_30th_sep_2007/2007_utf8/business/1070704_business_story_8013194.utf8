 Sensex scales new peak

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 3: Strong global cues backed the rally on the bourses for the second consecutive day. The BSE sensex and CNX nifty scaled new peaks on strong buying in capital goods and banking stocks. Mid-cap counters also witnessed brisk trading.

 The sensex opened firm at 14720 and rallied to an intra-day high of 14828.39 before closing at 14806.51, a net rise of 142.25 points, or 0.97 per cent, from its previous close of 14664.26. With the market barometer breaching the 14800 mark, brokers expect it to cross 15000 in the coming weeks.

 It all depends on the first quarter results, beginning with Infosys. If the company announces robust numbers and gives out a good guidance, the index can settle above the 15000 level, a senior official who looks after portfolio management services with a foreign company said.

 Similarly, on the NSE, the nifty closed at an all-time high of 4357.55, a sharp gain of 43.80 points over its last close of 4313.75. The index scaled an intra-day peak of 4363.35. 

 Brokers said after beginning on a sound note based on positive global advice, shares kept their momentum till the end of the trading session. 

 Unlike yesterday, we did not see any significant profit booking towards the close. The finish, therefore, is highly positive, the official added. 

 All Asian and Pacific stock markets closed in the positive on the back of firm Wall Street advices. The Shanghai composite index ended the day up by 1.65 per cent, Nikkei by 0.02 per cent, Strait Times by 0.54 per cent and Kospi by 1.93 per cent.

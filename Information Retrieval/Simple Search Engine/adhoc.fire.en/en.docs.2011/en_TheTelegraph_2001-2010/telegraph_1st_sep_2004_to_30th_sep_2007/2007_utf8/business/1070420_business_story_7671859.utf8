 Home comfort for small borrowers

 New Delhi, April 19: The government wants banks to hold rates on housing loans up to Rs 10 lakh to help middle class borrowers realise their dream of buying a home. 

 Finance secretary Vinod Rai said, Banks have been advised to protect borrowers taking home loans of Rs 8-10 lakh.

 Analysts said the government was trying to draw a fine line between containing a real estate bubble and encouraging the dream of the middle class to own a house.

 Public sector bankers said they were not considering any further hike in home loan rates. Most of the banks are comfortable with the present interest rate on home loans. We have already increased the rate on commercial real estate loans to 14-15 per cent, thus passing on the burden, said Prakash P. Mallya, chairman and managing director of Vijaya Bank.

 Bank of India chairman M. Balachandran said: We are not planning to tinker with home loan rates.

 On the impact of high-cost borrowings by banks on home loans, Mallya said: Borrowings at a high interest rate in February-March was a temporary phenomenon. After the hike in CRR by the Reserve Bank, banks found it difficult to provide already committed loans so they had to borrow at high rates. Mallya, however, was positive about some moderation in rates once inflation came down to 5-5.25 per cent.

 Banks now charge 11-12 per cent floating rate and 14 per cent fixed rate on home loans.

 Credit growth

 Finance minister P. Chidamabaram wants public sector banks to moderate credit to high-risk sectors like commercial real estate, capital markets and instead lend more to productive sectors and minorities.

 At a meeting with chief executives of PSU banks, Chidambaram said, Credit growth at 30 per cent has to be moderated and, therefore, banks must rebalance their credit portfolio to cool down credit growth in sectors identified as high risk by the Reserve Bank, especially real-estate and capital markets.

 Chidambaram said five communities have been identified as minorities and 103 districts as minority dominated. We have urged banks to open branches in these districts and urged them to monitor flow of credit to minorities.

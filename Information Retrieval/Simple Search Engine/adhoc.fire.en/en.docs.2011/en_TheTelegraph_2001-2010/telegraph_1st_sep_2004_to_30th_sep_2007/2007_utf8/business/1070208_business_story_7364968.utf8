 Kodak plans to hive off film arm

 JAMES DORAN

 Good old days

 New York, Feb. 7: Kodak is considering hiving off its traditional photographic film arm and selling or spinning off the business it created more than a century ago.

 The business, which has long been in decline, could raise as much as $1.5 billion (664 million), according to Wall Street analysts. 

 Antonio Perez, the chief executive of Kodak, who came in three years ago to turn around the ailing company, believes that the traditional film business has just a decade of growth ahead of it.

 To get out of traditional film would be a watershed for Kodak, the company that invented the consumer camera and pioneered the modern film industry. The business has been in decline for years as the photographic industries have been overtaken by the digital revolution. 

 Perez said the Hollywood movie industry is the last big film customer in the world, but that digitisation is gathering pace.

 Digital film is in its infancy in Hollywood, but in maybe three years we will see much more of it, Perez said, adding that he expected Hollywood to have almost completed the switch to digital within 10 years. He declined to comment about a possible sale or spin-off of the film business, but a source said the idea had been discussed by Kodak board members and senior executives and was well within the realms of possibility.

 Reliance stock steals the show

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 16: The Reliance Industries stock vaulted to an all-time high on the bourses and its market capitalisation surged past the Rs 2-trillion-mark after chairman Mukesh Ambani said demand for petrochemicals would remain robust over the next 12 to 18 months.

 On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the RIL scrip ended at a new high of Rs 1,460 after opening at Rs 1,419.80 and reaching an intra-day high of Rs 1,465. At close, the stock rose 3.3 per cent, or Rs 49.35, over the previous close of Rs 1,410.65. Earlier, the 52-week high of the oil giant was Rs 1,445.

 Similarly, on the National Stock Exchange, the stock ended at Rs 1,457.75, a rise of Rs 45.80 over the previous close. 

 The sharp gains propelled the market capitalisation of the company, which has a huge weightage on the BSE sensex, to over Rs 2,00,000 crore.

 Ambani, who inaugurated a new polymers futures contract at the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange today, told reporters that the petrochemicals cycle has not peaked as yet sparking the smart rally in the stock.

 During the third quarter of last fiscal (2006-07), petrochemicals contributed Rs 10,895 crore to the topline of RIL.

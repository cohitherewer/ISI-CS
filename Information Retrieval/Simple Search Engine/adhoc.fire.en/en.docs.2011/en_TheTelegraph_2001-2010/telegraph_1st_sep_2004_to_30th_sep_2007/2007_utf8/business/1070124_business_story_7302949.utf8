 All eyes on Hutch board

 Hong Kong, Jan. 23 (PTI): The board of Hutchison Telecom International Ltd is likely to meet on Monday.

 Sources close to the development said the board would meet on January 29, but it was not clear whether it would take a call on the sale of HTILs stake in the Indian mobile venture.

 A spokesperson for HTILs parent company, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd, Jeremy Lau, declined to comment on board matters.

 Hutch Essar, in which Indian partner Essar Group holds a 33 per cent stake, is being wooed by a number of suitors, including the UKs Vodafone and Reliance Communications. Besides, Essar itself is in the race to acquire control of the company.

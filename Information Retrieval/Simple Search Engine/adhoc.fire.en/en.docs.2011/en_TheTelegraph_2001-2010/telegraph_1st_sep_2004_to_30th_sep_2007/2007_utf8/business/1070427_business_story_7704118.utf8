 Revenue guidance under Sebi scanner

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Damodaran: In action

 Mumbai, April 26: The Securities and Exchange Board of India today said it might review the industry practice of giving revenue guidance.

 Speaking at a Ficci meeting here today, Sebi chairman M. Damodaran said it had become difficult to know where guidance stops and forward-looking statements start.

 The practice of providing guidance was being reviewed even in the US, he said, but did not say if he intends to put an end to such announcements.

 At present, its largely the domestic infotech companies that provide guidance, which, according to Damodaran, results in building up of street expectations.

 Responding to various queries of industry captains at the meeting, Damodaran said Sebi was planning many changes and work was in progress to give effect to them.

 According to the Sebi chairman, the market regulator is planning to change the practice of declaring dividends on a percentage basis and ease the procedure for issue of shares on rights basis.

 Damodaran also announced that companies would not be required to send full balance sheet and annual report to shareholders. They can now send only a statement containing important features of the balance sheet, profit and loss account and auditors report.

 Tata Motors to tap foreign markets

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 20: Tata Motors plans to raise $450 million from overseas markets to meet capital and product development requirements for its various projects.

 This decision was taken at a board meeting held today. 

 Though Tata Motors did not provide details, officials said they were looking at a variety of instruments. Funds raised would be used for existing and upcoming projects and might include the small car project, they added. 

 Market observers feel the company may opt for a global depository receipts issue.

 The company has informed stock exchanges that the funds raised will be used for projects in the commercial vehicle and passenger car business units and for such other corporate purposes as may be permitted under applicable laws.

 Tata Motors plans to launch its small car in the first half of 2008. The car will be priced at around Rs 1 lakh. Chairman Ratan Tata told shareholders in the companys annual report for 2006-07 that a range of products was lined up to be launched over the next two years. 

 This will be the most aggressive new product programme in the companys history. The focus has been on innovation and market leadership, he added.

 Last fiscal, the company sold 334,238 commercial vehicles and 246,042 passenger vehicles at home and abroad. In passenger vehicles, it is the second largest player in terms of domestic sales with a 16.5 per cent market share. 

 Tata Motors also worked towards setting up a greenfield manufacturing facility in Uttarakhand.

 Tatas not to bid for rump VSNL stake

 Mumbai, Feb 12 (PTI): The Tata group today decided not to bid for the governments 26 per cent residual stake in VSNL, a source said.

 The company has decided not to exercise its call option (the right of first refusal) because it feels there is no major advantage in exercising this option at this juncture, the source said.

 VSNL, an erstwhile public sector company, was privatised in 2002 with Tata picking a controlling stake and the government with a minority 26 per cent.

 Company officials could not be reached for comments.

 It is understood that Panatone Investments, Tata Power along with other companies of the Tata group, who are promoters of VSNL, decided not to exercise the option.

 The Tata group, which has a combined effective shareholding of a little over 50 per cent in VSNL, felt that there would be no significant advantage in exercising the call option, the source said.

 The arrangement with the government, which has two representatives on VSNLs board, has worked well so far.

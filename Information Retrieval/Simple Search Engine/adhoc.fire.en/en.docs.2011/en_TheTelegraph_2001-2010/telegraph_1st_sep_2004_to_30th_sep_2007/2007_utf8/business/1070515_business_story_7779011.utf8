 India Incs gain is taxmans pain

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 14: The income tax department has erred in calculating the taxes of some leading companies such as Reliance Industries, Coca-Cola, Tata Motors and Bank of Baroda.

 This has led to a loss of around Rs 1,054 crore in revenues, according to the comptroller and auditor general (CAG).

 Reliance Industries paid Rs 376.17 crore less in taxes in the assessment year 2002-03 because of the faulty calculation.

 In Tata Motors, the omission reduced the companys liabilities by Rs 261.13 crore. However, the authorities have taken remedial action. 

 The CAG also found a flaw in Tata Sonss liabilities. The company paid Rs 93 crore less because of an incorrect estimate of its turnover by the authorities.

 The CAG report for March 2006 said the fact that the brought-forward loss of Rs 1,364.38 crore of Reliance Petroleum had been fully set off in the revised assessment order of July, 2004 was not taken into consideration while making the assessment of RIL in March 2005. The mistake resulted in underassessment of income... with short levy of tax of Rs 376.17 crore.

 The under-assessment in GTL Ltd, previously Global Telecom, was Rs 104.84 crore.

 Two steel companies paid less taxes. The liability of Tata Steel was lower by Rs 69.64 crore and Jindal Steel and Power by Rs 19.90 crore. The authorities made mistakes in calculating the expenditure of Jindal Steel and Power.

 The shortfall was Rs 189.19 crore in Bank of Baroda. However, the department has addressed the problem.

 The revenue loss is Rs 46.94 crore in Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt Ltd, the Indian subsidiary of Coca-Cola Inc.

 The others to have paid lower taxes include Asia Net Communications, Polaris Software and Indo National Ltd. 

 The report said the authorities have wrongly assessed the liabilities of some software companies.

 Mahindra British Telecom should have paid Rs 52.3 crore more in taxes. The revenue losses in Afteck Infosys and MphasiS BFL were in the range of Rs 5 crore to Rs 10 crore.

 Ispat Industries under the Calcutta 

 income-tax circle should have paid Rs 41 crore more. The 

 report said that the company was erroneously allowed excessive 

 deferred revenue expenditure which brought down its 

 liabilities.

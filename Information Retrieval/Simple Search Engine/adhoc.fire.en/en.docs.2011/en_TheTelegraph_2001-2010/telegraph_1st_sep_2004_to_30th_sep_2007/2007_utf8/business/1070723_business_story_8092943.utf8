 Aditya Birla Nuvo plans retail chain in garments

 New Delhi, July 22: Aditya Birla Nuvo is planning to open a retail garment store chain in the country.

 The Aditya Birla group company will invest Rs 400 crore initially to set up the chain, which is to be named after its mens apparel brand, Peter England.

 Executive director Vikram Rao told The Telegraph, This store will have some association with Peter England, which happens to be an Aditya Birla brand.

 Rao said, The first store or set of stores will be opened by the first quarter of 2008. In the first phase, the stores can be opened in metros and mini metros or they can be concentrated in one particular region.

 East is a critical region for us, said Rao, though he did not name any city in which the stores would come up. Though officials said nothing was decided yet, the company could use a mix of company-owned and franchise stores to kickstart the chain.

 Rao said the company would now focus on India. However, it planned to take the brand abroad in the future. 

 The Peter England brand is worth Rs 200 crore and is growing at 25 per cent year-on-year. Around 230 franchises, 30 company-owned and several wholesale stores sell the Peter England brand across the country.

 The plan for a retail chain comes in the wake of a recent move, which saw Madura Garments, also a part of Aditya Birla group, separating its fashion brands (Van Huesen, Allen Solly and Louis Philippe) and its popular brand Peter England. 

 Aditya Birla Nuvo has appointed Alok Malik as the president of Peter England Fashions and Retail.

 The group also has Planet Fashion stores in India and West Asia, for which the company has planned expansion.

 Meanwhile, Hindalco Industries Ltd, part of the AV Birla group, has acquired the 45 per cent stake held by Canada-based Alcan in the Utkal Alumina project at Orissa for an undisclosed sum. 

 The deal marks the complete exit of Alcan from the Utkal project. Alcan will have no surviving rights or obligations, as Hindalco becomes the 100 per cent owner of the project.

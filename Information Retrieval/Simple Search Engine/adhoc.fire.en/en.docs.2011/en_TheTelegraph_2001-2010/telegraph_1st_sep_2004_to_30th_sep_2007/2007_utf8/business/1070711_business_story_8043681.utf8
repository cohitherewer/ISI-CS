 One-month result deadline

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 10: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today passed an order making it compulsory for all listed companies to come out with their financial results within a month after the end of every quarter. 

 Revising the provisions in clause 41 of the listing agreement, the market regulator mandated all the stock exchanges in the country to modify the process and formats for submission of quarterly and annual financial results by the companies. 

 Sebi said the modifications were being made to enable investors to glean the performance of the companies as early as possible. 

 Companies have an option to furnish either unaudited or audited quarterly and year to date financial results to the stock exchange within one month from the end of each quarter. 

 If they choose to furnish unaudited financial results, the companys results shall be subjected to a limited review and a copy of the report shall be submitted to the bourse within two months from the end of the quarter. 

 Further, the revised clause has simplified the provision for explanation in the variation between items of unaudited and audited quarterly or year to date or annual results.

 The revised clause requires an explanation for variations to be furnished in respect of net profit or loss after tax and for exceptional or extraordinary items. The percentage of variation has been revised from 20 per cent or more earlier to 10 per cent or Rs 10 lakh, whichever is higher. 

 The amendment also said the companies having subsidiaries, which file both stand-alone and consolidated results to the stock exchange, will now have an option to publish stand-alone or consolidated results. This would be subject to the condition that the company would not be allowed to change its choice during that financial year. 

 A company would be required to produce comparative figures for the previous financial year if it changes its option in any subsequent financial year. 

 The regulatory body has directed the countrys stock exchanges to monitor compliance with the submission of financial results, based on quarterly returns submitted by companies, and inform about the status of implementation of the requirements of the circular in the next monthly development report.

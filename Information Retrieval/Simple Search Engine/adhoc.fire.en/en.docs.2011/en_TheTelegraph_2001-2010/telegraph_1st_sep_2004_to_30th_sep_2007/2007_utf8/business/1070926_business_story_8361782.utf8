Calcutta, Sept. 25: City-based Balmer Lawrie amp; Company, a public sector undertaking under the ministry of petroleum, has chalked out a plan to extend its logistics services through acquisitions and quit the ailing container manufacturing and tea businesses. 

 The company has put its 24,000-square-foot tea blending facility in the UK on the block. It has invited expressions of interest within September 27 from potential buyers. 

 Balmer Lawrie managing director S.K. Mukherjee said the company would also sell its blending facility in Calcutta. We want to get out of the ailing tea business in the future, Mukherjee said. Tea contributes 2 to 3 per cent to the companys annual turnover. 

 Balmer Lawrie wants to hive off its container manufacturing facility in Coimbatore to Transafe Services Ltd. 

 The unit is a joint venture between Balmer Lawrie (29 per cent stake) and ICICI Venture (71 per cent). While the boards of the two companies have approved the proposal, we are yet to get the governments nod, pending which the transfer could not be effected, Mukherjee said.

 The company has already closed its container manufacturing facility in Kochi. 

 Mukherjee said competition from China had made the business unviable. 

 However, the company will invest Rs 100 crore in container freight stations and inland container depots. 

 There are three container freight stations of the company in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai.

 In logistics services, the company is eyeing acquisitions, especially firms in the export business. We already have services for importers. We want to acquire logistics service providers engaged in air or ocean exports, Mukherjee said.

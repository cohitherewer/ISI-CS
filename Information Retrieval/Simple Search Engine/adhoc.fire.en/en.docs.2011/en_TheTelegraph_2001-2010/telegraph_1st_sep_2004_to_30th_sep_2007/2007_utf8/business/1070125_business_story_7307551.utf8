 New Delhi, Jan. 24: The government is planning to announce third generation (3G) spectrum policy by March this year. The policy will be ready by March 2007, said Dayanidhi Maran, minister for IT and communications. 

 The department of telecom (DoT) had formed a committee to look into the recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on 3G spectrum pricing and allocation. The panel will submit its report soon and the DoT will then finalise the policy, the minister added. 

 Of the 45 Mhz spectrum to be made available, 25 Mhz is in the 2.1 Ghz band for 3G services and the balance 20 Mhz is in the 1,800 Mhz band for 2G services.

 Maran also said the cabinet has given an in-principle approval to the semiconductor policy but the final recommendations would be announced after Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs nod. We have already lost out on Intel due to the delay in announcing the policy, he said. 

 The semiconductor policy demands equity participation of up to 26 per cent by the government and interest-free loans of up to Rs 400 crore for five years. It also demands a 10-year interest subsidy and an income tax holiday.

 These special incentives will help create an ecosystem for the development of electronics and IT manufacturing. The incentives will be available to companies till March 2010. The policy encourages investment of nearly Rs 1,000 crore in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. 

 Maran also said the small and medium enterprises can play an important role in the services sector. The contribution of the services sector to GDP has crossed 50 per cent and will reach 70-80 per cent as it is in developed countries, the minister said.

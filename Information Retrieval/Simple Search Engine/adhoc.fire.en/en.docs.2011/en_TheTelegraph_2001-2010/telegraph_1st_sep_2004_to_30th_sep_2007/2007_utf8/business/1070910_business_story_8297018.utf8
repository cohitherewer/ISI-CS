 Sebi plans to expand investor choice

 Mumbai, Sept. 9 (PTI): The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is in favour of introducing more products.

 We can achieve further growth by ensuring more investors and more products in the market, Sebi chairman M. Damodaran said when he was asked whether the country could advance further in the global ranking.

 India has developed into a big market. We are the 10th largest market in the world and will surely grow further ... We have achieved this without much PSU divestment, he said.

 Confident that the market is in for a major expansion, he said deepening of the market was a definitive safeguard for investors. With the growth in the market, more investors can participate, he said.

 The growth itself is a measure of the investors protection, he said, adding that the market regulators three objectives investor protection, market development and regulation could not be seen in isolation and should be read in tandem. 

 Emphasising that the market needed more products for further growth, Damodaran said, New products, such as interest and currency derivatives, are required ... There are some new products in the pipeline.

 He said in the F amp; market, the option segment had not grown despite growth in the futures segment.

 As we go forward, we will look at launching products to bolster growth in the futures and option segment, he said.

 Damodaran, who dislikes to be drawn into day-to-day market movement, said the economy was growing. He also said his role as a regulator was to guard against any malpractices.

 People keep asking me as to where the market is heading for ... And I tell them this is an answer nobody knows, he said, emphasising that Sebi would do everything to protect investors from wrongdoings.

 BoI to run a realty check

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Revision time

 Mumbai, Aug. 22: The Bank of India (BoI) will revalue its fixed assets specifically real estate properties as part of a move to raise its Tier II capital.

 Tier II capital is secondary bank capital that includes undisclosed reserves and subordinated term debt. Banks or companies revalue their assets to bring into their books the fair market value of fixed assets such as properties. In some cases, companies sell their assets after a revaluation.

 The BoI informed stock exchanges that its board of directors met today and decided to revalue identified fixed assets and take into account the appreciation in their value during the current quarter. The public sector bank added that according to the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), 45 per cent of revaluation reserves could be counted as Tier II capital. 

 The companys Tier II capital will accordingly stand increased once the process of revaluation is completed and the reassessed value of fixed assets is crystallised, the bank added.

 Very few banks have revalued their assets in the recent past. Banking industry sources do not discount the possibility of the BoI selling off some of its properties after the revaluation. BoI officials were not available for comment. The bank did not disclose which properties it intended to revalue.

 In an earlier guideline on the revaluation of reserves, the RBI had said revaluation reserve could not be considered as core capital as they were less permanent in nature.

 It had told banks that revaluation reserves should be considered at a discount of 55 per cent when determining their value for inclusion in Tier II capital or only 45 per cent of revaluation reserve should be taken for inclusion in Tier II capital. 

 Such reserves would have to be reflected in the balance sheet as revaluation reserves, it said.

 The RBI had also told banks to take adequate steps while formulating a policy for revaluation of their properties. As it was necessary that revaluation reserves represented true appreciation in the market value of the properties, it said banks should have a comprehensive policy for revaluation of fixed assets owned by them.

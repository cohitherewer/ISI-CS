 Govt to vet Wadia plaint

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Wadia: Not amused

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: The government today said it would examine the complaint of Britannia chief Nusli Wadia against French major and its joint venture partner Groupe Danone for violating Press Note 1 of 2005.

 We have received a letter from the Wadias about their partner (Groupe Danone). We have just got the letter and are yet to look at its content. We will see what action needs to be taken, said Ajay Dua, secretary, department of industrial policy and promotion, on the sidelines of a retail summit organised by industry chamber Assocham.

 According to Press Note 1 of 2005, government approval is required for a foreign company setting up a new subsidiary or joint venture if it has a joint venture in the same sector. The Wadias have also sought details of the deal between Danone and Bangalore-based Avesthagen, which makes bio-actives for food products. Groupe Danone has picked up a 5 per cent stake in the company, through its subsidiary Daninvest.com SA, a company incorporated in France.

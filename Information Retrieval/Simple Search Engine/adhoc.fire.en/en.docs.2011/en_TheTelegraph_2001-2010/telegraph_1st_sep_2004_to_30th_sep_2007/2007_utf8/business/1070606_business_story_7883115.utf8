 Union wants say in Stelco

 New Delhi, June 5 (PTI): Canadas leading steel workers union has said it must be involved in the sale or merger of Stelco to ensure rightful dues to serving and retired employees.

 Stelco, which manufactures 3.7 million tonnes of different categories of steel, said it was reviewing strategic options in light of the ongoing consolidation in the steel industry. 

 The company also said it was evaluating alternatives, including mergers, strategic partnerships, acquisitions or a sale of all or part of the company.

 If this review results in a sale or a merger, we expect to be involved to make sure that no action is taken without informing workers and retirees, United Steelworkers national director Ken Neumann was quoted as saying by news portal Sootoday.com.

 Tata Steel is reported to be in the race to acquire Stelco along with Russian firms Severstal and Evraz.

 A Tata Steel spokesman said the company was scouting for steel mills across the globe, but refused to comment on reports that it was looking at buying the Canadian firm.

 The portal quoted Neumann as saying that there was every indication Stelco was readying itself to entertain bidders and if the recent steel company selloffs were any indication, Stelco will no longer be a Canadian company.

 Foreign takeovers in mining, steel and other industries are turning Canada into a cash cow for global interests, he said and suggested that the management should honour all obligations with respect to benefits and pensions of serving and retired workers, the portal reported. The portal quoted Neuman as saying the union expected the owners to live up to their commitment of respecting employees, honouring obligations with respect to benefits and pensions for workers and full disclosure of corporate plans.

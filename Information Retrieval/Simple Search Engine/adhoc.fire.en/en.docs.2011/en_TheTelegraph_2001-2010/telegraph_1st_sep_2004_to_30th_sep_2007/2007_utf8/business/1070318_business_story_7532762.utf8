 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 17: Bosch, the German automotive and industrial technology company, has outlined an investment of Rs 1,800 crore in India till 2008. 

 The company, which reported a turnover of Rs 5,000 crore in India for 2006, will invest the amount in its consolidated business, which includes automotive technology, consumer goods amp; building technology and industrial technology. 

 Motor Industries (Mico), where Bosch holds over 60 per cent share, today declared that the company has achieved net sales of Rs 3,783.7 crore for January to December 2006, which is 27 per cent higher than the previous years net sales of Rs 2,977.5 crore. The net profit stood at Rs 548 crore, a 60 per cent growth over Rs 343 crore posted in the previous year. 

 Bosch established its footprint in the country through its four partners Mico, Bosch Rexroth India Ltd, Robert Bosch Chassis Systems India Ltd and Robert Bosch India Ltd. 

 Recognising the prolific season the auto industry is enjoying in India, Mico managing director Albert Hieronimus said the company plans to pump in more funds to strengthen its workshop network in the country. 

 Mico has invested Rs 550 crore to set up manufacturing plants in Bangalore. Hieronimus said about 49 per cent of the Rs 1,800 crore would be invested in products such as common rail systems, gasoline injection systems, packaging machinery and electronic control units. 

 Diesel, being clean, is the future for India, Hieronimus said, adding that the auto market in India and China are changing with the growing economy and this would fuel the growth of after-market requirements like car wash equipment as well. For this fiscal, Mico generated nearly 15 per cent of its total sales from this business. 

 Mico joint managing director Ferdinand Allerkamp said the companys growth in the auto segment is attributed to exports, which accounted for almost 47 per cent rise. 

 In the non-automotive segment, the growth has been driven by sales of packaging machines, which witnessed almost 70 per cent growth during 2006.

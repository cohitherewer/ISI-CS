 Suzlon jumps on deal news

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 25: Suzlons shares today jumped 22.52 per cent on the bourses after it gained control of REpower Systems. Rival Areva pulled out of the race to acquire the German wind turbine firm yesterday.

 On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the scrip opened firm at Rs 1,153, touched a high of Rs 1,420, but later pared some gains and closed at Rs 1,378.45, up 18.94 per cent. Over 17.56 lakh shares changed hands in early morning trade.

 The scrip showed a different trend from that of traditional share price movements after a company acquires another firm, leading to pressures on its balance sheet. Tata Steel and Hindalco had witnessed a plunge in their share price after the acquisition of Corus and Novelis, respectively.

 Suzlon and French group Areva have now signed a pact to combine their holdings.

 Suzlon Energy and its partner Martifer own close to 30.91 per cent stake and Areva has about 30.16 per cent stake in REpower, which under the binding agreement works out to over 60 per cent. The rest of REpower stakes are held by the German firms shareholders.

 With this arrangement, Suzlon now controls over 60 per cent of REpowers capital, directly and through voting pool arrangements, Suzlon chairman and managing director Tulsi Tanti said.

 Areva and Martifer have the option to sell stakes to Suzlon Energy after one year and two years, respectively.

 Over the next one week we will also know how many stakeholders have tendered their shares, Tanti said.

 The company expects to get an additional stake of 10-15 per cent at the end of the day when its offer period closes. 

 Areva said in a statement it would benefit from an exit guarantee ensuring a value creation of over 350 million euros. 

 Tanti, however, said there was no guaranteed exit price. After a year, the price would be determined by fair value. 

 Suzlon had offered 150 euros per REpower share, valuing the German company at around 1.2 billion euros. The Pune-based company expects an initial consideration of 250 million euros for REpower. It had already put in 100 million euros. 

 With this acquisition, Suzlon has emerged as a true global player, Tanti said.

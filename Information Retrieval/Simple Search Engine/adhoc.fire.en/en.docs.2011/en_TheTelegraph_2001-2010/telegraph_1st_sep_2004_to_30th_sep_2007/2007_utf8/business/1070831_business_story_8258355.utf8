 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 30: Mobile phone production in the country is expected to grow to 107 million units in 2011 from 31 million units in 2006, a compounded annual growth rate of 28.3 per cent. According to research firm Gartner, revenue from this sector is forecast at $13.6 billion in 2011 compared with $4.9 billion in 2006 

 Ganesh Ramamoorthy, principal research analyst, Gartner, said, Existing global handset vendors as well as new entrants will outsource their production to electronics manufacturing services vendors to reduce time to market and achieve faster penetration for their own branded handsets. 

 This will raise the vendors share of total mobile phone production in India to nearly 40 per cent by 2011, he said.

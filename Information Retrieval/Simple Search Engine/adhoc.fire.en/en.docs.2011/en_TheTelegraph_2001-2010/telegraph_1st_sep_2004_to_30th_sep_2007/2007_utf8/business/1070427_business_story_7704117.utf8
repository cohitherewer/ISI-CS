 Trio in pact for steel plant

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Hyderabad, April 26: Three public sector undertakings the RINL, SAIL and the NMDC have joined hands to set up a 4-mt steel plant in Chhattisgarh. The public sector trio is planning to take this alliance further to other states as well.

 This is a step towards building synergies of PSUs under the ministry of steel and will help in meeting the growing demand of steel in the country, SAIL chairman S. K. Roongta said, commenting on the new initiative.

 The NMDC mines at Bailadilla will supply iron ore to the proposed steel plant. The Chhattisgarh government wants the NMDC to use part of the Bailadilla ore in projects within the state.

 The government had earlier planned to create two behemoths one by merging all steel public sector units and another by merging all iron ore mining PSUs. 

 However, opposition from state governments and labour unions thwarted this plan. The latest plan seems to be an attempt to stall moves by private steel makers such as Essar and Ispat from taking control of mining leases owned by the NMDC. 

 The Bailadilla complex in Chhattisgarh, leased to the NMDC, has the best quality lumpy ore in the world, with an iron content of more than 66 per cent. The ore is also free from sulphur and other impurities. 

 The NMDC is a leading iron ore company and joining hands with steel makers like SAIL and the RINL would be a win-win for all three PSUs, steel industry observers said.

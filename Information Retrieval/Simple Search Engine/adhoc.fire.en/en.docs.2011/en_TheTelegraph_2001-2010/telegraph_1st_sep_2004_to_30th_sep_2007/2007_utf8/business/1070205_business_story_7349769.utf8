 ONGC to set up $4.5bn refinery in Ecuador

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

Calcutta, Feb. 4: ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) will set up a $4.5-billion oil refinery and petrochemicals project in joint venture with PetroEcuador and Petroleos de Venezuela, Carlos Abad, Ecuadors ambassador to India, said.

 PetroEcuador is the state oil company of the Latin American country. Abad is Ecuadors first ambassador to India. Ecuador established its embassy in India two years ago. 

 At a meeting organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce here last week, Abad said Ecuador was looking at strengthening its trade ties with countries such as India to reduce its dependence on the US.

 We want more companies from India and China to invest in Ecuador, particularly in the oil, gas and power generation sectors. We have many companies from the US and Canada and we now want firms from other parts of the world to come to the country, Abad said. 

 While Canadian companies account for 69 per cent of the total foreign direct investment in Ecuador, the US make up for another 20 per cent.

 ONGC Videsh and PetroEcuador signed a memorandum of understanding last July when Ecuadors minister of external affairs, Francisco Carrion Mena, came to India. The MoU envisaged cooperation between the two companies in developing and promoting petroleum, gas, electricity, petrochemicals, hydrocarbon products and petroleum research.

 According to the agreement, ONGC Videsh and PetroEcuador would also collaborate in exploration activities and bid for oil and gas blocks in Ecuador and other Latin American countries through joint ventures. 

 Ecuador exports crude and imports refined petroleum. The country has no refinery like Nigeria, said Vinay Goenka, who has been appointed as the honourary consul of Ecuador in Calcutta by the newly-elected government in the Latin American country. Over 59 per cent of Ecuadors total exports comprise crude oil and natural gas.

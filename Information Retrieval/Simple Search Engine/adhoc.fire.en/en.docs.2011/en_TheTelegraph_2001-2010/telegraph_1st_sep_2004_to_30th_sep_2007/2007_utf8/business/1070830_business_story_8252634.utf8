 Calcutta, Aug. 29: Bajaj Auto is planning to phase out its 100cc motorbikes in a year.

 The motorbike segment in India is changing gears from 100cc to 125cc bikes as start-up models. 

 The two-wheeler company also plans to launch a 125cc digital twin spark, swirl induction (DTS-Si) engine model priced below Rs 44,000.

 As in all mature markets, India too will shift from the 100cc or 110cc to the 125cc model. We plan to get the maximum share of the market while this shift is happening. Our newest offering of DTS-Si engines will blur the borders between 100cc and 125cc and offer a value not available in the market before, said Amit M. Pawar, regional manager of Bajaj Auto.

 The 125cc model will be launched in the middle of September and will be priced between Rs 42,000 and Rs 44,000. The bikes will be manufactured at the companys Waluj plant near Aurangabad.

 Bajaj aims at selling 42,000 to 44,000 units of the new model.

 The company manufactures Platina and Discover models in the 100cc category. The segment contributes almost 30 per cent to the firms turnover. 

 Around 75,000 to 80,000 Platina and Discover units are sold every month. It also manufactures CT 100 on orders.

 However, despite the low pricing, there will be a price gap of Rs 10,000 between a 100cc and a 125cc model.

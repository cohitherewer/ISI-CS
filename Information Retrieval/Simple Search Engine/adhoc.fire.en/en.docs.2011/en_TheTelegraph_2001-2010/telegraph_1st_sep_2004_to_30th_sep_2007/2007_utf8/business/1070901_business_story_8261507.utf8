The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Travel trade unfazed by Hyderabad blasts

 Fear factor

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: The travel and trade industry feels terrorism will not affect the tourist flow into India.

 However, the recent blasts in Hyderabad have taken India off many a travellers list of preferred destinations. Countries such as the US, the UK and Australia have already issued advisories against travelling to India.

 Travel agents, on the other hand, believe terrorism has become a way of life all over the world and as a fear invoking mechanism has lost its edge.

 The first reaction to terrorism is fear. However, it is being accepted as an act which no individual or institution has control over. Business is therefore running as usual without any major sign of cancellation, said Subhash Goyal, president of Indian Association of Tour Operators.

 Tour operators said they would leave no stone unturned in selling India as a safer destination than most of Asia.

 Terror threats make a difference but hardsell and more personal explanations should ensure that tour groups do not cancel flights. Thats what most operators are doing right now, said Debasish Chatterjee of CTI Travels.

 We have not yet received any cancellation from any of our tour groups. There is still time before the peak season sets in. However, such incidents do lend a bad name to the country and psychologically makes the place less attractive for either business or leisure travellers, said Dimple Singh, general manager business development, Creative Travel.

 The number of foreign visitors to Hyderabad has been increasing over the years. According to tourism department figures, more than 5,70,000 foreigners visited the city last year.

 Bharat Petro exits Shell joint venture

 Slick move

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) has decided to sell its entire 49 per cent stake in Bharat Shell to Shell Overseas BV and exit the lubricants joint venture.

 The BPCL board of directors has approved the proposal and the company will now enter into necessary agreement with Shell to complete the deal, a senior company official told The Telegraph.

 Bharat Shell Limited (BSL), a joint venture between BPCL and Shell Overseas Investment BV (Shell) of Holland, was incorporated in 1993 to market Shell lubricants in the country.

 The joint venture has an authorised capital of Rs 250 crore and a paid-up capital of Rs 200 crore. While Shell holds 51 per cent of the equity, the remaining 49 per cent is held by BPCL.

 BSL was also marketing LPG to domestic and industrial consumers. Since LPG is sold to households at a subsidised price by public sector companies, it could not really get going in the business and had to focus essentially on lube sales.

 While BPCL had been selling the Shell brand of lubricants from its retail outlets initially, this had turned out to be a misadventure for the Indian company as its own domestic brand of lubricants had been edged out by the foreign brand.

 Meanwhile, Indian Oil Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum had been pushing ahead with their own brands of lubricants and BPCL had fallen behind in the race having become dependent on Shell.

 The company then realised that it should push its own brands and went in for a concerted marketing effort to re-brand and re-launch its lubricants under the Mak brand. A BPCL official said the company is now doing well in the lubricants segment and commands a 12 per cent market share.

 The Shell brand of lubricants is also doing well, though Shell does not have the advantage of a nationwide petrol pump network like the Indian companies. The foreign major has been selling good volumes through what is called the bazaar segment comprising retail spare part shops and dealers.

 Shell is also promoting industrial lubricants. It has recently signed an agreement with Schwing Stetter India Pvt Ltd.

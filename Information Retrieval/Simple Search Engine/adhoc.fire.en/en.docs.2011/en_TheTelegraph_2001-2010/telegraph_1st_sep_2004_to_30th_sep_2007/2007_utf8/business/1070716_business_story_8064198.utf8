 Cloud over iron ore bid norms

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

New Delhi, July 15: The Centre is in a fix over the opposition by iron ore-rich states to the auction norms in the draft mineral policy.

 States have been asked to auction ore among steel companies without insisting on mills within their boundaries. 

 Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka the states rich in ore have opposed the proposal.

 They are objecting to the clause because they fear a loss of much needed investments. 

 New industries and jobs not only enrich a state but also create political capital for the incumbent government. 

 The norms mean steel giants such as Posco and ArcelorMittal can get ore only from auctions. 

 They cannot negotiate for leases on the basis of setting up units within a state. ArcelorMittal has plans for units in Jharkhand and Orissa, while Posco is making preparations for a plant in Orissa.

 Top officials said it was not possible to ignore the views of the states on this issue.

 However, if states are given the leeway vis--vis setting up mills within their boundaries, others will stand to lose.

 Agreeing to tie up mining rights in this manner could create different kinds of problems. Steel needs iron ore and coal as well as manganese. If the same steel companies have to promise facilities in three states which supply each of these raw materials, it will never be able to reach economies of scale, the officials said. 

 The draft policy has also not imposed quantitative or qualitative caps on iron ore exports. It has accepted the Hooda committee recommendation of using varying tax rates to discourage exports of high- grade ore.

 The officials said this has sparked a serious lobbying war with steel makers insisting on a qualitative cap to disallow exports of high-grade ore. The Indian Steel Alliance also wants a quantitative cap on export at 2006 levels as a huge surge in capacity will require most of the countrys limited reserves. 

 Last year, exports were estimated at about 90 million tonnes, more than half of which went to China.

 The Federation of Indian Mineral Industries, which represents ore exporters, says there are enough reserves to take care of the needs of both the steel industry and exporters.

 It says 80 per cent of ore exports comprises low-grade fines that are not used by steel mills. The draft norms were finalised by the group of ministers at their meeting here on July 6.

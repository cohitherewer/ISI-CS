The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Rule to blunt CSN edge in Corus battle

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Costly deal

 Calcutta, Jan. 23: Brazilian steelmaker Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) may have built up a stake in Corus, but that is unlikely to have any bearing on the outcome of its gripping takeover battle with the Tatas.

 CSN had announced that it has a 3.8 per cent stake in the company when it went official about its interest in the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker on November 17.

 The company, along with its associates UBS AG, Goldman Sachs Group and Barclays, holds more than 20 per cent stake in Corus, going by their filings to the London Stock Exchange (LSE). 

 Compared with that, neither Tata Steel nor its allies has any stock in Corus that is worthy of mention.

 Contrary to the speculation that the Tatas might find the going tough to clinch the deal once the offers are put to vote, experts say the UK legal system may prevent a cakewalk for CSN on the strength of its shareholding.

 It is almost certain that the UK court, which will oversee the scheme of arrangement for the Corus acquisition, will put the shareholding CSN and its allies under the scanner before allowing them to participate in the voting at the extraordinary general meeting.

 The court appointed meeting of the shareholders will decide the fate of Corus eventually.

 John Bennett, head of corporate law at London-based law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner LLP, told The Telegraph that CSN may not be allowed to vote to approve a scheme meeting.

 For the purpose of the scheme meetings, the court would almost certainly take the view that CSN and possibly its advisers (depending on the capacity in which they hold the shares) will be treated as a separate class for the purposes of the scheme. If this is the case, their shares will not count for the purposes of the vote to approve the relevant scheme, he explained.

 CSN allies, however, had said they hold these shares as part of their asset management business and cannot be clubbed together.

 If the court agrees to this view, they will not be treated as a separate class and will be able to vote on the proposals, he added.

 In case of a photo finish, the Tatas will breathe a little more easy if the court places a freeze on CSNs individual voting rights.

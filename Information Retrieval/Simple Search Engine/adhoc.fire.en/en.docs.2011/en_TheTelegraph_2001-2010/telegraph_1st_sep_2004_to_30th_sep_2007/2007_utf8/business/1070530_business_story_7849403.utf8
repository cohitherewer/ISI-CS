 Tata Steel in Vietnam 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Muthuraman: New ground

 Calcutta, May 29: Tata Steel today signed an MoU with Vietnam Steel Corporation for a 4.5-million-tonne project. 

 If it comes up, the plant will be Tata Steels first overseas greenfield venture. Tata Steel will hold a majority stake in the joint venture with Vietnams largest steel company.

 Tata Steels earlier attempts to set up greenfield units in countries such as Bangladesh and Iran are yet to make much headway. 

 However, Vietnam looks to be a safer bet for geopolitical reasons. Moreover, the $3.5-billion project that will come up in the Ha Tinh province in phases over the next 10 years has the blessing of the Vietnam government. 

 Vietnam Steel is a state-owned company. The Vietnam government had directed it to select a foreign partner for the project and they chose Tata Steel.

 In Bangladesh, the company is yet to sign even an MoU as the local government drags its feet over the Tata proposal. In contrast an MoU was signed in Iran but no further headway has been made in the country under US sanction over nuclear programme. 

 Tata Steel will hold a minimum of 65 per cent equity in the project. It will also get a 30 per cent stake in the Thach Khe iron ore mining project. 

 Koushik Chatterjee, vice president (finance) of Tata Steel, however, said it would be difficult to predict if Vietnam will be first. Only when we complete the feasibility study, a clear timeframe can be drawn, he said.

 The MoU was signed between Vietnam Steel president Dau Van Hung and Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman in the presence of top Vietnam government officials.

 Tata Steel already has a joint venture with Vietnam Steel in rolling mills through NatSteel Asia, which is a Singapore-based subsidiary of Tata Steel. 

 Vietnam has a GDP growth rate of over 8 per cent and per capita steel consumption of over 85kg.

 Starbucks entry after two years

 New York, Aug. 2 (PTI): Coffee lovers in India may have to wait up to two years to savour the Starbucks brand, with the worlds biggest coffee retail chain revising its plan to open its first store in the country.

 Starbucks, which was earlier eyeing its India foray by the end of 2007, withdrew an application on July 19 to operate single brand retail stores and said it was postponing its India plans without giving a time-frame for future plans.

 However, the companys chief operating officer and international business head Martin Coles said late last night that Starbucks now planned to open its India stores in the next year or two.

 We recently withdrew our application to enter India as we refocus our efforts in Asia Pacific, which is a key region for our company, but we remain very excited about the potential of this country and plan to open that market in the next year or two, Coles told analysts at a conference call to discuss the companys third quarter results.

 Starbucks reported a 20 per cent jump in quarterly revenue to $2.36 billion. It also announced plans to open 2,600 new stores in 2008-09, an increase of 200 from this fiscals target. Its international revenue rose 28 per cent to $432 million in the quarter.

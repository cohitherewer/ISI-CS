 New Delhi, June 22: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today conferred the navratna status on three central public sector undertakings the Power Finance Corporation, Bharat Electronics and Hindustan Aeronautics.

 This takes the number of navratna public sector enterprises to 12. The title was originally meant for nine companies in 1997.

 The navratna status will raise the financial and administrative powers of the PSU boards. They will now be able to form joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries at home and abroad. They can also invest up to 15 per cent of their net worth in one project up to a limit of Rs 1,000 crore. 

 Moreover, the boards will have the power to decide on mergers and acquisitions.

 Chidambaram emphasised the UPA governments commitment to strengthen public sector enterprises and said more autonomy should be given to these units. The finance minister asked unlisted public sector companies to list on stock exchanges to unlock their true value.

 Chidambaram also unveiled the corporate governance guidelines for central public sector enterprises. The guidelines will be applicable to both listed and unlisted PSUs.

 Price factor

 The finance minister attributed the fall in inflation to tight monetary measures adopted by the Reserve Bank, but said it was too early to reach any conclusion on the price situation.

 It (inflation) is as we have anticipated. Monetary tightening measures have had an impact, the minister said. 

 The rate of inflation fell to 4.28 per cent for the week ended June 22 compared with 4.80 per cent in the previous week.

 Jindals clinch Bolivian deal

 New Delhi, March 2: Jindal Steel amp; Power has got the go-ahead from the Bolivian government to invest $2.1 billion in a steel manufacturing plant and mining activities at El Mutun, which contains rich iron ore reserves. The Jindals have finally clinched the deal after eight months of tough negotiations.

 Bolivian President Evo Morales and Jindal Steel chief executive Vikrant Gujral have signed preliminary agreements on the tax rate and natural gas prices for the iron and steel project. They will sign a definitive contract within 45 days, the company said today.

 Bolivia expects to receive around $200 million a year in profit sharing and taxes from the 40-year concession at El Mutun.

 El Mutun is estimated to contain 40 billion tonnes of iron ore of medium-grade quality. The deposit is located southeast of La Paz, near the Brazilian border.

 Jindal will produce at least 1.5 million tonnes of steel a year in the Latin American country and will build a 400-mw thermal plant near the El Mutun deposit.

 The Indian company said it would create 4,600 direct jobs in the iron ore mine and the steel plant. 

 The project will allow Bolivia to develop a steel-making industry and is the biggest investment in a single project in Bolivian history.

 Jindal Steel will start building a steel plant in Bolivia at El Muton in three to four months. The whole project will be completed in various stages in eight years, finance director Sunil Maroo said.

 In June last year, Jindal won an international bid to exploit 50 per cent of the El Mutun reserves in a joint venture with the Bolivian government.

 But the signing of the contract was delayed as the Jindals wanted the Bolivian government to subsidise the price of fuel and scale down the high rate of taxes.

 Bolivia, a major natural gas producer, agreed to sell natural gas to Jindal Steel at $3.91 per million BTUs (British thermal units) for steel making, which represents 70 per cent of the projects power needs, officials said. Jindal will pay $1.955 per Btu for gas to generate power, which will take care of 30 per cent of its power needs.

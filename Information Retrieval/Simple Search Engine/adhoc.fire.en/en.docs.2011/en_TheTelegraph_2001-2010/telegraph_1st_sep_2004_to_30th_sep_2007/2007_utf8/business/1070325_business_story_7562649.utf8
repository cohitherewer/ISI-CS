 Chidambaram: Strong note

 New Delhi, Mar 24: In the backdrop of cement players refusing to cut prices, finance minister P. Chidambaram today asked India Inc to look beyond their balance-sheets and play a role in helping the government ensure macro-economic stability.

 At a media conclave here, he said core inflation was affecting macro-economic stability. I have said this before and saying this once more that please dont allow core inflation to be entrenched, he said.

 Meanwhile, Chidambaram praised the decision of the Left parties to stand by their industrialisation policy in Bengal despite the trouble in Singur and Nandigram. 

 The Bengal governments policy to promote industrialisation is a sign of maturing of the Left parties, Chidambaram said.

 The avowed policy of the Bengal government is to promote industry ... But then they run into conflict with a section of their own people, and with those espousing the cause of those affected, he added.

 On the farmers agitation at Nandigram, he said it was a difficult task to frame a balanced policy.

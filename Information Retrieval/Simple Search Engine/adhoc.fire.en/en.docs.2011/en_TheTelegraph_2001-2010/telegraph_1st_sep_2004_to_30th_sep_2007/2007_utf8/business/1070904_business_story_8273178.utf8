 Home ministry leash on airline FDI

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Under control

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: The home ministry wants the management of domestic airlines to be retained by the government or in Indian hands. 

 In a note to the group of ministers, which will soon finalise the civil aviation policy, the ministry stated that it had no objections to current or proposed FDI ceilings. However, management control should be with local entities or the government.

 Officials said the ministry was aware that even with a 49 per cent stake, a foreign investor could be the largest shareholder, giving it control.

 There is also no objection to stakes by foreign airlines in domestic companies.

 However, the ministry wants its civil aviation counterpart to accept its suggestions on security aspects of the proposal. 

 The finance ministry would like to allow foreign airlines a 26 per cent stake within the 49 per cent FDI cap in domestic carriers. However, the civil aviation ministry is against such a step as this will allow foreign carriers to use domestic airlines as feeders for international operations, which will harm the prospects of state-run Air India.

 The home ministry note has also opposed private ground handling companies, because of security reasons.

 No restrictions have been placed on private greenfield airports and private domestic airlines on this count. The ministry is (also) not in favour of allowing foreign airlines to do self handling, the note says. 

 Earlier, the ministry had thwarted moves to let Gulf-based agencies into ground handling.

 Current rules allow three entities in ground handling one run by the airport itself, one by a ground handling company and another by national carriers or their subsidiaries.

 The segment has attracted many players, including Air India and Jet Airways. The national carriers are looking at a tieup with Singapore Airport Terminal Services. Others in the fray are the UK-based Menzies Aviation and Swissport International.

 In principle, the ministry wants to vet all joint ventures in aviation, especially those with foreign investment. 

 It wants intelligence agencies to examine all FDI proposals in aeronautics, aviation design and repair and maintenance hubs. There is a global alert on terror groups using aviation facilities or spares. That explains the ultra-conservatism on the part of the home ministry, officials said.

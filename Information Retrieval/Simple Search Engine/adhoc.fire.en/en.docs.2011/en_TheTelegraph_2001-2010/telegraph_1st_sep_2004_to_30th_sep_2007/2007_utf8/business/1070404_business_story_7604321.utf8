 Bhel blueprint to boost turnover

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Puri: Moving forward

 New Delhi, April 3: Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel) has clocked a net profit of Rs 2,385 crore for the financial year ended March 31, a 42 per cent jump over Rs 1,679 crore recorded in the previous year.

 Bhel chairman Ashok Puri said the companys earnings per share had also gone up by 42 per cent to Rs 97.4 and it had an orderbook worth Rs 35,633 crore against Rs 18,938 crore in the previous year. Orders worth Rs 27,722 crore were secured in 2006-07.

 Puri said Bhel has drawn up a strategic plan to take its turnover to $10 billion by 2011-12 from $4 billion.

 The plan focuses on capacity and capability enhancement that will leverage the companys efforts in power, supported by industry, transport, transmission, exports and spares and services businesses, he added.

 He said Bhels manufacturing capacity would go up to 10,000 mw per annum by the end of 2007 from 6,000 mw at present and the company plans to invest another Rs 3,200 crore to increase its production capacity to 15,000 mw a year by 2012.

 Puri said Bhel was capable of meeting the countrys demand for setting up power generation plants during the Eleventh Plan. He dismissed the power ministrys argument that the country needs to set up another heavy electrical equipment company to meet the machinery and equipment demand for power projects in the Eleventh Plan.

 He said Bhel was undertaking brownfield expansion of its manufacturing units, which was much cheaper and quicker than any greenfield project to set up a heavy electrical equipment company. It takes five to six years to set up a company like Bhel and the cost involved would be much higher for the country than expanding the capacities of Bhel, he added.

 Puri said the delay in supplying equipment in some cases was because all the orders were bunched up towards the fag end of the tenth plan (2002-07). 

 The construction companies required to carry out the civil works had also held up the projects, he added.

 If the orders are evenly spread out over the five-year plan period, Bhel would have no problem in meeting the demand, he added. 

 Puri said Bhel was getting around 65 per cent of the orders for power plants in the country. The rest were being undertaken by foreign companies like French heavy electrical equipment maker Alstom and German engineering giant Siemens with whom Bhel was competing. 

 Bhel had expanded its international business securing export orders to Rs 1,903 crore during the year compared with an average annual orderbook of Rs 1,275 crore in the previous five years. 

 He said the company had spread its global footprint by making its foray into Tajikstan, a new market, and into a host of new market segments in Sudan, France, Egypt, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Sweden and Oman.

 He also said the company was looking out for merger and acquisition opportunities both overseas and in India to expand its operations.

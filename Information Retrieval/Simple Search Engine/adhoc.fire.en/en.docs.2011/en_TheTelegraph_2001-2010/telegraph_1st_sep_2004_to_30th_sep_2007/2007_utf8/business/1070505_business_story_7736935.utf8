 Microsoft mulls $50bn bid for Yahoo

 New York, May 4 (PTI): Microsoft Corporation is planning a $50-billion bid for Yahoo Inc in one of the biggest takeover deals in the technology space, US media reports said.

 If successful, the deal could have a big impact on the global IT space, including India, where both Microsoft and Yahoo carry huge brand value and enjoy significant exposure.

 According to the Wall Street Journal and New York Post, Microsoft, which has a market cap of close to $300 billion, has intensified its pursuit of Yahoo after holding informal talks over the years.

 The renewed talks come amid growing threat from search engine and online advertising company Google Inc for both the companies. In fact, Google replaced Microsoft as the worlds leading brand last month.

 The approach follows an offer Microsoft made to acquire Yahoo a few months ago, the New York Post reported quoting unnamed sources. While Yahoo had spurned the advances of the Redmond-based software giant in the past, Microsoft is seeking to re-enter formal negotiations, it said.

 The daily said market sources are putting a roughly $50 billion price tag on Yahoo.

 Shares of Yahoo jumped over 15 per cent in early morning trade on US bourses, taking its market value to about $44 billion from $38.2 billion yesterday.

 Both Microsoft and Yahoo have significant exposures in India. The expanding number of Internet and mobile users in the country is attracting these two companies, who are eyeing businesses in this market to add to their future growth.

 Wheat import deadline

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 30: The government today extended the deadline for import of duty-free wheat till December 31 as it is worried that the FCI wheat procurement is not progressing according to expectations. 

 This is the second time that the Centre has extended the last date for duty-free wheat imports as prices of the cereal have been rising and its buffer stocks are low. The government had first extended the deadline till February 28 and now till the end of this year despite forecasts of production of over 72.6 million tonnes this year against 69.35 million tonnes last year.

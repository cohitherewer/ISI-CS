 Tata Tele looks for tower ally 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 8: Tata Teleservices Ltd (TTSL) plans to hive off its cellular tower business. It is in talks with six players, one of whom could be roped in as a partner.

 A deal is likely to be struck in three months. The main objective of the proposed divestment is to focus on expanding the companys network. 

 TTSL plans to invest over Rs 3,500 crore next fiscal to build its network, enter new circles and widen its reach. TTSL now operates in more than 3,100 towns across 20 circles. 

 The company has submitted an application to enter Assam, Jammu amp; Kashmir and the Northeast circles even as it wants to enter at least 1,000 new B-class towns with population between 20,000 and 50,000. 

 It has drawn up a roadmap to ramp up its customer base to 100 million by 2011 from 15.5 million. TTSL chief executive officer Darryl Green said while towers are not essential to the business, the goal is to monetise the asset.

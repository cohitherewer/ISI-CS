 Nirulas spread for more cities

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 4: Customers in Mumbai, Pune, Calcutta and Bangalore will soon be able to gorge on Delhi-based food chain Nirulas famous hot chocolate fudge.

 Samir Kuckreja, CEO and MD of Nirulas, said the company was planning to invest Rs 100 crore to take its brand beyond its home turf. In two years, we will open 150 outlets in the northern, southern and eastern parts of the country, Kuckreja said on the sidelines of the retail seminar here today.

 The company is also looking to open an outlet in Bhubaneswar. Nirulas had recently said it planned to set up food courts jointly with Mars Restaurants. The plans evolved after India Hospitality Corp acquired Mars Restaurants and Sky Gourmet Catering for $110 million from Malaysian private equity firm, Navis Capital. Navis has retained an option to re-invest up to $75 million in India Hospitality, which will increase its stake in the latter to 20.7 per cent.

 SAILs total income during the quarter stood at Rs 8,760.16 crore compared with Rs 6,736.84 crore in the same quarter previous fiscal, up 30 per cent quarter-on-quarter.

 Our production was up 6 per cent and sales were up 9 per cent during the third quarter, which helped us post healthy growth figures, SAIL chairman S. K. Roongta said here today.

 He said other factors that contributed to the growth in the third-quarter figures include better product mix, use of improved technology and energy consumption measures.

 The demand in the period was driven mainly by sectors such as infrastructure, construction and automobile, Roongta added.

 For the nine-month period ended December 31, the company reported a 47.79 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 4,300.41 crore compared with Rs 2,909.7 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.

 The nine-month net profit and turnover this fiscal is the highest ever registered by SAIL. We have also declared the highest ever nine-month interim dividend of Rs 660.86 crore in the period. The outlook for the next quarter is good and we are aiming for 5 per cent higher capacity utilisation over third quarter, Roongta said.

 SAIL is in the process of increasing its overall production capacity to 22 million tonnes per annum from the present 12 million tonnes at an investment of about Rs 40,000 crore.

 On the companys plans to raise funds to support expansion, Roongta said, Our internal accruals are strong... We will raise funds as and when required.

 On Chiria mines, SAIL boss said: PMO has taken up the issue and the company is in talks with the Jharkhand government to get renewed mining lease.

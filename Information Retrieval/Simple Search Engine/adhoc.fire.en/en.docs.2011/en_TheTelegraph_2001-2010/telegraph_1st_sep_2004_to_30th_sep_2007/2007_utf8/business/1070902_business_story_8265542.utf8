 Trio in pact to switch on power-packed plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 1: Three entities Athena Projects Pvt Ltd, Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) and PTC India Ltd will jointly set up power plants with a capacity of 10,000MW by 2015.

 The joint venture company, Athena Energy Ventures Pvt Ltd, will have an initial authorised equity capital of Rs 750 crore. The shareholding of Athena Projects, IDFC and PTC will be in the ratio of 52:28:20. 

 The plan to generate 10,000MW will require an investment of Rs 40,000 crore through equity and debt.

 Athena Projects, headed by T.V. Vijay Kumar, is promoted by a group of high net worth individuals based in India and the US. The investors from India include N. Prasad of Matrix Laboratories and some from the senior management of the Karvy group.

 T.V. Krishna, managing director of Athena Energy Ventures, told The Telegraph that the company would initially set up four projects in the country. These are a 3,000MW hydro power project in Arunachal Pradesh, a 2,400MW coal-based unit in Andhra Pradesh, another 1,320MW coal-based plant in Chhatisgarh and a 2,400MW gas-based project.

 Krishna said the company would focus on generation and might turn to transmission and distribution at a later stage. 

 Union power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said an additional capacity of 78,000MW had been reserved for the Eleventh Plan. Earlier, there was a poor response from private companies to set up power projects in the country because of worries over payment by electricity boards. However, in the past five years, no company had complained of not being paid for power generated and supplied by them to state utilities.

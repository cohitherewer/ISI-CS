 Calcutta, Feb. 2: Microsoft and Nortel will jointly launch SIP phones under the Nortel-LG brand by the end of the year. The phones will have embedded Microsoft software and touchscreen facility for the first time in India.

 Session initiation protocol (SIP) enables two or more people to make phone calls to each other using the Internet. Using the Internet to make phone calls is known as voice over internet protocol (VoIP). SIP calls on broadband are digital quality calls across the street or across the globe. SIP-to-SIP calls are always free.

 Calls from SIP to traditional phones or public switched telephone network (PSTN) are inexpensive, involving no tax or monthly fee and including features such as multimedia conferencing. 

 Details, especially the pricing, are being worked out for the global launch in December 2006. Such phones will be imported to the country and users, including enterprises, will no longer require a personal computer or laptop to make VoIP calls. This is an example of unified communication where Nortels expertise in telephony and network and Microsofts software will combine voice, data and video into effective, low-cost solutions for enterprises, said Sukhvinder Ahuja, Microsoft business leader of Nortel Networks India Pvt Ltd.

 The Microsoft-Nortel alliance will be for enterprise or business solutions. Services will include various product developments, sharing intellectual property rights, sales and marketing of the products and integrated services for maintaining such solutions.

 A couple of months ago, Nortel launched its analogue phones for the small and medium business markets and the company is reportedly working towards launching a model to cater to the middle-level market.

 Fresh tea stock to arrive late

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Slow starter

 Calcutta, March 25: Tea production in the new season will start late because of low temperature in the north and Northeast.

 Unusual weather patterns are affecting the initial crop prospects in many tea growing regions worldwide.

 Arrivals in all the three auction centres at Guwahati, Siliguri and Calcutta are behind schedule compared with the corresponding previous period.

 At the Calcutta sale 14, which is traditionally the first sale where new season tea is offered, only 3,000 packages have arrived compared with 8,500 in 2006. At the Siliguri sale, which closed on March 17, only 1,314 packages could be offered. 

 In the corresponding previous season, the sale had closed with a total of 22,344 packages.

 At the Guwahati sale 14, only 3,636 packages will be on offer compared with 9,545 packages in the corresponding previous season, according to figures of J Thomas amp; Co Pvt Ltd.

 The sale at Calcutta for the week ended March 16 was put off because of few offerings, while a limited quantity of end-season tea was on offer at Guwahati and Siliguri in the same week. 

 Prices were also irregular at these auctions. 

 The loose tea segment of the domestic market was active, while the major packeteers were selective. 

 Provisional production reports from Indonesia for January to November 2006 are reported to be lower by 16.1 million kg over the same period in 2005.

 In Vietnam, the season had a slow start and an improvement in the production pattern is not expected before April.

 Exports from Vietnam in 2006 were around 105,116 tonnes, an increase of 17,198 tonnes over 2005. International markets are responding to the overall production scenario.

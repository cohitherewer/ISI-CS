 India Inc all praise for freight proposals

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Railway Budget 

 New Delhi, Feb. 26: Praising the railway budget, India Inc today said measures on containers and freight services will not only help the industry but benefit the general public as well.

 Congratulating the railway minister on a growth-oriented budget, the steel industry said the announcements would have a positive impact on demand for steel.

 Freight reduction of 6 per cent on iron ore, limestone and dolomite is likely to have a positive impact of around Rs 70 crore annually on SAIL, said S.K. Roongta, chairman of Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL). 

 The announcement of dedicated freight corridors is also a positive step and, when completed, would help meet the growing transportation requirements of the economy, he added. Reflecting similar sentiments, Essar Steel director J. Mehra described the budget as a shift from passenger-related issues to economy-related issues.

 Basic freight rate on iron ore will support our topline, he said, adding that the freight rate cut will reduce iron ore costs by Rs 40 per tonne. 

 For Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), a 5 per cent cut in freight rates will mean a reduction of Rs 35-40 crore in under-realisations, said S.V. Narasimhan, finance director of IOC.

 However, since the oil sector uses railways to transport only a fraction of their products, the announcements did not have any major impact on the sector, analysts said.

 The budget is good for the industry engaged in supplying equipment to the Railways, as plans to invest more in manufacturing wagons will help shore up the order book, said S.K. Nevatia, CMD of Hind Rectifiers. 

 Nevatia added that the outlined requirement for coach and locomotive capacity and their expansion of freight corridors means an increase in requirement for equipment that they will have to supply to the Railways. 

 Welcoming the cut in freight rates on petrol, diesel and iron ore, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said it would have a positive impact on the economy. 

 The freight impact on the industry is in the right direction and general approach of the budget was to improve efficiency and higher output, said J. P. Choudhary, chairman railways equipment division, CII. 

 Assocham also welcomed the budget for successfully linking old economy with the new and taking full advantage of modern technology. 

 Assocham president Venugopal N. Dhoot said, Lalu Prasad has done his best to enhance the operational efficiency of Indian Railways without introducing any increase in freight and fare charges. He added that the proposals will encourage capacity-building in steel, cement and coal. 

 Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry president Habil Khorakiwala applauded the Railways on its move towards becoming a private sector corporation. 

 This is great news for India. We wish other public services, especially in the social sector, such as education and health, will follow suit, said Khorakiwala.

 However, PHDCCI observed that the railway budget had failed to carve out the strategy for long-term sustainability of growth and investments. 

 Considering the fact that the Railways are the only high capacity transport mode that can meet the long-term growth needs of our large economy, it has still not done enough to rise above the populist and short-term focus in announcing new initiatives and passenger fare cuts, said Sanjay Bhatia, president of PHDCCI. 

 The low-cost airlines said the fare cuts would not have much impact on the cost of air travel. G.R. Gopinath, CMD of Air Deccan said they will not revise air fares, as most of the low-cost airline fares are below first and second class AC fare of railways.

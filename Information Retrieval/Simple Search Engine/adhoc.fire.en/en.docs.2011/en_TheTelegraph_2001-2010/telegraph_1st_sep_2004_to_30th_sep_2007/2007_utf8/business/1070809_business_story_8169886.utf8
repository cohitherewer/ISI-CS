 UTI Mutual in Singapore 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Foreign foray

 Calcutta, Aug. 8: UTI Asset Management Company Pvt Ltd today signed a joint venture agreement with Shinsei Bank of Japan to set up an asset management company in Singapore. The new company will be called UTI International (Singapore) Pte Ltd. 

 According to a senior official, UTI Asset Management Company (UTI AMC) will hold a 51 per cent stake in the joint venture through its Guernsey-based wholly owned subsidiary, UTI International Ltd. Shinsei Bank will own the remaining 49 per cent stake.

 A.K. Sridhar, chief investment officer of UTI Mutual Fund, will be the chief executive officer of the company and will be based in Singapore. UTI International (Singapore) will manage investments and distribute financial products of UTI Mutual Fund and Shinsei Bank in Southeast Asia. 

 Besides selling investment products to customers in Singapore, the company will manage funds investing in other countries. The company will launch and manage structured investment products to cater to the Japan-Southeast Asia corridor, a UTI AMC release said.

 We are trying to build our expertise in investing in overseas markets. This is a step forward in that direction, said Ashish Ranawade, head of portfolio management services at UTI AMC.

 Last year, UTI AMC tied up with Shinsei Bank to launch India-dedicated equity schemes through which investors in Japan and South-east Asian countries could invest in companies listed on Indian bourses. Following this tie-up, the Shinsei UTI India Equity Fund was launched last December. 

 As of now, it has an asset base of $300 million. Ranawade is its joint fund manager. 

 UTI AMC also has a similar agreement with the US-based asset management company, State Street Global Advisory (SsgA). 

 But we have not launched any fund under this arrangement, Ranawade said.

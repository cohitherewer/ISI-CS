 Infotech firms want more tax sops

 JAYATI GHOSE

New Delhi, Feb. 20: The IT and IT-enabled services (ITeS) industry expects this years budget to remove central sales tax, retain tax sops awarded to software technology parks and provide greater incentives to investors.

 The Manufacturers Association for Information Technology (MAIT) and National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) expect the budget to increase the profitability of the domestic IT and ITeS sector to make it competitive on a global level.

 Stressing the need for a stable policy regime, MAIT president Mukul Singhal said: We emphasise on maintaining a status quo on tax structures for IT products, including the continuance of a reduced excise duty of 12 per cent on PCs. Since 2004, the PC industry has witnessed changes in the excise duty structure. However, it is only in the last one year that an excise regime was introduced to establish a level-playing field between local manufacturing and imports. It is imperative that this continues.

 However, using the mobile industry boom as an analogy, Kiran Karnik, president of Nasscom, said abolishing excise duty on PC hardware would lead to reduction in computer prices, which in turn would have a cascading effect on PC penetration in the country.

 Moreover, V. Balakrishnan, CFO of Infosys Technologies, said, Direct tax rates should be brought down further by eliminating various surcharges. Excise duty should also be cut, which will stimulate the domestic demand for goods.

 Meanwhile, MAIT, the apex body representing the countrys IT hardware, training and R amp;D services firms, stressed on the need to remove the central sales tax (CST).

 CST, which is a major deterrent to local manufacturing, must be removed immediately, said Singhal. 

 The industry also wants all IT products to attract the same VAT rate across the country. 

 The confusion over applicable VAT rates, which has arisen from the changes in the Harmonised System of Nomenclature (HSN) from January 1, 2007, must be cleared. Accordingly, the VAT rate on IT products must be restored to the earlier 4 per cent immediately, said industry analysts.

 With the future of IT and ITeS lying in innovations, Karnik said the government should look into the recommendations of the Nitin Desai committee to encourage innovation and investment in the industry.

 ICICI set to wrap up yen loan deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New drive

 Mumbai, Sept. 3: ICICI Bank is set to raise an yen-equivalent loan of $1.5 billion (Rs 6,100 crore) from 10 foreign banks, the biggest offshore syndicated loan by a domestic financial institution. 

 A formal announcement from the countrys largest private sector bank is expected tomorrow. The funds will be used for general corporate purposes.

 The 10 banks mandated for funding include BNP Paribas, Calyon, Goldman Sachs, Standard Chartered Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui. 

 The loans range from one to three years. The one-year loan is being raised at 27 basis points above Libor (London interbank offered rate), the two-year one at 44 basis points above Libor and the three-year loan at 65 basis points above Libor.

 This exercise follows the banks follow-on public offer in domestic and international markets in June this year that fetched about Rs 10,000 crore.

 ICICI Bank had made the follow-on offer to meet capital adequacy norms and comply with Basel II norms which will come into effect from the next financial year.

 Basel II is a round of meetings by central bankers from around the world, in Basel, Switzerland, aimed at producing uniformity in the way banks and banking regulators approach risk management.

 When it announced the huge borrowing programme, the bank said Indian companies had lined up major investment plans that would create a huge demand for credit.

 The bank has estimated an investment of $500 billion in infrastructure and manufacturing.

 The bank is also offering its commercial banking products to global clients. It now has subsidiaries in the UK, Canada and Russia, and branches in Singapore, Dubai, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong and Bahrain.

 There are also representative offices in the US, China, the UAE, Bangladesh, South Africa, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.

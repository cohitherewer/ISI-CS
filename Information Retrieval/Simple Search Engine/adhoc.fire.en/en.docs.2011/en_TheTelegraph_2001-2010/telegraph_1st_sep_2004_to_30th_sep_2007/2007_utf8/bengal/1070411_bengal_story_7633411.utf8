 Falta (South 24-Parganas), April 10: Promises of payment and new jobs flew thick over the embers of Falta factories gutted in Mondays blaze.

 At least 10 fire engines and scores of fire fighters were still on their toes in the export processing zone, where an early-morning fire gutted factories that made a variety of items, from plastic granules to shoes to paper products. 

 As policemen cordoned off the area 80 km from Calcutta Aliza Khatoon, Sahera Khatoon, Sakir Bibi, Asmani Khatoon and Saleh Khatoon hung around. 

 The unskilled casual labourers in plastic units had trudged about 2 km from their homes in Kalatalahat village. They are among the 2,500 who have lost their jobs.

 Like yesterday, we came to our factories. We feel helpless and dont know what is in store, said Aliza, a 20-year-old girl who worked as a plastic sheet cutter. 

 They went back in the afternoon, having realised that there was no work.

 District magistrate Roshni Sen said she will soon submit a report on the fire to the state government. A preliminary report, by Diamond Harbour subdivisional officer Prabhas Biswas, has already been handed in. But Sen said more details are being collected. 

 A team of officials from the Union commerce and industry ministry visited the site today. 

 Fire services director D.P. Biswas said there was a need to call in forensic experts. District superintendent of police S.N. Gupta said such a request has already been made. 

 I hope the team will reach Falta in a day or two, Biswas added. 

 As the hunt for causes of the blaze continues, the fate of those left without work is uncertain. But local trade unions, affiliated to all mainline political parties, are already promising the workers jobs elsewhere in the zone.

 Nearly 2,500 workers, including those employed on a casual basis, have become jobless. We have talked to the authorities so that they can be given work in other units. The factory owners have made arrangements for payments due to them, said Tapas Mondal, a local Citu leader. 

 The Trinamul Congress was not far behind. Arumoy Gayen, the partys local leader, requested the subdivisional officer to ensure that the workers are not deprived of their dues, and that steps are taken to relocate them. 

 The inferno is the second setback in a month for SEZs in Bengal after the Nandigram violence forced the government to shelve plans for a chemical hub.

 Buddha in hurry to find non-farm land

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 15: With the acquisition row raging, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has asked the agriculture and land departments to find non-farm land suitable for industry at the earliest. 

 The departments have been asked to submit their reports in a month. 

 On the chief ministers instructions, our departments are rummaging through land-use records of the states 22,022 mouzas, agriculture minister Naren De said today. 

 Our report will contain information on land used for agricultural and non-agricultural activities in every mouza, he added.

 The first will be a preliminary report, providing a basic database to identify land for industries that require urgent consideration, the minister said.

 The land use board led by social scientist V.K. Ramchandran would prepare a land-use map providing information on every plot. 

 The agriculture commission, constituted by the government to study the status of agriculture and allied sectors in the state, held its first meeting today. 

 Our task is to prepare a vision 2020 for a holistic view and a sustainable development plan for agriculture and fields such as animal husbandry, fisheries, horticulture and agri-marketing, said the chairman of the commission, former Calcutta University vice-chancellor Rathindranath Basu. 

 With concern over diminishing cultivable tracts increasing, the commission has been told to find ways for more effective use of farmland and suggest ways to increase production and crop diversification.

 The government has asked it to submit its reports within six months. 

 The chief minister has written to authors, academics and activists in Delhi, who had earlier protested against his land acquisition policy, explaining the governments stand. Officials said the letter sent on Friday is a bid to counter the negative publicity resulting from the Nandigram violence.

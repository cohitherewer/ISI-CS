The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata rejects, govt still at it

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 24: The government today said Mamata Banerjees presence at the all-party meeting on the chemical hub was much desired, after she again ruled out attending it.

 The government will write to Mamata Banerjee, requesting her to attend the meeting. She is the leader of the principal Opposition party, and her participation is much desired, industries minister Nirupam Sen said.

 After a party meeting, Mamata said: The CPM-led government doesnt have any moral right to call the all-party meeting. The project will cause serious environmental hazards, but the government is not concerned. We are opposed to any chemical hub.

 Asked for a reaction, Sen said there is nothing new about it. Still we are writing to her, as we are doing to all other political parties. A consensus is necessary, he added. 

 After a cabinet huddle on Wednesday, the chief minister said the meeting on the hub will be held on September 3.

 Sources said Sen will talk to Trinamul Congress MLA and leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee soon to ensure the partys participation.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee declined comment on Mamatas decision.

 Ministers from Left Front partners like the CPI, RSP and the Forward Bloc had apparently requested Bhattacharjee to persuade the Trinamul leadership to attend the all-party meeting. If the principal Opposition party skips it, the meeting will lose its relevance, CPI minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya said. 

 Mamata cited another reason for skipping the all-party meet. The law-and-order situation in Nandigram and Khejuri is getting worse every day because of the CPM. Talks with the government should not be held at this juncture.

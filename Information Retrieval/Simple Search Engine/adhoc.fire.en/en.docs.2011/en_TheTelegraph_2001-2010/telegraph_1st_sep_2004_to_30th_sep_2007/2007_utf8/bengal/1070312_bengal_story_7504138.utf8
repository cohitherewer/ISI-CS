 Santiniketan waste plan

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bolpur, March 11: A Rs 80-crore waste management and drainage system will be built in Santiniketan, where the filth now accumulates either in soak pits or water bodies. 

 The Sriniketan-Santiniketan Development Authority will carry out the twin projects with central assistance and in collaboration with the Bolpur municipality, Visva-Bharati and the local panchayats.

 Forty-three villages of the Bolpur subdivision will ben- efit from these projects, said Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, the local MP and chairman of the authority.

 Asoke Das, its CEO, said there is no proper waste management and drainage system now. An IIT Kharagpur team has already submitted a plan to the authority.

 On a days visit to open a water works at Ratanpally, Chatterjee said the projects would make Santiniketan a healthier tourist destination.

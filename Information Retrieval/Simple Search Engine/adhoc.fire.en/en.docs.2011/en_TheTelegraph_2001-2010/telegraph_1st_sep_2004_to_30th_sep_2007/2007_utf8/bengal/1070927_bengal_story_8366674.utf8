The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Boat sinks in raging river

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 26: A boat with 20 

 people capsized in the turbulent Kuye in Birbhum as most 

 south Bengal rivers continued to be in spate, fed by torrential 

 rain from Saturday to Monday. 

 A dozen passengers swam to safety. Anima Thunder, 25, was not among them. She was found dead. 

 A search is on for the other passengers. We are using a trained rescue team, Birbhum district magistrate Tapan Kumar Shome said.

 The country boat laden with motorcycles, cycles and poultry besides people sank near Labhpur, about 220km from Calcutta. 

 I tried to save a man but he caught me in a tight embrace and pulled me under water. I struggled and freed myself. Or else I would also have drowned, said Bibek Ghosh, a La-bhpur sweet shop owner who was on the boat.

 The situation in Howrah, Hooghly and West Midnapore got worse today with heavy discharge from the Durgapur and Kangsabati barrages. 

 Six deaths were reported from Murshidabad, Birbhum and East Midnapore, taking the toll to 31 since Saturday.

 The government has ask-ed state-controlled reservoirs like Massanjore and Kangsa- bati and the DVC authorities to cut down the quantum of release. 

 More rain and release of water will spell disaster, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said at Writers Buildings.

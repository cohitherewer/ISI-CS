The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Student from Patna in JEE net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 11: A second-year MBBS student was detained in Patna today by Calcutta police in connection with the Joint Entrance Examination racket.

 Biswajit Kumar, 22, of Patna Medical College and Hospital, was a dummy candidate who had appeared for Avijit Saha and ranked 131. He is a resident of Sitamarhi district in Bihar.

 We are yet to ascertain how much Kumar was paid for the job, said Ajoy Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, detective department.

 He said Biswajits name had cropped up during the interrogation of other accused.

 Biswajit was contacted by Mihir Jha, one of the key members of the JEE entrance racket, two months before the examination, Kumar said.

 The police raided a hostel in Patna around 6 in the morning and picked Biswajit.

 The team of seven officers had searched several places to track Biswajit. They then received information that he was hiding in the hostel, said an officer.

 Biswajit was asleep when we raided the hostel. He tried to escape, but we did not give him any chance, Kumar said.

 He will be brought to the Lalbazar police headquarters late tonight and produced in court on Sunday.

 So far, 18 people have been arrested for involvement in the racket.

 The police are now on the lookout for two other dummy candidates who had appeared on behalf of Prosenjit Bhowmik, arrested at Moshat in Hooghly, and Kumar Singha Roy, arrested at Sonarpur in South 24-Parganas.

 Raid on Tapasi sleuth

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 23: The CBI today raided houses and offices belonging to its superintendent of police, accused of blackmailing suspects and extorting money from them.

 A team of 11 officers from the agencys vigilance wing spent more than 15 hours at the Beliaghata flat of A.K. Sahay, the SP (special crime) overseeing the probe into the murder of Singur land-acquisition protester Tapasi Malik.

 Some documents, including details of his bank account, investments and security deposits, were seized.

 Raids were also conducted at Sahays Salt Lake office, his ancestral home in Dhanbad and nine other places.

 G. Mohanty, a CBI spokesperson in Delhi, said a case had been registered against the SP for taking illegal gratification, criminal misconduct and obtaining pecuniary advantage by abusing official position.

 Sahay and his aides would extort money from accused or suspects in cases that his department was handling, he said.

 According to CBI sources, Sahay had appointed a person, who would be handed over a list of names. The agent would contact them and threaten them, saying if they did not pay up, false evidence would be produced in court against them, an official said.

 According to CBI officials, the raid is the first in recent months in which the agency has put one of its senior officers under the scanner.

 The vigilance team reached Sahays flat on Raja Rajendralal Mitra Road around 6.30 this morning. They locked the main door and started interrogating the officer. The raid continued till late tonight, said a CBI official.

 Reports against Sahay had reached the CBIs Delhi headquarters a couple of months ago. Since then, a secret probe was going on. A case was registered on August 21, an officer said.

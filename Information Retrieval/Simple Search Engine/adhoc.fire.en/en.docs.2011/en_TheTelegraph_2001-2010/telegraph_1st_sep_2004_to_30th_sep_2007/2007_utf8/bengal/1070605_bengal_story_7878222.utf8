 Pillow play kills spouse

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Raiganj, June 4: A man playfully smothered his wife to death with a pillow in North Dinajpur yesterday.

 Gourhari Roy, a farm labourer in Rupahar, told police today that his wife of four years, with whom he has a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter and a three-week-old son, did not want another child for the next five years.

 He told her playfully that he would kill her if she refused. When Radha retorted he would not have the heart to do it, he decided to show her in jest that he could, the officer-in-charge of Raiganj police station, Pradip Chakrabarty, said.

 Gourhari then took a pillow and smothered her with it and she choked to death.

 He thought Radha had lost consciousness and called neighbours. We called a doctor, who declared her dead, a neighbour said. Gourhari was handed over to the police and charged with murder. 

 The neighbours, however, said they did not know of any tension between the couple.

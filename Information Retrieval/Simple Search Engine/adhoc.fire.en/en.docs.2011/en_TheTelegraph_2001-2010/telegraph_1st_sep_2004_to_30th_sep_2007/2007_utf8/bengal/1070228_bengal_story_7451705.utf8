 Governor rap

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Darjeeling, Feb. 27: Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi to- day went to see the garbage dumping site where a 10-year-old girl is feared to have been buried in an avalanche of trash.

 A posse of senior officials, too, came rushing before, during and after his visit. Only a handful of police and fire brigade personnel were trying to locate the girl yesterday.

 The garbage is thrown down the hill... to nowhere, Gopal Krishna said, in disbelief. Tell me, is this scientific? he asked municipality vice-chairman B.M. Limboo and district magistrate Rajesh Pandey.

 Sushmita Sarki was under the chute moments before the garbage came crashing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Haldia status quo offer

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Chatterjee:Tight lipped 

 Calcutta, Feb. 12: The government is ready 

 to continue with Purnendu Chatterjee as a partner in Haldia 

 Petrochemical Ltd (HPL), though it has made a buy-or-sell 

 offer to him before the Company Law Board.

 The government wants HPL to remain a professionally-managed company with no partner calling the shots.

 Writers Buildings has told Purnendu it has no problem with The Chatterjee Group (TCG) if status quo is maintained and the proposals of the corporate debt restructuring package implemented. 

 In other words, TCG has to give up its desire to take management control of HPL. And accept stake sale to Indian Oil Corporation and financial institutions like IDBI. 

 Finally, HPL has to make an initial public offer (IPO) to list the company in market.

 I have no problem with TCG in HPL. But let it be a professionally-run company, industries minister Nirupam Sen told The Telegraph today.

 TCG has not responded to the governments offer yet.

 The government had said something different before the law board, where it is fighting for control of HPL with Purnendu TCG or the government should buy out the other completely as it is difficult to co-habit.

 The boards January 31 ruling endorsed the view. It said that government should exit HPL by selling its stake to Purnendu. In case TCG fails to pay, the state can buy it out.

 The government is mulling whether to appeal against the order, which said it should transfer shares worth Rs 155 crore to TCG, giving it management control of HPL.

 The government does not want to be a shareholder with TCG running the show.

 Sen said the company is doing well and has expansion plans. An IPO can be used to raise funds. Once listed, it becomes accountable to a lot more people shareholders and market regulator Sebi.

 Former CII director-general Tarun Das is the HPL chairman and Purnendu vice-chairman. Industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen is a member on the board with the WBIDC managing director.

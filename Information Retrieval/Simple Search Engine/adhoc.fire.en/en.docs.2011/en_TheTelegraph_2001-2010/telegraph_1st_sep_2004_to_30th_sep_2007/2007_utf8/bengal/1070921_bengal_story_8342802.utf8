 Malda, Sept. 20: A constable of the National Volunteer Force was nearly lynched after he was caught allegedly trying to rape a woman inside a police camp on the Malda district hospital campus this morning.

 Police later rescued Piyari Mahato and got him admitted to the hospital, where doctors said his condition was serious.

 Malda superintendent of police Dilip Mondol, who visited the spot, said he feared that the constable might not live. He suffered severe head injuries. The men who beat him up have been identified. They will not be spared, Mondol added.

 Mahato has been booked for attempted rape. A case has been initiated against the mob for the assault on the constable and for damaging public property. 

 The 50-year-old woman was a regular at the hospital for the past two months as she would visit her daily labourer husband. 

 Witnesses said around 5.30am, the woman was brushing her teeth near the police camp on the hospital campus, when Mahato came from behind and lifted her off her feet. Before she could react, he had taken her inside the camp and locked the door. 

 The few people who were awake were too shocked to react. Soon, the woman started screaming for help. Within minutes, a mob of 200 assembled and they broke open the door to find the woman struggling to free herself. They beat up Mahato, who was reportedly drunk. 

 Two hours later, a force arrived from Englishbazar. The woman said Mahato, in his early fifties, had misbehaved with her earlier. When he caught me from behind, I was too terrified to react. I began screaming when he bolted the door and started groping me.

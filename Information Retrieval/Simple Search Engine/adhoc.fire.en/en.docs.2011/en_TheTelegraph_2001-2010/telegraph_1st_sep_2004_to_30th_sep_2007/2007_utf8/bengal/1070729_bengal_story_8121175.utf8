The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Teachers in salwar protest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 28: Eight teachers of Bakhrahat Girls High School today decided to wear the salwar-kameez to work instead of the sari next week. 

 Heckled and threatened with public humiliation for protesting against the salwar-kameez ban, they went to Bishnupur police station yesterday. 

 Tomorrow is a holiday. So we will come in salwar-kameez from Tuesday or Wednesday. We dont think it will spoil the school environment, said one of the teachers. 

 The school has 30 teachers, but eight stood up against the ban, illegal as the government has made it clear that no such restriction can be imposed.

 The decision to wear salwar-kameezes followed a meeting between the schools teachers and non-teaching staff. 

 Headmistress Saswati Das refused to comment when asked about the decision. This is an internal matter, she said. 

 School secretary Anup Ghosh has convened a meeting of guardians and teachers to discuss the impasse over the dress code on August 3. We have to adjust with the times. We have no problem if teachers wear the salwar-kameez instead of the sari, he added.

 Ghosh has asked the police to ensure that outsiders dont meddle in the matter.

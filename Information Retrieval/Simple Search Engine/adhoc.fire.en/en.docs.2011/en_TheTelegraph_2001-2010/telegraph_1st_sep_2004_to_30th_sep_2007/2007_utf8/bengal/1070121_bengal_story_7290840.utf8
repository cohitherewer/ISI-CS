The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Widow held for Rs 60-lakh bank fraud

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 20: A 52-year-old widow was arrested from her Behala home today for allegedly swindling the BBD Bag branch of a private bank out of nearly Rs 60 lakh. 

 A detective department officer said Mala Roy sold her husbands property and cheated her sister-in-law by forging her signature. 

 Malas sister-in-law Seema Roy is also a widow. They were joint holders of their husbands property, the officer said.

 Some seven months ago, Mala opened a bank account in Seemas name but provided her photograph instead of her sister-in-laws. She also submitted several cheques in Seemas name. 

 Then she withdrew nearly Rs 60 lakh from the bank over the past five months, the officer added. 

 Seema, who stays in the US, returned to the city three months ago and realised that she had been cheated. 

 The woman, who has a house on CR Avenue, lodged a complaint with the Hare Street police station about two months ago. The case was later taken over by the anti-cheating section of the detective department. 

 On her return to the city, Seema came to know that Mala had sold off properties by forging her signature and had even encashed cheques issued in her name by opening the new account, an officer said.

 During questioning in her Behala house, Mala initially denied having opened the account in her sister-in-laws name. She has confessed to her guilt after several contradictory statements, the officer added. 

 Manoj Verma, a detective department deputy commissioner, said an investigation has been launched to ascertain the exact amount of money withdrawn from the bank. We have also asked the bank to provide us all documents concerning Malas transactions. The role of some of the bank employees would also be probed, he added.

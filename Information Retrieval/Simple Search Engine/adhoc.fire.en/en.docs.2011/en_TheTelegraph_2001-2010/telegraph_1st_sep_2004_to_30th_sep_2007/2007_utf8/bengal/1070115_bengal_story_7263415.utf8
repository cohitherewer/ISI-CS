The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Flare-up could be avoided, says Biman

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Sutahata, Jan. 14: The gunfight in Nandigram last week would not have occurred had local party leaders been cautious, state CPM secretary Biman Bose said today. 

 We cannot disown our responsibility. If our activists and leaders were cautious, last Sundays tragedy could have been averted, Bose told the partys East Midnapore district committee here, about 120 km from Calcutta.

 Villagers clashed over land acquisition for a special economic zone and a string of other projects in Nandigram last week, killing seven people.

 Accompanied by health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, who hails from Narayangarh in West Midnapore, Bose came here to review the situation with the partys grassroots members. Lakshman Seth, the controversial Tamluk MP whose haste was held responsible for the gun battle, was also present at the meeting.

 Seth, also chairman of the Haldia Development Authority, who was censured by the chief minister yesterday for issuing a notice identifying 29 mouzas in Nandigram and Khejuri blocks for acquisition, again came under flak today.

 Bose said the party should strengthen its campaign at the grassroots to counter the false propaganda by the Trinamul Congress-led front against the governments industrialisation drive.

 Abu Taher, a Trinamul leader and convener of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee, said it will take some time to begin the repair of dug-up roads as the people are still tense and fear CPM attacks. However, the committee held a public meeting today to convince villagers that the repairs were part of the peace process.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Jamait wary of Left

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 10: The Jamait Ulema-i-Hind today said the proposed all-party meeting on Nandigram should be called by the governor instead of the Forward Bloc secretary as the Left would try to prevent discussions on the March 14 firing.

 Jamait general secretary Siddiqullah Chowdhury told a public meeting: The governor is the appropriate neutral authority to call an all-party meeting. Ashokbabu is a senior leader but he is from the Left. He will obviously try to prevent a discussion on the Nandigram killings as the CPM would not want it.

 He did not rule out participation in the proposed meeting if invited but said he would have to discuss it with the organisations leaders.

 Chowdhury claimed that his organisation was still part of the Bhoomi Uchched Pratirodh Committee.

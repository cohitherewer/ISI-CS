The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Seth tempers peace hope

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 17: Lakshman Seth, the CPM MP from Tamluk and chairman of the Haldia Development Authority, today ruled out any chance of immediate peace in Nandigram despite party patriarch Jyoti Basus efforts.

 We have to honour the efforts that Jyotibabu has taken for peace by speaking to Mamatadi (Banerjee). The bloodshed should be stopped. However, it wont stop soon as all reactionary forces have ganged up against us, Seth said after attending a CPM meeting on panchayats at the party headquarters.

 He indicated that the CPM and the government would prefer to wait and watch rather than think of a police crackdown to end the stalemate in Nandigram, in view of the forthcoming municipal polls in adjoining port city of Haldia. 

 The MP, known for his strong-arm tactics, today stressed that the land for a chemical hub in Haldia, originally planned in Nandigram, would be acquired without bloodshed and tears.

 The state government has urged for political consensus on the hub. We never acquired land for industry forcibly and offered adequate compensation to farmers, Seth said.

 Panchayat drive

 Sight sets on next years panchayat polls, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today met CPM leaders to take stock of the progress made in rural development projects. 

 In the backdrop of the land war, which the Opposition is sure to make a major plank in the polls, the government has decided to keep panchayats out of the controversy. Panchayats have no business in land acquisition for industry, said Benoy Konar, who presided over the meeting. 

 Instead, the meeting focused on the need to expedite the process of distribution of vested land to the landless and on the involvement of the poor in the development of backward regions.

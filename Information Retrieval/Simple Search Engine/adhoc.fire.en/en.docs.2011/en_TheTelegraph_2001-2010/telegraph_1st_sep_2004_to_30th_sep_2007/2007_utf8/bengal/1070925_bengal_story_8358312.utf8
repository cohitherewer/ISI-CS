 6300-acre acquisition on cabinet table

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Sept. 24: The cabinet will take up for clearance the acquisition of more than 6,300 acres for a slew of projects and the proposed chemical hub in Nayachar at its meeting tomorrow.

 Among the plans on the table is a township at Domjur in Howrah that requires 795 acres. 

 The project, which will bring in investment worth Rs 550 crore, will be executed on a public-private partnership model. The government has already identified infertile and low-lying land spread over six mouzas for the project. 

 The proposal had come up on April 12 but chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee deferred a decision apparently because urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya was not present at the meeting. Officials said the government had actually wanted to go slow on acquisition in the wake of the March 14 police firing in Nandigram.

 Nayachar doesnt figure on the agenda this time but officials said the chief minister was expected to raise the plan for discussion.

 Another plan up for approval will be that of Videocon Group, which has lined up a 3-million tonne cold-rolled steel mill at Baraboni near Asansol. A 1200MW captive power plant will be part of the project.

 The project will be worth Rs 15,000 crore and will require around 2,500 acres.

 The cabinet will also consider a proposal by Shyam Steel Industries to set up a TMT bar unit over 1,850 acres at Raghunathpur in Purulia.

 A thermal plant planned by the Power Development Corporation at Katwa in Burdwan is also on the agenda. 

 For this, the cabinet will have to clear the acquisition of 1,030 acres.

 The state requires another 135 acres at Nimtouri, where it plans to shift the East Midnapore district headquarters from Tamluk town.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 ATM to pump in fake notes

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, May 27: A duo who allegedly used to deposit fake notes in ATMs was picked up today in a swoop by Maharashtra and Bengal police.

 Saifuddin Mondal and Mohammed Masiha, who were held at home in North 24-Par-ganas Bongaon, were apparently linked with two Bangladeshis arrested in Aurangabad on May 18.

 The police said Saifuddin had an account at the Habra about 80 km from Calcutta branch of a private bank.

 He used to deposit fake notes at the ATM and withdraw genuine ones. It was not very difficult for him to open an account as he was an Indian, an officer said.

 The arrests, police believe, will help them bust a fake currency racket spread across India.

 Abdul Motleb and Abdul Hafiz, who were caught in Maharashtra, also apparently deposited fake notes in Saifuddins name at ATMs of various banks. They spilled the beans about their Bengal associates during interrogation.

 Motleb has visited India 15 times in the past year and stayed in different parts of the country, the police said.

 Saifuddin and Masiha were produced in a court here today. Maharashtra police will take them away tomorrow.

 They had sought our help to conduct a joint raid. We are trying to find out whether the racket had other conduits here, North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Pranab piles heat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, July 1: On Bidhan Roys birthday, Pranab Mukherjee gave the CPM a sermon on industrialisation. 

 Its good that the Left has belatedly realised the importance of the late Bidhan Chandra Roy. But had it followed his path earlier, the present turmoil could have been avoided, the Congress leader said, alluding to the Marxists decision to observe Peace Day today.

 According to Mukherjee, Roy did not face any problem in his industrialisation drive because of his meticulous and systematic planning. 

 But the present governments initiative has been hasty, he said.

 The government here is going ahead with industrialisation without caring about agriculture. This is not expected, the external affairs minister added.

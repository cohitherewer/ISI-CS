 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Feb. 11: Mamata Banerjee will address a rally at Bhojerhat near Bhangar in South 24-Parganas tomorrow in protest against possible land acqui-sition there. 

 A slice of Bhangar, about 25 km from Calcutta, is slated to be taken over for an expressway spanning the two 24-Parganas. A larger chunk is required in Baruipur, 20 km from Bhangar, for a new district headquarters and a township.

 Behrampore: Congress Das, 50, was allegedly hacked to death by his nephew while working in his mustard field in Murshidabads Suti. Police said it was the result of a fight over a plot in the village, about 275 km from Calcutta.

 Darjeeling: Toongsoong, a locality in the hill town, has ordered the registration of all outsiders after a daily labourer allegedly raped an eight-year-old. Tourists and guests would be spared but everyone else has to get registered with a local body. Police have welcomed the move.

 Calcutta: The Calcutta Port Trust Officers Wives Association felicitated Rabindrasangeet singer Suchitra Mitra.

 Krishnagar: Ishita Biswas, 32, a housewife, burned to death in the town, 85 km from Cal- cutta, on Saturday night. Neighbours beat up her husband, who was accused of murder.

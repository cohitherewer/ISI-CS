 Krishnagar, March 12: The CPM leadership in Nadia has found that around 11,000 activists have left the partys womens wing in search of jobs to other states in the past 10 years. Of them, about 400 have not been heard of since.

 The district party leadership has admitted that the 400-odd activists have fallen prey to human trafficking and forced into the flesh trade.

 We have come to know that nearly 400 women activists of our party have been sold to the flesh trade. Most of these cases were registered with the police. We were surprised when we stumbled upon the information, said Rama Biswas, district secretary of the CPM womens wing, Ganatantrik Mahila Samity, and Nadia sabhadhipati.

 About the other women, Rama said many of them maintain contact with their families. Many poor women were forced to take up jobs outside Bengal. But we were kept in the dark, she said.

 Explaining how the party stumbled upon the information, Biswas said that while scrutinising the drop in membership, it was found that in 2004, the womens wing registered a membership of 2.4 lakh but in 2005, the number decreased to 2.3 lakh. In 2006, the number went up marginally.

 In Nadia, there are about 15 lakh women who are above 18 years of age and, it was found that the womens wing has been able to reach a very small portion of them.

 While carrying out a study to find out the reasons behind poor enrolment, we found out how our activists have left the organisation in search of two square meals a day, said the Nadia womens wing chief of the party.

 Nazira Khatun, a former member of the Ganatantrik Mahila Samity from Dogachi in Karimpur went to Delhi after middlemen promised her a maids job in hotels 10 years ago. She was 25 and managed to get a job in a hotel. But after calling up a couple of times, she stopped contacting her father Atur Sheikh and her five brothers and sisters.

 I could not provide enough food as I earn a meagre sum as a daily labourer. The Mahila Samity, too, could not get her a job. We dont know where she is now, said Sheikh.

 Reena Biswas of Bagula in Hanskhali, about 70 km from Calcutta, was an active samity member 10 years ago, attending processions and meetings.

 She got married when she was 21. As her labourer husband was an alcoholic and did not have a regular income, she fell for the lure of a good job in Mumbai. 

 Five years ago, she called me up and was weeping. I asked her what she does but she did not reveal anything, said her father Kesto Biswas, a daily-wage labourer.

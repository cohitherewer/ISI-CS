 Trinamul rampage

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Feb. 17: Trinamul Congress activists clashed with CPM supporters in Khejuri near Nandigram, set ablaze over a dozen houses and ransacked many others early this morning.

 Police said the trouble started when about a hundred Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee members armed with pipeguns, sticks and rods tried to enter Tekhali from Sonachura to set a CPM camp on fire. 

 The CPM supporters forced them to retreat. On the way back, the Trinamul mob set at least 14 houses on fire and looted and ransacked 11 others at Gokulnagar. 

 They smashed doors, windows, tiled roofs and furniture and looted valuables and foodgrain, the police said. The mob also dug up two roads leading to Gokulnagar. 

 Midnapore range DIG N. Ramesh Babu said Eastern Frontier Rifles and Rapid Action Force jawans have been deployed but no one has been held.

 Politburo meeting

 The CPM state committee has given a note to the politburo on Nandigram and special economic zones. The politburo will discuss the issues tomorrow.

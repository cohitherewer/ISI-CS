 Power crisis

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Feb. 24: Power minister Mrinal Banerjee today warned of massive power cuts this summer in the areas covered by the state electricity board.

 We had to hire an additional 400 MW of power from the Damodar Valley Corporation after a sudden breakdown in the Kolaghat thermal power plant today, Banerjee said after he got the news on his cellphone in the middle of his address to a workshop here.

 This kind of a breakdown may occur anytime in any plant in the state because of old infrastructure and machinery, he said. But for the Madhyamik examination, we have to expedite additional supply.

 Banerjee later said the state would generate an additional 1,570 MW by March and is also expecting at least 450 MW from the Purulia hydel power unit by December-end.

 So, the state will have to wait till winter for a comfortable power scenario.

 Banerjee said: The municipalities are likely to generate power from non-bio degradable waste... and these would help better utilisation of renewable energy.

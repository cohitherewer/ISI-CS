Cooch Behar, Aug. 13: The roof of a cold storage came crashing today, killing a labourer and injuring 11 others engaged to reduce its height and ensure safe landing at the soon-to-be-reopened airport here.

 The dead has been identified as 35-year-old Solomon Miyan. Two contractors, who were in charge of the demolition, have been arrested. 

 The incident at Chakchaka, 7km from here, has come as a damper to the festive spirit of the town awaiting the resumption of commercial flights within a month.

 After the Airports Authority of India asked the district administration to reduce the height of the 62ft building by 18.5ft, the PWD was engaged to carry out the work.

 The demolition started on August 1, district planning officer Sunil Agarwal said.

 Around 150 labourers had chipped off the concrete from the steel mesh of the ceiling. Twenty of them were sawing off a pillar, which gave way. A dozen workers fell 40ft below, a witness said.

 The condition of five was said to be very serious.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Rape slur returns to haunt CPM

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Feb. 20: A CPM panchayat leader has been accused of raping a mother of three.

 Police said Bishnu Mondal is absconding. 

 Mondal entered the womans house at Birpur in Nakashipara, 130 km from Calcutta, on Saturday morning and attacked her.

 We have started a rape case, but Mondal is absconding. The woman has been sent for medical examination, the inspector in charge of the local police station said.

 Only last week, Arun Ghosh, a CPM zonal committee member from Sonarpur in South 24-Parganas, 25 km from Calcutta, was accused of raping a widow repeatedly taking advantage of her plight. Ghosh is still missing and the police are apparently clueless about where he could be hiding. 

 The woman Mondal allegedly raped went to his house with her husband on Sunday. 

 Mondals wife slapped her and threatened her with dire consequences if she dared to lodge a police complaint, the officer said.

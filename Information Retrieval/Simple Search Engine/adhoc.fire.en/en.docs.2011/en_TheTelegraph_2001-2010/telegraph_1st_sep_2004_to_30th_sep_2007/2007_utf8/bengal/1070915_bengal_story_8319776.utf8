The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Students allege mass ragging

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Sept. 14: Fourteen first-year students, who had had enough of stripping in front of seniors, doing sit-ups and touching their feet, have filed a police complaint against them.

 Police raided the Kandi Raj College hostel for eight second and three third year-students last night. They were missing.

 Every night, we were asked to do sit-ups at least a hundred times and touch their feet. We were forced to dance in our underwear. If we disobeyed them, they beat us up with sticks and made us write indecent things about our families, a first-year student said. 

 The hostel with 60 students does not have a full-time su- perintendent. Indrajit Das, a non-teaching employee, is in charge. He declined comment.

 The college tried to play down the charge. They were hurt by the seniors jokes. It was not ragging, principal Rashbehari Sinha said.

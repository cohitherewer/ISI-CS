 Tutors in the dock after slap

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 15: The mother of a Class V girl of a reputable south Calcutta school today lodged a police complaint against two teachers of a coaching centre who allegedly slapped the child repeatedly.

 Mohua Das told police that her daughter had failed to answer questions at the tutorial on Ramani Chatterjee Street where she went for classes. The child returned to her grandfathers house nearby at noon and broke down. 

 The complaint mentions two aunties and we will take appropriate action against them after an inquiry, a Gariahat police officer said. 

 Days after school education minister Partha De said the government would pre- pare a plan to stop corporal punishment, three students in Nadia, Murshidabad and South 24-Parganas were also beaten up by their teachers.

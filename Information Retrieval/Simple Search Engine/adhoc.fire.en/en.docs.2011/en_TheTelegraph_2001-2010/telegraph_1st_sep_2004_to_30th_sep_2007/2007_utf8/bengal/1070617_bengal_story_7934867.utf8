 Driven out to the road

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI 

 Nandigram, June 16: From home to hell, Kalpana Mondal made the journey in a few hours.

 The 39-year-old and her husband Sampada had fled to a nearby road yesterday when Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee (BUPC) supporters ransacked their house in Ranichowk village. But when they reached there, the couple realised their three children were missing.

 They got to know this morning that their daughter had taken shelter in a relatives house nearby. But there is still no news of their two sons. 

 Kalpana and Sampada were joined by hordes of villagers who had fled their homes and refugee camps and taken shelter under the sky. 

 We spent the whole night on the road awaiting the return of our children, Kalpana sobbed. 

 Outsiders from both sides have made life hell for us. We do not need any party but want to live in peace, said Shankar Das, a fellow villager. 

 About 100 armed BUPC supporters had entered Ranichowk around 2 pm yesterday and fired indiscriminately. They ransacked over 20 houses and set the refugee camp on fire. 

 The refugees living in CPM camps have been rendered homeless a second time. We lost our homes five months back and have been staying in the refugee camp. Where will we go now? asked Sabita Mondal, a resident of Satengabari. 

 Sheela Raut had a narrow escape when a bullet missed her head as she was fleeing the Bhangabera camp . How long will we keep on running from one place to another? she asked, sitting at the Burotolla CPM office with her husband and two children aged 7 and 10.

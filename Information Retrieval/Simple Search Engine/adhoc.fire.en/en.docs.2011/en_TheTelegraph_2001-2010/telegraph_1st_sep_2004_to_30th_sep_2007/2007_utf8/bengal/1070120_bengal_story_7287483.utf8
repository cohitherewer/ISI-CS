The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Jan. 19: Fake blood-kit scam accused Govind Sarda and Anand Mallu, an employee of Monozyme India Limited, were today granted bail.

 The high court granted the bail after going through a report on sample kits sent to the National Institute of Biologicals in Noida for tests. The report said the kits were standard and not fake. 

 Durgapur: Mohammad Ittefaq, 45, an employee of the Indian Iron and Steel Company in Burnpur, was seriously injured on Friday when a blaze broke out near a defunct tubewell at Dharampur in Asansol, about 250 km from Calcutta. Fire brigade officials said Ittefaq was engulfed in flames when he lit a cigarette. Inflammable gas may have risen from underground through the tubewell, an official said.

 Calcutta: The Trinamul Congress said on Friday that the government had misled people by saying that consent from land owners had been received to take over 960 acres in Singur, claiming that the process began only in the second week of this month.

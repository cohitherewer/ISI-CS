 Calcutta, May 19: Mamata Banerjee today described her one-to-one meeting with Forward Bloc secretary Ashok Ghosh as a turning point in Bengal politics.

 Sitting next to her, Ghosh smiled in agreement. 

 The Trinamul Congress chief today sprang a surprise on the CPM partner when she landed up at the Blocs Chittaranjan Avenue headquarters her first visit to a Left Front partners office. 

 Mamata and Ghosh spoke about the agenda for the all-party meeting on Nandigram to be held on Thursday. Both agreed that all aspects, including the March 14 police firing, would be discussed with an open mind. 

 Todays one-to-one meeting with Ashokda has really marked a turning point in Bengal politics, Mamata said at a joint news conference with Ghosh at the Bloc office. 

 The front leader echoed her. I, too, believe its a turning point and we should have initiated a dialogue with Mamata much earlier, Ghosh said.

 Mamata said she did not have any qualms about going the extra mile to meet a partner of her arch-rival CPM as both had peace on their minds.

 I was happy to step into the office of a front ally as the objective was to hold a peace talk. We have no political or ideological differences when the issue is restoration of peace. I am grateful to Ashokda for taking the initiative, she added. 

 Mamata said she had always attached a lot of importance to minor front partners. Arent front partners human beings? They can play a major role in ushering in peace in Nandigram.

 Todays meeting has been a turning point for front allies in another sense as well. This is the first time that a minor front ally has been assigned an important job and it has done it well. The Blocs achievement also comes a day after the CPM rejected a draft resolution prepared by its allies for the all-party meeting. 

 We may be small compared with the CPM but sometimes we can take the initiative to resolve a crisis if needed, said Kshiti Goswami of the RSP, another front partner. 

 Goswami, too, wants a date with the Trinamul boss. I have decided to start a dialogue with Mamata shortly to clear encroachment from National Highway 34 for its widening. I have already sent feelers to her through a key Trinamul functionary, he said.

 CPM secretariat member Benoy Konar said the CPM had no problem in sharing responsibilities with minor partners. All allies are equally important. The CPM alone cannot do everything, he said.

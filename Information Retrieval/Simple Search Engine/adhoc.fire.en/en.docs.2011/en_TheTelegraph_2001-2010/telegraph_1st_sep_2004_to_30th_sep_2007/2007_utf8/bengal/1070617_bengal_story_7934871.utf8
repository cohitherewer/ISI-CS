The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bankura pill for unity

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, June 16: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said all political parties should come together for industrialisation and cited a Bankura model for unity.

 I request all parties in the Opposition to forget political rivalries and join hands to allow industry to flourish in the state. Please dont resist or oppose moves to set up industry, the chief minister said after laying the foundation stone for an 11-acre industrial estate in Behrampore.

 All parties in Bankura have sent a signed letter to me, expressing willingness to have industry there. That makes me hopeful, and I am going to meet them on Monday. 

 Bhattacharjees next stop was Rejinagar in Murshidabad, 165 km from Calcutta, where he laid the foundation stone for another industrial estate.

 The government would have to take industry initiatives not only in Calcutta, Howrah and Hooghly but in other districts as well, he said. Our target is to set up industry in all districts of Bengal depending on the facilities available. 

 West Bengal Small Industries Development Corporation Ltd will set up the Rejinagar estate on 186 acres. It will have a jute park and silk and leather factories.

 Apart from Murshidabad, industries are also coming up in Siliguri, Coochbehar, and Malda. While mango factories will be set up in Malda, tanneries will come up in North Dinajpur. People there will be given training so that they can be employed in the factories, the chief minister said. 

 The Congress zilla parishad sabhadhipati, Siddika Begum, who was present at the programme, voiced her support for Bhattacharjees drive. All of us, irrespective of the parties we belong to, will have to come forward to make this a success, she said.

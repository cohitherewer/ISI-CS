 HM strikers reject truce

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, April 23: The Hindustan Motors management today set terms for reopening the Uttarpara factory but the striking unions rejected the offer. 

 The management issued a notice saying it would consider lifting the suspension of work in phases if the workers restored peace at the plant within 72 hours and gave individual assurances to let willing employees join their shift and allow transport of materials from the factory.

 The Sangrami Shramik Karmachari Union called the notice an insult. Union chief Amitava Bhattacharya said the employees and their families would march to Writers Buildings on April 27 demanding the chief ministers intervention.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, however, ruled out his intervention and said those assigned to deal with the matter were looking into it.

 The union had begun the strike on March 13 demanding payment of the December-January salary arrears, an end to the six-year DA freeze and lifting of the suspension on 42 workers chargesheeted for assaulting management employees.

 The company has already settled the salary arrears. Today, the union chief met labour secretary Subesh Das and added another condition: 242 casual workers must be given permanent jobs.

 He said the demand was part of the pact between the management and Citu in 2000.

 The management sent copies of its notice to the labour department. Executive vice-president Moloy Chaudhury, who met chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, said: We are helpless if the union places new demands every day.

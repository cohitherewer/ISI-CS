 Lover boy bail

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 14: The high court today granted bail to a 17-year-old boy arrested from a Digha hotel on the charge of abducting a girl of his age.

 The courts decision came after the girl told the judges that she loved the boy since childhood and the two had decided to marry.

 The court refused to accept the proposal of the government lawyer that the case be sent to the Juvenile Justice Board as the boy was a minor.

 Commenting on the order, advocate Jayant Narayan Chatterjee said: Sometimes justice is made from the core of the heart and not by the law.

 The teenagers, both Class XII students at a school in East Midnapores Haldia, were traced to a hotel in Digha on June 2 this year following a complaint lodged by the girls father on May 25.

 They were produced before the chief judicial magistrate, Haldia, who released the girl but sent the boy to police custody.

 The boys parents moved the high court against the order. They told the court that they knew about the affair and would get the boy and the girl married when they became adults.

 Slogans, shoes amp; brooms in court

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Chandernagore, June 29: Armed with shoes and brooms, thousands of Trinamul Congress and SUCI supporters today laid siege to the Chandernagore court where Suhrid Dutta and Debu Malik were brought for trial. 

 As soon as four cars carrying the two men and a dozen CBI officers reached the court around 10.40 am, the protesters went into a frenzy.

 Those involved in Tapasi Maliks murder must be hanged to death. Give the culprits exemplary punishment, they shouted as they crowded around the cars. 

 Some SUCI supporters began throwing shoes at the Tata Sumo carrying Suhrid. Amader haate ashamider tule din (Hand over the culprits to us), cried one of them. 

 Police, however, managed to clear the way for Suhrid and Debu. Half a dozen CPM leaders, including local MLA Ratan Banerjee, were among those present in the court.

 Around noon, the CBI sought the magistrates permission to take the duo to its Salt Lake office. But the protesters waiting outside would not let the cars out of the court gate.

 They hurled brickbats at the vehicles, shattering their glass panes. Amit Roy, the Trinamul Hooghly secretary, jumped on to the bonnet of one of the cars and began dancing.

 Soon, a CPM procession arrived near the court. The additional superintendent of police (headquarters), Asit Paul, was allegedly thrashed by some CPM men when he tried to stop the procession. 

 The police then resorted to lathicharge. In the melee, the dancing Trinamul leader fractured his right hand.

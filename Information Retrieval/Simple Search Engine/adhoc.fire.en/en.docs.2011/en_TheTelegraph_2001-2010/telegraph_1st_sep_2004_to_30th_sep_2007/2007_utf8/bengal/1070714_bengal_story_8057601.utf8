The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Party to sue CBI

 Calcutta, July 13: The chief minister had called the CBI, but the CPM is going to sue it for allegedly violating the rights of Singur leader Suhrid Dutta, reports our special correspondent. 

 The counsel for Dutta, who has been charged with masterminding the murder of teen anti-land acquisition activist Tapasi Malik, will file the case in Delhi High Court on Monday.

 Our party is ensuring the best legal fight for Dutta as it is an attack on our party, said Anil Basu, the MP from Arambagh. The Patiala House court has already rebuffed the CBI for conducting a polygraph test on Dutta without his permission. The magistrates observations will strengthen our case. 

 The chief minister had announced a CBI probe soon after murder on December 18. 

 Emerging from a party state secretariat meeting, Jyoti Basu today said the chief minister conceded to the Opposition demand, though the CBI is used to settle political scores. Now we have to fight the CBI in court and defend our leader.

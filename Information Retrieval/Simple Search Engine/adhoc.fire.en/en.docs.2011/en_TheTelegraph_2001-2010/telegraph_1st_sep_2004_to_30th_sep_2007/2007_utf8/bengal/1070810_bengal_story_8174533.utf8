 Burdwan, Aug. 9: Residents of a Burdwan village today locked up a school headmaster for allegedly molesting a Class VI student.

 Around 10am, about 25 villagers accompanied the girls widowed mother Manabi Ghosh to the Bankapasi Primary School in Mangalkot, about 170km from Calcutta.

 They marched into headmaster Moitar Rahmans office and rained abuses on him. They pushed him into a classroom along with six teachers who had spoken up for Rahman and locked the door.

 Soon the crowd swelled, and nearly 300 villagers formed a human wall outside the school for four hours. A police team arrived and the protesters were pacified only after the headmasters arrest.

 According to the police, Rahman had called the 12-year-old girl to his office during lunch break on Tuesday and molested her. 

 My daughter was very depressed and was not eating properly. She told me everything yesterday, Manabi said.

 The headmaster said he had been framed.

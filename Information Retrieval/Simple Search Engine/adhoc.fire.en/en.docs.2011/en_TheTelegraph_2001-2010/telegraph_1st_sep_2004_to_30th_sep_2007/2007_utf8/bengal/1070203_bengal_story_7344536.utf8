The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Ex-minister buddy held for fraud

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 2: Goutam Das sat next to then railway minister Nitish Kumar on the dais during a programme at Dakshineswar station in 2002. 

 Since then, he used his one brush with the former railway boss to promise young people jobs and duping them of lakhs.

 Das was picked up from his house at Ichhapore in North 24-Parganas on January 27. Police found Rs 9.75 lakh on him. 

 He allegedly took Rs 75,000 each from over 50 youths, some of whom went to police. 

 In 2002, Das had introduced himself as a retired air force officer and joined the Samata Party at my beloved friend Nitishs request. 

 He is going to recruit employees under the players quota. You collect certificates from any club and come to me, Das apparently told youths who pestered him for a job through his connection.

 His bail prayer was rejected in the high court today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Land pitch in college polls

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 16: Singur and Nandigram have pushed all issues of academic importance to the background in the campaign for the upcoming Calcutta University senate and the undergraduate council elections.

 The low academic standard in state colleges is not a hot issue for those steering the campaign for the September 21 elections. Nor is the shortage of faculty, or the absence of principals in many colleges, not to mention the poor infrastructure like inadequate laboratory facilities. 

 We are aware of the problems in the colleges. But the elections to the two key university bodies, held once in four years, assume significance this time in the wake of the statewide protest by the Opposition on Singur and Nandigram. We have to counter the Oppositions false propaganda, a key member of the Left-affiliated Siksha Ganatantrikaran Samastha said.

 The Samastha had swept the elections to both bodies in 2003. The non-Left camp drew a blank. 

 Over 4,000 teachers from 168 colleges will elect 25 candidates to the senate, the universitys highest-decision making body. Nine candidates will be elected to the undergraduate council. The poll, through secret ballot, will be held between 10am and 5pm.

 Samastha secretary Mihir Guha admitted that the land acquisition issue figured in the campaign. Our campaign managers are referring to the resolution adopted by the West Bengal College and University Teachers Association which condemned the March 14 police firing in Nandigram. We believe that our voters will not be influenced by the Opposition. 

 Sikha Sengupta, Samastha vice-president, said: Though we want to limit our campaign to academic matters, the Singur-Nandigram issue figures in the campaign. 

 Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress, which has fielded candidates for the first time, is making land acquisition its main poll plank. 

 We are telling teachers how the Left Front had forcibly taken away land from unwilling farmers for Tata small-car project in Singur and its mass killings in Nandigram on March 14. We are confident of cashing in on this, said Trinamuls Sovandeb Chattopadhyay.

 With the elections just days away, teachers have begun skipping classes and staff rooms have turned campaign centres with daily huddles to discuss strategies.

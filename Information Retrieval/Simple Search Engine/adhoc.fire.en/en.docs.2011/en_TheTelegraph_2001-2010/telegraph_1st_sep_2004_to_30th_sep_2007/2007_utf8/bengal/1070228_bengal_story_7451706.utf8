The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CM refers to Modi success

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Calcutta, Feb. 27: In a note to the Left Front partners, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has pointed out Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modis ability to attract investments, never mind his politics, and suggested that Bengal should not sit idle.

 He has been bringing the highest investment to the state for years. Riots may be taking place, but investments are also flowing. Should we sit idle? the chief minister has asked in the note, forwarded to the allies by front chief Biman Bose.

 Investors are also making a beeline for Bengal.... (But) if we fail to take decisions in time, the money would go elsewhere, he warned the allies, who are not happy with Bhattacharjee courting capital. 

 The chief minister admitted in the document his strident opposition to business houses in the past, but also referred to the epochal transition that Bengal is witnessing. I once supported the call to oust Tata-Birla. Today, we are helping the Tatas set up shop here in a changed situation. Is there any alternative?

 The note, a follow-up to meetings with the RSP, CPI and the Forward Bloc on the land reforms bill, however, failed to placate the partners. They complained that it says nothing about the contentious issues such as relaxing the rural land ceiling and allowing the private sector right to transfer land acquired for industry. 

 It only underlines the chief ministers vision of development, a front leader said.

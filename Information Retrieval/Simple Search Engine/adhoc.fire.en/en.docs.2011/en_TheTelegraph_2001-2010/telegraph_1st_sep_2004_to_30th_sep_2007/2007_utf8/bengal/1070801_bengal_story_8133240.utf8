 Durgapur, July 31: A man in his mid-50s, his wife and daughter were arrested last night on charges of engaging children for domestic work and harassing them sexually.

 The children two girls and a boy had been brought to tea-leaf trader Swapan Chakrabortys house by his son-in-law, who is absconding. 

 Twelve-year-old Tulsi Dorjee fled the Chakrabortys flat here last night and complained to the apartments security guard that Swapan, 55, had tried to molest her on Sunday.

 The guard, Gouranga Mondal, called police, who rescued Kanika Burman, 13, and Arjun Kujur, 14, (names changed) from the flat. 

 The three are children of Dooars tea garden workers, most of whom live in penury.

 Swapan, his wife Ila, 47, and their daughter Sumana, 26, were taken into custody and charged with violating the child labour act, forcible confinement, torturing the children and cheating. 

 In addition, Swapan was charged with molestation. 

 However, all three were granted bail by a local court to- day on condition that they will not leave the town. 

 Tulsi and Arjun are from Nagrakata in Jalpaiguri and Kanika from Dinhata in Cooch Behar. Their parents have been informed through the local police stations. 

 If the parents cant come over, well send the children home. They will be in our custody till then, Durgapur circle inspector Pannalal Goswami said. 

 The police said both Swapan and his son-in-law Uttam, who is based in Siliguri, are tea traders. Sumana, a mother of two, came to her fathers house in Durgapur on July 7 with her husband and the tea workers children. 

 The Chakrabortys beat up the children if they failed to clean their toilets, said an investigating officer.

 On Sunday, Swapan allegedly held Tulsi from behind while she was cleaning the floor and tried to molest her. 

 He (Swapan) came from behind and hugged me and kissed me. He started beating me when I raised the alarm. Soon, Ila kakima (auntie) and Sumana mami (also an aunt) arrived and joined in the torture, Tulsi said at the police station. 

 Kanika was also allegedly beaten up time and again for raising her voice against the daily torture. Sumana auntie and Uttam uncle brought us promising our parents good jobs here, Kanika said.

 The police said Uttam visits the Dooars tea gardens regularly for business. 

 His wife Sumana has a two-year-old daughter and a son of eight months. The children from north Bengal were asked to look after the babies. We are probing whether the family had any other motive behind bringing the three here, a police officer said.

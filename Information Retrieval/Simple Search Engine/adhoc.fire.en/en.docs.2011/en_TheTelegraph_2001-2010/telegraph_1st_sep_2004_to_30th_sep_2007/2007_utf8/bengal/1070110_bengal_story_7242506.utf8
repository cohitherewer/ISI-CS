 Farmers turn border guards

 SIMI KAMBOJ 

 Nandigram, Jan. 9: Fear has turned farmers here into sentinel, mounting vigil along the village border. 

 Weve sent our children to relatives houses in safer villages on the Khejuri side. Between 6 pm and 6 am, we take turns to keep watch on the riverside border, said Pratap Chandra Mondol, a resident of Sonachura where a clash claimed several lives on Sunday morning.

 Leaders of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee said over 20,000 farmers from seven villages have been keeping watch along a 17-km stretch of the Hooghly and Haldi rivers, fearing an attack from the other bank.

 Villagers have instructions to blow conches to alert neighbours if they spot or hear anything suspicious, while areas with mosques would give out a warning on the public address system. 

 Farmers are unanimous that they will not let police enter their villages, not even to protect their houses. We do not trust them. What were they doing when the CPM cadres were shooting at us? Even the CPM activists are dressing in police uniform. How do we know the difference? asked Anjana Bera, who is part of a patrol team.

 A generator has been installed at the village bazaar to light up some of the pockets. 

 Anjana was present when Bharat Mondol, who was on guard along the Bhangabera canal, was shot on Sunday. He had charged towards the assailants, invisible in the dark, with a brick, she said.

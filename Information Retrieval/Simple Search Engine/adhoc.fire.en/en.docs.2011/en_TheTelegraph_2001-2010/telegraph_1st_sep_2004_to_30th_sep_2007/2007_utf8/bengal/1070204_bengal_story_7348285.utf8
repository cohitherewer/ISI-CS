The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Jamait shove to Mamata

 OUR BUREAU 

 Feb. 3: Mamata Banerjee was forced to shift the venue of her Nandigram rally 24 hours before kick-off apparently under pressure from the Jamait Ulema-i-Hind and the Congress.

 It will now be held on the Nandigram College ground, 11 km away from the original venue at Garchakraberia, where every party now wants to prove its clout.

 Trinamul Congress leaders attributed the change to Mamatas health, but Jamait leaders refused to buy the argument. 

 They virtually accused Mamata of trying to hijack the villagers movement, which started at Garchakraberia, about 200 km from Calcutta.

 We started the anti-acquisition movement here months ago. We bore the brunt when violence had rocked Nandigram last month. So, why shall we allow Mamata to reap her political harvest by organising a meeting here? asked a local Jamait leader. 

 Mamata, who chaired a Save Farmland Committee meeting at her Kalighat house today, left for Kolaghat in the evening. From there, she will go to Nandigram about 90 minutes drive tomorrow. 

 Subhendu Adhikary, the Trinamul MLA from neighbouring Contai South, had decided on holding the rally at Garchakraberia. 

 Sources said Jamait leaders realised it would not be wise to let Trinamul make inroads in places like Garchakraberia, Sonachura, Muhammadpur or Kalicharanpur. 

 The state secretary of the outfit, Siddiqullah Chowdhury, had invited Mamata to join hands with the Jamait and lead the anti-acquisition movement. But Trinamuls apparent decision to go it alone made the Jamait change its stance.

 Leaders of the Nandigram-based Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee said Mamata could have asked them to organise the rally instead of holding it under the banner of the Save Farmland Committee. This committee is basically a Trinamul organisation. There is no question of playing into the hands of Trinamul, said Sabuj Pradhan of the Nandigram committee.

 The Congress said Priya Ranjan Das Munshi had wanted to address a rally at Garchakraberia. However, dug up roads had to be repaired for the purpose and Trinamul supporters objected to it. So, why will we allow Trinamul to hold a rally at the same spot. Moreover, Mamata was nowhere near Nandigram when trouble erupted, a leader said.

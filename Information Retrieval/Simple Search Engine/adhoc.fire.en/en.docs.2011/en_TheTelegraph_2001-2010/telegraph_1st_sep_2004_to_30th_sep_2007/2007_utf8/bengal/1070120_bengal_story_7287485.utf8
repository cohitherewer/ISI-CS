The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Swoop on child marriages

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dhubulia, Jan. 19: The Nadia administration today stopped marriages of two minor girls in Dhubulia as part of its drive against child marriage.

 A team led by sub-divisional officer (headquarters) Joydeep Mukherjee, that visited Dhubulia, 120 km from Calcutta, found that the mother of one of the girls was an active member of Banasree, an NGO creating awareness against child marriage.

 The team also included officials of the UNDP that is funding a project to prevent child marriage in seven districts in Bengal, including Nadia.

 Saraswati Mondal, 40, mother of 14-year-old Ratna (name changed), broke down when she saw the SDO leading other district officials to her house this morning.

 She urged Mukherjee to allow the marriage. My daughter failed twice in Class V and does not have the intelligence to study. She also has no energy to work. We are feeding her with her fathers hard-earned money. Please dont stop the marriage, Saraswati told the SDO.

 Saraswatis husband Gopal, an employee of a roadside eatery, said he had to raise Rs 10,000 for dowry.

 Ratna told the SDO that her mother was forcing the marriage on her. I dont want to get married at this age. I want to return to school, she said weeping when the SDO asked her whether she was being married against her wish.

 I was surprised to find that someone who is supposed to create awareness against child marriage is herself getting her minor daughter married, Mukherjee said.

 Banasree chief Bela Chowdhury said: Saraswati was one of our active campaigners against child marriage. We have to think what steps we can take against her, she said.

 The SDO then led his team to another house where 16-year-old Shobha Mondal (name changed) was supposed to get married tomorrow.

 Unlike Ratna, Shobha had never attended school. Her father died seven years ago and her mother, Jharna, works in Krishnagar College as a group D employee. Shobha is at home all day alone. Her two elder brothers, both drivers, often stay away from the family for long stretches of time.

 Sir, please save me. My mother is forcing me to marry. I dont want to get married at such an early age, a tearful Shobha said.

 One of her friends, Jaya Das, a Class IX student, said Shobhas mother felt insecure leaving her daughter at home alone. So, her mother decided to marry her off, said Jaya.

 Mukherjee assured Shobha that she would be enrolled in a vocational training programme.

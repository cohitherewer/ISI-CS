The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Theft near CM home

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 19: A gang today broke into a ground-floor flat in the chief ministers neighbourhood at Palm Avenue and fled with a gold chain, an earring and two rings.

 S. Francis, 50, and her 25-year-old daughter found the door of their 79 Palm Avenue home open when they returned from a relatives house in the evening, police said. The two-room flat had been ransacked. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee lives in 59 Palm Avenue, around 50 metres from the site of the theft.

 It seems to be the handiwork of a local gang. Raids are being conducted to nab them, an officer of Karaya police station said.

 Francis has been staying at the rented flat with her daughter for the past few years. She works in an office while her daughter is doing BEd from Loretto College. Both had gone out at 8am today and returned around 6pm to discover the theft, the officer said. 

 Francis raised an alarm and a large crowd gathered outside their flat. The police were informed and officers of the detective departments burglary section arrived at the spot. 

 A senior officer said the mushrooming slums over a vast stretch of Palm Avenue and Karaya have largely contributed to the spurt in criminal activities in the area. Besides, crime lords are shielded by politicians in what should be the citys most protected locality. 

 On Tuesday midnight, a gang had beaten up three youths from Palm Avenue when they resisted an extortion bid. The police initially refused to lodge a complaint. They filed it only when residents threatened to report the matter to Bhattacharjee.

 Child rapist lynched

 A 32-year-old man was beaten to death after he was accused of raping a girl as old as his son. Pintu Das, an unemployed resident of Kalyangarh in North 24-Parganas, about 40km from Calcutta, had called his six-year-old next-door neighbour on Tuesday afternoon when there was no one at home and allegedly raped her.

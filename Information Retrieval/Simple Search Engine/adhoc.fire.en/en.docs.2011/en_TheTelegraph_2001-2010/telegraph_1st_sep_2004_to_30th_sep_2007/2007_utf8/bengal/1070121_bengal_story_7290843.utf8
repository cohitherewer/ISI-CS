The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Missionaries seek free hand 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 20: Christian missionary schools want the government to include a set of exclusive guidelines for them in the bill on private institutions it plans to table.

 At a meeting today, founder bodies of such schools, which number about 700, also decided that they would ask the government to pass the bill only after they endorse the final draft.

 Our right to run our educational institutions without state interference is safeguarded in the Constitution, Reverend Lucas Sircar, the archbishop of the Calcutta diocese, said after the meeting. 

 We will request the government to send us a copy of the complete draft of the proposed bill for our final comment before it is passed.

 The founder bodies have come up with a set of suggestions on the guidelines. Some of them are:

 The bill should not infringe on their right to establish and administer their schools

 The schools must have the freedom to select staff and be allowed to come up on a site of their choice

 The government will not have any say on fee structure but can advise.

 The West Bengal Association of Christian Schools and the Bangiya Christiya Pariseba, an association of church representatives, convened todays meeting to discuss the draft bill the education department had sent to the two organisations last month.

 One of the suggestions in the draft bill was an authority for mapping, planning and even distribution of all categories of schools in the state. 

 We are not going to accept the bill if the government ignores our suggestions, Herod Mullick, the general secretary of the Bangiya Christiya Pariseba, said.

 Representatives of the Calcutta diocese of the Church of North India, which controls city schools like La Martiniere, St James, Pratt Memorial and St Thomas, did not attend the meeting.

 There were no representatives from the Church of North Indias Durgapur diocese, either.

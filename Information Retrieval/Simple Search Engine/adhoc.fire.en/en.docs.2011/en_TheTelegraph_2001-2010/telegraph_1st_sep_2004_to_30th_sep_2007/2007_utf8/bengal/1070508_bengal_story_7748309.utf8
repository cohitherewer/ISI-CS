 Calcutta, May 7: The Left has found an unlikely ally in its opposition to foreign retail companies with the German giant Metro Cash amp; Carry pledging small Indian retailers help to beat competition. 

 Wed work in partnership with the local mom-and-pop stores and train them to compete with foreign retailers, said Marcus Dichtl, the director (finance and administration) of Metro Cash amp; Carry, India.

 The company plans to set up an academy to train small retailers in merchandising, packaging and other aspects of running a retail outlet.

 It formally launched a training programme for 12,000 sheep farmers in West Midnapore, Purulia, Bankura, Burd- wan, Birbhum, Murshidabad, South 24-Parganas and Cooch Behar today.

 We will source meat from the local producers. So the programme is aimed at improving the quality of livestock, deputy managing director Gerardo Monzillo said while unveiling the programme. 

 Two hundred fishing crews would also be trained and fish-handling infrastructure developed in South 24-Parganas Frazergunj. 

 Although the preparations are in full swing, the company is likely to miss the June deadline for its first store in Calcutta because of legal complications over the plot. 

 We expect the legal problems to be sorted out at the earliest. Plans are afoot to open two more stores in Calcutta soon, Monzillo added. 

 Metro outlets, with around 100,00 sq ft of floor space, follow a standard design and involve investments of euro 16-17 million (about Rs 95 crore). 

 Around 80,000 members hotels, restaurants, caterers and small retailers have signed up with the company to buy products from its outlets.

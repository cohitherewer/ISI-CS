The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Poll promise of jobs put back into cold storage

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Calcutta, April 8: The government has put recruitment into the freezer after keeping it briefly on the boil.

 A circular issued recently by chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb directs all departments to make a list of vacant posts filling which is inescapably necessary. 

 The government, however, has kept escape routes open for at least another year.

 Such an exercise will take about a year to complete. This means no recruitment can be made before that, a senior official said.

 The lists will be screened by the finance department before the recruitment pro- posals are put before the cabinet committee on appointments. 

 When its funds crunch peaked in 2000, the government made the committees approval mandatory for filling up posts. 

 The circular applies to government-aided educational institutions, public undertakings, corporations and statutory and local bodies under state control besides government offices. 

 It doesnt apply to posts filled up through the Public Service Commission (PSC).

 The circular directs every department to count the sanctioned posts in each category of secretariat, directorate and regional offices as well as the vacancies.

 After the number of inescapably necessary posts is reported to the finance department, it will decide the number of posts to be filled in each category. Some of the posts, the official said, will be kept vacant.

 The departments that want additional posts created will first have to explore and cite possibilities of abolishing posts in other categories.

 In the run-up to last years Assembly elections, veteran CPM leader Jyoti Basu had announced that the government had lifted the freeze on recruitment and promised a job rush.

 We had frozen 80,000 jobs in different areas because Bengals economy at that point was under strain. Now the economy has improved, so we have removed the ban. The election has got nothing to do with it, Basu had said.

 There were around 80,000 vacancies then, almost the same number as now, though around 12,000 people have been recruited since.

 Around 12,000 employ- ees have retired during the period. We realise that the government is not in a position to fill up all the existing vacancies, said Jyoti Prasad Basu, general secretary of the Co-ordination Committee, the CPM union of state government employees.

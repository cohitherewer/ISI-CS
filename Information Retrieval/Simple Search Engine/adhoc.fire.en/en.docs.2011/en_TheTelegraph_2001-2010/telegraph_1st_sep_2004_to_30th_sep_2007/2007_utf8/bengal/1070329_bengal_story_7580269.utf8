The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, March 28: The high court today directed the government to disburse the pension of a schoolteacher who was forced to take leave for an indefinite period after being diagnosed with leprosy.

 Leprosy is curable and those suffering from it are not untouchables, Justice Soumitra Pal reminded the government and Amiya Bhusan Junior High School in Rampurhat, which forced Gour Chandra Dutta, now 62, to virtually quit in December 1985. His leprosy was detected after 20 years of service. 

 Cooch Behar: Ano- ther eight-year-old was trampled to death by an elephant in Jalpaiguris Banarhat on Wednesday. Raj Kherbar tried in vain to flee when the tusker broke into his hut at Kalabari tea estate. Mohammad Feroze, also eight, was killed on the edge of a highway on Tuesday.

 Darjeeling: The Happy Valley tea garden here will resume work on Thursday after over two years. The garden has 334 workers, who were living in penury since it shut down in 2005.

 Bolpur: Ten people were held and nearly 11,000 paddy field pipits were recovered from the Mayureswar area of Birbhum. Catching pipits is illegal. A forest official said the birds were being taken to Calcutta, 240 km away, where they would have sold for Rs 5 apiece.

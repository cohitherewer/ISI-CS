The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Blasts with Maoist land warning

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 24: The CPI (Maoist) has said the two blasts targeting police in West Midnapore this month were meant to drive home a message on Nandigram. 

 On March 14, at least 14 people had died in Nandigram during police firing on agitators opposing the governments acquisition of land.

 Somen, the state chief of the Naxalite group, has said the explosions both missed the targeted policemen were planned to teach the government a lesson.

 We successfully planted the explosives on a road and members of our armed squad opened fire at the policemen. But they had a narrow escape, Somen said about the June 7 blast. A day later, another landmine exploded in a nearby jungle. But the policemen escaped a second time.

 The Naxalite outfit had warned the state government within two days of the March 14 police firing that they would be made to pay. 

 According to the state Intelligence Bureau (IB) , the explosives were planted in Lalgarh two months before the blast when a road was being laid through Lalgarh forest. There was little police vigil as a huge police force from West Midnapore was deployed in Nandigram, an IB official said.

 The activists of the (Maoist) outfit appointed the labourers engaged in the construction to plant the explosives.

 But the labourers failed to mark the trees to show the exact location of the explosives. When the Maoists detonated them, the policemen were not hurt, another IB official said.

 The cops were unhurt in the June 8 explosion in the forest as their attackers could not time the blast correctly. Poor visibility, mainly because of the dense branches and trees, seems to be the reason. 

 The Maoist leaders, however, have warned the government that they could strike any moment again.

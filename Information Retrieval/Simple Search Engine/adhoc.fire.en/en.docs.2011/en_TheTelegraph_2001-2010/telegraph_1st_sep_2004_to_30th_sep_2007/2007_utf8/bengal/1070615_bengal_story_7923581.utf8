 Mamata rap for MLA

 Calcutta, June 14: Mamata Banerjee today cautioned Trinamul Congress MLA Dinesh Bajaj, who wanted to meet Hashim Abdul Halim to congratulate him on completing 25 years as Speaker.

 But Bajaj had already sent a bouquet to Halim. Party sources said the MLA later expressed regret to Trinamul Congress general secretary Partha Chatterjee.

 Congress legislature party leader Manas Bhunia met Halim. We want you to be Speaker for a long time, he told Halim. That means you people will never come to power, the Speaker replied.

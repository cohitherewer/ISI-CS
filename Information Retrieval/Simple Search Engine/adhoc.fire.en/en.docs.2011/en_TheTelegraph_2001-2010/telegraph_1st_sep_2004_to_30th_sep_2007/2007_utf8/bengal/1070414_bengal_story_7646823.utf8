The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Forest queers steel pitch

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 13: The government is trying to redraw the map of the proposed Jindal steel plant to spare 200 acres of forest.

 The state needs the Centres nod for the acquisition of the green patch in Salboni and a recent communique from Delhi over another project has made it apprehensive.

 The power department has got an ultimatum from the Union environment and forests ministry for not allotting land to compensate the loss of 577 acres of forest during the construction of its Bakreswar project. 

 The Union ministry has warned us that it would revoke the approval it had granted for acquiring the forest. The state government has neither allotted land in lieu of the forest taken nor granted money to plant trees, though all this was promised in 2001. Such a track record has made our job in Salboni very diffi-cult, said a land and land reforms department official.

 Land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah will meet forest department officials on Wednesday to assess the status of the forest area that figures in the plot earmarked for the Jindal plant. 

 It has been referred to as bush land in the collectors records since the 1960s, but a survey by the land and forest departments yesterday revealed that around 200 acres in the proposed plot form a bushy jungle.

 Jindal Steel needs over 5,000 acres for its factory, of which it will buy 500 acres on its own while the rest is government land.

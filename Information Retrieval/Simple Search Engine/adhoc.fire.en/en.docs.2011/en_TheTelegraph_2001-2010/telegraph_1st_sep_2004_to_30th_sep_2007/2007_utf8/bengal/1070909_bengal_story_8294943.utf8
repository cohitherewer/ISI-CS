 No guard at water tank

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Howrah, Sept. 8: The discovery of a decomposed body in a Howrah reservoir that supplies water to almost the entire town has raised questions over security measures employed by the civic body.

 Sources in the Howrah Municipal Corporation said the watchtower inside the water treatment plant at Padmapukur had been left unmanned since it was built. 

 The staircase of the watchtower collapsed several years ago and was never repaired, an official said.

 Only a portion of the boundary is fenced off with barbed wire. The rest is protected by a brick wall, portions of which are so low that anyone can climb over it. Wild bushes and undergrowth cover the areas near the barbed-wire fence. Intruders can cut the wire and enter unnoticed, he said.

 Residents alleged that criminals often entered the plant to drink and gamble.

 Mayor Gopal Mukherjee did not deny the lapse. After yesterdays incident, we have decided to deploy more guards. The watchtower will be repaired and manned.

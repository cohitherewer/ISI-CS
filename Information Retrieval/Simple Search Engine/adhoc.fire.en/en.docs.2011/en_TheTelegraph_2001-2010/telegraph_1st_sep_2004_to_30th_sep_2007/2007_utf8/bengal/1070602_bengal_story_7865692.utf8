 Calcutta, June 1: City schools aced this years Higher Secondary examination, with four students among the probable Top Ten.

 The pass percentage crossed 86 per cent a record in the last five years. 

 Like other years, the per- formance of schools in Calcutta has been better than those in the districts, said Gopa Dutta, the president of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education.

 The council said 86.85 per cent students cleared the HS hurdle in the city. Following the national trend, girls did better than the boys. At 88.96, their pass percentage is around four higher. 

 Arpita Saha, of Rahara Bhabanath Institution for Girls, is believed to be the city topper and second in the state with 457 out of 500. 

 I expected a decent result, but this is beyond expectation, said Arpita, who wants to be an engineer. 

 Five marks behind Arpita is Tamaghna Biswas of Nava Nalanda High School, who had topped Madhyamik 2005. He has ranked fourth in the state. 

 I genuinely like studying. Even when I was done with my textbooks, I would read other books. I expected to do well, said Tamaghna, who ranked sixth in the Joint Entrance Examination for medicine. 

 My father is a doctor. I always wanted to be a doctor, he said, as congratulatory calls kept coming. 

 Debayan Gupta of Kalachand High School, Dunlop, and Mainak Biswas are the other two from the city on the list. 

 Among the schools that have done well are Patha Bhavan, St Lawrence, Shri Shikshayatan, South Point, Gokhale Memorial, Carmel Convent, Holy Child, Hare, Hindu and Sakhawat Memorial.

 Although the pass percentage has increased this year, the number of students getting above 90 per cent has fallen, resulting in several long faces even among the big scorers.

 My performance is below expectation. I am not happy with my marks in English. I just got 80, said Debayan, who aggregated 449.

 Ashok Maity, the president of the West Bengal Headmasters Association, said the revised evaluation system is to blame. It must be reviewed to ascertain the reason behind the low scores, he said.

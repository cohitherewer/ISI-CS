 Idol club calls 12-hour hill strike

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Darjeeling, Sept. 28: The Prashant Fan Club has called a 12-hour bandh across the hills tomorrow to protest against the Siliguri flare-up. 

 Bimal Gurung, a GNLF leader and an adviser to the fan club, said: We protest against the incidents that took place in Siliguri. Strong action must be taken against the FM station, failing which we will take to the streets. 

 Gurung made the announcement at Chowk Bazar, in the heart of the town, around 6.30pm. 

 He added later that the bandh was also aimed at ensuring that no untoward incident took place tomorrow. The people here are in a volatile mood. We must ensure that there is peace. But we will take to the streets if justice is not delivered to us. 

 Although Gurung is a GNLF leader, the party has not taken a stand on the strike.

 Dawa Pakhrin, the GNLF president in Kalimpong, said: We will maintain peace and tranquillity across the hills but it is the duty of the administration to maintain law and order. 

 As Siliguri burnt, Kurseong MLA Shanta Chhetri met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings. He said the home ministry was getting in touch with the Centre.

 D.T. Lepcha, the Darjeeling range deputy inspector-general of police, convened a peace meeting here that was attended by senior leaders of the GNLF and all other local political outfits.

 Lepcha appealed to the people to maintain peace and said the incident should not be given a communal colour.

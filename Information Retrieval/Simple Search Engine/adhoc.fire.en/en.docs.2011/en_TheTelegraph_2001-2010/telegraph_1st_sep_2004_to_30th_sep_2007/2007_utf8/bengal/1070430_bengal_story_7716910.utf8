 Dengue suspense for 31 in Nadia

 OUR BUREAU

 Krishnagar/Calcutta, April 29: Thirty-one people in Nadia are suffering from a mystery fever suspected to be a new strain of dengue that has already killed three, district authorities said today.

 Thirty of them, including two who fell ill today, are from Betai village and one is from Krishnagunj.

 Abhijit Kar, 35, and Jayanta Biswas, 40, have been admitted to a hospital in Krishnagar. Their blood samples have been sent to the School of Tropical Medicine (STM), Calcutta, for tests. 

 District magistrate Onkar Singh Meena, quoting a report from the state health department, today scaled down the death toll from the five reported yesterday.

 He said Gobinda Sarkar and his friend Nityagopal Chakraborty had died of viral encephalitis and not dengue.

 Gobinda died at a private hospital in Calcutta on Friday while Nityagopal died at the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Beleghata, yesterday.

 Tests at the STM on seven patients have revealed that the fever is a new strain of dengue, different from the three known types classical, haemorrhagic and shock syndrome. Some of the samples will be sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, to confirm it, a health official said today. 

 However, some uncertainty prevails over the figures cited by the Nadia authorities in the absence of confirmed test results for all the patients.

 Dilip Ghosh, 40, of Pabakhali in Krishnagunj, about 120 km from Calcutta, caught fever a month ago. He was admitted to the district hospital. 

 The doctor cant tell me what he is suffering from. Only two days ago, they had sent the samples to Calcutta and told me that they are not ruling out anything, said his wife Anjali. 

 We are collecting blood samples of all those who are falling sick and sending them to the STM. All BDO offices in the district have been alerted. The health team in Betai has been asked to be ready round the clock. Any deterioration in the situation has to be reported to the district headquarters, said Meena.

 Since the disease is spread by mosquitoes, which breed in stagnant water, block offices in the district have been asked to educate people about the dangers of allowing water to accumulate.

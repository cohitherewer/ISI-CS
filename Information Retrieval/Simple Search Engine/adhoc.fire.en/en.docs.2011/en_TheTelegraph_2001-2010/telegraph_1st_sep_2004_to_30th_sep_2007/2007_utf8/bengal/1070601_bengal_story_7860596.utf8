 BPL fury on civic officers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Berhampore, May 31: Congress supporters protesting against alleged discrepancy in the below poverty line list beat up Beldanga municipality chairman Priyaranjan Ghosh and executive officer Sudhangshu Sekhar Das today.

 A mob of around 50 led by Beldanga Congress president Sujit Mukherjee went to the municipality office this afternoon to lodge their protest.

 The mob turned violent when a war of words with the chairman and the executive officer turned ugly. 

 Both were taken to hospital with injuries on the head. Five persons, including Mukherjee, have been arrested.

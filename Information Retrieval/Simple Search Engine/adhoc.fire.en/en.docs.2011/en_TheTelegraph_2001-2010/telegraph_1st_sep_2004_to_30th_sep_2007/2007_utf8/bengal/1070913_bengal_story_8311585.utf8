 Bridge toll on Mother Dairy price 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 12: Mother Dairy is set to hike milk prices by 50 paise a litre following the National Highway Authority of Indias refusal to exempt their vans from toll on the Second Vivekananda Bridge.

 We had written to the authority through the transport department, seeking an exemption since milk supply is an essential service. Fire tenders, police vehicles and ministers cars enjoy the exemption now, animal resources department secretary Dilip Chakraborty said. 

 The state-run dairy has 300 vans that carry milk from the Dankuni unit across the city everyday.

 The dairy has a daily sale of 3.4 lakh litres. Each van crossing the bridge has to pay Rs 300 for a to-and-fro trip. It means an annual burden of around Rs 54 lakh, a dairy official said. A 50 paise hike would nearly offset the loss.

 Officials said a central group of ministers denied Mother Dairy the exemption probably because milk companies in other states are mostly private and do not enjoy such an exemption.

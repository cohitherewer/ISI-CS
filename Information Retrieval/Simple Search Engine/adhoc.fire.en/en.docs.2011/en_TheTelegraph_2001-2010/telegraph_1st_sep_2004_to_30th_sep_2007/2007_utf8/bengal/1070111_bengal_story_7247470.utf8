The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Villagers see grand victory

 NARESH JANA

 Nandigram, Jan. 10: Sukdeb Das had carried the dead Bharat Mondol on his van from Sonachura to the Nandigram block hospital on Sunday. 

 If only the chief minister had assured us a few days ago that there was no immediate possibility of land acquisition here, said Sukdeb, 20. 

 Bharat was shot during the gun battle early on Sunday morning.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee admitted yesterday that the government had made a blunder by issuing a notice on land acquisition here and ordered that the paper be torn to pieces. 

 The chief minister also assured the villagers that there would be no land acquisition until all details were worked out and a land map prepared, taking everybody into confidence.

 Ratan Patra, 19, was today busy helping other villagers repair a road that they dug up a few days ago. 

 Our movement wasnt in vain. We are very happy. We had cut the trench to prevent police and officials from entering the villages. After hearing what the chief minister said yesterday, we feel happy. It gives us the feeling of a grand victory, Patra said.

 The mood among the villagers, who kept Nandigram out of bounds for the police and the administration over the past week, was upbeat today.

 Leaders of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee were happy too. At Dinabandhupur, they held a meeting this evening exhorting more people to join the movement. The meeting urged the local Congress unit to be more involved with the anti-acquisition protests. 

 We may have launched an intense agitation against land acquisition here, but we are not against Bengals industrialisation. Acquisition can always take place on fallow land or on chars on the banks of the Haldi, said Bhabani Das of the SUCI, also a leader of the committee.

 We were mildly surprised at the chief minister taking such a humane stand. He was quite firm on Singur, he added.

 The Trinamul Congress block president and convener of the committee, Abu Taher, sounded firmer. We will not allow any acquisition of farmland, he said.

 In Calcutta, party chief Mamata Banerjee urged the government to withdraw all notifications for land identification and acquisition in Singur, Nandigram and Bhangar.

 Villagers gift land for road

 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN

 Rejinagar, Aug. 28: Over 350 residents of a Murshidabad village feel a road will be of greater use to them than a small patch of their land.

 They have donated their land for a 6km link road, an extension of National Highway 34, when people in many areas have refused to even sell their land to the government.

 PWD and National Highway Authority of India officials faced angry villagers in Na-dia and North 24-Parganas when they went to conduct a survey for the expansion of the same highway, which passes through the two districts before entering Murshidabad.

 The expansion is part of the Golden Quadrilateral linking the four metros. In Rejinagar, about 170km from Calcutta, 365 people will give 11.5 acres, valued at nearly Rs 1 crore. 

 An appeal by foreign mi- nister Pranab Mukherjee, an MP from Jangipur in Murshidabd, and PWD minister Kshiti Goswami apparently moved them. Opening a bridge at Farakka in June, the two had sought the villagers co-operation for the Asian Development Bank-funded project. 

 We didnt expect them to respond voluntarily. Three villages have set an example for others in the state, said additional district magistrate Jeevan Krishna Sadhu Khan.

 About an acre has been handed over to the administration already.

 The residents of Murutia, Andulberia and Nazirpur are either cultivators or traders. But the land they are donating is not farmland, but portions of shops or boundary walls.

 Anchara Bibi, the CPM pradhan of the Andulberia pan-chayat, said the road will ben-efit over 30,000 people. Now, we take a 6km kuchcha road to reach Manganpara for a bus. The trek is impossible during rains and for months after it.

 Equally happy was Nemai De, one of the donors. I know that my stationery shop will have to be shifted. But it would be for the good of many.

 Naxalite held, 29 years on: A Naxalite who allegedly killed a warden and fled Purulia jailhas been held after 29 years.

 Birendra Singh Sardar, around 60 now, was caught in Purulias Juradi village, 310km from Calcutta, when he came to meet his family yesterday. 

 Sardar had been sent to jail for three years for snatching rifles from policemen in 1976.

 Friend kills teen

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 29: A 19-year-old higher secondary examinee from Canning in South 24-Parganas was murdered yesterday by his friend hours after he appeared for his history paper.

 Pabitra Halders body, with a slit throat and several stab injuries, was found in a field in Bahirsona, 2 km from his home, early this morning.

 Pabitra was appearing for the exam from the Taldi Mohan Chand Higher Secondary School.

 He was killed with a chopper. The body also bore a gunshot injury. However, these cannot be confirmed before the post-mortem, said a senior police official.

 Pabitras friend Subha Banerjee, a local resident, has been arrested on the basis of a complaint by Pabitras father Meghnath Halder, who deals in building materials. Subha confessed to having murdered Pabitra. Three others were involved but they are absconding, said Ajay Kumar Ghosh, additional superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas. 

 Ghosh said a diary was found in Pabitras trouser pocket in which he had written that he had lent Rs 5,000 to Subha. Pabitra had been asking Subha to return the money. This could have been the motive behind the murder.

 According to an official, Subha called Pabitra from his home around 7 last evening to join a Basanti puja immersion procession. When Pabitra did not return, his father lodged a missing complaint.

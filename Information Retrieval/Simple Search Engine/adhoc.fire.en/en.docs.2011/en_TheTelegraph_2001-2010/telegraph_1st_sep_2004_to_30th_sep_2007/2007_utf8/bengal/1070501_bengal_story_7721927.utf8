 Bahargunj (Khejuri), April 30: Around noon yesterday, Mir Anwar went to his field to clean up his plough and till the land when he saw hundreds of people running towards his village at Satengabari.

 They were armed with swords, rods and lathis. 

 Mir, 50, hurried home. His wife Sufia had just begun to cook the lunch.

 Two days ago, he had borrowed Rs 40,000 from the local co-operative for his daughters marriage.

 As Mir took out the money from a trunk and stuffed it in the pocket of his panjabi, 10 men stormed his house and started beating him up.

 I took off my panjabi and threw it to a corner of the room. But one of them suspected I had something to hide and found the money. They also took away our utensils, said Mir, one of the 1,500-odd CPM supporters who have fled Satengabari, Ranichowk, Brindabanchowk, Keyakhali, Jambari and Giribazar since yesterday.

 Now sheltered at a CPM camp at Bahargunj in Khejuri, Mir said: I had heard explosions in the distance in the morning. Seeing the mob, I knew they were out to loot our houses. I shouted at my wife and 18-year-old daughter Maleka to run through the back door.

 CPM district secretariat member Ashok Guria claimed that about 350 villagers had taken loans worth about Rs 60 lakh from the co-operative over the past few days. All the money was looted. 

 About 2,500 CPM supporters have been rendered homeless in Nandigram since trouble first broke out in January.

 Sahadeb Das, 65, of Brindabanchowk adjoining Satengabari alleged that his daughters-in-law were gangraped yesterday by a mob which held one of his sons and grandchildren at gunpoint . 

 Das managed to give the slip to the mob with his wife and younger son Lakshman. But Ram, the elder son, his wife and sister-in-law and their three children were not so lucky. 

 The daughters-in-law have been sent to their parents in Khejuri, said Das, at the camp.

 Over 1,000 people have taken shelter at the Bahargunj camp, said Himangshu Das, the CPM president of the Khejuri block panchayat samiti.

 The shelter was bursting at the seams tonight, with party workers struggling to cope with the surge of people. 

 We are finding it impossible to make room for the women. So we have decided to open two more camps, the panchayat leader said.

 A few hundred CPM supporters have fled to relatives in safer places. Durga Munian, 40, of Satengabari, headed to Kalagachhia with son Benoy and daughter Rekha. My husband Nishikanta is in Contai for work. But he is a known CPM supporter and so we didnt take chances, she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Delhi purse for border posts

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Jan. 10: The Centre is set to spend Rs 200 crore on the construction of three land customs stations at Petrapole, Hilli and Chengrabandha in the next 15 months.

 Funds to the tune of Rs 60 crore have also been earmarked by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (Apeda) for four projects.

 During my meeting with the chief minister this morning, I informed him about the Rs 260 crore worth of funding by the commerce and food processing ministries, junior commerce and industry minister Jairam Ramesh said here today.

 The Rs 60 crore to be provided by the food processing ministry is for a pineapple post-harvest centre in Siliguri, a flower market in Howrah, a potato marketing centre in Burdwan and storage facility at the Haldia port.

 Another Rs 8 crore has been sanctioned for a cold storage at Calcutta airport and Rs 4 crore for a cargo facility at Bagdogra airport that would specialise in handling flowers. 

 Ramesh had earlier arranged a meeting between urban development minister and Siliguri MLA Asok Bhattacharya and the Apeda chief to put the Bagdogra project, which had run into trouble because of land acquisition problems, on the fast track.

 The land customs stations were essential to maintain the momentum that trade with Bangladesh has attained in recent years, Ramesh said.

 A national project involving 13 land customs stations has been approved for execution by RITES, a company under the railways.

 Of the 13, three are in Bengal at Petrapole in North 24-Parganas, about 100 km from Calcutta, Hilli in South Dinajpur, 460 km from Calcutta, and Chengrabandha, 550 km from Calcutta. Four customs stations will be set up along the Bangladesh border in the Northeast. Four would be built on the Nepal border and one each on the Myanmar and Pakistan borders.

 Discussions were also held on ways to encourage more local traders to participate in trade through Nathu-la. 

 Agents of north Indian dealers now push products such as rice through agents based near the China border.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, July 14: Trinamul Congress MLA Javed Khan was arrested today for entering the operation theatre at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday after the death of a patient.

 He was later produced in court and granted bail.

 Khan and his supporters had stormed the hospital after 17-year-old Rafat Kausar died in the OT, minutes before she was to be operated. The MLA alleged that the girl had been raped and strangled. 

 Khans supporters staged a protest outside Beniapukur police station after his arrest.

 Calcutta: Power cuts continued to plague the city and nearby areas after a 250mw unit at the Budge Budge plant broke down following a technical snag on Saturday. CESC officials said engineers were trying to repair the fault and the unit would be started as soon as possible.

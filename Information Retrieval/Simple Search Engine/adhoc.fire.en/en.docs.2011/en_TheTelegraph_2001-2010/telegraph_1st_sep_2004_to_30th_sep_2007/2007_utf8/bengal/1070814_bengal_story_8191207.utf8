The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Land in hand, govt in limbo

 RABI BANERJEE

Krishnagar, Aug. 13: Three and a half decades ago, 10 farmers of a Nadia village had given 2.5 acres to the government for a health centre.

 The clinic at Shibpur village in Nakashipara has not seen the light of the day. 

 The farmers now want their land back.

 Humiliated by the governments lack of concern, they wrote to Nadia chief medical officer of health Mrinal Kanti Biswas last week: These 2.5 acres mean a lot to us. Please return our land if you cant construct a hospital there.

 The irony is that the protest comes when the government is crying hoarse about scarcity of land for development projects.

 Reacting to the farmers demand, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra today said he would look into the matter. I will ensure that the farmers get justice, he added. 

 The district chief medical officer said he would try to find out why the health centre could not be constructed, but ruled out returning the land to the villagers. Its surprising to know that the centre could not be set up in all these years. It is high on our agenda and well try to construct it. But the villagers demand to give back their land cant be met, said Biswas.

 Prabhash Joardar, whose father had contributed a little less than an acre for the clinic defended the decision. They were right. Crops are essential, but so is health. What are we supposed to do now if the government doesnt construct the health centre? If the government gives back our land, we will make it cultivable again, he said. 

 The land, when donated in 1972, was high yielding. We sacrificed it, but in vain, said an elderly villager.

 The 30,000-odd residents of Shibpur have to travel 22km to reach the nearest health facility the Nakashipara block hospital at Bethuadahari. 

 We are forced to turn to quacks for preliminary treatment. As for women in labour, arrangements for delivery have to be made at home, said Joardar, who is leading the return-our-land demand.

 Swapan Biswas, whose family had donated about three-fourths of an acre said several letters have been sent to Writers Buildings, but to no avail.

 The land where the health centre should have stood is now a childrens playground.

 Every now and then, the government threatens to take away land from investors who leave them unutilised. But it is not ready to follow the same course in its own case.

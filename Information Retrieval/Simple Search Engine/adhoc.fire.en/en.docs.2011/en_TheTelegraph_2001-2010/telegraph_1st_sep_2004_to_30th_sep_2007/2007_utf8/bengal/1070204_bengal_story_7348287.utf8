The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Pulldown order in CM locality

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 The Telegraph report on the illegal building 

 Calcutta, Feb. 3: The Calcutta Municipal Corporation today ordered the demolition of the two floors that were be- ing added illegally to a building barely 500 metres from the chief ministers house.

 Our officials inspected it and found that the promoter and the landlord had not taken any statutory approval to add two floors to the two-storeyed building on 5F Palm Avenue. I have ordered the demolition of the two floors, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said.

 Officers of the CMCs building department slapped a stop-work notice on the house yesterday. 

 The landlord, Manik Majumdar, had assigned Amir Khan to construct the two additional floors in November. Amir had joined the building with a three-storey structure on 5G Palm Avenue. 

 Despite complaints from other residents, Karaya police had turned a blind eye.

 On January 31, The Telegraph reported how the trend of illegal constructions had reached the VVIP neighbourhood. The authorities swung into action and arrested Amir from his Narkeldanga house after that. 

 Civic officials gave Majumdar about a month to pull down the illegal part of his house. If he doesnt, well do it, the mayor said.

 According to civic records, out of 600,000 buildings in the city, almost 50 per cent are illegal. 

 Areas such as Tangra, Topsia, Tiljala, Garden Reach, Palm Avenue and Kidderpore have witnessed a real estate boom over the past few years and much of the construction is being made illegally.

 The problem is acute in these areas as youths owing allegiance to local political leaders have turned small-time promoters. They are hand-in-glove with sections of police and civic officials.

 The mayor promised increased surveillance. Our officials will conduct random raids following tip-offs from our intelligence network. Stern action will be taken against promoters, realtors and landlords involved in illegal construction. 

 He admitted, though, that the crackdown would be difficult. The CMC would form special teams to work with the police and structural engineers. We are going to launch a special drive to demolish illegal structures. Last year, we pulled down 53, the mayor said.

 Illegal buildings are virtual death traps as the builders do not even leave room for ambulances and fire tenders to pass during an emergency.

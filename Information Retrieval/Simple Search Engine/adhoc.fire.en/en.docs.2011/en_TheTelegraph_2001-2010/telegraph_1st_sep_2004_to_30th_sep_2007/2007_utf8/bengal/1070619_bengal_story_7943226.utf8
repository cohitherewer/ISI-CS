 Lucknow, June 18: Uttar Pradesh police today arrested three men involved in the abduction of two 16-year-old boys from Asansol last month.

 Imran, Mohammad Irshad and Mohammad Arif revealed during interrogation that the boys friend, Mohammad Saddam, had helped them abduct Rishav Agarwal and Sanjit Meheria.

 Irshad and Arif belong to Bhabua in Bihar, while Imran is a resident of Belgachhia in Calcutta. 

 The two boys went missing after they left home on May 16, saying they were going to a birthday party. 

 Saddam, too, disappeared that day. The 18-year-old had told his parents he was going to Durgapur to attend the wedding of his friends sister. 

 All three returned home last week, said a police officer in Asansol.

 In Lucknow, special task force (STF) personnel said a Bihar-based politician was the brain behind the kidnap. 

 Imran, who was presented before the media, said the 10-member gang is led by Enamul Haq of Bhabua, who had contested the last Assembly elections.

 Bengal police had sent an SOS to their Uttar Pradesh counterparts after ransom calls were made from different parts of the state. 

 The boys had been set free after about Rs 45 lakh was paid as ransom. 

 A tip-off took the STF personnel to the Ashiyana neighbourhood, where the three had gone to buy a second-hand oil tanker.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Power snag takes toll on gadgets

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 29: A fault this evening plunged many houses in the Gouribari area of north Calcutta into darkness and damaged household equipment and computers. 

 Residents said there was a wild fluctuation of voltage around 6 pm, when the power went off. 

 The neutral cable emerg- ing from a transformer pillar-box apparently got burnt in a flash, leading to the fluctuation in voltage.

 A CESC official said the fault was repaired by quarter past nine, but work was on well past 10 pm. Police were deployed to ensure the clusters of angry people in the streets didnt turn violent.

 The residents alleged that many television sets, refrigerators, microwave ovens and air-conditioners were damaged. 

 There was a voltage surge around 6.10 and the lights went out, said Biswanath Ghosal, 66, of Raja Dinendra Street. When the supply was restored, neither my TV nor my tube lights were working, said Shaila Sen.

 Housewife Tapati Ghosal said CESC should compensate our losses, or well go to the consumer court.

 Airport revamp in private hands

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 23: The Calcutta airport modernisation project a Rs 1,500-crore venture will be given to a private party, with the Airports Authority of India monitoring it.

 Civil aviation secretary Ashok Chawla today said it would be implemented as a turnkey project.

 A detailed project report is being prepared and the global tender will be floated soon, he added. The contract will be finalised by September after bidding.

 The airports authority, which will provide technical guidance to the contractor, is expected to soon issue an expression of interest to invite bidders. 

 Work is scheduled to start in 2008 and is expected to be over by the middle of 2010.

 The Calcutta airport will get new terminals and other facilities on a par with global standards.

 Chawla said the Cooch Behar airport would be operational by August. A private airline is keen to start operations from Cooch Behar.

 The civil aviation secretary also outlined plans to upgrade the air network in the Northeast.

 A budget of Rs 651 crore has been sanctioned, 50 per cent of which would be utilised to build three greenfield airports at Pekyong in Sikkim, Itanagar in Arunachal Pradesh and Kohima in Nagaland.

 The rest would be used to upgrade other airports in the region. The Instrumental Landing System and other facilities would be installed to allow landing in bad weather and at night. 

 Chawla said the ministry was looking for more institutes to train pilots.

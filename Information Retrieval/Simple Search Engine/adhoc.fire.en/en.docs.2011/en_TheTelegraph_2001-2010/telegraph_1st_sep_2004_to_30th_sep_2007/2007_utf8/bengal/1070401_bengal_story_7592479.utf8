The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Airlines slash US fares

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 31: The US would come a few thousand miles closer to Calcutta this summer. Closer to pockets that is. 

 Locked in a fare war, British Airways and Air-India have slashed their minimum ticket prices to the lowest level in recent years. 

 Air-India today announced a return fare of Rs 32,000 (plus taxes) for New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. British Airways (BA) has already promised a Rs 36,000 (plus taxes) return trip from April. The Emirates has been offering a return fare of Rs 33,000 (plus taxes) since January. 

 The Air-India offer will be valid till May 31. It might be extended later, said an airline official.

 BAs fare will be effective through the summer. 

 Around 18,000 people from Calcutta go to the US every year. Southeast Asia, closer home and less expensive to reach, draws around 100,000 tourists from this part of the country. 

 The airlines want to break the perception that US tickets are very expensive, a travel industry source said. 

 The new fares would attract more tourists. Last-minute decision-makers might change their plans now, said Anil Punjabi, the eastern region chairman of the Travel Agents Federation of India. 

 Amanda Amos, BAs area commercial manager, South Asia, said: The leisure market in India is growing strongly. To make the most of the value-for-money offer, people need to book early.

 BA is also upgrading its in-flight entertainment menu with over 100 films and TV programmes, games, radio channels and audio books.

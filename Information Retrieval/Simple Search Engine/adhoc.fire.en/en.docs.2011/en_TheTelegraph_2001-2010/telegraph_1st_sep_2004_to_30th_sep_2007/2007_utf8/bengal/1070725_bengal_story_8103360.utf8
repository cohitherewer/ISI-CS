 Looting on train from Howrah

 OUR BUREAU

 July 24: A gang struck on a train from Howrah early today, looting Rs 40,000 from passengers at gunpoint and injuring two who resisted.

 The incident took place in the general compartment of the Guwahati-bound Saraighat Express just after it crossed Kumedpur station in Malda district around 1.30 this morning. 

 The miscreants, believed to be seven to eight, boarded the train disguised as passengers at Malda station. The train was to have stopped at Kishanganj in Bihar before New Jalpaiguri. The gang forced a passenger to pull the chain and slipped into the darkness somewhere between Suryakamal and Kanki in North Dinajpur district, just before Kishanganj.

 I was asleep and woke up to a blow on my stomach. Before I realised what was going on, more blows rained down on me. I also saw a gun trained on me. They took away whatever cash I had in my pocket, said Himangshu Biswas, a businessman from Baneshwar in Cooch Behar. 

 The compartment did not have police protection when the incident took place. 

 Biswas was among the 60-70 passengers robbed. The ordeal lasted one-and-a-half hours. I saw a group of youths speaking Hindi and Bengali and beating up our fellow passengers. They were armed with guns, daggers and lathis, said Nabonita Deb, a resident of Farakka who was on her way to Uttar Banga Krishi Viswavidyalaya.

 Lalmohan Rajwar, from Purulia, also on way to Cooch Behar, said he was robbed of Rs 6,500. He lodged a complaint with railway police when the train reached New Jalpaiguri at 5.30am.

 D. Kholi, the additional chief security commissioner of the Northeast Frontier Railway, said he has asked the divisional security commissioner to conduct an inquiry. 

 We suspect that the dacoits are from places like Goalpokhar, Kanki and Islampur in North Dinajpur, he said.

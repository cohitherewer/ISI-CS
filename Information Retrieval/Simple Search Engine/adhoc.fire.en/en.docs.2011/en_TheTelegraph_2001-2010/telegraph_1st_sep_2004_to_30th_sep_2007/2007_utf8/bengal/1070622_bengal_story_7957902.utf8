 Warder in jail

 Calcutta, June 21: Presidency Jail warder Bijoy Singha Roy was arrested today after a surprise check by jail authorities yielded 800 gm of cannabis and four packets of heroin from his possession.

 The raid was organised after jail officials were tipped off that drugs and SIM cards were being smuggled in for inmates. A departmental inquiry has been initiated against Roy.

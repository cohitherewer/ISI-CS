The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 All await ammo from court

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, May 4: For once, political parties would not mind a dash of judicial activism. But the bench has not obliged them yet.

 Nandigrams recurring cycle of violence has compelled parties of all hues to look to- wards the court for directives that may be politically untenable but legally enforceable.

 Most parties had hoped for an explicit order from the high court yesterday. The government wanted it to call for central forces since police were not being allowed to enter the villages of Nandigram.

 The Opposition also wanted paramilitary forces not in Nandigram but in adjoining Khejuri, where the CPM refugees have pitched camp.

 On record, few officials or party leaders would confirm they want central forces to step in no state government can afford to say that.

 But the CPM came close: the party has made no secret of its wish that if the court gave a directive, the state would send in police to ensure that 3,000 supporters could return home. 

 The character of the enforcement agency central or state is a matter of dispute but the CPM agrees that force should be used, if the court so orders.

 The CPM usually does not betray such deference to unfavourable judicial pronouncements. However, after the backlash that followed the aborted police action last time, the party would like to have a shoulder to fire from. 

 But the court disappointed both the Trinamul Congress, which wanted the CPM stronghold to be declared a disturbed area, and the ruling party.

 The high court asked the government to restore normality in Nandigram, without spelling out how the police should act.

 When we present our next status report in a fortnight, we will again say our police have not been able to enter Nandigram and we hope that the court directs us to summon central forces, an official said. 

 Former chief minister Jyoti Basu said the government would act according to the (high court) order to restore peace in Nandigram. 

 Other CPM leaders also said only the court can save the situation. If the court asks the government to stop the violence at any cost, the state police are competent enough to do that, party leader Benoy Konar said. 

 He indicated that any adverse fallout could be neutralised by pointing out that the government was acting on court orders.

 Mamata Banerjee, too, is pinning her hopes on the court. The Khejuri-Nandigram border should be sealed and the court should play a pro-active role, she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Meeting on island chem hub

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Aug. 12: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee govern- ment is considering Nayachar as Nandigrams alternative to house the mega chemical hub proposed by the Indonesian Salim Group.

 Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen, his land and land reforms colleague Abdur Rezzak Mollah and their departmental secretaries will meet on Friday to discuss the status of land on the island 3km from the Haldia port.

 No survey has ever been conducted on the island on the Hooghly. Although the land belongs to the government, we are yet to determine the exact amount of land available and its character, a senior government official said.

 Some of the land is with the fisheries department and some with Calcutta Port Trust.

 Getting around 10,000 acres on Nayachar may be hassle free, but there are concerns over the environmental impact of a chemical hub on the river island. Chemical industries will endanger over 10 varieties of mangroves growing there, said an environmentalist.

 Commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen has admitted in the past that it might be difficult to obtain the Union environment ministrys clearance for chemical industry on the island.

 Being only 100 years old, the mud island is also not considered stable by geologists. 

 Officials said Nayachar would pose additional problems in terms of accessibility. A island has its inherent accessibility problems. Any investor would have to first build a bridge connecting the island with the mainland. There is no existing infrastructure there, only mangroves and vegetation apart from a tourist bungalow and an aqua-culture project, said an official. 

 Salim Group officials, who have been sounded on Nayachar, have said they would have to check the viability of the site.

 The government has made it clear that the proposed petroleum, chemicals and petro-chemical investment region (PCPIR) will not have a special economic zone (SEZ) status as a whole, but would be divided into SEZ and non-SEZ areas. 

 The split will depend on the number of investors expressing interest since the SEZ would primarily be an export-oriented zone.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Molestation in CU lift

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 31: A girl was allegedly molested in a Calcutta University lift by a suspected student.

 The alleged assault occurred when the second-year postgraduation student was coming down in the lift after classes were over in the afternoon.

 Police said two boys were in the elevator. One of them tried to molest her while the other remained a silent spectator, the police added.

 The alleged molester initially made advances on the girl. When she ignored him, he started making obscene gestures, the police said.

 When the boy came too close, the girl had an altercation with him, following which he molested her, the police said on the basis of the girls complaint.

 Once the lift came down, the girl left for home without raising an alarm as she was worried about the consequences. The boys too had disappeared.

 After reaching home, she narrated the incident to her mother. Along with her parents, the girl reached Jorasanko police station and lodged a complaint.

 The girl could not name the boy, though she was sure that he was a student of that university.

 She has given a description of the student. We are trying to locate him, an investigating officer said.

 According to her description the boy was lean, wearing dark trousers, shirt and sandals. 

 From his dress, she is certain that he is a student of the university, the officer said. He said the police would visit the university. If necessary, we will draw a sketch of the boy and pursue the case.

 SFI attack on clinic

 CPM supporters vandalised a vaccination centre in Krishnagar and beat up a doctor after a nurse allegedly ridiculed their leader for marrying an upper-caste woman.

 Arup Das and his wife, who went to Krishnagar Maternity Hospital to get their son vaccinated for DPT (diptheria, pertussis or whooping cough and tetanus) and Hepatitis B, accused a nurse of ignorance after the child started bleeding.

 As they questioned the nurses ability to give injections and her intelligence, her colleagues sprang to her defence. Amaader nirbodh bolar age nijeke chinun. Hindu samaje apnader biye legal noi (Take a call on yourself before questioning our intelligence. Your marriage is not legal in the Hindu community), one of them said.

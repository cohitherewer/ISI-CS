The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 IIM team Italians harassed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept 16: An IIM team that included girls from abroad was harassed and a student beaten up in Canning tonight, police said.

 Two men were picked up and their motorcycle impounded by South 24-Parganas police for allegedly teasing the girls and beating up an IIM Joka student from Kerala around 8pm.

 Two Italian girls and the youth from Kerala had got off their car to buy soft drinks at Dockghat in Canning, 70km from Calcutta.

 The 51-member tourist team from IIM, which had members from Belgium and Germany, besides Italy, was returning after a visit to Gosaba in the Sunderbans.

 As the trio were buying drinks from a shop near a petrol pump in Dockghat, the motorcycle-borne men teased the girls. The foreign delegation has come to the IIM Joka campus on a student exchange programme.

 When the student accompanying the girls protested, an altercation and a scuffle broke out. According to eyewitnesses, the men beat up the IIM student, the police said.

 South 24-Parganas police chief Praveen Kumar said although the foreigners did not lodge any complaint, the men were detained on the basis of statements by some eyewitnesses. We have not so far started any case since nobody has complained, Kumar added. 

 IIM Joka representatives confirmed that some students had gone to the Sunderbans and there had been some problem near Canning. But, they said, things are okay. 

 Every year, students from foreign universities come to India as part of the exchange programme.

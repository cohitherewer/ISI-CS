 Window hit kills schoolboy

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Alipurduar, Feb. 25: A Class IV student who banged his head against a school window on Friday but attended all his classes after a sprinkling of cold water died yesterday.

 Ganesh Karjis father has filed an FIR at Falakata police station alleging negligence on the part of the Khawchangpara Special Cadre Primary School, 40 km from here.

 The headmaster had apparently asked the boy to open the doors and windows of a classroom, during which he hurt himself. 

 The teachers ignored the injury after first aid. The nine-year-old had his mid-day meal and returned home after school got over at 4 pm. 

 When Ganesh started vomiting in the evening, his parents thought it was something to do with the food he had at school. But then he complained of a headache and we took him to the health centre, father Naresh said. 

 A few hours later, Ganesh had to be shifted to a hospital, where he died. 

 The headmaster should have told us what had happened. I hold the institution responsible for my sons death, the father said. 

 Doctors suspect internal injuries. Police said a probe has begun.

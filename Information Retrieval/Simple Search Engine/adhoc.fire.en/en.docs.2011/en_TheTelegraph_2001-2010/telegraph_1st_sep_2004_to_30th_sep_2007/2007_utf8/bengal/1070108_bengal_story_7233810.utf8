 After caroms, cops grope in dark

 Nandigram, Jan. 7: Intelligence failure or complacency: for whatever reason police had no inkling of the violence that rocked this place today.

 It was no secret that the CPM had been gathering activists from nearby strongholds to regain entry into villages from where they had fled. Nor was it expected that the party would take a beating lying down. A day before, Opposition parties had gone back on their word to pacify villagers and had instead inflamed passions.

 So, why were the police waiting for matters to settle down on their own? Why did they not have a clue about the confrontation that was building up?

 It did not strike us that such a clash would take place in such a short time, said inspector-general (western range) Arun Gupta. Political leaders spearheading the agitation against land acquisition had assured us that they would pacify the villagers.

 The jawans, secure in their camp, played caroms yesterday.

 Their bosses did not react to the build-ups in the CPM strongholds of Bhangabera, Tekhali, Sherkhachak, Kurighat and Bangshubazar.

 We knew CPM workers had arrived from Khejuri to help those who had fled their homes. We thought they had come to provide them with shelter and food and plan ways with us to normalise the situation, a police officer said.

 It was foolish of the police to think that the CPM supporters were assembling to provide food to their comrades, said Bhabani Das, an SUCI leader.

 Most of these CPM activists are veterans of many battles with Trinamul. It was not surprising that they were preparing to strike, and fast, said Sheikh Sufian, convener of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee.

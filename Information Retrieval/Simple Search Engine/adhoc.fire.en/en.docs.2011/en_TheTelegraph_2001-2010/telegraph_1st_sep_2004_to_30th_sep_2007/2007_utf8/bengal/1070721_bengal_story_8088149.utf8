 Teacher beats, mother slaps

 - Banned by law, but caning continues

 Krishnagar, July 20: A mother slapped a teacher right and left yesterday for beating up her eight-year-old son.

 Debpranay Chowdhury, who is in Class II of Dhubulia TB Hospital Primary School, has a chronic lung disorder.

 His mother Baisakhi said the teacher, Maya Chakraborty, beat him up on several occasions in the past week with a wooden ruler or the blackboard duster.

 Both the teacher and the mother have lodged separate complaints with police. 

 Corporal punishment is banned and teachers might be expelled if found guilty. 

 But school education minister Partha Dey recently ad-mitted in the Assembly that te- achers insensitivity cannot be curbed merely by law. The government is planning anger management classes for schoolteachers, where they will also be taught how to deal with parents.

 The minister blamed teachers for the high percentage almost 40 per cent from primary to secondary school of dropouts in Bengal.

 Baisakhi said Debpranay had been taken to Vellore for treatment and doctors had underlined the need for care while dealing with him. 

 But the teacher repeatedly beat my son over the past week as she could not tolerate little boys being naughty. On Wednesday, she hit him with a duster as he wanted to take his midday meal home.

 Doctors had asked Baisakhi to ensure that her son didnt eat outside. But Mayadi became furious. She threw the duster at him and hit him with a ruler. 

 The boy had to be taken to a doctor as he started vomiting on returning home. Baisakhi went to the school to seek explanation last evening.

 The teacher refused to listen to me when I tried to tell her that my son was sick and needed special treatment. I couldnt control myself, Baisakhi said. If she could hit my sick child in such an inhuman way, I think I did no wrong, she added.

 Headmistress Gita Dutta said the teacher has gone on leave. She was humiliated in front of other students, Dutta added.

 Classmate Jagannath Roy said he saw both Debpranay and the teacher being beaten. 

 Dhubulia officer-in-charge Biman Mirdha said both complaints were being looked into.

 District primary school council chairman Bibhash Biswas has sought a report from the headmistress.

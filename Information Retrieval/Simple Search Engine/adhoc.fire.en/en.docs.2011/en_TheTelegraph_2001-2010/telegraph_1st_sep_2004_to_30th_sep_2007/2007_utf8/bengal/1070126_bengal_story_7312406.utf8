 Singur (Hooghly), Jan. 25: Farmers opposed to land acquisition in Singur twice set fire to fence posts at the Tata car plant site early this morning.

 Around 5.30 am, a group of villagers wrapped jute bags soaked in kerosene around 10 wooden posts and set them on fire at Beraberi, about 50 km from Calcutta. Police arrived about half an hour later and doused the flames.

 An hour later, a group of women came to the site and set fire to the posts again. The police gave chase but could not catch anybody.

 A police team later raided two clubs in adjoining Bajemelia in search of the culprits but did not arrest anyone.

 This is the third time that villagers have set fire to the fence posts since January 21, when the Tata Motors authorities performed bhoomi puja.

 In Calcutta, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee reviewed the situation with chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen and other officers.

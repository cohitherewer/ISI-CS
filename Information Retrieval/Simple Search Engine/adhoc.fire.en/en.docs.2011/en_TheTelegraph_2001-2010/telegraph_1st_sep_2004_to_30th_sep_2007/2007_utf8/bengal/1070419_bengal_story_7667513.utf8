 Three dead and seven hurt, pony on a stroll 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, April 18: Three BSF jawans on a motorcycle were killed this morning trying to avoid hitting a pony that had strayed on to the road and a truck speeding from the opposite direction. 

 Jaspal Singh, Ram Kumar and Rajendra Singh, all in their early forties, crashed into the truck, which slammed brakes in a hurry and crashed into a roadside ditch. 

 The brown pony strolled off the accident site unscathed.

 The truck tried to swerve out of the way of the motorcycle but could not. Seven people who were on the truck, including its driver and his helper, were injured. They have been hospitalised, said Sunil Guha, the inspector in charge of the Kotwali police station. 

 The jawans were apparently travelling without helmets. It is also illegal for three adults to travel on a two-wheeler.

 It appears that both the truck and the motorcycle had tried to save the horse. The truck lost control after the driver slammed the brakes. Local people told us that the horse had been drinking water from a roadside puddle when suddenly it decided to cross the road, a police officer said.

 We were going fast and could not imagine the horse will cross the road, helper Bhulu Karmakar said from the hospital bed. 

 We keep carrying out awareness drives to make people wear helmets and not use phones while riding, but in vain. Even jawans dont take them seriously, said a police officer.

 The deputy inspector-general of the BSFs Krishnagar sector, R.K. Hajila, said: Well ensure that not more than two personnel ride a motorcycle in the future. But the police have not confirmed yet whether the jawans were really without helmets, the BSF officer said.

 The trio was going to Krishnagar to buy a gift for a colleagues farewell.

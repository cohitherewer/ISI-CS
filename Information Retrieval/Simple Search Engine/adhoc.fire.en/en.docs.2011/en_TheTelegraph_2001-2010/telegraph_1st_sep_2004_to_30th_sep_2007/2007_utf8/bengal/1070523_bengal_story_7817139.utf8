The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Hoteliers son missing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 22: A hotel owners son, who left his Royd Street home yesterday afternoon to meet an acquaintance, is missing.

 Naiyar Ahmed Khans mother told Park Street police station late last night that he could have been kidnapped. 

 Police have begun a probe into the 23-year-olds disappearance.

 Weve learnt that Naiyar met one Shabbir Khan of Tiljala yesterday. Both are missing. Naiyar knew Shabbir, said deputy commissioner of police Ajay Kumar.

 Naiyars father, who owns a movie hall-turned-hotel on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, is apparently in jail custody in Bihars Gaya. 

 The Khans are locked in a dispute over their ancestral property there, said a senior officer of the Park Street police station. 

 The dispute snowballed into a fierce battle a few years ago and resulted in a murder. Among those arrested in connection with the murder were Naiyars father and one of his uncles, the officer added. 

 Shabbir apparently called Naiyar on his mobile yesterday afternoon and asked to meet him to help thrash out a settlement to the property feud. He asked Naiyar to meet him at Tiljala. When Naiyar didnt return home, the Khans called up Shabbirs home to find out his whereabouts, a police officer said.

 Deputy commissioner Kumar said the Khans had not received a ransom call till late tonight.

 This is the third suspected abduction in the city in the past few weeks. 

 Tahir Khurshid, the son of a Topsia leather merchant, was abducted from the Park Circus connector on May 4. He was rescued from the Bihar-Nepal border. 

 On May 12, Sujoy Yadav, who was a year and a half old, went missing from PC Boral Street in north Calcutta. The police traced him to Sheikhpura in Nalanda even before his abductors could demand a ransom.

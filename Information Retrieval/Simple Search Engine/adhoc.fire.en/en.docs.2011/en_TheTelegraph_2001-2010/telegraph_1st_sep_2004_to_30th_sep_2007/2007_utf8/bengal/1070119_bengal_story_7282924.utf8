 Calcutta, Jan. 18: Mamata Banerjee has told the Jamait Ulema-i-Hind that she would like to launch a joint movement with the organisation against the governments move to acquire agricultural land for industry.

 A letter from the Trinamul Congress chief was read out by leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee at a gathering of the Jamait Ulema-i-Hind at Esplanade today.

 The letter, addressed to Jamait general secretary Siddiqullah Chowdhury, states: As soon as I get well, preparations would be made to launch a joint agitation with the Jamait Ulema-i-Hind against the Left Front governments barbaric move to evict farmers in the name of industrialisation. I express solidarity with your organisation for having taken up the cause of peasants.

 Addressing the gathering, Chowdhury said the Jamait Ulema-i-Hind would welcome any organisation that pledges to fight for the interests of the farming community.

 According to Chowdhury, the CPM has lost the moral right to rule as it has now become a stooge of capitalists.

 Let this be clear to CPM leaders that Bengals soil belongs to us and not Alimuddin Street. The party has to realise that the government will have to look after the interests of the people and not of the Salims and Tatas. We are ready to join hands with any organisation which is against indiscriminate conversion of agricultural land for industry, Chowdhury said.

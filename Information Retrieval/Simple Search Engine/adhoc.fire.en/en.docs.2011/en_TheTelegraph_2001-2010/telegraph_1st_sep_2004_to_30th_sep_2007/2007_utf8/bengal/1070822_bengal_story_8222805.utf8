The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Business first, Buddha skips date in Delhi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Shinzo Abe 

 Calcutta, Aug. 21: For Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, it is business first.

 He is skipping the crucial CPM central committee meeting in Delhi from tomorrow to discuss the nuke row and hosting the Japanese Prime Minister instead, with an eye on more investment. 

 Even if protocol is cited as reason for the chief minister staying back, the decision not to put off the cabinet meeting tomorrow to discuss a slew of business proposals indicates his priorities. 

 The cabinet will tomorrow approve proposals for investment of over Rs 38,000 crore. 

 Shinzo Abe will be here on Thursday. Bhattacharjee will receive Abe at the airport, join him at the opening of the Indo-Japan Cultural Centre at Salt Lake and host a lunch in his honour later. 

 We value the Japanese as investors and the chief minis-ter is likely to discuss further extension of co-operation following their funding for the East-West Metro, industries minister Nirupam Sen said. 

 No specific industrial project is likely to figure in the talks, though. There is little scope for it during such a short visit, Sen said. Abe will be in the city for a few hours.

 Sen will leave for Delhi tomorrow morning. State party secretary Biman Bose and the other central committee members from the state left this afternoon. 

 From Jyoti Basu and Biman Bose to Benoy Konar, the senior party secretariat member, no CPM leader had any doubt that Bengals industrialisation should not be linked with the survival of the central government. The flow of investment in Bengal or any other state is no more determined by the government at the Centre, Sen said. 

 Konar denied the existence of a Bengal line in the partys central leadership. He cited the debate in the party on a coalition central government headed by Jyoti Basu a decade ago and the split in the Bengal party unit on the issue.

 Chemical hub: Bhattacharjee today said he would call an all- party meeting soon to discuss the proposed chemical hub near Haldia. He didnt give a date, but sources said it could be finalised at the cabinet meeting.

 Midnapore, July 22: Haldia today voted in peace to pick its next municipal board amid the ring of gunshots and blasts in Nandigram, across the river Haldi. 

 Over 86 per cent votes we-re polled, subdivisional officer Shankar Haldar said.

 The results will be declared on Wednesday. 

 The turmoil in Nandigram and the governments industrialisation drive had been the main issues on which the civic polls were fought.

 Some Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee members tried to sneak into Haldia this morning. Police launches on patrol chased them away, additional superintendent of police Tanmoy Roy Chowdhury said.

 In Nandigram, Pratirodh Committee and CPM supporters exchanged fire and hurled bombs at each other in short bursts till afternoon. 

 The spurt in violence could be a show of strength on the day of the polls. No one was injured.

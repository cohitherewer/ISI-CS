 Dad beaten, books burnt but triumph in HS

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Nandigram, June 1: A girl whose father fled home after being beaten up for supporting the CPM only months before her HS was in tears today but they were of joy.

 Ananya Bera has scored high second-division marks.

 Her brother Arpan, a second- year science student of Nandigram College, called home at 4 pm today to break the news the only good one for the family in months.

 Their father Asoke was the chief of the Nandigram panchayat samiti. Our house was attacked thrice since January 7 and we were thre- atened by the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee almost every day, sobbed Ananya, a student of Samsabad Dhanyakala Vidyapith, 140 km from Calcutta. 

 Asoke was attacked on Janu- ary 8. I couldnt study for several days after that. My father now lives in a refugee camp in Tekhali, said Ananya. 

 Her triumph over odds in the war zone was not the only one. Even the HS council recognised the grit of students there. We are happy. The performance of students in Nandigram is very good despite the trouble there when the examination was in progress. It is really encouraging, council president Gopa Dutta said.

 In terms of district-wise performance, a council official said, East Midnapore has come third with 80 per cent students clearing the exam. The highest pass percentage is in Calcutta 86.85 per cent followed by Hooghly 81.06 per cent. 

 A majority of the 953 students who took the test from Nandigram were smiling today. Among them was Somnath Mondal, who scored 45 per cent.

 The son of a daily wager, the Kalagachha Jagadish Vidyapith student saw his books being burnt by a Pratirodh Committee mob. 

 My house was ransacked. I cant say how I felt. I fled to a CPM-run shelter at Takapura. 

 When the camp was attacked, he walked 20 km to reach an aunts house at Heria in Khejuri. 

 Subrata Maity, the head of Samsabad Vidyapith, was a proud man. Out of 33 students, 24 have passed. Some have scored over 60 per cent.

 Ironically, Pratirodh Committee leader Abu Taher almost claimed credit for the students performance. We had asked our members to ensure that our movement didnt hamper studies, he said.

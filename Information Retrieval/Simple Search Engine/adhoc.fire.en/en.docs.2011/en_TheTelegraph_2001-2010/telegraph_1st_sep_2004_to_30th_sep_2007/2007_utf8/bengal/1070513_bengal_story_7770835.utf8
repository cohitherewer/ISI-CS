The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Tolly studios on strike

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 12: Tollygunge studios shut down this evening after a section of technicians called a ceasework over a dispute with a rival union.

 Indrapuri, New Technicians, Bharat Lakshmi and a string of other studios, which have a packed schedule drawn up, will be hurt by the Federation of Cine Technicians and Workers of Eastern India strike. We are going on strike because members of the Broadcast Quality Video Technicians and Workers Association of West Bengal are often disrupting work. This is an old problem and there has to be a solution, said Partha Kar of the federation.

 Sushil Pandey, a production assistant for a Zee Bangla serial, was injured in a clash between members of the two unions on Thursday. Three members of the association were held last night.

 The association denied its role in the fracas at a peace meeting with South 24-Parganas police chief S.N. Gupta.

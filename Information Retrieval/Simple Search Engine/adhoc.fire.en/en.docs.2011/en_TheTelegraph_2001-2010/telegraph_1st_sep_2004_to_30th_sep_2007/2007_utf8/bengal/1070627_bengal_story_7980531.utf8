 Students let off, barring 1

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, June 26: Four of the five students thrashed by villagers in Katwa yesterday were released this morning after police interrogation.

 All are members of the United Students Democratic Front, a pro-Naxalite outfit. 

 We have released all but one as he is involved in some subversive activities. While three have gone home, one is in hospital with injuries, police officer Samir Basak said.

 The five, from Presidency College and Jadavpur University, were detained on the charge of inciting people whose plots were being acquired for a proposed power plant. 

 Of them, Jaladhar Mahato is in custody. A police team has taken him to West Midnapore for interrogation after he told them he is from Goaltore in that district. 

 Lokeswari Dasgupta, from JU, and Priyankar De and Supriya Sur both from Presidency went home today. Asim Debnath from Nabadwip has been admitted to the Katwa sub-divisional hospital.

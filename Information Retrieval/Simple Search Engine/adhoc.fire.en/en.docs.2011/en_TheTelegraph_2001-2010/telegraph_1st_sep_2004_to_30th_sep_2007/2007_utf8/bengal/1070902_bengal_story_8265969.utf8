The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 ID card must on CU campus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 1: Calcutta University has decided to provide students with identity cards and restrict outsiders entry after a student was allegedly molested in a lift on the College Street campus yesterday.

 Students will be allowed to enter only after they show their identity card at the main entrance of the campuses, said D.P. Dey, secretary, arts and commerce.

 Officials said the academic blocks at all the seven campuses would be completely out of bounds for outsiders. They would be screened before they are allowed to enter the administrative buildings.

 The girl who complained of the molestation had said the attacker was probably a student. But university officials today said their preliminary investigations suggested the youth was likelier to have been an outsider.

 A meeting will soon be held with the employees unions to discuss whether a security agency can be hired. 

 The existing security ar- rangements are inadequate. Outsiders can freely enter our College Street campus and many other campuses and loiter inside. This has to stop, Dey said.

 Private guards now man the universitys Alipore, Baruipur and Biharilal College campuses, but officials admitted that security was still lax because the rules were not being followed strictly.

 The University Grants Commission has made it mandatory for educational institutions to introduce measures to prevent sexual harassment of students and employees.

 The molested girl, who had gone home after the afternoon incident, had returned to lodge a complaint with Jorasanko police last night.

 She said a young man whom she did not recognise had followed her into the lift, molested her and run out when it stopped on the next floor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CPM amp; Cong together in House

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Pratibha Patil

 Calcutta, July 10: Left Front and Congress legislators will together meet Pratibha Patil in the Assembly on Friday to assure her full support in the July 19 poll for President.

 When chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee suggested a joint meeting earlier, several Left MLAs took him by surprise, citing ideological differences and rejecting it.

 We finally convinced the Left Front legislature party, particularly some CPM members, that Pratibha Patil is a UPA-Left candidate and holding a joint session shouldnt be a problem, a senior Congress MLA said. 

 Asked about the meeting on Friday, front chief whip Syed Mohammad Masih told the Assembly today that the need of the hour is to put up a united show of strength. 

 Thats why both Congress and front MLAs would have a joint session with Pratibhaji in the Assemblys council chamber. She is the UPA candidate and requires our joint support. I have issued a whip to our MLAs to attend the meeting, Masih, a CPM member, added. 

 We may be supporting the UPA candidate out of national political compulsions. But it will send a wrong message to our supporters if we sit together with the Congress members to listen to her, the RSPs Tapan Hore had said earlier.

 CPI leader and civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee and CPM members like Kanti Ganguly echoed the view. Its better to meet her separately to avoid confusion, Ganguly, also a minister, told Bhattacharjee.

 Such misgivings were not on display, though, when the CPMs Sitaram Yechury and the CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta signed Pratibhas nomination papers the same ones that were signed by Sonia Gandhi.

 The chief minister, however, did not share the sentiments of his Bengal comrades. We are supporting the Congress and its candidate in Delhi. Why should you feel uncomfortable about meeting her here? he asked the front MLAs.

 The Trinamul Congress legislature party scoffed at the Congress and the fronts decision to have the joint session. The state party unit would lose the moral right to speak against the CPM in the House, MLA Partha Chatterjee said. Was it really necessary? Would it be able to fight the CPM after the joint show of strength? It would cease to be an anti-CPM force in Bengal, he added.

 Another Trinamul leader, however, said it would not be prudent to criticise the Congress at a time when the two Opposition parties have shown the inclination to strike seat-sharing deals at the ground level.

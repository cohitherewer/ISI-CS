The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Summer crisis staring at state

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 27: Severe power cuts are likely to torment Bengal this summer with an expected shortfall in the region of 400 mw during evening peak hours.

 In Calcutta, the evening deficit has already crossed 100 mw with the state electricity board imposing heavy restrictions on its supply.

 The shortfall in CESC-supplied areas this evening was 142 mw. The deficit in the districts: around 250 mw. 

 Fearing a massive shortfall with the rise in the mercury level, CESC has made arran-gements to buy about 100 mw from other states from next month.

 Even after that, it will be difficult to completely avo-id power cuts in the city, said Pradip Basu, CESCs executive director (distribution). 

 Officials of the power supply agencies said the government had planned to start three heavy-duty thermal power units at Bakreswar, Santaldih and Sagardighi by March. 

 Chinese company Dong Fang is building the 300-mw Sagardighi unit. The 210-mw plant at Bakreswar and the 250-mw one at Santaldih are being set up by Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel).

 But the units were delayed as the supply of equipment was delayed. Land acquisition at Sagardighi, a greenfield project, also took time, said S. Mahapatra, managing director of the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited.

 Power minister Mrinal Banerjee admitted that the situation would be tough this summer, but held out hopes that things would improve from July.

 We plan to start the first 225-mw hydel unit at Purulia by end-June. So, the situation should improve from July. We held a trial run of the unit today. However, many more trial runs will have to be made, said Banerjee.

 The minister added that the government had tried to buy power from other states, but failed. We are now importing a small amount from Kashmir, but that is inadequate.

 According to power department officials, the demand during the evening peak hours this summer has been calculated at over 4,200 mw, about 400 more than last year.

 Also, our mainstay, the 210-mw thermal unit at Bandel, is yet to be repaired. Its turbo-generator suffered a fault and was burnt last year. If the unit was working, we could have tackled the situation better, an official said.

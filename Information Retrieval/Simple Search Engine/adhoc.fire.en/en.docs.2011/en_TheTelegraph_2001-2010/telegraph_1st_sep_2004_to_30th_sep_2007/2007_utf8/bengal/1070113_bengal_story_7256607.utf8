 Nandigram/Calcutta, Jan. 12: 

 Opposition leaders today skipped a meeting called by the 

 Haldia subdivisional officer to draw up a blueprint for 

 the repair of roads dug up by villagers.

 They were busy with a rally addressed by (social activist) Medha Patkar. We will hold the meeting tomorrow, the officer said.

 The CPM folded up its camps at Tekhali and Kansadua today after being told to do so by police.

 At Kalicharanpur, some people set fire to a tea stall whose owner Trilochan Shith Das did not join an anti-acquisition procession. 

 At Writers, the home secretary said no arrest will be made in connection with the violence of January 8 until peace is restored.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Man left to die outside hospital 

gate

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bolpur, April 4: A 60-year-old man left unattended at the Suri district hospital gate was found dead this morning.

 The bearded man with an unkempt look had been sitting with his chin buried between his knees in front of the hospitals second gate till Tuesday afternoon. 

 Apparently ill, he lay there all night without food and water. This morning, he was still there, but dead, flies swarming his body.

 Witnesses said he didnt get treatment, though he was yards from the emergency wing. The man looked ill and was sitting quietly in front of the gate. Around 8 last night, he lay down, said tea stall owner NoorUddin, who was too busy to help him initially. Around 10 pm, I did ask the man if he needed anything. But there was no answer.

 While NoorUddin made an effort, others didnt even cast a second glance. 

 Alam Chowdhury, who works in a cycle-repairing shop near the hospital, said he saw a few doctors drive past the man. I didnt recognise the doctors, but at least three of them drove in last evening. No one stopped.

 This morning, hawkers took the body to the hospital. 

 Post-mortem reports said a cardiac arrest was the cause of death. With none to identify him, the hospital put him down as a beggar in its records. Superintendent Arunlal Mondal said he hadnt heard about him yesterday.

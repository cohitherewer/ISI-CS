The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Shot amp; stabbed, but knife stuck

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, April 11: The ignition on, a red Maruti was waiting for Pradip Roy at the park near his house when he went there last night. One of its windows rolled down as he neared it and a revolver nozzle looked him in the eye.

 Roy, a government clerk who also had construction materials business, was shot twice and stabbed in an upscale Kalyani neighbourhood.

 The assailants must have thought he was dead. But they left behind a telling clue in the dagger, which got stuck in his tummy. 

 Residents of the otherwise serene B block, who were alerted by the sound of gunshots, took Roy to hospital, where he died about an hour later, around midnight. 

 In his dying statement, Roy, 40, told the police that a person who owed him money and promised to return Rs 60,000 had called him and asked him to come to the park, half a kilometre from his house. The assailants took his phone away.

 An upper division clerk in the animal resources development department, Roy had two sons aged 12 and 4. Neither the children nor their mother had been told until late tonight that he had passed away.

 Nadia superintendent of police H.K. Kusumakar said: He wanted his money back from promoters, whom he gave building materials on credit. He also paid advance to some brick kiln owners but did not pick up the consignments and wanted the money back.

 Roys friend Samarjit Kar, a schoolteacher, said he had made a lot of money cashing in on a boom in the construction business in Kalyani. Dada had started business before he joined service 12 years ago, said Roys brother Prabir.

 Three people Roys tenant and two others, who the police said are involved in construction have been detained. 

 The murder has shaken up the neighbourhood of mostly retired government officers, teachers, doctors or scientists. Law and order had been a concern for us because our area is desolate after dark, but we never thought there could be a murder, said Tapan Maity, an agriculture scientist.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cricket clash

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 5: A 43-year-old man was attacked with a chopper in Ekbalpore when he tried to save his son from a group of youths who were beating him because he refused to play cricket with them.

 Rezwan Ahmed, the injured father, had to receive six stitches on his head. A complaint against the four youths all in their early 20s was lodged at Ekbalpore police station.

 Earlier this week, a teenager died after being hit with a stump during a brawl on the Maidan. Another teenager had been the victim of a disputed lbw decision last month.

 Police said Mohammad Irfan, 12, was on a swing at the Banwari Singh playground when the group asked him to be their wicketkeeper. 

 When the boy refused, they started beating him. Rez-wan heard about it and rushed to the ground, said an officer.

 One of the youths took out a chopper and struck Rezwan on his head. As he slumped to the ground, the youths fled. Locals then took Rezwan to a nursing home nearby.

Calcutta, Jan. 1: When it comes to future plans, engineering is high on the list of students across Bengal. But private engineering colleges in the state are not where they would like to pursue the course.

 The reason: lack of proper infrastructure and qualified teachers. 

 Most of Bengals private engineering colleges also la- ck well-equipped laboratories, proper hostel facilities or libraries with a good collection of engineering books and current journals. 

 So much so that the CPM students wing Students Federation of India (SFI) has demanded a thorough review of the engineering education system. 

 The results this year show that over 50,000 students on the JEE merit list had not accepted the seats offered to them this time. Where have these students gone? Why havent they accepted the seats? asked SFI state president Sudip Sengupta. 

 To fill up some 15,000 engineering seats in the state, nearly 70,000 students had to be interviewed last year.

 The industrial scene in Bengal is changing and the state will need a large number of efficient engineers in the coming years. We must examine why students on top of the JEE merit list are not showing interest in joining our engineering institutions, Sengupta said.

 At a convention, to be organised by the SFI this month, higher education minister Sudarshan Roy Chowdhury, IT minister Debesh Das, the vice-chancellors of universities offering engineering courses, representatives of private engineering colleges and education department officials will discuss the ills plaguing tech colleges in Bengal.

 Lets see what emerges from the convention. We can act accordingly, Roy Chowdhury said.

 The central selection committee of the joint entrance examination (JEE) board that conducts engineering entrance tests said it could not bring about a change on its own. Our job is to place students on the basis of their ranks. We cannot help it if they do not turn up, said co-ordinator Ajit Chattopadhyay.

 Board officials, however, admitted that government- aided institutions such as the Bengal Engineering and Science University and Jadavpur University are more in demand because they offer better facilities.

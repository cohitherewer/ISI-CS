 Nandigram, Jan. 13: The impasse over reopening roads in the five troubled villages of Nandigram continued today, with Opposition parties saying they need more time to convince the protesting farmers. 

 We were ready to go for road repairs around 3 pm today, but the main political parties heading the agitation the Trinamul Congress, Jamait Ulema-i-Hind and the SUCI declined to go there and convince the villagers, said sub-divisional officer Shankar Haldar.

 At a meeting with Haldar this afternoon, the Opposition leaders heading the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee (BUPC) had agreed to begin repairing roads. 

 Farmers opposing land acquisition for the special economic zone to be set up for the Indonesia-based Salim Group had dug up the roads to deny access to police. 

 It was decided at the meeting that the demolished Basulichak-Lockgate culvert would be fixed first. The administration wanted to get to work this evening as the Basuli Devi Mela begins tomorrow. 

 However, when the BUPC leaders sent feelers to the farmers in Dinabandhupur, near Lockgate, they made it clear it that they were not in the mood to oblige. 

 We need more time to convince the farmers. They do not trust the administration and dont want to open the roads for fear of police action. We cannot rush them or something untoward might take place. Weve spent the day talking to them and will resume talks again tomorrow, said Sheikh Abu Tahir, the Trinamul block president. 

 The parties have agreed to form peace committees in each of the five troubled villages Sonachura, Kalicharanpur, Bhekutia, Kendiamari and Mohammadpur to bring back the families of CPM supporters and leaders who had fled their homes and sought refuge in party-run camps. 

 Earlier today, top CPI leaders who were huddled in a primary school near Dinabandhupur had to leave after villagers gheraoed the headmaster for declaring a holiday to make room for the meeting. 

 Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee, who was in Siliguri today, said he would file a PIL against the state government for its shoddy handling of the violence in Nandigram.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 No talks minus Singur: Mamata 

 ANINDYA SENGUPTA ABHIJIT CHATTERJEE 

 Singur /Ranigunj, Feb. 10: Mamata Banerjee today said any resolution of the land conflict should begin with Singur, but chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee iterated the Tata Motors project would come up there itself.

 There cannot be talks with the government if Singur is excluded. I am ready for a dialogue if the government returns the Singur land to the owners who did not give their consent, Mamata (in picture by Pradip Sanyal) told a gathering at Boratelia, on the border of Singur block, 35 km from Calcutta.

 Nandigram and Bhangar can be debated but not before Singur is resolved. Singur marked the beginning of our movement against farmland acquisition, she said, at the rally where former Calcutta mayor Subrata Mukherjee made a surprise appearance.

 At Burdwans Ballavpur, 220 km from Calcutta, after laying the foundation stone of a power plant, Bhattacharjee asked the crowd: Tell me, do you want industry or agriculture?

 We want industry, the people replied in a chorus.

 See, this is the peoples verdict and we shall go by it, said a smiling chief minister.

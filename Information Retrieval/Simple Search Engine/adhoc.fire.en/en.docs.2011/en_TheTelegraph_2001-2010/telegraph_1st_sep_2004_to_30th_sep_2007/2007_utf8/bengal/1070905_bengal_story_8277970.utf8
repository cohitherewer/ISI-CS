 Sept. 4: A bus from Bengal hit a tanker, took a couple of somersaults and rammed into a truck on the way to Hardwar early this morning, leaving six dead and many injured.

 The tourists, from Nadia and Murshidabad, had left a fortnight ago.

 Among the dead, four were from Nadia Dinesh Biswas, 65, and wife Rekha, from Hogolberia, and Asima Chakraborty, 60, and Anima Pramanick, from Karimpur. Sadhan Mondal, 55, and Nisha Adhikary, 50, were from Murshidabad. 

 The bus with 50 people, travelling from Nainital, hit the stationary tanker at Narsan in Hardwar district of Uttarakhand. Four passengers were killed on the spot. The injured were taken to Roorkee Hospital, where two more died. 

 Ayodhya, Brindavan, Nainital and Hardwar were among the places on the tour scheduled to end week later. 

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb requested his Uttara-khand counterpart tonight to ensure care for the injured, 11 of whom are in hospital.

 Nadia district magistrate .S. Meena said Tehatta subdivsional officer Arup Sengupta is getting in touch with the families. We are find out about the arrangements to bring the bodies back, Meena added.

 Behrampore MP Adhir Chowdhury has left for Uttarakhand from Delhi.

 Dinesh and Rekha Biswass sons regretted letting their parents go. They had high pressure and diabetes and no experience of even travelling to Calcutta, Dipak, a farmer, said with tears in his eyes.

 The sons came to know of the mishap from television news channels this morning.

 My mother assured me that I would get a job if I had prasad from Hardwar, said Dipaks brother Soumen. 

 The Karimpur tour operator who took their parents has confirmed the deaths. 

 At Natna village, Asimas son Tarak, said the pilgrimage was a dream-come-true for her. He had struggled to arrange Rs 5,000 for the trip and was very happy to have been able to send his mother on the trip.

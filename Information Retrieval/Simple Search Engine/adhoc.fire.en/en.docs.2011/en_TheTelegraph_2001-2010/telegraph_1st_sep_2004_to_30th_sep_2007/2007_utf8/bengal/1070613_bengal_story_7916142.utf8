 CPM courts allies

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 12: The CPM has agreed to discuss with allies the package for Singur land-losers, shifting from the stand that the issue would be tackled by the government.

 The CPM today told its partners that a note being prepared by industries minister Nirupam Sen would be discussed at a Left Front meeting after the party examined it. 

 Party sources said the note would be forwarded to Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee, too, once it was finalised at Fridays state secretariat meeting. 

 Front chairman Biman Bose told me today that Sens note would be circulated among the partners before it is discussed in the front. But no date has been set, Forward Bloc veteran Ashok Ghosh said.

 Ghosh had called Bose this morning to urge him to call a front meeting to speed up the peace process. 

 Last Saturday, Bose had said the front was not competent to decide the Singur package and had entrusted the job with the government. Some of the allies had taken exception to the denial of the fronts authority to decide on policy matters. 

 Boses new gesture is being seen by allies as an effort to close ranks before hard bargaining begins with Mamata.

 The ball is now in the court of Writers. Mamatas refusal to talk to the chief minister is well known. Let Bimanbabu decide how the peace process will continue, Ghosh said.

 The allies criticised a section of the CPM state leadership for playing the Basu card unwisely. They first egged him on to invite Mamata. But later they refused to take a flexible position on Singur as he had suggested, the leader of an ally said.

 Basu has apparently accepted Sens arguments against redrawing the layout of the acquired area in Singur. But some state secretariat members did not rule out offering alternative land outside the project area but veterans like Benoy Konar are opposed to it.

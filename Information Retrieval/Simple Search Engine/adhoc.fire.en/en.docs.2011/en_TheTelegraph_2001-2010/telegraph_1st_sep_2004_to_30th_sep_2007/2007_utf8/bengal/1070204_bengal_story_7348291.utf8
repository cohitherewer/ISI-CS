The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Small publishers in protest fair

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Feb. 3: The Book Fair may have moved out of the Maidan, but controversy appears to be chasing it.

 A section of the Publishers and Booksellers Association of Bengal, which mainly represents small vernacular publications, including little magazines, today branded the Guild elitist and announced a parallel fair in protest.

 So, when some book lovers would go to Salt Lake, others might head to Park Circus Maidan or Marcus Square.

 Its a protest against the Guild. We are organising the fair for the sake of the small publishers and little magazines. Even yesterday, we wrote to the Guild enquiring about the fate of the small publishers. It didnt reply, alleged Joydeb Ghosh, president of the oldest publishers body in Bengal. 

 The dates and venue of the parallel fair will be announced on Monday.

 Ghosh insisted that the event was not being held to rival Calcutta Book Fair. Those participating in the Guilds fair would also be welcome to Kolkata Boimela. 

 The associations Bulbul Saha alleged that the Guild was working like a private club. It has not allotted space to small publishers and little magazines this time.

 The association has 2,500 members who put up 614 stalls in Book Fair 2006. It demanded that as the Guild is hiring the stadium free of cost, the Rs 5 entry fee be waived. 

 We wrote to them saying we were short of space. They wrote back with many suggestions and we said wed consider them, but they have announced their own fair, the Guild secretary said.

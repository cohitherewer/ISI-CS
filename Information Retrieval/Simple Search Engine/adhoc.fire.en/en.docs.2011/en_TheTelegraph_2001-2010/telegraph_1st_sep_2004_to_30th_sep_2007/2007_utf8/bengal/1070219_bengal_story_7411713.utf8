The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Parties in dock over exam bar

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Singur, Feb. 18: Two days before Madhyamik, the CPM and the Trinamul Congress have been hauled up for flouting sound bars in Singur. 

 Mamata Banerjee broke the norm at a rally near Kamarkundu station to oppose the Tata Motors project 5 km away and the CPM peasants wing flouted it at Joymolla, 200 metres from the site, in support of the factory.

 We have registered separate complaints against the CPMs Singur zonal committee secretary, Suhrid Dutta, and Trinamul MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya for flouting the high courts order on using microphones in the exam season. We will write to the pollution control board, asking it to take the necessary action, Chandernagore subdivisional police officer Kalyan Mukherjee said this afternoon.

 The complaints were registered against Dutta and Bhattacharya because they were the ones to go to the Singur police station to seek permission for the Friday rallies. 

 Mukherjee said the leaders were specifically told not to use microphones. If political parties flout the court order so blatantly, how can we enforce it on others? asked a senior police officer.

 Bhattacharya admitted that the police had told him not to use loudspeakers. But we had to use the microphones to pull the crowd.

 Police said Trinamul had used about 20 microphones. 

 The use of microphones is banned from three days before any major examination. 

 Trinamul leader Saugata Ray said in Calcutta: We regret the inconvenience caused to examinees.

 However, Dutta defended himself. We used a few speakers, which were set to a low volume.

 Reminded that the use of microphones three days before Madhyamik was banned, he flared up: You neednt bother. We will look into it. 

 Biswajit Mukherjee, a senior law officer with the environment department, said flouting the microphone ban could lead to five years jail and a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh.

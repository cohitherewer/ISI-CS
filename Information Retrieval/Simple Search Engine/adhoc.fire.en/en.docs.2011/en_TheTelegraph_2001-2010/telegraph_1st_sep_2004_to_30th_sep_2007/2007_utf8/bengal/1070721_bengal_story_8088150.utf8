 Srirampur (Assam), July 20: Four persons were killed as a bicycle bomb went off 4km from the Bengal border today. 

 Among the dead were 4-year-old Monmoni Khatun and 13-year-old Mandal Sheikh. 

 The casualties could have been much more had many people not taken an Alipurduar-bound bus minutes before.

 The blast took place in the chickens neck, which connects the Northeast with the rest of the country, near the inter-state checkpoint on National Highway 31C leading to Jalpaiguri. 

 Police said a paan kiosk and a temporary counter of the Assam State Transport Corporation were destroyed.

 The area was bustling with its bazaar and bus stop when people noticed the cycle, there for a few hours with a bag hanging. 

 The police were called around 10.30am. The bomb went off as personnel from the Srirampur police station were making their way to the cycle. 

 Abdul Majid, 22, and Munna Shah, 18, died immediately. Two of the 10 injured were policemen. All of them are in hospital.

 Subdivisional police officer Dungar Dhar Hazarika said it was too early to say what explosive had been used. 

 Although the police suspect Ulfa, they are not ruling out the involvement of the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation. It could be a joint operation, too, a senior officer said. 

 Jasmuddin Sheikh, the owner of the paan shop, said: I dont know how I survived.

 Prakash Barman, who has a medicine store opposite the bus stop, heard a deafening sound. There was smoke all around and the people were screaming and running. Then I saw blood and two bodies. 

 A second bomb exploded in a truck about a kilometre from here, 10 minutes after the first blast. Nobody, however, was injured.

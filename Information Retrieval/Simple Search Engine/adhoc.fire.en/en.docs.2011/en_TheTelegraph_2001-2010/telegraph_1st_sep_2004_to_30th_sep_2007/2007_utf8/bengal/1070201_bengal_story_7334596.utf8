The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CPM lines up class on industry drive

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 31: With speeches and slogans failing to make the desired impact, CPM leaders have decided to hold coaching sessions to train district units in ways to convince farmers about the need for industrialisation.

 The first class for six north Bengal leaders will be held in Siliguri tomorrow. 

 Farmers leaders Benoy Konar, Samar Baora and Madan Ghosh will be the lecturers with panchayat minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah. 

 The government needs to acquire over 1,000 acres near Siliguri for a special economic zone proposed by Videocon.

 Well have to explain to people how this transition from agriculture to industry is a logical and beneficial step, Mollah said. The example of China, which has succeeded in bringing about that change, is going to figure prominently in the classrooms.

 Party insiders said they realised the need to look beyond slogans such as krishi amader bhitti, shilpa amader bhabishyat (agriculture is our foundation, industry our future) after many from its own ranks joined protests against land acquisition in Nandigram. 

 During the polls, it was just a slogan. Now, we are compelled to go to the people. If we dont explain our stance to our mid-level leaders, who will address the farmers?

 The second session, for the south Bengal districts, will be held in Calcutta on Friday and addressed by the same set of speakers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Son-in-law turns gold bandit

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Feb. 2: A schoolteacher is on the run after a gang he had hired to loot his in-laws house was caught hours before the planned raid last night.

 Golam Ghaus of Islampur in Murshidabad was with the gang, too, but managed to give the slip. 

 Five dacoits all of them wanted criminals were held near the house of Golams father-in-law Salem Biswas at Gokulpur, about 225 km from Calcutta. 

 Two of them went with Golam to his in-laws apparently for a recce around 10 last night. 

 We were surprised that he came so late at night. There were two strangers with him. He accused us of spreading the word that he was a bad person. He left saying he had come all the way only to tell us this, said Salem, an affluent timber dealer.

 Having returned from there, the 32-year-old primary school teacher, who earns about Rs 7,000 a month, was telling the goons how they should go about their job. They were sitting on the roadside, waiting to storm into his in-laws house, when a patrol jeep from the Domkol police station was passing by. Our men challenged the gang and they started running. The goons were nabbed after a chase, but Golam fled. We are looking for him, said Bhaskar Mukherjee, the Domkol subdivisional police officer. 

 All five dacoits have apparently confessed to the plan. At the police station this morning, Salem identified the two who went to his house with Golam. 

 After his marriage to Roshanara in 2000, Golam, an arts graduate with a teachers training certificate, came to know that his mother-in-law had about 150 grams of gold at home. 

 A month ago, Roshanara left some of her jewellery with her mother. Golam planned the dacoity around this time so that his in-laws didnt suspect him, an officer said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Exam ends, dogfight begins

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, March 6: A day after the Madhyamik examinations ended, Nandigram erupted again, forcing police to fire in the air.

 East Midnapore superintendent of police Anil Srinivasan said the police had to fire twice when CPM and Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee processions were about to run into each other at Tekhali, the gateway to Sonachura, the scene of the January bloodbath.

 The fresh violence prompted armed forces to enter the pockets of Nandigram cut off since the land war broke out on January 3. At least seven people were killed in a gunfight four days later

 No casualty or injury was reported today, the superintendent said. 

 The region had been quiet for the past few weeks as both sides had called a ceasefire of sorts because of the examinations.

 Sporadic bombings and exchange of fire marked their end at Tekhali, Gokulnagar and Bhangabera. The tension that prevailed through the day peaked with the processions. RAF and Eastern Frontier Rifles jawans moved into the villages after the clash of processions had been averted.

 Sabuj Pradhan of the Uchchhed Pratirodh committee alleged that armed CPM supporters tried to sneak into Nandigram from Sher Khan Chowk at Khejuri this afternoon. We fear fresh attacks tonight. Over 4,000 CPM supporters have assembled there, he said.

 CPM leader Asoke Guria accused the committee of spreading terror. 

 Both sides complained that the rivals had stockpiled arms. 

 The police have not been able to arrest even one of the anti-acquisition activists accused of raping a CPM supporters wife and holding her family hostage on Saturday.

 Todays flashpoint was around 5 km from the epicentre of the earlier violence. 

 The chief minister has made it clear that no land would be acquired in Nandigram for special economic zones if the people there do not want them.

 Terminus shift

 Calcutta, Sept. 29: Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty today said the six-month high court deadline to shift the Shahid Minar bus terminus was not sufficient.

 I had said long ago that there was a need to shift the terminus, he added.

 The transport department has been trying to build a terminus in Dhapa, 3km from EM Bypass, on a part of the East Calcutta Wetlands.

 The plan for the Rs 35-crore project has been submitted to the environment department. Weve approached a Swiss organisation for an impact assessment, the minister said. 

 The court yesterday ruled that the Maidan terminus had to be shifted to save Victoria Memorial.

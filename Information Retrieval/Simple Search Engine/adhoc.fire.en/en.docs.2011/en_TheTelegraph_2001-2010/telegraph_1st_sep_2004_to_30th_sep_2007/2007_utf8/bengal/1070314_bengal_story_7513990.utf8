 Missing: All ministers

 Halim: Talking Tough

 Calcutta, March 13: Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim was forced to adjourn the Assembly for half an hour today as none of the 48 ministers was present.

 The House, which was scheduled to resume at 2.30 pm in the second half, was adjourned till 3 pm.

 This time, I have adjourned the House for only half an hour. Next time, if the ministers stay away from the House during the session, I will have to adjourn it sine die, the Speaker warned the government.

 It will be the governments responsibility to get the budget passed, he added.

 Asked why all the ministers were absent, Halim told The Telegraph tonight that laziness might be the reason. But I am not going to tolerate such an attitude. Ministers have to be serious about attending the House, he added.

 Halim realised all ministers were absent when the House reconvened in the afternoon to discuss the governors address.

 The Speaker later asked state parliamentary affairs minister Sailen Sarkar to ensure the regular attendance of ministers. Caught on the wrong foot, an embarrassed Sarkar said some ministers were present during the morning session.

 But the Speaker said: Ministers should be present in the House during both sessions. It is your duty to ensure their presence.

 Halim was apparently agitated since the morning when agriculture minister Naren De skipped the question hour. Questions on Des department were supposed to come up today.

 Left Front legislators are also upset at the way some ministers were playing truant. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had requested the ministers to be punctual. But his plea has fallen on deaf ears, an MLA said.

 Immunisation of children up to 10 years

Krishnagar, Jan. 24: The government has decided to set up clinics in every panchayat office to take healthcare close to village homes.

 These health centres will be run by the panchayats and deal with mother and childcare and treatment of uncomplicated diseases. 

 We will open these small health centres in all 4,000 panchayats and each of them will get Rs 10,000 a month for upkeep, said Bankim Ghosh, the junior panchayat and rural development minister. 

 He said the idea was to make the functioning of the rural bodies more effective. 

 One minister, Surjya Kanta Mishra, is in charge of both the health and panchayat departments.

 Our government wants the panchayats to become self-reliant and handle a vital issue like rural healthcare. In the long run, we also want the panchayats to run full-fledged hospitals, Ghosh said. 

 Now every block with- in which there are many panchayats has one primary health centre. 

 We will bring expecting mothers to the clinic and give them free medicines and vitamins before delivery. After delivery, we will monitor the newborns health and provide all vaccines, said a panchayat official.

 In Bengal, the mortality rate of mothers during childbirth is 266 in 1,000, which is better than the national average of 301 in 1,000. On the newborns mortality rate, too, Bengals figure is better than the national average.

 The chief minister has cleared the project.

 Ghosh said the government has already allotted Rs 100 crore and work on the project has begun. It is going to cost about Rs 8 lakh to build the new health centres. 

 In poverty-stricken Purulia, Bankura, West Midnapore, Darjeeling, Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri, the panchayats have been told to be particularly serious in monitoring villagers health.

 Gopalpur (Burdwan), April 2: She may have to live the rest of her life in fetters. 

 That is how Basanti Roy of Gopalpur, a village 25 km from Burdwan town, has lived for years. 

 Her family and neighbours feel she is insane and the chains around her ankles will protect her. 

 Basanti, 35, moves as far as the fetters would let her, washes her clothes and mumbles half sentences. She reacts ag-gressively to people taunting her. But all the time, she cares for her two-year-old son Bapan, feeding him, holding him at her breast. 

 More than a crazy woman, Basanti seems to be a victim of circumstances: a victim of abuse, she has been victimised further by the life in chains. 

 I have problems while walking, but they will not loosen the chains for a minute, says Basanti. 

 At 16, Basanti was married to Haru Roy of Sealdanga village, 30 km from Gopalpur. 

 Haru, an alcoholic who worked as a labourer in a soap factory, beat her often. His mother was also abusive. Basanti learned to live with that. By 19, she had a son, Shukho, and a daughter, Champa. 

 Some 13 years ago, Haru struck Basanti on the head with a bamboo rod one evening. She lost her mind after that. Haru sent her back, saying it was not possible for him to feed her any more, as she was incapable of working in the house or fields any more, says Basantis mother, Charubala. 

 Harus grandmother Ranu claims that Basanti had mental problems before marriage, but the others differ. 

 Shukho, now 17, who lives in Sealdanga with his father and stepmother, says: We used to hide behind the wall when my father hit my mother almost every day. We are not allowed to visit her now and dont know how she is. 

 He breaks into tears hearing that his mother has been chained up. 

 Chaining her up was a unanimous decision, taken by the villagers and her relatives with good intentions. Basanti was given medical treatment, but her family couldnt afford it after a while. 

 She has run away to far-off places several times, says Gopal Roy, her brother, a tube-well construction worker. 

 He claims that Basanti had Bapan and a daughter from unknown men, as a probable result of the sexual exploitation she was subjected to during her escapes. 

 Villagers add that Basanti killed the daughter a few years ago. We used to go searching miles for her, and bring her back home if we found her. But how can we always run after her or prevent her from getting pregnant? asks Gopal. 

 The panchayat and the village welfare committee claim that they have done their bit. The family gets Rs 500 from the panchayat, but if they have chained her up, we cannot intervene, says panchayat chief Golam Nabi Sarkar. 

 Basantis family gets a monthly ration, clothes and woollens. We have appealed to the panchayat to start her tre-atment, says Amarendu Krishna Kumar, the welfare committee secretary. 

 The two-member Gopalpur womens committee has very little to say. No woman in the village is aware of the new law to protect women against domestic violence. 

 We have forwarded Basantis name to the village welfare committee. What else can we do? says Santi, a womens committee member. 

 Her medicines cost Rs 300 a month. How can we afford them? asks Gopal. But she got better after a few months of treatment, he continues. 

 After recovering, Basanti returned to her in-laws, only to find Haru had remarried. Basanti was thrown out of the house and not allowed to take her children with her. 

 She became disturbed again. She is now under homeopathic treatment, says Cha- rubala.

 Mill roof traps four

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Howrah, July 31: Four labourers repairing a toilet in a 100-year-old Howrah jute mill were believed to be trapped in rubble till late tonight after its roof came crashing on them.

 Witnesses said the 2,000-sqft iron-and-asbestos roof in Delta Jute Mill, Manikpur, caved in with a deafening sound around 3.45pm. 

 Mill workers rescued Joydip Jana, but his helper was not so lucky.

 As the news spread, the mill workers attacked management employees, who fled. No one from the management was available for comment about the accident.

 The army is on standby. At least four persons are trapped under the debris, district magistrate Khalil Ahmed said. He refused to say whether they could be alive.

 Firemen, police and local volunteers were trying to reach the four till late tonight.

 It is difficult to say how many are trapped under the debris. We took up the rescue responsibility on ourselves as no one from the management could be traced, said district police chief N.K. Singh.

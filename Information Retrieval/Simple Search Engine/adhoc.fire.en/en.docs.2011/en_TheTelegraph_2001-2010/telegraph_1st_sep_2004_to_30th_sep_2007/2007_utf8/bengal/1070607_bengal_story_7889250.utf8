The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bangladeshi goon held in Dum Dum 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, June 6: A most-wanted Bangladeshi criminal, who had been staying in Dum Dum for five years and had set up a business here, was arrested today.

 Hariz Ahmed, for whom there is an Interpol red-corner notice, had been living in the rented house under an alias Mohammed Hasan.

 The man in his mid-40s is believed to have brought his wife and children to India recently. He admitted his daughter to a school this year.

 He has been booked for carrying fake documents and staying in India without valid papers. But he has several charges of murder and extortion against him in Bangladesh and he carries an Interpol red-corner notice, said Rajeev Kumar, a CID deputy inspector-general. Hariz figures on a list of 24 criminals that Bangladesh had handed to India recently. 

 A CID team tiptoed into his house near the airport and picked him up, a Dum Dum police officer said. 

 The police are now looking for his local contacts.

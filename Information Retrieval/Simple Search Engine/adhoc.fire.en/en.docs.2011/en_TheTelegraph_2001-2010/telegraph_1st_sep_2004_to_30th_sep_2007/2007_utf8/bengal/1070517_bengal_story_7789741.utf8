The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Govt plot gift before polls

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Calcutta, May 16: With the panchayat polls only a year away, the government has dusted off a plan to give land free to landless rural families.

 Launched in 2005, before last years state elections, with a paltry allocation of Rs 10 crore, the project promises up to 10 cottahs to every family now living on others land.

 Last year, Rs 20 crore had been allocated for the project. Only Rs 3 crore has been spent to buy land till now.

 Around Rs 47 crore has been earmarked for the purchase of land this year, a land and land reforms department official said. The government will buy land to rehabilitate the homeless, he added.

 According to the 2001 census, about 27 lakh families in rural Bengal do not own land. 

 With the money earmarked this year, less than 10,000 could benefit.

 Committees made up by panchayat chiefs and block development and land revenue officers would be set up to buy land from farmers at market rates, the official said. 

 They will also identify beneficiaries and act as the land distributing body. 

 With the Rs 3 core, land was bought in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore. 

 The beneficiaries refused to move away from their existing homes citing inconvenience. In the recent guidelines, we have asked the committees to scout for land in areas near the existing homes of these families, a land official said.

 However, the land will be registered in the governments name and the beneficiaries wont be able to sell it, like in the case of tilling rights (pattas) to the landless farmer, the official added.

 After the farmers resistance to land acquisition for industry, the government has also embarked on a drive to distribute pattas, the biggest since the land reforms in the 1980s.

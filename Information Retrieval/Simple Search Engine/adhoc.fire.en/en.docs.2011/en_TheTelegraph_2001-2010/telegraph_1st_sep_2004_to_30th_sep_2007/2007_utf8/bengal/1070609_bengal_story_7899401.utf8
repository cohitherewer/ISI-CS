 Reliance market revamp gets nod

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, June 8: The Calcutta Municipal Corporation mayor-in-council today cleared its deal with Reliance to redevelop the Park Circus market.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said the approval was unanimous. 

 The issue could not be discussed in the council twice earlier because of opposition from the CPMs allies, who feared that the right to redevelop the market would give Reliance Retail a backdoor entry. 

 However, a city Left Front meeting last week paved the way for todays smooth passage of the deal. 

 The mayor as well as other CPM leaders assured the allies that the contract would be restricted to redevelopment of the market and Reliance would have to seek a separate licence to open a retail outlet in it. 

 We have given the green signal to the Reliance contract today after getting the assurance that the interests of the unorganised traders and rehabilitation of the present stall-owners would be looked after, deputy mayor Kalyan Mukherjee, of the RSP, said. 

 We ratified the deal in accordance with the political agreement last week. Now we hope the mayor will place the draft of the agreement with Reliance before the city front committee before formalising it, as he had promised, said mayor-in-council member Subodh Dey, of the Forward Bloc. 

 Deals on all city markets would have to be approved by the front in the future. 

 The Mukesh Ambani-led group emerged the highest bidder for the market redevelopment under a private-public partnership policy that the funds-starved civic body has announced. The contract allows the private partner to retain a substantial portion of the revamped market and use it for commercial purposes, including setting up markets, malls and multiplexes. 

 Observers said todays decision would give Reliance the much-needed time to let the political storm over corporates retail foray settle down. 

 According to the agreement, it has two-three years to revamp Park Circus market. By that time, we hope there will be a central policy on retail, the mayor told the partners.

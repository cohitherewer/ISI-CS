 Negligence rap on cop

 Howrah, Feb. 22: The officer in charge of Amta police station, Rajiv Ranjan Singh, was today suspended on the charge of dereliction of duty following the death of a woman during a clash on Tuesday.

 Although he was informed about the incident, Singh did not visit Chandrapur village, about 57 km from Calcutta, where a mob of about 15 attacked the house of Marjina Begum, 55, over a land dispute. Marjina and five others were injured. She was shifted to the SSKM hospital, where she died last night.

 Marjinas brother Masud Halder lodged an FIR on Tuesday but the case was registered the next day, said Howrah superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh, adding that the OC did not keep higher officials posted on the incident.

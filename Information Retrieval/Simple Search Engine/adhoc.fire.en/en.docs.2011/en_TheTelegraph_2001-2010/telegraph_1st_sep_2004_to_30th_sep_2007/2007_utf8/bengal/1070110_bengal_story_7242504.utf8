 Comrade then, not now

 Nandigram, Jan. 9: Red flags bearing the hammer and sickle have gone missing here. 

 Instead, small saffron, white and green flags of the Trinamul Congress and red-and-white ones of the Jamait Ulema-I-Hind dot the place.

 With their leaders in hiding, many CPM supporters have decided to espouse the cause of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee, not as much to prevent land acquisition as to ensure they are not driven out or battered to death by fellow villagers.

 In the panchayat polls, I voted for Trinamul and got beaten up by the CPM leaders in the village. Now, those same leaders move around with our party members, said Subhas Kumar Pradhan of Kendamari. 

 I was a CPM local committee member and I believed that it was a party for the poor. But I want to live in this village and not take shelter in some faraway camp. Besides, I realise that what the Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee is doing is right. After all, our land is being snatched and sold to the rich, said Sheikh Nurul at South Khali village. 

 Pradhan said many CPM leaders switched sides overnight after the police lathicharge on January 3. Even panchayat member Haripada Maiti joined the committee that night. After all, he had to save his own 10-bigha plot, Pradhan said while cycling to a rally to be addressed by Congress leader Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. 

 South Khali, Sonachura and Gangra, the three villages under the Sonachura gram panchayat, are all on the governments acquisition map and are CPM controlled. 

 Over 200 CPM leaders have fled since the trouble last week. Around 2,000 CPM supporters have taken shelter in makeshift camps.

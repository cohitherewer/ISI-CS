The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Private school location curbs on the cards

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, June 22: The government has decided to check the mushrooming of private schools in the developed zones of the state so that education reaches areas where the literacy rate is low.

 So, unless private groups decide to set up schools in backward areas, they may not get a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the government. 

 The government has set up district-level school mapping committees, which will examine the area-wise concentration of primary and secondary schools. They will also identify the places where there is a scarcity of schools.

 The government has noticed that private groups are mainly showing interest in opening schools in areas where there are enough institutions already. There are many places in the state where there is very little scope for school education for local children. The governments move is intended to adopt a rational policy in the selection of sites for setting up schools, said Santosh Mahapatra, the joint secretary in the school education department.

 Private groups now have the liberty to select a location for a school. 

 Before seeking affiliation from a board, it is mandatory for them to get an NOC from the government. To be eligible for the certificate, the groups must show they have adequate land, infrastructure, teaching staff and funds.

 Now, the choice of site will also become important.

 There are nearly 16,000 secondary and higher secondary schools and 63,000 primary schools in the state. 

 The numbers are adequate to meet the states requirements, an official said. But the problem is that they are not uniformly distributed. 

 Some places, even in the rural belts, have too many schools and their classrooms remain empty for lack of students. Whereas, there are many rural areas that dont have a school and children have to walk miles to reach the nearest school, he said.

 The government is planning to incorporate a provision on selection of sites for new schools in a proposed act. The act, to be formulated soon, will ensure smooth running of all categories of private schools under the ICSE and CBSE.

 Once the mapping of schools is done, it will help the government check whether sites chosen by applicants for NOCs are on the list of less-school zones.

 Private groups running schools in the state feel the new policy would create confusion. 

 Normally in urban areas and in district towns, private groups set up schools at sites where there is a requirement. The move may discourage the groups from opening schools, an owner of a private school in Calcutta said.

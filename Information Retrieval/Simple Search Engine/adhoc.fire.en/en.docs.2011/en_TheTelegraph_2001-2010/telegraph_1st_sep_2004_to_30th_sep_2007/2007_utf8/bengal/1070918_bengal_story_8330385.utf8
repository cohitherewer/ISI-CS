 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Sept. 17: Swami Gahananandaji Maharaj, the president of Ramakrishna Math and Mission, is in a critical condition.

 He was admitted to the Ramakrishna Mis- sion Seva Pratishthan hospital on September 4 for treatment of an age-related degenerative brain disease. The 91-year-old Swamis condition deteriorated last evening. 

 At present, his condition is very critical and prognosis remains uncertain, said Swami Sarvalokananda, the secretary of the missions hospital.

 Calcutta: The city and its adjoining areas suffered long power cuts on Monday evening as the combined shortfall in areas served by CESC and West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company shot up to 733MW. A company official said supply from the National Thermal Power Corporation dipped as two 500MW units at Farakka and Talcher were shut down for repairs. The state units generated 100MW less.

 Durgapur: Simrendra Shaw, the driver of the truck that ran over Partha Burman, 38, on Saturday afternoon, sparking mob fury in which 16 trucks were burnt, was arrested on Monday. Thirty-one people have been held for the arson.

 Howrah: Sunil Hazra, 30, was found with his skull smashed and throat slit in a room earlier used as a kerosene depot in an Amta village, 50km from Calcutta. A liquor bottle was found nearby. Sunils friend Sugrib, who was last seen with him, has been arrested.

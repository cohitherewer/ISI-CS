The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 PM advice to CM

 New Delhi, May 6: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has revealed that the Prime Minister had advised him not to succumb to pressure against the Tata Motors project in Singur.

 I had a long discussion with the Prime Minister and he shared my view. He advised me that I should carry on and not succumb to anything, the chief minister told NDTV 24X7.

 Bhattacharjees statement confirms a report published in The Telegraph at the height of the Singur controversy that the Prime Minister shares the chief ministers views on the project.

 Bhattacharjee told the television channel that his personal prestige was at stake. The main issue is that if I roll back (land acquisition in Singur), I wont be able to raise my head my again.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 12: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today admitted that it would take some more time to restore normality in Nandigram as we are on back foot there.

 Bhattacharjee said this at a meeting of the cabinet core committee comprising senior ministers from Left Front partners at Writers Buildings.

 Last month, Bhattacharjee told a public meeting that the government had made some mistakes in Nandigram and learnt a few lessons. On behalf of the government, I am owning responsibility for what happened, he had said.

 At the meeting today, the chief minister had to face a string of awkward questions from front colleagues about the delay in restoration of normality in Nandigram.

 CPIs Nandogopal Bhattacharya likened the Nandigram firing with the Second World War and asked the chief minister when those who had fled their homes would return. 

 Bhattacharjee reportedly assured him that the government had begun a peace initiative by convening all-party meetings. More such meetings have to be convened in Nandigram. Although the Opposition has been skipping such meetings, we will have to ensure its presence at any cost. We will have to take everybody into confidence, a source quoted him as saying.

 Replying to a question from an RSP cabinet colleague, Bhattacharjee said there was a silver lining as some apolitical people had taken an initiative to restore peace in Nandigram.

 When the issue of widening roads to increase trade with neighbouring countries came up, PWD minister Kshiti Goswami said people were resisting acquisition of land after the Nandigram episode. In many places, people are demanding hefty compensation to give up their land.

 Singur villagers

 Villagers who have not given consent to acquisition of their land in Singur met governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi and told him they wanted their property returned and would not accept compensation cheques.

 The governor asked whether the villagers would sell their land if offered a higher price. But they said they wouldnt, leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mike menace with nod

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Murshidabad, Jan. 22: A soiree with a dozen loudspeakers blaring film music was held next to a hospital last night with the permission of the subdivisional officer and the blessings of the local police station.

 After over 40 patients of the Lalbag hospital spent a sleepless night, subdivisional officer Ajay Sannamat said he didnt know that it was located so close to the venue when he gave the show his go-ahead.

 The organisers were supposed to follow the norms and prevent noise pollution. If they have failed to do it, I will take strong action against them, he thundered today. 

 Six-year-old Piyush Kar- makar, who was admitted to the subdivisional hospital with chest pain four days ago and was diagnosed with a heart disease, begged his mother to take him home as he tossed and turned in bed last night.

 A dose of sedatives could not lull him into sleep.

 My son was feeling restless and ill. The songs grew louder as the evening progressed. Piyush held my hand and begged me to take him home. Ma aar paarchhina, bari cholo (Ma, I cant take it any more. Take me home), he told me repeatedly, said Piyushs mother, a resident of Lalbag town, about 220 km from Calcutta.

 Ratikanta Hajra, 62, is recuperating from a heart attack and is on saline drip. He tried to cover his ears with his palms. But I had the injection channel fixed to my left hand. So I could only cover my right ear, he said.

 When the hospital authorities were about to lodge a police complaint, they came to know that the subdivisional officer had granted permission for the show and the inspector in charge of the local Murshidabad police station had opened it.

 Who else could we turn to? asked a doctor.

 The medical officer in charge of the hospital, Goutam Pal, lodged a complaint with the district chief medical officer of health today.

 Our patients suffered immensely last night because of the noise, said Pal. 

 The law bars such a programme within 300 metres of a hospital.

 Inspector Sanjiv Dey, who attended last nights show, said he was not scheduled to inaugurate it. 

 The organisers requested me to deliver a speech so I went on stage to urge residents to maintain order and peace during the soiree, he added.

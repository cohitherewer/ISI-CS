 Durgapur, Sept. 4: Life away from home isnt milk and honey, Sabitri has realised sooner than a film heroine who runs away with her sweetheart.

 In a Bankura forest far from the Ranigunj circus that she fled with a wild tusker last week, 10 bull elephants are following her spoor.

 The high-hormone chase could be deadly, say forest officials, who have sounded an alert for forest villages.

 This is mating season. Theyve smelt Sabitri and are on her trail. Once they see her, theyll try to get intimate, resulting in a war, said Raju Das, the north Bankura divisional forest officer.

 The fight can easily spill over to the villages on the for-ests fringes. We cannot prevent the fight. So we have posted hulla parties, Das said.

 Teams armed with conch shells, drums and torches are manning the edge of the forests to drive the animals back.

 The tusker ambled out of Jharkhand, crossed the forests of Bankura, swam across the Damodar and entered Ranigunj in Burdwan on Friday. It left the town with Sabitri and re-entered a jungle in Mejia, Bankura. The couple have been roaming in the Mejia, Borjora and Gangajalghati forests, about 220km from Calcutta, since.

 The elephants following Sabitri injured a youth in Gangajalghati yesterday. He was admitted to the Bankura Medical College and Hospital. 

 Animals dont like to be disturbed during the mating season. They may turn very violent, said Das.

 Around 10,000 people are virtually spending sleepless nights. Many villages have formed their own night patrol teams. We are familiar with elephants straying into our villages. But this situation is different. We dont know what it will look like if a dozen start fighting, said Dukhyaharan Dhibar, 55, of Gangajalghati. 

 The DVC power plant in Mejia has been told to stay on guard.

 Sabitri and her partner were today seen playing in a pond in the Borjora forest. 

 Olympic Circus officials are camping in the area with the hope of getting her back.

 Kalimuddin, the mahout in charge of her at the circus, said she looked tired. She is not used to life in the wild she was raised in the tent.

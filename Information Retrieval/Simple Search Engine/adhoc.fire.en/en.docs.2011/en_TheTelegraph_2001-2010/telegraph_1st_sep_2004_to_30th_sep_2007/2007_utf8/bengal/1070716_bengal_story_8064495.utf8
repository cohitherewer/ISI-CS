 Flip-flop on varsity emblem

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Santiniketan, July 15: The Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor said no new logo was being designed for the university, two days after holding a news conference to announce the commissioning of a second emblem.

 In a circular issued under instructions from VC Rajat Kanta Ray, the university said the new portrait that was being designed will not be used as the logo of Visva-Bharati. 

 Ray had said on Friday that Kala Bhavan was designing a second logo, showing Rabindranath Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi and Buddha.

 Todays circular clarified that Kala Bhavan is trying to devise a triple portrait of Buddha, Gurudev (Tagore) and the Mahatma (Gandhi) for the vice-chancellors office and the office of any other officer who may be interested. 

 Nandalal Bose had designed the Visva-Bharati emblem (picture below) in 1921 following Tagores instructions. 

 University employees, former teachers and ashramites had opposed the VCs decision to get a second one designed.

 If he wants to keep a portrait in his office, we have no objection, but not if it is to be used as the universitys logo, said Debabrata Hajari, the president of the employees union. Kishore Bhattacharya of the teachers body, Adhyapak Sabha, echoed Hajari. 

 Why do we need another logo? asked Somendranath Bandopadhyay, an ashramite and a former professor. Son of Tagore biographer Prabhat Kumar Mukhopadhyay, Supriya, also an ashramite, said the plan sounded like idolatry.

 Suicide hint in wife letter

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Howrah, April 7: Police conducting a search at Jayanta Bags residence today found a letter, purportedly written by his wife Sutapa, which strengthens the suicide angle.

 Howrah superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh said the letter was found in a handbag along with some jewellery. 

 The letter, written in blue ink, is addressed to Madhumita Dolui, Sutapas sister. In the letter, Bags wife has asked Madhumita to keep the jewellery and two pet dogs when she will no longer be there.

 The letter indicates the familys preparation for suicide. But we are not ruling out the homicide theory altogether. From the very beginning, we were suspecting the daughter was killed. But we are not sure whether Bags death is a suicide or homicide, Singh said. 

 The SP was among senior police officials who visited the Bag residence for investigation.

 Singh also said Bag was not a qualified doctor and practised as a quack. We have come to know that Bag was a quack. He was not an MBBS and only got a first-aid certificate in 1992.

 Bag had slit the throats of his wife and daughter with a surgical blade, before taking his own life on April 3. Sutapa, the lone survivor, is recuperating in hospital.

 However, autopsy surgeon Harasit Sarkar claimed yesterday that Bag was murdered. The wounds on the body make it clear that it was not a case of suicide, Sarkar, who conducted the post-mortem of Bags body, had said. The police got the post-mortem report today.

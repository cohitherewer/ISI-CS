The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata 

 Calcutta, Jan. 24: Out of action since breaking her fast over Singur, Mamata Banerjee will make a comeback of sorts in Nandigram next month.

 Mamata will begin her fresh movement with a rally in Nandigram, where seven people were killed in clashes over land acquisition, MLA Partha Chatterjee said. 

 It has been tentatively scheduled for February 7.

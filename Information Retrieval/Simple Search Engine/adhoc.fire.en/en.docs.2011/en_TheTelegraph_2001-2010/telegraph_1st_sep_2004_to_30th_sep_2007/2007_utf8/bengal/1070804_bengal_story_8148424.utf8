 Chandernagore, Aug. 3: A doctor who allegedly molested a 19-year-old woman was today beaten up and had to be rescued by police.

 Debashis Chatterjee, 39, was thrashed by a group of 50 protesters, mostly women, who also ransacked parts of the Chandernagore sub-divisional hospital. 

 According to the complaint filed with the police, Mumtaz Biwi (name changed) arrived at the outpatients department around 12.30pm with neck pain. 

 I approached the doctor but he told me to wait. I told him I was in pain. He told me to go to the chamber upstairs and wait, said Mumtaz, the mother of a four-month-old daughter. She has been consulting Chatterjee for some time. 

 When the doctor arrived after about 30 minutes, he asked her to lie down and then started groping her. I was stunned. When he tried to grope me further, I pushed him away and ran out of the room, she told the police. 

 She went home, in the towns Urdibazar area, and returned to the hospital with the group of protesters, who dragged Chatterjee out of his room and started thrashing him.

 Hospital superintendent R.K. Sikdar called up the police station. The police had to struggle to free Chatterjee. 

 Sikdar called the district chief medical officer of health, Akhil Mondal, who asked him to conduct a probe. The report will be submitted within a week. 

 We have arrested the doctor on charges of molesting the woman, said Hooghly superintendent Rajeev Mishra. 

 Subir Roy, the officer in charge of Chandernagore police station, said Chatterjee, who is married and is a resident of Mahesh in Serampore, was being questioned.

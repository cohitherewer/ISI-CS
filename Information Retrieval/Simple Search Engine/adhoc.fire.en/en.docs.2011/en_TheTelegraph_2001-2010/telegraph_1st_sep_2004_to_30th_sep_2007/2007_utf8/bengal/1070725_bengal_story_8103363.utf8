The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Takeover pill for tea ailment

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 24: The Assembly standing committee on commerce and industry wants the Centre to take over north Bengals closed tea gardens.

 In its report, placed in the House today, the panel has requested the state to extend all possible support to the Union government for the takeover.

 The Tea Board issued a notice to the 13 closed gardens on July 9, threatening takeover if they didnt resume operations within 30 days. Junior Union commerce and industries minister Jairam Ramesh said the garden owners have been offered a package, which includes waivers and sharing of interest to ease their liabilities. They have to accept it or face legislative measures.

 Hundreds of tea workers and their families are now living in penury. 

 According to the Assembly panel, headed by the Congresss Sudip Bandopadhyay, over 550 workers have died of starvation in 15 months. 

 The report also alleged misappropriation of funds allotted by the state government for the starving workers.

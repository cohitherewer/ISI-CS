 Durgapur, Sept. 16: Police have arrested 28 people after yesterdays arson in Durgapur, where a mob torched 16 trucks after a lorry ran over a motor bike rider.

 The arrests were made from the villages of Angadpur, Arjunpur and Raturia all adjoining Durgapur in a night-long raid hours after the mayhem, possibly the biggest street arson in Bengal triggered by a single accident.

 Those rounded up were produced in the Durgapur additional chief judicial magistrates court today and were sent to judicial custody till September 27.

 Throughout the day, youths were seen camping in small groups on the Raturia-Angadpur Road, where the trucks were burnt following 38-year-old Partha Burmans death. The youths did not allow a single vehicle to ply the road. 

 The driver and helper of the lorry that ran over Burman are yet to be arrested.

 Most of those who rioted on the Raturia-Angadpur Road yesterday were supporters of CPM youth wing DYFI, which was holding a rally half a kilometre from the spot.

 Although policemen were nearby today, they preferred not to act against the youths. 

 We shall not allow any vehicle to ply unless the police arrest the actual culprits involved in yesterdays street arson. The majority of those picked up are innocent, said Bibhas Ruidas, a resident of Angadpur. 

 But D.S. Rudra, the additional superintendent of police, Durgapur, said he was not aware of vehicles not being allowed to ply the Raturia-Angadpur Road. It might be that vehicle owners were not coming out on the road fearing fresh assault, he said.

 Senior police officials led by inspector-general of police (traffic) K. Harirajan visited the spot today and later held a closed-door meeting at Durgapur police station.

 The Durgapur Truck Owners Association also decided against running their vehicles. After yesterdays incident, we are scared. We cant imagine how people could torch our vehicles one after another because one lorry ran over a biker, said association president Bhola Yadav. The owners of the 16 trucks lost Rs 60-70 lakh yesterday, he added.

 The Congresss labour cell president in Burdwan, Umapada Das, said: Those involved in yesterdays arson were supporters of DYFI. But the police are shielding them.

 Some residents in the Durgapur Chemicals colony Burman was an employee in the company fled their homes fearing police harassment today after last nights raid in which some of them were picked up.

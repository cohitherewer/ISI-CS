The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Land ceiling thorn in Tata 

garden plan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 8: A Tata Tea proposal for growing other crops on excess tea garden land has sent the Bengal government scurrying to scan the rulebook.

 Senior company officials today met three state ministers and asked to be allowed to grow alternative crops pineapples and gladioli were mentioned at four of the companys gardens in the Dooars.

 Its not the idea of alternative farming, however, but the area to be brought under it that seems to be the sticking point.

 In 2005, the state government had amended the law all- owing excess land with an industry to be put to alternative use. The condition was that the money earned from this would be ploughed back into the same industry.

 Under the amended law, the land and land reforms department allowed four tea gardens to branch out into tea tourism last year.

 These tea gardens, however, kept within the land ceiling, but the area under alternative farming in the Tata Tea gardens is likely to exceed the cap of 24 acres, a land and land reforms department official said.

 The Land and Land Reforms Act allows an exemption from land ceiling only for tea cultivation and not for any other crop.

 I told them that the land laws in Bengal are very strict. This is a sensitive issue and will require a lot of deliberation among ourselves, said land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah.

 The Tata Tea executives, who were accompanied by Indian Tea Association officials, had also met commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen and labour minister Mrinal Banerjee.

 The Tata Tea vice-president (commercial and projects), Anju Madeka, made a presentation on the companys alternative farming schemes in other states. She suggested the government and the workers could be made shareholders in the project.

 She said that in Assam, the company was growing ginger and green chilli on unused garden land and in south India, coffee and other crops.

 They have given us projections showing how the scheme would generate additional employment and how worker income would go up. We have to see whether there is any such provision in the Land and Land Reforms Act or elsewhere, Sen said.

 Keeping in mind the problems of the tea industry, the government had recently agreed to allow cultivation of other crops at closed gardens in Jalpaiguri.

 If this is allowed, existing gardens will be able to diversify they might hire labourers from neighbouring closed gardens, one of the Indian Tea Association officials said.

 There is a lot of unused land in the 158 enlisted gardens in Jalpaiguri. Around 10 to 15 per cent of land in the Dooars gardens is lying fallow.

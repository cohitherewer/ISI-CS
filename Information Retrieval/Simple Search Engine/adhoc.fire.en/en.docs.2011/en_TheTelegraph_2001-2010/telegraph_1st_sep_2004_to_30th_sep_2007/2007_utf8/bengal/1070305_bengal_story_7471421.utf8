 Bisons on the rampage

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Alipurduar, March 4: A dozen cows were gored to death by bisons that strayed into human territory from the Buxa and Titi forests this morning. 

 In the mayhem that followed, a bison was killed and two others were tranquillised and released in the forest.

 The group of six split into ones and twos and entered Birpara, adjacent to Alipurduar town, and neighbouring Chapatali, Pakuritala, Kuntirghat and the Mathura tea estate. 

 At Pakuritala, a bison that fell into a drain and injured its hind leg plonked itself in the house of Babudeb Roy. The animal lay in that position for close to three hours and died.

 Villagers had tied up the animals legs, but forest officers who took over three hours to reach the place could not say if they had killed it.

 At Chapatali, a panic-stricken bison attacked Dinesh Roy, who is now in a critical condition. The animal killed four cows before being tranquillised. 

 Around the same time, six other bisons killed cattle in the Cooch Behar division, some 65 km away.

 We are trying to send the animals back, said A.P. Singh, a deputy field director of the Buxa Tiger Reserve.

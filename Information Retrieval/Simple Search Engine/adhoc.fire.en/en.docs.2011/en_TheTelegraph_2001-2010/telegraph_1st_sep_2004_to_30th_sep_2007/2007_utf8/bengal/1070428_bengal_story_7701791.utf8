The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CPM wants Reliance amp; regulations

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Jyoti Basu: Reliance has the right to buy land... and do business here

 Calcutta, April 27: The CPM is likely to scale down its op- position to Indian companies in retail by prescribing curbs, having realised that it would be legally difficult to block them unlike foreign investors. 

 Allies opposition notwithstanding, the party would like to make room for Reliance and other companies knocking the doors of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 

 Patriarch Jyoti Basu made it clear today that the CPM would not mind Reliance making its retail foray in Bengal by rebuilding crumbling city markets and retaining a part of it for its Fresh outlets. 

 Reliance has the right to buy land and buildings and do business here. I was told that the company is following that path, Basu said after a CPM state secretariat meeting. 

 The company won the bid to rebuild the Calcutta Municipal Corporation-run Park Circus market two days ago. The deal, to be approved by the mayor-in-council, allows the company to retain 1.5 lakh sq ft out of the markets 2.3 lakh sq ft.

 The government was set to sign a pact with Reliance last winter, allowing the Mukesh Ambani-led group to retail farm products. But it was put on the backburner following differences within the CPM and the front. 

 We are preparing a policy to be placed before the UPA government. Well seek rules and regulations so that domestic giants cannot monopolise the retail business agricultural or non-farm at the expense of farmers and other producers and small traders, CPM central secretariat member and former MP Nilotpal Basu said from Delhi. 

 Jyoti Basu indicated in Calcutta the government has gone back on its move to provide Reliance land for its farm-to-food plates chain. The chief minister has told me that permission for such business has not been given, he said.

 But Nilotpal said: We are making no distinction between retail in non-farm and farm products. 

 Left allies Forward Bloc and RSP had accused the government of allowing a backdoor entry to Reliance after it bagged the contract to develop the Park Circus market. 

 Nilotpal said: Reliance got it through an open tender floated by the CMC. The civic body should decide whether to allow Reliance to open its retail outlets in the renovated market.

 The Bloc-controlled agriculture marketing board wanted to revamp the market jointly with the CMC, but mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya turned down the offer.

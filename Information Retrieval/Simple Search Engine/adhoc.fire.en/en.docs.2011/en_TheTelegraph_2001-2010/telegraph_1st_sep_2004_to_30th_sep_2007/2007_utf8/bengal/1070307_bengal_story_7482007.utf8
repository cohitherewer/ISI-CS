The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Woman shamed in square 

 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN

 Sagardighi, March 6: Village strong- men beat up a mother of two, cropped her hair with a scythe, shaved her brows and set her hut ablaze after branding her a prostitute here in Murshidabad last week. 

 When a bleeding and broken Saleha Bibi, 28, fell on their feet, the gang ordered her to leave the village in a week.

 Ratan Sheikh, Abdus Salam, Mahiruddin Qazi, Rezzak Sheikh and Rahmatullah Sheikh, all Congress supporters, were allegedly eyeing the patch of the pavement on which she lived with her children.

 Her husband went to Delhi to work as a mason and disappeared.

 A day after the torture last Monday, Saleha left home. She told sister Aleya she was in pain. Aleya, 35, who would have taken her to the subdivisional hospital, found her missing on returning home, having delivered bidis that she had bound.

 The following day, Salehas sons Latib, 11, and Matib, 7 set out in search of her on their own. Unfamiliar with the area beyond their village, Matib lost his way and went missing. 

 Latib, a Class IV student, returned to his aunt, but is in a shock and has stopped going to school. 

 Salehas elder brother Samir Sheikh, a daily labourer who lives in another part of the village, was initially scared to go to police. After a prod from some of the village elders, he lodged a complaint with Sagardighi police station on February 28. 

 None of the five he named has been arrested. A case has been registered. But all five are absconding. We raided their houses, but in vain, additional superintendent Shankar Chakraborty said.

 Neighbouring police stations have been alerted, said a Sagardighi officer.

 Samir, however, said the culprits were roaming fearlessly in their area. 

 The residents of Harhari village, about 240 km from Calcutta, were so scared of them that doors were bolted from inside when they pounced on Saleha. When daily labourer Ali Hossain tried to intervene, the five threatened to kill him.

 In husband Mostakims absence, Saleha earned Rs 30 a day binding bidis.

 She had been staying alone, it was easy to tarnish her character, Samir said.

 RSP leader Sadhan Roy said she was being pressured to vacate the pavement so that hawkers could take it over. They had been eyeing the footpath for years.

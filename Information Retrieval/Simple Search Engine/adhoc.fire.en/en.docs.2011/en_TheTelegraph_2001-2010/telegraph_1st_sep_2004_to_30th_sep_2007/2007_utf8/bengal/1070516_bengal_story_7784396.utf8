The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Teenagers held before pump heist

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, May 15: Five teenagers, who were allegedly about to raid a petrol pump, were picked up in a police swoop on Lake Town early this morning.

 One of the five said he was a student of automobile engineering.

 None of the 18-19-year-old boys Arka Banerjee, Samik Ghosh, Kunal Sarkar, Preetam Bhowmick and Debasish Das has a criminal past. They are from Dum Dum and neighbouring areas.

 Acting on a tip-off during a routine patrol, our team tracked them down near Bangur around 12.15 am, a senior officer of the Lake Town police station said. Their target: the pump at the Jessore Road-Bangur Avenue intersection.

 A single-shot gun and two swords were apparently found on the boys. 

 All of them but Arka, who said he was an engineering student, quit studies after school, the police said. They will be in jail custody for a fortnight. 

 Realising the police were closing in, three boys started running and two went into the pump. We chased the trio down and rounded up the others in the pump, the officer said.

 Girls on rampage

 Girls of a Bowbazar school ransacked a classroom today for being denied promotion.

 Police said 112 Class XI students out of 243 at CMO Girls HS School had failed. 

 They accused the school of seeking money to promote them and went berserk. Furniture were smashed and the school was locked up.

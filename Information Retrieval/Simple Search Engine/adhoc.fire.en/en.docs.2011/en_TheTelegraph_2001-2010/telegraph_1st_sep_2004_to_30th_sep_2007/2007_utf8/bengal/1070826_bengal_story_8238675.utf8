 Calcutta, Aug. 25: A young boy is taunted for coming to class in only his shorts. He cant afford a shirt. Ashamed, he never returns to school.

 Almost half-a-century later, he finds a wad of Rs 50 notes that a passenger has left behind on the seat of the rickshaw he now pulls.

 These two events prompted Swapan Adhikary, of Pollapara village in Pagligunj, to embark on a mission.

 I tried very hard to find out who had left it. I kept the money for two years but when no one came to claim it, I started thinking about what to do with it, says the 70-year-old, 15 years later. 

 The sole earning member of a family of four decided to buy books and clothes for the young, needy students of villages in a pocket of South Dinajpur.

 Ever since, Adhikary has kept up the tradition. Scraping together enough money from his meagre earnings not more than Rs 70 a day he buys books and clothes for students who need them.

 It is for this heroic effort that Adhikary was honoured by The Telegraph Education Foundation this morning at The Telegraph School Awards For Excellence, where he took the Science City stage to a standing ovation.

 Dadu to some, Kaku to others, the frail old man who cycles 12km from Pagligunj to the Balurghat rickshaw stand every morning to start his days work, puts his meagre collections away in a bank. At the end of a year, I take the money out and buy paper, books and pens and distribute them to those who are needy and deserving, explains Adhikary, who travelled to Calcutta for the first time this weekend.

 This father of two does more. He goes from school to school, para to para, to find out which children are not going to school and why. He checks their results and hands out study material to those who are bright but are unable to study because of lack of money. 

 He also organises health camps around Balurghat, Kumarganj and Hili blocks, for which he raises money by asking his passengers for an extra 50paise or 25paise.

 This is my mission, he says. I always feel I havent done anything yet. But one Swapan cant dream of achieving literacy for all children in the state. Not even a hundred Swapans can do it. Everyone needs to come forward if we want to drive illiteracy out.

 The Telegraph Education Foundation did its bit to help his cause today. Adhikary received an award of Rs 55,000, of which Rs 10,000 will help treat an injured shoulder, and the rest will be used over the next three years in the rickshaw-pullers quest to keep children in school.

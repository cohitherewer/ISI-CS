The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Scent of hawker hitters

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, March 24: Members of the gang that fatally assaulted hawker Raju Prasad near Gol Park on Wednesday are former students of a local college, police said today.

 A senior officer of Lake police station said the police have gathered some information about the man who led his three friends into kicking Raju in his chest and ribs on that night. His fault: he had dared to tick them off for drinking on a pavement near his house off Gol Park. 

 The gang then put the 26-year-old hawker under virtual house arrest, warning his family against taking him to hospital or going to the police.

 Yesterday morning, Rajus condition deteriorated and he was taken to Calcutta National Medical College, where he died.

 The police today said the group they had been batchmates in college would hang around Gol Park every day, and as night fell their sessions with the bottle would begin.

 We hope to round up the gang soon. There are a few witnesses and we will talk to them to find out what exactly led to the trouble, the officer said.

 Raju, who used to hawk hosiery near Gariahat, was an only son. His body was sent for post-mortem today. 

 Officers probing the case also collected the medical report from the Calcutta National Medical College. The report said Raju was brought dead, but his pupils were bulging out and there were no signs of external bleeding.

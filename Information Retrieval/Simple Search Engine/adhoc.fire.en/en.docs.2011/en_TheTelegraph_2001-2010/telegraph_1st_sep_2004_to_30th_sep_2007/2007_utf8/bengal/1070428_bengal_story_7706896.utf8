 Beach hotel scan

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 27: The high court today ordered a survey to find out whether eight hotels on the coast at Mandarmani were too close to the sea. 

 The committee appointed by the coastal regulatory zone authority will find out whether the hotels violate the coastal zone regulation act and take action accordingly within ten weeks, the division bench of Justices P.C. Ghosh and B. Somadder said.

 A public interest litigation filed by an NGO working on environment and public heath had contended that the hotels, about 30 km from Digha, would harm both marine life and fisher folks.

 Coastal zone rules do not allow any construction within 200 meters of the tide line fixed during the high tide in spring.

 The state pollution control board had asked four hotels to pull down their structures and threatened others with disconnection of water and power supplies.

 Oswal Viapaar Ltd, which owns a hotel at Mandarmani, 200 km from Calcutta, had challenged the legality of the notice. 

 The court stayed the notice, saying the board had no authority to order demolition. Only the coastal zone regulatory authority can determine whether the hotels were flouting the law and decide the penalty, it said.

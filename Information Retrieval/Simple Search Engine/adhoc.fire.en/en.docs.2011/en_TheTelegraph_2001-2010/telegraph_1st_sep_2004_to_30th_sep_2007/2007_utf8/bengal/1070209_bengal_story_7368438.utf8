 Ishwardaha, Feb. 8: Sadhucharan Chatterjee, 59, the sub-inspector of the district intelligence branch who was lynched by villagers in Ishwardaha yesterday, had a heart condition and did not want to accompany the police team from Bhabanipur which came under attack.

 His colleagues at Bhabanipur police station said it was a request from officer-in-charge Nirmal Majhi that made him sling a cloth bag across his shoulder and climb into the jeep that rolled towards Ishwardaha, 11 km away.

 Sadhu (as he was known among his colleagues) had requested for a posting at the district intelligence branch two years ago because of his heart condition. At the intelligence branch, Sadhu had a quieter job, said Rathin Bakshi, the officer-in-charge of Durgachak police station, where Sadhucharan was earlier posted. Sadhucharan had a year to go before retirement.

 After the two police jeeps stopped at Barasundara, the dozen policemen, along with Sadhucharan, began a two- kilometre trek to Uttar Pally of Ishwardaha, from where reports had come that villagers opposed to land acquisition were trying to dig up roads.

 In plainclothes, with a sweater hurriedly pulled over his tucked-in shirt, Sadhucharan followed the police team. By the time they reached Uttar Pally, he was panting for breath. 

 When the villagers attacked the policemen with sticks and rods, Sadhucharan was hit on the head and collapsed.

 At that time, the policemen were in a hurry to get out of the place. The OC and four others were profusely bleeding. Everyone was busy with himself and Sadhus absence was not noticed, said a police officer of Bhabanipur police station.

 After interrogating 22 arrested villagers, the police have come to know that in the melee, some villagers dragged an unconscious Sadhucharan by his feet into the village. 

 The way the villagers attacked the policemen and dragged Sadhucharan away reveals that some hardened criminals were involved, said Haldia sub-divisional police officer Swapan Sarkar.

 When the villagers realised that Sadhucharan was dead, they put the body in a gunny bag to hide him. They dragged the bag across a kilometre over a field of standing crop of kalai dal. 

 We corroborated the version of the arrested villagers. A stretch of the kalai dal crop was flattened as if something heavy had been dragged over it, Sarkar said.

 According to the police, the body was then put on a cycle van and carried for another kilometre to the Haldi where it was put on a boat and dumped into the river.

 The police have engaged divers and fishermen to find the body since this morning. A hovercraft has also been pressed into operation. But the body is yet to be traced.

 Purbasthali, April 23: At least 20 skulls and a heap of bones were scooped out in night-long raids across Burdwan district as police blew the lid off a racket in skeletons. 

 Six people, who were arrested from Katwa and Purbasthali, said the skulls and bones were sold to medical students.

 The government has asked the CID to handle the probe.

 We sniffed such a racket while inquiring into the alleged theft of bodies from burial grounds, said Burdwan superintendent of police Peeyush Pandey.

 Narayan Bairagya, Ashok Das, and Bhola Das were held at Keshia village in Katwa. They tipped off the police on their kingpins Purbasthali hideout. Mukti Biswas, 55, the alleged gang lord, and Tarun Biswas and Samaresh Chowdhury were arrested from Purbasthali, 170 km from Calcutta. 

 The skulls and bones were packed in jute bags and hidden underground in the houses where the arrests were made. The police said they have confessed to their crime.

 Biswas told the police that there are at least 20 others in Bengal, Orissa and Bangladesh, running the racket for over 40 years. 

 He named two of his associates Mewalal Mullick in Calcutta and Bittu Mohanti in Bhubaneswar.

 The police detained Mukti Biswas several times earlier but released him because of lack of evidence. His associates steal bodies from burial grounds and burning ghats. Weve located the place on the bank of the Bhagirathi where the bodies were immersed in a mixture of caustic soda and acid to separate the flesh from the bones, Pandey said.

 A skeleton fetches between Rs 1,200 and Rs 5,000. 

 In an interview to The Telegraph in February 2006, Biswas had said: Im doing nothing wrong. The poor cannot cremate their dead because they dont have money. Either they bury the bodies or throw them in the river. Sometimes half-burnt bodies are abandoned on the ghats. We pick them up. There is a big demand for skeletons among medical students. Weve sent skeletons even to Bangladesh.

 HC order on support to wife

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 1: The high court today ruled that a separated wife had no claim to maintenance from her husband if she had not been neglected or ill-treated by him. The court also held that if a husband wanted his wife to stay with him, she was bound to do so provided he did not torture or misbehave with her.

 The high court upheld an order of a Krishnagar court asking Jumka Chakraborty to stay with her husband Trilochan Chakraborty at his home in Nadias Nabadwip. It also set aside an Alipore courts verdict directing him to pay Rs 1,000 a month as maintenance.

 The court in Krishnagar had passed an order directing Jumka to stay with her husband but she had not obeyed the order.

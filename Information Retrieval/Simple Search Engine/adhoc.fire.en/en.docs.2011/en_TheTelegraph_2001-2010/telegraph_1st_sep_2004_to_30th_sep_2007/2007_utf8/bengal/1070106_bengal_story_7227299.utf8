The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 HC asks for govt blueprint

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

Calcutta, Jan. 5: The high court today told the government to produce before it all details regarding its land acquisition plans and Singur, where a plot has already been fenced off for a Tata Motors factory.

 The court order followed a petition by a Calcutta resident, R.N. Yadav, who claimed that the procedure followed by the government to allow new industries on agricultural land was not in accordance with law and, therefore, invalid.

 Appearing for the petitioner, advocate S.R. Das told the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Mitra that the state had no master plan for industrialisation. 

 Advocate-general Balai Ray, however, said the government has a Singur master plan and can produce all documents on land acquisition there.

 Five separate cases have been moved in the high court (picture above) over Singur. All of them are pending.

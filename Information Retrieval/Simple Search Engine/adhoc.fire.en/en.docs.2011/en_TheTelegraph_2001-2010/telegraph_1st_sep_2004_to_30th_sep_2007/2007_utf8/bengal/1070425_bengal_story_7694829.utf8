 Purbasthali, April 24: The skeleton racket kingpin held yesterday was apparently released from custody on several occasions earlier because of his political links. 

 Mukti Biswas, 55, the Class VII dropout dom who handles corpses in burning ghats and morgues was a Trinamul Congress candidate in the 1998 panchayat polls. Residents of Purbasthali, who have known him for long, said he had an equally good rapport with the CPM. 

 Twenty-one skulls and a heap of bones have been found in raids across Burdwan since Sunday night. 

 The police said Biswas has been in the trade since he was 15 and his network went beyond Bengal up to Orissa and Bangladesh, he has apparently confessed.

 The stink of bodies that he used to bring to what the police said were his factories to flesh out the skeletons had made life hell for the residents.

 The entire locality stinks when the bodies are left to decompose. We find it difficult to breathe, said Panchanan Pal of Patuli, a village about 15 km from Biswass house at Stationpara.

 Frequent complaints to the administration pointing out the goings-on had allegedly failed to produce a result. Mukti and his henchmen used to threaten us if we warned them against continuing with the trade, Pal added. 

 The police admitted that decomposed bodies were immersed in a mix of caustic soda and acid to separate the flesh from the bones but denied having received complaints against Biswas. 

 We never got any specific complaint or strong evidence against him. We started keeping a watch on him after receiving a number of complaints of theft from burial grounds, said Peeyush Pandey, the Burdwan superintendent of police. 

 Residents of Stationpara claimed that Biswass younger son Manoj had committed suicide at the age of 19 after his father refused to stop his trade. Manoj had learnt about his fathers business and opposed it, said Badal Mondal, a neighbour. 

 Biswass wife Deepali died 15 years ago. His eldest son Gopal, 28, a CPM supporter, allegedly helps his father in the trade. 

 Pandey, however, said there was not enough evidence against him.

 A local leader, Tapan Chatterjee, said Biswas is now a CPM supporter.

 Purbasthalis CPM legislator Subrata Bhawal said: Muktis skeleton trade is an open secret. The police and all political parties were aware of it. 

 He added that neither me nor my party ever encouraged his business. 

 A CID team led by special superintendent Nabarun Bhattacharya arrived here last night. 

 Biswas and his associates have been remanded in police custody. 

 They have been charged with stealing bodies, which is a bailable offence, senior public prosecutor Tapas Banerjee said.

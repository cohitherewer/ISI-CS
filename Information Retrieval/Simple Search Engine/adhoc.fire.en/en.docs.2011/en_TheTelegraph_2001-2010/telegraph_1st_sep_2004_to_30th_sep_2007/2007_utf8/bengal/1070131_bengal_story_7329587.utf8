The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CPM dusts land sop of the seventies

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Abdur Rezzak Mollah

Calcutta, Jan. 30: The chief minister will bestow the right to cultivate government plots on landless peasants in Nandigram and neighbouring areas to win over those opposed to land acquisition. 

 We are planning to ensure the chief ministers presence in a programme to distribute pattas (land deeds) in East Midnapore and some other districts, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said today. 

 The government has planned to distribute pattas for 30,000 acres by Poila Baisakh, the Bengali New Year. 

 The government owns around 80,000 acres of vested land across the state, Mollah said. 

 Distribution of land among landless farmers had been the key feature of first two terms of the Left Front government. It helped the front consolidate its rural base and hold on to power since 1977. 

 The party seems to have geared up again to refurbish its pro-farmer image in the wake of the row over acquisition of agricultural land for industry and infrastructure projects. 

 Mollah, however, added that no policy has been framed to give vested land to those rendered landless because of acquisition. No such decision has been taken. Neither are we thinking on those lines. No excess land above the land ceiling is available for the government to take over and redistribute it.

 The government has planned to acquire around 70,000 acres across Bengal for a string of projects. The land ceiling law is set to be relaxed to allow large holdings by private companies for industrial or commercial activities. 

 The Land Reforms (Amendment) Bill, 2006, now being examined by the Assemblys select committee, has proposed to empower the government to relax the ceiling and acquire and lease out the excess land to investors. Mollah is the chairman of the committee.

 The bill also allows acquisition of tribal land and makes room for sale of land tilled by sharecroppers by making them part-owners of the land. 

 In what was described as a safety valve by land officials, the companies would have to submit the detailed project report before obtaining approval for holding land above the ceiling. Preference in exemption would be given only to industries and select commercial activities, including agri-industry and business. 

 The bill proposes to regularise all land-use conversion since August 7, 1969, but Mollah wants the cut-off to be 1981. 

 The select committee will meet on February 6. All parties have been asked to submit their amendment proposals by tomorrow.

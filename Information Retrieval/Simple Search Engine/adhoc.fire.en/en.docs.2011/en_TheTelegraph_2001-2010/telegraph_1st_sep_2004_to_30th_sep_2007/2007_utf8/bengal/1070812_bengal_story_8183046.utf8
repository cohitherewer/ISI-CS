 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Aug. 11: The Citu-affiliated Calcutta Car Pool Owners Association will hold a meeting tomorrow, urging car pool owners and drivers to register with it.

 We have a set of guidelines for those registered with us and we monitor these drivers regularly. But those not registered dont follow any norms and drive recklessly. Whenever there is an accident, we lose business because of them, association secretary Shantanu Saha said.

 Calcutta: Opposition leader Partha Chatterjee has said that the Trinamul Congress would never allow the small-car project on farmland in Singur, a day after Ratan Tata said efforts were on to meet the deadline.

 Calcutta: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee went for an eye check-up at the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology on Saturday. A doctor said tests to ascertain the blood pressure in his eyes and the state of the corneas were satisfactory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Road-dig democracy

 JULIUS GOMES

 Nandigram, Feb. 4: Mamata Banerjee today supported digging up roads and putting up blockades in the land war. 

 We must congratulate the farmers efforts to keep the police out of the area for it is their democratic right, she said at the Sitanan- da College ground here, about 175 km from Calcutta.

 If the CPM government can use the law to curb the rights of common people, the farmers of Nandigram and Singur have a democratic right to dig up roads to keep the police out, the Trinamul Congress chief said.

 Some villagers had dug up a road in neighbouring Khejuri at four places on the eve of Mamatas visit. Trenches in over 30 places in Nandigram have left the region paralysed and its economy on the verge of collapse.

 However, Mamatas party was in a spot yesterday after being pressured to shift the rally to the fringes of Nandigram by the Jamait Ulema-i-Hind, which has been spearheading the anti-acquisition protests here. Jamait leaders did not want Mamata to reap political harvest by addressing a meeting in its stronghold. 

 Anticipating trouble, more than 250 policemen were present near the college ground since morning but they had to retreat in the face of Trinamul protests.

 The force was later deployed along the road linking Nandigram with Khejuri, where Trinamul supporters had clashed with their CPM rivals last evening.

 Mamata arrived here around 2.30 pm.

 Moments before that, Trinamul leader Subhendu Adhikary proudly announced over the loudspeaker that violence had rocked Singur. 

 Mamata accused the CPM and the police of targeting innocent peasants who did not have the means to defend themselves and protect the land that provides them their bread.

 She also called all anti-CPM forces to come together to fight the CPM. 

 Jamait secretary Siddiqullah Chowdhury had asked Mamata a few days ago to quit the BJP-led NDA and lead the anti-acquisition fight. The Trinamul chief did not respond.

 We must unite to make sure that the atrocities let loose by the police and CPM cadres stop, she said today.

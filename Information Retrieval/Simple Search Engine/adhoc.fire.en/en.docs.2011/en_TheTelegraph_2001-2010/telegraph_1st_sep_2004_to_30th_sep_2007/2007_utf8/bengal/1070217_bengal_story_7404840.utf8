 BDO jailed for flouting court order

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 16: The high court today jailed Islampur block development officer Tarak Mallick for a week and fined him Rs 5,000 for defying an earlier order.

 Mallick had been told to appoint Gopi Krishna Banerjee secretary of a village pancha-yat in North Dinajpur. He did not.

 Justice A. Banerjee today also fined Madhusudan Roy, a former block development officer (BDO), Rs 1,020 for a similar offence. 

 Gopi Krishnas was the second name on a panel for village panchayat secretary in January 2006. Hasim Mollah, another resident of Islampur, was top of the list.

 But Gopi Krishna wrote to then BDO Roy last September demanding the job as Mollah had been convicted in a criminal case and was facing trial in another. 

 Mollah had suppressed the information to obtain an order from the high court for his appointment. 

 Mallick, who replaced Roy after he was transferred to Bankura as the additional magistrate, appointed Mollah on the basis of this order. 

 When Gopi Krishna moved court, it ordered Mallick to terminate Mollahs service and replace him with Gopi Krishna. But Mallick did not obey the order.

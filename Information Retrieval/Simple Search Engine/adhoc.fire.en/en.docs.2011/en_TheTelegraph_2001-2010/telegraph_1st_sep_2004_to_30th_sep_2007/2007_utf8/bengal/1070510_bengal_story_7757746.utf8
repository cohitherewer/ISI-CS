The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Drug for bat virus combat

 RABI BANERJEE

 Krishnagar, May 9: An anti-viral drug Ribavarin which was widely used in Malaysia when Nipah struck there in 1999 is being used in Nadia to treat the suspected cases.

 Health officials here said Ribavarin, a tablet of which costs around Rs 75, will be given to the 30 patients down with fever at Betai village and in Krishnagar. 

 Their blood samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, for confirmatory tests. 

 Of the 30 patients, 20 are from Betai, close to the Bangladesh border, about 150 km from Calcutta.

 Nadia chief medical officer Mrinal Kanti Biswas said the decision to procure Ribavarin was taken following advice from experts at the Pune institute. 

 We are buying the drug from Hyderabad and will distribute it free to those who show symptoms of the affliction or run temperature for days, said Biswas.

 A three-member medical board has been set up to monitor fever cases being reported to hospitals and health centres in the district. Suspected patients will be kept under observation in isolation wards. 

 Besides a district hospital in Krishnagar, Nadia has four subdivisional hospitals and seven block hospitals.

 Nipah has no cure, but Ribavarin would alleviate the symptoms of nausea, vomiting and convulsion, said doctors. 

 The virus, which has claimed three lives in the district and afflicted many, could have come from Bangladesh.

 Tapas Majumder, the first victim from Betai, had been to the neighbouring country on a business trip in February. 

 He was running a temperature within days of his return, district magistrate .S. Meena said.

 The virus, first detected in Malaysia in 1999, has since been known to strike only two other places, Bangladesh and Bengal. 

 It killed 105 of the 265 patients in Malaysia, 18 of 30 in Bangladesh in April 2004, and three-fourths of the 66 it infected in Siliguri in 2001.

 The drug, Ribavarin, was also used on SARS patients in China, said a doctor who is part of the three-member board. 

 The drug is primarily used because it reduces nausea, vomiting and convulsion and brings back appetite. These symptoms are common in Nipah patients.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Backward woes study

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 24: The government has ordered a survey on the socio-economic condition of 44 lakh backward class people in a dozen districts.

 The move follows the infiltration of Maoist guerrillas in districts with a larger concentration of backward people. 

 They are trying to woo tribals by campaigning against the government. The survey will help us improve their living conditions, backward classes welfare minister Jogesh Burman said.

 The state-run Cultural Research Institute will conduct the study with anthropologists from Calcutta and North Bengal universities. It will be completed in 12 months starting October, Burman said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Party boss calls Biman

 Calcutta, May 3: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat summoned his Bengal counterpart to Delhi today. 

 Biman Bose, who flew to the capital this morning, remained tight-lipped on his return in the evening. 

 Karat earlier said the party should learn from its mistakes in Nandigram and asked the Bengal unit to review its follies in handling the situation there. 

 A Congress-Trinamul Congress team led by Mamata Banerjee met governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi today and demanded that Khejuri, a CPM str-onghold, be declared a disturbed area and the paramilitary be deployed there.

 Bose said: She should ask herself who are responsible for the violence in Nandigram, instead of making such demands. Her party leaders should be told to attend all-party meetings.

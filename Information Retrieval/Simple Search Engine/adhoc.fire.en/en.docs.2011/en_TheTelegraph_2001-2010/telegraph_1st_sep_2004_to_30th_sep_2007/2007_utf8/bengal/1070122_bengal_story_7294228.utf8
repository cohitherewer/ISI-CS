The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Speaker feels Subhas will not contest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 21: Veteran CPM leader Somnath Chatterjee, whom Subhas Chakraborty called up today, got the impression that he will not contest the Cricket Association of Bengal election.

 Chakraborty had yesterday insisted that he would contest the election despite the party saying no to him. 

 Subhas telephoned me this morning to discuss his candidature for the CAB poll among other things. I will not elaborate on what we discussed. But as far as my impression goes, he will not contest. After all, nobody is above the party, the Lok Sabha Speaker said tonight. 

 The minister had a meeting with state CPM secretary Biman Bose last night.

 Asked about its outcome, he flared up today. Why should I tell you? I will say what I have to say on January 24. 

 January 24 is the last date for filing nomination for CAB president. 

 Although Chakraborty remained tight-lipped, sources close to him said Bose warned him against contesting the election. The party brass had on Friday issued a statement saying Chakraborty has been asked not to contest. 

 One of Chakrabortys aides had yesterday said that he would contest, come what may. Another aide today said: Subhasda would do nothing risking party action. 

 He wanted to contest to pressure city police chief Prasun Mukherjee to pull out of the CAB poll. But that does not mean that he will invite disciplinary action from the party with which he has been associated for a long time.

 Detractors said the sports minister is backtracking in the face of a veiled threat of disciplinary action. He is looking for a facesaver to come out of the imbroglio. 

 Two ministers the RSPs Kshiti Goswami and the CPIs Nandagopal Bhattacharya had also pledged support for Chakrabortys candidature. 

 Samar Paul, an associate of Mukherjee, today moved the city civil court seeking the appointment of an observer to conduct the CAB general body meeting and the election on February 1. 

 Pal also accused CAB general secretary Saradindu Pal and Jagmohan Dalmiya of trying to influence voters of other clubs. The case will come up for hearing tomorrow.

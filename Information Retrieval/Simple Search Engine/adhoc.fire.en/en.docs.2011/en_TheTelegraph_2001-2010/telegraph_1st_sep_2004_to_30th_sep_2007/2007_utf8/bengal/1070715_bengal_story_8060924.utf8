The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Heavy rain ahead

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 14: Rain clouds are heading back to Calcutta and some parts of south Bengal.

 The Met office today predicted heavy rain during the next two days. But it added that the onslaught would not be as fierce as that on July 3 and 4.

 The director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore, G.C. Debnath, said a low pressure that had formed over the north-west Bay of Bengal and adjoining areas of coastal Orissa yesterday had intensified into a well-marked low pressure today.

 It is moving towards the Bengal-Orissa border and under its influence, heavy rain is expected in Gangetic Bengal during the next 48 hours, Debnath said.

 We dont expect the atmospheric system to intensify any further before hitting land. So, we dont expect the rain to exceed the 120mm mark. 

 He added that a heavier downpour is expected in Orissa.

 The torrent earlier this month had flooded Calcutta and some south Bengal districts, claiming more than 50 lives. The rain damaged crops and had almost all major rivers in East and West Midnapore overflowing. Floodwaters are yet to recede from the two districts.

 The rain had been caused by a low pressure that developed into a depression within two days. The depression had entered Bangladesh and crossed over to North 24-Parganas.

 But the present low pressure is unlikely to intensify into a depression, a Met official said.

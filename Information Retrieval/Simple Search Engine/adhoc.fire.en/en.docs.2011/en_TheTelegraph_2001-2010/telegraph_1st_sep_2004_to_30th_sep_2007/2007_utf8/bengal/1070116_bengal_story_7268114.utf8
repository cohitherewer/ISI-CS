 Army rethink

 Jan. 15: Army officers at the Trishakti Corps headquarters in Sukna, near Siliguri, today said they had no plans to use farmland in Raiganj (North Dinajpur) or in its vicinity for a military exercise in the near future.

 An army team had gone to Itahar yesterday with the objective of occupying around 400 acres of fertile land for a month-long training. 

 Following farmers protests, Brigadier P.S. Chib today said only fallow land would be used temporarily to carry out the exercise.

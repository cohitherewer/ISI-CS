 Ray wants CM in dock

 Calcutta, July 23: Former chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray today demanded in the high court that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee be called to the witness box to clarify why he gave land to Tata Motors without taking a paisa. 

 There is an allegation that the chief minister had awarded the land to Tata, a company having over 20 per cent foreign share, without taking a paisa. The chief minister has kept mum on the matter. So, either he or his industries minister (Nirupam Sen) should be called to the witness box to clarify their stand, Ray said, appearing for a petitioner in the Singur land acquisition case. 

 The court will decide whom to call to the dock only after hearing all the arguments, which could take days.

 Singur probe: The CBI questioned Saila Sahana, Bhanu Hambir and Krishna Barik in the Tapasi Malik murder case. Sahana supplied building materials for the Tata project. Barik works in a canteen on the site and Hambir is an electrician.

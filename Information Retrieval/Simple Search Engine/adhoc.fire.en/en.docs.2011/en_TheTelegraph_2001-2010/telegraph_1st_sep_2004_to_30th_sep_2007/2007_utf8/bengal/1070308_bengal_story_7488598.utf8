 BRIEFS

 Balurghat, March 7: Eight BSF jawans accused of beating a teenager to death have been suspended. 

 They have been taken off duty and will have to go without salary till the inquiry is complete, South Dinajpur district magistrate Sayeed Sar- faraz Ahmed said.

 Masud Rana Sarkar, a resident of Daudpur, his parents and sister were beaten up by the drunk jawans who apparently came to settle a water dispute in a neighbouring village. 

 Tamluk: There was violence in Nandigram again. Police had to fire in the air to scare away Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee supporters who attacked two CPM leaders. Panchayat samiti chief Ashok Bera and Uttam Bera, a panchayat member, were attacked at Maheshpur on their way to Nandigram. Some policemen were injured when the mob hurled bombs.

 Midnapore: Tortured for not being able to give birth to a boy, Akima Biwi, 30, committed suicide after throttling to death her four-year-old daughter Tasima. The resident of Sutahata in East Midnapore, 120 km from Calcutta, had also apparently tried to kill her other daughter, but she fled. Police said her husband Sheikh Ismail was preparing to marry again for a son. Akima protested, but was subject-ed to more torture.

 Behrampore: Five passengers were injured when they jumped out of a running train in the Katwa-Azimgunj section. They saw smoke and thought the engine had caught fire.

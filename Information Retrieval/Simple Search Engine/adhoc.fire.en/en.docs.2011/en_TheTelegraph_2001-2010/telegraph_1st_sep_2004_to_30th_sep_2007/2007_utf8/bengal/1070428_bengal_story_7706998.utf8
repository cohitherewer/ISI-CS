 Calcutta/Midnapore, April 27: Fresh violence erupted in Nandigram today and Mamata Banerjee ruled out talks with the administration till peace was restored.

 Ironically, her own supporters were accused of attacking local CPI legislator Mohammad Ilias and ransacking his house.

 Supporters of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee surrounded Ilias at Chowringhee Bazar when he went to attend a rally and slapped and punched him. 

 Bombs were hurled and shots fired in six areas in Nandigram and Khejuri.

 In Calcutta, Mamata criticised Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for the violence. 

 The chief minister had on Tuesday appealed to the Opposition to help bring peace to the region and attend an all-party meeting called by the administration.

 How can the chief minister talk about an all-party meeting when he has failed to contain the violence? Its ridiculous. CPM cadres are hurling bombs in Sonachura and the law and order has got worse. Buddhababu is doing nothing to prevent the trouble, Mamata said. 

 She also did not spare Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The Prime Minister cant behave like a deaf-mute person as people belonging to the minority community and Scheduled Castes and tribes are being attacked and killed. 

 Does he want the rape victims of Nandigram to demonstrate outside his residence? Mamata asked.

 Reacting to the state Congresss demand that the governor call an all-party meeting, former chief minister Jyoti Basu said: The governor is not supposed to be involved in such controversies.

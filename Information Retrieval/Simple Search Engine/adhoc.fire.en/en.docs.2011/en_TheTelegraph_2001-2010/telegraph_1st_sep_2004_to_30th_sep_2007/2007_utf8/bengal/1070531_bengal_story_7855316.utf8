 Jindals eye 2011 start

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 30: Phase I of the Rs 35,000-crore Jindal steel plant would be running by the middle of 2011.

 Construction for the initial capacity of 3 million tonnes in Salboni, West Midnapore, is expected to start by the end of this year.

 JSW Steel chief Sajjan Jindal will meet Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee tomorrow to apprise him of the companys eagerness to get on with the job and keep the deadline set internally.

 However, the company has to first settle the price at which it is to buy its land. The issue will come up for discussion tomorrow.

 The government had issued an offer letter earlier this month to lease out 4,200 acres at an average price of Rs 1.9 lakh an acre.

 It is learnt that the Jindals are seeking a lower rate. However, the company is unlikely to stretch the negotiation too far. Land price will not be a deal breaker for sure, sources close to the negotiation said.

 The government and JSW Steel signed a pact on January 11 to set up the plant, which would have a 10 million-tonne capacity. A 600-mw power plant will be part of the project but the company has also proposed an independent 1,000-mw unit.

 The projects progress will, however, depend on some other critical issues such as water resource and coal and iron ore linkages.

 An environment ministry approval is expected by September. Construction can only begin after that.

 The Jindals have gone ahead with the project without captive mines. They plan to buy iron ore dust, called fines, from private owners.

 The company has to put a watertight legal framework to secure the raw material for a long period. Work is on, a source said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, April 22: A man named Bijoy Kishen was arrested for allegedly impersonating a Bengal JEE candidate from Bihar, Niranjan Kumar, during todays Biology examination.

 Niranjan, too, was picked up from a Howrah hotel where he went to meet Kishen this evening. Jorasanko police officers said Kishen was writing the paper at Calcutta Universitys Ashutosh Hall, when invigilators noticed that the photograph on the admit card was not his.

 Krishnagar: Bangladesh Riffles personnel shot at BSF jawans on Sunday after the Indians apparently fired to prevent smugglers from sneaking in near the Matiary outpost in Nadia. Moyna Mondal, 40, an alleged smuggler, was killed. The BDR fired 12 rounds to prevent us from taking possession of the body, said R.K. Hajela, a BSF DIG. 

 Chinsurah: A Nadia couple was robbed of their suitcase on the Howrah-bound Bagh Express near Barauni in Bihar. Santanu Kundu of Nakashipa- ra lodged a complaint at Bandel on realising that he had been robbed. The miscreants must have mad them unconscious, he said. 

 Midnapore: The Op-position again boycotted a peace meeting in Nandigram. The Congress and the SUCI had said they would not attend the meeting called by the East Midnapore intelligence branch because the March 14 police firing was not on its agenda. Trinamul and the Jamait Ulema-i-Hind said at the last moment that they would also not be part of it. Midnapore range DIG N. Ramesh Babu chaired a meeting with the Left partners.

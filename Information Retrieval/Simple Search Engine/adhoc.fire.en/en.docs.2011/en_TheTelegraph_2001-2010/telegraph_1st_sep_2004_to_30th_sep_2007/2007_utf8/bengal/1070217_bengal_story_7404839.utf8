The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata in Singur today

 Calcutta, Feb. 16: Mamata Banerjee is returning to Singur tomorrow with the demand that work on the Tata project be stopped and the forcibly acquired land given back.

 My demands remain the same, she said tonight.

 While the government has said only around 30 acres out of the 997-odd were acquired without the owners consent, Mamata has been insisting that over 450 acres were forcibly taken away.

 Mamata will address a rally near Kamarkundu station, 5 km from the Tata Motors plot and 50 km from Calcutta. 

 It would be the first Opposition rally in Singur in over two months. Mamata was stopped on her way on November 30 because Section 144 was in force there. Trinamul Congress MLAs vandalised the Assembly in protest. 

 The order was in force for 60 days from November 30 and was extended twice till the midnight of February 14. 

 The chief minister, the industries minister, their departmental secretaries, the chief secretary and the home secretary reviewed the Singur situation today.

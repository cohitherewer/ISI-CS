The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: The national human rights commission has issued a notice to the Bengal government on The Telegraph report on how a girl with boyish ways was paraded nude in a Nadia village. 

 Taking suo motu cognisance of the December 25 report, the commission has asked the state chief secretary and police chief to send a report within four weeks. 

 The 19-year-old was tonsured, stripped, paraded, tied to a post and thrashed at Garapota village in Hanskhali, 70 km from Calcutta, because she had refused to snap ties with her best friend, whose in-laws did not like her ways.

 Calcutta: Social acti-vist Medha Patkar was held here on her way to Singur. She was placed under arrest in a house off EM Bypass and later shifted to a Salt Lake youth hostel. The home secretary said she could not be allowed to enter Singur with supporters because of prohibitory orders there.

 Krishnagar: Police are looking for a schoolteacher who allegedly sold off books meant for free distribution. The teacher of Jugpur Primary School in Nakashipara, about 130 km from Calcutta, is suspected to have stolen the books.

 Nabadwip: Relatives of a two-year-old girl who died in a hospital here on Wednesday beat up the doctor accusing him of negligence. Jayati Ghosh was admitted in the morning with high fever.

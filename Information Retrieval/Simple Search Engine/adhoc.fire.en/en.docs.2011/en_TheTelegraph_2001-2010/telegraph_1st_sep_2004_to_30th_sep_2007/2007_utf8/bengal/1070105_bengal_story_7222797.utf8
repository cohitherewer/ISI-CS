 Tata picks Singur XI

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 4: Happy but circumspect that sums up the mood of the first batch of youngsters from Singur selected by Tata Motors for on-the-job training at its plants in Jamshedpur and Pune.

 I am happy. But I will decide only after talking to my parents and other people. If it (the offer) is genuine, I will go, said Somen Roy, one of the 11 whose name was posted at the camp office of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation in Singur late this afternoon.

 Roy and the rest represent families who have given up land for the Tata Motors small-car factory in Singur.

 Roy was born and brought up in Gopalpur, one of the four mouzas covering the 997 acres acquired for the Tatas.

 His father works in a Birla-run engineering factory in Calcutta and they used to get their Singur land tilled by sharecroppers.

 Like the 10 others in his group, Roy has attended the government-run Industrial Training Institute courses.

 They have been selected out of 21 candidates who appeared for a written test and an interview held on December 25 in Singur. 

 The six-month training to be provided by the company will cover various disciplines. Tata Motors will also provide the youths hostel facilities and pay them a monthly stipend. 

 Once the programme is over, they will be eligible for employment in the Singur factory. 

 With the first small car expected to roll out only in 2008, the youths are hoping that till then, the training would equip them to get jobs elsewhere. 

 Even if I do not get a job in this plant, I may get something in some other company after the training, said Purna Chandra Das, who was selected today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cry for action in CPM

 - Leaders see lack of development behind flare-up

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Calcutta, Jan. 29: CPM ministers and party leaders from the minority community want the government to formulate a comprehensive development plan and not hurry into a knee-jerk reaction following the protests against land acquisition in Nandigram led by the Jamait Ulema-i-Hind. 

 We have committed mistakes in Nandigram. So there is no harm in talking to Jamait along with the others. It is not true that all Muslims in Bengal have joined the Jamait. But we have to instil the faith in the community that they have not been left out of our march to development, said MP and CPM central committee member Mohammad Salim. 

 Many CPM supporters have taken part in Jamait rallies in Nandigram over the past few months. 

 Land is an emotive issue and the Jamait is exploiting it, said a CPM minister from North 24-Parganas. But let us face facts the Jamait had been gaining ground by cashing in on the discontent among Muslims over jobs and other opportunities long before the land war broke. We know Bimanda (Bose, the state party secretary) and others are disturbed. But it is time for the leadership to act, he added. 

 The partys state secretariat has a lone minority member the ageing labour leader, Mohammad Amin. 

 Its high time we came out with an all-round development plan for Muslims, who comprise 28 per cent of the states population, rather than launch a Jamait-centric damage-control mission. The (Justice) Sachar committee report has revealed that Muslims are in a sorry state even in Left-ruled Bengal, a central committee member said. 

 Muslims get 2 per cent of government jobs in the state. It is difficult to explain why no state PSU chief or vice-chancellor is a Muslim, he added. 

 The chief minister had admitted the governments poor record in minority development and sought national and state plans for the community.

 The central leadership has set up a minority affairs cell led by general secretary Prakash Karat and is fine-tuning a national charter of demands on jobs, education and oth-er aspects of development.

 Most Muslim leaders in the party feel the talks offer to Jamait chief Siddiqullah Chowdhury after the outfit demonstrated its clout in Nandigram was a knee-jerk reaction. 

 We were not consulted before Subhasda (Chakraborty, transport minister) spoke to him. We are yet to know the chief ministers mind, said one of his cabinet colleagues.

 The Jamait was not called to the chief ministers meeting with minority leaders immediately after the Nandigram flare-up three weeks ago. Separate talks will only help Jamait increase its clout, a central committee leader warned.

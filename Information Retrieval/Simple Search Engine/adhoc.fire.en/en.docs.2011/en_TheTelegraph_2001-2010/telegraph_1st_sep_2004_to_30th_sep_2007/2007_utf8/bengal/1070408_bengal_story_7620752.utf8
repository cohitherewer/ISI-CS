 Calcutta, April 7: The Jadavpur University Teachers Association today appealed to students, teachers and others associated with the university to join its endeavour to restore peace and normality on the campus even as the three organisations that won the student union elections called a meeting to discuss their plan of action.

 The Faculty of Arts Students (FAS), the Democratic Students Front (DSF) of the engineering faculty and We The Independents (WTI) of the science faculty have won the student union polls.

 The students condemned Thursday nights violence on the campus and said none of them was responsible.

 Sourish Ghosh, general secretary of the Arts Faculty Students Union and a member of FAS, said: The coming week will be the last in this semester and all departments have scheduled exams which count in our final results. So the SFIs call to boycott classes is illogical.

 The university must ensure safety of all students who want to attend classes on Monday, said Amit Chakraborty, general secretary of Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union and DSF member.

 The teachers association denied involvement of two professors named in an FIR lodged on Thursday and stated in a letter to the vice-chancellor that allegations against them were false.

 In a separate incident, CPM supporters clashed with members of the Association for Peoples Democratic Rights (APDR) on Raja S.C. Mallick Road around 8.15 pm. The APDR had a taken out a rally against the Nandigram firing and its members were raising slogans against the SFIs role on the university campus.

 Presidency rampage

 Students allegedly owing allegiance to the SFI ransacked the union room of the Presidency College today, damaging furniture and documents.

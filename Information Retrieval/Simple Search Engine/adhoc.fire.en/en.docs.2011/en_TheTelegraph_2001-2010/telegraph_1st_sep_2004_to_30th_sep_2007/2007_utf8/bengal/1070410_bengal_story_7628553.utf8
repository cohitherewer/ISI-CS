 Mishap blame on narrow road

 Krishnagar, April 9: The foreign ministers car had to be hit by a lorry for the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government to realise that a long stretch of a national highway was too narrow with only two lanes.

 The 40 km stretch of NH 34 between Krishnagar and Plassey has been reduced to 20 feet by encroachments. Such a narrow stretch is unfit for a national highway, additional director-general of police, traffic, Utpal Dutta, said today.

 A lorry lost control and hit Pranab Mukherjees car after one of its tyres burst at Bethuadahari, 130 km from Calcutta, on Saturday night.

 Pranabbabu met with the accident simply because the road is very narrow, said Dutta, who visited the mishap site this afternoon for a probe.

 Intelligence branch addi- tional director-general Dilip Mitra and inspector-general, security, A.K. Maliwal arrived tonight to see if there was a security lapse. 

 Nakashipara circle inspector Pannalal Bhattacharya said at least 15 accidents occur on this stretch every month. Five to six people are killed. 

 Dutta said the lorry did not overturn on Mukherjees car. The ministers driver, who was travelling fast, could not apply the brakes on time and hit the lorry as it swerved after the tyre burst.

 The accident, he felt, could have been averted if a moderate speed was maintained on such a narrow stretch. 

 Aparesh Chowdhury, a National Highway Authority of India executive engineer, accused the government of not clearing the encroachments. Weve begun widening two-lane highways. But the work is not progressing well in Bengal because of the lack of government support, he said. 

 Chowdhury alleged that the contractor engaged to widen the road was threatened with a Nandigram-like agitation by the encroachers. A survey team returned to Delhi last month without completing the job, he said.

 The governor went to SSKM Hospital today to see Congress leader Manas Bhuniya, who was with Mukherjee during the crash.

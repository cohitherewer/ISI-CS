The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Rain forecast for city

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, Sept. 22: The Met office today warned that Calcutta and south Bengal would receive heavy rain in the next 24 hours. 

 A low pressure that formed over west-central Bay of Bengal three days ago intensified into a depression last night. It has travelled north, towards the Orissa coast. 

 This evening, the depression lay off Orissa with its centre close to Puri. It is likely to cross the coast in the early hours of Sunday. 

 Under its influence, all districts of Gangetic West Bengal are expected to receive fairly widespread rainfall, heavy in some areas, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore. 

 He said the rain is likely to grow more intense over the coasts, including East and West Midnapore and North and South 24-Parganas. 

 Fishermen have been advised not to venture into the high seas.

 Today, the city woke up to an overcast sky and gusty winds. There was not much rain, however, with Alipore recording 8.7mm till 5.30pm. The wind speed sometimes touched 50-55km an hour, a Met official said. 

 From the nature of the depression, we feel that Calcutta should also get fairly widespread rain on Sunday, the official said.

 However, once the depression hits land, it is likely to weaken gradually. The farther it enters the land the weaker it is expected to become.

 Heavy rain was reported from Digha.

 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, Jan. 3: Subrata Chakraborty, 30, who ran a lottery ticket stall at Silinda village in Nadias Chakdah, was beaten to death last night. 

 Police said the villagers hit Subrata with iron rods and bamboo sticks suspecting him to be involved in a string of thefts that took place in the locality, about 70 km from Calcutta, over the past three months. No one was arrested in connection with the thefts. No arrests have been made for the lynching either.

 Durgapur: A polythene bag with 35 detonators and 30 gelatine sticks was found at the Asansol city bus terminus on Wednesday morning. The bag had been left abandoned at the busy bus stand. Transport workers spotted the bag kept next to a Citu camp and called police around 6 am. The police suspect that the explosives were stolen from Eastern Coalfields Ltd mines.

 Calcutta: Author-activist Mahasweta Devi addressed a rally near Baruipur in South 24-Parganas, about 30 km from Calcutta, under the banner of the Trinamul Congress-backed Save Farmland Committee. She urged the government to come clean on land acquisition.

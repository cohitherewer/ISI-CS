 Dumped to death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, June 10: A man whose family didnt take him back from a mental hospital even after he was declared fit committed suicide today.

 Manik Das, 40, of Nalhati in Birbhum, was admitted to the Behrampore hospital last year. The hospital wrote to his family last month that he was fit to return to normal life. But no one responded.

 Das was frustrated as his brother had not come to take him home, hospital superintendent Raghavesh Majumdar said. He hanged himself from the ceiling of a toilet.

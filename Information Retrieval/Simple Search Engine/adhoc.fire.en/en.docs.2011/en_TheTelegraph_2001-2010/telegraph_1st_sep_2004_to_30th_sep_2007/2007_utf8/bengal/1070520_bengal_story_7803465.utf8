 Calcutta, May 19: Priyadarshini Banerjee has made a habit of topping exams.

 The Modern High School girl has scored 98.75 per cent in this years Indian School Certificate (ISC) examination the highest in the country. 

 The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), however, hasnt announced Priyadarshinis name, saying it is against its policy to accord ranks. It has only said a girl from Calcutta has topped the Class XII board exam. 

 The Telegraph has learnt that Priyadarshinis score is the highest in the city, which makes her the national topper. Besides, a source in the CISCE confirmed that a student of Modern High School had got the highest marks.

 Priyadarshini, a science student who had topped her school in the Indian Council for Secondary Education (ICSE) exam, said she was ecstatic when she found out about her marks this afternoon. 

 She scored 100 per cent in mathematics, 98 per cent in physics and 100 per cent in environmental education.

 I just checked my marks on one of the official websites and am happy to see that I have scored more than I had expected, she said.

 But, Priyadarshini added, her target had not been topping the ISC exam. I had focused more on preparing for the JEE (Joint Entrance Examination), and it helped since the standard is much higher. For the past six months, I have been preparing for competitive examinations, one of which is still due, she said. 

 When Priyadarshini isnt studying which, she confesses, is not very often she reads or watches Hollywood films. I wont be going to the movies anytime soon since I still have one more competitive examination coming up, she said. 

 In school, Priyadarshini used to head her house basketball team and had also dabbled in dramatics and debating. 

 Her formula for success: five private tutors and studying for six to eight hours every day. 

 Priyadarshini said she is grateful to her teachers for giving her special attention.

 The girl had been glued to her computer screen since 9 last night. However, she got to know that she was the national topper only after 4 this afternoon through a news flash on television. 

 The daughter of a doctor, Priyadarshini is busy spinning engineering dreams. She also wants to get an MBA degree after her engineering course.

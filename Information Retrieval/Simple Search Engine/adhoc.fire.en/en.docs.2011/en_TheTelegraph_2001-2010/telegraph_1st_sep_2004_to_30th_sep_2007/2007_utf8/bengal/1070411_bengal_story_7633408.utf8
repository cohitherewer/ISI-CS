The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Chhangu tourists rescued

 Chhangu lake

 Gangtok, April 10: Over 1,000 people, including at least one family from Calcutta, were stuck at almost 12,000 feet for several hours yesterday on their way back from Chhangu lake, one of Sikkims most famous tourist destinations.

 A landslide triggered by torrential rain had blocked Jawaharlal Nehru Road, which goes to Nathu-la, around 13 km above Gangtok, leaving some 200 vehicles stranded.

 The local driver who took Alipore resident Deepa Bis- was and her family to the lake serried by snow-capped peaks told them late yesterday afternoon that the situation was hopeless. He said it would take a long time, maybe a day, to clear the rubble. We had children with us and didnt know what to do, she said.

 The rain had pulled down the temperature sharply and the altitude had made the test of nerves all the more demanding. But Sikkim police and the local travel agents association were prompt to the rescue. 

 Around 40 vehicles were sent to the spot from Gangtok. After the tourists crossed the landslide zone on foot, they brought them back to Gangtok. 

 All tourists were evacua-ted by evening, superintendent of police M.S. Tuli said. 

 A portion of the hillside along the stretch of the road being widened by the Border Roads Organisation had come crashing down. The organisation was expected to clear it by late tonight.

 Ravi Kant from Gujarat will never forget the trip, as much for the breathtaking views and the yak ride along the frozen lake that is beginning to melt with the onset of summer as the real-life thrill of an expedition member. It was a kind of adventure... to walk across the landslide zone. I didnt mind the landslide, but would like to thank those who came to our help, he said.

 Some tourists, however, complained that the vehicles that ferried them to Gangtok had demanded exorbitant fares. The travel agents association dismissed the charge, saying it was a free service.

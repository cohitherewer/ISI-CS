 Needed: Someone to save cops 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, July 9: Policemen at a camp set up following a spate of thefts were overpowered last night and robbed.

 Seven constables had been posted at the primary school in Lakshmighat village, 25km from here. Only two were present when 50 rifle bullets were taken away at 10pm. 

 The goons had disconnected power supply and the constables said they couldnt figure out the number of assailants.

 Somebody gagged me and beat me up. I couldnt make out if someone else was there. Fifty cartridges were kept in a steel box and the entire container was taken away. My colleague was in the kitchen, Sambhu Ghosh told additional superintendent Sujit Sarkar.

 Constable Nripen Roy, who is in charge of the camp, said two policemen had gone to town and three others were out on patrol. I was one of them. The two at the camp were preparing dinner, he said. 

 District police chief Dilip Mondol said: We are trying to find out if the policemen were negligent. 

 Many villagers sniffed foul play. They didnt even raise the alarm after the robbers left, said Jahanara Begum, the panchayat pradhan. 

 The camp was set up on June 19, after several mango orchard owners, who handle a lot of money during this season, were looted.

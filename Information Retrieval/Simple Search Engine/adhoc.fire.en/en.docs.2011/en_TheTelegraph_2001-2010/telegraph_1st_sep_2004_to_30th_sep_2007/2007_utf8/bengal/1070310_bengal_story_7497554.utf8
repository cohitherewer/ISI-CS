The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Buddha bid to leash allies

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 9: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today tried to put his house in order, requesting Left Front MLAs not to embarrass the government by echoing the Opposition, something it had been doing over the past few months.

 The chief minister followed up his meeting with senior ministers from the CPI, RSP and Forward Bloc yesterday with an address to all front MLAs in the Assemblys council hall today. 

 The chief minister told us not to raise questions or voice opinions that might help the Opposition. He asked us not to use the floor of the House to register dissent or reservation on governments moves on land-related issues, an RSP member said later. 

 The allies, who had been needling the government over its alleged lack of transparency in land deals and the industrialisation drive, felt the speech marked a climbdown on thorny issues.

 RSP leader Kshiti Goswami said: The chief minister assured us that all SEZs (special economic zones) would be put on the backburner till the four Left parties resolve their differences with the Centre.

 Happy with his assurances, the allies promised to speak in one voice, at least in the Assembly. We cant break front unity, particularly after what the chief minister said today, said the CPIs Nandagopal Bhattacharya.

 The chief minister made it clear that the chemical hub would come up in Haldia or its adjoining areas. 

 Neighbouring Nandigram had erupted in January following speculation that the government was about to acquire land there for the hub. Some of the CPMs allies were said to have fuelled the uprising.

 Bhattacharjee iterated that no land would be acquired in Nandigram if the residents oppose it and added that the government was looking for an alternative site close to the port town.

 Work on the Tata Motors plant in Singur is moving ahead smoothly, he added.

 Yesterday, he had briefed the core committee of the cabinet on the contours of the agreement with the Tatas. 

 Despite the chief ministers appeals and the partners assurances, the CPM leadership is keeping its fingers crossed. State party secretary Biman Bose asked CPM legisla- tors not to react or retort to fellow members of the partner parties if they voice their dissent in the Assembly.

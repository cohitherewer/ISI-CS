 Child rape bid in salon

 Krishnagar, April 18: When a study has shown there are predators around children almost everywhere, a five-year-old girl in Nadia was almost raped in a salon where her father took her for a haircut.

 Sambhu Biswas, 30, the barber, has been arrested. 

 Police said Purno Ghosh, who drives a bus, left for the bazaar as his daughter waited for her turn with a little boy occupying the barbers chair.

 When he returned, the girl was howling outside the closed salon. She couldnt initially say what happened to her. She told him later that the barber tried to rape her, said a police at Kaligunj, 150 km from Calcutta. 

 The girl was taken to a hospital, where doctors confirmed injury to her private parts.

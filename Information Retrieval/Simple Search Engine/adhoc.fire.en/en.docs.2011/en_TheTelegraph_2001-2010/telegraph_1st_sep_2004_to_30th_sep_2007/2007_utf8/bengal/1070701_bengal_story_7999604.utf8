 Strike stalls work at Tata

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Singur, June 30: Work on the Tata Motors small-car plant here came to a standstill today during a 12-hour bandh called by the CPM to protest against Suhrid Duttas arrest.

 None of the 6,000 daily labourers reported for duty as over 500 members of Citu and the partys peasant wing stood guard at the site since morning.

 Shops and educational institutions, too, remained closed. Some shopkeepers alleged that CPM supporters had threatened them with dire consequences if they did not down shutters.

 Over 200 Citu members blocked Durgapur Expressway for over two hours, demanding Suhrids immediate release.

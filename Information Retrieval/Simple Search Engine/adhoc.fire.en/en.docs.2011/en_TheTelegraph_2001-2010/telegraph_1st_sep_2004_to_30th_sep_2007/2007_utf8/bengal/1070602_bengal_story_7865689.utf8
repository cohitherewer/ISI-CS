The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 North on cloud nine 

 OUR BUREAU

 June 1: On a day three of its students made it to the probable toppers list, North Bengal claimed it had stolen a march over the south.

 Deepak Mukherjee, a former student of Alipurduar Railway HS School and now its headmaster, said: Come to think of it, thats what it is.

 As a region, we may be only six districts with 25 per cent of the HS candidates, but we have two students who have scored almost 90 per cent and at least 10 over 85 per cent, said Sumanasananda Maharaj, the principal of Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Vidyamandir, Malda.

 Mukherjee said his teachers ensure students attend classes. Maybe it is absent in the cities, where life is fast and distractions are more. 

 We give free coaching to our students, he added.

 Narayan Kundu of Balurghat High School and Suvendu Mukherjee of Raiganj Coronation High School, which may not have made it to the glory list but are hovering nearby, also attributed the success to disciplined and dedicated teachers. They help overcome the many obstacles students here face, said one of them.

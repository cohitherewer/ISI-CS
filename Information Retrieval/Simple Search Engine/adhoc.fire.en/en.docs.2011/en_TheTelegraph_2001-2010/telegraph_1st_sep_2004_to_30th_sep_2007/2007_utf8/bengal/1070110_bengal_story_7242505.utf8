 Iron hot, Maoists strike

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Jan. 9: Suspected Maoists gunned down a CPM zonal committee member in West Midnapores Belpahari early this morning.

 Palaram Tudu, 55, had walked a few hundred metres from his house at Jamjurki village to relieve himself when he was attacked.

 Police said Palaram, a member of the CPMs Binpur zonal committee, was on the Maoists hit list.

 His bullet-riddled body was found near a mustard field, 200 km from Calcutta.

 Inspector-general of police Arun Gupta said: We have recovered six spent AK-47 cartridges. Palaram was a Maoist target and he used to stay away from home frequently. He had returned home last night. 

 Around 6.30 am, a band of about 15 rebels all in olive fatigues chased Palaram for some distance, firing all the while, a Belpahari police station officer said. 

 A bullet hit him in the back. But he kept running. Another bullet hit him and he slumped to the ground. The Maoists then pumped more bullets into him, the officer said.

 Palarams sister Kesarmoni said he woke up early every day. We had asked him not to venture out alone.

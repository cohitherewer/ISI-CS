 July 8: Fresh areas in East and West Midnapore have been flooded and four people killed since last night. 

 In Ghatal, an overcrowded boat capsized with about 30 villagers while trying to reach a relief camp negotiating swirling flood waters. 

 Rina Maity, 13, Bulti Maity, 15, and Dipa Maity, 26, were drowned, the local panchayat samiti president said.

 Fourteen-year-old Aftar Ali died of snakebite at Musora village in East Midnapores Panskura.

 The flood toll in south Bengal now stands at 33.

 In Sabang, West Midnapore, 120 villages in the Bhemua, Naoga, Dashagram and Baral village panchayat areas went under water following breaches in embankments of the Kapaleswari, Keleghai and Chandia. Over a lakh people have been affected in these areas.

 Army jawans were pressed into service. About 12,000 people have been shifted to relief camps. 

 The army has also started rescue and relief operations in Dantans Sonakonia, Nilpur and Patashpur villages, which went under several feet of water yesterday. Air force choppers dropped gunny bags packed with puffed rice and molasses on Ghatal.

 In East Midnapore, Egra and Ramnagar were flooded following breaches in the embankments of the Subarnarekha. The Haur panchayat area was submerged in Khirai. 

 Around 50 families are still marooned at Saharda village. 

 The floods have affected over 26 lakh people in the two Midnapore districts and some 22 lakh more in the rest of south Bengal.

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta held out a ray of hope in Calcutta, saying the dis- tricts experienced little rain today and that the main rivers were not rising any further. The situation in Hooghly and Howrah has also improved.

 Dasgupta, who chaired a meeting at Writers Buildings, said steps were being taken to prevent water-borne diseases like gastro-enteritis and cho- lera. Water-purifying tablets have been sent to the affected areas. Relief minister Mortaza Hossain, civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee, the chief secretary and the home secretary attended the meeting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Runaway kids back home

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 10: Two 11-year-old friends ran away from home in Jodhpur Park yesterday after being scolded by their parents for not studying, but were brought back more than three hours later after police found them wandering on Southern Avenue past midnight.

 Lake police station received a complaint from the parents of the girls, who are students of two prominent south Calcutta schools, around 9 pm. We promptly informed Lalbazar control room from where an urgent message was conveyed to all the thanas, said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, south.

 Officers of all 48 police stations in the city patrolling the streets were asked to look out for them, said an officer on duty at Lalbazar.

 Lake police station put its full force on the job. Four teams comprising 30 policemen started searching the area, said an officer of the police station.

 It was B. B. Mahato, a sub-inspector, who finally found them. The moment he took a turn on Southern Avenue from near Ramakrishna Mission at Golpark, the headlights of the jeep focused on them, said OC Sukumar Chakraborty.

 They first spent a couple of hours in the Dhakuria Lakes, hiding in the dark. They then came out on the road and started roaming aimlessly, Kumar said.

 Around 1.45 am, the friends went back home with their parents who had been waiting at the police station.

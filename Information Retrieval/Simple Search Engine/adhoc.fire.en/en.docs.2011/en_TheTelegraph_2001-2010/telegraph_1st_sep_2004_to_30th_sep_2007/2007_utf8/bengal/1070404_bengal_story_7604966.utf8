 Calcutta, April 3: The readymade revolution from across the border is about to sweep the citys retail racks.

 Be it mens clothing or womens garments, apparel of all shapes, sizes and colours from Bangladesh will sit alongside big fashion names if Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs tentative offer of giving Indias poor south Asian neighbours duty-free access becomes reality. 

 The indications came through at the Saarc summit in Delhi, where member-nations explored ways to increase trade. 

 The flow from Bangladesh is unlikely to stop at garments. Ceramic and melamine crockery items, biscuits, soaps and detergents could also be filling mall space. 

 Almost all of Bangladeshs exports to India arrive through Petrapole in North 24-Parganas. Simply because of its proximity, Bengal will feel the impact of the rising imports more than any other state.

 Readymade garments are Bangladeshs principal export. They sell to all the big brands of the West. The quality is good and often cheaper than Indian products, said D.P. Nag, secretary, Bengal National Chamber of Commerce amp; Industry. Bangladeshi firms are part of the chambers annual trade fair.

 Some big Indian brands already outsource shirts and trousers from Bangladesh, but volumes are thin. People involved with the trade feel the imports will increase manifold once duties are gone. India now has complex and high duty rates to protect its textile industry.

 Sources in the garment trade say some of the leading mens brands in India already procure from Bangladesh because its products are of good quality. 

 Despite the advantages, Bangladesh is not happy. That is because India sells eight times more than it buys from the neighbour, causing heartburn across the border.

 Indias exports stood at $1.8 billion in 2005-06, while its imports at $242 million. According to a World Bank report, India also runs a huge trade surplus in informal (unofficial) trade. 

 Once duties are scrapped, experts say some Bangladeshi firms may establish their own brands here. 

 But there are fears, too. Bangladeshi products will impact the unbranded and low-priced segments, a trade source said.

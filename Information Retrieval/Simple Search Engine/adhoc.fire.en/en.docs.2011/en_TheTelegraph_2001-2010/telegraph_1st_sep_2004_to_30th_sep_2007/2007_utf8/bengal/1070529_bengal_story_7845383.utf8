The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Three patients molested

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 28: A Group D employee of a Howrah hospital has been asked not to report for work after being found guilty of molesting three patients last week.

 The authorities of Amaragari Bibhuti Bhusan Gramin Hospital in Amta, about 60 km from Calcutta, have also asked Ajit Ray, 42, not to leave his quarters. However, no police complaint has been lodged. 

 Hospital superintendent Jayabrati Mukherjee said: A female patient complained to ward master Madan Chakraborty on Sunday morning that Ray molested her the previous night. Seeing her complaining, two other patients came forward and complained against him. 

 An inquiry committee was constituted immediately, said Mukherjee. Ray was paraded before the patients, who identified him. 

 This is the second such incident in Howrah in a few days. On May 7, another Group D employee, Shah Alam, molested Babita Sarkar, 27, in the district hospital. He was arrested after Babitas husband lodged a complaint in the Howrah police station. 

 Such shockers, however, are not restricted to Howrah. On May 23, Haren Debnath, a Group D employee of SSKM Hospital, was held on charges of molesting a patient. 

 Debnath, who was standing in for a technician at the hospitals cardio-vascular department, allegedly molested the woman when she was being wheeled in for an ECG. 

 The superintendent of the Amta hospital said: Weve sent the inquiry report to the district chief medical officer of health. 

 Howrah chief medical officer Sankar Saha said he has no knowledge of any such incident but promised action if the allegation is proved.

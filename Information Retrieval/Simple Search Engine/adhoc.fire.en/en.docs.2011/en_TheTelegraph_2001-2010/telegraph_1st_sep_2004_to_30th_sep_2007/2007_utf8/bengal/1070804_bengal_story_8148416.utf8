The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Govt stickler for norms

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 3: Rapped by the high court for its hasty land acquisition in Singur, the government has decided to go back to involving divisional commissioners in the process.

 The land and land reforms department had done away with the practice while acquiring land for the Tata Motors factory to save time. 

 This made the district collectors immune to scrutiny by the divisional commissioners, who are otherwise their bosses.

 The divisional commissioners had the responsibility of overseeing the land acquisition process. They would endorse all acquisition-related files sent by the collectors to the land reforms department. 

 Landowners could also approach them for voicing their grievances.

 However, on June 6 last year, just before the acquisition in Singur began, the land reforms department issued a notification, saying the divisional commissioners would have no role in the land acquisition process.

 It cited a common complaint made by collectors the divisional commissioners took too much time to clear files.

 However, after facing flak from the court over cutting corners in the acquisition process, the department was forced to do a rethink. 

 Land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah met the commissioners of Burdwan, Presidency and Jalpaiguri divisions last week and told them their powers would be restored, but they would have to clear files on time.

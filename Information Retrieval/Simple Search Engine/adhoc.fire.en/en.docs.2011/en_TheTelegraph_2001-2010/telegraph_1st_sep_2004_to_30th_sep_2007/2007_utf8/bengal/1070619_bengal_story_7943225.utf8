 Calcutta, June 18: The Centre is expected to ban sea fishing in the east coast states, including Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa, between April 16 and August 31 every year. 

 The ban is already in place between April 16 and May 31. State fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda said the extension was necessary to cover the breeding period. 

 He said a meeting has been convened at Writers Buildings tomorrow. 

 Calcutta: Amar Goswami, believed to be a relative of a senior RSP leader, was arrested on Sunday for stealing power from the supply line to his Bediapara factory on the northern fringes of the city. CESC officials came to know about the factory and lodged a complaint at Dum Dum police station. Goswami, a local CPM leader, was released on bail on Monday night. The North 24-Parganas superintendent of police denied knowledge of any such arrest.

 Chinsurah: Palash Malik, 17, was arrested on Monday for trying to extort Rs 30,000 from his father by staging his own abduction. Police said Palash, who went missing from his Goghat home on Saturday, asked his friend Suman Chandra to make a ransom call to his farmer-father, asking him to come to Joyrambati in Bankura with Rs 30,000. The police arrived there to find Palash waiting alone.

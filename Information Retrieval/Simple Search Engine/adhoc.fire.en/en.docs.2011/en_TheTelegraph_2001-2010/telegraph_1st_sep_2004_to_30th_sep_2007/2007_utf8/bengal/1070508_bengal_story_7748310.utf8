The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 345 kg of ganja in Bolero

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, May 7: A Mahindra Bolero packed with around 345 kg of ganja (cannabis) drove into a Narcotics Control Bureau net in Murshidabads Farakka last night.

 The consignment, valued around Rs 1 crore, was coming from Manipur to Bengal, the bureau said. 

 Burdwan, where the car was headed, is believed to be the nerve centre of the racket and the bureau has only discovered its tip.

 The ganja was packed in small parcels and concealed in the cars false ceiling and inside seat covers. Preliminary investigations have revealed that the consignment was meant for a druglord at Purbasthali in Burdwan, a senior officer of the bureau said.

 The man, whose identity the bureau declined to reveal, is said to be the source of ganja available across Bengal and in Calcutta. 

 The man driving the Bolero and his helper have been arrested. The bureau said they were being questioned and that raids across the state were likely.

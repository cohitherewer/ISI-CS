The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Lawyers defy bar, call strike

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 9: The state bar council has called a ceasework on Tuesday, going against a Supreme Court order banning strikes by lawyers.

 About 25,000 lawyers across the state will not attend court for a day to protest alleged atrocities on their colleagues.

 In December 2001, the apex court had ruled that lawyers are engaged in public service and should not participate in strikes.

 Since 2001, we havent called strikes. But the situation is alarming now. Our members are being attacked by police and state government employees. The government is not taking any step. So we have no option other than to go for ceasework, said council head Sanatan Mukherjee.

 He alleged that government employees had manhandled lawyers inside the Diamond Harbour court complex last week when they accused some jail employees of extorting money from prisoners.

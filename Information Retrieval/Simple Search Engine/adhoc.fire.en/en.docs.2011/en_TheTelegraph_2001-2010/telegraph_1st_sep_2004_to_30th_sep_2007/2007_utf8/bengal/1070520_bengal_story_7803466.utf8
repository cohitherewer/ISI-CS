The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Medical facelift

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 19: The citys private hospitals, nursing homes and the Indian Medical Association hopes to stem migration of patients with a joint effort at an image makeover for the states healthcare system.

 At Medi Summit 2007 held in the city today, that effort translated into the setting up of a common platform the IMA Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Forum that will address several issues.

 Every month, around 60,000 patients leave the state for treatment. Of them, around 20,000 go to Vellore.

 Charges of over-billing and negligence during treatment have on several occasions led to a face-off between patients relatives and hospitals and nursing homes. Some have even turned violent.

 In March, relatives of Sudip Singh took him away from AMRI Hospitals in Dhakuria, holding employees at gun-point and without paying the bill. They alleged they had been overcharged.

 Last year, 13 corporate hospitals of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI) had lost Rs 4 crore in unpaid bills, said P. Nimani, the secretary of the IMAs Calcutta branch. 

 The forum also plans to ask the health department to make medical insurance compulsory for everyone. 

 This would solve the problems of payment of bills by those who cannot afford to, said AHEI secretary Rupali Basu.

 Also on the agenda are a corpus fund to help accident victims and legal cells at hospitals to tackle hooliganism.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Lending link to trader murder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Uttam Chaurasia

 Calcutta, Aug. 4: Lending money to local traders at a high rate could have proved fatal for Burrabazar trader Uttam Chaurasia last night.

 Police are now trying to prepare a list of those who owed money to the man who owned a garment shop at Satyanarayan market.

 Four persons, including a Burrabazar goon, have been detained. But the police refused to identify them.

 Chaurasia was shot from point-blank range when he stepped out of the market and started walking towards his car, parked on Ratan Sarkar Garden Lane, around 10pm. 

 One bullet hit him in the head and two in the chest. Three others missed target.

 The assassins fired from two pistols to make sure he died. He passed away on the spot after being struck in the head, a police officer said.

 We are trying to find out whether the murder was the handiwork of hitmen hired somewhere else or local criminals, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police, headquarters.

 Chaurasia, in his mid-40s, left behind his wife and three daughters aged between 11 and 18.

 Sunita, the eldest of the three, said the family had no clue about Chaurasias business dealings. We dont even know how much he saved in the bank. And we have not heard about anything related to business rivalry.

 Singh said the ballistic report would reveal the nature of arms used to kill him.

 The police probe has so far revealed that apart from running a wholesale garment business, Chaurasia was a known a moneylender in the Posta area. In the recent past, he had altercations with some of his clients, who failed to pay him back. This may prove a vital lead for us, said an officer working on the case.

 The police are going through his client lists.

 Chaurasia had got involved in fisticuffs with a person five days ago. He was called Kartik. We are trying to trace him, the officer said.

 A sleuth, however, claimed that most known criminals of the Burrabazar-Posta zone are behind bars. There is a high possibility that the killers were hired from outside.

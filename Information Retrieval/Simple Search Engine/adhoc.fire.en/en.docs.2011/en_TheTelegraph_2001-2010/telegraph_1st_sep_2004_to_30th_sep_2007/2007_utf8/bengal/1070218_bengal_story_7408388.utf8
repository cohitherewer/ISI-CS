 Singur, Feb. 17: Mamata Banerjee today made one last appeal to the government to return land forcibly acquired for the Tata Motors project, adding that the chief minister would be blamed for any untoward incident if he ignores her request.

 Addressing her first rally in Singur since Section 144 was lifted on February 14, the Trinamul Congress leader said the farmers would not allow a factory to come up on their fertile plots. 

 A day will come when you will see the concrete boundary wall around the Tata project area has collapsed because of our agitation. As for the women of Singur, be prepared for a bigger battle, Mamata said.

 The Trinamul chief said Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should follow in her footsteps and own responsibility for his blunders. As railway minister, I made some mistakes. I admit that. Buddhababu should similarly admit his mistake and give back land. When we are talking about a peaceful movement, Buddhababu is threatening re-imposition of Section 144. Ensuring peace cannot be a one-way traffic, she said, adding that the chief minister lacks common sense and is heartless.

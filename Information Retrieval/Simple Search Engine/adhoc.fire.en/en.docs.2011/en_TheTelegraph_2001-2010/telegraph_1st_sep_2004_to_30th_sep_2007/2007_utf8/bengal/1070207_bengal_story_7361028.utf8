The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Feb. 6: An office on Ballygunge Circular Road and a Park Street pen shop caught fire tonight. 

 Both blazes were controlled in about an hour. Firemen said damages were minimal at the store, but computers, furniture and files were destroyed in the third-floor office.

 Alipurduar: Security at north Bengal stations was stepped up after a blast shook Kamakhyaguri on Monday, but police remained tight-lipped on who could have triggered it. Three men were injured and a shed was ripped off four minutes after Guwahati-bound Kamrup Express left the station 26 km from here.

 Calcutta: Gopi Nath Burman, the first doctor to practise in the Sund- erbans, died on Monday. He was 88. Burman, who had worked with British social worker David Hamilton before Independence, went to the Sunderbans in 1966-67.

 Durgapur: A 20-year-old student of a comp- uter institute here has gone missing. Niswarga Das left home at Beliatore in Bankura, about 165 km from Calcutta, on Monday morning saying he was going to a friend. He did not return home.

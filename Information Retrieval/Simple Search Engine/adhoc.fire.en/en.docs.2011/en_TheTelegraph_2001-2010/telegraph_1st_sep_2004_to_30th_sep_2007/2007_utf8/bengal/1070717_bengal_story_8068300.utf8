 Allies upset with Basu

 Calcutta, July 16: The CPMs allies were upset today with Jyoti Basu for saying that those who try to split the Left Front would be wiped out.

 The remark, made at his civic reception, was perceived to be a message to those trying to drive a wedge between Basu and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The allies had almost made Basu the referee in their battle against the chief ministers industrialisation drive.

 Jyotibabus comments upset me. I didnt expect them from him. I had never heard him warning allies like that before. Comments like these would weaken front unity, Forward Bloc leader Ashok Ghosh said. 

 Basu and Ghosh are the only surviving members of the 1977 Left Front government. 

 The RSP and the CPI didnt criticise Basu directly, but said they would continue to oppose the governments arbitrary decisions on major issues. 

 The differences within the front have never been so fundamental, said the RSPs Debabrata Bandopadhyay. 

 The RSP has decided to stand by Kshiti Goswami, whom the CPM wanted restrained from commenting against it.

 Dengue probe, malaria deaths

 Krishnagar/Behrampore, April 30: Seven more dengue cases have been detected in Nadias Betai village, about 150 km from Calcutta.

 As a team from the School of Tropical Medicine tried to assess the situation in the district, three members of a family died of malaria in neighbouring Murshidabad.

 Fourteen blood samples out of 28 have tested positive for dengue, director of health services Sanchita Bakshi said.

 Five people are believed to have been killed by the new dengue strain. Officials in Calcutta had said two of them died of viral encephalitis but the team did not rule out the dengue possibility in the deaths of Gobidna Sarkar and Nityagopal Sarkar of Krishnagar.

 Theyll submit a report on Wednesday, Bakshi said. 

 Kalyani Das, 42, and her daughters Rimi, 11, and Mimi, 17, died of malaria in Sagardighi. Her husband is in hospital.

 Health funds: The rural health infrastructure will be upgraded at a cost of Rs 190 crore. The Centre will give 85 per cent of the money as a grant.

 Holes in Bimans defence of police

 BISWAJIT ROY

Calcutta, Sept. 23: State CPM secretary Biman Bose today defended police saying they did not know Rizwanur Rah-man was legally married to Priyanka Todi.

 But Rizwanurs family and the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights said they had the polices acknowledgement of receiving the information.

 The young man, found dead off railway tracks, left behind allegations of senior police officers colluding with his businessman father-in-law to break up his marriage.

 I have learnt that neither the police nor the family (Todis) knew that they had a registry marriage. I dont understand why questions are being raised about police intervention, Bose said this afternoon. The police should probe the whole incident, including how the boy died, he added.

 Rizwanurs relatives will go to the CPM headquarters tomorrow to meet Bose.

 The computer graphics teacher who lived at Tiljala had written to the civil rights organisation: We submitted letter of information of our marriage at the office of the commissioner of police, DC south div- ision, OC-Karaya police station, OC-Entally police station, OC-Bidhannagar police station and SP North 24-Parganas. The stamped received copies of all these letters are attached.

 All the officers, including the police chief, sent their acknowledgements by August 31. Deputy commissioner (headquarters) Gyanwant Singh admitted receiving the letter regarding information about your marriage registration in a missive dated September 5.

 The couple had enclosed copies of their marriage registration and birth certificates in their letter. This is for your information that we got married under the special marriage act at the office of the marriage officer Shipra Ghosh on 18 August, 2007. The copy of our marriage certificate is being enclosed.... The marriage was performed with our own wish and not under the influence of any external pressure.

 Apprehending trouble, they wrote: We are presuming that our father-in-law/father, Ashok Kumar Todi, may threaten us with dire consequences or create pressure or can send anti-socials or goondas to kidnap us. In view of this, we hope to get protection from your end, if required. 

 Priyanka prefixed Mrs to her signature on the letter. 

 According to a CPM minister from the minority community, the police commissioner had claimed in a report to the chief minister that his force had no idea that the couple were legally wedded.

 The police intervened after receiving complaints from Todi and the girl herself agreed to see her ailing father. The report apparently concluded that as the girl did not return, the heart-broken Rizwanur committed suicide.

 This police version is tot-ally at variance with the facts that our party has gathered, the minister said.

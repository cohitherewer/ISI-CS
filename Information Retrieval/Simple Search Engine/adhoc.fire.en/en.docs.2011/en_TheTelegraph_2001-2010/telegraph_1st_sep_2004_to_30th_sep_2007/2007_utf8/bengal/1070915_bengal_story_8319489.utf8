 Patta plan for Nandigram

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 14: The rural polls around the corner, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government is trying to woo the people of Nandigram with the right to till around 400 acres it holds in the area.

 The land department has sought the East Midnapore district magistrates opinion on the feasibility of such a move.

 Officials said around 400 acres have been identified for patta distribution in Nandigram I block, which was rocked by a violent anti-acquisition movement earlier this year.

 The majority of Nandigram is believed to have shifted loyalties to the Trinamul Congress-led Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee, which led the protests. CPM supporters who were forced to flee the area are still homeless and the villages out of bounds for the administration.

 The government land in Nandigram has been encroached upon by farmers. We want to know from the DM whether the pattas can be distributed given the prevailing atmosphere, a senior land department official said.

 The DM has also been asked to identify the potential beneficiaries.

 The pratirodh committee, which has got wind of the move, has vowed to oppose any government move related to land in Nandigram.

 Sources in the administration said removing the encroachers would be difficult.

 In February, the chief minister had distributed 5,000 pattas at Heria in an attempt to win over the people of nearby Nandigram.

 Power plant protest

 Around 2,000 people in Katwa, Burdwan, today vowed to resist any move to acquire land for a power plant there. 

 The government needs around 1,000 acres in the area, 160km from Calcutta. 

 The protest is being led by the Congress.

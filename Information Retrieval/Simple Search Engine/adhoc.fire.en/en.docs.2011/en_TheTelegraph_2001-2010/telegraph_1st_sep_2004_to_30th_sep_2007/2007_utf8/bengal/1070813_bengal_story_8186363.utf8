The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 City streets under water

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: Many areas in the city were waterlogged after the rain tonight. 

 Mominpur and parts of Behala, Alipore, Lake Gardens, Kasba, Kidderpore and Dum Dum were under water. 

 There is about six to eight inches of water in these areas. The water is receding slowly, said mayor-in-council member Farzana Chowdhury. 

 Mominpur, where a brick sewer collapsed, was the worst hit. The sewer was the backbone of the drainage system here and the water will not recede until it is repaired, a civic official said.

 The Met office said the low pressure hovering over northwest Bay of Bengal yesterday intensified and hit the coast near the Sunderbans this evening. 

 More rain has been forecast. There is a possibility of heavy to very heavy rain in the coastal districts. Fishermen have been warned not to venture into high seas, the weatherman said.

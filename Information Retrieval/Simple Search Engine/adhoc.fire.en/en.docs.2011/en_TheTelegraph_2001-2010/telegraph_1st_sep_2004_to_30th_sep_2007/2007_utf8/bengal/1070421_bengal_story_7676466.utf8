The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Basu admits front problem

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 20: CPM patriarch Jyoti Basu today said the party is still undecided on whether to allow Reliance to retail farm products in Bengal.

 We are facing some problems over this project. The issue was discussed in the politburo and central committee of our party but we are yet to reach a conclusion. The matter has to be discussed in our state committee meeting, too, Basu said after the weekly meeting of the CPM state secretariat today. 

 Basu said the party was opposed to the entry of such big players in the retail market. It will harm the interests of lakhs of small traders and others. A decision has to be taken taking everyone into account. 

 After its last meeting, the CPM central committee had iterated its opposition to the Centres moves to open the retail market to foreign direct investment (FDI) and also cautioned against the dangers of allowing big domestic companies on a large scale. 

 The CPM has decided to launch a campaign against both desi and videsi big players in retail, though leaders like Sitaram Yechury have admitted that it would be difficult to block Indian companies legally and constitutionally. 

 So, the central committee had said there should be curbs on the organised sector in retail trade. 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had drawn up a plan to refurbish the decrepit farm products marketing infrastructure in view of the surplus production of vegetables and farmers lack of access to a larger market. 

 But hamstrung by his partys position, he developed cold feet over the Reliance offer of a joint venture in the Rs 2,000-crore project.

 Although he opposed the entry of US retail chain Wal-Mart, Bhattacharjee had welcomed Indian companies like ITC, Bharti and RPG-Spencer. His government has already given land to German retail chain Metro to sell farm products in the wholesale market. 

 Mamata rally

 Mamata Banerjee told farmers in Singur today she would go to any lengths to ensure that the land forcibly acquired for the Tata Motors project was returned.

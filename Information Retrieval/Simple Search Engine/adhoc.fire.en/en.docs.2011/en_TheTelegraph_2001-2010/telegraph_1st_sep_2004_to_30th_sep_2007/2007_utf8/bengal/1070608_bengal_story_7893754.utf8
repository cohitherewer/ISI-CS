 Unrest in Tekhali

 Midnapore, June 7: Around 500 activists of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee today went on the rampage in Nandigrams Tekhali bazar after reports that CPM workers who had fled their homes were trying to return with police help.

 The villagers believe the police will enter the villages on the pretext of escorting CPM supporters and carry out atrocities again, said Abu Taher, Trinamul Congress leader and Pratirodh Committee convener.

 However, East Midnapore superintendent of police Anil Srinivas said: The incident was totally based on a rumour. There was no move by the police to escort the villagers.

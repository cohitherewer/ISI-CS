 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Tamluk, Sept. 8: Calcutta police today began efforts to identify two officers of Burtolla police station, mentioned in a purported suicide note by two brothers from Jorabagan in north Calcutta.

 The joint note by Asim and Anjan Sen, who drank pesticide and were found unconscious on the Digha beach yesterday, does not give the policemens names.

 The brothers were taken to a Digha hospital. Today, Anjan tried to slit his throat after regaining his senses. Other patients overpowered him. 

 The note said two assistant sub-inspectors had taken a Rs 30,000 bribe to settle a business deal between the brothers and a Burtolla-based trader. It mentioned two other businessmen and two lawyers, all from north Calcutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 No to land return

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 14: The government today formally ruled out the possibility of returning land acquired from unwilling farmers in Singur.

 The land acquired for the Tata project cannot be returned to unwilling farmers, industries minister Nirupam Sen told a cabinet core committee meeting at Writers.

 Besides Sen and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, ministers from the Forward Bloc, RSP and the CPI were present.

 Sen said he had told Jyoti Basu that there were legal hurdles in returning the land. Perhaps he forgot this while talking to Mamata on June 4, he was quoted as saying.

 Bhattacharjee said nothing could be said on providing alternative land to unwilling farmers outside the project site before the case concerning the process of land acquisition was heard by the high court on June 18.

 CPM sources said a fresh compensation package for farmers who have not yet accepted compensation cheques on which the government is working, would be discussed at Fridays CPM state secretariat meeting before it is sent to Mamata Banerjee.

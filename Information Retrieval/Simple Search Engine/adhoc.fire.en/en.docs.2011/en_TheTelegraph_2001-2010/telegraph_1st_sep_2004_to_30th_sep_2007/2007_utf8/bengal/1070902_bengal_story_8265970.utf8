 Brothers go missing 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 1: Two brothers aged 10 and 11 are missing since they went to school yesterday. 

 Kalpana Dubey dropped her sons Suresh and Rajesh at Brajamohan High School in Thakurpukur in the morning. But she did not find them after classes.

 The family living on KK Road in Thakurpukur has not received any ransom call. So, it does not look like the two were kidnapped, said South 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar.

 Suresh is in Class VI and Rajesh in Class V. I called my husband and went to the police after I could not find them in school, Kalpana said.

 The police said the siblings attended all the classes yesterday and took their unit tests. The mother came to fetch them a few minutes after the school gave over, said an officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 No money for New Year, man kills himself

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, April 15: Humiliated by his wife for being unable to buy their children new clothes for the Bengali New Year, a 35-year-old barber killed himself last night. 

 Police said Hari Pramanik walked out of his house at Sribas Pally in Nadias Chapra around 9 pm and hanged himself from a mango tree about 5 km away.

 Hari could not bear his wifes barbs for not being able to buy her and their children new clothes, said Suman Chatterjee, the officer in charge of Chapra police station, about 130 km from Calcutta.

 He earned only about Rs 30 a day going around villages, cutting hair, shaving and clipping nails. His wife Swapna found it hard to cope with the poverty and apparently lost temper often. 

 As the New Year approached, she pressured him for new clothes, which Hari could not afford. How could he? He could not provide them two proper meals a day, said Tarak Biswas, a neighbour.

 Another resident of Sribas Pally, Bhanu Pramanik, said Hari was very honest and good-natured. He charged a meagre Rs 2 for a haircut and Re 1 for shaving. 

 Haris 75-year-old mother lived with his wife, two daughters and a one-and-half-year-old son. When he returned home from work yesterday, Swapna demanded new clothes for the family members and forced him to take them out to the Charak Mela near the bazaar.

 Hari loved his wife and children and took them to the mela happily. But he could not buy them anything, said Bipul Pramanik, a villager. 

 The couple had a tiff on the fairground, too. Swapna wanted at least a set of glass bangles, which Hari couldnt give her, said Bipul.

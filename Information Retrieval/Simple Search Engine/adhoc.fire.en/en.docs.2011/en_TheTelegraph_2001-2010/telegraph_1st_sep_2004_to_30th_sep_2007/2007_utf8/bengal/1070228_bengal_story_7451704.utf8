The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Over 2200 children missing, 30 found

 A grab of one of The Telegraph reports on girl trafficking

 Calcutta, Feb. 27: Over 1,400 girls went missing from Bengal last year. Only 20 could be traced. 

 The lure of jobs and a better life outside is leading girls from the state to prostitution and fake marriage dens, a senior CID officer said.

 Instances of trafficking have nearly doubled in the past three years. 

 According to a website on missing persons managed by Bengal police and the National Informatics Centre, around 3,700 people went missing in 2004 and 2005 put together. The number was over 5,600 last year. 

 According to police intelligence, south Bengal is teeming with traffickers in the garb of recruiting agents, who promise jobs in factories or as domestic help and take the girls away. 

 In most cases, poor village parents consent to the girls leaving home and contact police when they become out-of-touch with their daughters altogether.

 Not only girls, 882 boys went missing from the state last year. Ten of them were traced.

 The number of women who went missing last year is also very high 1,787, a senior CID officer said.

 According to police records, South 24-Parganas tops the list of districts with most number of missing persons. Nadia, Murshidabad and Howrah follow. 

 In 2006, over 1,500 people went missing from South 24-Parganas alone. 

 It is not just a single factor but a combination of them that led to the rise in numbers, CID inspector-general D.P. Tarania said. 

 Both skilled and unskilled hands migrate. Another section steps out looking for a living owing to lack of a definite source of income, he added.

 The Telegraph had carried a series of reports on how traffickers thrive amid poverty and increasing aspirations.

 Tarania said some of those who go missing also come back, but do not report to the police. He admitted that similarly, many disappearances go unreported.

 The Bengal police, he added, lack the infrastructure to launch a bigger search for those missing.

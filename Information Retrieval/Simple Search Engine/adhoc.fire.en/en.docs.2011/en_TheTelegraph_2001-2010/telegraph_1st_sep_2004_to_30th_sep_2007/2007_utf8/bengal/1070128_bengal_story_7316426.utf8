The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Pumps run out of petrol

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 27: Petrol pumps across the city are going dry as the strike called by the West Bengal Tankers Association entered the third day today.

 Tankers, demanding better freight rates, have stopped supply from the Mourigram and Budge Budge oil depots since January 25.

 Already, 20 of the citys 145 pumps have gone dry, including 11 belonging to Indian Oil Corporation. We think most others will run out of petrol by tomorrow evening, said an IOC spokesman.

 Were offering transporters the rates prevailing in Delhi, but they are demanding almost 35 per cent more. We managed to bring four tanks of fuel yesterday from the Rajbandh depot near Durgapur. But this morning, when the company-owned tankers went there, the strikers locked them up, he added.

 The strike was extended to Siliguri today.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty will meet representatives of oil companies and the tankers association on Monday.

 IOC officials said if the strike continues till Wednesday, supply of aviation turbine fuel to Dum Dum airport would be affected. The fuel is mainly supplied from the Mourigram depot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 From CPM, with love

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 19: Four days after he dubbed her a trouble-maker, Jyoti Basu sent a bouquet of pink roses to Mamata Banerjee. Not to be left behind, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee sent a yellow bunch a few hours later.

 The flowers were a way of saying get well soon to the Trinamul Congress chief, who underwent a gallstone operation yesterday. But they could be meant as much to make her change her heart. 

 Whether Mamata, who has not minced words in her opposition to the governments industrialisation drive, will step out of the south Calcutta nursing home singing a different tune is difficult to tell.

 The red roses that the chief minister had earlier sent, after she ended her fast over the Tata Motors project, didnt have any such impact. But the change of colour of the chief ministers roses and Basus gesture? Well.

 On a small piece of white paper tied to the roses, Bhattacharjee wrote: Aapni taratari bhalo hoye uthun (get well soon).

 There were more roses for Mamata from the CPM today state secretary Biman Bose, Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim being the others wishing her a speedy recovery. 

 Trinamul functionaries at the nursing home said they were overwhelmed.

 Till the other day, the CPM leadership knew only to criticise Mamata, said one of them. Now they are all trying to placate her.

 A CPM leader wished Mamata would feel more inclined to discuss land acquisition with the government when she recovers.

 Calcutta, July 7: A bus rammed into the railing of Bridge No. 4 in Park Circus and miraculously stopped short of crashing into a lane below through which heavy, rush-hour traffic was speeding by.

 The driver jumped out of his cabin and ran away screaming for help, said Saiful Islam of Dilkhusa Street, a witness.

 A reason why the bus didnt topple over could be that there were not too many passengers. Four of them suffered cuts and bruises but the rest escaped unscathed.

 The bus, on route 202, was on its way from Science City to Nagerbazar. Around 6.10 in the evening, we heard a sound and turned to find a part of the bus hanging from the railing, said Saiful. 

 Police said the driver possibly realised that the brakes had failed and ensured the bus didnt hit other vehicles or veer towards the railing on the other side, 20 feet below which run railway tracks.

 But the heavy traffic on the lane leading to EM Bypass could have also spelt disaster. We shudder to think what would have happened had the bus toppled over, Saiful said.

 As the bus came to a halt, the passengers started screaming in panic. Two elderly women were bleeding. One of us stopped a car and many joined us to pull the injured out, said Moidul Islam. They were taken to Calcutta National Medical College.

 Traffic was stopped on both flanks till a crane arrived to pull the bus back. But with gear oil spilled on the road, traffic continued to crawl on the Park Circus Connector till late tonight.

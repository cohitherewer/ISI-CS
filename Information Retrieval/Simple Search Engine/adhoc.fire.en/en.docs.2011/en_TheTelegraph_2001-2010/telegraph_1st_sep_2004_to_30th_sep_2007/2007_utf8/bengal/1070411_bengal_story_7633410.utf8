The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Girl attacked for refusing rape damages

 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN

 Lalgola, April 10: A 17-year-old rape victim and her fami-ly were driven out of home on Sunday and her house was ransacked by a bunch of CPM supporters because she refused their proposal to settle the matter amicably.

 The mob had wanted Rejina Khatoon (name changed) to accept Rs 50,000 and drop the charges against Abdul Alim, a rich landlords son and an active CPM supporter.

 The girl, now living with her aunt, had approached the Murshidabad superintendent of police for justice in February but in vain.

 Abdul, whose father too wields a lot of clout for his CPM links, promised Rejina marriage and developed a physical relationship. He dumped her when she started insisting on marriage.

 Rejina lodged a complaint with the Lalgola police station on February 14, accusing Abdul, 25, of rape.

 The officer in charge asked me to settle the matter with Abdul. When I went to the superintendent a fortnight later, he asked the OC to start a probe. The OC sent me to a home for destitutes, where I underwent a medical test. But Abdul is roaming free, said Rejina.

 The Lalgola officer-in-charge, Subrata Majumdar, said: Several raids were conducted, but Abdul is absconding.

 Rejina, a bidi worker, lost her labourer father eight years ago. Her mother disappeared after she left home to work as a domestic help in Delhi four years ago. The teenager lives with her brother Rafikul and his wife at Natatala village, 255 km from Calcutta. 

 After she refused to bow to the villagers, about a dozen of them stormed into her house on Sunday. They smashed its tiled roof and pulled down its mud walls with rods and sticks. They dragged me, my brother and his wife out and threatened us with dire consequences if we dared to return to our village. We fled to our aunt in Lalgola town, Rejina said. 

 This time, she is so scared that she has not lodged a complaint with the police.

 We are poor. We had tried to fight a rich and influential man, but, Rafikul almost choked.

 Although scared, Rejina stuck to her resolve. We are being pressured to withdraw the case in lieu of Rs 50,000. But Abdul has cheated me. I want to see him punished, she said.

 CPM zonal committee secretary Zohak Ali knows about the incident and that Abdul and his father are CPM supporters. He said: Those who have ransacked the house cannot be allowed to go free. The law will take its course.

 Additional superintendent of police Shankar Chakraborty has sought a report from the OC. Ive asked him to take immediate action against those who attacked Rejinas house, Chakraborty said.

 Church claim on schools

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, March 9: A body of churches has asked the government to hand over the management of about 200 primary schools located on church land. 

 District primary school councils now govern these schools, appointing teachers and framing curricula. 

 The Bangiya Christiya Pariseba, however, has written to school education minister Partha De, saying that is not how it should be. 

 Its very unfortunate. Over 200 schools are located on our land, but we dont have a say in their running. The church provides the infrastructure, but the council controls the schools. We want to run them, said Herod Mullick of the Pariseba.

 Nadia primary school council chairman Bibhas Biswas said that in the late 1970s and early 80s, the government had set up many primary schools in private secondary school buildings to expand primary education in rural areas. These 200 are part of secondary school buildings where primary sections were opened by the government. 

 Mullick said the South 24-Parganas primary school council has agreed to hand over the control of about 18 primary schools, mostly housed in senior schools run by the Church of North India. Churches in each district also run some of these secondary schools. 

 As we get grants from the government, we have no problem if financial matters are overseen by the district school inspector but we want control on the appointment of teachers. The curricula may be decided jointly, said Mullick. 

 Josef Biswas, the parish priest of the Chapra Catholic Church, which runs two such schools, said: Well bring in new teachers and set new standards if given a chance.

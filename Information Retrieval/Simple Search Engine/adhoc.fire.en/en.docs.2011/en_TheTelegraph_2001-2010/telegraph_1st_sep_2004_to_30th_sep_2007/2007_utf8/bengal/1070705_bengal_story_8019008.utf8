 Durgapur, July 4: A Class VIII student had to be hospitalised unconscious today after he was beaten up by the headmaster for allegedly entering class late. 

 X-rays revealed both hands of Ritesh Tiwary had been fractured. There were bruises on his chest and shoulders as well.

 Parameswar Prasad, who was accused of hitting the 14-year-old with a bamboo stick, is said to be missing. 

 After a brief recess, classes at AVB Junior High School resumed at 9am, but Prasad apparently caught the boy outside. He is said to have hit him until he slumped on the floor.

 Durgapur circle inspector Pannalal Goswami said: We raided his residence and the school, but Prasad wasnt there. He is absconding. 

 Riteshs sister Guria, who is in the same class, said he had gone to bring an exercise book from cousin Khushbu, a Class VI student, during the 15-minute recess. 

 Prasad Sir, who teaches us mathematics, usually comes late to class. He came earlier today, Guria said.

 When Ritesh fell unconscious, Guria called up father Rajesh, a technician at a private steel factory, from her cellphone. 

 Rajesh found his son lying unconscious in the staff-room. 

 The headmaster allegedly offered him Rs 50,000 to hush up the matter. 

 When I threatened to go to police, he apologised and offered me Rs 50,000, Rajesh alleged. 

 My son was vomiting and I had to rush him to hospital. Ive lodged a complaint against the headmaster at the New Township police station. I want exemplary punishment for him, he said. 

 Riteshs classmate Bipin Kumar said the headmaster beat him mercilessly.

 I tried to explain to Sir that I went to bring my math exercise book from my cousin. I had placed it in her bag by mistake. But he refused to believe me and started beating me with the bamboo stick he always keeps with him, Ritesh recounted from his hospital bed this afternoon.

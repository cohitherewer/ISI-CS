The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Hashish en route to Tokyo

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, May 13: Hashish worth around Rs 2 crore has been seized from Calcutta on the way to Japan, sources in the directorate of revenue intelligence said today.

 The 20-kg consignment, allegedly being smuggled from Nepal, was booked for ship-ment by a courier firm as household goods. 

 The official recipient: a hotel employee in Tokyo.

 The directorate apparently smelt something foul because the courier was being paid Rs 50,000 for delivering two boxes that looked like those used to pack CD players.

 Personnel from the directorates north Bengal and Calcutta units seized the boxes packed with deep brown cakes that proved to be quality hashish on test.

 Basant Thapa, who booked the consignment here, was arrested when he enquired about it with the courier.

 Thapa apparently said during interrogation that he had sent such consignments earlier as well.

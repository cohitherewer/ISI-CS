The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Builders face flat quota for the poor 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Realty share

 Calcutta, June 22: The government is working on a policy to make private real estate developers reserve 15 to 20 per cent of their flats for the poor.

 Private developers construct flats only for the rich and the higher income groups. That is why we are working on this policy, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said this afternoon.

 He added that the government was also considering a legislation to incorporate the policy. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee discussed the matter with Union minister of state for urban development Kumari Selja when she called on him at Writers Buildings today. The Union minister expressed concern over the lack of housing for the poor in the metros.

 The chief minister appeared serious about implementing the proposed policy. He also asked principal secretary of urban development P.K. Pradhan to prepare a draft. But the matter is in a preliminary stage and we will have to consult experts before finalising it, Bhattacharya said. 

 If a private developer constructs 500 flats somewhere in Calcutta for the higher income group, he can be asked to build 100 to 125 of the flats for the poor anywhere in the state, the minister said. He need not construct them in the city.

 The government, he added, can sell them at subsidised rates. 

 Bhattacharya cited a similar scheme in his home town Siliguri, under which private developers give 10 per cent of their land to the Siliguri Jalpaiguri Development Authority (SJDA) for construction of houses for the poor. 

 The SJDA has made it clear that it will not give clearance to any developer for construction of flats until he or she gives 10 per cent of the land to it for construction of houses for the poor, he said.

 The Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) welcomed the proposed policy. 

 If the government works out a practical policy, then we have no problem implementing it. If we construct a highrise on Ballygunge Circular Road, it is not possible to reserve 15 to 20 per cent flats for the poor there. But we can allot flats to them in any other place in the state, said Pradip Chopra, a Credai board member.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Blow to image, says Basu

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 30: On the eve of the CPM politburo meeting in Delhi, party patriarch Jyoti Basu admitted that the nationwide uproar over Nandigram had dealt a blow to its image. 

 This kind of incident has never happened before. Campaigns against us were launched across the country. It has created some problems for us, Basu said after the weekly state secretariat meeting.

 He added, though, that the party would cope with the situation and the process of industrialisation would not be derailed. Industrialisation would go on despite the odds. We will move forward with the help of the people. 

 Basu blamed both the party and government for not taking farmers into confidence before initiating the land acquisition drive. This should have been done earlier. Now, the party has decided to mobilise its mass organisations to make people conscious about industrialisation.

 The politburo is likely to discuss more attractive compensation and rehabilitation plans for landlosers to win over farmers whose land would be acquired for industry and infrastructure projects. Some agricultural land has to be acquired, but well make sure that agriculture is not adversely affected. Second, more compensation and proper rehabilitation has to be ensured. We are discussing both, he said. 

 SEZ meet

 A group of ministers headed by Pranab Mukherjee will discuss special economic zones next week, said a PTI report from Chennai. 

 Union IT minister Dayanidhi Maran, who is part of the group, said companies keen to invest in SEZs were upset over the delay in setting them up.

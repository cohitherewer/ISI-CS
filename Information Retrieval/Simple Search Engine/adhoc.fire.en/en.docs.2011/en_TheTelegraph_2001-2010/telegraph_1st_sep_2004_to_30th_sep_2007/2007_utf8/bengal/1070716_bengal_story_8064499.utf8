The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Patriarch is party man

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 15: Mamata 

 Banerjee and the CPM allies may consider him their agony 

 uncle, but Jyoti Basu today made it clear he wont 

 let them play him against Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 

 Those who try to split the Left Front would be wiped out, the CPM patriarch said while referring to the disputes within the front at the civic reception accorded to him by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

 Although the mayor and many others described him as a statesman like Mamata had done time and again Basu chose to call himself a party faithful.

 The honour I received actually goes to our party he said.

 Neither Mamata nor the chief minister turned up at Town Hall this evening. I had invited Mamata and the Congress leaders. I had fixed the programme in consultation with the chief minister maybe he had other preoccupations, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said while receiving CPM state secretary Biman Bose and other Left leaders. 

 Some front leaders had thought Mamata might turn up seeing an opportunity to replay the Basu-good-Buddha-bad campaign in Bhattacharjees absence, as she had done on Basus birthday, July 8. 

 But Trinamul Congress insiders said it would have sent a wrong signal before the party commemorates Mar- tyrs Day on July 21. Thir- teen Youth Congress supporters had died in police firing on July 21, 1993, when Basu was the chief minister.

 Basu recalled the firing, but distinguished it from the one on the Left-led food movement during Congress rule. We didnt try to occupy Writers Buildings forcibly like Trinamul did.

 In a veiled reference to the March 14 police firing in Nandigram, Basu rebuked Mamata for demanding the chief ministers resignation. 

 Mamata came to my house and I told her to discuss the disputed issues with the government. But she demanded the resignation of the elected chief minister, who is also doing a good job. Is it a demand worthy of a responsible Opposition leader? the 93-year-old asked. 

 Basu admitted the government was not the CPMs alone, but reminded the front leaders many of whom were grinning then that bickering within the alliance would serve nobodys purpose. 

 Earlier today, RSP state secretary Debabrata Bandopadhyay accused the CPM of compromising with the forces of globalisation and US imperialism.

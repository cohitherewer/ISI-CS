The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Siege ends with slew of promises

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Raiganj, March 27: Assurances of a house and a job made Sufia Khatoon vacate the school building that she had laid siege to four days ago. 

 Abdul Khaleq, the headmaster of the primary institution at Purba Islampur, 20 km from here, announced this afternoon that classes would be held inside the school building from tomorrow. 

 Classes were being conducted in the open over the past few days.

 Sufias late husband Zahiruddin had donated the land for the school after being promised a job for one of his family members. 

 However, Sufia was told that she could not get one as she had studied only till Class VIII. The mother of four, who worked as a domestic help, cleared Madhyamik last year. 

 But the widow alleged that a CPM leaders relative got the job, for which she applied this year. She occupied one of the two classrooms of the school building with her children and mother-in-law in protest.

 Block development officer Sabyasachi Roy and panchayat pradhan Mangal Barman today promised to recruit Sufia as a Group D staff member in the block or panchayat office once there is a vacancy. 

 Until then, she would be employed as a cook in the school for mid-day meals. 

 Her family would be provided foodgrain every month. 

 Roy also told her that she would be given a house under the Indira Awas Yojna.

 Now the matter has been settled amicably. We did not have to use force to get the building vacated, said Roy.

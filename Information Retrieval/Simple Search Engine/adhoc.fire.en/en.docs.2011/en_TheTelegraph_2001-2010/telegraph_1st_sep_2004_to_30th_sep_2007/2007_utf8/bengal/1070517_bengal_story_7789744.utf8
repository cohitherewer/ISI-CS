 Stink makes students ill in CM area 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 16: Twelve students of a school in the chief ministers constituency took ill today because of the stink from garbage dumped in its backyard.

 Jadavpur Sammilita Girls School has been shut down for three days, with the hope that the filth will be removed by then. 

 Around 1.30 pm, an overcast sky forced the students to open the windows of three classrooms. With the light came the foul smell and the girls started vomiting and had rashes on their skin.

 A dozen were taken to a nursing home, from where 10 were released after treatment. Class VIII girls Sandeepa Saha and Mousumi Saha were transferred to AMRI and Peerless hospitals.

 It occurred minutes before the tiffin break. Some Class VI and VIII students complained of uneasiness and started vomiting, headmistress Sudeshna Chakraborty said.

 An AMRI official said the condition of Sandeepa, who was admitted with respiratory problems, was stable. 

 Chakraborty said fumes were rising from the heap of garbage dumped by residents of Baghajatin.

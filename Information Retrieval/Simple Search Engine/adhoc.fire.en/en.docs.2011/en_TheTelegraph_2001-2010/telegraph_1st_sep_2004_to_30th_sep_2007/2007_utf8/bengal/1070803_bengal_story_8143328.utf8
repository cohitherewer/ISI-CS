 Darjeeling, Aug. 2: Normality returned to the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute (HMI) today, with army officials deciding to reopen it after five days.

 The premier institute had been closed since July 27 following a token strike by civilian employees under the banner of the Hill Employees Association (HEA), N.B. Singh Road faction, a GNLF affiliate.

 The strike was part of a plan to stage a month-long agitation to demand removal of all additional army personnel from the HMI. 

 The decision to reopen the institute had been taken last evening but, with the hill employees objecting to the content of the order issued for the purpose, no breakthrough could be achieved then. One of the demands of the association was removal of the phrase closure imposed upon it (the institute) by those elements. The hill employees body said that since the principal had issued a closure notice, and not its members, there should not be any hint in the circular that the civilian staff were to blame for the shutdown.

 Today, the vice-president of the Hill Employees Association, B.P. Chhetri, said army officials decided to reopen the institute unconditionally. 

 We had demanded a corrigendum, but since the principal told us that he had withdrawn the order and has assured us in the presence of district officials that he would issue a fresh one without the objectionable phrases, we decided not to press the matter, he said.

 Col J.S. Dhillon, the principal, also expressed satisfaction. Alls well that ends well. I am very happy that the HMI has reopened. The civilians and the army have agreed to work together for the betterment of the institute of national importance, he said, adding that he had agreed yesterday to reconsider the order.

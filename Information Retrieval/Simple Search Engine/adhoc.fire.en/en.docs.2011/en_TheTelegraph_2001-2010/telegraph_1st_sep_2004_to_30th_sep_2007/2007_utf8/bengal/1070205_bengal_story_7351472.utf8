 BSF called for doctor dearth 

 RABI BANERJEE

 Krishnagar, Feb. 4: The Nadia administration will use BSF doctors to reach healthcare to remote border villages.

 Following a request from the district magistrate, the border force agreed to lend seven of its doctors to treat civilians.

 A.K. Hajila, the BSF deputy inspector-general of the Krishnagar sector, said the details were being worked out with the district officials.

 The Nadia health authorities will provide infrastructure support and medicines, while our doctors will attend to patients in remote health centres on the border, he added. 

 The districts chief medical officer, Mrinal Kanti Biswas, said an acute shortage of doctors prompted the administration to approach the BSF.

 At present, we have 150 vacancies in doctor posts. Two hundred doctors now attend 70 hospitals, clinics and health centres. Many of them dont want to go to the remote villages, Biswas added.

 Although seven doctors are not enough, they will be of great help, a health official said. 

 Nadia has one district hospital, three subdivisional hospitals, three state general hospitals, seven rural hospitals, six block hospitals and 50 primary health centres. 

 The BSFs seven include specialists in medicine, surgery and gynaecology. 

 We are now preparing a roster for their deployment. They could be sent to our sub-centres once or twice a week, Biswas said. 

 The district administration would provide pharmacists, nurses and health workers to assist the paramilitary.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mall break

 City Centre, the Salt Lake mall, had a surprise visitor on Friday evening. 

 On the way to the airport, Ratan Tata took a small detour and landed up there with Tata Sons board member K. Krishnakumar and Tata Tea MD Percy Siganporia. They walked around, went into C3, the convenient store, looked up the shelves and were all smiles seeing Tata products. 

 There was no shopping, but Tata obliged autograph seekers.

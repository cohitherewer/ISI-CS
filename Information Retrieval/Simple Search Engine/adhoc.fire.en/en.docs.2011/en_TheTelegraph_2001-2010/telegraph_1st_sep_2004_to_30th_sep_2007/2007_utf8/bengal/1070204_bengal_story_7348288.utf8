 Binnaguri (Jalpaiguri), Feb. 3: To north Bengals already long list of militant groups, the tea industry added the name of Maoists today.

 At an annual meeting of the industry, executives said the Naxalites were infiltrating the closed gardens in Jalpaiguri to foment trouble.

 But as the officials complained about how the rebels were trying to win over the jobless workers in closed gardens, a state minister stressed the workers misery and advised the managements to try and reopen the gardens.

 The Tea Association of Indias north Bengal branch chairman, Gautam Chatterjee, voiced the managements worries.

 Criminal activities have increased manifold in and around the gardens. I am equally worried at the disruptive acts by various extremist forces. They are taking shelter in the gardens and instigating the peace-loving workers, Chatterjee said at the associations 36th annual general meeting.

 He stressed that this had created security problems and appealed to the district administration to take steps.

 Urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, making a rare appearance at a tea industry meeting, advised the managements to give the utmost importance to reopening the closed gardens.

 The women and children (of the labourers) are the worst sufferers, he said.

 All but one of the 14 closed tea estates in north Bengal are in the Dooars region of Jalpaiguri. Some, like Kalchini and Raimatang, have been closed for over four years.

 More than 30,000 labourers and their families are living in poverty and squalor, grappling with disease and crime.

 News of the latest closure came as the meeting was in progress. Jalpaiguri additional superintendent of police Tapas Das said an indefinite closure had been declared at Ingdong tea garden, Malbazar, following a wage dispute.

 Over 1,200 labourers have become idle. If the garden does not reopen soon, there will be law and order problems. Trafficking of women has already become a major problem, Das said.

 Every fortnight or so, we receive reports of young girls being trafficked to northern India from these gardens, where a ring of traffickers is at work.

 Tea association vice-president Shashank Prasad requested the minister, who is an enterprising member of the cabinet from north Bengal, to come to the industrys aid.

 He called for the formation of a special cell that would work out a revival package after deciding the case of each tea garden on merit.

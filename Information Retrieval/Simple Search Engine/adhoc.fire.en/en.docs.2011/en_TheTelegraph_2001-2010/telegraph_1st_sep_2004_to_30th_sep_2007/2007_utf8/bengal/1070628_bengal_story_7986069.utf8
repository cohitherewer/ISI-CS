The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cloud on chemical hub meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 27: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said he was still hopeful of a consensus on the proposed chemical hub in Haldia but added that the Trinamul Congress should suggest a location.

 I have written a letter to all parties but I am yet to receive a reply from the Trinamul. I am expecting it, the chief minister said.

 An agreement on the project cannot be reached without the Trinamul which, along with Jamait Ulema-i-Hind, SUCI and the Naxalites, remains opposed to setting up the venture close to the Haldia port at the cost of farmers.

 Resistance is also coming from within the Left Front. Disputes at Nandigram and Singur have not been resolved, so an all-party meeting on the hub remains uncertain, RSP veteran Kshiti Goswami said.

 Forward Blocs Asoke Ghosh has written to the working president of the state Congress, Pradip Bhattacharyya, saying talks would be held at an appropriate time. Bhattacharyya wanted to know the fate of the all-party meeting.

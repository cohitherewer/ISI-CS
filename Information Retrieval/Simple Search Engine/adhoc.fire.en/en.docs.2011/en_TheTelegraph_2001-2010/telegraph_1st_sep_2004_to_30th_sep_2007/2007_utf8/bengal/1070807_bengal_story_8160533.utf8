 Rotting body in Khejuri

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Nandigram/Haldia: Aug. 6: A decomposed body was found embedded in mud on the bank of the Haldi in Khejuri today, triggering a wave of tension along the Nandigram border. 

 Hours later, there was a long exchange of fire between Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee and CPM supporters. Bombs were hurled freely at Tekhali around 7.30pm.

 Police were unable to say how the body came there. 

 Pratirodh Committee leaders such as Abu Taher said the body was that of a CPM-backed goon hired to attack them on July 29. Taher claimed two more bodies were found, but police did not confirm that.

 Two CPM supporters died in the July 29 gunfight. The party called a 12-hour bandh in Nandigram and Khejuri today to protest against the killings. The bandh had impact in pockets of CPM strength.

 Following reports of trouble at Tekhali, Nandigram officer-in-charge Champak Chowdhury went there with five policemen. Pratirodh Committee activists gheraoed them, protesting against the CPM attack. They remained gheraoed till 9.30, when the firing stopped.

 In Haldia, 23 villagers collected cheques for land acquired by the government last year.

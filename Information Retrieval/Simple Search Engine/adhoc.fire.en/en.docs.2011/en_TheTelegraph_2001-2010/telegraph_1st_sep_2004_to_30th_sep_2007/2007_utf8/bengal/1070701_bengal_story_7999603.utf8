 Mamata spits Singur fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Singur, June 30: Mamata Banerjee today accused the CPM of trying to pressure the UPA government into influencing the CBI probe into the Tapasi Malik murder case.

 The CPM can go to any length to protect its partymen. They are now trying to exert pressure on the Centre so that the CBI inquiry can be manipulated. Thats why the party floated a conspiracy theory after its Singur leader was arrested, the Trinamul Congress chief told a rally near the Singur railway station, about 50km from Calcutta.

 Mamata advised the CBI against bowing to political pressure as it was an independent agency.

 We have faith in the CBI as long as it maintains neutrality. If it fails to do that, Tapasis family members will never get justice. 

 Mamata, who leaves for Delhi tomorrow afternoon, said she would narrate the ghastly torture and murder of the 18-year-old land acquisition protester to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday. 

 The Trinamul leader lambasted the CPM for calling a bandh in Singur today. 

 It is unfortunate that the CPM called the bandh to salute a man arrested on the charge of murdering Tapasi. Are we to presume that the chief minister is not a party to the decision to call the bandh? He is a party state secretariat member as well as the chief minister. So how could he support a bandh on such an issue? Mamata asked.

 However, she made it clear that her party would not indulge in destructive politics. We are opposed to the politics of destruction. But we also want the Tatas to leave Singur. 

 The land campaign course Mamata has charted for her party workers in Singur includes the following: 

 Distribute posters and leaflets highlighting the CPMs role in raping and killing Tapasi.

 Stage rallies every fortnight.

 Organise street-corner meetings demanding punishment for the culprits.

 Intensify the land movement in Bajemelia where Tapasi lived. But keep the protest peaceful.

 Calcutta, Jan. 27: A little boy trying to stand up against his abusive and alcoholic father, a sapling trying to reach out to the sun, women touching new heights freedom can be expressed on canvas in countless ways. 

 Over 100,000 students from 33 city schools, who took part in the Better Calcutta Contest 2006-07, threw up various vignettes of 60 years of freedom, the theme this year. The contest is an initiative of the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Calcutta Foundation to promote social and environmental awareness among future citizens. 

 The curtains came down on the contest with a prize distribution ceremony today.

 The world is your colour palette. Play with it, said Rituporno Ghosh, the chief guest for the evening. 

 Julien Day School, Ganganagar, and South Point High School walked away with the first prize the ICC trophy. The Telegraph trophy, the second prize, went to Modern High School for Girls and the Centre for Special Education, IICP. Apeejay School, Salt Lake, bagged the Art and Heritage Foundation Trophy.

 An evaluation team, comprising art historian Sovon Som, sculptor Uma Sidhanta, painter Suvaprasanna, the trustee and honorary general secretary of the ICC Calcutta Foundation, Rakhi Sarkar, and ICC secretary-general Rajeev Singh, had visited various schools to pick the winners. 

 We had to select the winning pieces from such a marvellous collection of work. We were surprised to see that some of the participating schools worked under severe financial crunch, said Sarkar.

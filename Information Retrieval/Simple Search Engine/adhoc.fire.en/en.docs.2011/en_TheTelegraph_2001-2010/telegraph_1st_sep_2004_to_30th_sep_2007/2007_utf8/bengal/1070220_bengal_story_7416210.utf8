The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Land bill impasse continues

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 19: A CPM-Forward Bloc meeting today failed to break the deadlock over the rural land ceiling bill.

 It was the first of a series of meetings that the CPM has lined up with its Left Front partners the Bloc, RSP and CPI who are opposed to any relaxation in the ceiling. But it is a must for the government with a slew of infrastructure and commercial projects and biotech parks waiting in the wings. 

 The allies have linked the Land Reforms (Amendment) Bill, 2006, with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees desire to have special economic zones (SEZs) across the state.

 The chief minister told the Bloc leaders that he would go slow on the SEZ proposals and follow the course decided by all the Left parties on amendments to the central SEZ act. 

 But he also pointed out that if the ceiling was not relaxed, projects like the 100-acre biotech park with IIT Kharagpur and health and knowledge cities would get stalled. 

 The amendment should come through. Talks will continue, he said at Writers. 

 The Blocs Naren Chatterjee said: We have made it clear that we are still opposed to it.

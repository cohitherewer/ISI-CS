The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Hint at pressure on CBI

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Basu: Wait for verdict

 Calcutta, June 29: CPM warhorses are circling the wagon and standing by Suhrid Dutta, unable to dump him because of his high-profile association with the Singur project mobilisation.

 The party dubbed his arrest in the Tapasi Malik murder a political conspiracy. 

 Suhrid, the CPMs Singur zonal committee secretary, and party worker Debu Malik were arrested by the CBI yesterday.

 I cant say whether it is a political conspiracy as the matter is sub judice. But my party thinks so. Otherwise why should the dead body of the girl be left in our area (the land acquired for Tata Motors unit)? Now let us see what the court says, Jyoti Basu said.

 The decision to defend Suhrid was taken at the partys state secretariat meeting today. The CPMs acting state secretary, Benoy Konar, said a lawyer would be engaged for him as well.

 We cant desert him when he was at the forefront of the partys campaign for industrialisation in Singur. He has been falsely implicated in the murder, Konar said. 

 However, realising that it is difficult to make the conspiracy theory stick when the CPM holds sway at the Centre, the party said the charge was levelled at individual officers, not the CBIs monitoring authority.

 Definitely, its a political conspiracy because the arrest has been made when we are in the middle of a political battle over Singur and industrialisation in general. However, we are not blaming the Prime Minister or his office for it. But there is political pressure on the CBI. The individual CBI officers are also vulnerable to pressures, bias and allurements, Konar said.

 Other CPM leaders like Rabin Deb indicated the party would raise questions at the proper level on the role of some senior CBI officers working in the state. They cited the proactive role of officers probing the Chhoto Angaria killings in 2001, in which two CPM leaders were accused.

 But unlike Suhrid, his protg Debu will not enjoy the partys support and might be treated as an accomplice to the conspiracy. We cant comment on Debus role in Suhrids arrest. But the CBI may turn him into an approver in the case, Konar said. 

 An approver is an accused who turns key witness for the prosecution in the hope of reduced punishment. 

 After Maliks arrest, CPM state secretary Biman Bose and Konar had denied his ties with the party despite him playing a key role in Singur land acquisition process.

 Mamata potshot

 Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee today scoffed at the CPMs claim. The CPM is now talking of a political conspiracy as the party stands badly exposed. After Tapasis murder, CPM leaders have been trying to suppress evidence and the CBI should now look into this aspect. Its unfortunate to see Alimuddin Street protecting rapists and murderers, she said.

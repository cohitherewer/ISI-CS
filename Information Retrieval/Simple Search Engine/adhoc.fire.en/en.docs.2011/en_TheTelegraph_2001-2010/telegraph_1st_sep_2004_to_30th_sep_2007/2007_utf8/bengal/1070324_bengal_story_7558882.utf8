 Singur probe prod

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 23: The government today asked the CBI to expedite the probe into the death of Tapasi Malik in Singur last December, in a move being seen as an attempt to deflect attention from the Nandigram findings.

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb called up the Prime Ministers Office this morning and asked officials to ensure that the investigation is completed soon.

 The case dates back to December 18, 2006. A case was lodged in Singur police station, which was later on handed over to the CBI. So much time has elapsed since then, but we have no idea about the progress of the investigation. We want to know how far the CBI has solved the case, Deb said.

 Tapasi was throttled and burnt to death on a plot marked for the Tata Motors factory, a stones throw from her home. Her death further fuelled the anti-land acquisition fire, with Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee calling a two-day bandh, which was called off later. 

 Asked why the state was so keen on speeding up the probe, Deb said: The Singur issue is still very much alive.

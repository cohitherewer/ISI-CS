The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Delhi pat for Buddha drive

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: Bengals performance under the urban renewal mission has been better than all other states, an internal assessment by the ministry of urban development has shown.

 According to officials, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government has been the most prompt, most rigorous and most sincere in its attempts to urbanise Calcutta and its satellite townships. 

 He may be facing problems back home, but were really happy with him, said a senior official, who has been touring each of the 63 cities the ministry plans to modernise in the first stage of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.

 If the hint was to the battles over Singur and Nandigram, the smile on the officials face was a confirmation of the ministrys happiness with the chief minister.

 Under the mission, states were supposed to send detailed urbanisation plans to the ministry, which was to scan them before giving them the thumbs up, or down. The money comes from a corpus to which the Centre and states have contributed 50 per cent each. 

 The plans were to include information on urban issues such as housing, drinking water, sewage and traffic. 

 Calcutta, Mumbai and Chennai, which receive over average rain, were advised to build storm-water drainage systems to avoid flooding. 

 Bengal was the first to submit its plan, and the officials here said that the ones other states have since handed over are pale in comparison. The Bengal plan is among the few that actually seek to make corrections in the areas where the city is lagging behind the other metros, the official said. 

 The ministry recently cleared projects worth nearly Rs 57 crore for sewage and solid waste management. 

 In the ministrys assessment, most other states plans were attempts to cover up shortcomings. 

 An official said the certificate could mean faster clearance for new projects.

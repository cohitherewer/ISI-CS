The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Tortured, boy flees college

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Raiganj, Sept. 5: A boy has fled his college in Bolpur after students of an adjacent engineering college allegedly scalded him with cigarette butts and made him walk on a parapet.

 First-year law student Sagnik Chakrabortys father lodged a police complaint here today, a day after he brought him back.

 Sagniks Bengal Law College and the Bengal Institute of Technology and Management, whose students allegedly ragged him, are run by the same Multiple Education and Manpower Development Trust. 

 The boy said the tech school students singled him out for torture frequently. There was a freshers welcome in the first week of August, but there was no ragging on our campus, Sagnik said.

 The torture began a few days later. They slapped me when I threatened to shout for help. I was taken forcefully to their mess and told to address my parents in filthy language. 

 Raiganj inspector-in-charge Pradeep Chakrabarty said the complaint would be forwarded to his counterpart in Bolpur. 

 A doctor who attended to Sagnik at the Raiganj district hospital confirmed that the bruises were from burning cigarettes.

 Subrata Roy, the law college teacher-in-charge, tried to shrug off responsibility saying the allegations were against students of another institution. The tech school denied knowledge of any such incident.

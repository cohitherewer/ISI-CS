 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, March 30: Tata Motors managing director Ravi Kant has expressed satisfaction with the progress of work in Singur. 

 During a visit to the car plant site yesterday, he spoke to architects Shapoorji Pallonji, who are erecting a prefabri- cated structure, and asked them to finish the job fast, commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said. 

 Trinamuls Partha Chatterjee accused Kant of behaving like a poli-tician while commenting on his statement that the Tatas had chosen Singur because it made business sense. The government called Chatter-jeeirresponsible.

 Calcutta: The Hind Motors management has invited representatives of all five registered unions to a meeting on April 8 to break the impasse at its Uttarpara plant. The suspension of 15 employees and alleged non-payment of salary for two months led to a strike on March 13.

 Durgapur: Some 500 Citu and Intuc supporters held four Durgapur Cement Works executives hostage till late on Friday night demand-ing a job for a relative of a worker who was run over by a truck while returning home. They are demonstrating with the body and have surrounded the executives, said Sankha Biswas, the Durgapur police station officer-in-charge.

 Calcutta: Finance minister Asim Dasgupta told the Assembly that he has written to the Union home ministry seeking a ban on online lottery. It ruins the poor, he said.

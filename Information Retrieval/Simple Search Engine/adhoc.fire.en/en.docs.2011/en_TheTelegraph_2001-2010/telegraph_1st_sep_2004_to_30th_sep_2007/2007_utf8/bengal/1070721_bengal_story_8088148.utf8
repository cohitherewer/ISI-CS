 Boy faints after hit on the head

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Suri, July 20: A Class X student fell unconscious after a teacher hit him and all his classmates yesterday. 

 Sandip Chakraborty was hit on the head.

 A student had mimicked a dogs bark, angering Tirthamoy Saha, a biology teach-er at Kotasur High School in Birbhum. 

 Saha asked who was behind the mischief but no one owned up. He then started hitting all the students with a stick. 

 When Saha hit Sandip on the head, he slumped to the ground. 

 As he crouched in pain, we raised an alarm and Saha Sir stopped hitting us. Some of us rushed to the headmaster, said Rajib Saha, a classmate.

 Headmaster Kalpataru Chatterjee rushed Sandip to a primary health centre. He was later admitted to Suri Sadar Hospital, about 260km from Calcutta.

 Students locked up the school office and stalled classes today. 

 Chatterjee sent an SOS to block development officer Koushik Sinha and Sandip Chattaraj, the officer in charge of the local Mayureswar police station. Guardians were called to the meeting.

 The students were pacified only after Chatterjee assured them that the managing committee would discuss the the charge against the teacher. Saha would be punished if found guilty, the headmaster promised.

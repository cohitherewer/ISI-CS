 Passengers hurt in train jump-off 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 22: Seven passengers were injured when they jumped off a Hasnabad-bound local train seeing sparks on the roof of the first compartment this morning.

 Passengers noticed the sparks soon after the train left Barasat station around 9.15.

 Train services were halted for over an hour, resuming around 11am. 

 The seven, who suffered cuts in their hands and legs, were taken to the Barasat district hospital and released after receiving first aid. 

 A government railway police official said the sparks flew when high-voltage supply lines got entangled with the pantograph the device connecting the train to the wires above. 

 We panicked seeing the sparks on the roof just below the pantograph. As a rumour spread that fire had engulfed the train some passengers jumped out, said Asim Ghosh, who was in the third compartment. Thankfully, the train was moving at a slow pace.

 Railway officials detected the fault and switched off the power supply.

 Some passengers protested at Barasat station manager P.N. Laus office but Rapid Action Force and GRP personnel dispersed them.

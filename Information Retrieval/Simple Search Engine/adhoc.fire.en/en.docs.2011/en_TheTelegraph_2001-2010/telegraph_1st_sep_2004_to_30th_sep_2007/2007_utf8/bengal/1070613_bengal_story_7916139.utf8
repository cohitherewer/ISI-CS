 Cong hub query

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 12: The Congress has sought information whether the proposed chemical hub in Haldia can be set up without acquiring farmland in contrast to Mamata Banerjees outright opposition to the project.

 The Congress today sent a letter to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee seeking clarifications.

 After all that has happened in Singur and Nandigram, it would not be desirable to take away agricultural land to build a chemical hub. So, we have requested Bhattacharjee to inform us whether agricultural land would be acquired for the project or whether the governments vested land in Haldia would suffice, said state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya.

 Our final opinion would depend on the clarification Buddhababu gives. We cant say yes or no right now, he added.

 Bhattacharyas letter is a reply to the chief ministers note to all political parties seeking opinion on the proposed project.

 I am told that there is about 10,000 acres of vested land in Haldia. So, that can be acquired, he said.

 Mamata has made it clear that the Trinamul Congress is totally against the creation of a chemical hub in Haldia, saying she would not even send a reply to the chief ministers note.

 Bhattacharya has also asked whether the hub could pose environmental hazards.

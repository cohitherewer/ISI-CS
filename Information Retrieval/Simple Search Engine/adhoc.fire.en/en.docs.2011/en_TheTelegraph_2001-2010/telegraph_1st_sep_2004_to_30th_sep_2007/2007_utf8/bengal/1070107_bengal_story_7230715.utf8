The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bikers dead, bribe glare on cops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Deganga (North 24-Parganas), Jan. 6: Two men were crushed by a matador van when their motorcycle overturned and came under its wheels, allegedly after some bribe-hungry policemen pulled their shirts to stop them and threw them off-balance.

 One man sitting on the roof of the matador also died, while the crash left at least eight people injured. 

 Abdul Kalam, 25, was riding the two-wheeler with 22-year-old Sheikh Jhantu sitting pillion on Deganga Road, about 40 km from Calcutta, this afternoon. When it reached a turn to a culvert, Abdul lost balance.

 A matador coming from the opposite end could not slam the brakes on time and ran the two over.

 Minutes later, when the news reached Abdul and Jhantus homes in the nearby Hatiara village, over 200 residents blocked the road for over six hours. 

 They alleged that the constables on duty had tugged at their shirts to demand a bribe when they fell. 

 The blockade was lifted six hours later, after senior police officers arrived and promised a probe.

 Battle won, but war lost to babus

 Majdia (Nadia), June 10: The prize for braving a swelling river and saving 150 soldiers during a war was a bronze medal and a monthly pension of Rs 15. 

 But over four decades after the triumph over Pakistan, Atul Haldar doesnt get the money that an Ashoka Chakra had earned him because the unlettered Nadia fisherman doesnt have a bank account.

 He was turned away from the district collectors office two years ago because a babu somewhere had decided that anyone without an account was unfit to receive money.

 Haldars pension had gone up to Rs 100 a month over the years, but rustling up the money at least Rs 500 to open an account was still almost impossible. 

 He lives on Rs 10 a day, provided by his four married sons, who are daily labourers and earn Rs 25 a day.

 The 78-year-old man, whose skill and courage was once the toast of the establishment, has met officials, written letters and waited for someone to respond, but in vain.

 On September 18, 1965, he was preparing to cast his fish net with his father when he heard the drone of a boat. Through sheets of rain, he saw a big, mechanised vessel chugging across the Ichhamati from Kusthia (a district of the then East Pakistan).

 As it came closer, he could see Indian jawans on it and then, he saw the boat capsize. The river was over 20 feet deep and the jawans were screaming for help. Haldar jumped into the river and his father cast his net. Together, they pulled 150 jawans to the bank, about 130 km from Calcutta. 

 He (Atul) dived several times in the river and recovered much of the lost ammunition.... He continued his efforts the next morning and ultimately recovered almost all that we had lost. The skill and courage displayed by Haldar was highly commendable, Union home secretary L.P. Singh wrote on August 12, 1966. 

 Haldar had been chosen for the Class III Ashoka (later known as Shaurya) Chakra, given for valour, courageous action or self-sacrifice while not engaged in direct action with the enemy.

 He lives on rice, boiled po- tatoes, green chillies and puffed rice with his wife now. 

 What will I keep in the bank? the war hero asked, sitting in front of his hut. Theres also a lot of paperwork to do. 

 No babu has cared to offer him help to get over the problem. Im an old man. I didnt have the physical or financial strength to pursue my case with the collectors office. Rs 100 is a lot for me, said the man, whose gait almost belies his age and heart ailment.

 With his father ailing, Haldar could not go to Delhi to receive the award. The home ministry sent the medal and the citation home. 

 Fellow villagers, who still bask in his glory, prodded him to write to the Centre. He also met district magistrate .S. Meena. 

 I feel ashamed. Well help Mr Haldar open an account. Ive told my office to file a report on why his papers were not readied earlier, Meena said.

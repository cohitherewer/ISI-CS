The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Provider predator for mute woman

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Jan 1: A deaf-mute weaver working at a garment store in the textile hub of Shantipur town was last night raped by a traders son who would often provide her with food and succour.

 The police have arrested the alleged rapist, Rabi Roy, who has apparently confessed to his crime.

 A semiconscious Smita Das (name changed) was dumped in a bush near Rabis house after the rape. 

 Some New Years Eve revellers who were alerted by her groans took her to the Shantipur State General Hospital late last night.

 The woman managed to communicate to police with gestures that pieces of cloth were stuffed into her mouth to gag her during the rape.

 An officer working on the case said Smita, 25, a resident of Battala in Shantipur, 70 km from Calcutta, worked as a weaver in the house of Bibhuti Bhusan Adhikary, 50, a garment manufacturer and trader, in another part of the town.

 She got about Rs 600 a month and was the sole earning member of her family of elderly parents, a younger brother and a sister. She worked hard and her employer trusted her, the officer said.

 Rabi, 25, and his brother lived in the rented house next door, looking after their flourishing garment business.

 Smita was working alone last evening as Adhikary left early to attend an invitation. His wife and children had gone to one of his in-laws house. 

 I asked her to finish her work and return home after locking the workshop. I also told her to hand over the key to the Roys, who are neighbours, Adhikary said today.

 The police said some people saw Smita following Rabi into his house. Rabi and his brother Debashis often gave her food as she worked long hours in Adhikarys workshop. Rabi, who was alone in the house, had probably lured her to his house promising her food. She also had to leave the keys with him, the officer added. 

 Rabi was arrested early this morning. Nadia additional superintendent Subrata Mitra said the police initially had no clue about the culprit. 

 Questioning local people, we found Smita was last seen with Rabi. So, we picked him up, he added.

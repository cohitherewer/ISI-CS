The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CPI wants legal wall for retail giants

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 22: On a cue from their Kerala counterparts, Bengal CPI leaders have asked the government to amend laws and impose curbs on the entry of domestic retail giants. 

 We have been told that the existing laws are not enough to stop the onslaught of monopoly houses in the retail. Lakhs of people will become jobless if they (the big retail firms) are not checked. That is why we want the Left Front government to change the laws before it is too late, CPI state secretary Manjukumar Majumdar said at the end of the partys state council meeting today.

 The CPM wants the Centre to frame rules to safeguard the interests of small traders and shop owners. 

 But in Bengal, the allies the Forward Bloc, the RSP and the CPI are mounting pressure on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee not to let in Reliance and other groups.

 In Left-ruled Kerala, the CPI and a section of the CPM, both partners in the government, have launched a camp- aign against corporate presence in retail. They have mobilised traders and plan to rewrite laws.

 The Left parties are opposed to foreign investment in retail. But the CPM doesnt want Bengal to slam the doors on Reliance, Bharti and other Indian firms setting up outlets to retail farm products in other states. The party feels the move will send wrong signals to investors at a time when the government is inviting investment for industry. 

 The state is trying to clear the path for Reliances farm retail business by treating it as food processing. 

 The allies have accused the CPM of trying to get around the opposition from the Forward Bloc-controlled agriculture marketing board, which has blocked Reliances farm retail plans in Bengal.

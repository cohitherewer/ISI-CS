 Mother beaten amp; thrown out

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE

 Burdwan, Aug. 21: A 70-year-old widow was slapped and punched by her son for seeking a glass of milk after a days fast.

 Surjya Saha, 40, is a well-to-do farmer, but he did not have enough for his aged mother.

 In her complaint to Burdwan court, Padma Saha of Memari said she was driven out of the two-storey house her husband built many years ago and not allowed to enter again. 

 Once a wealthy fish trader, her husband Amulya died of cancer 27 years ago, leaving his wife almost a pauper. 

 The widow worked as a domestic help to raise her three sons, Chandra, Surjya and Tara. 

 Chandra, the eldest, gradually picked up the reins of his fathers business. But he died of a heart attack in 2005.

 Things were fine when he was alive. After his death, Surjya threw me out of the house, said Padma. 

 She stays with Tara, 35, but a labourer, he struggles to make ends meet.

 The old womans drive to get her house back has proved futile. Neither police nor panchayat has helped. 

 In July 2005, she knocked on the door of the Burdwan chief judicial magistrates court. Moved by her plight, lawyer Biswajit Das offered to take up her case without a fee.

 In March last year, the court ordered Surjya to pay his mother Rs 500 a month. He paid Rs 200 to Rs 300 for three months and then stopped giving anything. 

 Padma moved court again last December. Her lawyer said Surjya appeared in court thrice in the past seven months and pleaded that he did not have money for his mother.

 Surjya declined comment. He said it is a family affair.

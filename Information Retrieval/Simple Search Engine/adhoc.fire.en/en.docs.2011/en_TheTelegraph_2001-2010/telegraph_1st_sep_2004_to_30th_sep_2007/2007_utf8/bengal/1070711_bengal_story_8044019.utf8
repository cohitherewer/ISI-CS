The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Campus eye on fine print

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, July 10: The higher education minister announced a new tag autonomous for Presidency College yesterday, but the students are clueless about its pros and cons. 

 Weve asked the authorities about it but we have been told that the college has not yet received any formal instructions. We have no clear idea about what is happening, said Dipanjan Sinha, the general secretary of the Independent Consolidation students union. 

 Autonomy and its implications ruled the canteen, common room and the historic portico on the campus today. 

 One of the most powerful alumni (Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee) of our college has let us down, said two girls, sipping the famous Promoddas tea. 

 Students in the union room were busy drawing up plans signature campaigns to protest marches to express unhappiness with the outcome of the battle for autonomy. 

 The students, who were in school when the demand was first made in the late 1990s, feel that is ideal for their college. 

 The fact that academic autonomy has been denied has come as a shock to most. There is no meaning of autonomy for an educational institution if it does not have the final say on academic affairs, said a union member.

 Implications of financial autonomy like higher fees is also a cause of concern.

 Whatever the status, well be affected the most. So, we are eager to know the fine print, said Himadri Shankar Mallick of third year physiology.

 Speedy review of answer scripts

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, June 20: No more waiting for months or knocking on courts doors to get a relook at answer scripts. Kalyani University will give its students a chance to review their papers in days and point out mistakes in marking, if any. 

 The system of spot review to be implemented from the current academic session is the first in the state. 

 According to the system, aggrieved students will be asked to come to the university on a particular day. For Rs 500, they will get photocopies of the answer scripts they want reviewed.

 The novelty of the system is that students will be allowed to see the photocopies of the answer scripts and give their observations in writing. For instance, they may want reassessment of a particular question if they feel they deserved higher marks, said Aurobindo Das, the vice-chancellor of Kalyani University.

 The students can collect the result of the review after a week, when their claims have been verified by an independent examiner appointed by the university, Das added.

 Ours will be the first university in the state to introduce this novel system of clearing review applications, he said. It aims to ensure transparency in the review system. It will also help us avoid court cases.

 Earlier, students had to move court to get copies of their answer scripts.

 About 20 per cent of the examinees from each stream go to court demanding review. In some cases, the marks are increased. But that hardly helps the students as by the time the review results are declared, they have already taken admission in some other institution, the vice-chancellor said.

 Initially, B.A, B.Sc and B.Com (honours) examinees will be offered the facility. It will later be extended to the rest. 

 Students and guardians often questioned our evaluation process. There should not be any mistake in evaluation and we hope we will be able to minimise the mistakes with the implementation of the new system, the vice-chancellor said.

 Police build force for Nandigram

 OUR BUREAU 

 March 13: The government today spent the day mobilising men and resources for the crackdown in the villages of Nandigram, officials at Writers Buildings said.

 While around 3,000 police personnel were being sent from Calcutta, 30 officers of deputy superintendent rank and 20 additional superintendents are being deployed from the neighbouring districts.

 Over 10 ambulances have also been kept ready at Tamluk, an indication that the government is expecting resistance to its planned operation.

 The idea is to repair the damaged roads and culverts, enter the villages and mediate in all-party meetings so that those who had fled their homes can return, said a senior state government official.

 With the word spreading about police mobilisation, thousands of villagers owing allegiance to the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee started assembling in the villages.

 The East Midnapore authorities have shifted the venue of higher secondary exams from Mohammadpur High School in the affected area to Brajamohan Tiwari High School for Girls in Nandigram.

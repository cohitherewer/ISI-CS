 Church in fight against child brides

 RABI BANERJEE

 Lakshmipur, Jan. 23: About 600 villagers didnt attend Sudip Mondals wedding reception in Nadias Chapra on January 15 because the bride was a minor.

 The church had said in November that no member of the community should participate in the marriage of a child. Or else, they would be excommunicated for five years.

 The girl Sudip married at home, without the consent of a priest or an official was only 16. Their families would now not be able to participate in any church activity, not even during Christmas, said Fr Josef Biswas, the parish priest.

 Josef Gomes, the bishop of the Nadia-Murshidabad diocese that issued the order, said it was long overdue. 

 Child marriage is rampant in rural areas, he added.

 The bar on the Mondals would be lifted after five years with the payment of a fine of Rs 3,000, but the idea is that the fear of segregation would prevent families from getting their girls married early. Fourteen families in seven villages of Chapra, about 130 km from Calcutta, have been excommunicated since November.

 There are over 30,000 Christians in Nadia.

 Last week, a team led by subdivisional officer Joydeep Mukherjee stopped two child marriages in Dhubulia. 

 Most such marriages go unnoticed. The church initiative is most welcome, said district magistrate .S. Meena. 

 Sudip, a cook in Pune, said he married Debika because he loved her and would not get leave in the next two years. 

 Debikas father said: The situation was such that we could not backtrack. 

 Sudips cousin Sanjit, who also works in Pune and married a girl of 17, and his family, too, face excommunication.

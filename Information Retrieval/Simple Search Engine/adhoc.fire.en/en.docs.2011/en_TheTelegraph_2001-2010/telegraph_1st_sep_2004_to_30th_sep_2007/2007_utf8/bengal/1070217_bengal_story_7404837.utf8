 Singur, Feb. 16: When Safikul Sarkar heard last September that his land had been included in the acquisition map drawn up for the Tata Motors plant, he was reluctant to part with it.

 The Sarkars of Joymolla village in Singur, about 50 km from Calcutta, had been farmers for seven generations. 

 Forty-two-year-old Safikul was totally dependent on agriculture on his about four-and-a-half-bigha (1.5 acres) land. It yielded two crops of paddy besides potato.

 But he was among the first few to consent to the land acquisition. And Safikul also ensured that he could continue with farming. 

 His daughter, now in Class VIII and learning embroidery, wants to open a boutique in Singur some day.

 When the local CPM supporters came to my house to explain the need for industrialisation, I asked them what do I do if I sell off my land, said Safikul.

 They told him about the compensation package. He enquired about the land rates in the neighbourhood and realised that the Rs 13.27 lakh he was being offered was quite a sum. There was a lot of money on offer, he admitted.

 But he could not live without farmland. So, Safikul went around scouting for a plot in the neighbouring villages. 

 I located Mukta Belel, a farmer in the adjacent Mahishtigri mouza. He was looking for a buyer for his four-and-a-half bighas so that he could shift to Howrah and settle there with his relatives, said Safikul. 

 He bought the land with a fraction of the money he got for his Joymolla plot Rs 4 lakh.

 He made a fixed deposit of Rs 3 lakh in wife Sahidas name and gave Rs 2.5 lakh to his elder daughter to invest in her husbands potato trade. 

 My daughter put a part of the money into her husbands business and invested the remaining in the post office monthly income scheme, said Safikul.

 With a wry smile, he asked: What do you think? Wasnt the deal profitable?

 His wife and younger daughter Shakila, who is weaving dreams of a tony store like the ones she sees on TV, have no doubt about it.

 Dibakar Das, the CPM district committee member who led the campaign for land acquisition in party-dominated Joymolla, said Safikul was never a CPM worker and he threw some pointed questions at us on our mission. 

 They were able to convince Safikul. 

 The land I bought is also fertile and I can cultivate two paddy crops and use a part of it for potato. I feel proud to have been able to provide security to my family. If the Tata factory had not come along, I would never have had so much cash, said the farmer, looking towards a new future.

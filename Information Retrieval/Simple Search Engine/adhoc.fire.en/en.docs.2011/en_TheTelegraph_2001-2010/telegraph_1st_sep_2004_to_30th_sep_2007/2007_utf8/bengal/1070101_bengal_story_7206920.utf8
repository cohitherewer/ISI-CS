The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Dowry behind Sealdah strike

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 31: A man in his mid-50s was arrested last night in connection with the murder near Sealdah station 10 days ago. 

 Bharat Yadav, who had allegedly hired professionals from Bihar to kill railway ticket-booking agent Panchanan Yadav, was picked up from a Beleghata house where he had been living for the past couple of years.

 Preliminary investigations have revealed that Bharats son Dipak was supposed to marry Panchanans daughter at their ancestral village in Chhapra, Bihar. Panchanan had paid Rs 3 lakh as dowry in advance. But Dipak refused to marry Panchanans daughter at the last moment, said Gyanwant Singh, the detective department deputy commissioner of police.

 After the proposed marriage fell through, Panchanan wanted his money back. But Bharat, a supplier to railway contractors, ignored the repeated requests for the money.

 We are looking for Dipak, who was also involved in the conspiracy, said an officer working on the case. 

 Panchanan was shot dead under the Sealdah flyover in full view of hundreds of people on the afternoon of December 21. 

 The attackers shot him from close on a narrow, crowded lane under the flyover. The killers melted into the crowd, most of whom were hurrying towards the station to catch trains.

 Bharat and Dipak had apparently plotted the murder in Chhapra. Bharat went there in November and contacted professional killers. The father and son provided them every detail of Panchanans activities, like when he left home for work and when he returned, an officer said.

 The assassins came to the city two days before the strike. On December 20, Bharat followed Panchanan and helped the killers identify their target. The location where the murder would take place was chosen by the culprits, said another officer.

 Immediately after the murder, the killers left the city, informing Bharat that they had done their job. 

 Bharat stays in the city alone and his son stays with the rest of his family in Chhapra. 

 Calcutta police are in touch with their Bihar counterparts. The officer said a team would go there to track down the culprits.

 SC relief for Sardas

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Jan. 31: The Supreme Court today dismissed the governments plea to cancel the bail granted to Ghanshyam and Govind Sarda in the blood test kit scam.

 A bench of Justices Ashok Bhan and V.S. Sirpurkar dismissed the special leave petitions filed by the state against a January 19 Calcutta High Court order.

 The government, however, was allowed to make seizures relating to the scam from anywhere in the country. 

 Monozyme India, a company owned by the Sardas, had been accused of supplying blood test kits that had passed their expiry dates and were unable to detect deadly viruses like HIV and Hepatitis B.

 The court granted the bail after going through a report on sample kits sent to the National Institute of Biologicals in Noida, which said they were standard, not fake.

 Govind was held on September 27 last year and Ghanshyam, his elder brother and former Monozyme MD (in picture above), on November 26.

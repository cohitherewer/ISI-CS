The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CPM target in raid and loot

 Nandigram/Calcutta May 4: Around 6,000 Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee activists marched into Satengabari and Gokulnagar today and ransacked 10 houses, a dozen shops and a CPM office as their comrades held police at the nearest camp hostage. 

 The marchers flaunted their guns, swords, rods and bombs.

 Ashok Bera, the chief of the CPM-led Nandigram panchayat samiti, alleged that they fired and hurled bombs indiscriminately. The police were nowhere to be seen when they singled out shops owned by our supporters and looted them, Bera said.

 Committee convener Abu Taher, a Trinamul Congress leader, admitted that his men ransacked groceries, eateries, tea stalls, furniture stores and paan shops. CPM supporters had taken shelter in them, he said, justifying the attack.

 Nearly 1,000 members of the committee surrounded the 50-odd policemen at the Tekhali camp around 10.30 am as the others marched on. The houses targeted today were, however, deserted. Almost all CPM supporters have fled the area since Sunday.

 There was furniture worth about Rs 3-4 lakh in my shop. I lost everything today, said Badal Garu Das of Gokulnagar.

 From Gokulnagar, about 1,200 committee activists proceeded towards Khejuri. But Nandigram BDO Ashok Sarkar, who was standing guard on the bridge over the Talpatti canal in Tekhali with a police contingent, persuaded the mob not to proceed. 

 In Calcutta, the chief minister took stock of the situation with chief secretary A.K. Deb and home secretary P.R. Ray. 

 Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee told a rally at Esplanade she would consider participating in an all-party meeting if it is convened by governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi.

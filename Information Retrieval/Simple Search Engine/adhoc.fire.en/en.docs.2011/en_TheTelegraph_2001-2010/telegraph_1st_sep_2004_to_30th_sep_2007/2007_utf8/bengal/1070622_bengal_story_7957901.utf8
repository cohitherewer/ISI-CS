 Dad kills girl of two months

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 21: A man strangled to death his two-month-old daughter, angry because his wife had borne him a second girl child.

 Thirty-two-year-old Bokdad Sheikh banged the infants head on the floor after throttling her and finally dumped the body near a pond in the backyard. 

 Police today arrested the daily-wage earner, his mother Angira Bibi, two sisters and brother from a village in Diamond Harbour in South 24-Parganas.

 Sheikh and his 28-year-old wife Hafiza Bibi have a two-year-old daughter. The police said Sheikh often beat up Hafiza for giving birth to girls. 

 Last night, too, he assaulted her after which she left for a relatives house in the same locality with her elder daughter. 

 When she came back around 11 pm, Sheikh told Hafiza he had murdered the girl. 

 Early this morning, Hafiza went to Diamond Harbour police station and reported the matter. During interrogation, Sheikh confessed to the murder.

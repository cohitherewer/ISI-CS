The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 RJ a Prashant fan

 MANDIRA NAYAR 

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: Delhi-based radio jockey Nitin, who has triggered violent protests in Darjeeling with his alleged remarks on Prashant Tamang, says he sent countless SMS votes to ensure his victory. 

 I am myself a great fan of Prashant. I always have and always will continue supporting Prashant and all the budding and talented singers from the north-eastern part of India, he said in a written reply to The Telegraph. 

 If in this particular show, where we were celebrating Prashants victory in Indian Idol, any listener of my show has misinterpreted my intent and felt hurt or insulted, I am extremely sorry and apologetic. I did not intend anything like this at all. 

 One of the highest paid RJs in Delhi, Nitins morning show Ulta Pulta Nitin is a hit. Known for his wisecracks, Nitin was one of the few RJs who was poached by Red FM when it was launched. 

 Red FM maintains that a section of the people have (sic) misinterpreted some of the statements as being insulting. 

 Nitin, the channel says used some humorous phrases in the show with the sole purpose of creating joy and happiness in the morning showwithout referring to any particular community in an insulting manner. 

 In an attempt to douse the fire over his humorous phrases, Nitin apparently went on air and apologised to everyone who have (sic) misinterpreted his remarks. 

 The channel put Prashant on air on September 26. In an excerpt sent to The Telegraph by the channel, he was quoted as saying: There is nothing like this. Its just a misunderstanding I listen to Red FM myself. Nitin has not said anything of this sort. Everything is fine. 

 Case against channel

 Inspector-general (law and order) Raj Kanojia said in Calcutta a case has begun. We have started a case against the radio jockey and a team of officials will be leaving for the channels Delhi office for an inquiry. Those involved will be firmly dealt with.

 Asked about the governments stand, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said: Ive already condemned it... Ive told the home ministry to take up the issue with I amp;B ministry and take legal action against those responsible.

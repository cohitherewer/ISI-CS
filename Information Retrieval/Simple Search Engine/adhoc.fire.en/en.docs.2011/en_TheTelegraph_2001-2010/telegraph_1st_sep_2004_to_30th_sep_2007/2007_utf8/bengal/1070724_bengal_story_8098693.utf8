The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Promise of power relief 

 Calcutta, July 23: There will be no power cuts by Puja, minister Mrinal Banerjee promised the Assembly today.

 The power scenario will improve before Puja (October) and well not have to resort to power cuts, Banerjee said, replying to the debate on the power budget. 

 He said the crisis now is a result of an increase in demand by about 500mw during evenings. 

 Two new units a 210mw unit in Bakreswar and a 300mw one in Sagardighi are scheduled to be running by October. A hydel project in Purulia is also expected to generate about 100mw.

 We expect to sell surplus power to other states with the increased capacity, Banerjee said.

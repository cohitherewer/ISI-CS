The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Alarm for heavy rain rings again

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 18: The Met office today again warned of very heavy rain in south Bengal in the next 48 hours.

 A low pressure, formed in the north Bay of Bengal this morning, intensified into a well marked low pressure in the afternoon, triggering the possibility of torrential rain. A cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) over the Bengal coast has made matters worse.

 Under their combined influence, we expect heavy to very heavy rain (which could exceed 250mm) till Monday afternoon. East and West Midnapore, Bankura, Purulia, Jharkhand and adjoining Orissa are likely to receive the maximum rain, said G.C. Debnath the weather section director at the Alipore Met office.

 A warning had also been issued yesterday, but it only rained 12.3mm in Alipore, 6mm in Dum Dum, 10mm in Diamond Harbour, and 7mm in Canning between 8.30am and 5.30pm. 

 But the low pressure, int- ensifying steadily, could mean trouble, said the weatherman. 

 The government has alerted the coastal districts and asked them to ready relief.

 Panskura, Moyna and Kolaghat in East Midnapore were flooded today after the dam on the Kangshabati in Bankura released 1.5 lakh cusecs. The Keleghai submerged Egra.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Thief caught in bike botch

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 10: A midnight drama unfolded near Charu Market police station in south Calcutta late on Friday night when a criminal was caught red-handed while trying to flee with a motorcycle.

 According to police, Pradip Naskar, in his twenties, scaled the wall of businessman Swarup Pals residence in the Charu Market area around 1 am. Pals motorcycle was parked in the courtyard. Arijit Chatterjee, Pals neighbour, who was studying till late night, noticed Pradip trying to sneak out with the motorcycle through the backdoor of the house and raised an alarm.

 When Pal accosted the criminal, he whipped out a revolver and tried to shoot him from point-blank range but the weapon did not work, said Nisar Ahmed, officer-in-charge of Charu Market police station. Pradip panicked and started fleeing but Pal and some local residents gave him a chase and overpowered him.

 The police reached the spot around 1.25 am. We took Pradip into custody and seized the weapon. He has been remanded in police custody till March 15, an officer said.

 Local residents said they had seen Pradip loitering in the area for the past few days but did not suspect him.

 The place has become unsafe as criminals rule the roost. The area has witnessed several murders and gang-wars in the past couple of years but police remain inactive. Even requests to step up vigil at night have not yielded any results, said Aloke Das, a resident.

 Pradip is said to have been been involved in several cases of snatching and extortion in the Tollygunge and Jadavpur areas and operated with associates Kallu and Munna.

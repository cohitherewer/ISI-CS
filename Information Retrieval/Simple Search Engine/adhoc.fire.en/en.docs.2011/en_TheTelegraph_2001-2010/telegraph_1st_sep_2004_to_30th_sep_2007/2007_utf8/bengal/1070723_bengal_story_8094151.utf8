 Mobile feud leads to death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, July 22: Scolded 

 by her husband for endlessly talking on the mobile phone, 

 a 22-year-old housewife hanged herself last evening.

 Police said the phone had been a cause of tension between Smarajit Biswas and Rupa for some time.

 Smarajit, a weaver, often accused his wife of being too caught up with friends.

 The residents of Shantipur in Nadia, around 70km from Calcutta, were married for five years. 

 The mobile phone was an all-time companion for the childless Rupa. The woman from Kanchrapara in neighbouring North 24-Parganas was in touch with many of her old friends.

 Initially, we didnt even have a landline. I bought the mobile because my parents are old and I wanted to be in touch with my house. But my wife always remained glued to the phone. She held the phone to her ear even while cooking. It often irritated me, said Smarajit, 30. 

 Smarajits partner in his weaving business, Sudip Biswas, said one of the reasons why he bought the phone was to rid her of loneliness.

 Like many women of her age, Rupa often gave missed calls to friends and waited for them to call back. 

 Two days ago, Smarajit asked Rupa not to use the phone so frequently but did not impose a restriction. 

 Smarajit reacted angrily when he returned home last evening and saw his wife on the phone.

 He overheard a male voice on the other end and snatched the phone from Rupa, said Anupam Chakraborty, the officer in charge of Shantipur police station. 

 Humiliated, the woman marched to her bedroom and hanged herself from the ceiling fan. 

 It was Smarajit who saw her hanging and rushed her to Shantipur hospital, where she died this morning, the officer said.

 Father-in-law Anil Biswas, 70, who often felt offended by Rupas mobile phone addiction, today said he was too shocked to speak.

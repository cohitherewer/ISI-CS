The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Army bridge proposal

 OUR BUREAU 

 Jan. 19: An army team today arrived at Chhatarpathar to conduct a survey of the stretch of National Highway-2 that cracked last Tuesday after an explosion at an abandoned coal mine.

 The government sought the armys help to construct a temporary road as vehicular movement has been stopped on the affected part of the Calcutta-Delhi road, about 240 km from Calcutta. A five-member team, comprising an engineer and four jawans, arrived from Panagarh this morning.

 Officials of the Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority said that setting up a kilometre-long bailey bridge over the affected stretch is being considered. The army carried out a survey today. One of the proposals is the bailey bridge. However, a final decision is yet to be taken, said N.S. Nigam, additional district magistrate of Asansol.

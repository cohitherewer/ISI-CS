 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Raiganj, Aug. 23: The North Dinajpur administration called off rescue operations at Domohona, 24 hours after a Bailey bridge collapsed there.

 The family of Phulobala Devi, who fell into the Sudani 40 feet below and died, will be given Rs 50,000 by the government. Seven others had been pulled out of the water. 

 The three students of Rahatpur High Madarsa reported missing by their parents returned home this morning. 

 The bridge is part of National Highway 34, connecting Calcutta with Siliguri and the Northeast.

 Death after in-law threats 

 OUR BUREAU

 Rizwanur Rehman

 Calcutta, Sept. 21: A youth who married the daughter of a prominent businessman against her parents wishes was found dead beside the railway tracks between Dum Dum and Bidhannagar Road.

 The body of 22-year-old Rizwanur Rehman, an English honours graduate from a well-known missionary college in south Calcutta, was covered with injury marks and his head was smashed.

 A case filed by railway police said Rizwanur appeared to have been hit by a train. The post-mortem is scheduled tomorrow.

 Rizwanurs family alleged that the youth had been threatened by his in-laws since his wedding in August and repeatedly asked to divorce his wife. The family had not filed a police complaint on Rizwanurs death till late tonight.

 My brother was also threatened several times by personnel from Karaya police station and senior police officials from Lalbazar. We suspect that there is some foul play in my brothers death, said Rukbanur, Rizwanurs elder brother, at the Tiljala Lane house of the Rehmans.

 Others said two IPS officers had threatened to trump up charges against the youth if he refused to opt for divorce. 

 According to the police, the girls parents had approached them to lodge a complaint of kidnapping against Rizwanur after the couple got married. But we did not register any case because both were consenting adults and had got married legally, said an officer of the Karaya police station. 

 Rizwanur had recently started a computer business. On September 9, the girls parents managed to persuade her to go home with them for a few days, saying that she could return soon, the officer said. 

 However, before this, Rizwanur had sought an NGOs help. The NGO, the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights, had advised him to contact the state human rights commission.

 APDR secretary Sujato Bhadra said the youth was supposed to accompany him to Lalbazar this afternoon. Bhadra spoke to Rizwanur at 10.10am over cellphone. At 10.45, the young mans body was found.

 Efforts to get in touch with the girls family in Salt Lake did not yield any result.

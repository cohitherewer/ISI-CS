The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Insurance nominee air cleared

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 22: The high court today said that nominees for life insurance policies were mere custodians of the claim amounts and that the money would have to be distributed among all legal heirs of the policy-holders.

 Justice Dipankar Dutta directed the Life Insurance Corporation to issue three cheques of equal amounts in favour of the mother, widow and daughter of LIC policy-holder Dilip Hati within eight weeks.

 Dilip was murdered seven years ago in South-24 Parganas Patharpratima. His wife Dipali was the nominee for all the five policies he had in his name.

 According to the Properties Act, a nominee of any policy has the authority to withdraw the claim amount but after receiving the money, he or she is bound to distribute the amount among all the legal heirs of the policy-holder, Justice Dutta said in his judgment.

 A perception exists that only the nominee is entitled to the claim amount.

 When the LIC was about to disburse the amount in favour of Dipali, Dilips mother Abala Hati told the insurance company that her daughter-in law was not willing to give her the share to which she was entitled. When the LIC also decided not to pay her the amount, Abala moved the high court.

 Moving Abalas petition, her lawyer Sanjeeb Banerjee argued: As a legal heir of Dilip, my client (Abala) has the right to claim a portion of the policy amount. Moreover, a nominee does not have the sole right to enjoy the claim amount.

 Dipalis lawyer contended that as nominee for the policy, Dipali had sole right to claim the amount and it was her discretion how she would spend the amount.

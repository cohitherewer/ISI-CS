 Govt to pay 8 per cent for pension fault

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 1: The high court today ordered the government to pay 8 per cent interest to retired teaching and non-teaching employees of state-aided schools whose retirement benefits were held up for no fault of theirs.

 The principal secretary of the finance department is directed to pay 8 per cent interest to teaching and non-teaching staff of government schools who retired but there was delay in disbursement of pension and other statutory dues, Justice Biswanath Somadder said.

 The principal secretary, Samar Ghosh, was also told to identify within a year the officials responsible for the delay. The government will have to realise the interest from these employees, the order said.

 Over 400 schoolteachers and non-teaching employees who retired between 2000 and 2006 had moved court separately, but their cases were clubbed. 

 Another 6,000 teaching and non-teaching staff, who got their benefits long after their retirement but did not approach the court, will also benefit as Justice Somadders verdict would be a precedent for their cases also, said a senior high court lawyer.

 The government counsel appeared happy that the court had only ordered payment of 8 per cent interest. Many high court judges had earlier ordered up to 18 per cent interest for the delay, Tapabrata Chakraborty said.

 The school education department will decide whether to challenge todays order after getting a copy of it.

 An official said the disbursal of pension was delayed in most cases because of the schools faults in maintaining service records.

 Todays judgment was based on a memo issued by the state government on May 26, 1998. In it, the government declared that officials held responsible for delay in disbursing the statutory dues of a retired employee would have to pay the interest, said Sourav Mitra, the lawyer appearing for the retired teachers. 

 He added that the government had earlier decided to pay 5 per cent, but the high court set that aside. In many cases, the court asked the state to pay up to 18 per cent for delay in disbursement of pension.

 The higher interest ordered earlier was mostly in the case of teachers who had not received any pension for years after retirement. 

 An education department official admitted that the government has paid Rs 3 core in the past few years as interest for delayed disbursal of retirement benefits. The memo was issued in 1998, but not a single official has been fined yet.

 The court, however, made it clear that no interest would be paid to teachers or non-te- aching employees who were themselves responsible for the delay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Goons inside locked coach

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, April 4: A hunt for explosives led police to the locked luggage van of a train where four men with smuggled goods worth lakhs were hiding.

 A Railway Protection Force (RPF) squad, which was searching the Sealdah-bound Uttarbanga Express, caught them at Malda station around 12.30 this morning. 

 Parimal Saha of Siliguri, Safiqul Sheikh of Behrampore, and Zahir Sheikh and Moinuddin Sheikh of Beldanga in Murshidabad were holed up in the coach with 1,500 cameras, 5,000 flashlights, 1,000 vacuum flasks, 1,000 binoculars all Chinese-made and pirated CDs, DVDs and cardamom.

 They did not have train tickets. But Parimal had an air ticket to Mumbai.

 An RPF source said a call to Malda from the office of the north Bengal inspector-general prompted the search. The train was believed to be carrying explosives. 

 The instruction to launch the raid came after the train left Siliguri. A special squad of the RPF began the search with two sniffer dogs as soon as the train chugged into Malda around 12.30 am.

 However, when the force reached the luggage van, the personnel found it locked from inside. 

 Not taking chances, the RPF detached the compart-ment from the train and took it out of the platform with the help of another engine. 

 Two fire tenders were also rushed to the spot. But few passengers realised what was going on. 

 The security personnel then surrounded the coach with their guns aiming at it, apprehending the presence of armed extremists.

 But when the door was prised open using gas-cutters, four men flung themselves at the door in an attempt to flee.

 Stationmaster Dilip Chauhan said the train left for Sealdah at 2.45 am. 

 The RPFs security commissioner, Ramshankar Prasad, said they could not have been travelling that way without the connivance of a section of railway employees and RPF personnel.

 An RPF source said the initial alert about the explosives had come from Delhi. 

 We have seized goods worth nearly a crore in the past fortnight, a senior RPF officer said.

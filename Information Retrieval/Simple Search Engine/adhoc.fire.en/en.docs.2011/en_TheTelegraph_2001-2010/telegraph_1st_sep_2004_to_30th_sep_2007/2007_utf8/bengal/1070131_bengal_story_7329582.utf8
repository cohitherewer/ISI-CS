The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Toddler in drain, lips sealed

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Jan. 30: A child who went missing a week ago was fished out of a drain near Ranaghat today with his hands tied behind and lips sealed with sticking plaster. 

 Lakshmichand Shau, barely a year and a half old, went missing from outside his house at Ainstola, about 65 km from Calcutta. 

 He was the fifth and youngest son of Lalmohan, a mason in Pune who rushed home on hearing about the abduction. 

 Sub-divisional police officer Utpal Naskar said: There were no external marks of injury, but he was probably throttled to death and dumped there. 

 Ayurvedic doctor Rathin Debnath spotted the body around 11 this morning while cleaning the drain around his house. I saw something under a concrete slab. When I pushed hard, the body came loose and floated up, he said.

 Drawn by his scream, others came running to the spot. 

 Lakshmichands mother Rama said he had stepped out to play with his siblings but did not return home. She alleged that the police did not take her complaint seriously.

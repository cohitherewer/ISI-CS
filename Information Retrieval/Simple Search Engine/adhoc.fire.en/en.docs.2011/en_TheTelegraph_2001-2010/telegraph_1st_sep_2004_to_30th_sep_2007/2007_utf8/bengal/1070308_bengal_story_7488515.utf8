 HS writer crisis

 MAIN UDDIN CHISTI

 Cooch Behar, March 7: Visually challenged students about to appear for their higher secondary exams are in a spot. 

 They will not be able to employ Class XI students as writers because the juniors exam has coincided with theirs both beginning on March 16.

 According to rules, a visually impaired HS examinee can take the help of a writer from Class X or XI. Understandably, writers from Class XI are preferred over their juniors. 

 Many visually challenged candidates, like Bipin Krishna Ekka of Town High School here, have already registered the names of Class XI students as their writers. If the council doesnt allow us to change our writers, we wont be able to appear for our exams this year.

 However, in Calcutta, D.N. Munshi, a senior official of the HS councils examination department, said: Considering the situation, we are still accepting fresh applications for engaging writers.

 The council could not immediately say how many visually challenged students would be taking the HS exams this year. But an official said the number is quite substantial.

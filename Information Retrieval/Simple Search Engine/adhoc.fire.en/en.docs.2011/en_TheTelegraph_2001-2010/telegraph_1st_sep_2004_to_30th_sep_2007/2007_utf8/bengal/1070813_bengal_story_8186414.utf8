 Civet lives on milk of human kindness

 Cooch Behar, Aug. 12: A Santhal hunter found a mewling palm civet cub under a mango tree in the town and brought it to the tribes temporary settlement near the railway station about a month ago.

 Today, the animal, fondly called Hari, is a resident of Arati Pashis tent. The 35-year-old woman has been dividing her breast milk between the civet and her 18-month-old son.

 One look at the cub and I was worried. It had fallen off a tree and appeared to be about a week old. It struck me that it must have been on its mother milk, so why not breast feed it? Im happy that it has survived, said a proud Arati. 

 The Santhals, a roving group here, go to the villages looking for honey combs and are known to love civet meat. But the man who found Hari was moved by the mewl.

 Many tribes, including Santhals, kill civets for food, though it is less of a practice now, said Animesh Bose, the programme co-ordinator of the Himalayan Nature and Adventure Foundation.

 Palm civets, also called Toddy cats, rest by the day on trees or curled up in holes in their trunks. They feed on small animals, birds and insects.

 Raising the civet is not easy for Arati. I dont lactate much since we barely get a square meal a day. At times it becomes difficult to give a share of my sons milk to Hari. Sometimes I supplement their diets with barley, she said.

 Hari is a constant presence at her tent and sleeps with the family. Aratis husband died a few months ago and she has another son and daughter. 

 It would be easier for the family when Hari is able to find its own food, Arati felt. 

 But the civet is listed under the Wildlife Protection Act and keeping it is illegal. The animal should be handed over to us, divisional forest officer Apurba Sen said.

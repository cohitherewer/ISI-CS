 Three doctors face arrest

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, July 11: Non-bailable arrest warrants have been issued against the deputy superintendent of Behrampore General Hospital and two other doctors for not complying with a court order and ignoring summons.

 Murshidabad district judge Ajit Kumar Das asked police this afternoon to arrest the three and produce them before him within 24 hours. 

 The doctors had been asked by the court to conduct tests on an alleged rape victim to determine her age.

 According to the police, on May 12, Abdur Rezzak, a resident of Jagannathpur village in Hariharpara, had eloped with a teenager. When the police found them after two weeks, the girls father charged Rezzak with kidnapping and raping his minor daughter.

 Rezzak was arrested and sent to jail.

 His lawyer, Abu Bakkar Siddiqui, challenged the girls fathers claim that she was a minor. When the father could not produce her birth certificate, the court asked the police to take her to a hospital and medically deduce her age. 

 On July 3, investigating officer Sudhanshu Sekhar Mondal took the girl to Behrampore General Hospital.

 I approached the doctors with the courts order, but they ignored it and told me to leave. They asked me to return in December. When I went to the deputy superintendent, he supported the doctors. On July 9, I told the court about my experience, Mondal said.

 The court had asked the hospital deputy superintendent, Ananda Mohan Mondal, and medical officers Chaitali Bhattacharya and Kalyan Kumar Ghosh to appear today. But none of them turned up.

 The district chief medical officer of health, Mangobinda Mondal, said there is a standing instruction to all hospital authorities to pay attention to court orders.

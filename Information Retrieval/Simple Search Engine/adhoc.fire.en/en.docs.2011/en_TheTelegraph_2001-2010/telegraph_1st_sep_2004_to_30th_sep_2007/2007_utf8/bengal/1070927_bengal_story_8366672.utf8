The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Once bitten, cops shy of couple

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Sept. 26: Nadia police have shown the door to a wealthy father who insisted that his 19-year-old daughter had been abducted at a time Calcutta police are facing the heat for trying to split a legally married couple. 

 The police traced the boy and girl to a house in Shantipur, about 40km from their homes in Krishnagunj, last evening and found that they were adults and married.

 We told the girls father that the police had no further role to play. We cannot separate them, said Santanu Bose, the officer in charge of Krishnagunj police station.

 First-year BA student Reena Karmakar eloped with school dropout Mridul Sardar, 21, who sells vegetables, on Monday morning.

 The boy from Naghata village in Krishnagunj, 120km from Calcutta, belongs to a scheduled tribe. His father-in-law Jiten is a rich jeweller. 

 Mridul and Reena got their marriage registered in Krishnagar on Monday. 

 The Krishnagunj OC said the registration was genuine. So we informed the girls father that we were helpless.

 Jiten said he had vehemently opposed the marriage. They are tribals and we are kayasthas. Moreover, there is a wide gulf between the economic status of the two families, he said. 

 The girls father withdrew his complaint after the Krishnagunj officer-in-charge convinced him that there was little for the police to do.

 I knew what happened to Rizwanur Rahman (he was found dead in Calcutta). After all, my daughter loved Mridul, said Jiten. 

 Khokon Sardar alleged that the Karmakars had been threatening his son Mridul over the past two years. I was threatened, too. At one point, I thought of driving my son out of the house if he did not sever ties with Reena, Khokon said.

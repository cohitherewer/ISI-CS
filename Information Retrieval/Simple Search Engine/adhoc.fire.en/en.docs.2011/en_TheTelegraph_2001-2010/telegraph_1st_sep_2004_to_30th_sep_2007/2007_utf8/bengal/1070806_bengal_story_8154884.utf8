 Threat drives cop to death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Raiganj, Aug. 5: Threats from his sub-inspector father-in-law that he would slap wife-torture charges against him if he refused to live with his in-laws prompted a policeman to commit suicide this morning.

 Subodh Roy said his son Netai had been driven to his wits end because of the pressure created on him by Ahibhusan Roy, a sub-inspector at Goalpokhar, 80km from here. 

 He wanted my son, a Calcutta police sub-inspector, to live with his family. My son had married Roys daughter in February and the irrational demand started within a week, said Subodh. 

 Netais wife Gopali apparently refused to leave her parents after marriage and continued to live with them at Hemtabad, 20km from here.

 Netai, who worked in the records section at Lalbazar, visited North Dinajpur at least seven times since February. Each time, he went to Hemtabad and pleaded with his wife to stay with us, said Subodh. 

 My son called me from Calcutta recently to say his father-in-law had given him an ultimatum that he either move in with them in August or face charges of torturing his wife. My son said he feared for us that we might all end up in jail, Subodh said.

 This morning, Netai came home from Calcutta by an overnight bus and, according to brother Gouranga, went on mumbling that he would not be able to save his parents from shame and indignity. 

 Netai went to his room to rest after some time. When Subodh wanted to wake him up around 10 so that he could join the family for breakfast, he found him unconscious. 

 We rushed him to the district hospital, where he was pronounced dead. An empty pesticide bottle was found from under the bed.

 He seemed depressed this morning and even hinted that his troubles would be over today, but then I didnt realise what he was trying to imply, said Gouranga, a trader.

 The family called up Roy soon after Netai was pronounced dead, but none of the in-laws came to see him till tonight. Roys mobile phone switched off.

 Weve filed an FIR against Roy and his wife. We are awaiting justice, Gouranga said.

 Goalpokhar police station officer-in-charge Samit Deusa said Roy went to the Islampur court in connection with a case this morning. He called to tell us about his son-in-laws death, Deusa said. 

 Police sources said the quarters in Hemtabad where Roy lives with his wife and daughter was locked.

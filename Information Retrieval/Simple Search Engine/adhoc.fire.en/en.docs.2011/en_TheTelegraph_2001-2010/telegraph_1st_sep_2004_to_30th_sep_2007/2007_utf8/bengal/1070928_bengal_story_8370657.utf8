The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Minority stamp on Jains, 508 madarsas

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 27: The 

 government today allowed minority status to the Jain community 

 and also to 508 madarsas in the state.

 So far, the Muslim, Buddhist, Parsi, Christian and Sikh communities were minorities. Now, the Jains have been included, minority affairs minister Abdus Sattar said. 

 On the madarsas he said: We have given minority status to 508 madarsas so that they can function independently. 

 The new status will allow them to recruit teachers separately, instead of employing those who qualify through the West Bengal School Service Commission. 

 The move is being seen as a sop to the minority community before next years panchayat elections. 

 The madarsas are fully funded by the government and their administration falls under the school education department. A budgetary allocation of Rs 203 crore has been made for them this year. 

 The 508 madarsas that get the minority status would enjoy the benefits under Article 30 of the Constitution, which allows minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. 

 With the minority status, the madarsas will not have to follow the reservation policy while appointing teachers, Sattar said. 

 We have a problem appointing teachers while adhering to the reservation rules. Candidates with knowledge in Arabic and theology are hardly available in the reserved categories, the minister said.

 Now, the madarsas with minority status can choose candidates from the minority community. 

 An official associated with the minority department said a panel headed by Subimal Sen, the vice-chairman of the higher education council, would meet on October 4 to prepare guidelines for the 508 madarsas. 

 Sen will submit a report in two months.

 Sattar also said that 500 madarsas would get state recognition.

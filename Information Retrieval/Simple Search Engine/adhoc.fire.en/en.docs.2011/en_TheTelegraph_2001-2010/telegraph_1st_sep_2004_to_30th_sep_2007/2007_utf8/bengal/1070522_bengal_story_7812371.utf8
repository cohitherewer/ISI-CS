The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, May 21: The government is holding up several proposals for land acquisition for the Dankuni township so that a political consensus can emerge, land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said today.

 His department has not given clearance to any acquisition, except 500 acres for the South 24-Parganas district headquarters at Baruipur, in the past few months. Acquisition for the Jindal and Bhushan Steel projects, however, can go ahead as they dont affect human settle- ments, Mollah said.

 Raiganj: The list of people below poverty line has one Gopal Krishna Gandhi here. No one by the governors name lives in the Raiganj municipality area, though. 

 Howrah: A woman died when a tree fell on her during a Norwester on Monday evening. She was working in the field at Chandumari village.

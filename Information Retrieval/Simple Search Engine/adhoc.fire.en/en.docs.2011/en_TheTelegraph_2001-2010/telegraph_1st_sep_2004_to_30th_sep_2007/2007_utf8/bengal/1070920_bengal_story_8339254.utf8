The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cong nod to Nayachar with rider

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 19: The Congress today gave it in writing to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee that it had no objection to Nayachar if geology and environment experts gave the go-ahead to the chemical hub.

 After a party meeting today, state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said: We are of the opinion that the interests of farmers need to be protected when land is acquired for a project. From that point of view, Nayachar is a suitable place if Geological Survey and environment experts give the green signal.

 The island off Haldia belongs to the government and there is no question of having to acquire land for the project.

 The Congress had attended the September 3 all-party meeting to discuss the hub and promised to let the government know its stand soon.

 Bhattacharya today requested the chief minister to clarify whether the government had told Delhi it had dropped plans to set up a special economic zone in Nandigram and was scouting for a new site.

 The party lauded the government for getting Indian Oil Corporation as an anchor investor in the proposed petroleum, chemicals and petrochemicals investment region. The public sector should be preferred if further investment is necessary, the party chief said.

 Asked if he was training guns on the Salim Group, expected to be an anchor developer, he said: We do not want to name anyone. The selection should be transparent.

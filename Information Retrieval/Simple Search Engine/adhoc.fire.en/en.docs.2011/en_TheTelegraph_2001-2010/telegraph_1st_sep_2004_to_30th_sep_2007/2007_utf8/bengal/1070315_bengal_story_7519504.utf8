Calcutta, March 14: The uneasy truce among the Left Front partners over the governments land-for-industry policy suffered a big jolt today as the RSP, CPI and the Forward Bloc strongly condemned the police firing in Nandigram and blamed the CPM for the bloodbath.

 Left Front chairman and CPM state secretary Biman Bose has called an emergency meeting of the front tomorrow following the demands made by the three allies who have decided to speak up in unison at the meeting, virtually as a front within the front.

 Accusing the CPM and the government of running a one-party rule, the allies complained that the police action was the blackest spot on the Left rule and demanded immediate withdrawal of police from Nandigram.

 Threatening that the CPM would have to face the consequences if it continues to take decisions without consulting allies, the leaders of the RSP, CPI and the Forward Bloc went into a huddle several times during the day to decide their course of action. CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan flew down to the city today.

 Some leaders even tinkered with the threat to step down from the cabinet and the issue was raised in the RSP secretariat meeting. The allies decided to record their resentment in the Assembly. 

 CPI veteran and state water resources minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya accused the chief minister of ordering the crackdown, violating the agreement among allies. 

 I am shocked by such wanton killing of men and women by the police. The core committee of the state cabinet had decided that allies would speak in the same tune during the Assembly session. But we were kept in the dark about todays action. It will have an adverse impact on Left unity.

 RSP state secretary Debabrata Banerjee said: Its barbaric, inhuman. CPM is running a one-party rule and the allies were not consulted at all. We want immediate withdrawal of police and political efforts to revive normality.

 RSP veteran and PWD minister Kshiti Goswami alleged that armed CPM cadres joined the police today. 

 We have to think about the future of Left unity if the CPM continues to run the state with its hidden agenda and the gap between the chief ministers words and deeds widens.

 Forward Bloc state secretary Asoke Ghosh also blamed police for opening fire indiscriminately and felt that the government should have shown more patience to bring normality in Nandigram instead of police firing.

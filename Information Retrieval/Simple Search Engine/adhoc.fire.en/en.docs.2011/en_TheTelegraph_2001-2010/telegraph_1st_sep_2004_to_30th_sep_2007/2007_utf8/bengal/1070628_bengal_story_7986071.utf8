 Beldanga, June 27: A circus on a school compound. Sounds fun? Not to the students of Kashimbazar Gobindosundari Vidyapith, who have to concentrate on their books while crowds shout their way to watch animals and clowns every day.

 A circus group has taken over the compound of the school in Murshidabads Beldanga, 180 km from Calcutta, for the past 20 days.

 Students, guardians and residents of the area have lodged complaints with the district administration, alleging that headmaster Sushanta Khan had allowed the group on the school premises without informing them or the managing committee.

 It becomes impossible for us to concentrate on our studies after noon with loudspeakers blaring and people coming to see the first show, which starts at 1 pm. We can hardly hear what our teachers say in class, said Mohammed Sohail, a Class X student.

 The circus tents are barely 10 metres from the school.

 District magistrate Subir Bhadra has sought an explanation from the headmaster.

 Rakibul Islam, a member of the schools managing committee, has written to the district inspector of schools, who has ordered an inquiry. 

 The headmaster claimed the move would benefit the school, but did not say how.

 Rajeeb Rai, the manager of the circus group, said the shows would not stop. We have paid the school a hefty amount as rent. We have also received permission from the subdivisional officer, fire brigade and police.

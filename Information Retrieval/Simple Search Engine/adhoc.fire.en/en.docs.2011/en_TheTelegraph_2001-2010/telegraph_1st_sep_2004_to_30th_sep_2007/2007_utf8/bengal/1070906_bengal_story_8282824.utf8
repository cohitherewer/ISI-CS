 Calcutta, Sept. 5: The bodies of seven pilgrims from Nadia and Murshidabad killed in a crash near Hardwar on Tuesday were flown to Calcutta this afternoon.

 The toll, six yesterday, rose when Mayarani Mondal, 50, succumbed to injuries in a Uttarakhand hospital. 

 All the bodies were cremated tonight. 

 Five injured passengers of the bus from Bengal that hit a stationary tanker, tumbled and rammed into a truck on the way from Nainital arrived by the same flight. 

 There were 50 people in the bus. The other survivors are on their way back.

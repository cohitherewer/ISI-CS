 Train torment leader held

Krishnagar, March 28: An employee of a government hospital in Calcutta was arrested today for being part of the gang of daily passengers who tormented a priest after he refused to vacate his train seat to make space for their card game.

 Lalu Nath, 45, a resident of E Block at Taherpur in Nadia, about 70 km from Calcutta, was arrested this morning during a massive operation launched by the railway police against daily passengers, who are often accused of harassing other commuters on local trains.

 Nath was taken into custody within minutes of boarding the Sealdah-bound train around 6.20 am today.

 Father Dilip Mondal, who teaches English in the Don Bosco School, Krishnagar, was slapped, hit on the hair, held by the collar and abused on the same train on Saturday. The daily passengers tried to drag him out of window seat when he refused to leave it for them to play cards comfortably and smoke. They pulled his hair and ripped off his cassock.

 We recognised Lalu, a group D staff member of SSKM Hospital, from the description provided by Fr Mondal, a Government Railway Police officer said.

 This morning, police personnel fanned out to various stations between Krishnagar and Birnagar in search of the rogue passengers. They picked up five persons who matched the fathers descriptions. 

 Nath was recognised by his gold necklace and wristwatch with a golden strap. 

 Utpal Biswas, the officer-in-charge of the Krishnagar GRP, said the police dragged Nath and four others out of the train and brought them to his office. 

 Father Mondal identified Nath as one of his assailants but failed to recognise the rest. Im sure he led the attack. He held me by the throat and slapped me. The others followed his instructions, he said.

 Lalu Nath was produced in court today. He has been remanded in five days police custody, said Biswas.

 The railway police superintendent for the Sealdah division, Barun Mullick, said he has ordered the Krishnagar force to intensify raids against rogue passengers. Well definitely get hold of all the members of Naths gang, he added.

 Asansol July 9: A six-year-old going to school with his brother was crushed under the wheels of a minibus trying to overtake another on the same route in Burnpur town this morning.

 As the bus hit IISCO employee Vijay Prasads motorcycle, his older son Sumit fell on one side and Akash under the wheels, which smashed his little head.

 A helmet would have possibly proved feeble under the weight of a bus, but still none of the three was wearing one.

 Vijay and Sumit, 12, have been admitted to the IISCO Steel Plant Hospital.

 The school is less than a kilometre from where the accident occurred.

 A mob set fire to two buses and fought police when they tried to shoo them away. 

 Residents blocked the Asansol-Burnpur Road for over three hours and the police had to wield the baton and burst tear gas shells to bring the situation under control around 10.30 am.

 Near the Asansol court, Vijay was suddenly caught between the two mini buses. One of them, travelling at a break-neck speed, knocked down the motorcycle, Asansol additional superintendent of police Bastav Baidya said.

 Vijays hands were fractured. Sumit suffered bruises all over his body.

 We saw the two buses racing against each other. Then we saw the motorcycle going down. The little boy was sucked in under the rear wheels. It was a horrible sight... his head was crushed, said Debasish Das, a betel shop owner.

 After the accident, Vijay apparently tried to get back to his feet. He caught a glimpse of Akash and fainted. 

 Sumit, a Class VI student, kept losing his consciousness through the day. 

 The driver fled, leaving the killer bus behind. The mob stopped another bus coming from the opposite direction, ordered the passengers out and set both buses on fire. The driver and the conductor of the second bus, who had nothing to do with the accident, were beaten up. Brickbats hurled by the mob injured three policemen. 

 The death might just help discipline traffic in the town, about 250 km from Calcutta. 

 We will deploy traffic guards on the road from tomorrow, said subdivisional officer A.P. Roy.

 Corpse in water plant

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Howrah, Sept. 7: The decomposed body of a man was found tonight in the main reservoir of a treatment plant that supplies drinking water to nearly ninety per cent of the wards in Howrah Municipal Corporation.

 Supply from the Padmapukur plant has been stopped till at least noon tomorrow.

 Around 30 million gall- ons of water is supplied from the plant a day to 44 of the 50 wards in the corporation.

 The discovery of the body sparked outrage with people alleging they had been supplied with contaminated water. 

 Police baton-charged a crowd that laid siege to the plant.

 A police officer said the condition of the body suggested that it could have been lying inside the reservoir for at least two days. 

 An inquiry has been started. The water has been drained out of the reservoir. We hope to purify the reservoir by Sunday, said Khalil Ahmed, the district magistrate of Howrah.

 The body was found around 9.40pm by workers carrying out maintenance, an official said. 

 Some residents, however, alleged that the corporation was trying to remove the body late at night to keep suspected contamination under wraps.

 We were getting a fetid smell since this evening. Suddenly, we saw some corporation workers removing the body, Sankar Chaudhury, a resident, said.

 They were trying to hush up the matter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Monk held on Bangkok way

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 15: A Bangladeshi in the disguise of a Buddhist monk and carrying a fake Indian passport tried in vain to hoodwink immigration officials at Calcutta airport this morning. 

 Piyush Barua, 27, of Chittagong was about to board a Jet Airways flight to Bangkok with a passport in the name of Shyamal Barua. 

 He reached Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport around 10 am, two hours before the flights departure.

 After checking in, Barua, in a resplendent red-and-yellow attire, went for immigration clearance. His papers raised the suspicion of the official posted there. 

 Barua claimed he was an Assamese and a monk, an official said. 

 He was detained for questioning, during which he could not follow queries in Assamese. 

 After several hours of grilling, the man broke down and admitted to travelling with fake documents. Barua told officials that he had forged his documents to get the passport. 

 After obtaining forged documents of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education and the Assam bo-ard, he prepared the rubber stamp of a senior doctor attached to the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital to attest the papers.

 Barua obtained the passport from Guwahati on the basis of these documents. 

 He has been coming to Guwahati from Chittagong illegally crossing the border for the past 10 years, the official said. The city was quite familiar to him and he used his contacts there to get the fake passport, the official added.

 This time, he had crossed the border and entered India at Cooch Behar and then travelled to Calcutta. 

 Barua told officials that his parents had died recently and he was planning to go to Bangkok for a better living. 

 The fake passport, two cellphone SIM cards and the rubber stamp have been found. 

 Barua was handed over to the airport police station in the evening.

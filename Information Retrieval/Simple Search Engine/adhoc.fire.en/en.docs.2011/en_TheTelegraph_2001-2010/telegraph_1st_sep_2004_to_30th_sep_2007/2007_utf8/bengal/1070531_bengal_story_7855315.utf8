The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Untouched pockets of influence

 OUR BUREAU

 After Wednesdays municipal and panchayat poll results, the areas of political influence remained pretty much what they had been before the land battles started in Bengal. 

 Mamatas challenge remained confined to Panskura, re-confirming south Bengal as her battle zone. Dhupguri in north Bengal stayed, as before, too far for her and her Singur-Nandigram campaign made little difference to existing political equations there. 

 Even in Nalhati, in the central district of Birbhum, Trinamul drew a blank. It had been and continued to be Congress territory. The same was the case with the Coopers Camp municipality in Nadia. Although in south Bengal, it defied Mamatas appeals and stayed with the Congress. 

 The status quo in the civic bodies, except in Panskura, does not reveal the complete picture, though. At Durgapur, for instance, the Lefts big win was never in question. But the drop in the CPMs share of votes 55 per cent from 65 in 2002 could rattle the party. 

 Even assuming that the incumbent losing some votes is a general trend in elections, it looked likely that Mamatas land wars had at least a marginal effect in other suburban areas. But once again, the land-industrialisation campaigns did not seem to weigh a lot more than local issues that usually dominate civic and panchayat polls. 

 The panchayats, however, reaffirmed themselves as the CPMs strongest base. Of a total of 390 gram panchayat seats, for which the results were available, the CPM had bagged 215, far ahead of Trinamuls 63 and the Congresss 58. Of 94 panchayat samiti seats, the CPM had 52, Trinamul 13 and the Congress eight. 

 In the zilla parishads, the CPM had 18 of the 24 seats, while Trinamul got two and the Congress one. 

 Mamata attributed the panchayat results to CPMs str- ong-arm tactics, because of which her party could not put up candidates for 200-odd seats. We were also preoccupied with the Singur-Nandigram movement and couldnt concentrate on the polls, she said.

 Her reactions to the results had a veiled accusation at the Congress, which allegedly queered her pitch in many places. No party should treat another party as untouchable or non-secular. The onus for forging the anti-CPM alliance is also on the party that is being kept alive at the Centre by the CPM. 

 If it was the same old mahajot that she depended on defeating the CPM, even she had not anticipated her Singur-Nandigram campaigns to change electoral politics in Bengal much. The results proved her right.

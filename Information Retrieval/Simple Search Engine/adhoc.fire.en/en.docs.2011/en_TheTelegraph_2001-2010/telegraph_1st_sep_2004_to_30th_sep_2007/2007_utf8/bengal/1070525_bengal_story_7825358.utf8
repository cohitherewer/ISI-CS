 Ragging drives out student

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, May 24: A student of a private engineering college in Bankura today left after he was ragged by seniors, a week after the menace drove away another boy from Suri.

 Soumya Roy, a first-year electronic engineering student of Mallabhum Technical Institute in Bishnupur town, about 230 km from Calcutta, had been kept confined in a hostel room since Monday and forced to take drugs like marijuana and charas.

 Last week, a first-year civil engineering student had left Suri Polytechnic College after six seniors scalded him with cigarette butts and banged his head against a wall.

 Soumya today said he did not want to study in the college anymore. I found myself helpless and spent four sleepless nights.

 Soumyas father Shymalendu Roy, a businessman, took him home to New Barrackpore this morning after he was told about his sons plight by one of his classmates.

 Roy later lodged a complaint with the Bishnupur sub-divisional officer, Ajoy Kumar Ghosh.

 Ghosh said a probe has been started and sought an explanation from the institute authorities. 

 The Supreme Court had recently put the onus of action against ragging on colleges. Otherwise, it had said, their funds tap could be shut.

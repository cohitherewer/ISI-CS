The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CPM not ashamed for firing in Nandigram

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Benoy Konar: Leading the charge

 Calcutta, July 31: The CPM will take Nandigram to Khammam, only to deny any parallel between the police firing and the death of farmers in Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. 

 The state unit of the party today also made it clear that it was not ashamed about the Nandigram firing and didnt feel the need to review the mistakes made, as asked by the CPM central committee.

 Well explain the Nandigram situation to the people of Andhra and the difference between the police action in the two states. We are not at all ashamed of the Nandigram firing, CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar said today. 

 The partys central committee had admitted some mistakes in the handling of the affair as stated by the chief minister in April and asked the Bengal unit to examine the circumstances and the handling of matters that led to the police action on March 14.

 Konar said: We may have reason for self-criticism. We failed to convince people that their fear about land acquisition was misplaced. But we have not reviewed the March 14 firing as there was hardly anything to review.

 A six-member CPM-CPI team will visit Khammam, where six CPM supporters were killed in police firing during an agitation demanding land reforms. The party would pay Rs 2 lakh to the victims families. 

 Konar, who would lead the team to Andhra, described the Congress governments decision to pay compensation to the victims families and transfer police officers involved in the firing as the partys compulsion to run the show in Delhi. 

 In Bengal, the CPM has refused to pay any compensation and has not acted against any policeman. It will be like paying compensation to a riotous mob, Konar said. 

 Chemical hub

 The CPM wants the government to consult experts to ensure environmental safety in the proposed chemical hub. 

 But unlike its allies, or the Opposition, the party opposes the demand to set up an expert committee and wait for its clearance before moving ahead. 

 Weve sent a letter stating our stand in response to the chief ministers note seeking the opinion of all political parties. Weve urged the govern-ment to take care of the concerns over the impact on environment and ensure preventive measures, Konar said.

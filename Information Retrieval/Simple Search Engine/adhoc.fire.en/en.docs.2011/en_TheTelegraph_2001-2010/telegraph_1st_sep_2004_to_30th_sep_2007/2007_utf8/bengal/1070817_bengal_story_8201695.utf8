 Canal peril for Sector V 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 16: The high water level in the Kestopur canal could be one of the reasons why Sector V was flooded during Mondays downpour, the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (Nita), which runs the IT zone, said today. 

 At their board meeting, Nita officials also discussed the dismal condition of roads and sewerage in the area and how it could be improved. Representatives of IT firms that have offices in the Salt Lake address were present.

 Senior advisers of the housing and urban development departments are scheduled to meet in the next few days and discuss what to do about the Kestopur canal. The high water level in the canal is necessary for the ferry service that was restarted in August.

 It is a major drainage canal for Salt Lake. When Sector V gets flooded, it will not be possible to pump out water from the IT hub into the canal as it is already full, a Nita official said.

 However, advisers of Hidco, the housing department body that oversees the maintenance of the Kestopur canal, alleged that Nita had not used enough pumps to keep Sector V free of waterlogging. 

 Roads in Sector V will be repaired after Durga Puja, Anup Matilal, the Nita CEO, said. Work on sewerage treatment and water supply in Sector V will be taken up by Jusco, a Tata subsidiary, in November after it signs a formal agreement with Nita, he added.

 But before that, we have decided to take stern action against a few companies who have been dumping construction material on Sector V roads and choking gully-pits while building their complexes, Matilal said.

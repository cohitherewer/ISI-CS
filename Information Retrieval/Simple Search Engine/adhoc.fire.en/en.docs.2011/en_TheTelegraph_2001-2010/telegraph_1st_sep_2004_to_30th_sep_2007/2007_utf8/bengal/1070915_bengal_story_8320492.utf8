 Election frenzy over idol

 Siliguri wore the look of a city in election-time buntings, festoons and rallies with Vote for placards dotting every road.

 Only this would be a vote for a singing champ.

 The final round of the text-message poll for Indian Idol started on Friday evening after Prashant Tamang and Amit Paul performed one last time.

 Prashant is the local hero, being from Darjeeling. But Amit, too, has a Siliguri connection, having spent his childhood here before shifting to Shillong. 

 BSNL has increased its capacity to handle text messages by three times, said M.K. Nandi, its Siliguri subdivisional engineer. In addition, all 47 telephone exchanges in the hills have been put on alert. Employees have been deputed with necessary spares to avoid any problem.

 A rally with 65 motorcycles and 10 cars went to the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company office earlier in the day to request for uninterrupted power supply during the evening show.

 We have also requested BSNL and other cellphone service providers to keep their lines clear so that people can vote as much as they want, a rallyist said.

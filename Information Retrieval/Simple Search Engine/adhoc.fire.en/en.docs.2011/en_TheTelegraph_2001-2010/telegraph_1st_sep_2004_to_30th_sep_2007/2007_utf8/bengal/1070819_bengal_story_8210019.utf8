 Aug. 18: A teenager training to be an airhostess was allegedly kidnapped by two middle-aged women from the Park Street-Russel Street intersection this morning.

 Police said Howrah girl Nishi Basant was made unconscious and whisked away.

 She regained consciousness at Kolaghat and found herself in an abandoned Maruti van on a national highway, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Javed Shamim. 

 A kidnapping case has been started on the basis of a complaint lodged by Nishis father Rajendra Basant, who owns a lathe factory in Howrahs Pilkhana area.

 Nishi left home early in the morning to attend classes as usual. She took an autorickshaw to Howrah station and a Park Street-bound bus from there. Around 7.45am, when she was walking towards her Camac Street institute, two middle-aged women came up from behind and pressed something on her nostrils. She became conscious again 60km from Calcutta, Shamim said.

 Mother Sweety said Nishi got out of the grey van and made it to a phone booth, from where she tried to call her father around 11am. But she cou-ldnt get through and rang up a friend, Sarfaraz. He called our family friend, Nadeem Ahmed, who got in touch with my husband.

 The father said the phone booth owner called Kolaghat police. The police called me and I rushed to Kolaghat. 

 Nishi had also called her institute when she could not get through to her father. We immediately called her house. We called back again and her father said he was on his way to (East) Midnapore, said Sandip Sarkar, the Frankfinn centre head.

 Rajendra came to the Park Street police station with his daughter this evening to lodge the complaint.

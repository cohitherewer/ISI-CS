 Neglect charge on surgeon

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 27: A complaint of medical negligence was today registered against a nephrologist of a private nursing home by the relatives of a 38-year-old man whose condition deteriorated after a kidney transplant.

 Manik Ganguly, a resident of Hooghly, had been suffering from chronic renal failure for around three years and had undergone surgery at the nursing home on July 18, his brother-in-law Rupankar Ghosal said.

 Nephrologist Ranjan Sarkar was attending to him. The day after the transplant, we were told that Manik had been put on ventilation. Now the doctor is keeping us in the dark and our patient is not getting proper medical attention. After the surgery, the doctors also told us that the kidney they put into my brother-in-law was not of good quality, Ghosal alleged. 

 We have received a complaint against a doctor in this regard, said an official of Alipore police station.

 Sarkar said Ganguly had been well taken care of and the entire business was unfortunate. 

 Before the treatment, the donor was thoroughly checked... so the allegation that the transplanted kidney was not good is baseless, he said.

 Ganguly suffered a respiratory arrest that forced us to put him on ventilation to save his life. We did not get time to consult the relatives. But they were informed later.

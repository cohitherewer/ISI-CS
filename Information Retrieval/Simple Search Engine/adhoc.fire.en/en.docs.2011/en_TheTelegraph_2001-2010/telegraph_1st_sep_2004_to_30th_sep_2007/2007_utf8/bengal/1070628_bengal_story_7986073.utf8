The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Panskura winning formula in Haldia

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mamata: Charged up

 Tamluk, June 27: Inspired by their success in the Panskura civic elections, Opposition parties, barring the BJP, have formed an unofficial grand alliance in the Haldia municipality, which is going to polls on July 22.

 The Telegraph had reported on Monday that the Trinamul Congress, the Congress and other like-minded parties were readying for a pre-poll pact to prevent a split in anti-Left votes in Haldia.

 The Opposition parties today decide to join hands in 25 of the 26 seats being contested. In the 2002 elections, the number of seats was 25 and the Left Front had got all of them.

 But the Panskura municipality slipped from the CPMs grip this year as the Opposition bagged 10 of 17 seats in the polls, held soon after the Nandigram police firing stained the governments image. 

 After the results, Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee had given the green signal to district party leaders to launch efforts to form a grand alliance in Haldia. Our leader saw reason in our arguments in favour of a mahajot, Trinamul MLA Sisir Adhikary said.

 The CPM leadership, however, brushed off suggestions of a threat from the Opposition, saying Panskura would not be repeated in Haldia.

 We lost in Panskura because of various reasons. Our vote share was reduced by 10 per cent and there were other organisational issues, state secretariat member Benoy Konar said. 

 Today the last date for filing nominations the Trinamul, Congress and the Jamait Ulema-i-Hind fielded candidates in 18, six and two seats, respectively. 

 The BJP has decided to contest in one ward against the Trinamul after its request for a seat was turned down.

 The BJP was given a seat for the Panskura civic elections as it had a presence there. In Haldia, the lotus symbol is nowhere to be seen. So how will we allot it seats? Haldias Trinamul leader Debaprasad Mondal asked.

 In Panskura, the BJP was part of the Opposition alliance but it could not win the lone seat it contested.

 District BJP secretary Sukumar Das countered the Trinamuls argument, saying his party had contested 17 seats in the last election and that was enough proof of its existence in Haldia. 

 After contesting 17 seats in the 2002 polls, how can people raise questions about our organisational presence? This time, we are contesting only one seat with a view to strengthening the anti-CPM front. If the Trinamul withdraws its candidate from the ward where we have fielded our nominee, the fight with CPM would be like that in Panskura, Das said.

 The Party for Democratic Socialism, part of the Trinamul-sponsored Krishi Jomi Raksha Committee, is also contesting two seats on its own after the Trinamul refused to allot it a single seat.

 The district Congress, however, refused to describe the one-on-one contest as the outcome of an unofficial mahajot. 

 What we have created is not a front. It is a seat adjustment deal that we have struck to pay respect to the wishes of the people of Haldia, district Congress president Sailaja Das said.

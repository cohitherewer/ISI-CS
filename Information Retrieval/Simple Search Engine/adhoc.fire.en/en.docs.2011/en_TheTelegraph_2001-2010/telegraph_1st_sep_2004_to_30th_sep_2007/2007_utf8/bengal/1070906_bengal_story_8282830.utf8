 Naked girl in Malda hospital

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, Sept. 5: A 16-year-old girl, found naked in the district hospital here, was made to lie in that state for hours in a verandah today. 

 A nurse saw her behind the morgue around 9am. She was lying in a foetal position on a patch covered with hospital waste. 

 It was two more hours before the girl was admitted to the hospital, where she lay without any treatment till late this evening. Police, who came at 6pm, are yet to confirm if she had been raped. 

 Hospital superintendent Maniklal Das refused to speak when asked why the teenager, who is in a state of delirium and has been complaining of a severe headache in Hindi, had not been given a set of clothes or attended by doctors for so long. 

 The nurses protested. We want to know why she was made to lie naked on a cot in the veranda of the isolation ward, said Molly Chaki, the district secretary of the nurses association.

 District magistrate Chittaranjan Das later said the district police chief would conduct a thorough probe.

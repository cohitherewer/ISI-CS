The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cong asks Buddha for update

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 20: Opposition leaders today confronted chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee when he visited the Assembly after a gap of four days and asked him to make a statement on the latest update on Nandigram.

 Buddhadeb babu should state what action his government has initiated to restore peace in Nandigram. Why has he been staying away from the House for the past four days? What is the latest body count? Were armed CPM cadre involved? Congress legislature party leader Manas Bhunia asked in the Assembly.

 Bhattacharjee, who was talking to CPI minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya and Forward Bloc minister Naren De, left the House soon after without a word on Nandigram.

 Bhunia also wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh requesting him to ensure liberty to the CBI team probing the Nandigram firing.

 There was chaos in the House for the second consecutive day as Trinamul Congress MLAs disrupted question hour and trooped to the well demanding the chief minister resignation and arrest.

 A five-member Congress delegation from Kerala, which visited Nandigram today, also demanded the chief ministers resignation. 

 Police killed innocent villagers by resorting to indiscriminate firing. So the chief minister should step down owning moral responsibility, Kerala PCC president Ramesh Chennithala said.

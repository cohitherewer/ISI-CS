 Trinamul rubbishes govt report

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 3: The Trinamul Congress today said it would come out with a list of those whose land has been forcibly acquired for the Tata Motors factory in Singur if the government fails to do so in the next 72 hours.

 The government had yesterday released a status report, saying many of the plots Mamata Banerjee claims were forcibly acquired are not part of the land fenced off for the Tata project. 

 It also said that of the plots on the Trinamul list, around 350 had not been acquired at all. 

 Trinamul MLA Partha Chatterjee, the leader of Opposition in the Assembly, dismissed the report saying it did not address the partys complaints. The report is contradictory to the letter written by the chief minister to Mamata on December 20, when she was on hunger strike, he said.

 According to the Trinamul leader, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had in his letter said that the government had not acquired a single plot from unwilling farmers.

 Land price on Jindal talks table today

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 28: The Jindals will hold a final round of talks with the government tomorrow to reduce the price of land for their steel project at Salboni in West Midnapore.

 The group is not happy with the price being quoted for the 4,000 acres that it intends to acquire from the government. It has asked for a rate similar to that offered to the Tatas for their Singur project. 

 All aspects of the land acquisition were worked out barring the price during a meeting that group director (business development) Arunay Kumar held with commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen, land reforms commissioner P.K. Agarwal and West Midnapore district magistrate B.P Barat at the Writers Buildings today.

 The groups officials today told us that the price we have quoted for the government land is too high. They want a concession since they are purchasing a large tract, a senior official in the land and land reforms department said.

 The government has asked for Rs 1.9 lakh an acre for the 4,000 acres, taking the price of the land to around Rs 75 crore. 

 The Jindals will buy another 500 acres directly from farmers, at Rs 3 lakh an acre.

 The group justifies the higher price for farmers, saying that the deal is for fertile agricultural land, the official said. 

 The governments land is fallow.

 Of the 4,000 acres earmarked for the Jindals, around 500 had been allotted to Hind Industries but was taken away after it failed to set up a meat processing plant. The government had charged Hind Rs 1 lakh an acre last year. With that rate in mind, the Jindals are asking why they should shell out Rs 1.9 lakh an acre.

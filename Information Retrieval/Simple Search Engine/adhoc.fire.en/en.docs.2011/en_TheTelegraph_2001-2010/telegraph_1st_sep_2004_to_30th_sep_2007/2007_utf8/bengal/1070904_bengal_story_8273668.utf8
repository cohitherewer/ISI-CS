The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Teacher with heart of gold

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Sept. 3: Residents 

 of a Nadia village have shut down a primary school to protest 

 against the transfer of a much-admired teacher. 

 The primary school council transferred Apurba Majumdar from Krishnapally Primary School last month.

 When the villagers, mostly parents of the schools 250-odd students, came to know of the decision last week, they held a meeting and decided to resist the move.

 Some 500 residents of the Shantipur village, 70km from Calcutta, submitted a memorandum to headmistress Manju Ghosh on Thursday opposing the transfer. 

 When Ghosh pleaded her inability to fight their case with the district school administration, the villagers closed down the school. 

 Well remove the lock only after the transfer is withdrawn, said Gour Biswas, a marginal farmer whose son is in Class I. 

 He never beat children. If ever a student was absent, Apurbababu went to the childs house to find whether the student was sick. He had a heart of gold, Biswas added. 

 Swapan Kundu, the father of a Class II student, said Majumdar also takes extra classes for slow learners. 

 Attendance has improved by leaps and bounds since Apurbababu came here three years ago, said a guardian. 

 When Majumdar, now 43, joined the school, it had only around 150 students. 

 He travels 10km to work from his house in Phulia without a miss.

 A teacher for 19 years, Majumdar would be the headmaster in his new school. I have no choice but to abide by the councils decision, he said. 

 A primary school teacher is not supposed to be in a school for more than three years. This is the rule. I have no power to influence the councils decision, the headmistress said. 

 District school council chairman Bibhash Biswas has asked the local school sub-inspector to convince the guardians. Well try to make them understand that the transfer is mandatory. Otherwise, well have to take administrations help to reopen the school, said Biswas. 

 Asked what he would do if the villagers did not relent, an angry Biswas said: Well close down the school if the people dont want it there.

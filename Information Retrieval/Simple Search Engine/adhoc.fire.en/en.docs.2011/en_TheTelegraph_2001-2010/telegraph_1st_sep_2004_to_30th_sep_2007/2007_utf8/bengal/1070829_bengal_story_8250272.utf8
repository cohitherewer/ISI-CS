The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Consensus first on Salim SEZ 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 28: The governments SEZ agreement with the Salim Group hinges on political consensus and the deal would have to be reworked if there is any change of plan, commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said today.

 The Salim Group had applied for approval of two SEZs a 10,000-acre chemical hub in Nandigram and a 12,500-acre multi-product SEZ in Haldia. But with Nandigram being ruled out, the state is finding it tough to squeeze in the two projects in Haldia.

 The second SEZ is doubtful, given that were already hard pressed for land for the chemical hub. I dont know what final shape the whole thing will take. It all depends on whether there is a political consensus, Sen said.

 The investors have been patient with us, Sen said. They have told us that they will go ahead with the project when we allot the land. It would take around a year to get the Centres nod for the project.

 The Centre had granted in- principle approval to the chemical hub on 10,000 acres. If the size is revised, the Salim pact has to be reopened, Sen said earlier.

 The hub will be part of a larger Petroleum Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Region, for which Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat have already applied to the Centre. Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Orissa are likely to apply next.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Green scan on ship

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, July 26: The Ganga pollution monitoring committee will assess the damage caused by the fly ash-laden barge lying in the depths of the Hooghly.

 It is a very serious incident and some of the committee members will visit the area tomorrow to take stock of the situation, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the convener of the high-court appointed committee.

 The department of environment had last evening directed the state pollution control board to collect samples of the water from the point where the ship sank near Budge Budge on Tuesday. We carried out a preliminary survey yesterday and detailed sampling is continuing today, said Debal Roy, a secretary of the board.

 A three-storey-tall lump of solidified fly ash is now lying submerged. The team of engineers and divers working to get the ship out of the water has not made much headway in the last 24 hours.

 The divers were sent under water to study how the ship is positioned and how strong the layer of fly ash is. Yesterdays efforts were a trial run of the procedure to get the barge out of water. Now we are planning things in detail so that nothing goes wrong and we can complete the operation at the earliest, a Calcutta Port Trust official said.

 The CESC, from whose plants the Bangladeshi cargo ship was ferrying the fly ash, expressed concern, but said the material has not been listed as hazardous by the Union ministry of environment and forests. We go by the guidelines of the ministry, said Sanjay Chakraborty, the chief general manager (generation).

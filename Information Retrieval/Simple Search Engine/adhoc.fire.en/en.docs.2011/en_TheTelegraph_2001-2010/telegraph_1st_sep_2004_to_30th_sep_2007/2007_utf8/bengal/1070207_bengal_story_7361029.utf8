 Ranchi, Feb. 6: A man from Malda was caught in the net cast by Jharkhand police to fish out an international fake currency racket 

 Twenty-two-year-old Sadhan Mandal was paraded in front of the media along with Ainul, 40, from Ranchi, this evening. 

 Mandal claimed that the fake notes were printed in Pakistan and sent to India via Dhaka. Agents based in Malda, he claimed, then fanned out across India to sell them.

 Mandal bought the fake notes paying 44 per cent of the face value. He would have sold them at a minimum of 50 per cent. Only Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were traded.

 Following a tip-off, the police raided a hotel on Station Road here and picked up 10 people. 

 Over Rs 3.5 lakh in fake currency and Rs 50,000 in valid notes were found on them, senior superintendent of police, Ranchi, Naresh Prasad Singh said.

 Mandal claimed to have studied up to Class X. Till a year ago, he cultivated a small family plot and rolled beedis. 

 But trading in fake notes turned out to be a lucrative business, he said.

 He had been assigned the Ranchi territory and he would travel to the Jharkhand capital up to 10 times a month. On each trip, he would carry Rs 3 lakh to 5 lakh in fake notes. 

 But the agents had been told to use genuine notes while buying train or bus tickets or settling bills. They were paid Rs 1,000 in genuine currency on every trip for expenses.

 Singh said complaints of fake currency had been pouring in over the past few months from both banks and individuals. Some of the money had also made it to ATMs. 

 Mandal and gang have named many in Malda and elsewhere in the country who were part of the racket, Singh said. 

 Ainul claimed to be a sub-agent. He had been jailed for the same offence earlier.

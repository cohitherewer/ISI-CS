The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Romance nipped on train

 RABI BANERJEE

 Two youths, not the two from the story, on Valentines Day. (Bishwarup Dutta)

 Krishnagar, Feb. 14: They had been in touch over the phone, across two districts. And there couldnt have been a better day to see each other.

 But St Valentine took away with one hand what he gave with the other. 

 Class IX student Laltu Saha and Sibani Das (name changed), two standards younger, met up and headed to Calcutta but their sweet nothings on a train gave away the truth and passengers caught the runaway couple.

 Before the sun set, the boy from Murshidabads Beldanga and the girl from Chanditala, Hooghly, around 150 km away, were back home and not sure whether they would see each other again.

 Laltu came to know his beloved by chance. He was dialling numbers at random from his new cellphone when she said hello. Long conversations and endless SMSes followed. The bills were long, too, and the phones were confiscated. But that only made the young lovers use landlines, instead. 

 The girl in a chocolate salwar suit today so that Laltu wouldnt miss him travelled over 100 km and the boy about half the distance to be together in Nadias Bethuadahari. 

 They took the train to Calcutta because Laltu felt the city was more exciting. 

 We overheard the girl saying she was scared, said Khusi Poddar, a hawker. 

 The children were taken off the train and the love story came gushing. We called their parents, Khusi added.

 Police came, too, but there was love in the air. Bethuadahari is very romantic with a forest nearby, said an officer. 

 Sibani said: I love him. 

 Her father Susanta said he has to be strict with her. Laltus father was ashamed.

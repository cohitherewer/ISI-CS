The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Govt to seek SC stay on VIPs jail

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 4: The government will file a special leave petition in the Supreme Court praying for a stay on Calcutta High Courts jail terms for the director-general of police and three other senior officials.

 The state will plead for a six-month stay the maximum that it could have to prepare the defence for police chief A.B. Vohra, Jalpaiguri district magistrate R. Ranjit, superintendent of police Tripurari and an inspector-in-charge, who were handed a six-month jail sentence for contempt of court.

 Fourteen others, inclu- ding Congress MLA from Jalpaiguri Deba Prasad Roy, were also convicted.

 A division bench of acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice K.K. Prasad held the officials guilty of failing to clear the entrance to the Jalpaiguri court and allow the judges and magistrates to enter the premises. 

 They also misled the high court, which ordered them to break the siege that lasted a month from mid-December.

 The court, however, stayed the operation of the order for three weeks so that the convicts can move the Supreme Court. 

 The decision to file special leave petition was taken at a meeting attended by senior government law officers.

 According to the Contempt (Rules) Act, the convict has the right to appeal before a higher bench seeking explanation for the earlier order, one of the law officers said.

 A home department official said tonight that the government needed time to prepare its case.

 Lawyer Gitanath Ganguly said it is almost impossib-le for the government to get the order reversed in the apex court. The jail terms might be exempted, but not the conviction.

 He referred to the Rupam Bajaj case in which the Punjab and Haryana High Court handed a jail sentence to an IPS officer for harassing her. 

 When the officer appealed to the Supreme Court and apologised, he was held guilty of the crime and fined. 

 The officials held guilty in Bengal have been fined Rs 2,000 each.

 Advocate Sailendu Rakshit said the government would be better advised to move a revision petition before the high court apologising for its inaction.

 The inaction amounted to direct assistance to the agitators in Jalpaiguri, demanding a high court circuit bench there, the division bench said. The state administration butchered the Constitution.

 Decades of wait for the bench had fanned tempers, but the court held that it could be no reason for the administrations decision to let the blockade continue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata pledge

 Barasat, Feb. 15: Mamata Banerjee today said she would ensure the return of land forcibly acquired in Singur for the Tata small-car project, reports our special correspondent.

 We will do whatever is needed to restore to the owners the land taken by force. This is a challenge, as the state government is not heeding our demand. The government could not acquire land in Nandigram because of a peoples revolt. At Singur, we will force it to return land not given voluntarily, the Trinamul chief told a rally in Barasat on the northern fringes of Calcutta.

 The Krishi Jomi Raksha Committee will hold a meeting in Singur on Saturday following instructions from Mamata.

 Trinamul leaders said there was a possibility that she would visit Singur that day as prohibitory orders are no longer in force after yesterdays high court order quashing imposition of Section 144.

 Father throws son to wheels

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, Feb. 1: A man in a fit of rage today threw his four-year-old son in front of a speeding bus at Basirhat in North 24-Parganas, killing the child instantly.

 According to police, Mantu Sardar, 35, a resident of Duttabad on the outskirts of Salt Lake, was going to his in-laws place with his second wife, Sabita, 26, and Suman, his son from his first marriage.

 After Mantus first wife died four years ago, the casual labourer who works in Salt Lakes Sector V married Sabita. Their relationship turned sour soon after as Mantu accused Sabita of neglecting Suman. Things took a turn for the worse a few months ago when Mantu began suspecting his wife of having an affair with a local youth.

 Mantu, Sabita and Suman left home around 7 am today and took a bus to Kanmari market in Basirhat, about 70 km from Calcutta. 

 Mantu wanted Sabita to stay with her parents to keep her away from the youth with whom he suspected her of having an affair.

 They kept quarrelling all the way to Kanmari Bazar. Even when they got off the bus around 9 am, they were squabbling. Suman was in his fathers arms. Suddenly, Mantu became agitated and hurled Suman in front of a speeding bus that crushed the child under its wheels, said Srinath Das, an eyewitness.

 The driver tried his best to save the child by slamming the brakes but failed.

 Angry residents started beating up Mantu. Police later rescued him and took him to hospital. We have arrested Mantu and will produce him in court tomorrow, said North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar. Sabita was also taken to the police station but was not arrested.

 Interrogation of husband and wife has revealed that they often quarrelled as Sabita was not kind to her stepson. Mantu said she would often beat up Suman. Moreover, Mantu started suspecting her of infidelity, a police official said.

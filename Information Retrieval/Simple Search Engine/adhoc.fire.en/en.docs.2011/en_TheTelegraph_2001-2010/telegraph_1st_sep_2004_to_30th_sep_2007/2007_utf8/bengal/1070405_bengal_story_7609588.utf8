 HC rejects one-spouse divorce

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Husbands, beware

 Calcutta, April 4: The high court today said a divorce obtained in the absence of one of the spouses was not acceptable to it.

 The judgment comes when, lawyers said, many husbands are taking advantage of legal loopholes to obtain divorce by presenting other women as their wives in court and claiming that they want mutual separation. 

 Dealing with one such case, the high court today set aside the divorce decree issued by a Jalpaiguri court in favour of Niren Mitra, a tea garden manager. 

 In December 2004, his wife Shibani was at her fathers house in Calcutta when she received a gift packet. What she thought was a packet of tea was in fact a copy of the divorce decree.

 In case of divorce, an ex- parte decree is not acceptable. So, we are setting aside the trial court order and asking the husband to make arrangements so that his wife can stay in Jalpaiguri and contest the divorce case, a division bench of Justices S.K. Mukherjee and M.M. Sarkar said.

 Mitra will have to give Shibani alimony of Rs 5,000 a month and pay her Rs 10,000 as cost of litigation.

 In case of a mutual divorce, the court first gives a couple six months to stay separate. 

 In many cases, the husband tricks his wife by staging a fake divorce case and presenting someone else as his wife. The so-called couple seeks a mutual divorce. The real wife gets to know about it after the decree is issued, said Siraj Gooptu and Rahul Ghosh, who appeared for Shibani.

 Originally from Bosepukur in Calcutta, Shibani married Mitra in March 1984. They have a son and a daughter. 

 In December 1994, Shibani received the gift while on a trip to Calcutta. She fainted while going through it. 

 When Shibani got back to her husband, he told her the court order was final and she need not return home.

 She moved court with two prayers set aside the divorce order and ask my husband to pay alimony till the disposal of the case.

 The order will make trial courts go into a case in detail before issuing a decree, said advocate Biswajit Bose.

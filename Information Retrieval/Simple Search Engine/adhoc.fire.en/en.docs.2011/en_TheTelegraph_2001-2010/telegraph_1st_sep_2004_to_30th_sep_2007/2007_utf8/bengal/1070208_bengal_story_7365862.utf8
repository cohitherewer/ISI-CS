 Nandigrams poor cousin

 A fencing post on the Tata Motors plot that was uprooted on Wednesday

 Singur, Feb. 7: Trinamul Congress supporters here dug up a pathway leading to Bajemelia village today in a feeble bid to emulate their Nandigram compatriots.

 The road connects Bajemelia with Beraberi, about half a kilometre from the site of the car plant, where there is a police camp. 

 The police are raiding our village almost every night in search of those sawing off fencing posts around the site or setting them ablaze. We dug up the road so that police vehicles cannot enter our area, said Rabin Manna, who did not give consent to the acquisition of the small piece of land that he owned.

 He said more roads would be dug up. Well do what the people of Nandigram did, Rabins wife Shyamali said.

 She was among the 30-odd people who dug up the road around 10 am. 

 Not all women are angry like Shyamali, though. Twenty-five women from landloser families, who were trained at the Institute of Hotel Management in Calcutta, will be employed at the canteen opening at the site tomorrow.

 Industry director M.V. Rao said they would initially prepare daily meals for about 150 people.

 Early this morning, a mob sawed off a few fencing posts around the Tata plot, deflated the tyres of a truck and tried to set ablaze a concrete mixing machine. Two light posts were pulled down.

 When a Rapid Action Force team led by the Singur police station officer-in-charge arrived about half an hour later, the villagers greeted them with brickbats. 

 Police burst 17 teargas shells to disperse the mob, Hooghly superintendent Supratim Sarkar said. An FIR was lodged against members of the Save Farmland Committee. 

 At Chanditala, about 10 km from the Tata site, the Jamait Ulema-i-Hind held a rally against the car factory. Jamait general secretary Siddiqullah Chowdhury, who had yesterday promised a gathering of a lakh people, addressed about 10,000.

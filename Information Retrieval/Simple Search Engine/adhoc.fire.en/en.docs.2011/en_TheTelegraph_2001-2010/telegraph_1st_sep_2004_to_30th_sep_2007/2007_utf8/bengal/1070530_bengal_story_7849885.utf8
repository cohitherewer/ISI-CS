The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata keeps fire burning

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 29: A day after Forward Bloc leader Ashok Ghosh said he was ready to go to Mamata Banerjees house to discuss the Nandigram peace process, the Trinamul Congress leader met the partys core committee and vowed to continue the agitation in Nandigram and Singur.

 Presiding over the meeting in her Kalighat house, Mamata said: The agitation in Singur will continue until the land forcibly acquired is returned to the owners. Our movement in Nandigram should be intensified.

 She alleged later that CPM supporters were launching frequent attacks on Nandigram from their stronghold, Khejuri, and demanded immediate action.

 Trinamul will hold a rally in Calcutta on June 1 to condemn the CPMs refusal to describe the March 14 police firing in Nandigram as genocide. 

 A big public meeting will be held in Singur on June 3 to protest against the governments refusal to return land to farmers who had not given consent to the acquisition for the Tata Motors project.

 The Singur meeting will be a big one, MLA Saugata Roy said.

 Mamata reminded the meeting that the rural polls were round the corner. We should pull up our socks and start reorganising the party. Ill meet workers from Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and minority communities separately, she was quoted as saying.

 Observers feel the Nandi- gram agitation, even after the government has said no land would be acquired there, is more a political movement than a farmers uprising.

 Speaking on the civic polls held on Sunday, Mamata warned against any unofficial alliance, as forged by the party units in Panskura, Durgapur and Dhupguri. This wont be tolerated. Well not have tie-ups with anybody, she said.

 Nandigram, Jan. 8: In an attempt to restore peace, the East Midnapore administration today assured an all-party meeting that no land would be acquired in Nandigram without consulting representatives of political parties.

 The chief minister had made the same promise at a rally in Calcutta yesterday.

 District magistrate Anup Agarwal had convened todays meeting at Tamluk, about 45 km from Nandigram.

 The Congress, however, boycotted the meeting called during its Bengal bandh. Trinamul Congress, CPM, SUCI, CPI, Forward Bloc and RSP leaders were among those present. 

 Another all-party meeting, called by Haldia subdivisional officer Shankar Haldar and IG (western range) Arun Gupta at Nandigram, fell through this evening after Trinamul boycotted it because police had detained one of its activists. 

 The DM had assured us that no large-scale arrest would be made. Then why did the police pick up our worker? asked Sheikh Sufian, the partys Nandigram block secretary. All other parties supported Trinamul and cried off.

 Haldar, who attended the mornings meeting that lasted over four hours, said restoring peace was the primary objective. We have initiated the peace process and it will take a better shape from tomorrow. We will discuss the issue of acquisition with everyone, he said.

 With the assurance of police pickets in trouble-prone areas came the promise of prompt repair of roads dug up by villagers after the flare-up on Wednesday.

 Villagers opposed to the acquisition had dug up four approach roads in at least 25 places to prevent the police and officials from entering Nandigram. 

 Repair of roads and culverts are of the utmost importance to allow the police free movement in the area. It will be difficult to repair the roads without the villagers help, an official said.

 The administration made the parties agree that none of them will run camps or shelters for supporters within 5 km of Nandigram block I.

 The CPM, which is running a camp at its stronghold Tekhali, on the outskirts of Nandigram, will have to wind it up. Its camps at Bhangabera, Sherkhachak, Kurighat and Bangshubazar will also have to be closed.

 Hill outsources Idol votes

 Darjeeling, June 26: If your fingers are frozen after another rapid-fire round SMSing votes for your idol, Darjeeling has found a way out.

 Write a cheque or pay in cash and let a group of volunteers wrestle with the keypad.

 Those who can afford it, such as the Darjeeling diaspora, are already putting money where their finger is to ensure that Prashant Tamang is crowned the next Indian Idol. 

 Tamang, a resident of Toongsoong here, has fought his way to the Top 13 (the judges have added three singers to the Top 10 contestants chosen by the audience) and his fate now depends on the number of text messages he gets following his performance this Friday and Saturday. 

 But as Pranay Rai, the MLA from Darjeeling, puts it: How many text messages can one send? 

 So the hill town residents have followed in the footsteps of their friends and relatives abroad and donated Rs 31,000 to buy prepaid mobile vouchers that will be distributed among the volunteers. 

 The volunteers are expected to work overtime to send an avalanche of SMS votes in favour of Tamang as well as Karma Sherpa, another singing sensation from the hills who has reached the Top 5 of a different contest telecast on a Bengali TV channel.

 We have decided to use the money in a transparent manner, said Tenzing Khambachay, who heads an informal committee set up to garner support for Tamang. Once we give the recharge vouchers to the volunteers, we will check the outboxes to see if they have sent the messages.

 Two SMS committees were formed last evening to monitor the process.

 While the Rs 31,000 collected yesterday, including Rs 10,000 from Rai, will be split equally between the two singers, Tamangs fund will be boosted by contributions from abroad. Our people working in Hong Kong have sent us Rs 17,600 and I have been told that those who are in Brunei have given Rs 8,000, said Khambachay. 

 People in other countries, except the UAE and the UK, cant vote for Indian Idol contestants. The rule has provoked anger among people in Nepal.

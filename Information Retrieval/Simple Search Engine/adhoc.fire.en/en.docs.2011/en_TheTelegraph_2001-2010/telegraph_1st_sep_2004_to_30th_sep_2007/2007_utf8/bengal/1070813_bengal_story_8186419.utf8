 Howrah, Aug. 12: A Burrabazar businessman has been arrested for torturing his nine-year-old domestic help, brought away from her mother with the promise of treatment like his own daughter.

 Howrah resident Ibrahim Dayers wife and daughter have also been accused of torturing the girl. 

 Police said the mother and daughter are absconding.

 Dayer, 48, was picked up from his house on Alam Mistry Lane in the Golabari area last night.

 Dayer, his wife and daughter used to thrash Sabina Yasmin with serving spoons and scald her with a ladle, Howrah superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh said.

 The girl from Debrajpur in North 24-Parganas Basirhat came about 90km away to Howrah after a neighbour who worked in Burrabazar told her mother she knew a babu who wanted a help for home.

 Three years on, Sabina could not take the beating anymore. She fled her employers home before the break of dawn on July 30.

 Sabina boarded the first train she spotted at Howrah station but realised 40km later that it wouldnt go anywhere near her home.

 Railway police found her loitering at Bandel station. They got in touch with the NGO Childline Calcutta two days later.

 The Howrah-based organisation lodged a complaint with the Golabari police station against the Dayers last night.

 Sabina told a chief judicial magistrate today that she slogged for over 12 hours a day but still got beaten up with serving spoons and other utensils and scalded all over the body on the slightest pretext. I couldnt take it anymore. 

 Dayer was denied bail and remanded in jail custody this morning. 

 The sari trader had lodged a complaint with the police after Sabina went missing.

 Babu had promised to look after my daughter like his own and send her to school, Sabinas mother Serina Biwi said. 

 Serina, also the mother of a seven-year-old son, is a daily labourer. Her husband Ali Mondal is missing for five years. 

 The railway police had told the NGO that a mother in North 24-Parganas was looking for her missing daughter. Serina was sent to the NGO-run Don Bosco Ashalayam on August 6 to identify the girl.

 She hugged her daughter and broke down. The two went home that day, but returned to file the police complaint yesterday.

 Cold steals 

 poverty blanket

 - Over 40000 hill people pushed off list of poorest of poor 

 in new survey

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Darjeeling, May 28: The harsh chill of the Himalayas has driven hundreds of people in the hills out of the below-poverty-line bracket.

 Their number of warm clothes has pushed them off the list. 

 The governments logic is that since people in the hills have more clothes (most have over six) than their counterparts in the plains, they are surely better off. 

 The number of clothes people have helps decide if they should be counted as living below poverty level. 

 Unlike in the late 1990s, when a separate survey was conducted to identity the poorest of poor, the government this time used the findings of a social and economic study conducted in 2005-06. 

 About 41,000 people from eight hill blocks who were earlier on the list have gone missing from the new one, and not because they are any less poor.

 The fault lies in the government policy. The questionnaire should be different for different areas, a senior government official said.

In the plains of Darjeeling district, 11,693 more people have been included in the list from four blocks (see chart).

 The GNLF has demanded a fresh survey.

 While 40,000 of our people have been excluded from the list, the number of poor people from the plains has gone up. We want a fresh survey, said Deepak Gurung, the president of the partys Darjeeling branch committee. 

 Pranay Rai, the GNLF MLA from Darjeeling, ques- tioned the logic of the surveys premise. 

 People in the hills will definitely have more clothes. They will not survive without them. What kind of a questionnaire is this? he asked.

 GNLF leaders alleged that most of the 12 questions that were used to prepare the list go against the hill people. 

 In the plains, most farmers prefer to buy 12 buffaloes instead of a pucca house. But the questions have been so framed that possessing cattle is not considered to be a mark of being above poverty line. To people from the hills, a pucca house is a priority because of the topography. So they lost out, said Rai. 

 The survey also took into account migration for jobs to determine poverty levels. 

 Gurung said: Hill people work in tea gardens and dont need to go elsewhere for jobs. But that does not mean they are well off. 

 Subash Ghisinghs party wants the government to frame a questionnaire that is more appropriate for the people here. 

 District magistrate Rajesh Pandey confirmed that over 40,000 hill people have been de-listed. 

 If the political parties convey their grievances in writing, well send them to the government, he said.

 Calcutta, July 15: Met officials today warned of heavy rain across Bengal in the next 24 hours, but it may not be as bad as the downpour earlier this month.

 We expect heavy rain in Calcutta and the districts. It is likely to rain more in the coastal areas than in the city and the weather in Calcutta is likely to improve from tomorrow evening, said G.C. Debnath, the director of meteorology at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.

 The state government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation have been alerted.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya looked worried as he stepped out into the rain after Jyoti Basus civic reception at Town Hall this evening. Is it another low pressure? he asked Faiaz Ahmed Khan, a member of his council. 

 Debnath said yesterdays well marked low pressure in the northwest Bay of Bengal had moved closer to the Bengal coast and was heading to Jharkhand. It is still a low pressure and has not intensified since yesterday. Apart from Bengal, we have also issued a warning of heavy rain in Jharkhand and Orissa, he added. 

 Sharp showers were reported this evening from East and West Midnapore, the two 24-Parganas, Burdwan, Bankura and Birbhum.

 The city sky, clear in the morning, had dark clouds covering it around 3pm as a nagging drizzle started. By 7.30, it was pouring, bringing back memories of July 3, when it rained 160mm in five hours from 3.30am.

 It rained about 75mm till 8.30 this evening in Calcutta.

 Woodburne Street was waterlogged tonight, apparently because of garbage clogging drains rather than the intensity of rain. A civic team led by chief engineer (drainage) Tushar Ghosh was trying to clear the filth.

 The Met office said the city could be spared of very heavy rain. As the movement of the low pressure indicates, the rain will be more severe in the coastal districts. The low pressure has not intensified into a depression this time, said an official.

 The government is not taking chances. District magistrates have been alerted. Water is yet to recede from Sabang and Patashpur and more rain can spell trouble, relief minister Mortaza Hossain said.

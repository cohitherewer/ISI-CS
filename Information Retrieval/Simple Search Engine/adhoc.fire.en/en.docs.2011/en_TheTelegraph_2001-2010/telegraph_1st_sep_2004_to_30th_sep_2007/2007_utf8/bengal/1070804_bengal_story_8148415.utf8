 Laptop target at airport

 Calcutta, Aug. 3: Valuables from the baggage of two passengers who flew in from London were stolen over the past two days, according to complaints filed with airport police. Missing laptops are common to both cases.

 Mahima Bose arrived on July 28 by an Air India flight but the Bhubaneswar resident claims her luggage did not arrive with her. On Thursday, when the baggage was handed to her, she did not find some valuables, including a laptop and two MP3 players. I lodged a complaint with the airline and the police, Mahima said. But an Air India official said he knew of no such complaint.

 Patna resident R.P. Tiwari lost his laptop moments after he stepped outside the international terminal this morning. According to a police official, his luggage was intact on the trolley when he walked out. But someone pulled out the laptop from his bag when he moved away briefly to get a taxi.

 Nandigram, Dec. 7: The momentum against land acquisition had been building up at Nandigram for the last three months.

 We began the movement in October when we first heard from some officials of the Haldia Development Authority that the government would acquire over 14,000 acres comprising 27 mouzas in Nandigram block and two mouzas in the neighbouring Khejuri block. As the news spread, more and more people started joining us, said Syed Abdul Samad, a member of Jamait Ulema-i-Hind, prominent among the several parties opposing the land acquisition.

 Samad, who runs a home for 125 destitute children at Nandigram, said the movement was a very silent but organised one.

 We did not organise big public meetings to mobilise opinion against land acquisition. Instead, we first visited the houses of some select people residing in all 27 mouzas. Then we distributed 600 forms among them to carry out a survey on if they were willing to hand over land for the SEZ. But only 12 forms reached us in November in which people said they were willing to hand over land, Samad said.

 Those opposed to the acquisition then formed the Gana Pratirodh and Gana Unnayan Samiti and also village-level committees at the grassroots.

 Since November, we have been arranging small meetings at farmers houses or courtyards, particularly at night, to motivate them against land acquisition, recounted Bhavani Das, SUCI secretary of East Midnapore. Sometimes, we had to organise meetings in the dead of night to escape the vigil of CPM supporters. However, some CPM men at the grassroots are with us.

 The movement gained further momentum last month when CPM MP from Tamluk Lakshman Seth organised a 10-km march from Garchakraberia to Nandigram. Those who took part were mostly outsiders and very few of those whose land is to be acquired were in it, said Abu Taher, the Nandigram Trinamul Congress president.

 Last month, some CPI members joined the protest after the party MP from Midnapore, Probodh Panda, told a public meeting that he would oppose the land acquisition. 

 We lent support as we are opposed to industrialisation at the cost of farmers, said a local CPI leader who did not want to be named.

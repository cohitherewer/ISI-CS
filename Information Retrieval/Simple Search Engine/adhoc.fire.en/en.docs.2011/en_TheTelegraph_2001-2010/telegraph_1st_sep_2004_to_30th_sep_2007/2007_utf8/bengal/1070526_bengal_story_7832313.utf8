 Calcutta/New Delhi, May 25: The state Forward Bloc secretary today admitted lack of homework before yesterdays all-party meeting and said he would meet Mamata Banerjee soon to fix an agenda for the next round of talks.

 Its true that we had not done proper homework prior to the peace talks, said Ash-ok Ghosh, the convener of the meeting from which Mamata had walked out.

 We were busy selecting invitees and didnt spend time fixing the agenda, which we should have, Ghosh said. 

 Asked if the meeting had failed, he said: Something was achieved. For the first time in 30 years, Mamata shared a platform with us to express her views. This will definitely pave the way for more talks.

 The police firing, which led to 14 deaths, has tarnished the Left Fronts image, Ghosh said, but added that the peace initiative should also take into account the CPM supporters rendered homeless and ensure their homecoming.

 The CPM had objected to Mamatas calling the killings a genocide, prompting her to walk out.

 In Delhi, the party today dubbed the walkout a result of political compulsions.

 Front chairman Biman Bose, now in the capital for the politburo meeting, said no one should act stubborn if peace has to return.

 He took exception to Mamata comparing Nandigram to Jallianwala Bagh. If someone clings to lies, it cannot pave the way to peace. 

 The Bloc chief said he would request Bose to call a front meeting at the earliest to discuss strategy for the next round.

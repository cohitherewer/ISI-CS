 Murder on Singur fringes

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Serampore, Feb. 9: Two bodies found on the outskirts of Singur on Tuesday have been identified as those of Jyoti Prakash Biswas, an engineering diploma holder who worked for a company that provided earth-moving equipment, and his driver.

 Police suspect they were strangled to death and dumped in roadside bushes. Biswas, 37, was found dead at Bora, off Durgapur Expressway, close to the place where Mamata Banerjee will address a rally tomorrow. His driver Kanchan Das, 32, was found at Dadpur, over 20 km away.

 Hooghly police chief Supratim Sarkar said: There is no connection between the deaths and the Singur situation.

 Biswas was attached to a Durgapur-based construction company and came to a chemical factory near the Tata Motors site in a green Scorpio to oversee construction work there.

 The vehicle is yet to be traced. The police are looking into a car-jack angle. 

 It is possible that they became victims of an organised gang, Sarkar added.

 In a Durgapur flat, Bis- wass widow Seema was also trying to figure out the poss- ible murder motive with her one-year-old daughter in lap.

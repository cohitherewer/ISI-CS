The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Affair whiff in murder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 31: An extra marital affair apparently led to the brutal murder of a pregnant housewife in Thakurpukur, on the southern fringes of the city, this afternoon. 

 Mousumi Shashmal, 26, was found lying on the floor in a pool of blood in her apartment with her skull cracked when her husband Subrata returned home for lunch.

 After a preliminary probe, police said Mousumi was in a relationship with her husbands nephew Manojit Bhuinya over the past year. 

 Manojit, who used to stay with the childless couple, is on the run. We are still not clear about who committed the crime but he is one of the suspects , said S.N. Gupta, the South 24-Parganas superintendent of police.

 Gupta said the police got to know about the relationship between Mousumi and Manojit from a diary that the latter maintained. He had recorded details of his relationship with Mousumi in that diary, Gupta said. The picture will be clear after we get to question Subrata. 

 The police have arrested Subrata on the basis of a complaint lodged by Mousumis family alleging that he tortured her. Details of how Subrata used to torture his wife are also recorded in Manojits diary, Gupta said.

 Subrata married Mousumi two years ago and she became pregnant a month back. But Subrata suspected that the baby his wife was carrying may not be his, Gupta said. He tortured his wife over this, too. Manojits diary mentions that. There is a possibility that Manojit was scared that Mousumi would reveal the details of his relationship to her husband. However, it is too premature to jump to a conclusion. 

 According to the police, Subrata left home around 7 am to open his grocery shop in Hazra. As on other days, Manojit was at home with his aunt. When Subrata returned home around 12.30, no one responded to his knocks on the door.

 On letting himself in with a duplicate key, he found his wife lying dead on the floor. 

 A preliminary medical examination has revealed that Mousumi was strangled and then hit on the head with a blunt object. We are looking for it, Gupta said.

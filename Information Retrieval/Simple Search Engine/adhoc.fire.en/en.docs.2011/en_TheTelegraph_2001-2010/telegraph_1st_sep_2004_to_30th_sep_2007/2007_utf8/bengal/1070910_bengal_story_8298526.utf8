 Lightning strikes six dead in Midnapore

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Sept. 9: Six farmers were killed and eight people injured by lightning strikes in various parts of West Midnapore today.

 The dead have been iden- tified as Rupi Pradhan, 50, Sombari Singh, 32, Haripada Paul, 35, Sambhu Das, 35, Netai Das, 40, and Kalipada Murmu, 24. 

 I saw Rupidi charred to death. She was sowing aman paddy while I was standing nearby, said Shyamapada Patra. 

 Forty-two-year-old Shyamapada has been admitted to the Narayangarh block hospital, about 170km from Calcutta, with burn injuries.

 The victims were from six villages spread across five police station areas Narayangarh, Debra, Belda, Kesari and Sabang.

 Prabir Nayak, 40, is still in shock. I was tilling my land with bullocks. I saw the bullocks die in front of me, he said from his hospital bed. 

 Kalipada Mondal, 43, and his 35-year-old wife scurried under the shade of a banyan tree. The couple have been admitted to the Kesari block primary health centre. 

 Kharagpur subdivisional police officer Subrata Ganguly said the incidents occurred between 4.30pm and 5.30pm, when torrential rain and gusty winds lashed East and West Midnapore. 

 The weather office said the monsoon trough passed through the two districts today and sucked in moisture heavily from the Bay of Bengal. This led to the formation of giant columns of cloud and the heavy rain, said an official.

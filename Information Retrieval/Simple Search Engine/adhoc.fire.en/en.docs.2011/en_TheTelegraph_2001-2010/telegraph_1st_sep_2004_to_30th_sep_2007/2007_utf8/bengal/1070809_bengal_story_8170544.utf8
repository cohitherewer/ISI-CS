 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Aug. 8: Salim Group executive director Benny Santoso will meet Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee tomorrow to discuss its proposed mega chemical hub. 

 The project promoters will move the Union commerce ministry for an extension of the in-principal approval granted to its two SEZs last year. Land acquisition for the projects was stalled because of the trouble in Nandigram, where they were to be located.

 Midnapore: Villagers in Belpahari said jawans at the CRPF camp in Neguria mistook villagers bursting crackers to chase an elephant as Maoists on Tuesday night and fired at them. We could have been hit, said panchayat leader Sudhir Mandi. Police insisted that rebels were fired at.

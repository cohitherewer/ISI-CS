The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Goon picnic goes awry

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Jan. 2: Some 20 smugglers all wanted in police records who were picnicking in New Years Day with booze and Bollywood chartbusters flowing, first teased a group of girls and beat up policemen who stepped in.

 The brawl in an idyllic mango orchard, however, proved costly five of them were caught as the police returned with reinforcements that included Border Security Force jawans. 

 A hunt for them had been on for years, an officer said.

 After a late lunch of rice, dal and meat curry in Nadias Gede, about 140 km from Calcutta, and a stones throw from the Bangladesh border, they were gyrating to film songs when the girls strolled nearby. The police said popular songs had drawn them near the other picnickers. 

 The men in their 40s who the police later said were armed with revolvers and pipe-guns must have looked harmless from a distance to three girls, Class X students of a local school.

 The drunk, middle-aged men, however, rushed to them, said a police officer.

 The girls started running and Raju Ghosh, Sridam Biswas, Bimal Maity, Nagen Biswas, Jayanta Pramanick and their workmates gave a chase. 

 They couldnt catch up, though, as they were sloshed, the officer said.

 The girls stopped a passing police patrol and narrated their plight. Three policemen accompanied them back to the orchard. 

 At the sight of the men in uniform, the gangsters whipped out revolvers, guns and knives. The police tried to scoot, but even the drunk goons got the better of them. They were beaten up. 

 One policeman, however, managed to call the officer in charge of Krishnagunj police station, Santanu Bose, from the patrol jeep. 

 Bose got in touch with the local BSF unit and led a large contingent to Gede. The BSF, too, sent its jawans.

 Seeing dozens of policemen and jawans approach, the goons started to run. 

 We caught five of them Raju, Sridam, Bimal, Nagen and Jayanta, said additional superintendent of police Subrata Mitra.

 They are all wanted in smuggling and girl trafficking cases. We had been looking for them for a long time. A hunt is on for the rest, Mitra added.

 Officer-in-charge Bose said the BSF had to be alerted as there was the possibility of the goons try-ing to sneak into Bangladesh.

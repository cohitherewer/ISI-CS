The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Dad hit for tease protest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 12: A teenager on her way to a grocery was teased by a gang of three this evening and her father was beaten up when he raised his voice against it.

 The trio jogged away from the scene of crime a crowded road in Narkeldanga as others chose to remain spectators. 

 Police said the incident on Bipradas Street took place around 9 pm. The shop was close to her house. As she started walking, the three youths identified as Guno, Bhadu and Jhantu started passing lewd remarks. Then they blocked her way, an officer of the Narkeldanga police station said.

 One of the youths held the 17-year-old girls hand and allegedly tried to hug her when she raised an alarm. 

 On hearing the commotion, her father Shyamdeb Saha came out of his house, said the officer.

 On seeing Saha, the trio in their early 20s pounced on him and punched and kicked him.

 The three youths ran away when Saha slumped to the ground, said Pradip Chatterjee, the deputy commissioner of police, headquarters.

 None of the onlookers dared chase the culprits. We came to know about the incident when Saha came to the police station to lodge a complaint, the Narkeldanga officer said.

 Local people have confirmed that they knew the trio by face. They apparently spend most of their time on the road making passes at women. But no complaint was lodged against them, the officer added.

 The girl they molested this evening had apparently been targeted earlier as well.

 The police said an effort is on to track down the trio.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Govt told to shed milk fat

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 14: The government has been told to privatise its four dairies by consultant PricewaterhouseCoopers.

 Asked to study loss-making public sector units, it said the government should offload its stake in the dairies in Haringhata, Belgachhia, Burdwan and Durgapur and get investors to make them modern, corporate entities.

 But the government plans to retain control of the Haringhata and Belgachhia dairies, animal resource development secretary Dilip Chakraborty said today.

 An empowered committee of secretaries will decide the fate of the four that together employ around 3,500 people. It will meet on May 23 for a final view of the reports submitted by consultant.

 As the dairies are not government companies, but part of the government itself, the consultants have recommended that their staff be redeployed, Chakraborty said. 

 Public enterprises and industrial reconstruction department officials said the consultant has recommended closure or joint ventures for most of the 24 enterprises studied as part of the second phase of restructuring with assistance from the British department for international development.

 The Haringhata dairy, about 35 km from Calcutta, is spread across 2 acres and processes around 4,000 litres of milk daily. 

 It has about 1,500 employees, around 1,000 cattle, poor infrastructure and increasing non-performing assets. 

 Besides the dairy, it has a poultry, a goat farm, a piggery and a bacon-processing unit. 

 Officials said Haringhata was primarily a farm where milk was brought from outside and processed.

 Earlier, Benny Santoso, the Salim Group executive director, had expressed interest in taking over the dairy and offered to run it in collaboration with an Australian partner. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee also spoke to Mukesh Ambani and said that only Reliance Industries could revive the dairy. 

 However, the talks did not progress after that.

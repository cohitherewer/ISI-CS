 Asansol, Jan. 29: The Tatas are bidding for Corus and Team India is fighting for the Cup but none has kept the flag flying quite like Sudhirbabu.

 Since the day India won freedom, Sudhir Kumar Banerjee has remained the lone choice of coal miners to hoist the national flag on Independence Day and Republic Day on the Dhemo-Main colliery campus in Asansol. 

 This year, too, the 92-year-old former miner kept his tryst with the Tricolour, adding another link to the uninterrupted chain.

 The same perseverance had earned Banerjee the Koyla Ratna award instituted by the coal ministry. In 1975, he was honoured with the award for his performance and discipline in the mine.

 The patriotic practice could not have had a more momentous beginning. On August 15, 1947, Banerjee started hoisting the flag.

 Sudhirbabu hoisted the national flag on the night of August 15, 1947, on this campus. As is the practice now, we sent him a car on Republic Day morning to bring him to the colliery to hoist the flag. We are fortunate to become a part of history, said Bhudeb Panda, the manager of the mine.

 Ananda Chatterjee, director (personnel) of Eastern Coalfields Ltd, echoed Panda. I saw him (Banerjee) a few years ago when he came to invite me to a blood donation camp. He sometimes comes to me to raise funds for poor students.

 Banerjee fondly recalls the night when India became Independent. The miners had assembled in front of the mine office. Around 100 of us had gathered in front of the mine to watch the flag-hoisting. It was midnight when the then manager of the private colliery, B.N. Bag, called me and requested me to raise the flag, Banerjee said after the Republic Day ceremony on Friday.

 But it was touch and go. Initially, managerbabu had decided to hoist the flag himself. Suddenly, he broke his stride and faced us. He said he was the manager and everyone knew him. He wanted one of the workers and picked me. Next year, too, Bagbabu chose me and from then on, I was selected every year, Banerjee recalled.

 A bachelor, Banerjee is known for championing education in his village, Mithani, about 250 km from Calcutta. He was involved in setting up a library, a higher secondary school and a primary school in the neighbourhood. 

 Banerjee had to discontinue studies because of poverty but he wants the local boys to be educated. 

 Sixty years on, his spirit is not flagging. I still feel the thrill when I hoist the flag.

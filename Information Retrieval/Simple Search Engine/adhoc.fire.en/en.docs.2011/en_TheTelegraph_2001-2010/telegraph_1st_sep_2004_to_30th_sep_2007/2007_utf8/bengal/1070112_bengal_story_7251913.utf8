 Patkar petition

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 11: Activist Medha Patkar and convener of the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights Sujato Bhadra today filed a joint petition before the high court against the government and police for their illegal detention.

 The petitioners made a plea for orders directing the authorities to take penal measures against the police for the alleged illegal detention. They also sought an order asking the government to pay compensation.

 Patkar was arrested yesterday when she wanted to go to Singur where Section 144 is in force. She obtained bail today.

 CPM state secretary Biman Bose today defended the arrest and the governments decision not to allow Medha to visit Singur.

 Governor shuns guard of honour

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kalyani, April 5: Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi today refused to take guard of honour while attending the 15th convocation of the Bidhan Chandra Krishi Vishwavidyalaya here. 

 Authorities of the university, about 40 km from Calcutta, said they had been told by Raj Bhavan officials last night about the governors unwillingness to accept the guard of honour.

 This is the first time that the governor has refused to take the guard of honour. Last night, his office told us he would not take the guard of honour. We, therefore, did not arrange it. But he had accepted it last year, said vice-chancellor Dipak Dasgupta.

 A spokesman of Raj Bhavan said: The governor takes the guard of honour only during his maiden visit to a district. In subsequent visits, that is not required.

 Gandhi sprang more surprises while entering the auditorium around 11.30 am. He spotted Nadia district magistrate Onkar Singh Meena waiting for him at the gate.

 Onkar, you may leave if you have any official work. You need not wait, he told the district magistrate. 

 No sir, I will stay to hear your speech, replied a visibly surprised Meena.

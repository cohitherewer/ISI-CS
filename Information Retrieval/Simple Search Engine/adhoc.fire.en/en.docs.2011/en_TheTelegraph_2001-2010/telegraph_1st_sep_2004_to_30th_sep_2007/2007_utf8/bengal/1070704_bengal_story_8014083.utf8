 New Delhi, July 3: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is understood to have expressed anguish at the incidents in Nandigram and Singur and told a delegation led by Mamata Banerjee that they should not have taken place. 

 Independent sources said Singh was moved by the accounts of the families who had lost members in Singur and Nandigram and had promised to examine every point in their memorandum. Trinamul Rajya Sabha MP Dinesh Trivedi said the meeting went off well.

 Mamata expressed the fear that the CBI, which is probing the Tapasi Malik murder, might come under pressure from the state government.

 The CBI may not receive full co-operation from the state, she told Singh.

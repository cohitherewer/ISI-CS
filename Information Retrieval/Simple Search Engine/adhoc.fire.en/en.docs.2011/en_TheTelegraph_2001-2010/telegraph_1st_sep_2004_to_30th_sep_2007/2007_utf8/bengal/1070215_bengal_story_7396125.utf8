 Red Road crash kills two cops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 14: Two policemen died in a crash between a radio flying-squad van and a truck on Red Road tonight.

 Police said the truck collided head-on with the van near the Mohammedan Sporting ground. 

 The accident occurred around 10.40 pm.

 But sources suggested that the van was chasing the truck and was hit when it overtook and tried to block the runaway vehicle. 

 Such pursuit in the past had been triggered either by demands for bribes or the tendency of heavy-duty vehicles to break traffic rules at night.

 C.R. Dubey, one of the dead, was the driver of the van. The other deceased policeman has been identified as Tapan Roy.

 The injured a sergeant and two constables have been admitted to the Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) in Ekbalpore. The squad belongs to 8th battalion of Calcutta Police.

 Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee reached the hospital and met relatives of the policemen.

 Mukherjee said the van was patrolling Red Road and the truck was travelling on the wrong lane.

 The truck driver and his helper are absconding. It is not known what the truck, wrapped in tarpaulin sheet, was carrying.

 The front wheels of the truck were torn loose by the impact of the crash. The van was reduced to a mangled mass.

 The oil from the trucks engine spilled on to the road, making it slippery and dangerous for vehicles.

 The police sealed the road soon after the accident. 

 Till 1 am, it had not been opened.

 The primary duty of the flying squad is to patrol city roads and alert over the wireless system the nearest police station if anything unusual comes to their notice.

 Immediately after the accident, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Javed Shamim reached the spot and made arrangements for sending the injured policemen to the hospital.

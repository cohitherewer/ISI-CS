The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Suicide curse claims 2 more

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Jan. 14: A young man whose parents had committed suicide jumped in front of a speeding train after apparently strangling his wife at Murshidabads Kasimbazar today.

 With an income of Rs 500 a month, Biswajit Das, 22, was struggling to make ends meet. 

 The resident of Khagra in Behrampore town, about 200 km from Calcutta, had married Suparna after wooing her two years ago. They fought over Rs 10 this morning. 

 District superintendent of police Rahul Srivastava confirmed the couples quarrel over the sum.

 Five days ago, Suparna had demanded the money from her husband, which he was not in a position to give. The tiff continued over the past few days and came to a head today.

 Biswajit, who was unemployed when he got married, had started supplying grocery to local stores a year ago. He was also learning the ropes for making jewellery and earned Rs 200 from a shop.

 But the Madhyamik graduate never earned over Rs 500 a month and running a family of two with that income proved too difficult.

 Biswajits father was a group-D employee at a nationalised bank. A man prone to suspecting his wife, he committed suicide in 1990 following a tiff with her. Biswajits mother killed herself a year later after she failed to get her husbands job at the bank.

 Grandmother Meera, who survived on the pension of her husband, also a group-D bank employee, brought up Biswajit. Five months ago, the old woman quarrelled with him and left for her daughters home in another part of Khagra. 

 Earlier, my husband used to run the family. After he died seven years ago, I shouldered the burden with the monthly pension of Rs 2,800. I never thought my grandsons life would end like this when I left his home, said Meera, breaking down. 

 Police said no food was cooked at the Dases house in the past five days.

 Three days ago, Meeras daughter Maya Majumdar, also a group-D bank employee, went to her nephews house and asked the couple not to fight. She also asked Suparna not to refuse to cook. I could understand their frustration and tried to help him with some money but he refused to take it, Maya said.

 After throttling his wife, Biswajit was overcome with regret, an officer said. 

 He went to Kasimbazar, 5 km away, and jumped before the Calcutta-bound Lalgola Passenger.

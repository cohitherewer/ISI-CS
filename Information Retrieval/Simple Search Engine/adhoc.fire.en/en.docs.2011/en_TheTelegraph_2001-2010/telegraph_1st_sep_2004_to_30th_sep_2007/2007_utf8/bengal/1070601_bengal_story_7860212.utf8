 Burdwan, May 31: A 17-year-old boy died last night, a week after being struck during a clash on a cricket field. 

 Sanjiv Santra was trying to play peacemaker when he was hit on the back of his head with a stump.

 The incident is the latest in a series of fatal cricket brawls across the state. A month ago, 16-year-old Mohammad Imran was beaten to death during a fight over sharing space on the Maidan in Calcutta.

 Sanjiv, from Burdwans Khandaghosh, died at a Calcutta nursing home, hours after he got to know that he had passed Madhyamik.

 His brother Sujit has lodged a police complaint against 25-year-old Asit Singha, who is on the run.

 As the ground was not very plain, we decided that no one would bowl fast. Our game was going well and there were many spectators, including Asit, Sujit said.

 Asit is a clerk in a private company in Delhi who had come home on vacation.

 The match had almost come to an end around 5 pm, when Asit accused me of bowling fast. This led to an altercation. We told him that since he was not playing, he should not interfere, Sujit said.

 Bapan Dhara, who was playing with the brothers, said Sanjiv had rushed to mediate. He asked Asit to calm down as the match was almost over. Suddenly, Asit pulled out one of the stumps and hit Sanjiv on the back of his head. 

 Sanjiv slumped to the ground, writhing. He was admitted to a local hospital and later shifted to the nursing home in Park Circus, where he died around 10 last night. 

 We have launched a hunt for Asit, said the officer-in-charge of Khandaghosh police station, Jugal Kishore Biswas. A case has been started on the basis of the complaint lodged by Sujit on behalf of his mother Alpana, Biswas said. Sanjiv had lost his father when he was nine.

 When the news of Sanjivs death reached home this afternoon, villagers marched to Asits house and hurled stones and brickbats. Biswas said a team of policemen has been deployed in the village.

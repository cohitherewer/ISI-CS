The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Rain toll and train woes rise

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 25: Rain claimed nine more lives today and submerged tracks and subsidence threw train services out of gear, putting thousands in trouble. 

 Dilruba Sarkar, 22, who was being brought to Calcutta for treatment of cerebral haemorrhage, almost exhausted her oxygen support because of the Darjeeling Mails delay.

 The train scheduled to arrive at Sealdah at 6am made it seven-and-a-half hours later.

 We were helpless and scared, said husband Zubed. 

 Waterlogging damaged the automatic signalling system, which affected train timings.

 A landslip along 60 feet of tracks between Bally Halt and Rajchandrapur stations stalled trains on the Sealdah-Dankuni line. A wall along the platform at Bally Halt caved in.

 Railway officials said the platform was being extended and the wall was supporting the earth filling. 

 Trains are running through a single line on the route.

 Subsidence also occurred between Dum Dum Cantonment and Dum Dum Junction and near Hooghly Ghat on the Bandel-Naihati section. 

 Many passengers jumped out of stranded trains and risked walking along the tracks up to Howrah station. 

 In Calcutta, circular rail services were stalled for the third day. Water is being pumped out of the inundated Calcutta terminal. 

 Electrocution and wall collapses have killed eight in South 24-Parganas, Birbhum and West Midnapore in the past 24 hours. Floodwaters swept away a man in West Midnapore.

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta said south Bengal received over 400mm of rain in the past three days.

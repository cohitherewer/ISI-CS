The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Naxalites own up to four revenge killings

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Calcutta, March 11: Four murders in Nadia and Murshidabad in November, which local police claimed were the fallout of personal grudge, were actually the Naxalites handiwork, their Bengal leader claimed today.

 Somen, the CPI (Maoist) state secretary, said the four were given capital punishment because they became corrupt under the patronage of local political parties and had started working as police informers.

 The statement came three months after the outfit claimed that it had launched an operation to eliminate enemies outside their known strongholds Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore. 

 Those killed had apparently been warned. None of them paid any heed to our warnings. So they had to pay with their lives, Somen said.

 Intelligence branch reports corroborate the Maoists claim. Initially, we thought that the killings were a sequel to local rivalries. But a thorough probe revealed that the Naxalite outfit was behind all four murders, an IB official said.

 Abdul Gani was murdered in Nadias Karimpur on November 6, last year. He was close to top police officers in the district and had started extorting money from poor people. He had also helped the police arrest one of our key functionaries, Chandi Sarkar, said a CPI (Maoist) spokesperson.

 There are six police camps at Fazilnagar, where Gani was killed. Even if the administration increases the number to 600, no informer will be able to give us a slip. Traitors will have to pay the price, the statement said.

 The Maoists claimed that they killed two of their enemies on two consecutive days at Shantipur, also in Nadia. 

 On November 19, we punished Sushil Sarkar and Narayan Debnath met the same fate the next day. 

 According to intelligence reports, the Peoples Liberation Guerrilla Army eliminated Sheikh Rafique. 

 The Maoists accused him of siphoning off money granted to flood victims in 2000, said an IB officer.

 The police said the CPI (Maoist) has started spreading its network in Nadia and Murshidabad under the banner of various frontal organisations. 

 We have information that the organisations action squad is active in the two districts and they have plans to eliminate more people whom they describe as enemies, the officer added.

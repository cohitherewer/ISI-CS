The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Tata MD defends Singur choice

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ravi Kant

 Calcutta, March 29: Tata Motors managing director Ravi Kant today stoutly defended the companys selection of Singur as the site for its proposed small-car plant, emphasising that it was based on sound business sense.

 We choose where we want to set up the plant and nobody has the right to speak about the location. It is entirely our choice, Kant said.

 I personally visited twice all the six sites shown by the Bengal government. I was part of the decision-making process in which Singur emerged as the clear choice based on sound business sense, he added.

 Kant today visited Singur with commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen and West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation managing director Debasish Som to review the work in progress.

 Kant also defended the governments stand on providing incentives to the company.

 He said various state governments are still making offers. Why should we consider the word incentive bad? Industrialisation in Bengal over the past has been very poor. If a government is willing to rectify the situation by providing incentives, there is nothing wrong, Kant said. Bengal has missed out earlier on auto industries. When the present government expressed keen interest in re-industrialisation, we thought why not be the first one to capture this opportunity?

 The next four years will see Tata Motors set up three plants in Uttarakhand, Singur and a yet-to-be announced site, Kant added.

 Notice on CM

 Leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee today served a privilege notice on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, accusing him of misleading the Assembly on the Singur land issue by supplying information that was conflicting and at variance with each other.

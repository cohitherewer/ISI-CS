The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Allies cant hide their glee

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 4: The CPMs allies welcomed the meeting today because they felt Jyoti Basu took it upon himself to carry their mission forward.

 Forward Bloc leader Ashok Ghosh, the key negotiator for the Left Front in the peace talks with the Opposition so far, called Basu to thank him. 

 Jyotibababu told me that he called up Mamata inviting her home. I thanked him profusely for taking the right step at the right moment. People of the state will remember him for his efforts to bring back peace, Ghosh said. 

 He had another reason to be elated. Jyotibabu said his move was meant to complete my unfinished task. He would request Mamata to ensure the next state-level all-party meeting is successful, he said. 

 With Basu asking Mamata to keep in touch with Ghosh to continue the dialogue, the 83-year-old Bloc leader felt vindicated. 

 Hurt by rumours that he was creating a mini-front within the Left Front, Ghosh had passed on the baton to the chairman of the alliance, the CPMs Biman Bose.

 We must resume the all-party meeting to ensure that the homeless from all sides can return home before the monsoon arrives, Ghosh said today.

 Its a good omen for Bengal politics. Jyotibabu is the leader for all of us. His initiative has consummated all our efforts, CPI veteran Nandagopal Bhattacharya said. 

 Mamatas attitude is also positive. But she must climb down from her demand that the March 14 (police) firing be described as genocide, RSP leader Kshiti Goswami said. 

 The allies were miffed with the CPM leadership for belittling their peace initiative with Mamata at the front meeting on Saturday. Ghosh had relinquished his responsibility during this meeting. 

 They also accused the CPM of trying to scale down the po-litical impact of the first all-party meeting by shifting the focus to efforts at the local level to bring Nandigram back to normal.

 We were upset over Jyotibabu not attending the last all-party meeting because of pressure from the hawks within his party. Now, we are happy. He has risen to the occasion and overruled them, a front leader said. 

 The Congresss Somen Mitra said: We want peace in Nandigram. Its good that Basu has taken the initiative.

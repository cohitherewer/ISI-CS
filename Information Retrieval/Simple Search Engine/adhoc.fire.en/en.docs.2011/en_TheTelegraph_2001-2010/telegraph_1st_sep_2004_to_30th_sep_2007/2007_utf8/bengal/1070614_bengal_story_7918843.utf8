The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Varsity teachers on warpath

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 13: Teachers of several state-aided universities have decided to launch a movement against denial of re-employment on political grounds.

 According to them, university authorities offer to take back teachers who are inefficient but close to the ruling CPM. 

 Citing an example of the growing trend, the teachers said Kalyani University had recently refused to re-employ a physics teacher. 

 They claimed that Sidhartha Ray had to pay for his association with the anti-Left All Bengal University Teachers Association (Abuta). 

 Teachers of state-aided universities along with scientists and scholars from central government-controlled research institutes have written to governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi, requesting him to take appropriate measures. 

 The institutions include Jadavpur University and Calcutta University.

 We strongly oppose the biased decision of Kalyani University to deny re-employment to Sidhartha Ray. The committee, which had rejected Rays appeal for re-employment, consisted of members who cannot match his expertise in nuclear physics. How could the university take a decision on the basis of the opinion of such a team of experts? asked Dipak Banerjee, a teacher of Jadavpur University and the general secretary of the Abuta. This is an act of academic fraud, he alleged.

 The letter to the governor alleged that nearly a dozen teachers have been denied re-employment in universities like Calcutta, Jadavpur and Burdwan. The Abuta has threatened a statewide movement against the trend. 

 Aurobino Das, the vice-chancellor of Kalyani University, refused to comment, saying a final decision on Rays re-employment was pending with the universitys executive council.

 WBIDC boss bites private bait

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 6: The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation managing director has decided to quit his job.

 Debashis Som, a 1983 batch IAS officer, has sought voluntary retirement and is said to be heading to city-based infrastructure company Subhash Projects and Marketing.

 Its vice-chairman, Subhas Sethi, said Som would be an executive director. We are very happy to have him in our company. Hes an engineer as well as an IAS officer, he said.

 Sources said a fat pay packet and a fresh challenge in the private sector drove Som to the decision.

 He is not the first industrial development corporation MD to make such a move. D.P. Patra had joined Japanese firm Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation PTA as the joint managing director. 

 Last year, WBCS officer Debashish Bose, who was in the election department, took a two-year lien to join Reliance Industries as general manager. His job was to co-ordinate its farm retail plans. Then labour commissioner Ravi Kant joined a construction company. 

 Subhash Projects is a Rs 400-crore company involved in infrastructure, engineering and turnkey projects in water management, power and environmental engineering.

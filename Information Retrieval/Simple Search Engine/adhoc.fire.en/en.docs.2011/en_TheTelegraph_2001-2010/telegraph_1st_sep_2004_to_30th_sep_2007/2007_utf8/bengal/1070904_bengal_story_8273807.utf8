The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Sept. 3: Pankaj Mishra, the Forward Bloc leader accused of vandalising the Reliance Fresh outlet in Girish Park last month, gave himself up this morning. 

 The surrender in the chief judicial magistrates court ended weeks of his cat-and-mouse game with police, who had an arrest warrant. Pankaj was later given bail.

 Calcutta: Relatives of Panihati municipality chairman Manik Sarkar, who died at Peerless Hospital, have accused the hospital and its doctors of negligence. He had been hospitalised with hepatic and kidney problems. A gastroenterologist blamed for the death referred the 66-year-old to a nephrologist. No doctor visited him on Monday, said son Ansuman. The hospital said the doctors tried their best.

 Krishnagar: A 14-year-old boys body was fished out from a pond here, 85km from Calcutta. Pratim Sardar drowned while bathing on Sunday.

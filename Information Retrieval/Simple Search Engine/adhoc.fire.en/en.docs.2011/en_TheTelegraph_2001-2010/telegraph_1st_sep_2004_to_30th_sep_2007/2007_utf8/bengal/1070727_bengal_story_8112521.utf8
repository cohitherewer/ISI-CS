The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Profit relief on House table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 26: The government is set to introduce a bill that will yank the profit tag off most offices held by ministers and MLAs.

 Ripples of the office-of-profit controversy in Delhi last year were felt in the state as hordes of ministers and MLAs resigned from government-run bodies fearing disqualification from the Assembly. 

 The bill, repealing an earlier act, will now pave the way for the leaders to return to their posts. 

 The West Bengal Legislative (Removal of Disqualification Bill) 2007, to be placed on July 31 in the Assembly, is being tabled in the wake of an amendment to the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959. 

 The government said the bill was needed to remove doubts, if any, about disqualification of members due to holding of office of profit. Through the legislation, the government can dispose of any case or complaint that relates to a lawmaker holding a post listed in the earlier act as one of profit.

 The posts exempt from being labelled as offices of profit include those of sheriff, mayor, mayor-in-council member and zilla sabhadhipati. Ministers and MLAs will also be allowed to hold offices in the 109 state-run corporations, boards and authorities.

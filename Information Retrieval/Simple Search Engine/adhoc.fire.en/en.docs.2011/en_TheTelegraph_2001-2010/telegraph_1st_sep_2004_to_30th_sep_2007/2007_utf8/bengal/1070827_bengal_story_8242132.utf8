 CM admission

 Calcutta, Aug. 26: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has told the Left Front partners that he made a slip on the land requirement for the chemical hub in Haldia, giving the impression that the government was downsizing the project. 

 The allies did not take the admission kindly as they complained of CPM doublespeak to keep them quiet. They will vent their ire at the all-party meeting on the hub on September 3. 

 Sen said on Friday the hub will cover 25,000 acres, of which 10,000 have to be acquired. The chief minister had said it will be a 10,000-acre hub on government land.

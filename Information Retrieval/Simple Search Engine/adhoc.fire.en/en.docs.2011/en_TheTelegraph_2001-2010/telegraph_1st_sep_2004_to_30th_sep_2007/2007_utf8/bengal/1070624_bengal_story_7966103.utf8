 Land warriors pick holes in homeless list

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Nandigram, June 23: The Nandigram peace process to ensure the return of the homeless suffered a jolt today with the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee objecting to the list of names submitted by the CPM.

 It names 455 members of 115 families from Gokulnagar in Nandigram, 170 km from Calcutta. All of them had to flee their homes following the March 14 police firing during which 14 persons were killed and several injured. 

 Pratirodh Committee members alleged that the list included CPM supporters who had joined the police in attacking the villagers. 

 Sheikh Sufian, the convener of the committee, said the names of 25 CPM men involved in the March 14 violence have been submitted to the district administration. Some of them figured on todays list, he alleged.

 We will not allow them to enter the village unless they are punished, warned Swadesh Das, a Trinamul Congress leader and a key member of the Pratirodh Committee.

 We can name at least two CPM men on the list Pratap Sahu and Rabin Giri who had spearheaded the attack on our members on March 14. Some others on the list were involved in molestation and rape. So they will not be allowed to return, come what may, added Sufian.

 District Trinamul president Sisir Adhikari suggested there was a risk of the CPM men being lynched while returning.

 East Midnapore superintendent of police Anil Srinivas, however, denied knowledge of the Pratirodh Committees allegations. 

 I have not heard about any complaint concerning todays list. However, if there is a problem, it can be settled through discussions, Srinivas said. 

 Ashok Guria, a CPM district secretariat member who has prepared the list, rubbished the Pratirodh Committees charge. It is a ploy to frustrate the peace process, he said.

 Guria accused the committee members of leaving several all-party meetings midway in order to scuttle the peace initiative. 

 He also criticised the police for failing to ensure the return of the homeless even three months after the firing. We wonder how long this lawlessness would continue.

 With the peace drive running into one hurdle after another, the villagers have been the worst sufferers. 

 Trinamul Congress supporters damaged my husbands shop next to the Tekhali police camp after which they set our house on fire. My son is scared to go to school. I dont know how we will return home safe, said Urmila Das, a resident of Adhikaripara.

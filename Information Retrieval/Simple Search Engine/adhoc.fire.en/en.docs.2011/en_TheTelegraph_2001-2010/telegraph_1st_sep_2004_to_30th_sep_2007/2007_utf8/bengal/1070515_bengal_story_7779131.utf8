 Girl marries off mom

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Raiganj, May 14: Tired of taunts about her widowed mothers affair, a girl got her married off last evening. It was Mothers Day.

 Soma Sarkar has had many tiffs with her mother over the middle-aged man in her life in the past three years. I was always at the receiving end of crude remarks by all and sundry, said Soma, a second-year student of Raiganj College. I wasnt also sure about the intentions of Sadhan Sarkar if he wanted to marry my mother or take her for a ride. 

 Today, she was relieved. I wanted us to get rid of the stigma, she said. Stigma not only of a widows romance, but with a man younger to her.

 Soma escorted 40-year-old Madhavi to Sadhans house in the Debinagar area of the town, not far from hers, with some of the neighbours, . 

 Elder sister Jhuma came with her husband from Malda to attend the wedding. 

 Sadhan, 37, a bachelor, is a clerk with the fisheries department. Madhavi is part of a population project run by the local municipality.

 Nakul Das, a neighbour, said the couple was not aw- are of Somas plans. When Sadhan came to look up Madhavi yesterday, he was told to get ready. Reluctant at first, he agreed. We took their signatures on a stamp paper in the presence of a lawyer, said Das, one of the witnesses. 

 Her late fathers brother Pradip chanted Sanskrit shlokas to add solemnity to the beginning of his sister-in-laws new life.

 Pradip said his brother Pranab had married Madhavi in 1981. An usher at Kamal Talkies, he died when a tree fell on him during a storm three years ago. Sadhan was a close friend of his, said Pradip.

 I can concentrate better on my studies now, said Soma, who also works at a cellphone showroom.

 Sadhans father struck a discordant note, though. Ill tell my son to look for alternative accommodation, said Benoy Sarkar. 

 He cannot bear a widow as his daughter-in-law.

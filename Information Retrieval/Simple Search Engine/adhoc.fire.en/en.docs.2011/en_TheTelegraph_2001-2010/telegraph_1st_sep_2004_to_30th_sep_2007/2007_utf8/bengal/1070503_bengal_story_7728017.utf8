 New Delhi, May 2: The Supreme Court has asked the Centre to state within two months the steps taken to combat fire and subsidence in the coalfields of Jharia and Raniganj. 

 A bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan also asked a court-appointed committee to give details of the work done by the government and coal companies.

 The panel, which submitted a report to the court after a trip to the area, had said it was not satisfied with the work, which was to be done in accordance with the action plan prepared by the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute. 

 The apex court has been monitoring the Centres efforts to tackle the decades-old fire in the mines since 1997, when then MP Haradhan Roy mov-ed a public interest litigation (PIL). The central government, he said, had ignored his representations on the violation of the rights of people in Raniganj, Jharia, Asansol and Dhanbad. 

 Among other things, Roy sought rehabilitation of the people affected, or likely to be affected, by subsidence. 

 In its response, the Centre filed a status report on the implementation of the action plan. 

 Tapash Ray, the lawyer representing Roy, alleged that the safeguards for rehabilitation as well as safety measures were inadequate and illusory. Even the committee had pointed out that there was no provision for economic rehabilitation of the affected people in the action plan, he said.

 Ray also alleged that nothing tangible had been done for the diversion of roads, railway tracks, power lines and the IOC pipeline passing through the area. 

 The first committee to look into subsidence was formed in 1922. After Independence, the government constituted the Gugnani Committee. Its 1979 report still serves as the blueprint for all plans to control fire and subsidence in the region.

 Roy pointed out in his petition that parliamentary panels on coal and energy had said the problem could lead to one of the greatest economic disasters in the country if not tackled immediately.

 The Bengal government has contended that it is the Centres duty to look into the issue, saying the terms of lease to coal companies did not permit subsidence or damage to environment.

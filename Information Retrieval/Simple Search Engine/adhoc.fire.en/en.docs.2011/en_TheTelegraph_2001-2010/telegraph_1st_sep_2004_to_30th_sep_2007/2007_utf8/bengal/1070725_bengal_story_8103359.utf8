 Siliguri, July 24: Baley Lama has spent around Rs 2,500 buying lottery tickets over the past two years. He has won small amounts, too.

 But six numbers 5, 12, 14, 26, 32 and 43 have changed the betel nut traders life forever. He got a cheque for Rs 1.17 crore today.

 I heard that someone from Hamiltonganj had won the jackpot and reached out for my pocket. I had bought a ticket the previous day (March 9) and had missed the draw on TV. All the way to the shop, from where I had bought the ticket, I kept telling myself that it cannot be me, said Lama, a resident of Hamiltonganj near Alipurduar.

 The jackpot combination had been put on display at the shop. I remembered two of my numbers. They matched, and I told myself that I had at least won Rs 50.

 Then he took out the ticket and read 5, 12, 14, 26, 32 and 43. I couldnt believe my eyes. One by one, all the numbers matched, he recalled.

 A Playwin representative handed over the cheque for the lotto he won in March.

 I plan to spend some money for the family (his parents, wife and two children). Ill do some repairs of my house and maybe improve my business. But I havent chalked out any detailed plan yet, the 36-year-old said. 

 He also promised to do some charity. I will definitely help the poor families in the area I live in, providing their children with tuition fees and books. 

 Pathak was asked to explain the delay in handing over the cheque to Lama. The Sikkim government had to carry out several verifications before drawing the cheque in Lamas name, he said. 

 The Sikkim government will deduct 10 per cent of the prize money as tax.

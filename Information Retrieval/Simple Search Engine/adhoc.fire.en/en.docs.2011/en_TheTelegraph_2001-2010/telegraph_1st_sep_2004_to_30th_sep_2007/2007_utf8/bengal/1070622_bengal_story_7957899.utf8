 Police stir in Nandigram 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Tamluk, June 21: East Midnapore police have decided to move in to the Nandigram trouble zone to stop the recurring clashes between the CPM and the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee. 

 The district police, who remained in the background since the March 14 firing, have asked the two sides to maintain equal distance from the Nandigram-Khejuri border. 

 The Talpatti canal separates Pratirodh Committee stronghold Nandigram from Khejuri, where the CPM is in control.

 Today, deputy inspector-general (Midnapore range) N. Ramesh Babu spoke to CPM district secretariat member Ashok Guria and Trinamul Congress MLA from Egra Subhendu Adhikary separately.

 Local CPM leaders expressed satisfaction that the police were playing an active role in the area. We have told the police that we will ask our supporters to be restrained in Khejuri, Guria said. 

 Adhikary said the DIG had taken a positive step by asking the CPM leadership to control its cadre in Khejuri. If attacks from Khejuri stop, the people of Nandigram will not resort to any violence and there will be peace, he said.

 A senior police official said from now on, the police would arrest those caught assembling with arms. Both the CPM and the Pratirodh Committee activists have been asked not to assemble near the border of Nandigram and Khejuri.

 District police superintendent Anil Srinivas said the force has lined up a string of measures to ensure peace in the area. A formal announcement on this is expected tomorrow. 

 We have decided on a series of measures to bring back peace in Nandigram, particularly in areas bordering Khejuri. We will set up a police camp and a number of pickets, Srinivas said.

 The location of the camp and pickets were decided after the police held separate discussions with the CPM and the Pratirodh Committee leaders. 

 A police camp will be set up in Ranichowk and pickets will be installed in Maheshpur, Satengabari, Basulichowk all in Nandigram and Janani Brick kiln, Kanungochowk, Chandirthan and Chunabheri in Khejuri.

 The locations of the police pickets have been selected carefully. Policemen will maintain vigil from the pickets round the clock. Also, a police jeep will be provided to each picket for patrolling, a police official said.

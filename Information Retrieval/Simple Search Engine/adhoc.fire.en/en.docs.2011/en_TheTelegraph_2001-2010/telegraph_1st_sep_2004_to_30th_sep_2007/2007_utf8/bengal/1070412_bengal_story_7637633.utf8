 Manipur cuffs for jailed duo

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Imphal, April 11: A Manipur police team has arrived in Calcutta with an arrest warrant for Rakesh Singh and R.K. Dhanashwar, the two members of the outlawed Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (Prepak) picked up on Sunday.

 The team will produce the warrant in the Alipore court. The duo will be brought back to Manipur for further interrogation, a police officer said in Imphal.

 The two, picked up by the armys intelligence wing be-fore being handed over to the CID, were remanded in judi- cial custody on Tuesday. Now lodged in Alipore Central Jail, they will be taken to court again on Friday.

 The CID said the two had held a series of classes in various parts of south Calcutta to indoctrinate 15 Jadavpur University students from the Northeast with its ideals. 

 The classes were held over the past month. 

 Some of these students were questioned by the police, but let off. They have been told not to leave the city without permission.

 Dhanashwar, said to be a self-styled captain of the outfit that has targeted non-Manipuris in the north-eastern state since 1977, and Rakesh, a lieutenant, were allegedly on a mission to recruit cadres from some of Calcuttas leading educational institutions.

 The two were picked up on the basis of information provided by their comrades Y. Sanjay Singh and Leishram Ibobi Singh, who were arrested at Imphal airport on arrival from Calcutta on Saturday. They had been apparently staying in Jadavpur for months.

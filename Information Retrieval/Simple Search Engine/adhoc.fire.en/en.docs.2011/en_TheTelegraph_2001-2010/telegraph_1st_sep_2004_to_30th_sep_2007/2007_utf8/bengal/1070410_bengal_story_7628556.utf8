The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, April 9: Land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah today gave in-principle ap- proval to a 29.53-acre water body being filled up in the Tata Motors project site in Singur. 

 The nod was given on the condition that the company would create another water body of the same size in ano-ther part of the plot.

 Calcutta: The government told the high court on Monday that it didnt acquire any land for industry after Singur. In an affidavit filed in connection with cases challenging the land acquisition process for Tata Motors small-car plant, the government said there is no automobile factory in the state besides Hind Motors. The Uttarpara factory is now sick. Other states are setting up motor car units. Bengal can solve its unemployment problem only through industrialisation. The Singur cases will be heard on April 13.

 Calcutta: The Centre has turned down Mamata Banerjees request for tax exemptions and duty cuts for those investing in north Bengal and other backward districts. The junior Union finance minister has said location-based concessions lead to complaints from areas from where industries shift to tax-holiday zones. Moreover, they shrinks the revenue base.

 Midnapore, April 17: A policeman chopped off a teenagers hand from the wrist while she held on to the handle of a bus door so that he could not drag her down. 

 The girls fault: giving the cold shoulder to Calcutta police constable Rakesh Alu. 

 Indrani Boyals brother and father were hacked at when they came to her rescue. 

 All three are fighting for their lives at the Ghatal Subdivisional Hospital. 

 Rakesh, 27, was also hospitalised, after being thrashed by a mob at the bus stop in Daspur, West Midnapore. 

 He apparently had an affair with Indrani, 19, for the past two years but she had started avoiding him of late.

 Around 9.30 this morning, she was going to Ghatal with her parents and brother Parthasarathi to update her records at the employment exchange. The siblings were on the footboard and the parents were waiting their turn to board the bus when Rakesh arrived on a motorcycle and whipped out a dagger. 

 He tried to drag Indrani out of the bus and, shrieking in panic, she caught hold of the handle rod firmly. 

 Failing in his attempt to pull her down, Rakesh started hacking at her hand. Within seconds, Indranis right hand was hanging from shreds of muscles and tendons on the wrist. 

 Parthasarathi, 24, grabbed Rakesh and took several dagger blows on his face and hands as did Shibaprasad, 62, a former high school teacher. 

 Stunned and choking, mother Snehalata also a schoolteacher took time to raise an alarm. When others at the bus stop gathered their wits and rushed in, Rakesh was still swinging his blood-soaked weapon wildly. Indrani, Parthasarathi and Shibaprasad had collapsed.

 The superintendent of the Ghatal hospital said Indranis right hand had to be amputated from the wrist. A portion of the left palm had also been lopped off, said Sisir Das. 

 The siblings, who underwent three-and-a-half-hour operations, will be shifted to Calcutta for further treatment.

 Indrani is a first year BA student and Parthasarathi, an engineer who works in Calcutta, about 120 km from their home at Samat village.

 Rakesh lives in neighbouring Rajnagar. 

 We questioned people at both Rajnagar and Samat and came to know that the two had a relationship, which had been strained of late, a Daspur police officer said.

 Snehalata alleged that Rakesh had forced her daughter to sign a paper in January and claimed that they were married. We had lodged a police complaint against him for disturbing our daughter, she said. 

 At the Daspur block health centre, Rakesh accused the parents of forcing Indrani to distance herself from him and refusing to accept that they were married. I wanted to kill them all and commit suicide, said the man who works in the city polices minor traffic violation wing.

 HC takes 16 yrs to pass case

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 13: Calcutta High Court has taken 16 years to conclude that it could not hear the petition of a central government employee who opposed her transfer to Mumbai or Bombay, as the city was called then.

 The petition should have been filed in Bombay High Court, Nirupa De was told today.

 The employee of central government undertaking Export Inspection Agency was a senior scientific assistant in Madras now Chennai when transferred to Bombay in 1983 with a promotion to the post of technical officer. 

 But De did not join her Bombay office. The agency marked her absent for 13 months between August 1984 and August 1985. But she continued to work as a senior scientific assistant in Madras.

 In 1991, De filed a writ before Calcutta High Court, pleading that the agency could not force her to accept the promotion and move to Bombay. 

 In March 91, Justice K. Ganguli issued an interim stay on the transfer and gave the agency liberty to proceed with a departmental inquiry into her refusal to accept the promotion and the transfer.

 The action on the inquiry report, however, had to abide by the high courts final directive.

 Des petition remained unheard for 14 years. 

 In the meantime, she accepted a demotion to the post of laboratory assistant and got a transfer to Calcutta with the high courts approval.

 In 2005, Justice P. Chattopadhyay set aside Des transfer order. 

 The Export Inspection Agency appealed against the order before a division bench of the court.

 Des counsel, Souvik Nandy, said she was almost on the verge of retirement. My client is retiring in February 2010. She has already been deprived of promotion for 24 years.

 The division bench of Justices Pratap Roy and Prosenjit Mondal, however, observed that the trial bench had committed a mistake by admitting the petition in the first place. 

 Only Bombay High Court has the jurisdiction to hear the petition. The petitioner is directed to move a fresh petition before the Mumbai court, the division bench said.

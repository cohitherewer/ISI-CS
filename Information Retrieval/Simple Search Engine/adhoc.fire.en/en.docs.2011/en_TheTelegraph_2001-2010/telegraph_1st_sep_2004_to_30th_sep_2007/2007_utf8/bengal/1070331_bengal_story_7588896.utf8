The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Blood test kits OK, not expiry dates

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 30: The government told the high court today that it would have to go by the National Institute of Biology report that said the blood test kits supplied by Monozyme India were not fake. 

 However, the case against the Sardas owners of Monozyme India Ltd would not be withdrawn as the expiry dates of the test kits seized by police had allegedly been tampered with.

 Hearing a public interest litigation moved by Tapas Sengupta, whose thalassaemic son has to undergo regular blood transfusion, Justices P.C. Ghosh and B. Somadder asked the government to submit an affidavit with reports on both findings the institutes, saying the kits were OK, and the states, pointing out the tampering.

 Sengupta had moved court expressing fear for the lives of his 18-year-old son and hundreds of others, who could contract the deadly HIV and Hepatitis virus because of the kits that were past sell-by dates and were incapable of detecting them. 

 Advocate-general Balai Ray told the court that a state government laboratory, which examined the Monozyme kits, found that the expiry dates on them had been tampered with. 

 The government had sent the kits to Noida to ascertain whether they were fake. 

 The test report said the kits were not faulty. The state will have to abide by the report, Ray said.

 Monozyme owner Govind Sarda was picked up from his Alipore house on September 27 last year for allegedly supplying blood test kits with fudged expiry dates. 

 His brother Ghanshyam was also held. But both were granted bail by the high court after the Noida institute reported that the kits were not faulty.

 Sardas offence is unprecedented, police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee had said earlier. The kits tampered with not only resulted in wrong blood reports but could have led to many deaths.

 Arunava Ghosh, the lawyer appearing for the petitioner, asked: Then why is the government not taking any action against the officers who received the kits with fudged expiry dates? 

 He also asked why the government was continuing the case against the Sardas, though it has been proved that the kits supplied by them were not faulty.

 The advocate-general said: The kits supplied by Monozyme may have been found OK, but the police had seized the kits and found that the expiry dates had been tampered with. So there is no question of withdrawing the case against the Sardas.

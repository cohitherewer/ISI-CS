 Calcutta, May 7: An armed gang today went on a looting spree in a Baruipur village, cleaning out nearly 40 houses.

 Around 35 youths raided Naltehat village in the Baruipur area of South 24-Parganas, about 35 km from the city, around 1.30 this morning.

 They beat up villagers, including an 80-year-old woman, when they tried to put up a fight. A dozen of them were injured. 

 The dacoits decamped with Rs 4 lakh in cash and jewellery. No arrests were reported.

 The first strike was at farmer Baidyanath Gayens house. We were sleeping when I heard someone kicking the door. Soon, half-a-dozen masked men barged into my room. Holding a revolver to my head, one of them asked me to hand over the keys. They spoke in Bengali and called each other by numbers, referring to one as master, said Baidyanath.

 He added that they seemed to be in their twenties.

 The men broke open the almirah and steel trunks in the room and took away jewellery and Rs 12,000 in cash, the farmer said. Before leaving, they warned us against raising our voices or shouting for help. We were very scared and kept quiet.

 The dacoits then went on plundering one house after another till 4 am.

 They stormed into my house and started beating us as we tried to resist them, said Anil Tarafdar, a fisherman from whose house the gang took jewellery and cash worth Rs 10,000.

 When the dacoits left, the villagers were quaking in fear and counting their losses. 

 We could inform the police only after daybreak as we did not have the phone number of Baruipur police station, which is at least 5 km away. Some of us walked to the police station and a force arrived around 8 am, said Swapan Sardar, one of the victims. 

 Swapan said most villagers earn their livelihood from farming or fishing. Several fishermen had borrowed money to buy fishing nets and hire boats. We believe the dacoits knew about it.

 District superintendent of police S.N. Gupta said the gang might have come from a nearby area. I have asked my officers to conduct raids and arrest the culprits as soon as possible, he said.

 Loan trick

 Barrackpore, Aug. 14: A manager of a private bank has been picked up following allegations that a loan was given in the name of a woman who had not sought one.

 Saswata Banerjee, who manages the Naihati branch of the bank, was arrested tonight from his Baranagar house on the charge of forgery in collusion with commission agents.

 Police stepped in after the woman, an account-holder, complained that the bank asked her to repay the loan she never took. The amount was put at Rs 14 lakh, but police are still verifying it. An agent has been detained for questioning.

 Housewife found dead

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mitali Mandal

 Howrah, July 28: A woman who got married eight months ago was found dead next to the railway tracks at Shalimar. Her husband, his brother and her sister-in-law are missing.

 Mitali Mandal, 22, went missing from her in-laws house in Liluah yesterday. 

 Her body bore bruises and her forehead was fractured.

 Mitalis parents, who claim her husband Hemanta, 28, and in-laws had pushed her out of a speeding train, have filed a police complaint.

 Preliminary investigations have revealed that Hemanta, an employee at the Hooghly dock, had an illicit relationship with his brother Jayantos wife, Kajal.

 Police claimed Hemantas mother Tilokbala, who was alone at home today, had confirmed the relationship between him and Kajal.

 It appears that the relationship, which Mitali came to know of, might have triggered the incident, said Niraj Kumar Singh, the Howrah superintendent of police.

 Mitalis father Prabhat Panja said everything was fine in the first few months of their marriage. I had met all of Hemantas demands. But Mitali started complaining to us about her husbands misbehaviour from February.

 In his complaint, Panja also alleged that her in-laws tortured her regularly.

 Government Railway Police officers said they could not confirm whether it was murder or suicide until the post-mortem report came.

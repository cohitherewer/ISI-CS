 Salim readies SEZ plea

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 2: Unfazed by the land acquisition controversy, the Salim Group will go ahead with its plans to develop two special economic zones (SEZ) in the state. 

 The Indonesian conglomerate will soon seek an extension of last years in-principle approval granted by the Board of Approvals under the Union commerce ministry. 

 New Kolkata International Development, the consortium formed by Salim and its collaborators, has written to the state government about its decision to petition the board of approvals for the extension.

 The board had granted approvals for a 12,500-acre multi-product SEZ in Haldia and a 10,000-acre chemical hub in Nandigram on October 6 last year. They are valid for a year.

 State government officials said the SEZ act is silent on extension of approvals. Although there has been no precedent so far, there is nothing to bar the grant of an extension under the law. It is entirely up to the board of approvals, said a senior officer.

 However, if the board suggests Salim apply for a fresh approval, it will have to do so. The state government has said it would not intervene. 

 At the most, the governments role will be limited to endorsing the application, said the officer.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, June 20: A Tiljala police team tonight rescued seven-year-old Mohammad Abid from Bihar, where he was taken to after being abducted yesterday. 

 The police said Mohammed Naushad, who was a tenant at Abids G.J. Khan Road home, had told the boys family that he was taking him out for a walk. But they went to Bihar instead, from where Naushad called to demand ransom from Abids father, a leather merchant. The police tracked the call and arrested Naushad.

 Calcutta: Former bureaucrat Arkaprabha Dev died at a city hospital on Wednesday. He was 65. The 1967-batch IAS officer had served as agriculture secretary to the state government and principal secretary to the governor.

 Behrampore: The engine and three bogies of the Malda Town-Howrah passenger train derailed on Wednesday night, leaving eight passengers injured. The accident occurred after the train hit a road-roller standing on the tracks near Monigram station, about 240 km from Calcutta.

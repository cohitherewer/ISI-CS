 Kalidas RSP seethes at slight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 15: The CPMs spat with its allies over Nandigram refuses to end. 

 The RSP state committee today trained its guns on state CPM secretary and Left Fro- nt chairman Biman Bose, who had likened some of the allies with Kalidas. 

 According to legend, the great Sanskrit poet was about to chop off the branch of a tree on which he was perched when asked to gather wood by his family.

 The partners have been snapping at front leader CPM since the row over land acquisition for industry erupted. 

 Bose accused the allies of being Kalidas-like in the party mouthpiece. He recalled the dithering of the RSP, CPI and the Forward Bloc during the United Front rule between 1967 and 70 and accused them of cowering in the face of Opposition attack now.

 History will prove who is Kalidas, we or the CPM. The CPMs hasty and arrogant decisions in the name of industrialisation have helped the Opposition dent the Lefts rural support base.... We are not supposed to be the CPMs or Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees sycophants, PWD minister Kshiti Goswami said.

 Shelter turns home, at clinics cost

 - Families rule 16-bed health centre since 2000 floods

 A flooded Murshidabad village: Boat ride to health centre?

 Raghunathgunj, Jan. 2: A block primary health centre in Murshidabad has been lying virtually defunct as eight families rendered homeless by floods six years ago have been occupying its premises.

 Three doctors now attend only the outdoor facility at the Rajnagar centre, about 260 km from Calcutta, which has 16 beds and is meant to cater to nearly 20,000 villagers.

 The administration has done little to evict the encroachers but claims to have taken necessary steps.

 When the Bhagirathi flooded large areas of Rajnagar in the Raghunathgunj area in September 2000, the eight families living near the embankments lost their homes. Forty homeless people then took shelter in the health centre.

 There were no patients, nurses or doctors there when they moved in. But even after the floodwaters receded and the health workers returned, the families did not move out.

 Where will I go? I have lost everything in the floods. Now, I earn my livelihood by working as an agricultural labourer in neighbouring villages, said Nazrul Islam, who lives in the health centre with his wife and six children.

 Raghunathgunj block medical officer Partha Pratim Gupta said the families were asked to vacate the health centre several times but to no avail. 

 They (the families) have occupied the health centre and the doctors and nurses quarters. How will the health centre function? All our doctors are examining patients in the outdoor department. However, we are trying to vacate the premises soon.

 Assistant chief medical officer of health Tapas Roy said the Jangipur sub-divisional officer and police had earlier been asked to get the encroachers evicted. But the police did not go to the health centre to get it cleared.

 Rajnagar resident Bairul Sheikh, who visited the outdoor department of the health centre a couple of times last week for treatment of fever, said the centre is the only health facility available close at hand for some 20,000 villagers. The Jangipur sub-divisional hospital is about 10 km away. We go there in case of serious ailments. Otherwise, we depend entirely on the health centre. But now doctors are referring all admission cases to the sub-divisional hospital.

 The outdoor run by the doctors is not enough. One doctor attends to patients for only two hours. There is no infrastructure, no medicines. We have to buy medicines from the market, Bairul added.

 The health centre employees are equally unhappy. 

 We are all getting our salaries but we have almost no work to do because of the situation, said Subrata Saha, a pharmacist.

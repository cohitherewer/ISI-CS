 Trinamul refuses to fill war zone trenches

 OUR BUREAU

 Nandigram/Calcutta, Jan. 15: The CPM today renewed its appeal to the Opposition to join an all-party meeting to be convened soon to return Nandigram to normal life, but the Trinamul Congress made it clear that it will not co-operate with the administration in its efforts to repair dug-up roads.

 According to the Trinamul leadership, the question of co-operating with the government could arise only when it assures the party that no farmland would be acquired in Nandigram. 

 Suvendu Adhikary, a party MLA from East Midnapore, said: We are ready to co-operate with the district administration for the restoration of normality in Nandigram. We also want the roads to be repaired, but only after an assurance is given that agricultural land will not be taken for creation of special economic zones.

 Local Trinamul functionaries had attended an all-party meeting convened by the Haldia subdivisional officer on Saturday to discuss ways to bring life back to normal in the aftermath of last weeks land war, which claimed seven lives.

 That meeting failed to evolve a consensus, but CPM MP and Haldia Development Authority chairman Lakshman Seth today said: We will have to approach local Trinamul leaders again so that they take part in the next meeting.

 According to the chief ministers directive, we must take everybody into confidence to carry forward our industrialisation drive, he added.

 Seth, whose haste in identifying land to be acquired was held responsible for the violence and who was subsequently pulled up by the chief minister and the state party secretary, admitted his mistake today. The notification had sparked a lot of confusion among villagers. The authority should not have hurried on the issue, he said.

 But the Trinamul brass sounded rigid. 

 Leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee said in Calcutta the government wants the roads repaired to make way for the police. It is ploy to facilitate smooth movement of the police, who would create trouble in the villages. It doesnt address the basic problem of farmers that their land is being taken away forcibly.

 Trenches dug up by acquisition protesters on 36 roads, however, have made life miserable for nearly 40 villages in three mouzas Kendamari, Sonachura and Kalicharanpur. Reena Hazra of Saudkhali village said she could not take her ailing son Khokon to a hospital over the past week as the village had bee cut off. The 12-year-old boy has been running temperature. 

 Swapan Mondal, who buys vegetables from the villages and sells them in Haldia, said no business is possible now because of the damaged roads.

 The Congress sounded enthusiastic about the all-party meeting. Its a step in the right direction to defuse the tension and carry forward the governments industrialisation drive, party working president Pradip Bhattacharya said.

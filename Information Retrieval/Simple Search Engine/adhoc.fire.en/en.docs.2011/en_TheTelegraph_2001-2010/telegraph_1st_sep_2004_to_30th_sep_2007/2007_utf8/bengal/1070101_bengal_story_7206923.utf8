The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Crack squad for Bangla border

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 31: The Border Security Force will set up special squads to check infiltration from Bangladesh and handle cases of firing by the Bangladesh Rifles. 

 Each sector of the south Bengal border, which terrorists apparently have been using to cross over from Bangladesh, will have one special unit. 

 Somesh Goyal, the BSFs south Bengal chief, said the squads would have specially trained jawans equipped with modern weapons. 

 We believe these squads will play a vital role in tackling the border threat, which is increasing. They will be called to the border outposts whenever required. They are being created to deal with all kinds of possible threats at the border, he said while inaugurating a sports meet at Gede in Nadia, close to the border, about 140 km from Calcutta. 

 Another BSF officer said Bangladesh was fast becoming a hotbed of ISI activities and the BSF had no choice but to create the crack team. 

 In October, two Pakistan-trained men who had sneaked into India from Bangladesh were arrested in connection with the serial train blasts in Mumbai.

 At least 30 instances of firing by the BDR in 2006 stoked tension along the border, Goyal said. 

 As the land on which the barbed-wire border fence stands is often lower than the road along it, infiltrators get an advantage they cut the fence easily taking advantage of the height of the road. Most parts of the border do not have electricity and the infiltrators get in easily, Goyal added. 

 Plans are afoot to illuminate the 1,100-km border in south Bengal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Buddha hurries Salim

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, July 31: The government today asked Salim Group representatives to speed up work on its projects in Howrah, while agreeing to allot another 100 acres in Uluberia for a two-wheeler ancillary cluster.

 NRI businessman Prasun Mukherjee, a collaborator of the Indonesian conglomerate, met Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee this evening and explained the reasons behind the delay.

 He said the master plan for the proposed logistics hub off Kona Expressway was awaiting an Union urban development ministry nod. Work will start after monsoon.

 Along with Delhi-based Unitech, Mukherjees Universal Success had bagged the contract for the Kona hub in end-2005. 

 Work on Mahabharat Motorcycle Company was scheduled to begin in January 2006. The first two-wheeler was to roll out in 18 months.

 But the investor initially complained of lack of technological partners and left the plot virtually untouched. The group came up with Chinese collaborator Jongsen this year.

 Construction of the factory will begin in October and will take about a year. Were seeking more land from the government for ancillaries, Mukherjee said today.

 Officials said the government has agreed to give the company a plot acquired for a project that was abandoned later. The 100-acre plot is not exactly adjacent to the factory site in Sankrail. Its 10 minutes away, but will serve the purpose of housing the ancillaries, said an official.

 Work on the 390-acre West Howrah International Township, touted the first FDI in housing in India, has not progressed much. The Salims had announced in February 2004 that the first phase would be complete in 18 months.

 Mukherjee blamed the delay on government clearances. Work on the township will start after we receive an environment clearance.

 Officials said there were problems relating to its sewerage and drainage plans.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Stress on talks for plot purchase

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government has decided to modify its land acquisition process, making it dependent on negotiations with landowners.

 The government will approach landowners through the district administration and negotiate prices directly with them. After reaching a settlement with those willing to sell their plots, the land department will be informed and the money deposited, a senior minister said.

 The cabinet discussed the policy this morning when it met to deliberate on a host of land acquisition proposals. 

 Well try direct negotiations first. We will only use the land acquisition act when there is no other resort, commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen told a news conference in the evening. 

 The government has put this model into practice for the Dankuni township being developed by DLF and the proposed Balaji Groups steel plant in Purulia.

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, which is buying land directly from farmers for the 4,840-acre Dankuni township, will give landowners 20 per cent above the value fixed by the government, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya promised today.

 The cabinet okayed the formation of a land procurement committee for the township. 

 It also decided to seek mega chemical hub status for the Nayachar project pending clearance from environment experts and the Geological Survey of India.

 Proposals for a 2,500-acre Videocon steel project and a 1,030-acre power plant in Burdwan were cleared. The 1,850-acre Shyam Steel cold roll mill in Purulia, the Domjur township and the shift of the East Midnapore district headquarters from Tamluk also got the cabinets nod.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Vandalism splits Trinamul

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta, Feb. 21: After Trinamul Congress legislators went on the rampage inside the Assembly on November 30, Mamata Banerjee had said the party would compensate the physical damage done to the historical House in a month.

 Almost three months have passed. Mamata has not mentioned it again.

 Trinamul MLAs are now divided on whether to apologise to the Speaker, who has stopped their emoluments and allowances, or to stand their ground because the vandalism was spur-of-the-moment.

 Apart from a monthly emolument of Rs 7,000, which they earn through the year, MLAs get a daily allowance of Rs 350 and various other benefits when the House is in session.

 The Trinamul members had broken furniture, wrenched off microphones and burnt papers after Mamata was stopped on her way to Singur, where Section 144 was in force.

 A privilege motion was brought against 28 Trinamul MLAs and Mamata, who incited them. The privilege committee will meet on February 28.

 The Speakers decision is insulting. Our legislators damaged some House property on the spur of the moment as they heard about our leaders detention. Well never bow to the CPM, leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee said.

 However, one of his senior party colleagues, who did not want to be named, said: What our MLAs had done cannot be condemned by words. 

 He felt it would be wiser to plead with the Speaker to reconsider his decision. 

 For a few MLAs, the partys image is at stake. It is better to end the impasse during talks with the Speaker at the all-party meeting he has called on Friday, said another MLA.

 Mamatas absence from action because of a gallstone operation has widened the rift.

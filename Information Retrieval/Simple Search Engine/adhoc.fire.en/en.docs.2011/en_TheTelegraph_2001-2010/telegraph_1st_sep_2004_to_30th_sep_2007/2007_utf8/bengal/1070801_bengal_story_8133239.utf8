The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bill relief for house tax

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 31: The Assembly today passed six bills, including one that makes it a must for municipalities to hear out owners objections before the value of a property and its tax are fixed.

 Among the other bills were one to keep government employees out of the purview of Lok Ayukta probe into corruption and another clearing the way for MLAs and ministers to hold multiple offices.

 Property owners in Salt Lake and other municipal areas, who had complained aga- inst the arbitrary valuation and subsequent tax burden, are likely to breathe easy now. 

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya told the Assembly that the provision for valuation of property based on the governments own assessment was introduced to increase tax collection. But the Bidhannagar (Salt Lake) Welfare Association went to the Supreme Court against the arbitrary taxation. 

 The court ordered the restoration of the citizens right to be heard before the valuation and the tax were fixed.

 The Lok Ayukta was created primarily to look into corruption charges against public functionaries, including ministers, MPs and MLAs. But the West Bengal Lok Ayukta (Amendment) Bill, 2007, inserted a new provision to the 2003 law to exclude any investigation of any complaint alleging corrupt practises by government servants. 

 The bill also makes it mandatory for the Lok Ayukta to seek the governments concurrence before asking for help from police or any other investigating agency.

 Defending the move, parliamentary affairs minister Sailen Sarkar said the vigilance commission was already there to probe graft charges against government employees.

 With the passage of the West Bengal Legislature (Removal of Disqualification) Bill, 2007, MLAs and ministers can hold offices of profit in 115 government-run corporations, authorities and boards and draw salary and perks.

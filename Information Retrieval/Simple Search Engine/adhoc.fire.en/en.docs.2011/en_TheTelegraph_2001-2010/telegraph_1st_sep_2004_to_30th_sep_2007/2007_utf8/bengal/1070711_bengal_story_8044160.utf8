The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Wet coal sparks off blackout spree 

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, July 10: Damp coal at the Kolaghat plant has pushed the power situation in the state to the brink of crisis.

 Vast areas of Calcutta plunged into darkness tonight as the shortfall in CESC areas shot up to 190mw. 

 Power cuts ranged between one-and-a-half to two hours in the city and its neighbouring areas. In the districts, the blackouts were more than double that duration.

 Power minister Mrinal Banerjee said Eastern Coalfields (ECL) is likely send a rake of good quality coal tomorrow. But this power crisis is likely to continue for the next two days.

 Kolaghat generated nearly 600mw tonight but that was way below the usual of 950.

 Power Development Corporation, which is in charge of generation in the state-run thermal plants, was forced to close down two 210mw units and bring down generation to about 500mw yesterday because of the wet coal. 

 The move led to prolonged power cuts last evening. The deficit in the districts had shot up to a staggering 600mw.

 The situation has been further compounded by the shutdown of a 500mw thermal unit at the central sector Farakka plant for maintenance. 

 Power Development Cor- poration managing director S. Mahapatra said six rakes carrying some 20,000 tonnes of coal came to Kolaghat from a Eastern Coalfields mine in the blinding rain of last Tuesday and Wednesday.

 We found it very difficult to unload the wet coal at the plant. In fact, when the coal was put on the conveyer belt, there was so much slush that it jammed them, said Mahapatra.

 The coal could not be fed into the boilers. We were forced to close down two units as a result, Mahapatra added.

 Officials of the corporation said the Kolaghat authorities could only unload 30 wagons over the past two days, ins- tead of the usual 150 to 200 wagons everyday. 

 We need to empty the wagons to send them back for fresh coal. We have pressed more people into service and expect to unload at least 50 wagons today, said another official. 

 C.B. Sood, the chief general manager of the ECLs Sonepur Bazari mining area from where Kolaghat sources its raw materials said the coal was dry when the rakes rolled out of the mines. It got wet as the wagons were made to wait a long time on the approach way to the plant, said Sood.

 Nod for rail projects

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 22 : The cabinet committee on economic affairs today approved a Rs 11,589-crore proposal for the Delhi-Howrah dedicated railway freight corridor project as well as a Rs 1,659-crore plan for the Delhi-Mumbai corridor.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram said the projects would be completed in five years. The dedicated multi-axle rail freight corridor would require a double-line electric track to be laid.

 The funds would come from budget as well as non-budget sources and loans from institutions. Market borrowing could also be undertaken for the projects, Chidambaram added.

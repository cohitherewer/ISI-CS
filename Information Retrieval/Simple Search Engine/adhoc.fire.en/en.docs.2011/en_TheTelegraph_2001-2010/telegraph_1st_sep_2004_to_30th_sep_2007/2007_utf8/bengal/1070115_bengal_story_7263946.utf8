The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, Jan. 14: A fire apparently caused by a mosquito repellent coil gutted 60 shops in one of Nadias largest garment markets last night.

 Police said the mart, close to Bagula station in Hanskhali, about 70 km from Calcutta, is one of the largest garment markets in the district and has around 130 shops. The fire started in one of them. 

 Four fire engines, which came from Krishnagar and Ranaghat, at least 20 km away, took about four hours to douse the flames. Garments worth over Rs 15 lakh were said to have been destroyed.

 Calcutta: A deaf-mute couple from Hardwar, on their way to Sagar, died under mysterious circumstances on Saturday. Police said Swapna Devi, 30, who took ill on train, had been admitted to a Bally hospital with breathing problems. She apparently died of a heart attack but doctors were not sure and the body was sent for post-mortem. When the authorities went looking for her husband, Shiv Puri, 45, they could not find him. His body was found on a road late at night, said Howrah additional superintendent of police Milan Das.

 Kalyani: Exiled Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen (right) said she had requested the Bengal government to see that her visa, which expires on February 17, was extended. At a felicitation here, about 50 km from Calcutta, she said she wanted to stay in the state as she loved Bengal.

 Krishnagar: A 70-year-old mans body was found near a pond at Panikhali village in Nadias Dhantola, about 75 km from Calcutta, on Sunday. Police said he had not been identified.

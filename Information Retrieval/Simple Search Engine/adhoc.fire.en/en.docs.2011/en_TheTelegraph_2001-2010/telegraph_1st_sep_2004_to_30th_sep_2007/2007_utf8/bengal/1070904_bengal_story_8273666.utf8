 School in dock for donation

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Krishnagar, Sept. 3: Around 800 guardians dragged their wards out of classes around 10am today and locked the entrance to Basanti Kumari Girls School with teachers inside.

 The Chakdah high school, set to turn 75 next month, is in trouble for asking students to pay Rs 950 for the jubilee celebrations.

 The building would have been repaired with some of the money, the managing committee said. But it is illegal for a government-aided school to ask for any money outside the fees stipulated by the government.

 Tell us under which rule you are seeking such a huge amount? asked Jaba Sardar, a daily wager whose daughter is in Class VIII. 

 Tapas Sarkar, a grocer whose daughter would appear in Madhyamik 2008, accused the teachers of telling Class X and XII students that they would not be allowed to take their board exams if the parents did not pay up.

 Cultural shows, exhibitions and a students reunion are being organised. We needed to repair the building fast, said headmistress Niyati Maity. 

 Managing committee secretary Madhai Mondal claimed most of the 1,200 guardians had agreed to pay the money at a meeting two months ago. 

 District inspector of schools Dilip Khanra supported the guardians. Well conduct an inquiry, he said.

 The teachers were set free after the probe was promised.

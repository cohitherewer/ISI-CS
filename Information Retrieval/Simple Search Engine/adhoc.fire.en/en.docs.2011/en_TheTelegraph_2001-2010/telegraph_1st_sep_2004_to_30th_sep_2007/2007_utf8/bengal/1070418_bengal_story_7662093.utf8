The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Police boss in dock over HM

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 17: The high court today asked the state police chief, the Hooghly superintendent of police and two senior officers to clarify why they should not be put on trial for failing to provide security to the Hindustan Motors management.

 The court had earlier asked the police to ensure peace around the premises, but a manager was severely beaten up by workers last Tuesday, prompting the company to declare suspension of work the following day. 

 On March 3, the high cou- rt had sentenced police chief A.B. Vohra and five senior officers to six months jail for failing to clear the entrance to the Jalpaiguri district court.

 Work in the Uttarpara factory virtually stopped on March 13, because of a strike.

 Justice Dipankar Dutta also asked Amitava Bhattacha- rya, general secretary of the striking Sangrami Shramik Karmachari Union, and 10 of his colleagues to explain why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against them for preventing willing workers from joining duty. 

 A meeting involving the management, unions and the government failed yesterday after the unions demanded the withdrawal of suspension of all employees since 2005. 

 The company moved the high court on March 28, alleging that the agitating workers were not allowing willing employees to join duty. They are also preventing vehicles from entering the factory. As a result, the components of other automobile companies (which Hind Motors manufactures) cannot be brought out, the petition said.

 Justice Dutta then asked the police to help members of the management enter the factory, and told the union not to prevent the willing employees from working. He also asked the police to take all necessary steps to maintain peace in and around the premises.

 A week after that order, the company moved contempt petitions against the police, the striking union and its leader Amitava Bhattacharya who, it said, had failed to honour the court orders.

 The judge summoned the Serampore subdivisional police officer to the court today, but spared the police chief. 

 But all the accused Vohra, superintendent Supratim Sarkar, SDPO Ajay Gupta and Uttarpara inspector-in-charge were asked to answer the contempt charge by May 2.

 The matter will be heard on May 17.

 In Jalpaiguri, people demanding a high court circuit bench there had blocked the court gates for over a month. 

 The Supreme Court, however, stayed the sentence on Vohra and the other officers following a government petition.

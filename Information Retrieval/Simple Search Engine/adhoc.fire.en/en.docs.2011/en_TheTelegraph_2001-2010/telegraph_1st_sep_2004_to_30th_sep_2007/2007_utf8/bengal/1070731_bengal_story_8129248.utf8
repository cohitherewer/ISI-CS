The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 PM flies to Andhra, but no Left balm 

 - Southern town becomes battleground for enemies in the east

 OUR BUREAU

New Delhi/Hyderabad, July 30: Manmohan Singh has expressed regret over the Khammam police firing and iterated the Centres commitment to redistribute surplus land to the landless, according to a re-lease from the Prime Ministers Office.

 Singh met Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy at Hyderabad this evening and discussed the situation in Khammam, where six persons fell to police bullets on Saturday. 

 The bloodshed took place during a Left-sponsored bandh in protest against the Congress regimes failure to keep its poll promise of handing vacant government land to the urban homeless and the rural poor.

 The Prime Ministers pre-scheduled trip was to review the state programmes on agriculture, infrastructure and investment.

 Singh has not spoken to the Left yet on the firing. Sources said the Congress was in no mood to be defensive. 

 The partys contention was that during the violence over land acquisition in Nandigram and Singur and protests against encroachments in Keralas Munnar both states are ruled by the Left the party did not go to town demanding the chief ministers scalp.

 We allowed our representatives from Bengal and Kerala in Delhi to vent their anger. At no point did Sonia Gandhi say Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and V.S. Achuthanandan must go, said a Congress leader.

 The Andhra chief minister acted swiftly and promptly. Hes sensitive to the miseries of the landless, but the Left should know there are no quick-fix solutions. Otherwise, Nandigram and Singur would not have happened, he added.

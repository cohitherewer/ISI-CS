The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Adhir in handcuffs after bail

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Sept. 7: Adhir Chowdhury, MP, was arrested and sent to jail on two fresh charges minutes after he was granted bail in a double-murder case today.

 In a green-and-white T-shirt and cream trousers, the Congress leader came to surrender in the court here at 10am. Hundreds of supporters came with him and stayed on, not knowing that their leader would be put behind bars again. 

 Calcutta High Court had ordered Chowdhurys re-arrest in the double-murder case in which he had been acquitted in May. 

 After he was granted bail today, the governments law- yer told the magistrate that warrants had also been issued against him in two other cases. The MP was accused of plotting the murder of a CPM panchayat chief in Ketugram, Burdwan, and scuffling with Congress workers over the possession of a party office. 

 A chargesheet in the Burdwan murder case was filed last month, three years after the incident. The delay, the police said, was because of the probe into the leaders role in the murder.

 Allowed to step out of the courtroom because he had got bail, Chowdhury waved at supporters. The CPM has framed me, he said.

 The state Congress has offered him legal help.

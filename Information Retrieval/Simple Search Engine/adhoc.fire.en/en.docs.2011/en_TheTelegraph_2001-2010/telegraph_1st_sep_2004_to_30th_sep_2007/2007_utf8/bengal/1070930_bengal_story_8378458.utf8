 Neglect cry after NRS baby deaths

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 29: Two newborns died at Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital today allegedly because of doctors negligence. 

 Doctors said Banani Guhas son died of exhaustion during labour. The woman was taken to the labour room twice before delivery and sent back to the ward. 

 A caesarean delivery could have saved her, a doctor told me, said Bananis hus-band Shyamal. No one asked us if we were prepared for a caesarean section.

 Shilpi Ghoshs day-old son also died this morning. 

 Her husband Samar, a businessman from Dum Dum Cantonment, said: They did not allow us to see the baby yesterday and told us today that he was no more. 

 The body had blood clots on the face, he alleged. 

 NRS authorities said they were probing the charges.

 Both parents have lodged complaints with the Entally police station.

 Shyamal, who lives in Topsia, is a private tutor. His wife was admitted to NRS on Tuesday. She started having labour pain that afternoon and was taken to the labour room. 

 She was brought out of the labour room at 11pm, said Shyamal. The doctors told her she would be taken to the room if the pain returned. 

 It did, within half an hour. But no nurse or doctors paid any heed and so we took her to the labour room on a trolley, the husband said. This time, too, she was sent back to the ward, from where she returned to the labour room hours later. 

 At 1pm on Wednesday the family was told that a boy had been born at 7.45am but had to be kept under observation. He died this morning.

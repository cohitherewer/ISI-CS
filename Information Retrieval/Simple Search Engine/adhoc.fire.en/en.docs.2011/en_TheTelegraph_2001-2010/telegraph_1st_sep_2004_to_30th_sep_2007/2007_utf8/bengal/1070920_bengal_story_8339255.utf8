 Tamluk, Sept. 19: The warning of a March 14-like resistance to police was rung in Nandigram after 200 jawans staged a flag march this afternoon. 

 The exchange of fire and bombs between Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee and CPM supporters yesterday and inputs that Maoists have sneaked into the area apparently prompted the march along an 18-km stretch from Reyapara to Tekhali.

 East Midnapore police chief G.A. Srinivas declined comment on the Maoists. We decided on the vigil to ensure peace.

 As 26 vehicles with armed personnel snaked through, the committee leaders went into a huddle. Trinamul Congress MLA Subhendu Adhikary attended the meeting.

 The committees convener, Sheikh Sufian, said: We believe that the police are preparing the ground to storm the villages. We will resist them with all our might.

 Adhikary promised to mobilise lakhs of people from other parts of the district.

 Fourteen people were killed on March 14.

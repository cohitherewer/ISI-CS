 Calcutta, March 19: The English examinations for Class XI students of higher secondary schools that were supposed to be held tomorrow have been postponed across the state in view of a bandh called by Maoists in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore to protest the Nandigram police firing.

 The Class XI examinations in English (A) and English (B) slated for tomorrow will stand postponed in entire Bengal. The postponed examination will be held on April 17 from 2 pm, Debashis Sarkar, secretary, West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education, said today. 

 This is the first time Class XI students are appearing for their annual examinations at centres other than their schools.

 According to Sarkar, barring some minor incidents, todays Class XII higher secondary examinations passed off peacefully throughout the state, including Nandigram. 

 Eighteen candidates out of 953 could not sit for the exams in Nandigram, though. Of these 18, 16 are appearing for the HS exams for the second time, said block development officer Ashok Sarkar. 

 A school in Bankura, around 230 km from Calcutta, saw the exam being held up for some time when three youths arrived on a two-wheeler and snatched the question paper from an examinee who was sitting next to a window on the ground floor. 

 The authorities of the school lodged a complaint at the Bankura police station and informed the district inspector of schools, headmaster Ajit Khan said.

 The student was given a fresh question paper when the exam resumed a few minutes after the incident, he added.

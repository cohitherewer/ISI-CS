 Hungry estates

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, March 6: The Jalpaiguri administration has decided to appoint one nodal officer for every three closed tea gardens in the Dooars.

 The officials of deputy magistrate rank will monitor development schemes, distribution of relief and medical facilities in the estates. 

 The announcement came 24 hours after Anuradha Talwar, the adviser to the Supreme Court food commissioner, alleged that the government did not have the machinery to keep tabs on abandoned estates and depended on unreliable sources for information. 

 On a recce here, Talwar has suggested several measures to fight starvation, which claimed at least four lives in seven days in a garden. Having community kitchens in closed estates and complaint books at panchayat offices were some of her suggestions. 

 Although several schemes and proposals are finalised at the district and state level, only a fraction of them filter down, Talwar said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Nandigram cops shifted

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, March 21: Officers in charge of the Nandigram, Sutahata and Durgachak police stations were transferred today.

 Nandigram OC Shekhar Roy, Sutahata OC Sandhi Singha Roy and Durgachak OC Rathindra Nath Bakshi have been sent on pre-promotion training to Barrackpore.

 Although officials insisted that the transfer was routine, the timing has led to speculation on the role of the officers in the Nandigram firing.

 Mahisadal police station OC Partha Sanyal will replace Shekhar Roy, while Kaushik Basak from Tamluk police station will be the new Sutahata OC. Nandakumar OC Biswajit Halder will take charge of Durgachak.

 Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee said the transfer of the officers was aimed at suppressing facts related to the March 14 firing. Congress leader Manas Bhunia demanded to know the real reason behind the sudden transfers, especially when a CBI probe is on.

 Incidents of violence were reported from the Gokulnagar area of Nandigram today when members of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee took out a procession in memory of those killed in the police firing.

 The police said a group of Pratirodh Committee supporters ransacked a CPM office. But committee leaders alleged that bombs were hurled from the partys office.

 A group of CPM supporters who fled their homes in Nandigram met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today. 

 The group was led by Mahishadal MLA Tamalika Panda Seth. The villagers said the chief minister assured them he would look into their problems.

 House cordon

 The presence of over 100 security personnel inside the Assembly today sparked protests from Opposition members, who described it as the blackest day in the history of parliamentary democracy.

 The sight of plainclothes securitymen cordoning off the Speakers podium and the seats of ministers angered Trinamul Congress MLAs who disrupted question hour. The MLAs, led by leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee, later walked out of the House.

 Congress and SUCI members staged separate walkouts.

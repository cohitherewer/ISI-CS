The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 No time for child bride

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kajipara (North 24-Parganas), May 6: A 12-year-old old girl was being forced into marriage on Friday, but the local block development officer did not intervene because, by her own admission, there were more pressing tasks. 

 Four young men from Dadpur village in Barasat, who went to the groom Sheikh Pintus house in Kajipara to remind the family the marriage was illegal, were allegedly locked up in a room yesterday. 

 Police came to their rescue after one of the youths called them from his mobile. 

 Debarati Ghosh, the Barasat II BDO, said she had received complaints from the villagers on Friday morning. I could not take any immediate step as I was busy with work related to next years panchayat polls. However, I have ordered an inquiry. We have to find out whether the marriage was illegal, she said today.

 Class VI student Nasima Khatun wanted to continue school, but not her father Sahad Ali, who trades in scrap.

 On Friday morning, we pleaded with the BDO to stop the marriage. Her reaction was shocking. The same government campaigns against child marriage, said Amir Ali of Dadpur, about 40 km from Calcutta. 

 On Saturday, Pintu, a garment dealer, brought the child to his house in Kajipara, 5 km from Dadpur, and a reception was arranged in the evening. The four youths landed up at the venue and protested against the marriage.

 Pintu became angry. He grumbled that he had hardly received any dowry and called his relatives. Nearly 100 people surrounded us and confined us to a room, said Sudip Ghosh, who was one of the four.

 He was able to speak to Nasima before he was taken hostage. She thought her father had got her married because he was very poor. She wanted to continue her studies, said Sudip. 

 Barasat officer-in-charge S. Chatterjee, said he had sent a team to rescue the villagers but could not take any action (against Pintu) in the absence of a written complaint.

 District magistrate P.K. Mishra said the allegations of inaction were grave and they will be looked into. Ive ordered an investigation.

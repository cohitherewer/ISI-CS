 Immolation bid after theft charge

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta/Burdwan, July 14: A 22-year-old tried to set himself on fire, stung by the accusation that he stole Rs 100 from his landlords room.

 Pritam Biswas doused himself with kerosene on Strand Road near the new secretariat building, but some pedestrians caught hold of him before he could light a match. 

 The polytechnic student from Katwa, Burdwan, was handed over to police, who brought him to Hare Street police station.

 Pritam told the police that he had felt humiliated when his landlord accused him of stealing money a few months ago. 

 He told us he left the landlords house and was living with his parents. We contacted his parents in Durgapur and they confirmed that he had been suffering from depression for the past several months, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police, headquarters.

 Pritam left for Calcutta early this morning, said his father, Bikash Ranjan Biswas, a retired teacher of the boys school in Durgapur Steel Plant.

 He told us he would return in the afternoon after finishing some work. We came to know about the incident when the police contacted us. 

 Bikash Ranjan said his son had got admission in the Bengal Institute of Technology in Katwa last year. But he could not bear the ragging and left the hostel. He then rented a room in a nearby locality. For the past month, he has been staying at home, he said, adding that Pritam had been taken to a doctor and was on medication.

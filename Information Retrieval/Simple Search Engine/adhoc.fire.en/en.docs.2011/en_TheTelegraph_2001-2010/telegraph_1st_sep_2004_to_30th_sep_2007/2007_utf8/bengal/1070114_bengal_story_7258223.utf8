The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Buddha rap on hasty MP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 13: Haldia Development Authority chairman and CPM MP Lakshman Seth today faced flak from the party top brass for the haste with which he had issued the Nandigram SEZ notification. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state CPM secretary Biman Bose today met party leaders from East Midnapore at the Alimuddin Street headquarters to review the situation in Nandigram.

 The notification for identification of the land for the SEZ to be set up by the Salim Group had triggered violence in Nandigram last week that left seven people dead. 

 The chief minister tried some damage control when he announced that he had asked the district magistrate of East Midnapore to tear the notification into pieces.

 Sources said Seth argued at the meeting that his move was aimed at speeding up industrialisation in East Midnapore. But Bhattacharjee refused to buy it. 

 It wasnt proper to start the identification process when the Haldia utsav was on, as that clearly sent wrong signals, he was reported to have told the MP from Tamluk.

 The chief minister added that public opinion should have been sought before issuing the notification and that the district authorities should have been taken into confidence, the sources said.

 In the afternoon, Bhattacharjee and Bose met leaders of South 24-Parganas to discuss land acquisition for the Salim Groups projects in Bhangar.

 It was decided at the meeting that the CPM would publish a booklet on the need for industrialisation and the unnecessary controversy arising out of meaningless protests by the Opposition. 

 The party will also launch a campaign across the state from January 15 to February 28. Our focus will be on convincing the masses that Bengal will survive only if industry flourishes, Bose said.

 Students rally

 Student leaders affiliated to various Naxalite outfits today said they would visit all the places where land is set to be acquired for industrialisation. 

 We have already visited Singur and Nandigram and will shortly go to Bhangar, Baruipur in South 24-Parganas and Haripur in East Midnapore and talk to the people, come what may, Jishnu Dasgupta, the convener of the Chhatra Chhatri Sanhati Mancha, told a gathering of 14 students unions at Jadavpur University. 

 The forum was recently floated to protest against factories coming up on farmland.

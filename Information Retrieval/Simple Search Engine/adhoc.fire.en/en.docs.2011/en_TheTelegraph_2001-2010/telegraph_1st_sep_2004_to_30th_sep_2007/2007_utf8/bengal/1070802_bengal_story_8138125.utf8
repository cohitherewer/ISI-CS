The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Salt Lake fumes over drainage 

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Aug. 1: Crores have been spent on drainage and sewerage systems in Salt Lake, but the townships residents are most unhappy with the amenities.

 A study to measure the satisfaction levels of people in 40 municipal areas from Kalyani in Nadia to Budge Budge in South 24-Parganas has shown that most are not happy with their drainage and sewerage. But the government had not spent in the other areas as much as in Salt Lake.

 The figures that we have got after the study, especially on our drainage and sewerage networks, is alarming. It is clear that the people are not satisfied with the existing system, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said at Writers Buildings. 

 More the Salt Lake residents get, the more they want, the minister said. They have to understand that we have pumped in crores of rupees to build the infrastructure in Salt Lake. But the study shows that the more developed and urbanised a municipal area, the more the residents expectations. We have faced a similar situation in Barrackpore.

 The UKs department for international development (DFID) funded the citizens satisfaction assessment, carried out by the Bangalore-based Public Affairs Foundation from April to November 2006.

 Drinking water supply, maintenance of drains, sanitation, solid waste management, approach roads, health, property tax valuation and services such as issuing birth and death certificates, trade licenses and building permits were assessed. 

 Bhattacharya said the government will draw up development plans based on the findings of the study. It was difficult to plan our course of action earlier as the information available was vague. Now we will fix the priorities.

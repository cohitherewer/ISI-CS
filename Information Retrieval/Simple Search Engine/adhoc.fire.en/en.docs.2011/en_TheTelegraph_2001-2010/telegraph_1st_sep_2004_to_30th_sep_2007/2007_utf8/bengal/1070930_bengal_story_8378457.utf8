The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Teen held for toddler rape

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 29: A 13-year-old boy was arrested in Sonarpur on the southern fringes of the city today for allegedly raping a two-year-old girl. 

 The babys mother had left her with the boy who lives next door as there was no one else at home and she needed to go to a shop. 

 She found the girl crying on her return and put it down to hunger. 

 The mother suspected what had happened when the baby refused to stop crying, said father Putul Singh, who works in a private firm. The boy denied the charge when the parents confronted him.

 South 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said a medical examination had confirmed rape. We arrested the Class VII student after getting the report.

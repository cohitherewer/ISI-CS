 Nandigram bail after FIR lapse

 Calcutta, April 9: Every police move on Nandigram appears to be jinxed.

 The high court today granted bail to all 14 people arrested on charges of attacking the police on March 14. 

 The police earlier claimed that they forgot to take the FIR to the Haldia court where the 14 were first produced. 

 The residents of Bhangabera, Tekhali and surrounding villages were accused of hurling bombs and attempting murder. The police action, apparently to establish the rule of law in Nandigram, killed at least 14.

 The police produced the accused in court on March 15, but did not furnish an FIR. When they were produced again two days later, the police produced an FIR lodged on March 14. This proves that there was political motive behind the arrests, the counsel for the accused said.

 The high court rejected the governments opposition to the bail prayer.

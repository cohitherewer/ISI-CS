The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 B3 unlikely, Mamata confirmed

 - BJP amp; Jamait left out of invitee list

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 22: The CPM made it clear today that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhatta- charjee and state party chief Biman Bose would not attend Thursdays all-party meeting on Nandigram. 

 But Mamata Banerjee will be there. I havent yet decided whom to take with me, the Trinamul Congress chief said.

 Well attend the meeting since restoration of peace in Nandigram and Khejuri is a must, she added. 

 Forward Bloc state secre- tary Ashok Ghosh, who has convened the peace meeting, said: Mamata wanted me to send her a written invite. 

 Letters were sent to 16 parties today, but not the BJP and the Jamait Ulema-i-Hind. 

 Ghosh said no one wanted their presence, indicating Mamatas refusal to let her allies share the platform.

 Trinamul is still part of the BJP-led NDA and Jamait is at the forefront of the Trinamul-led outfit spearheading the Nandigram agitation.

 The Left Front chose to stick to its initial decision to invite only parties with representation in the Assembly. Ghosh bowed to pressure from various quarters and withdrew his invitation to the Biplabi Bangla Congress, the Revolutionary Communist Party of India and the Naxalite CPI(ML) Liberation late tonight.

 Jamait leader Siddiqullah Chowdhury, however, sniffed a CPM plot in his partys omission. The CPM is scared of us. So, it influenced the Bloc to keep us out, he said.

 The venue for the meeting to discuss peace might have to contend with trouble at its own doorstep. BJP supporters will demonstrate outside Mahajati Sadan on Thursday.

 The chief minister cant attend the meeting because of some administrative constraints. However, I have requested him to ensure the implementation of the decisions of the all-party meeting, said Ghosh.

 State CPM chief Bose, also the front chairman, has told Ghosh he has to take a flight to Delhi on Thursday. I requested him to take a late evening flight, the Bloc leader said. 

 CPM patriarch Jyoti Basu, too, has been non-committal on health grounds, virtually leaving second-rung party leaders to attend the talks. 

 It is believed the CPM is not happy with the allies leading the peace drive. Mamata had made it clear that she would not attend a meeting called by the chief minister or his party.

 Yesterday, Bose declined to call a front meeting as urged by Ghosh, apparently to pre-empt a move by the Bloc, RSP and the CPI to get the CPM brass to agree to attend the talks.

 Bose and state party secretariat member Benoy Konar have made no bones about their misgivings at the mini fr- ont of the three allies, who also differ on what the meeting should discuss.

 Mamata iterated that the Nandigram killings must be discussed and those involved punished. The CPM, though, feels only a court can decide who are guilty and the punishment they deserve. 

 Mamata and the allies want compensation for the March 14 victims. 

 The CPM has been insisting on compensation for the families of all the victims of the land war since January.

 Nandigram, March 27: Over 100 sawmill owners and timber merchants here are out of business now because their wood is rotting on the roads. 

 Over 100 furniture makers, too, are sitting idle. 

 Hundreds of logs have been lifted from shops and bricks carted away from kilns by the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee to block village roads since January 3. 

 Sheikh Suleiman usually stocks up timber during winter because they are dry and are of good quality. I had 2,500 cubic feet of timber this winter, nothing now. My logs are lying across roads in at least 20 places on the 7-km stretch between Sonachura and Kalicharanpur, said the owner of Mother Saw Mill. 

 Saw mills and furniture stores in the area employ hundreds of people, who have little to do now with politics pushing other activities to the brink.

 Sheikh Khaje Hussein, who owns Madani Saw Mill, said over a couple of dozen roads are now blocked with logs at nearly 150 places. All these logs are ours. Altogether 100 saw mill owners and timber traders are suffering. Each of them has lost around Rs 3 lakh, Hussein said.

 After the timber supply dried up, the furniture makers stopped taking orders. Since January, I cancelled orders for wedding furniture worth about Rs 2 lakh, said Subodh Barui, who has a store at Nandigram Bazaar.

 Construction work and repair of houses has stopped since the land war erupted. Janmejoy Adhikary, a brick supplier in Sonachura, said his entire stock had been taken away. Our survival is at stake.

 Bhupati Mondal of Kalicharanpur had stocked six truckloads of brick for his new house. The day the trucks arrived in January, the Pratirodh Committee leaders asked me to unload the bricks on the road. They are still lying there. Some villagers shoo me away whenever I try to bring them back. 

 Sabuj Pradhan, a Congress leader and convener of the committee, said: We are using the logs and the bricks in the interest of the villagers to protect their land. 

 Cong protest

 Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee today defended the agitation in Nandigram. 

 He told a rally in Behrampore: There is nothing political in the incidents there as people are trying to save their land and livelihood. They have suffered the Left Fronts oppression for decades and now they are protesting.

 The Congress held a rally in Calcutta protesting against the police firing in Nandigram on March 14, which killed 14.

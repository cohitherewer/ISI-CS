 Durgapur, Sept. 11: A second-year electronics and communication student was allegedly pushed down the veranda of a two-storey hostel in a Bankura engineering college after being thrashed by classmates on Sunday night. 

 Sudipto Mondal, 20, was hospitalised with a deep cut in his forehead and injuries in a leg and arm.

 His father Dehipada, who lives in Arambagh, Hooghly, has lodged an FIR naming six students. Mallabhum Institute of Technology, Bishnupur, has also filed a police complaint.

 An attempt to murder case has been started against the six, who are absconding. We are looking for them, said subdivisional police officer Dyutiman Bhattacharjee. 

 When Sudipto retired in his room after dinner around 10pm on Sunday, six boys led by Prosenjit Sarkar banged on the door. Sudipto opened it as they threatened to break it open, the police said.

 Armed with rods and hockey sticks they barged into the room and started beating me up. Then they dragged me out. My roommate, Suman Ballav, was pushed away when he tried to save me, said Sudipto.

 Another group of students, who came to Sudiptos rescue retreated after Prosenjit and his associates threatened them with dire consequences. It was Prosenjit who is said to have pushed Sudipto from the veranda. The attackers fled when Sudipto fell. 

 Doctors at the subdivisional hospital said Sudipto needed four stitches on his head. 

 The registrar told me around 2.30am that my son was injured in a fight with classmates but it was nothing serious. I left for Bishnupur early yesterday morning, said his father, a land and land reforms officer at Ghatal, West Midnapore. 

 Mondal took his son home yesterday, but returned to Bishnupur, 200km from Calcutta, today for the probe.

 Registrar Shankarlal Dutta said there was an old feud between Prosenjit and Sudipto. It is not a case of ragging. 

 Sudipto denied having any enmity with any classmate.

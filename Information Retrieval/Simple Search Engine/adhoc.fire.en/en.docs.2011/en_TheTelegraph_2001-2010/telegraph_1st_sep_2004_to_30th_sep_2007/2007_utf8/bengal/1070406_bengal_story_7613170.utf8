The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 ASI eye damaged in assault by senior

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Barasat, April 5: A BSF assistant sub-inspector, allegedly thrashed by two of his colleagues for moving court against his harassment by some senior officials, today landed in hospital with grievous injuries to his right eye.

 Madanmohan Panja, 44, assistant sub-inspector in the pharmacy wing of the BSFs Calcutta headquarters, was admitted to the NRS Medical College Hospital. A doctor attending to Panja said his right eye has been damaged to a considerable extent.

 Panja had moved the Barrackpore court in January complaining about regular harassment by some senior officials.

 In February, Panjas wife Rekha lodged a complaint with Baranagar police station alleging she was molested by some senior BSF officials when she went to plead with them to stop harassing her husband. When the police did not take any action, the couple moved Calcutta high court.

 Rekha said her husband was asked to report for duty at the Hasanabad border outpost in North 24-Parganas yesterday, which he did. 

 Around 2 am, two officials, including a deputy commandant, woke him up at his tent and beat him up, asking him to withdraw the court cases. They rained blows on him, injuring his right eye, she said.

 Rekha got a call from her husband and rushed to Hasanabad with some relatives. We took him to Basirhat hospital, from where he was shifted to NRS, she said.

 BSF officials refused to comment on the incident. This is our internal matter. We cannot comment on it until we get a report from the Hasanabad border outpost, said V.M. Bala, a senior BSF officer.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, April 2: A Class XI student killed himself last night, apparently unable to bear the taunts of his teachers and classmates about his failure in the mathematics final examination.

 Rupayan Bhowmiks parents saw him hanging from the ceiling of his room at their Adarsha Pally house in Nimta, North 24-Parganas, this morning. 

 The 17-year-old boys father Chhatrapati, a government employee, said he was upset over the results, declared on Friday. He has lodged a complaint saying some of the teachers, too, rebuked him, said Praveen Kumar, the district superintendent of police.

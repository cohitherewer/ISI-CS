The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Talks for peace, plan for politics

 OUR BUREAU

 May 15: Mamata Banerjee has tentatively agreed to an all-party meeting on May 26, Forward Bloc sources said today. 

 However, the date has not been finalised as the two-day CPM politburo meeting is to be held in Delhi from May 25 and the chief minister and state CPM secretary Biman Bose would be attending it.

 CPM sources said they could fly back after the first day.

 Jyoti Basu will also be part of the meeting. He was instrumental in arranging it, said the Blocs Ashok Ghosh, who is in touch with Mamata.

 Front leaders said the meeting would not be a single-day affair. Itd be difficult to discuss all the issues that are going to be raised by the different parties in a day, said Ghosh. 

 Peace on her lips, Mamata told party leaders today not to let the CPM get back its lost ground in Nandigram. Local MLA Subhendu Adhikary has been told to ensure there is no let up in the agitation. 

 The Trinamul Congress leader, who is steering the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee, told his party chief over the phone today that meetings were being organised to highlight the CPMs role in the March 14 killings.

 Asked why the order to step up agitation, Mamata said: The people are with us now.

 We have no problem joining the peace talks as the people (rendered homeless by the violence) do have the right to return home. But the CPM will try to let loose a reign of terror once the homeless return: that will not be tolerated. 

 The district CPM today submitted a list of 3,886 homeless supporters to the East Midnapore administration. 

 Trinamul leaders met in Nandigram to work out strategy. The objective is to keep the issue burning , a key party functionary said in Calcutta.

 Didi has her eyes on Khejuri and Haldia, said Adhikary.

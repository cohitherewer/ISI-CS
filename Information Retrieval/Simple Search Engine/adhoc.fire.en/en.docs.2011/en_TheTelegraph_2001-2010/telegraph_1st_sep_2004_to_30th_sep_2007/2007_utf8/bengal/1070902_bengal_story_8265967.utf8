The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Pranab in CPM show

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 1: Pranab Mukherjee, who played a key role in Delhis talks with the Left on the Indo-US nuclear deal, will share a platform with CPM leaders to slam American imperialism tomorrow. 

 The foreign minister will open the Indo-Vietnam Friendship Festival at Netaji Indoor Stadium. The programme is being organised by a body of which Jyoti Basu is the president and former CPM legislator Rabin Deb the secretary.

 Former Vietnam Vice-President and freedom fighter Nguyen Thi will be the chief guest and a delegation from that country will be part of the event.

 Ill be there, Mukherjee said. Asked about the possibility of the CPM using the occasion to slam the UPA governments deal with the US, he added: The programme is significant to me because of the legendary Madam Nguyen Thi.

 Born in 1920, Nguyen Thi played a key role in Vietnams struggle against French colonialism. She was elected Vice-President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 1992.

 Deb said: The nuclear deal is bound to crop up tomorrow. Party veteran Benoy Konar echoed him. 

 CPM sources suggested that Mukherjees presence showed the partys appreciation for his role in defusing the political crisis over the deal. 

 Mamata Banerjee was not happy, a Trinamul leader said. Pranabbabus friendship with the CPM is well known.

 Rally chaos: A Left Front procession against a naval exercise in the Bay of Bengal involving the US from Tuesday paralysed traffic in the city today. The marchers walked from Shyambazar to the Maidan.

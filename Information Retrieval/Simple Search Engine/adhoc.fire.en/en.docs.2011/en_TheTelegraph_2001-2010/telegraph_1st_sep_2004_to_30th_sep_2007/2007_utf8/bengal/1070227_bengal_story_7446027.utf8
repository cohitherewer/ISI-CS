The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Farm meet, factory pitch

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 26: Bengal can give away 1 lakh acres of farmland for industry but the states agri-productivity will have to be boosted simultaneously, agriculture commission chairman R.N. Basu said today. 

 Officials said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee made a strong pitch for industrialisation at the commiss- ions meeting this morning, saying his government needed only 1 lakh acres for industry out of the states 1.35 crore acres, which is a little more than 1 per cent.

 Basu spoke after the meeting chaired by the chief minister at Writers Buildings. 

 Bengal is land-scarce and the man-land ratio here is very high. However, if productivity is increased, we can give 1-2 per cent of agricultural land for industry, he said. 

 The role of good hybrid seeds would be crucial in raising productivity, said Basu, an agriculture expert.

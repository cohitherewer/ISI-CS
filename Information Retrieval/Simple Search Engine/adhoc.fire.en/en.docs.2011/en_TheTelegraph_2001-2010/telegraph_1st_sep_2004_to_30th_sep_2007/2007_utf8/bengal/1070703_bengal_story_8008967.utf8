The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Capital cool to Mamata show

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 2: Mamata Banerjee today called on President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam as she kicked off her nationwide movement against acquisition of farmland.

 The Trinamul Congress chief led a team of Krishi Jomi Raksha (Save Farmland) Committee supporters and bereaved families from Nandigram and Singur to Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

 They will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow.

 We wanted to make waves, said musician Kabir Suman, who is associated with the movement.

 But the first day failed to create any ripples in the capital. The Mavlankar auditorium, where the victims narrated their stories, did not attract any big names. 

 While the media presence was mediocre, there was almost no sign of any other party leaders or activists who normally wouldnt let go of a chance to speak for Dalits and minorities. Most Nandigram victims are Muslim and from poor homes.

 Mamata and her team will also visit Thiruvananthapuram, Mumbai and Tripura.

 In the Kerala capital, the campaigners will be banking on dissidents in the CPM and the Indian Union Muslim League to create an impact.

 Addressing reporters after the programme, Mamata continued to pour venom on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, calling him a hypocrite and sub-human.

 The Trinamul leader iterated her demand for scrapping the special economic zone act and the 1894 land acquisition act. 

 Mamata was, however, quick to add that she was not opposed to industrialisation or the Tatas who have acquired land in Singur to set up a small-car factory.

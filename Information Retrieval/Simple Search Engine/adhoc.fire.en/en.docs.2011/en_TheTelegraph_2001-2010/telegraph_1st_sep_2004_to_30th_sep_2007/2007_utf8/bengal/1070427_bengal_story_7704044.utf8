The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 State woken up to college truth

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Kalyani, April 26: The University Grants Commission has said enrolment in undergraduate courses in Bengal is one of the lowest in the country.

 Figures provided by the UGC show that only 9.7 per cent students who pass higher secondary-level exams in the state enrol in colleges.

 The findings are from a recent study by the National Sample Survey, at the request of the UGC.

 UGC chairman Sukhdeo Thorat revealed the figures while addressing the convocation of Kalyani University today. Your (Bengal government) endeavour for industrialisation will not succeed unless you have well-structured higher education, he said.

 Thorat said the UGC had decided to give scholarships to all PhD candidates irrespective of whether they have cleared the National Eligibility Test.

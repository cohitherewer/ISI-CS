The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 RSP wants a one-to-one 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 17: The RSP has decided to urge CPM state secretary Biman Bose in wri-ting to hold a bipartite meeting to discuss differences bet- ween the two parties on the CBIs role in the Tapasi Malik murder probe.

 Reacting to the CPM charge that the CBI was conspiring against the party and trying to nail its Singur leaders, RSP minister Kshiti Goswami had suggested that it amounted to applying political pressure on the agency. 

 The remarks prompted CPM secretariat member Benoy Konar to seek a written clarification from the RSP leadership on whether the party had more faith in the CBI or the Left Front.

 Goswami, the PWD minister, said in the Assembly: Our party state committee met yesterday and decided to defend my stand that no pressure should be put on the CBI. I never said anything that could have harmed Left unity and my party also thinks so. So, we will send a letter to the CPM leadership asking for a meeting to clarify our stand and sort out the differences on the CBIs role.

 According to Goswami, the RSP leadership believes that the comments against the CBI would affect investigations and were not desirable in the wake of revelations that hired men could have been used to kill the 18-year-old anti-land acquisition activist.

 The CPM leadership should not get worried at the arrest of a party leader. It should stay away from controversy, particularly when the CBI has found that hired killers were involved, the minister said.

 Biman Bose, also the front chairman, and CPM patriarch Jyoti Basu, had accused the CBI of being partisan. 

 Biman Bose and Benoy Konar have often made remarks against the allies. We need to discuss whether only non-CPM parties should keep their lips sealed, Goswami said, when asked about the bipartite meeting.

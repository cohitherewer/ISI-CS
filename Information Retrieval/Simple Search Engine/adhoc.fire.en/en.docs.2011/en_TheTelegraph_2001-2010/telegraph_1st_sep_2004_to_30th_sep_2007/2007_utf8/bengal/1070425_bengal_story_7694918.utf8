The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, April 24: Another fire broke out this morning in Phase I of the Falta SEZ, about 80 km from here. 

 Three fire engines fought for nearly four hours to douse the flames. Firemen said the blaze could have started from the burnt plastic that have been smouldering since the April 9 fire that gutted seven factories.

 Krishnagar: A deaf-mute boy, believed to have gone missing during the March 14 violence in Nandigram, was spotted near here on Monday. A cloth bag with a Nandigram address emblazoned on it slung across the shoulders, he was loitering in Nadias Dhantola, 75 km from Calcutta. 

 Calcutta: The high court has given the government a week to frame a policy on the diesel engine-fitted motorised cycle vans that ply in the districts. If the government fails, the court said, the vehicles would be banned.

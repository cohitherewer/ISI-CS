 Nandigrams health in CPMs hurt

 Tamluk, Sept. 3: The CPMs slipping grip over Nandigram has ironically ensured something good for the people.

 An under-construction party office at Samsabad has been sold off for the construction of a health centre.

 Work to build the office was on in full swing when the land war broke out at nearby Garchakraberia in January. 

 Nandigram zonal committee secretary Ashok Bera said the party was forced to stop construction. Trinamul Congress supporters ransacked a number of our offices and set fire to some of them. Our men feel insecure in many Nandigram villages now. So, we feel there is no use building a new party office there, said Bera.

 The land and the half-con-structed building was sold off to the Samsabad village panchayat. We have received Rs 1.2 lakh from the panchayat authorities and kept it in the bank, said Bera.

 The CPM lost its foothold in nearly 100 villages in Nandigram block I, such as Garchakraberia, Kalicharanpur, Gokulnagar, Sonachura, Adhikarypara, Tekhali and Samsa- bad, after the March 14 police firing that led to 14 deaths.

 The elected village body, however, is still under CPM control. Its chief, Abdul Rafique, said the health centre was being built at a cost of Rs 8.5 lakh. We are in the last stages of construction and hope to complete it soon.

 The Pratirodh Committee was happy that a health centre had replaced a CPM office. We will co-operate with the panchayat in running it well, said leader Abu Taher.

 In Nandigram, the CPM has 74 branch and six local committees and a zonal committee, but the party is being forced to hold its local organisational polls outside the war zone this year.

 East Midnapore district secretariat member Ashok Guria said nearly 1,300 CPM supporters are still living in refugee camps at Kalagechhia, Sherkhanchowk and Kunjapur in Khejuri and Reyapara and Hatiberia in Nandigram block II. 

 The situation is just not right to hold our organisational polls in Nandigram block I, said Guria.

 The meetings in the run-up to the polls will be held at Khejuri and Reyapara in Nandigram block II and Haldia.

 Guria added that no initiative was being taken to help the people in camps return home because of the lack of security in Nandigram.

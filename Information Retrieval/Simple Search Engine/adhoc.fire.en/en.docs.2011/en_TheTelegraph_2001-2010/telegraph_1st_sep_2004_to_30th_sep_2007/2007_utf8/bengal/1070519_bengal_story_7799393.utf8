The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata fumes at speech cut

 ANINDYA SENGUPTA

 Calcutta, May 18: The references to Nandigram in Mamata Banerjees Lok Sabha speech on Tuesday have been expunged from proceedings.

 The Trinamul Congress chief, who had been allowed to speak on the condition that she would not raise state iss- ues, is not happy. Parliament had allowed discussions on the Godhra carnage. So, why cant references be made to (the police firing in) Nandigram? Can murder be labelled a central or state issue? she asked today.

 Mamata has written to the Lok Sabha secretary-general, asking him why her speech on farmland acquisition for industry had to be edited.

 In her speech, Mamata urged the Centre to condemn the murders in Nandigram and sought a directive asking the Bengal government to restore peace in that area.

 I was surprised and shocked to find that my reference to the Nandigram incident has not been included in the proceedings. I raised the issue in the Lok Sabha to inform the Union government how innocent people, mostly Scheduled Castes and minorities, had been attacked and killed by the state. Parliament cannot disown responsibility and keep mum, she said today.

 Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, who praised Mamata when she focused on the larger issue of farmland acquisition, interrupted her when she strayed.

 BJP members joined her to protest against the Speakers decision and the House had to be adjourned.

 But before that, Somnath reminded the BJP that the party had raised the same objection when the Congress wanted to discuss the Gujarat fake encounters in Parliament.

 Mamata sought Sonia Gandhis help to bring Nandigram back to Parliament. She had sent a Congress delegation to Nandigram. Why cant she request the Speaker to allow a debate on the issue?

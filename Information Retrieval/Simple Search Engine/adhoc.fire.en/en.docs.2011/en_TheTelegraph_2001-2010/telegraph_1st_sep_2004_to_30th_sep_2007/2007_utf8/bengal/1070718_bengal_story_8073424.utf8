The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Allies lifeline to land bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 17: The CPMs allies wont mind supporting an extension of the term of the assembly select committee that has failed to reach a consensus on the land ceiling bill. 

 The support will ensure that the bill doesnt lapse. 

 CPM sources said the gov-ernment is unlikely to push for the relaxation of the rural land ceiling, which has raised the hackles of the allies and the Opposition, before the 2008 panchayat polls. Its now a political decision whether we want the bill to die a natural death or offer it a lifeline by asking for an extension of the committees term, land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said. 

 A Forward Bloc leader said: Neither are we going to change our stand (on the bill) nor will the CPM goad us into it till the rural polls.

 The RSPs Amar Chowdhury said the party wont oppose an extension of the panels term. But Mollah will have to ask for it before the term ends on August 1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Basu blow to Mamata

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 15: Jyoti Basu today spelt out what he had hinted a few days ago: alternative land cannot be provided to Singurs unwilling farmers.

 On Sunday, the CPM patriarch had met industries minister Nirupam Sen, who explained to him that there was no scope for providing alternative land. Basu had then indicated that he found merit in Sens case.

 Today, he ruled out the option of providing alternative land to farmers who have not collected their compensation. 

 Another point seems to have prompted Basus stand the former chief minister said he has realised that the 600-acre plot opposite the Tata Motors project site, which the Trinamul Congress had suggested could be given to the farmers, is private land and cannot be handed over. 

 When Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee had met Basu at his home, she had also told him that the Tata factorys ancillary units could be shifted to the 600-acre plot. 

 After the meeting, the CPM veteran had appeared sympathetic to her demands. 

 But Basu today said: I have come to know that it is not government land but private land. This cant be given. However, I dont know why she is rejecting the alternative package without even going through it. Its the best package in the country. 

 Sen clarified that the note on the package would not offer any additional compensation, equity stakes in the Tata unit or direct jobs to land-losers, but would focus on job creation.

 We are still working on the package, he said. The focus will be on creation of jobs and development of technical skills so that the land-losers can use the upcoming opportunities.

 Mamata said she had no choice but to continue with her protest. The government does not appear to be sincere in meeting our demand, which is land must be returned to the unwilling farmers. So, the government has forced us to continue our agitation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 10 benched for Besu row

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 8: Bengal Engineering and Science University has suspended 10 students indefinitely after violence on its campus yesterday. 

 Six of them are third-year students and four are from the fourth year. 

 The action was taken on prima facie evidence, said the professor in charge of students affairs, Col. A.K. Ghosh. The disciplinary committee will meet on Monday for an inquiry.

 The suspended students, however, can sit for their mid-semester exams that begin on Monday. 

 Yesterdays violence broke out after a fourth-year electrical engineering student was assaulted in the canteen.

 The uproar came on a day the state higher education minister, Sudarshan Ray Choudhuri, and CPM MPs Basudev Acharya, Swadesh Chakrabarty and Hannan Mollah visited the campus for a seminar on the universitys proposed upgrade to an institute of national importance. 

 Today, the students union protested against the arbitrary suspensions, which they said was done without any inquiry or investigation. The union wrote to registrar Indranath Sinha demanding that the suspensions be revoked. 

 We do not know what led to the suspension of these students because they were not involved in any violence. One of them was not present on the campus yesterday. They have been falsely implicated. We demand a thorough inquiry, the letter said.

 Later, the union claimed that the registrar had revoked the suspensions, but Ghosh denied it. He said the suspensions will stay, but after the students pleaded with us we have allowed them to sit for the exams.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 RG Kar student found

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Suri, Sept. 12: A second-year student of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, Calcutta, was found roaming aimlessly in Rampurhat town last night. 

 A police jeep on patrol saw Pavan Kumar, from Paigiri village in Nawada, Bihar.

 He spoke incoherently but produced an ID from his pocket that said he was an RG Kar student, a police officer said.

 An ATM card, Rs 430 and a Howrah-Katihar train ticket were found on Pavan, now in a Rampurhat hospital. 

 Doctors initially thought he had been given some drug-laced eatables on the train but tests proved that was not the case. We have treated several patients who have been drugged in train compartments. But Pavan may be suffering from a psychiatric problem like schizophrenia. He is on sedation, said Himadri Haldar, the hospital superintendent. 

 An RG Kar official said Pavan went missing from the college hostel around 3pm yesterday. He had been treated for a psychiatric disorder in the college once.

 Bengal police have asked their Bihar counterparts to get in touch with his family.

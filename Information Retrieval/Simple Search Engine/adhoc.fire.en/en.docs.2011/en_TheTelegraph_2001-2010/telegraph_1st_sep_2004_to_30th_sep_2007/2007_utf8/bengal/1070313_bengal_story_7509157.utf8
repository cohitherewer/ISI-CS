The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Hotel student found dead

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Durgapur, March 12: A final-year student of the National School of Hotel Management was found dead this morning on the railway tracks between Waria and Andal stations, about 210 km from Calcutta. 

 Avishek Gourav, 21, who hailed from Ranchi, went missing from the City Nursing Home here yesterday. He was admitted on Friday with abdominal pain.

 A team of Government Railway Police (GRP) personnel carrying out their daily inspection of the tracks found the body with multiple injuries on the chest and neck. His severed legs were lying beside the body.

 GRP officials said preliminary investigations revealed that Avishek had committed suicide by jumping in front of a running train. 

 They said the incident was referred to the Durgapur police station where the nursing home authorities had registered a missing diary last morning after he went missing on Friday night. 

 The GRP identified the body after recovering a drivers licence from the pocket of Avisheks tattered trousers. The body has been sent for post- mortem.

 Avisheks father H.L. Sahay, who arrived here yesterday from Ranchi following information from the institute authorities, today refused to accept that his son had committed suicide. 

 My son must have been murdered and I shall lodge a complaint with the police, said Sahay sobbing, soon after identifying the body.

 I did not find anything wrong with Avishek when he had spoken to me over his cell phone from the nursing home before he went missing from there, Sahay said. Why will my son commit suicide?

 However, Pannalal Goswami, circle inspector, Durgapur, said this afternoon that prima facie, it appears to be a case of suicide. Nothing can be said until we get the post-mortem report. We have registered a case of unnatural death.

 The nursing home authorities said he was about to be released yesterday. But in the early hours yesterday, our staff found Avishek missing from his bed. We informed the police and the institute authorities, A.K. Bhattacharjee, a doctor of the nursing home said. 

 We are probing how Avishek disappeared as we have security guards at the main gate and on each floor.

 Arnab Roy, the principal- cum-director of the private institute on the citys outskirts, said: This is unfortunate. The student was good in conduct and studies. I am shocked at the tragic death.

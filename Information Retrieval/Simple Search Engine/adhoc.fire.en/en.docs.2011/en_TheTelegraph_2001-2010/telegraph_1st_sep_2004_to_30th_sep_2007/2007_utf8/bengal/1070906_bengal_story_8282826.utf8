The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Keep cool, says Gandhi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 5: Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi today said teachers who beat students cannot be called teachers.

 At a programme to felicitate 16 retired teachers for their outstanding contribution, he said: Every teacher must learn to control anger.

 Similarly, the governor (picture above) said: Students who dont respect teachers and often hold them hostage cannot be called students. 

 Reports of teachers hitting students brutally have become common. A class IV student at Dhubulia in Nadia had to be hospitalised after being hit with a duster because he wanted to take his meal home. 

 Teachers, too, have been on the receiving end. Students and guardians of a school in South 24-Parganas gheraoed lady teachers for several hours last month because they were wearing the salwar kameez.

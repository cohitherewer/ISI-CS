The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bullet for refusing drink

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Feb. 11: A young man barged into a central Calcutta bar past Saturday-Sunday midnight and allegedly shot at an employee on being denied a drink. 

 A bullet hit Sanjay Paswan, 24, in the leg. 

 Bowbazar police have started a probe, said Ajay Ranade, deputy commissioner of police, central.

 The bar at the Ganesh Chandra Avenue-Central crossing had closed down around 11.30 pm, pulling down all shutters but one. Some employees were cleaning the kitchen and tables and some checking accounts when the man stormed in around 12.15.

 Paswan confronted him and was shot at, said a Bowbazar police station officer. 

 As the gunshot alerted everyone around, the youth called in two of his friends, who were waiting outside. In the melee that followed, another shot was fired in the air.

 Then the three sped off towards Bentinck Street. The bar men called the police and took Paswan to Medical College and Hospital, said the investigating officer.

 Suryalata was a gynae-cologist at the hospital. 

 The three bodies arrived by flight from Siliguri to Calcutta and were brought in a mini truck to Durgapur.

 Vasudevs father and elder brother reached the steel town from the US in the evening and decided to cremate them immediately. Most of their other relatives had arrived from Andhra Pradesh by then. 

 Colleagues poured in for a last look. K. Rambabu, a marketing executive with Alloy Steel Plant who is also from Andhra and a resident of Durgapur for years like Vasudev, said: Our fami- lies were together only last Tuesday. Picture by Manoj Giri

 Calcutta, April 2: As doctors wondered how to break the news of their parents death, Vasudev Kotras elder daughter recounted how her father parked his car on the edge of the road to capture Himalayan splendour on his handycam.

 Ananya said the Maruti Versa rolled down the crevice moments later. The assistant general manager of Durgapur Steel Plant had left for Sikkim with his family on Thursday and was travelling to Darjeeling from Pelling on Saturday afternoon when the holiday took a horrific turn. 

 Anu (Ananya) told me that her father had parked the car on the edge of the road towards the gorge and they were shooting on their handycam. Suddenly, the car slipped down the road and fell, said Ashish Kumar Chatterjee, the senior deputy director of the steel plant hospital who had been rushed to Sikkim to accompany the three children to Calcutta. 

 The 300-foot plunge to the bed of the trickling Rangit around 80 km from Gangtok killed 44-year-old Vasudev and his mother-in-law Thangirala on the spot. 

 Suryalata, also 44 and a gynaecologist with the steel plant hospital, died on the way to a hospital in south Sikkims Namchi.

 At Apollo Gleneagles Hospital in Calcutta, doctors said a CT scan revealed Ananyna has a mild internal haemorrhage and crack in the pelvic bone. 

 Aishwarya, 12, has a fracture in the left arm and cuts and bruises. She will undergo a surgery tomorrow. Aditya, 10, has a collar bone fracture. 

 All of them are conscious and stable, said V. Ramanan, the medical director. 

 The children do not know yet that they have been orphaned. 

 Doctor uncle, aap kyun aaye hai hame lene? (Why have you come to take us) Sach sa-ch bataaiye mummy-pappa ko kya hua! (Tell us the truth. What has happened to our parents)? Ananya had asked Chatterjee on the Jet Airways flight from Bagdogra. 

 When I evaded her question, she fell silent, Chatterjee said. Aishwarya and Aditya are too young to suspect anything yet. 

 My father has gone to rescue the car, Aditya told the nurses. 

 All three were laid on stretchers at the rear of the aircraft. The airline had ensured that there were no newspapers in that area. 

 The closest relative should break the news. The children would be traumatised but they can gradually overcome it with the familys support, said J. Ram, a consultant psychiatrist at the hospital. 

 With all family members busy with the funeral at Durgapur, only a cousin of Suryalata was at the hospital today. 

 Two of her colleagues, Monalisa Chatterjee and Mitali Pathak, stayed back. 

 Well stay with them till the other family members come, said Mitali.

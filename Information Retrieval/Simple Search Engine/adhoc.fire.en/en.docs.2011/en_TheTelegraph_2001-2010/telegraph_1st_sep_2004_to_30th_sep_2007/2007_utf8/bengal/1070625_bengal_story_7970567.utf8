The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Talks hint 

 Calcutta, June 24: The state Congress and Left Front partners have hinted that they want to revive the peace initiative in Nandigram. 

 The government had put the all-party talks on the backburner after Mamata Banerjee refused to accept the governments Singur package. 

 The state Congress today sent a letter to Forward Bloc veteran Ashok Ghosh asking him about the fate of the all-party meeting that he had convened on May 24 but later adjourned after Mamata stormed out. 

 The peace meet had ended in a stalemate as the CPM refused to describe the March 14 firing in Nandigram as genocide.

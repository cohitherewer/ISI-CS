 Haldia/Calcutta, May 21: Barely 48 hours before the peace talks on Nandigram, Mamata Banerjee struck a conciliatory note, saying she would welcome a chemical hub in neighbouring Haldia if it didnt come up at the cost of farmers.

 She told a rally in the port town she was keen on a consensus on the project, but she stuck to her guns on the acquisition of farmland probably to keep the audience fired up.

 The government has wri-tten to political parties that 62,000 acres will have to be acquired in Haldia and its adjoining areas for the chemical hub. The government wants to make this happen through a consensus. 

 We have no problem in reaching a consensus, but we are opposed to the acquisition of farmland for the hub. It cannot come up at the cost of the livelihood of farmers, the Trinamul Congress chief said.

 The venue of the gathering had been shifted to Haldia from Calcutta, apparently to show off Mamatas new-found clout among farmers in the region. And it was not low on rhetoric. The government has set its eyes on Haldia after killing farmers in Nandigram. What was the big hurry?

 The chemical hub, she added, could only be developed on land unfit for cultivation.

 Getting such a vast tract that is infertile is a tall order anywhere in south Bengal.

 Our agitation in Singur and Nandigram will continue. And the peace talks will also be held, Mamata said.

 An all-party meeting has been called in Calcutta on Thursday to discuss ways to restore peace and normality in Nandigram.

 Mamata told the rally she had four demands relating to Nandigram, but took pains to clarify that she was not setting terms for the talks. 

 She wants: 

 The March 14 massacre to be discussed 

 Punishment for those responsible for the deaths

 A CBI inquiry into the firing 

 Compensation for the victims families

 I dont want to attach preconditions to the peace talks. But the situation calls for wide-ranging discussions. I want the CBI to restart its inquiry. Why should the government oppose the resumption of the CBI probe? Mamata asked.

 She expressed surprise at the CIDs failure to file chargesheets against the 10 suspected members of the CPM armed brigade who were arrested from a Nandigram brick kiln. The CIDs lapses should be probed, she said.

 The Trinamul leader also wanted the Centre to do away with special economic zones altogether.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Browbeat bid over land bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 13: The land minister had to rush to leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjees office to pacify him after the CPMs Rabin Mondal told a select committee meeting today that his party knew how to get the rural land ceiling bill passed by the Left Front.

 You can object to the amendments but we know how to get them cleared by the front, Mondal said. 

 Embarrassed, Abdur Rezzak Mollah, also chairman of the committee scrutinising the bill, walked into Chatterjees chamber after the meeting and said: Parthababu, please keep your cool. I dont support remarks that amount to threats. I believe everything can be solved through discussions and the Left Front will be debating the bill in detail.

 The minister was in Chatterjees chamber for about 10 minutes and had a cup of tea.

 At the select committee meeting, Chatterjee and his Trinamul colleague Subrata Bakshi asked Mondal: Do you need to issue threats to get the bill passed? Why are you dra- gging the fronts name into the meeting of an Assembly committee? This committee is going to have the final word on the report to be framed.

 Front chief Biman Bose had said a few days ago that the differences would be resolved through talks with allies.

 Todays meeting was inconclusive. 

 Trinamul, the Congress and the front partners objected to the amendments on two counts. 

 First, they felt that relaxation of the 17-acre ceiling on irrigated land and 24-acre on non-irrigated land would lead to land grabbing and, second, allowing sharecroppers to sell half their land would defeat the purpose of land reforms.

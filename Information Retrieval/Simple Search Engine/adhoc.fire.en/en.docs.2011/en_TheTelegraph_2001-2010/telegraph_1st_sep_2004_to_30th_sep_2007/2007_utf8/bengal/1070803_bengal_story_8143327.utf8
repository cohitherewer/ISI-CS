The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Public transport kept out of strike

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 2: Citu today said public transport, hospitals, ambulances, chemists, power and water supply and newspaper offices would not be affected by Wednesdays nation-wide strike in the unorganised sector. 

 The Left-sponsored general strike has been called to press for implementing the demands of employees of 55 unorganised industries. They include real estate workers, those engaged in non-farming jobs in rural areas, bidi makers and self-employed people like vendors, tailors, book binders and printing press staff.

 These lakhs of workers have been denied basic rights like minimum wages, eight-hour working time, maternity benefits as well as social securities like ESI, provident fund and gratuity, state Citu secretary Kali Ghosh said. 

 However, we have decided to exempt certain services as we dont want a general strike-like situation here, he added, indicating that the CPMs trade wing would not like to spark a public furore and embarrass the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government. 

 According to Ghosh, buses, including school buses, and chartered vehicles would be exempt from the strike. Railway services, too, are unlikely to be affected. 

 Small shops employing less than 20 people would have to down shutters and private security agencies may find it difficult to deploy personnel.

 According to Citu insiders, newspaper vendors had not been on the list of those exempt from the strike initially but were later included following the intervention of Left Front chairman and CPM state secretary Biman Bose.

 Bose in a statement today supported the strike but appealed to the West Bengal Newspaper Sellers Samiti not to join it in public interest. 

 Although newspaper vendors are not direct employees of the newspaper industry, its products reach readers through them. We support your demands. But the industry is included in the list of essential services and kept out of the ambit of general strikes. So I appeal to you not to join the strike while supporting it, he said.

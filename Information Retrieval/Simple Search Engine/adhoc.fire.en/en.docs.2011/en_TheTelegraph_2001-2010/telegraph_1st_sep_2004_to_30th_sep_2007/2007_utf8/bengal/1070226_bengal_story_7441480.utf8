 Land laws on study table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 25: To put up an argument against the Left Front partners who have been stubborn in their opposition to the proposal to relax the land ceiling, the government is studying the laws in 11 other states. 

 The CPM still hopes to convince its allies of the need to relax the ceiling for infrastructure and commercial projects and biotech and infotech parks. It also feels the need to introduce some safeguards in the Land Reforms (Amendment) Bill, 2006, before tabling it in the Assembly. 

 Land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah has been asked to prepare a note on the bill and circulate it among the recalcitrant allies before a fresh round of talks in the Left Front. The study of the other states laws is part of that exercise, an official said. 

 CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar admitted the possibility of misusing the land ceiling relaxation and the proposed investors right to sell land acquired for industries. 

 Land for industrialisation is a must. But we are disc- ussing safeguards to prevent the misuse of the amendments. These would be incorporated in the bill, he said. 

 Land ceiling and related laws of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Ma-dhya Pradesh, Orissa, Bihar and Chhattisgarh are now being looked into, said an official.

 Although the study is at an early stage, the official said Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Gujarat have no ceiling on holding non-agricultural land. The governments in these states do not require any legal change to allow investors to set up industrial projects on non-farm plots. 

 Four years after coming to power in 1977, the Left Front government changed the land reforms law of the 1950s and capped the right to hold any land agricultural, non-agricultural or wasteland.

 The priority then was land reforms and recovery of benaami land (recorded in the name of non-existent kin), a land and land reforms official said. 

 However, many officials felt that it would be difficult for the government to get the entire non-agricultural rural land removed from the purview of the ceiling for its potential political consequences.

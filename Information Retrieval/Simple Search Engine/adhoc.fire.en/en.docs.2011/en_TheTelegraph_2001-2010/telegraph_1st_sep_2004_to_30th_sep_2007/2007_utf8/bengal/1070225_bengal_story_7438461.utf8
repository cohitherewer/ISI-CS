 Calcutta, Feb. 24: The Narcotics Control Bureau today raided a storeroom in Howrah owned by the family of Sanjay Kedia, the Xponse CEO who was arrested on the charge of running a drugs racket in the US through his call centre in Salt Lakes Sector V. 

 The officers found some packets wrapped in clothes, but did not open them as Kedias family could not be contacted. 

 We did not touch any article kept in the storeroom because none of the Kedia family members could be contacted. There was no one at their Salt Lake apartment. We have pasted a notice outside their house asking them to contact us as early as possible. We want to examine the packets in front of them, said Sandeep Mittal, the eastern zone director of the bureau.

 The officers left after sealing the place.

 The sleuths came to know about the storeroom, at Sankrail in Howrah, while examining documents seized from Kedias office and home. 

 One of the papers indicated that the storeroom, located on the ground floor of a building, was bought in the name of Kedias father, Dwarkaprasad. Officers immediately tried to contact Kedias family members. When a team visited their Salt Lake residence, no one was home. His wife Monica is absconding, Mittal said.

 A team of five officers then went to the Sankrail storeroom and broke open the lock.

 Kedia, the head of Xponse IT Services and Xponse Technologies in Sector V, had been picked up on February 12.

 Investigations revealed that Kedia had made over Rs 2 crore a month by selling online fake prescriptions of drugs to thousands of addicts, most of them Americans. He also had clients in Canada and Sweden.

 The police found Rs 1.7 crore deposited in Kedias 14 bank accounts across the country. The 31-year-old IIT Delhi alumnus had also opened an account with a Luxembourg bank under a fictitious name and deposited $10 million (about Rs 44 crore).

 If the Kedia family does not respond to the notice, we will go to the storeroom again and examine the packets, said an official of the narcotics bureau.

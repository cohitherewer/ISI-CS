 Cat and mouse in Singur replay

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Singur, May 21: Trinamul Congress supporters again tried to damage the wall around the Tata Motors site this afternoon and police had to lob tear gas shells and threaten to fire to shoo them away.

 Around 200 people who assembled in a playground near Kamarkundu to protest against yesterdays police action apparently turned violent as it began to rain. 

 Led by Save Farmland Committee leader Becharam Manna, they were marching through the villages. But they took to the fields as it started pouring and headed straight to the wall at Bajemelia, where they clashed with the police yesterday said Priyabrata Bakshi, the officer in charge of Singur police station. 

 The protesters hurled stones when around 1,500 police and paramilitary personnel, who were there since yesterday, intercepted them. 

 Circle inspector, headquarters, Satyacharan Dutta had to be admitted to the Chinsurah Imambara Hospital with head injuries.

 We used tear gas to ward off the demonstrators, but that proved insufficient as it was raining hard and some of our men were injured in the melee. Then we flashed our arms and threatened to fire and the protesters fled, Bakshi said.

 Home secretary P.R. Ray said the police pushed the mob back from the wall.

 Manna alleged that the police fired in the air to disperse them. Many women and children were taken ill as the tear gas shells landed on rooftops. Mahadeb Kole of Uttar Bajemelia had to hospitalise his five-year-old son. Our protests will continue, he said.

 Non-bailable warrants have been issued against 61 people, including Manna, Trinamul MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya and social activist Anuradha Talwar, for yesterdays attack. A woman constable was assaulted and a policeman was hit with a dagger by the Save Farmland supporters.

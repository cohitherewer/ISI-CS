The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Apex court stay in Oxytown case

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 29: The Supreme Court today stayed the arrest of Laxmi Narayan Chakraborty, the tutor accused of eliminating the family of a student with whom he allegedly had a relationship. 

 A married man, Chakraborty was accused of hiring Chandan Das in 1999 to kill Bidyut Kumar Pal, his wife and two daughters after they pressured him to marry Sohini, who was pregnant. 

 On Monday, the apex court asked police not to arrest Das for four weeks and issued a notice to the Bengal government. 

 In petitions filed through counsel Abhijit Sengupta, both accused challenged the August 6 Calcutta High Court order for their arrest and custody till the states appeal against their acquittal was decided.

 A two-judge bench of the apex court said the high court had exceeded its jurisdiction in passing such an order. Well lay down the law regarding Section 390 of the CrPC, Justices C.K. Thakker and Markandey Katju said. 

 Section 390 permits a high court to either send a person to jail or release him on bail once an appeal is filed against his acquittal. 

 Chakraborty had challenged the high court order on the ground that he was not heard. He also said he was the only breadwinner in his family. 

 On March 29, the trial court had said the two were in no way linked beyond reasonable doubts with the accusation.

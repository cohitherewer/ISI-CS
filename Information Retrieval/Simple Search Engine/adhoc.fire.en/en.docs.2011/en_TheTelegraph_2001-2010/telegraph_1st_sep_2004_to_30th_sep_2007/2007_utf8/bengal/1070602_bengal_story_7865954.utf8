 Calcutta, June 1: 

 He battled poverty to become the Madhyamik topper from north 

 Bengal. Today, Arif Sheikh earned another reward when Buddhadeb 

 Bhattacharjee promised to fund his education.

 The 16-year-old from Murshidabad, whose farmer-father died when he was two, could not afford to go to school till the Al Ameen Mission, a charitable madarsa, took him under its wings. He later moved to a South Dinajpur school.

 The boy, who studied 19 hours a day, has got 795 out of 800 the highest in the state.

 Around 11.30 am, the teenager was ushered into the chief ministers chamber at Writers Buildings. 

 During the 30-minute meeting, Bhattacharjee gave him a bouquet and a pen and asked: What are your plans? 

 Sir, I want to become a doctor. I want to do research, he replied.

 Bhattacharjee then told Arif the state would sponsor his education.

 I had seen him on TV. But after meeting him, I feel inspired. Hes a simple man, Arif said.

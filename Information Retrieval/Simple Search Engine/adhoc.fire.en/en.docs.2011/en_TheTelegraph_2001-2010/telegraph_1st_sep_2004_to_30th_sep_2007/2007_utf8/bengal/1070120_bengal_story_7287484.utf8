 HC raps cops for lax judge shield

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 19: The high court today came down heavily on state police for their failure in providing protection to the judges of the Jalpaiguri court who could not join duty for a month because of an agitation by advocates, political parties and others.

 The court delivered the rebuke in the presence of director-general of police A.B. Vohra, the district magistrate, the superintendent of police, the sub-divisional police officer and the officer in-charge of Kotwali police station of Jalpaiguri.

 A division bench of acting Chief Justice B. Bhattacharya and Justice K.K. Prasad said the police had violated the Constitution by not taking into account the FIR lodged by a district judge who was prevented from entering the court.

 The act of the police is unpardonable.... The constitutional machinery has failed in case of Jalpaiguri, the judges told the officials and asked them to appear again on January 29. Come to us with affidavits stating why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against you.

 Earlier this week, Justice Bhattacharya had issued a suo motu contempt notice against the police officials and those said to be on strike. He demanded a date when the circuit bench of the high court would start functioning there.

 It is matter of surprise that even after the district judge informed the police that the agitators had been preventing him from joining duty, the Kotwali police did not take any step. Mind that a district judges information is more than a FIR, the judge told the police.

 Advocate-general Balai Ray tried to defend the police, but the court wondered what the police would do if the chief minister was prevented from entering Writers Buildings.

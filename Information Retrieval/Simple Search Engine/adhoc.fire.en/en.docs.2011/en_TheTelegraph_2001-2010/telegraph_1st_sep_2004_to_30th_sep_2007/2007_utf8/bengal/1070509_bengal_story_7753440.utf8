The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Court scan on lock-ups

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 8: The high court today expressed surprise on hearing that police do not serve water and food to undertrials in court lock-ups.

 The government has been told to inform the court whether that is the practice.

 The court started a suo motu case after an NGO brought to its notice the plight of those inside court lock-ups.

 Govinda Saha of Howrah, who was held in December for enforcing a bandh, was not provided food or water in the eight hours that he spent in the court lock-up, Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha pointed out.

 Its director wrote to the chief justice that it was the norm across the state.

 In August 2002, two undertrials died inside a crammed Malda court lock-up allegedly after not being provided water despite requests.

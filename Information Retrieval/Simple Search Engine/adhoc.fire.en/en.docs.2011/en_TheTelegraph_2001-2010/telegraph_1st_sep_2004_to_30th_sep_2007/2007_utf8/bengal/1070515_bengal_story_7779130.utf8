 Suri, May 14: The polytechnic student who went missing on Friday had climbed down a drainpipe and fled hostel to escape torture by his seniors.

 Police found Sarojit Biswas at a friends house in Suri town last night. 

 My seniors had asked me to inhale cigarette smoke. When I refused, they beat me up and scalded me with cigarette butts. They banged my head against the wall until I started bleeding. Fearing more torture, I fled after dinner on Friday, the first-year civil engineering student of Ramakrishna Shilpa Vidyapith said. 

 Still in shock, Sarojit has decided to quit the college. His cousin Pankaj, a first-year electrical engineering student in the same institution, said he would do the same. Pankaj is scared that he could have to bear the brunt of the seniors retaliation if some of their mates are punished. 

 The boys, who had got first-division marks in their HS, were to sit for their second semester exams in June.

 Our family doesnt want them to study in a college where juniors are ragged and the authorities turn a blind eye to such ugly incidents, Sarojits elder brother Bipan said before leaving for home, at Thak- urnagar, North 24-Parganas. 

 Bipan came here yesterday after being informed about Sarojits disappearance. 

 Sarojit said he boarded a truck after sneaking out of the hostel on Friday and spent the night in a dhaba at Mohammed Bazaar, 20 km away. 

 He went to a friends house in Bolpur on Saturday and came to another friends in Suri yesterday. The police found him there.

 The 20-year-old, a retired government employees son, didnt call home after leaving hostel because he was not sure how the family would take it.

 The police sent Sarojit who made the torture charge against his seniors and recounted his escape before the officiating chief judicial magistrate of Bolpur today to a doctor for tests to confirm the injuries inflicted on him.

 Birbhum superintendent S.S. Panda said the police would act against the six seniors accused of ragging after getting the medical report. 

 Thirty-three first-year students of the college met Panda yesterday to inform him that Sarojit used to be ragged regularly. The police have refused to disclose the identities of the alleged culprits and whether some of the other junior students had also been victimised.

 The UGC says a student found guilty of ragging should be expelled. Acting on a Supreme Court order and a UGC directive, the Bengal government has banned ragging in all educational institutions. 

 The state-run colleges officer-in-charge, Ali Haider, said a seven-member panel has been formed to probe the allegations. I have got six names, he said.

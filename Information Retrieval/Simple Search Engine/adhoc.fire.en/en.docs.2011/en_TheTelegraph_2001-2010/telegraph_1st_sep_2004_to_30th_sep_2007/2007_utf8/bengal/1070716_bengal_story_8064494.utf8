 Sound of Music comes to the hills

 Darjeeling, July 15: The hills came alive with the sound of music last evening as Mount Hermon produced its very own Von Trapp family and two Marias.

 At the 112-year-old Darjeeling school, Nikita Rai and Kunga Barphungpa played the young postulant-turned-governess for Captain Von Trapps seven troublesome children in two shows. Not because one of them was missing on a particular day, but because the school had two good singers to flaunt.

 Mount Hermon chose The Sound of Music as its main production for this years annual show. 

 The 85-member cast was handed the script for the three-hour musical exactly a month before the first performance. 

 We actually wanted the show in September but it so happened that we had to do it now and it was now or never, said M. Coutinho, one of the three directors.

 Nikita, Kunga, Sandeep Tuladhar (who played Von Trapp alternating shows with Salome Yonzone) and their friends had the town enthralled. But the scene-stealer was Risynda Mena, a Class III student, who played the mischievous Gretl. 

 Santosh Rijal, an alumnus who came all the way from Nepal, was impressed. I couldnt resist the temptation of watching it. The journey was worth it.

 Nepal stop in kidnap trail

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Patna, May 5: The abductors of Tahir Khurshid, the son of a Calcutta leather merchant, had planned to hand him over to gangsters in Bihar who would have taken him to Nepal and negotiated a hefty ransom, police said today.

 The London-educated Tahir, 24, was kidnapped at gunpoint yesterday and whisked away in his car. He was rescued from Bettiah on the Bihar-Nepal border within 24 hours.

 The leader of the gang, which is active across Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, had reached Bettiah yesterday. He was waiting at a petrol pump for the kidnappers.

 A team of Calcutta police left for Bettiah after interrogating Raju Mohammad Tabrez, whose arrest had led to Tahirs rescue.

 Tabrez is an aide of Tahirs cousin Mohammad Nadeem, who is accused of plotting the kidnapping. He had recently lost his job in a tannery.

 They had planned to leave Tahirs car in Bettiah and go to a remote village on motorcycles. The hideout was kept ready by gang leader Munna Singh. From there they planned to go to Nepal, said an officer.

 Tabrez was coordinating with Munna.

 Nadeem and his associates, Tanveer Alam and Raju Tiwari, have been arrested.

 The three today revealed during interrogation that through their journey, Nadeem pretended that he, too, had been kidnapped.

 Although Nadeem was driving the car, he acted as if he was doing it on the abductors orders, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of Calcutta polices detective department.

 All these plans were chalked out at least 10 days ago, Singh added.

 The three will be produced in court on Sunday, Bachchu Singh Mina, the superintendent of police, West Champaran, said. 

 Calcutta police are expecting the accused to be handed over to them.

 Tahir will be brought to the city tomorrow.

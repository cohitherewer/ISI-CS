The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 At Kalis feet, after close shave

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Pranab Mukherjee

 Krishnagar, June 10: Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee today lay on his tummy in front of Goddess Kali in a Nadia temple, apparently to thank her for a piece of good fortune.

 On his way to Behrampore on a scorching afternoon, Mukherjee ordered his chauffeur to a stop at Bethuadahari, where a truck had rammed into his Ambassador on an April night.

 He stepped out and asked for a Kali temple. And, as luck would have it, there was one a stones throw away.

 After waiting for about five minutes in a Congress office, as the priest arranged his offering of flowers and sandesh, Mukherjee stepped into the temple and hit the ground straight away for a shashtanga pranam.

 The priest started chanting mantras. Back on his feet and with folded hands, Mukherjee joined it. 

 After the ceremony, he came out with the sweetmeats prasad one of which went into his mouth and the others to party workers.

 On April 7, the lorry coming from the opposite direc- tion had swerved out of con- trol after a tyre puncture and hit Mukherjees car about 130 km from Calcutta. He needed 15 stitches on the head but the injury could have been much worse.

 In a thanksgiving speech today, Mukherjee, however, confined himself to praising the local people and the doctors who treated him. 

 I dont remember in de- tail what happened that night. But I remember the local people took me to the hospital. Im grateful to them and to the doctors, he said.

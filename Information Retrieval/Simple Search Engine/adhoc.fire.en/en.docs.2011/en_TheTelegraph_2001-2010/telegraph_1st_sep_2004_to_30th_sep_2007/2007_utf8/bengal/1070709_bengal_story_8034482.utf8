 Alipurduar, July 8: The death of a Royal Bengal tiger here has brought to light the plight of the remaining 12 rescued from circus and now caged at a centre. 

 Like the one that died, five are suffering from tuberculosis. They are yet to be prescribed any medicine. 

 The tigers death last week was not disclosed by the rescue centre authorities, who refused to speak, but the Cooch Behar divisional forest officer (DFO) and forest minister Ananta Roy admitted it. 

 Blood samples of the diseased tigers have been sent to Hyderabads Bhimta Laboratories, which will advise the centre on their medication.

 The tigers were diagnosed with TB in mid-June. The rescue centre desperately needs is a full-time vet, said M.C. Biswas, the DFO.

 The veterinary surgeon of Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary visits the centre about 16km away every week.

 Of the 18 tigers brought there in November 2005, four were sent to Darjeeling. 

 One of the tigers sent to the hills died of old age. The others are fine, said A.K. Jha, the director of the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park, which has a full-time vet.

 After the Supreme Court banned performances by animals, 18 tigers were seized from Nataraj, Olympic and Famous circuses. 

 In 2004, the Central Zoo Authority gave the nod to the first tiger rehabilitation centre in the country at South Khayerbari, Alipurduar. The animals were shifted there in 2005. 

 The authority had sanctioned Rs 40 lakh for the project. It was expected that a veterinary surgeon would be appointed and a clinic set up for the tigers and six leopards. During a visit last year, the chief minister announced the setting up of an animal hospital nearby, but work on that is yet to start. 

 The forest minister today blamed the circuses for the tigers death.

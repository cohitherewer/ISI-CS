 CBI files Singur charges 

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 15: The CBI filed chargesheets in the Tapasi Malik murder case today, but did not slap the rape charge on CPM supporter Debu Malik.

 The charges submitted before the Chandernagore additional chief judicial magistrate said Malik was only involved in the murder of the 17-year-old anti-acquisition activist.

 Her charred body was found on the Tata Motors plot in Singur on December 18.

 The CBI had earlier said Debu had also raped Tapasi.

 CPM leader Surhid Dutta was charged with plotting the murder and hiring the killers. Debu Malik was present when Tapasi was raped and killed. After raping her, the killers hit Tapasi to make her unconscious. They dumped her in a pit, poured fuel and set her on fire, CBI deputy superintendent Partha Sarathi Basu said.

 Dutta and Debu are in jail. The four killers are missing.

 Appeal to farmers

 Industries minister Nirupam Sen today appealed to farmers in Singur not to oppose the Tata project, but train children to become capable of getting jobs. Mofussil Singur will become a mini city because of the plant, he told a rally.

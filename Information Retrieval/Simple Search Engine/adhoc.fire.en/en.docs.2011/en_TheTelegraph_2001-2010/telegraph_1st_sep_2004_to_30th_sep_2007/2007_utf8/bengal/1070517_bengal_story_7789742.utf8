 Kshiti in dock over jobs

 Calcutta, May 16: The high court today asked PWD minister Kshiti Goswami to explain why contempt proceedings should not be drawn against him for recruiting candidates of his choice instead of those empanelled for a job. 

 The court had earlier quashed the PWDs decision to appoint 23 minister-sponsored candidates in Group D posts. 

 The division bench of Justices B. Bhattacharya and K.K. Prasad also showcaused chief secretary A.K. Deb and PWD secretary K. Swati Bhasan. 

 A panel of 254 was drawn up in 1993, but 23 others were recruited. The state administrative tribunal set aside the ministers order on a petition from eight people. The government challenged the order, but lost in the high court. 

 The contempt plea was moved when the government did not recruit the empanelled candidates even after that.

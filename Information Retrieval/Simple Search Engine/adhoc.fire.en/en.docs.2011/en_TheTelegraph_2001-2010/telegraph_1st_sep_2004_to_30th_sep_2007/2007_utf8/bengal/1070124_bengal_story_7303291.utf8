The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cancer funds flow for fraud

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Jan. 23: Saurav Chakraborty, a third-year student and a scientists son, allegedly raised about Rs 50,000 over the past year posing as a cancer patient who didnt have the money for treatment.

 He was held last night. 

 Police said the Bengali (honours) student had scored over 80 per cent in his CBSE plus two examination. 

 Saurav told people he was an orphan who had studied at Doon School, where ragging led to a wound in the leg, which developed cancer later. He swathed his right leg in bandages and showed it to the people. He was a smooth talker and people believed him and donated handsomely, said North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar.

 Many schools and colleges in Kanchrapara, Kalyani, Ranaghat and Krishnagar had organised fund-raisers for him. 

 Last evening, he met some students of Kanchrapara College, who had given him Rs 10,000 earlier and were about to hand over Rs 70,000 more that they had raised for his treatment in Mumbai.

 We were moved by his plight and wanted to visit his house in Kanchrapara town, where he apparently lived with grandfather Dulal Pathak. When we asked him to take us home, he told us that the old man didnt know about his illness and would be shocked to hear about it, said Binita Das, a third-year student. 

 Binita and her classmates met Pathak, 70, yesterday, assuring Saurav that they wouldnt tell him about his illness. During the conversation, Pathak told them that Saurav was a student like them and his father was a scientist. 

 We were shocked, said Binitas classmate Dipankar.

 Realising that they had been taken for a ride, the students cornered Saurav in a room and raised an alarm. 

 A bewildered Pathak called up Sauravs parents at their home in Kalyani. 

 Both came over to Kanchrapara, as did the police, whom the students had called.

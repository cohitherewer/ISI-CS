The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Singur affidavit incomplete

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 2: The high court today said the affidavit submitted by the government on the Singur land acquisition process was incomplete.

 The government now has to furnish a fresh affidavit by June 5, giving details on the disbursement of compensation to landowners such as the serial numbers of cheques issued and their dates and the rule under which the payment was made. 

 On February 23, the court asked the government to detail the modes of payment made to those who sold their land for the Tata Motors project, about 40 km from Calcutta. The order followed a petition by Jaydeep Mukherjee, a social worker, challenging the legality of the process adopted by the state while acquiring the land.

 The petitioners lawyers said the government took over the land under two different rules of the acquisition act, which the law does not permit.

 The advocate-general said the government did not furnish the details because it had challenged the maintainability of the petitions.

 Dankuni, Jan. 28: Trinamul Congress workers planning a march to Singur were today stopped at Maitipara, the spot where a similar obstruction of Mamata Banerjees motorcade two months ago had sparked vandalism in the Assembly.

 The action this time was limited: the Trinamul supporters attacked with stones and the police replied with a baton-charge and tear gas. But party womens wing chief Kakali Ghosh Dastidar tried to do a Mamata by getting into an argument with senior officers and later alleging she was roughed up by policewomen.

 As news of the trouble spread, some 500 villagers in Singur ran to the Tata Motors small-car project site and, for the fourth time in just over a week, tried to torch the fence posts. They were driven away by the police.

 Earlier, around 2 pm, a Trinamul crowd of about 1,000 had gathered at Maitipara, near the Dankuni toll plaza and about 20 km from Calcutta.

 When the police blocked their way, an argumentative Ghosh Dastidar asked why they were being stopped 25 km away from Singur, where prohibitory orders were in force.

 Soon, stones and bricks were flying, prompting the police to use water canons and then their batons. Finally, they lobbed 17 tear gas shells.

 About 10 policewomen pounced on me, Ghosh Dastidar said, adding that she had received neck injuries.

 Arun Gupta, inspector-general (western range), denied the allegation. The officer, assigned to oversee law and order at Maitipara, said: The police were attacked and had no choice but to do a lathicharge and lob tear gas shells. Eleven policemen were injured, some of them seriously.

 Elsewhere in the district, a former party MP felt the heat of Trinamul anger. Sudip Bandopadhyay, who had defected to the Congress in 2004, said he was gheraoed at Nalikul in Hooghly where another group of Trinamul workers had gathered for a march to Singur.

 Bandopadhyay, returning to Calcutta from a mass wedding at Tarakeswar, said he was abused and asked to explain his partys bonhomie with the CPM in Delhi while it seemed to oppose Left policies in Bengal. He said they wouldnt let his car through, forcing him into a detour.

 The mob that attacked the Tata Motors fence came from the Bajemelia and Gopalnagar-Ghoshpara villages, about 50 km from Calcutta, and was led by Becharam Manna, convener of the Krishi Jomi Raksha Committee.

 After being beaten back by four rounds of tear gas, the protesters squatted on the tracks at the nearby Mudhusudanpur railway station for over an hour.

 Trinamul gatherings broke up without much trouble at three other places Baidyabati-Chowrasta, Maheswarpur and Nanikul. At Maheswarpur, 55 km from Calcutta, some Trinamul workers blocked the Durgapur Expressway for over two hours after being stopped on their way to Singur.

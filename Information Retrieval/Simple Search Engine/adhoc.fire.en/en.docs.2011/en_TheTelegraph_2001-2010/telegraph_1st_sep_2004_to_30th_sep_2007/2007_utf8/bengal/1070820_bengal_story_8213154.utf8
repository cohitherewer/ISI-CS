The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 1965 war hero gets his dues

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 The Telegraph report on Atul Haldar

 Krishnagar, Aug. 19: The 78-year-old was surprised to see the official-looking white Ambassador halt in front of his crumbling hut.

 Are you Atul Haldar? asked the man who stepped out. Are you the Atul Haldar who won the Ashoka Chakra in 1965 for braving the raging Ichhamati and rescuing 150 soldiers?

 The aged fisherman went into his hut and returned with the bronze medal, now called Shaurya Chakra. 

 This is yours, the officer said, handing Haldar Rs 1,500 his war heros pension, unpaid for two years. 

 The unlettered war heros monthly entitlement of Rs 100 was stopped two years ago because a babu in faraway Delhi had suddenly made a bank account mandatory.

 To rustle up the Rs 500 required to open an account was a tall order for the resident of Majdia, about 120km from Calcutta. Haldar lived on Rs 10 a day provided by his four sons.

 The Telegraph had reported his plight and the Nadia administrations failure to help the national hero get his dues. The report jolted the government, and chief secretary A.K. Deb sought a report from district magistrate Onkar Singh Meena. 

 The DM ordered an inquiry, which revealed that the administration had not sent Haldars papers to Delhi.

 District treasury officer Bijoy Das landed in Haldars house after that.

 Haldar had got the Class III Ashoka Chakra for valour, courageous action or self-sacrifice while not engaged in direct action with the enemy.

 Its a shame that we made him starve. Hes the pride of our district, Meena said.

 Over the years, Haldars pension had gone up to Rs 100 a month from Rs 15, but he still couldnt afford a bank account. He wrote several letters, in vain. No one had time for the man rendered jobless by age.

 On September 18, 1965, Haldar and his father were preparing to cast their fish net when he heard the drone of a mechanised boat. Through sheets of rain, he saw a vessel crossing the Ichhamati from Kusthia in erstwhile East Pakistan. As it came closer, he saw it capsize. 

 The river was over 20ft deep and the jawans were screaming for help. Haldar jumped into the river and his father cast his net. Together, they pulled 150 jawans to the bank. 

 He dived several times in the river and recovered much of the lost ammunition.... He continued his efforts the next morning and ultimately recovered almost all that we had lost. The skill and courage displayed... was highly commendable, the Union home secretary wrote on August 12, 1966.

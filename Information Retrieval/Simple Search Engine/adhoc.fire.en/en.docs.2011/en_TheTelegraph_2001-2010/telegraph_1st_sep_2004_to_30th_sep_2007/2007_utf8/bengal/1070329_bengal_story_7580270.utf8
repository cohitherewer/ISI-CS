 Explosives on local train

 OUR BUREAU 

 New target?

 Calcutta, March 28: A group of cleaners today stumbled on explosives on a local train at the Panskura railway yard in East Midnapore.

 The Railway Protection Force (RPF), whom the cleaners called, also found pieces of paper with Maobadi Zindabad scribbled on them and rough sketches of maps. 

 One of the maps was labelled Farakka Barrage.

 This is the second time in a month that explosives have been found in a local train. On March 10, the Howrah-Gurap local had a close shave when a crude bomb with a timer was detected in a packed compartment minutes before its scheduled departure.

 The RPF has begun a joint probe with the CID to find out if there is a link between the two incidents.

 Forensic experts said while the explosives found in the Howrah-Panskura local were not of high quality, they could have caused serious damage as there was a bottle of petrol next to the aluminium box in which the explosives had been kept.

 The petrol would have helped the fire caused by the explosion to spread. Just one set of such explosives with petrol is enough to burn a few bogies, said an expert. The material contained heavy doses of sulphur, potassium nitrate and charcoal, and all this with petrol make a sure recipe for disaster.

 According to railway security officials, the Panskura-Howrah local entered the Panskura car shed, 75 km from here, around 9.40 last night and was scheduled to leave for Howrah at 3 this morning. 

 A little past midnight, workers cleaning the train spotted a plastic bag under a seat with two wires sticking out. They threw away the bag and informed the RPF.

 The GRP (Government Railway Police) found the bag lying between tracks 10 and 11. It contained an aluminium box and a pair of surgical gloves. The entire area was cordoned off with sandbags. The CID headquarters in Calcutta was informed, and around 11 am the explosives were defused, said A.N. Sinha, senior security commissioner of South Eastern Railways. 

 CID officers said a timer was attached to the aluminium box.

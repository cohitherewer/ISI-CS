 Pandua (Hooghly), Aug. 2: The block medical officer of Pandua began an indefinite hunger strike at the hospital here to protest against corruption in health services.

 Gauranga Sundar Jana said he was being victimised by district health authorities as he had taken action against doctors who would often skip work at the six primary health centres in Pandua, 70 km from Calcutta.

 These doctors would come to the health centres for only two hours a day when they are supposed to be available 24 hours, the block medical officer (BMO), who joined the hospital in October 2005, said.

 The doctors are supposed to stay in quarters on the hospital premises. If there are no quarters available, they are to rent houses within 3km of the hospital. But these doctors come from far-off places and are always in a hurry to return home, the BMO alleged.

 Jana said the district authorities began targeting him after he took action against four doctors since October. 

 Within four months since March this year, I have been transferred thrice. I was not allowed to work peacefully. So I moved the state administrative tribunal. I won the case in June and was reinstated as Pandua BMO, Jana said.

 I was again transferred, but this time with a promotion as assistant CMOH (chief medical officer of health) in Burdwan. But I am not getting the release order. This amounts to harassment.

 The chief medical officer, however, said the doctor was not accepting his release order. We sent his release order on June 28.

 The CMOH charged Jana with misappropriating funds worth Rs 2 lakh. That is why he is staging the hunger strike drama, he said.

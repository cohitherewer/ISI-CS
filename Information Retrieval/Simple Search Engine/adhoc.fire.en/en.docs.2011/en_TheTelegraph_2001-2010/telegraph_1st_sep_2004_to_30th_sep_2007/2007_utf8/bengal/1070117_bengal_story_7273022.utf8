Singur, Jan. 16: A few thousand Trinamul Congress supporters today held a peaceful rally on the fringes of Singur to ensure prohibitory orders were not violated but two of their leaders rode to the Tata site on a motorcycle and uprooted a part of the fence.

 The supporters did not follow Paresh Pal and Sanjay Bakshi under instructions from Mamata Banerjee, but all of them wanted to court arrest.

 The police did not have the means to take so many people into custody. So, an executive magistrate and the officers in charge of Singur and Chanditala police stations climbed on to a dais and announced: We declare 20,000 people arrested and respectfully released.

 The party had earlier announced a law violation programme in Singur. Asked why it backtracked, general secretary Madan Mitra said: Mamata Banerjee doesnt want violence. 

 Although led by deputy inspector-general Anuj Sharma and Hooghly police chief Supratim Sarkar, and armed with water cannons, the force was outnumbered with thousands threatening to move into Singur, separated by a narrow road from Chanditala. 

 Please tell the leaders that it would be better if a confrontation can be avoided. A party can demonstrate but let law and order prevail, district magistrate Binod Kumar was heard telling the police bosses.

 MLA Partha Chatterjee spoke to Mamata and told the crowd that she would carry forward the agitation. Nothing that can cause bloodshed should be done. Keep in mind that you all will have to follow Mamata Banerjees orders.

 When the workers had been pacified and the deal with the police was being struck, Pal and Bakshi sneaked into Singur.

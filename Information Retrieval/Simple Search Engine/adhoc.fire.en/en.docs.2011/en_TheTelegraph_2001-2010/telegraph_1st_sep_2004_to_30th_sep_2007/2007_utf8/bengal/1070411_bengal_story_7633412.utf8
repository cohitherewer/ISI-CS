 Calcutta, April 10: The high court today summoned a senior police officer for allegedly failing to ensure that those eager to ignore an ongoing strike at Hind Motors can work as usual.

 Around the time the court was calling the Serampore subdivisional police officer for an explanation, the gates of the Uttarpara factory erupted again on the 29th day of the strike.

 The police had to wield the baton as members of the striking Sangrami Shramik Karmachari Union again prevented Citu supporters from going to work.

 The striking workers hurled stones at the police and members of the management. 

 Ten people, including manager Debashis Mukherjee and deputy magistrate Gautam Chatterjee, were injured. 

 A police picket was posted near the factory, which has witnessed frequent clashes between the two groups of workers.

 The court asked subdivisional police officer Ajay Thakur to appear before it on April 17. He has to clarify why he failed to carry out an earlier order asking the police to provide security to employees willing to join duty. Representatives of the state and Hooghly police chiefs were also told to be present in court that day.

 Justice Dipankar Dutta asked a leader of the striking union to clarify why it was preventing employees from joining work. 

 The Hind Motors management had moved a contempt petition against the police and the union, for their failure to comply with the earlier order.

 The court had asked the police to provide security to the employees who were not responding to the strike call and asked the union not to prevent willing employees from working, said Kishore Dutta, the companys lawyer. 

 A small group of workers is harassing over 2,100 employees reporting for duty everyday and preventing over 1,000 others from joining duty, the company said.

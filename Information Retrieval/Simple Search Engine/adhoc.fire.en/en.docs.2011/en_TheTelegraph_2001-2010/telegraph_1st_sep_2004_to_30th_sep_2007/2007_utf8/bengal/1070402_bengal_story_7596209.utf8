The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, April 1: Two thousand bags of rice, which allegedly went missing from a godown that was sealed subsequently, have returned where they were.

 Enforcement branch officials were stunned to see the 50-kg bags again during a second inspection directed by a co-urt at the godown in Bankura town. Officials are in a quandary on how to proceed with the probe into pilfering of rice meant for ration shops. The godown had been leased by the co-operative department. 

 Barasat: BSF jawans detained four infiltrators from Bangladesh on Sunday and found documents with them suggesting they had links with some terrorist outfit. Senior BSF officers remained tight-lipped, but sources said that jawans patrolling the Haridaspur border in North 24-Parganas spotted the four around 1 pm.

 Calcutta: Swami Gokulananda, secretary of the Ramnakrishna Missions New Delhi centre, died on Saturday after suffering a cerebral stroke. He was 78. Swami Gokulananda had been serving as the secretary of the Delhi centre for the past 21 years. Sonia Gandhi, L.K. Advani and Pranab Mukherjee were among those to pay their last respects.

 Midnapore: Five persons were arrested from Belpahari on Sunday in connection with the killing of two CPM leaders two days ago. Police said they were among the 10 named in the FIR.

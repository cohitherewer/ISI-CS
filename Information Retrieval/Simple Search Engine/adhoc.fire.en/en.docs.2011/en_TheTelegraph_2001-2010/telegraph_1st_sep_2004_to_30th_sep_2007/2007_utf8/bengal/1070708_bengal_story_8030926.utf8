 Gastro scare in Calcutta

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, July 7: Water has started receding in Calcutta, but the fear of enteric diseases looms over areas such as Behala and Siriti in the south and Nagerbazar and Ultadanga in the north. 

 Civic officials refused to admit enteric disorders, but residents of Unique Park, Na-far Das Road and Hindustan Park in Behala, parts of which are still waterlogged, said at least 20-odd families were suffering from loose motion, nausea and headache. 

 The government later rushed a medical team to Behala. We are yet to receive a report, but it would be advisable to maintain a sense of hygiene, boil drinking water and stay away from food from outside, said Deb Dwaipaiyan Chattopadhyay, the city civic bodys chief medical officer.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya visited Siriti, Muchipara, Sakherbazar and Barisha this afternoon. 

 The chief minister expressed concern over waterlogging in parts of Dum Dum and Barrackpore. Large parts of Sodepur, Agarpara and Belghoria, too, are under water in North 24-Parganas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Intel keen on training tie-up

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 7: Global chip-major Intel Corporation has expressed interest in joining hands with the state government to start training in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design methodology in the state engineering colleges.

 VLSI is the process of creating integrated circuits by combining thousands of transistor-based circuits into a single chip.

 Training in VLSI design methodology will enable students to be employed in semiconductor companies.

 We received a mail from Intel saying they were interested in providing training on VLSI design methodologies in our engineering universities, said Siddharth, secretary, information technology, speaking at the IT Talkshoppe, an interactive session organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Saturday. The government will be taking the process further in a weeks time.

 Similar training in VLSI is also being provided in the state by institutes like the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, and Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur.

 Singur, June 3: Mamata Banerjee will march with begging bowls and Bengal farmers around Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai.

 Farmers from Singur and Nandigram and their families will walk in the bhookha michhils. Theyll help us expose the CPMs desperation to grab land across the country, the Trinamul Congress chief told a rally today.

 The road show with the hungry (bhookha) will travel to Jamshedpur and communist-ruled Kerala and Tripura.

 Todays rally at Bajemelia Hospital Ground, about 55 km from Calcutta was to mark a year of the agitation against the Tata Motors plant in Singur. Villagers had demonstrated when Tata Motors officials first came here on a recce on May 25, 2006.

 Work on the project is in full swing now and the Tatas hope to roll out the first Rs 1-lakh car by next year.

 Roads across the state would be blocked for an hour from 5 pm on Saturday to de-mand the return of land forcibly acquired for the Tata project and restoration of peace in Nandigram, Mamata said, with several Naxalite leaders by her side.

 The government has announced that no land will be acquired in Nandigram. 

 A Trinamul leader said over 2,000 people would be taken to Delhi and the other metros for Mamatas march. Well reserve trains for them. Everything will be finalised at a Save Farmland Committee meeting on Friday. The selection of those to go will begin soon.

 Calcutta/Durgapur, Aug. 16: Five teenagers and an 11-year-old drowned in different parts of the state yesterday.

 Kasba resident Sudip Nag, 16, was returning to a hotel in Bakkhali with his friends after a bath in the Hooghly last evening when he decided to go back to the river to wipe the mud off his feet. Sometime later, villagers informed his friends that Sudip had drowned.

 Shilpa Mal, 11, a resident of Bishnupur in South 24-Parganas, was bathing in a pond when she found herself struggling. She shouted for help and her 14-year-old friend, Shukla Bhowmick, jumped in. But she hugged Shilpa so tight that both got drowned, police said.

 Two girls and a boy fell into the turbulent Damodar and died. Debaditya Roychowdhury, 16, Sonai Das, 17, and Suvro Roy, 17, had gone on a picnic.

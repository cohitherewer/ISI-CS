The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Man in net for I-Day threat mails

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 16: A 31-year-old private firm employee who sent police into a tizzy by sending emails threatening terrorist strikes in the city on Independence Day was arrested from Shyampukur in north Calcutta this afternoon. 

 According to the deputy commissioner of police (special branch), Vineet Goyal, Raja Ram Saroj had identified Writers Buildings, the Tarakeshwar temple, Lalbazar police headquarters and Howrah Bridge as targets.

 He had sent the mails to the websites of Calcutta police and security agencies on August 13.

 He had also sent a mail to the PMO (Prime Ministers Office) claiming knowledge of a plot to kill the Prime Minister on August 15, Goyal said.

 Saroj is from Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh and has been staying in Calcutta for five years. 

 He is a graduate and works in a private company. He has a diploma in marketing management, Goyal said.

 We are trying to find out if it was a hoax mail or whether he has any links with terrorists, he added.

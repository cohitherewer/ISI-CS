The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Port Blair ship leaves, passengers on land

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 7: Nearly 200 people travelling to Port Blair reached the harbour on schedule this afternoon and realised that their ship had left without them because high tide came a few hours earlier than usual.

 The Shipping Corporation of India claimed that an advertisement was published in some newspapers, saying the time to embark MV Har- shavardana had been set between 10am and noon, instead of the usual 3.50pm-5.30pm.

 But some of the passengers had obviously not spotted the ad. They turned up at South Port Police Station and asked for their money back. 

 The demonstration continued for hours until the corporation promised in the night refunds and priority when bookings open for the next trip on August 14. 

 The passengers claimed they were not informed about the change in timing, while the shipping corporation officials said they had released ads in a few newspapers. There was a problem of communication. The passengers relented after they were assured of compensation, said deputy commissioner of police (port) Anand Kumar.

 The ship, which can carry 1,300 passengers, was anchored at Kidderpore dock early this morning. According to officials, over 600 passengers boarded the ship by noon. 

 The ship waited for an hour beyond the (new) scheduled time and left after 2pm, said a senior official. 

 But some of the passengers turned up after 3pm. That was due to no fault of ours. The ship had travelled some distance by then and it wasnt possible for it to return, he added.

 The number of latecomers swelled every passing minute and some of them threw stones at the shed in the dock.

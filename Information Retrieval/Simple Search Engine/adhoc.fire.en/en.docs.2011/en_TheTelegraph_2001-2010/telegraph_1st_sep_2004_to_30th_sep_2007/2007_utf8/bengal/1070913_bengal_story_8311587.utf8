The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Blackout forecast today

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 12: South Bengal reeled under power cuts triggered by scarcity of coal or its poor quality this evening. 

 The combined shortfall in areas served by the CESC and the State Electricity Distribution Company rose to 772MW in the peak hour.

 The Power Development Corporation said two units of the Santaldih power plant had to be shut down because of lack of coal and generation at Kolaghat dwindled because of the quality of coal. 

 We are helpless, said power development corporation MD S. Mahapatra.

 We dont expect much improvement tomorrow, an official of the electricity distribution company said.

 The situation was compounded by a snag in the hydel plant in Purulia, which usually generates 225MW in the peak hour. Its output today was zero.

 The 500MW NTPC plant in Farakka had been shut down a few days ago for repairs.

 Large parts of the city were plunged into darkness as the demand shot up in the evening. Blackouts ranging from one to two hours were reported from Lake Town, Kankurgachhi, Manicktala, Amherst Street, CR Avenue, Park Circus, Rashbehari, Regent Park, Jadavpur, Tollygunge and Garia.

 Power cuts ranged from five to six hours on average in the districts.

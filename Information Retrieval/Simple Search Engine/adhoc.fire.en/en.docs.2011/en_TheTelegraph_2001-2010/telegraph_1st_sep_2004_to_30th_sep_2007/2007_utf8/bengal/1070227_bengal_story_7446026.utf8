The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Rs 40 lakh gone in 20 minutes

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Suri, Feb. 26: They trickled into the bank like other customers, enquired about home loan and fixed deposit rates, availability of lockers and procedures to open accounts and then whipped out revolvers.

 Twenty minutes later, a gang of 10 walked out with Rs 40 lakh from the Rampurhat branch of the nationalised bank, about 270 km from Calcutta.

 Around 2.20 pm, one of the Hindi-speaking men pressed the nozzle of his six-chamber revolver against cashier Giyas Kutubuddins temple. Within seconds, the rest emerged from the other counters. 

 One of the goons demanded the keys to the vault from the cashier and the others fanned out. One went to branch manager Alok Choudhuris room and before he could press the alarm, he could feel the cold metal against his head.

 When I refused to hand over the keys, they abused me and threatened to kill me. The dacoits had taken control of the branch.... I was forced to open the vault and the cash box and they took all the money we had, said Choudhuri. There was about Rs 35.46 lakh.

 Once the vault was emptied, the robbers looted money and mobile phones from the real customers and bank employees. They took away the Rs 30,000 that I had just withdrawn and my phone, said Buddhadeb Dutta, 35, a trader. 

 The cash stuffed in five travel bags, the gun-toting gang ran up to a Maruti van. 

 The bank did not have a security guard. 

 We have alerted all police stations in Birbhum and neighbouring districts. Raids have begun, subdivisional police officer Mrinal Majumdar said.

 Rampurhat being a hub of grocery wholesalers, the branch did brisk business, said an officer.

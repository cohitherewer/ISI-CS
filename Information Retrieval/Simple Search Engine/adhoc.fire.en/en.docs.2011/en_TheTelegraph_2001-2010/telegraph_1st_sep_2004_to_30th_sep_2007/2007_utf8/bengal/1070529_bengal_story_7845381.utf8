The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Scrap loot slur on land warriors

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta/Midnapore, May 28: A huge quantity of scrap iron and old machinery allegedly stolen from a closed ship-repairing yard in Nandigram was recovered in Kakdwip this morning. 

 The consignment was loaded on a fishing trawler that was intercepted in the South 24-Parganas town.

 Two men travelling on the trawler, Ma Haraparbati, were handed over to police. Both are from Nandigram. 

 Interrogation of the duo led to the arrest of three more from Kakdwip and Manicktala in Calcutta who are believed to be the buyers.

 The CPMs Jadavpur MP, Sujan Chakraborty, who visited the spot and the Kakdwip police station, claimed the Nandigram duo were members of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee. 

 He alleged that they were selling stolen goods to raise funds for firearms to be used against CPM supporters. 

 The two told me the stolen goods were loaded on the trawler by one Nishikanta Mondal and his associates, the MP said. Nishikanta is a prominent committee member. 

 Work at the Burn Standard yard, set up in 1977, stopped after about four years. Since then, it has been idle. 

 Theft of old machines and scrap from the workshop, manned by two guards appointed by the company, has apparently increased since Nandigram erupted in January. 

 The police cannot enter Nandigram. This has made it easy for Pratirodh Committee activists to plunder the yard, said Chakraborty.

 Pratirodh Committee convener and Trinamul Congress leader Abu Taher denied the MPs allegations. 

 Theft from the closed workshop isnt new. Who was stealing from the yard earlier? asked Taher, who was part of Mamata Banerjees team that went to discuss peace at the all-party meeting.

 Haldia (East Midnapore), May 30: A girl who watched her father being beaten up and burnt alive in the January 6 Nandigram violence has passed Madhyamik, held a month later.

 Today, Madhusree Samanta, who appeared for the exam from Sonachura, couldnt hold back her tears. 

 At first I had decided I wouldnt take the test, sobbed the 17-year-old, who is now living in a CPM camp with 12 family members. 

 Her father Sankar Samanta was dragged out of his house, thrashed and set ablaze, allegedly by Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee activists. 

 Sankar was a CPM-backed Independent member of the Sonachura village panchayat. 

 She (Madhusree) was so traumatised that she had decided not to sit for her examination. We persuaded her to take the test. Her result is unbelievably good considering the trying times she has been through, said Swapan Das, the headmaster of Kasari High School. 

 Madhusree, who has scored 380, said her father always stressed the importance of education.

 He would tell me to study well. He thought education helped women fight oppression in society. His words inspired me to fulfil his dream. My teachers and family members also helped me with invaluable support, said Madhusree, tears rolling down. 

 Part of a family that once owned a lot of land, the Samantas have now taken shelter in a 12 by 15 ft room provided by the CPM near Haldia. The threat to the family has not blown way. 

 Madhusrees brother Partha is a sociology (honours) student at Khejuri College. 

 The family is struggling to get over the murder of Sankar, who was elected to the panchayat in 2003. 

 After the CPMs loss in Panskura, the 2008 rural polls were almost on every lip in Nandigram today.

 If I get an opportunity to talk to Mamata Banerjee, Ill ask her what right she has to support a political battle that leaves girls like us orphans and living in fear, Madhusree said. 

 She wants to take science, but isnt sure if her marks will be enough. I want to study science at the higher secondary level. But with my marks, it may not be possible. Anyway, Ive taken this as a challenge and will try to make the best out of the situation, said Madhusree said, brimming with confidence.

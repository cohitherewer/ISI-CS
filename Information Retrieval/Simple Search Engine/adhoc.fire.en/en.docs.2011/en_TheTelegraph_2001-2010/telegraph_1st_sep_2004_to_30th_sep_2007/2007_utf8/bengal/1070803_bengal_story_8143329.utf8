The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Allies join compensation cry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 2: The CPMs allies today joined the Opposition in demanding compensation for the victims of the Nandigram police firing, putting Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee under pressure to go the Andhra Pradesh way.

 It is under consideration, but no decision has been taken as yet, state home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy said at Writers Buildings. 

 The Congress government in Andhra has declared a relief package for those who fell to police bullets on Saturday during a Left-led bandh to demand distribution of vacant government land among the poor.

 Bhattacharjee is yet to voice his opinion on compensation for the Nandigram victims and is expected to discuss the issue with the allies tomorrow, CPM sources said. 

 A section of the party leadership, keen to ensure a meeting between the chief minister and Trinamul Congress president Mamata Banerjee, feels payment of compensation might help break the ice.

 But some CPM leaders fear it might put Mamata on a moral high ground. 

 CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar had yesterday ruled out compensation for the Nandigram deaths, saying it would amount to paying a riotous mob who want to establish a jungle raj and declare war against the state.

 The government might consider paying damages on compassionate grounds only if they (Trinamul leaders) admit their follies, he had said.

 Denying any parallel between Nandigram and the Andhra firing that Trinamul has been trying to draw Konar said his party was not at all ashamed of the police action in Nandigram.

 The CPM allies today went hammer and tongs at Konar. 

 Describing the Nandigram land war as a democratic movement, Forward Bloc veteran Asoke Ghosh held the government responsible for the violence there. 

 He also asked CPM state secretary and Left Front chairman Biman Bose to convene a Front meeting to clear the confusion in the public mind created by Konars statement. 

 Ghosh pulled up the CPM leader for lacking restraint. 

 I may be wrong, but I think Jyoti Basu, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Biman Bose do not agree with Konars description of the Nandigram movement, he said. 

 RSP leader Kshiti Goswami echoed him. 

 Defending the demand for compensation, he said: It was the decision of the Left Front. The draft resolution prepared by the Left Front for the all-party meeting on May 24 condemned the police firing, asked for punishment for those responsible for it and demanded compensation for the families of the victims. 

 Goswami also demanded a formal discussion in the state cabinet on the compensation.

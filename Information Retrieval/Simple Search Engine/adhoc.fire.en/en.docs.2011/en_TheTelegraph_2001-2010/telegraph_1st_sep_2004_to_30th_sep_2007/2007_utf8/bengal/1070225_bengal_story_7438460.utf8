The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Blunders again in Madhyamik papers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 24: A day after an incomplete question paper had Madhyamik examinees scratching their heads in confusion, several blunders were spotted in the life science paper today.

 There were gross differences between the Bengali and English versions of the question paper, students said.

 For instance, in the Bengali version of question No. 2, students were asked the deficiency of which vitamin causes night blindness. Its English version was: Due to deficiency of which hormone does night blindness occur? 

 Night blindness is caused by a deficiency of vitamin A, which means the English question was wrong.

 In another question, again in the English version of the paper, the pulmonary vein was referred to as pulmonary artery. The Bengali question was correct.

 But the Bengali version was not entirely clean.

 In a glaring example of carelessness, the second part of a question gave the answer to the first. The question was: Which kind of microbe is yeast? The answer is fungus.

 But the students didnt have to trouble their grey cells to figure that out as the second part of the question was: Why is it called a beneficial fungus? 

 This time, the English paper setters did not make a mistake and dropped the word fungus from the second part.

 Ujwal Basu, the president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, admitted lack of care on the part of the paper setters and moderators. We will ensure that students do not suffer, he added. 

 Teachers,too, came down heavily on the authorities.

 This is the first board exam for students. These mistakes may appear to be very small. But they lead to immense confusion. We will take up the matter with higher authorities in the government, said Ratan Laskar, a member of the Secondary Teachers and Employees Association.

 Rapist let off with a fine

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Jan. 10: The elders of a Murshidabad village let off a rapist with a fine of Rs 2,000.

 The victim, a 35-year-old widow, was turned away by police when she went to lodge a complaint yesterday.

 Farida Bewa (name changed) of Masterpara village in Raninagar, about 240 km from Calcutta, had stepped out of home for a daily chore early on January 2 when Nizam Sheikh, 30, dragged her to a mustard field and raped her.

 Two other men who were going to their fields for work saw Nizam, a farmer with two children, fleeing from the scene of the crime.

 When I wanted to go to the police, the village elders asked me not to. They organised a shalishi, fined Nizam Sheikh Rs 2,000 and let him go. Those who conducted the shalishi called me a woman of loose morals, said Farida, whose husband Azizul Sheikh died eight years ago. 

 She has two school-going children a son and a daughter. She runs the family binding bidis and earning Rs 30 a day.

 The officer in charge of Raninagar, Samit Bhattacharya, admitted that the woman had gone to the police station. She only told us she was feeling insecure in her village and urged us to ensure she could live safely, he claimed.

 Bhattacharya was apparently not at the station when the woman went there. He couldnt say what his force had done to make her feel secure.

 Farida said she was virtually shooed away from there by an officer who asked her to obey the villagers verdict.

 Two panchayat members the CPMs Kalam Sheikh and the Congresss Amjad Sheikh were the chief judges at the shalishi on Friday.

 On Monday, some villagers who were part of the jury came to Farida to hand over the money. 

 I felt insulted and sick and at the sight of them. I refused the money and went to the police yesterday to lodge a complaint, she said.

 Kalam Sheikh maintained that there was nothing wrong in their order. What would she have gained by sending the rapist to jail? he asked.

 Additional superintendent of police Shankar Chakraborty has ordered an inquiry into the incident. I have asked the Domkol subdivisional police officer to submit a report. If the police at Raninagar have behaved badly with the widow, action will be taken against the personnel there, he said.

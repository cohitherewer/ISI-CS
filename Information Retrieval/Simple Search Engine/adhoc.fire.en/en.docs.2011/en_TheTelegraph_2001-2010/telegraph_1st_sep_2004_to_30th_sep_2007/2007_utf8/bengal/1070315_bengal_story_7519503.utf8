Calcutta, March 14: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today arrived in the Assembly to make a statement on the Nandigram violence but had to leave after being informed that the House had been adjourned for the day.

 Neither Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim nor the government chief whip, Syed Mahammed Masih, informed Bhattacharjee, the leader of the House, about the adjournment.

 The Trinamul Congress and the Congress had demanded a statement from the chief minister earlier in the day, prompting him to arrive in the Assembly at 3.55 pm.

 Refusing to speak on Nandigram after reaching the Assembly, Bhattacharjee said: I have no choice as the statement will have to be made on the floor of the House.

 Saying this, the chief minister walked towards the House, with some CPM MLAs and opened the door, only to find it empty.

 Taken by surprise, Bhattacharjee turned to CPM MLA Rabin Mondal, who told him that the House had adjourned five minutes before his arrival.

 The chief minister walked into the Speakers chamber, stayed there for about five minutes and then left. I will make a statement in the House tomorrow, Bhattacharjee said.

 Asked whether there was any communication gap, the Speaker said: The chief minister did not know that the House had been adjourned. He was also not aware of the Opposition walkout because of which the House was adjourned two hours before schedule. He came to issue a statement on Nandigram as he didnt have the right information (about the adjournment). Tomorrow, he will issue the statement on the floor of the House.

 We are least bothered about the chief ministers statement. We shall stay away from the House till Friday, said Partha Chatterjee, leader of the Opposition in the Assembly.

 Congress general secretary Manas Bhunia said party president Sonia Gandhi had been informed about the Nandigram incident and added that the condition in Bengal calls for imposition of Presidents rule.

 PCC working president Pradip Bhattacharyya briefed Sonia about the barbaric incident. A report is being prepared to be sent to external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee.

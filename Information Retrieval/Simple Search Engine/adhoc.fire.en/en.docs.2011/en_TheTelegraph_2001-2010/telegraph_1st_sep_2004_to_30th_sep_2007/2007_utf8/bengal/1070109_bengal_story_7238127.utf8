 Sense of urgency on rehab plan

 Singh: Win-win formula

 New Delhi, Jan. 8: The Centre is speeding up a more humane rehabilitation policy for those who lose their land to special economic zones and other industrial projects.

 The Prime Minister today told a business conclave his government was putting the finishing touches to the package, which officials said would seek to offer alternative plots or means of livelihood along with cash compensation.

 We will be finalising a new rehabilitation policy in three months and this will be more progressive, humane and conducive to the long-term welfare of all stakeholders, Manmohan Singh said. It must be a win-win process for all....

 Sources said the policy might include a national-level rehabilitation council that will vet packages being offered to landlosers. If states pass acts that dovetail into the central law, there will also be state-level rehabilitation councils.

 Officials said the issue had become urgent following the unrest in Nandigram and Singur a year after the bloodshed at Orissas Kalinganagar, where nine tribals died in police firing as they protested land takeover for a steel project.

 With the land wars becoming a national issue and getting enmeshed in a rising Maoist movement in tribal areas, officials said, the Centre needs to quickly coordinate with the states to work out a solution.

 There is no reason why the spread of industrialisation should be a contentious issue in our country, Singh told the industrialists.

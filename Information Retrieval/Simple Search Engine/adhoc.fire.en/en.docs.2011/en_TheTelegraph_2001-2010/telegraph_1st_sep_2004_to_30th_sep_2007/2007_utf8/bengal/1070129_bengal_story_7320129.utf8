The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Worry over twin councils

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, Jan. 28: An anno- uncement by the state government and a move being planned by the UGC that every college must get accreditation from both the Bengal and national councils have put principals in a fix.

 There would be chaos, some of them feel, in case of a disparity in their assessments. 

 We welcome the states decision to set up a separate council, but there must be coordination between NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council) and the state body. Otherwise, the exercise will lead to a chaos, said the general secretary of the West Bengal Council of College Principals, Kalachand Saha.

 For instance, he added, if a college is rated highly by NAAC but poorly by the other, the result will be confusion. 

 Higher education minister Sudarshan Roychowdhury had announced in the Assembly the governments plan to set up a state-level accreditation council for the 400-odd state-aided colleges.

 UGC chairman Sukhdeo Thorat welcomed the move. A similar body is already there in Maharashtra, he said. 

 The national council, introduced in the late 1990s, is planning to make it compulsory for all universities and colleges to get accreditation from it. 

 It is up to the colleges to seek accreditation now, but unless they do it, the 6,000-odd colleges and 350-odd universities in the country cannot claim central and UGC funds.

 Seventy per cent of the colleges in the state lack the accreditation.

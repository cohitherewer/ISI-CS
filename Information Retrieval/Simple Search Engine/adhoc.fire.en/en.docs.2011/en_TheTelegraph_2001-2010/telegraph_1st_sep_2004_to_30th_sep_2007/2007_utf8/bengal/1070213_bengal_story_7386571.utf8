The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Reverse-train ruckus

 Krishnagar, Feb. 12: A group of daily passengers zeal to reach their workplace on time would make Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee proud.

 After being stuck at Nadias Birnagar station for over an hour this morning because of a rail blockade somewhere else, they asked the station manager to order a Krishnagar-bound train to take them to Sealdah. 

 When Amit Biswas said it was not possible, he was dragged out of his office and the room was locked up.

 About 1,000 people stopped trains on the Krishnagar-Sealdah line from seven this morning demanding a level crossing at Badkulla, 78 km from Calcutta. 

 Some 100 Birnagar residents refused to suffer because of them. They wanted the Krishnagar-bound train, which was also stuck, to head in the opposite direction.

 A large police team reopened Biswass office but normality returned only around 11, after the blockade was lifted. 

 We were angry because the station authorities did not alert us about the demonstration at Badkulla over the public address system. Had they done so, we could have taken a bus, said Chinmoy Bhaduri, who works in a private firm.

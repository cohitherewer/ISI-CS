 Kalimpong/Calcutta, May 15: Two persons were killed and three went missing when a jeep heading to Gangtok from Siliguri plunged into the Teesta today.

 There were 11 in the Mahindra Maxx, including a couple from Calcutta who had planned to celebrate their wedding anniversary in the hills. 

 Mehul Desai, 32, is missing. Mridula, 26, is in hospital.

 Desai, an employee of the Salt Lake branch of ICICI Bank, lives in Garia.

 They had come to the city from Ahmedabad some six months ago. 

 Doctors at Anandalok Nursing Home in Siliguri, where Mridula was admitted, said her injury in the leg was not very serious.

 The condition of Suman Saha, a resident of JL Nehru Road in Durgapur, was serious. He was hurt in the head. 

 Suman, 23, was going to appear in an interview for a pharmaceutical company job. 

 He has been admitted to the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital with Mamata Magar and Jiban Modak, a carpenter from Siliguri. 

 Mamata, 29, and Modak, 27, also suffered head injuries.

 Another couple, Bhavesh and Kheti Narsana, are also being treated at Anandalok.

 The jeep swerved off the road and fell into the river 50 feet below apparently after a loose boulder from the hillside fell on the roof, just above the drivers seat. 

 The NH 31A is known to be landslide prone at Likhubir, around 45 km from Siliguri. 

 The dead were identified as Anil Subba, 32, the driver from Sikkim, and P. Varghavi Amma, 50, a retired schoolteacher living in Rumtek. 

 Kalimpong additional superintendent of police Humayun Kabir said Ammas son Ramesh Acharya is among those missing. The other missing person is yet to be identified. 

 Mamata was travelling with Amma.

 The Desais had rented an apartment on the first floor of a multi-storeyed building at 126 Barada Avenue. 

 Mridula called Moushumi Mukherjee, who lives in her building, around 1 pm, to tell her what had happened. 

 Moushumi and her husband Sudip are flying to Siliguri tomorrow. 

 Krishna Ghosh, a medicine dealer in Siliguri, said a customer called from Calcutta to say he was a relative of the Narsanas. He asked Ghosh to take care of them. 

 The police couldnt say where the Narsanas were from.

 Singur, Aug. 19: Police lobbed 150 teargas shells today to disperse a Save Farmland Committee mob trying to pull down a section of the wall around the Tata Motors plot.

 In heavy rain, about 300 people led by Trinamul Congress leader Becharam Manna assembled at New Ujjal Sanghas playground in Bajemelia, 100 metres from the wall, a little after noon. 

 The police took position when they started moving towards the project site, raising slogans against the Tatas. 

 The mob was armed with stones and the police batons proved ineffective against attackers standing at a distance. 

 The mob was very aggre-ssive. There would have been casualties had we not lobbed teargas shells in defence, Hooghly superintendent of police Rajib Mishra said.

 A shell injured activist Ramesh Koley and the news emboldened the attackers. Police were also pelted with stones at Beraberi Purbapara, Khasherbheri, Bosepukur and Gopalnagar. 

 The trouble lasted for nearly two hours.

 Mishra said 150 rounds of teargas shells were fired. Three policemen, including deputy superintendent Pradip Biswas, were injured. 

 Biswas needed 11 stitches in the mouth. Constables Narayan Majumdar and Nabin Kishore Roy got 12 stitches each.

 We could have been killed, Majumdar said from Chinsurah Sadar Hospital.

 In June, the committee had made a similarly futile attempt to pull down the wall. The police were attacked from the same areas then.

 Manna, however, accused the police of attacking farmers going to their land to sow aman paddy. He also warned of more bloodshed.

 The Tatas have promised the first Rs 1-lakh car by 2008.

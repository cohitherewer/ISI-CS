The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bloc chief at Mamata door for peace 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 28: Ashok Ghosh is ready to go to Mamata Banerjees house to discuss the second round of talks on Nandigram to reciprocate her trip to the Forward Bloc office before Round I.

 The Bloc state secretary has told the Trinamul Congress chief that he wants to call on her to discuss the agenda for the talks. 

 I told her that I shall meet her at the place she chooses. I dont mind visiting her Kalighat house, he said.

 A Left Front meeting will be held on Saturday to discuss the way ahead in the drive to ensure normality in Nandi- gram. The decision was taken this morning after Ghosh told Left Front chairman and state CPM secretary Biman Bose that substantial homework needs to be done on what sort of discussion should take place the next time.

 Earlier, too, the Bloc state secretary had offered to meet Mamata at her home, but she spared the veteran leader the trouble.

 Mamata went to the Bloc headquarters on Central Avenue on May 19 and took just 30 minutes to finalise the date for the all-party meeting. 

 She described her one-to-one with Ashokda as a turning point in Bengal politics. In return, Ghosh said: Mamata is not only Trinamuls leader, but our leader, too. 

 Asked about Ghoshs statement today, Mamata said: I welcome his peace initiative. I would like to see what the front decides at its June 2 meeting.

 The Trinamul chief has convened a meeting of party leaders in her Kalighat house tomorrow to discuss strategy in the light of the fresh front initiative for peace.

 Mamata had walked out of the all-party meeting at Mahajati Sadan on Thursday after front leaders refused to dub the police firing that led to 14 deaths on March 14 as genocide.

 There was ganahatya, which can be described as genocide, massacre or mass killings. The government will have to admit in plain and simple Bengali that the March 14 incident was ganahatya, she iterated today.

 The all-party meeting had begun with a CPI leader reading out the resolution. A resolution can be adopted only after holding discussions. Moreover, such a meeting becomes meaningless if the police firing and the subsequent murder of Nandigram people are not discussed, Mamata added. 

 There is merit in Mamatas argument, said Ghosh, adding that he would discuss the issue with the front chief.

 Im aware of Mamatas insistence on the inclusion of the word genocide in the resolution to be adopted at any future all-party meeting. Thats why, we want to discuss every aspect threadbare in the front before the second round, the Bloc leader added.

 Congress leader Manas Bhuniya today echoed Mamata, accusing the CPM of trying to dilute the issue of the police firing and calling it ganahatya, which literally means mass killing.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today met chief secretary A.K. Deb and health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, an MLA from West Midnapore, to review law and order in Nandigram. Deb said the situation was peaceful there.

 Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen later said: We havent yet decided where the chemical hub would come up, but it will have to be near the (Haldia) port.

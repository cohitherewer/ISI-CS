 Calcutta, April 28: The seasons severest Norwester hit the city and its neighbouring areas this afternoon.

 Wind blew at 56 km an hour and there was 21.6 mm of rain, the Met office said. 

 There could be more rain and a squall tomorrow. A warning has been issued for the south Bengal districts.

 Trees were uprooted in Salt Lake and on VIP road, resulting in traffic snarls. 

 But after a scorching week, the rain brought relief. The temperature in the city dropped by around 5 degrees Celsius over 24 hours. 

 Dark clouds started gathering over the city from 1 pm and a dusty wind started blowing about an hour later. A heavy shower accompanied by thunder and lightning followed. 

 The rain was accompanied by hail in the north for about 45 minutes.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation said there was waterlogging in Ultadanga. Tram services were disrupted at several places. 

 Heavy incursion of moisture from the Bay of Bengal resulted in the cloud cover over Calcutta this morning, said the weatherman. 

 A cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) formed over Gangetic Bengal and its adjoining areas today and it sucked in loads of moisture from the sea. Todays de- velopment of clouds and the subsequent thunderstorm is called an acute Norwester activity in meteorological parlance, he added.

 The official said a partly cloudy sky is expected tomorrow and there is a possibility of rain or thundershower in the afternoon or evening. The maximum temperature is likely to be around 35 degrees.

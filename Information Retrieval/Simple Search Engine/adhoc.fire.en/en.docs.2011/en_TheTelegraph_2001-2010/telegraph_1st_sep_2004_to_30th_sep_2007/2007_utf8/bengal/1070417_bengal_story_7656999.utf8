The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Talks fail to break HM deadlock

 - Union wants withdrawal 

of suspensions since 2005

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, April 16: The first meeting involving the Hindustan Motors management, its unions and the government to break the deadlock at the Uttarpara plant fell through this evening with none budging from their stands.

 The government said the deadlock continues because of the unions insistence that the suspension of all workers since 2005 should be withdrawn. 

 The suspended workers had been charged with various offences, including assaulting management employees. 

 We tried our best. But the talks fell through at the last moment as the unions refused to call off the strike and demanded the withdrawal of suspension of all workers since 2005, labour minister Mrinal Banerjee said after the four-hour meeting.

 A tripartite meeting could not take place last Friday because of the absence of management representatives. 

 Banerjee said he has asked the unions and the management to sort out the differences among themselves. 

 The management is, however, mulling a direct line of communication with the workers, bypassing the unions. 

 It has decided to write to over 4,500 employees, explaining its point of view. We are talking to them individually even now. We are trying to say that this strike would not help anyone, neither the company nor the management, a Hind Motors executive said.

 The unions called a strike in the factory about 20 km from Calcutta on March 13, demanding their December-January salary arrears, lifting of a six-year freeze on DA and withdrawal of the suspension of 15 workers.

 The company cleared the arrears and said that the DA decision was pending before a tribunal that the unions had approached. 

 The suspensions, it said, cannot be lifted because they were on disciplinary grounds.

 The management suspended work on April 11, a day after factory manager Debashish Mukhopadhyay was beaten up by the workers. His condition continues to be critical.

 It looks like the unions are not keen to solve the problem. They are coming up with new demands every now and then. But we have faith in our employees and they will choose the right path, the executive said.

 After the tripartite meeting failed, the minister held discussions separately with leaders from each union and two management representatives the Uttarpara plant executive vice-president, Moloy Choudhury, and adviser D. Munshi.

 We cannot consider the workers demands if they continue to assault us, Choudhury said.

 Amitava Bhattacharya, president of the Sangrami Shramik Karmachari Union, made it clear that it would not call off the strike until the suspensions were withdrawn. The management is being rigid. It should show a token gesture by withdrawing the suspension of some, he said.

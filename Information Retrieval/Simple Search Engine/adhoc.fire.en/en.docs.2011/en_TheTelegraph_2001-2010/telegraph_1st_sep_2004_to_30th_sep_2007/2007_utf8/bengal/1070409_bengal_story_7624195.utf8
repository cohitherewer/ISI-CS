 Govt orders probe into crash

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 8: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government today ordered a probe to ascertain if a security lapse had resulted in the accident.

 Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said additional director-general of police, intelligence branch, Dilip Mitra will conduct the inquiry. He would look into how the accident occurred.

 An officer who oversees VIP security said Mukherjee gets Z+ protection during his stay in the state. 

 That means his convoy comprised a pilot car and two others carrying four armed personnel each in front and a jeep carrying three policemen in the rear. 

 Manas Bhuniya, the Congress leader accompanying Mukherjee last night, today alleged that the pilot car had sped far ahead, leaving behind the ministers car.

 A convoy of trucks was coming from the opposite direction when we were passing through Bethuadahari. When one of them hit us, the pilot car was nowhere near.

 Mamata Banerjee said: There must have been some negligence on the part of those overseeing Pranabdas security.

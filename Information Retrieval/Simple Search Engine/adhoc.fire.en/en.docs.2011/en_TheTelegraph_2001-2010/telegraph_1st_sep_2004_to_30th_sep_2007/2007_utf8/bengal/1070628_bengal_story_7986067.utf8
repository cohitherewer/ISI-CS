The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Flames doused, 

fear rages

 - Maoists in trousers and shirts stun employees, villagers peep from home and quiver

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Purulia, June 27: Six hours had passed since a gang of Maoists left Biramdih railway station after setting it on fire, but Basudeb Mahato was still trembling like a leaf.

 After todays incident, we feel very insecure. This is a Maoist belt but we have not heard about Maoists attacking a railway station in Bengal before. So, we did not bother earlier. But now we are feeling scared, said Basudeb, whose job as a gang man involves maintaining tracks.

 Basudeb was sitting in the stationmasters room along with another gang man, Buddheswar Mahato, when the rebels stormed in. 

 It was about 1.30 at night and we were thinking of asking Pravas Mahato (a group-D employee) for some tea when the revolver-toting men marched into the room. We had heard that Maoists dress in olive green. But these people were wearing shirts and trousers. We panicked and did not know what to do, Buddheswar said.

 The villagers of Biramdih who live near the station are in a similar state of panic.

 Most of us were sleeping when we heard people shouting from the direction of the station. We heard the slogans and knew they were Maoists. We were too scared to come out and only peeped through doors and windows. Suddenly we saw flames leaping out of the windows of the stationmasters office and we realised that the Maoists had set the station on fire, said Subhas Mahato.

 No villager dared to come out of his house till the rebels had left.

 Senior railway officials who visited the spot today said security was being beefed up in trains and stations. 

 We have taken steps to increase surveillance by the Railway Protection Force in all passenger trains passing through the section. We have also decided to increase vigil on tracks and at stations, said Kalishankar Mukherjee, the senior divisional commercial manager in Adra.

 Mukherjee met both Basudeb and Buddheswar and assured them that security would be tightened. 

 He requested them to return to their railway quarters near the station, take a bath and eat something. 

 We are always trying to boost the morale of our employees working in remote areas. I told them (Basudeb and Buddheswar) to go and rest in their quarters. After, all they will have to return to work. I think they have taken the entire matter professionally, Mukherjee said.

 He added that employees of the railways engineering department would continue to inspect the tracks between Barabhum in Purulia and Chandil in Jharkhand at night. We know that these men from the engineering division are unarmed. But they will continue to be on their rounds, Mukherjee said.

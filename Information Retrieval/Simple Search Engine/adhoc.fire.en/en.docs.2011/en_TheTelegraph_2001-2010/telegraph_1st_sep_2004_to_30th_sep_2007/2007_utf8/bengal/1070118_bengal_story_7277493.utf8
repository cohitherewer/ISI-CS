The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Murder in Nandigram

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Nandigram, Jan. 17: The land war zone simmered with tension today after a Trinamul Congress activist was found dead in a pool of blood early this morning.

 Arup Das, 48, owned a trekker and carried passengers from Nandigram to Chandipur. He was last seen engaged in an argument with three persons at a tiles factory at Kandopasara, about 150 km from Calcutta, last night. 

 Both Garanberia, where Arup lived, and neighbouring Kandopasara, where his body was found, are outside the proposed land acquisition map that had triggered violence here last week. But Trinamul leaders claimed that he was an active member of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee.

 As the news spread, Trinamul called a 12-hour Nandigram bandh today. A mob also refused to hand over the body to police for hours.

 Block Trinamul president and the convener of the committee, Abu Taher, alleged that the CPM had engineered the murder to disrupt the initiative to restore peace in Nandigram. The CPM realises that it is fast losing its grip on the villagers. So its cadres are trying to foment trouble.

 The East Midnapore CPM leadership blamed Trinamul infighting for the death. 

 Additional superintendent of police (headquarters) Shyamal Bhattacharya said a worker of the tiles factory has been detained for interrogation. Arup was hit on the head with blunt weapons, he added. 

 The administration is yet to initiate full-scale repair of roads dug up on the night of January 3 because villagers are not cooperating.

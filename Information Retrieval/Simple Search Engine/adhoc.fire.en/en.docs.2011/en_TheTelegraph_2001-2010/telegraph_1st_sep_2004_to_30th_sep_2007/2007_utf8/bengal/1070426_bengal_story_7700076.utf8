The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Minister welcomes Reliance retail

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Calcutta, April 25: Urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya today welcomed Calcutta Municipal Corporations move to develop the Park Circus market jointly with Reliance. 

 But Naren Chatterjee, chairman of the Forward Bloc-controlled agriculture marketing board, offered support to develop crumbling markets to prevent Reliance from making a backdoor entry into retail. 

 Chatterjee will send his proposal to mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya tomorrow.

 The Bloc and the CPMs other Left Front partners the RSP and the CPI are opposing the Reliance bid to start farm products retailing. They want the front to discuss the issue in its May 7 meeting.

 But Asok Bhattacharya made the governments stand clear. Whats wrong in Reliance bidding highest and get- ting the CMC job? Parkomat has come up through joint venture. City Centre in Salt Lake is another example. Many municipalities have welcomed private partnership for development. There are similar plans to revamp the seven-eight markets run by the Calcutta Improvement Trust. 

 There are differences over Reliances entry into the farm products business but it cannot be prevented from setting up malls and supermarkets while the front decides on the farm business, he said. 

 Indian companies cant be treated like FDI (foreign direct investment).

 He rejected the marketing boards proposal to hand over to it all haats (weekly village bazaars) and markets run by the civic and rural bodies. This is absurd and illegal. Municipalities and panchayats run markets lawfully. The boards jurisdiction ends with wholesale farm products markets, Bhattacharya said.

 The allies insisted that minister Asok Bhattacharyas voice was not the CPMs.

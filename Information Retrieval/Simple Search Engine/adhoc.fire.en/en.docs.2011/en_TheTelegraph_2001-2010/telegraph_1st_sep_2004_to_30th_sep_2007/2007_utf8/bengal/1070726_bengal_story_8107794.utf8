 Rosogollas fly off racks in Nandigram

 Nandigram, July 25: The result in Haldia might be a drubbing for the Opposition, but Nandigram didnt think so.

 Cheers greeted the news of the final tally here. The green gulal flew in the air and sweetmeats off shelves.

 For the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee, Trinamul Congresss six seats were good enough.

 The festivities started around noon. Flocks of green-heads crowded sweet shops and huge stocks as if ready in anticipation of a feast of rosogolla, gaja and danadar vanished.

 The Pratirodh Committee took out processions in Maheshpur, Sonachura, Gokulnagar and Nandigram bazaar. Each had nearly 1,000 people.

 We are very happy. There are cracks in the Left bastion. The people of Haldia have taught the CPM a lesson for trying to grab farmland and set up SEZs, said Abu Taher, the convener of the committee.

 Leading the procession in Sonachura was Santosh Jana, 52. On March 14, Santosh had narrowly escaped a police bullet. The people have rejected the governments attempt to take over farmland, he said.

 Those like Taher and Santosh were in no mood to lis- ten when reminded that the result for the Opposition was no better than the one in 1997.

 Who cares about 1997. We know 2002 and the CPM had all the seats then. Winning six wards is an achievement, said Sheikh Sufian, a Pratirodh Committee convener and Trinamul leader.

 In Haldia, Trinamul celebrations were muted. 

 A leader conceded that the party had expected to wrest the board. Our mahajot (grand alliance) didnt work 100 per cent. The Congress did not win a single seat and we feel bad about it, said Ananda Adhikary.

 After Panskura, we expected to win all the seats. Now that the CPM-led front has won, they might be attacked, he added.

 The CPM leadership has asked cadres to exercise restraint. We have asked them to only take out small processions in their wards. Well bring party secretary Biman Bose to Haldia and celebrate the victory through a mahamichhil (grand procession), said MP Lakshman Seth. 

 Industries minister Nirupam Sen said in the Assembly lobby that the CPM workers who have been rendered homeless by the land war will now get an impetus to return home.

 Bose, however, did not link the poll results with the return of party workers, who were forced to flee homes in Nandigram.

 Cheques for land in Haldia

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Haldia, Aug. 4: Distribution of compensation cheques for land acquired by the government in Haldia over a year ago six months before trouble erupted in Nandigram will resume next week.

 It had been stalled first because of the violence in Nandigram and then as the CPM waited for the outcome of the Haldia municipal polls. 

 East Midnapore district magistrate Anup Agarwal ruled out any fresh acquisition. Land in the Chakdwipa and Raghunathchawk areas of Haldia about 450 acres had been acquired over a year ago. These are not fresh but old acquisitions. Even the payment of compensation has been completed in Raghunathchawk. It is only for the land in Chakdwipa that cheques would be given out on August 6, 7 and 8.

 Agarwal clarified that the land had been acquired to create a land bank for small industrial projects and not a mega chemical hub.

 The announcement of the resumption of cheque distribution was made on July 26, a day after the CPM emerged victorious in the Haldia polls. 

 Barun Mondal, 24, a CPM supporter injured in last Sundays firing in Nandigram, succumbed to his injuries today.

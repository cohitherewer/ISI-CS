The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Decade on, but no bench

 AVIJIT SINHA

 Siliguri, March 2: The government had announced its decision to set up a high court circuit bench in Jalpaiguri a decade ago.

 We were all elated, but then things started to slow down despite many reconnaissance missions by various judges from Calcutta, said Gautam Pal, secretary of the Circuit Bench Sarbik Unnayan Dabi Aday Samannoy Committee, which is pressing for the circuit bench.

 Five years after the states announcement, the Union government declared in 2002 that the bench would indeed be set up in Jalpaiguri. Two years later, 40 acres were acquired for it.

 After that, high court judges made several trips to Jalpaiguri and discussed infrastructure with the administration, the bar association as well as the committee.

 It was decided that the circuit bench would be temporarily housed in the zilla parishad bungalow. The bungalow was renovated and handed over to the law department. Then the judges wanted to know where they would be accommodated, Pal said.

 An annexe to the circuit house with four suites was built. Two suites at an irrigation department bungalow were also reserved for the judges. But even after the district administration handed over these buildings to the law department in January last year, nothing was moving. Then in July, the full bench of the high court cited legal loopholes, Pal added.

 Jalpaiguri, like the rest of north Bengal, had been demanding the bench since 1963. 

 Travelling all the way to Calcutta for a hearing, coming back and going again is a drain on time and money for thousands.

 The court did not consider the human face of the movement and concentrated only on the technical part, Manik Sanyal, the Jalpaiguri CPM secretary, said today.

 JEE board bolts door to keep dummies out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 26: The joint entrance examination board has introduced a slew of changes to prevent fake candidates from taking the test after the lid was blown off a medical entrance scam.

 The changes, announced today, include revamping procedures for distribution of application forms and strengthening invigilation at examination centres.

 It will be compulsory for all candidates to put their left thumb impression on application forms and on their answer sheets. 

 It will make investigation easier if there is a complaint of impersonation, board chairman N.R. Banerjea said.

 The years-old system of using scanned photographs of examinees on their admit cards will be scrapped. Original photographs will be pasted, instead.

 The change has been introduced following complaints that the scanned photographs were often not clear and the blurred photographs enabled dummy candidates to deceive invigilators.

 Several students who had secured admission to medical colleges and their parents were arrested this year because dummy candidates, some of whom were doctors, allegedly wrote their papers.

 We are taking as many steps as possible to stop imposters from appearing in the examination, Banerjea said.

 The board has also decided to do away with the system of having scanned signatures of candidates on admit cards. 

 To make sure only genuine candidates write the exami-nations, the admit cards and the application forms will al-so contain the signature of a parent.

 A single form will be sold to an individual and a person will have to sign three payment slips to get it. One person could collect many forms earlier.

 One of the payment slips will remain with the bank where the candidates deposit the price of the form. The second slip will be with the board and the third with the candidate. 

 The candidates will have to produce the payment slip in the examination hall. 

 While buying a form, a person has to say whether it was being bought for someone else. 

 If it is indeed for someone else, the buyers signature on the counterfoil of the payment slip meant for the candidate will be matched with the boards counterfoil.

 Only college and university teachers and officers will be deputed as invigilators. There will be one for every 20 candidates.

 When the scam was exposed in July, there were complaints that a section of doctors and senior medical students had been engaged for the job.

 The board will appoint three observers for every 500 students.

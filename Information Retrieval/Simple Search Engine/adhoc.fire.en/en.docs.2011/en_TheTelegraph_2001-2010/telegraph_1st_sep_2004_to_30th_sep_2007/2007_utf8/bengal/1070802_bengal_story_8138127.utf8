 Murder for wife chat

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 1: A man stabbed to death his friend, with whom he had fallen out recently, when the latter was talking to his wife last night.

 Leather merchant Bistu Das whipped out a knife from the tool bag that he carried always and drove it into Sadhan Mondals abdomen.

 Local people at Dhantola bazaar overpowered Bistu, 35, and held onto him until police arrived.

 Recovering from the shock over the turn of events, his wife said she encountered Sadhan by chance and spoke to him for courtesys sake.

 Police said Bistu was returning home from work around 10 when he saw Sadhan talking to his wife Buli and sipping tea outside a stall. 

 Bistu stealthily walked up to them and stood behind for some time. Then he charged Sadhan with bringing his wife out of the house and lunged at him, Ranaghat subdivisional police officer Arnab Ghosh said. 

 Sadhan did not get the opportunity to tell his former friend that Buli had stepped out of their house on her own. The ferocity with which Bistu attacked Sadhan indicates that he had been suspecting his friend, Ghosh added.

 An officer of the local police station said the shocked onlookers took some time to react. By the time they go hold of Bistu, Sadhan had been stabbed several times. 

 Police questioned Buli, 25, a mother of three. She denied having any relationship with Sadhan, a trader at the bazaar, said an officer. 

 My husband gets out of the house early in the morning and returns late. I have to buy the provisions every day, she told the police.

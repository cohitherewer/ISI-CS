The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Allies differ on talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 10: An all-party meeting on Nandigram violence is all right. But the peace initiative suffered a hiccup today as the CPM and its three allies differed on whether the meeting should be held first at the district level or by the state-level leaders in Calcutta. 

 CPM wants it at the district first while the Forward Bloc, RSP and CPI today supported the Opposition Trinamul and Congress demand for a state-level meeting to restore peace in Nandigram.

 The three allies declared their preference this evening after holding parleys among themselves at the Bloc office. State Congress leader Somen Mitra went there to meet Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh.

 But the CPM is keen on a full Left Front meeting to decide the course of action. So no decision could be reached today on the date for the proposed peace meet.

 Yesterday, we thought it would be better to start with a district-level meeting. The CPM, too, wanted it. But today, we the three allies decided to go for a state-level all-party meet since there are some problems about holding it at the districts right now. The decisions of the state-level meeting will be implemented by the district leadership of all the parties, Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh said.

 The final decision would be taken after talks with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and CPM state secretary Biman Bose tomorrow, he said. Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee said tonight: I will attend the all-party meeting only if it is held at the state-level.

 Ghosh has emerged as the key peace-maker after Mamata spoke to him yesterday offering her support for the peace initiative. Both Bhattacharjee and Bose lent their weight to Ghoshs move. Today, he spoke to Congress leader Mitra and SUCI state secretary Pravash Ghosh, garnering support.

 Both Mamata and Mitra wanted a state-level meeting first and asked Ghosh to get assurance from the chief minister that the government would implement decisions of the all-party meeting. Ghosh iterated Bhattacharjees assurance.

 The CPM is not happy with the allies joining the Opposition demand for a state-level meeting. The problems are in Nandigram and not in Calcutta. If we want a useful discussion to restore peace, it should be held among those involved in Nandigram incidents. Otherwise, we have no objection to meeting state leaders of parties if it is meant for exchanging pleasantries and sipping tea together, the CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar told The Telegraph.

 If three partners want a state-level meeting, we should decide it at a full meeting of the Left Front, he added.

 According to the Front leaders, the controversy reveals the tension between the CPM and its three allies. State PWD minister and RSP veteran Kshiti Goswami accused a section of CPM leaders of trying to belittle the peace efforts of independent-minded allies, fearing loss of its political control over the front.

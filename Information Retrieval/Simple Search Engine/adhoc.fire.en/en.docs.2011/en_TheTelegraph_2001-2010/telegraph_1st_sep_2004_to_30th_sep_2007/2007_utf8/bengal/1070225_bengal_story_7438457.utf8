The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Jamait sets tongues wagging

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 24: US consul general Henry V. Jardines meeting with Jamait Ulema-i-Hind general secretary Siddiqullah Chowdhury has prompted political parties to take a fresh look at the organisations impact on the states Muslim population.

 While some argue the meeting may alienate Muslims who are hostile to Americans because of the war on Iraq, others believe it would boost Chowdhurys image in the community.

 Siddiqullah is not just a Muslim leader but a force to reckon with. He has taken a fair amount of the anti-Left space that could have gone to the Trinamul Congress. But our vote-bank is increasing steadily because of the land movement, said Trinamul MLA Partha Chatterjee. 

 Chowdhurys anti-acquisition protests had got immense support in Nandigram and Bhangar, where a large chunk of the population is Muslim. 

 According to political observers, the Jamait might see Chowdhurys meeting with Jardine as a sign that the organisation is gaining prominence.

 On the other hand, some parties feel the meeting might shrink Chowdhurys political base in minority-dominated areas. That may help the Left regain the support of Muslims who have drifted away from the CPM because of the land acquisition controversy, said an RSP leader.

 The Trinamul, however, feels otherwise. If Siddiqullahs base shrinks because of todays meeting, Mamatadi will certainly be the sole gainer as she is also fighting on the same issue, party general secretary Madan Mitra said.

 CPM central committee member Benoy Konar criticised the consuls visit. How can the US interfere in our states activities? This is an attack on our sovereignty, and they had earlier done the same in Nanoor. The matter will be discussed at our state secretariat meeting, he said.

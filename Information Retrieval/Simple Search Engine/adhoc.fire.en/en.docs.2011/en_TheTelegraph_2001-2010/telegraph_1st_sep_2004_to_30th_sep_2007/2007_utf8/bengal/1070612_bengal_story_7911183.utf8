The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Govt firm, but hope alive

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 11: A section of the CPM leadership is still exploring formulas for a deal acceptable to Mamata Banerjee despite the party refusing to negotiate on the Singur land and the Trinamul Congress ruling out talks.

 We are considering all options, including alternative jobs and additional compensation for land acquired.

 Since Jyotibabu (Basu) has advised Mamata to form a committee to negotiate with the government and she has reposed faith in his initiative, we are hopeful that some meeting ground will evolve, a CPM state secretariat member known to be close to Basu said today, indicating that some informal contact was on between the two sides.

 This is in contrast to industries minister Nirupam Sens apparent refusal to concede anything substantial under pressure from the Opposition. 

 There is nothing new except steps we have taken in accordance with our declared policy on compensation and rehabilitation for all stake-holders, including bargadars (sharecroppers) and agricultural labourers, Sen said.

 Basu today received Sens note on Singur, an aide of the patriarch confirmed. Jyotibabu has received the note. But he said he is yet to go through it, the aide said.

 Yesterday, Sen went to Basus home to convince him about the reasons behind the governments refusal to return the acquired land to unwilling farmers as demanded by Mamata. 

 Sen has made it clear that the government would not ask the Tatas to offer direct jobs and equity to land-losers in Singur as the Jindal group has done for Salboni, the site for its steel plant.

 The nature of the Tata project and opportunities for direct jobs there are different from the Jindal and DLF projects. All investors cant be expected to offer uniform compensation and rehabilitation packages, Sen said. 

 According to the CPM sources, Sens note listed the indirect jobs created by Tata Motors and the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation for the locals as they have been engaged in ongoing construction at the Singur site. His note also delves into sources of alternative livelihood to be generated after cars start rolling out next year.

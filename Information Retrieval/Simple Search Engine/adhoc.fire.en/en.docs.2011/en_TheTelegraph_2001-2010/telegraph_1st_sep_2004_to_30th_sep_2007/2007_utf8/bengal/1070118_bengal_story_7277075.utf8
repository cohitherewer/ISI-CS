The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Selective nod to direct land purchase

 Jan. 17: The government today admitted that it might allow investors to buy land directly from individual owners, but made it clear that it would depend on the scale of the project.

 It is all right to say the state will act only as a facilitator... but this model is good when the area involved is small and there arent many owners, industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said. For projects of the size of Singur, where over 17,000 landowners across nearly 1,000 acres are involved, companies cannot be expected to have the resources to spend in negotiating with individuals.

 Sajjan Jindals JSW Steel wants to buy a small portion of the 500 acres it wants for a steel plant directly from owners. The Indo-American Chamber of Commerce too has favoured the model for a proposed food park.

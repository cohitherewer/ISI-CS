The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Consultant picked to study traffic chaos

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 10: The government will ask US-headquartered Consulting Engineering Services to prepare a plan to ease the traffic congestion in Calcutta.

 The decision to draw up the comprehensive transport mobility plan was mooted after the Centre rejected the states traffic and transportation master plan because it did not address the real problems.

 The master plan had been drafted way back in 1998. Our transport infrastructure needs have changed. Weve decided to include components like the four bridges across the Hooghly and expressways in the new plan, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said today.

 The new plan is a must to get any transport project sanctioned under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission. 

 The government needs central assistance for the Rs 3,500-crore light rail transit system and projects like the Vivekananda Road flyover, the flyovers from Park Circus to Paroma Island and in Dunlop and a ramp from the AJC Bose Road flyover.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Unity plea to rivals

 Calcutta, April 21: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today appealed to Opposition parties to help build a consensus on industrialisation.

 All parties should sink their political differences and create a unanimous opinion. Otherwise, Bengal will suffer and that would affect future generations, the chief minister said at a convention organised by Left-leaning intellectuals.

 I request the Opposition not to set up bhoomi uchchhed committees at places where investors want to set up industry. Our image had suffered in the past and we should not miss the bus this time. 

 Bhattacharjee said discussions are the only way disputes can be settled. My doors are always open for dialogue on any issue. We will have to be patient and responsive and hear out every grievance of the Opposition. 

 The chief minister told the convention that all political parties have agreed on the necessity of setting up a steel plant at Purulias Raghunathpur. That makes me hopeful about steel plants slated to come up in West Midnapore and Burdwan and create employment opportunities.

 On the land acquisition row in Singur, the chief minister said it should not be clubbed with Nandigram, as a majority of villagers there had agreed to sell their lands for the Tata small-car project. Bhattacharjee offered to hold discussions on the price being offered to Singur farmers and their rehabilitation package, but said the project would not be shelved.

 I am ready to look into grievances of unwilling landlosers. But please dont ask me to move out of Singur. The entire economy of the area will change because of the project, the chief minister said.

 As for Nandigram, Bhattacharjee reiterated that the police firing was a mistake and said the government shouldnt have taken any action without telling the people how a chemical hub would have worked wonders for them. The March 14 incident was undesirable and the reaction of the people was absolutely natural, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Experts blame humans

 AVIJIT SINHA

 Siliguri, June 19: Wildlife experts feel human interference might have forced the Royal Bengal tiger out of the forest, in this case either Jaldapara or Buxa.

 Some of them also joined the railways in alleging that poachers had a hand in the death of the animal.

 Some missing nails and a tooth fuelled our doubts. We want a high-level investigation, said Ranajit Mitra of Society for Wildlife Avifaunal Nature Study, a Siliguri-based NGO.

 S.C. Dey, the secretary-general of Global Tigers Forum, however, said there have been cases of tigers being hit by trains. But in Bengal, it seems to be the first incident in the past 50 years, Dey said over phone from Delhi. 

 Officials of Project Tiger, under the Union ministry of environment and forests, feel loss of habitat might have forced the tiger out of the jungle. 

 In the past few years, Buxa has suffered a depletion of 14 sqkm of forest cover, an official said. Added to this are the pressures of people residing close to tiger reserves and wildlife sanctuaries.

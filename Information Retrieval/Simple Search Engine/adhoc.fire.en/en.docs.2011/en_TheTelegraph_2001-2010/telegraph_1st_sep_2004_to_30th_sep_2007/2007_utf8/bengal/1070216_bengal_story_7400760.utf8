 Girl-sale arrest

 Krishnagar, Feb. 15: A 52-year-old man and his married daughter were arrested last night from Nadias Ranaghat on the charge of selling off a 16-year-old girl in Mumbai, reports our correspondent.

 The father and the daughter were arrested from Coopers Camp, about 70 km from Calcutta, after around 500 villagers thrashed them and complained to police that the duo lured the girl with the promise that she would be trained as a dancer in Mumbai. 

 The girl, Sumita Sarkar (name changed), left her home in Coopers Camp on January 10 and has been missing since then.

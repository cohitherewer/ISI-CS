 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, May 19: A police constable and his wife were arrested today for duping a woman out of Rs 50,000. 

 Police said Gopal Saha and Uma had taken the money from Madhumita Nath, a resident of Baranagar in North 24-Parganas, promising to help her get a job in Calcutta police as a constable. 

 Madhumita filed a police complaint saying the couple did not keep their word. The girl also mentioned that Gopal had once told her to come to the Barrackpore police training centre with him and molested her on the way, an officer said.

 Midnapore: Baidyanath Chowdhury, 67, was killed after being swept away by a 12-metre-high wave in Digha on Saturday morning.

 The wave broke on Chowdhury and his family as they were taking pictures on the beach and pulled them into the sea.

 Rescuers fished out the rest of the family, but there was no trace of Chowdhury, a retired income-tax officer from Calcutta. His body floated ashore around 3 in the afternoon.

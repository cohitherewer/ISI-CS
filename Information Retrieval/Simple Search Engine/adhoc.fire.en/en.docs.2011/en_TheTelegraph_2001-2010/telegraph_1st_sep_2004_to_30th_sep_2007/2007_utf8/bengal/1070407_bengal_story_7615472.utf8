The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cong not shy of Mamata

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 6: Mamata Banerjee today renewed her call to the Congress to join her anti-acquisition movement. 

 I call upon the state Congress to join the Krishijomi Raksha (Save Farmland) Committee, in which there is no BJP, she told a news conference at her Kalighat home.

 The Trinamul Congress chief added that the Congress will be invited to her April 13 rally at Esplanade to condemn the mass killings in Nandigram. 

 The Congress warmed to Mamatas announcement but said the Trinamul chief must send a written invite. 

 State party working president Pradip Bhattacharya said the Congress was ready to overlook Mamatas BJP ties. We have no reservations ab- out joining her platform. But we expect a letter from her, he added.

 Trinamul sources said Mamata will soon send the rally invites to the SUCI, Congress and other like-minded parties.

 Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee went a step ahead of his party boss, saying there was no point insisting on a written invitation. We should latch on to Mamatas offer to salvage our image, which has been tarnished because of our lackadaisical movement against land acquisition.

 The beleaguered state Congress appeared desperate to piggyback on Mamata when former state party chief Somen Mitra said it was high time to stitch together an alliance with Mamata against the governments drive to forcibly acquire farmland. 

 At a rally in Nadia, Mitra said he felt ashamed for having failed to launch a vigorous movement after the Nandigram killings. Weve lost our credibility and must find out a way to get closer to the people, he added. 

 Mamata recalled the Congresss early association with the anti-acquisition forum. But perhaps the Congress central leadership does not like to antagonise the CPM for its support to the UPA government, she said.

 She also accused the Congress of adopting a forked policy. It took the NDAs help for the Malda Lok Sabha bypoll last year. But I dont know why it stayed away from the anti-acquisition movement, Mamata said.

 A save farmland team called on the governor this afternoon and said they apprehend a fresh attack on Nandigram villagers by CPM cadres.

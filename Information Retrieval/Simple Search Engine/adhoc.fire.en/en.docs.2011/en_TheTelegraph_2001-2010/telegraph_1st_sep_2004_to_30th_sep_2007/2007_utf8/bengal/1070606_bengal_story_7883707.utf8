 Santiniketan land-fill probe

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 5: The high court today appointed a special officer to visit a Santiniketan water body that is allegedly being filled up for the construction of an ecological park.

 Advocate Jayanta Mitra has to file a report on the 17.7-acre lake with pictures to back his findings within three weeks.

 The order, by the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice K.J. Sengupta, followed a petition by author-activist Mahasweta Devi, actor-director Aparna Sen and a host of others who have houses in the university town.

 They alleged that the Sriniketan-Santiniketan Development Authority had allowed Surji Construction to build the amusement park by filling the Lohabandh lake. The park, they contended, would disturb the ecological balance of the area and destroy forever the tranquillity of Santiniketan, Tagores abode of peace.

 The petition was moved in 2004. The lawyer for the petitioners alleged that the authority is also allowing housing and other projects in the area.

 The authoritys counsel denied allowing the construction company to fill the water body. No construction will be made on the water body, he said.

 The court will take a final decision based on the special officers report.

 Construction of the Phase II of the housing project, Sonar Tari near Prantik station was also challenged. This case is still pending.

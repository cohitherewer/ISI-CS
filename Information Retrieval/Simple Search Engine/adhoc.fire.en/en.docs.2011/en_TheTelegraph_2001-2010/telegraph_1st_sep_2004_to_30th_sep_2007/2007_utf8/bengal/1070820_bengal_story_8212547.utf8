 Bag with three bombs in Howrah

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Howrah, Aug. 19: Three bombs with great potential to cause devastation were found in a black folio bag behind a mill in Howrahs Dasnagar this afternoon.

 Most of Alamohan Das Road did not have a clue to the close shave, though, when the area shook up with the deafening sound of an explosion, triggered by the CIDs bomb disposal squad.

 Had the bombs gone off, the devastation would have been great if not massive. Although handmade, the bombs were not the usual types that we find on criminals. The explosives were of very high grade, something which we didnt quite expect, a senior officer of the Dasnagar police station said.

 Residents spotted the bag in the lane behind Arati Cotton Mill around 2pm. 

 It had three tin cans wrapped in cello-tape. They immediately called the police station, a few yards away.

 Our officers took a close look at the bag and decided to call experts. The cans did not seem to contain anything, but we didnt want to take a chance. So we cordoned off the area and informed the CID, the officer said.

 The CID experts turned up almost three hours later and placed huge sandbags about 90 feet from the spot on each side to keep onlookers at bay.

 The officers put a water jet inside the bag, connected it to a battery and pressed the trigger. The bombs made a deafening sound as they went off. We shudder to think what would have happened had they exploded accidentally, a senior officer said.

 The police said some local gangs use tin-bombs, but their impact is far less than that of the explosives found today. A probe has been started, the officer added.

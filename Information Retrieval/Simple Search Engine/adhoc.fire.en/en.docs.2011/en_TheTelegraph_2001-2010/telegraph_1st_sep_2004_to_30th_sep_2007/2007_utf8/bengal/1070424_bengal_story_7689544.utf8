The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Malda, April 23: Three men were lynch-ed after their attempt to snatch a bag containing Rs 12,000 from a rice trader failed at the Englishbazar market this morning. Instead of getting scared at the sight of seven armed men, Gupinath Saha raised an alarm and a mob surrounded them. The goons fired while trying to flee but the three were caught.

 Calcutta: The high court has asked the pollution control board to maintain status-quo on its notice to disconnect power and water conn-ections to four hotels at Mandarmani, about 30 km from Digha. The cuts had been ordered as the hotels are within 200 meters of the sea.

 Calcutta: A petition demanding compensation for the victims of the Nandigram firing was admitted by the high court on Monday.

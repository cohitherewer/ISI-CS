The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Govt admits bullet deaths, not police killing

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, April 11: The 

 government informed the high court today that 10 people 

 died of bullet injuries in Nandigram on March 14. 

 However, the affidavit did not clarify whether they had all fallen to police bullets.

 Fourteen people died when the police tried to enter Bhangabera and Adhikaripara in the face of resistance from around 2,500 villagers. 

 Hospital authorities in Nandigram said four persons had died of stab wounds and injuries suffered in blasts.

 I iterate that from hospital records, it transpired that 30 people, including the 10 dead, had received bullet injuries, home department joint secretary Sukumar Bhattacharyya said.

 He also said three cases were started on allegations of rape and molestation, but none of the charges had been confirmed.

 Bhattacharyya was resp-onding to a petition filed by a Nandigram resident saying that indiscriminate police firing on March 14 had led to the death of 16 people and injured over 100. 

 The petition had also alleged that policemen raped 16 women that day.

 Shortly after filing the affidavit, inspector-general of police (law and order) Raj Kanojia said: To begin with, we take no responsibility for those who did not die of bullet injuries. Those bodies could have been brought to the Nandigram hospital from anywhere. As for those who died of bullet injuries, not all may have been our bullets. The matter would have to be investigated.

 The police had been contending that villagers gathered across a bridge at Bhangabera and fired at them, provoking a retaliation. The armed villagers were behind rows of women and children whom they were using as human shields, an officer said. Its a distinct possibility that they hit people on their own side in the melee.

 Once the police fired in retaliation, there was total confusion among the villagers with everyone running for cover. We believe some of them got killed by bullets fired by their own side. 

 The deaths from blasts prove that the villagers had bombs in their arsenal, the police said. Some of them could have missed their target and hit the villagers, instead.

 The police were neither carrying daggers nor bombs, Kanojia said. 

 Many villagers, however, have debunked the police claim that they opened fire, saying if that had been the case, at least one policeman would have been injured. They also said that CPM cadres armed with bombs and daggers had joined forces with the police. 

 East Midnapore police chief A.G. Srinivas and CID deputy inspector-general N.N. Pandey met the human rights commission today to clarify certain aspects of the report on the firing and the allegations of rape.

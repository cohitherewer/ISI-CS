The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bloc bid to build market muscle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 24: The Forward Bloc wants control of all markets in Bengal to be handed to the state marketing board, an organisation run by the party.

 The Bloc will request the state government to expand its authority. We will write to the chief minister and municipal affairs minister to facilitate the transfer of control of all traditional haats (weekly village markets) and private markets to us so that we can develop the marketing infrastructure in a planned manner, board chairman and Bloc leader Naren Chatterjee said. 

 He claimed that the state Agri-produce Marketing Regulation Act, 1972, empowers the board to oversee all markets. Of the 2,900 haats and bazaars, the board controls only 150. This is in addition to the 46 regulated by the state.

 The move comes when Reliance Industries has expressed interest in collaborating with the CMC to renovate 23 markets run by the city civic body.

 The marketing board has blocked Reliances retail plan by deferring a decision on its application for a licence. 

 Expanding its control will help the board pre-empt Reliance and other corporate groups from entering Bengals markets, both retail and wholesale. We dont need a Reliance to set up 500 cold strorages in Bengal, Chatterjee said. 

 Reliance wants to make direct purchases from farmers and sell the items through its retail chain.

 On Monday, the board asked the state-run market committees not to issue licences to Reliance without its permission. 

 Already, the boards permission is mandatory to sell farm products in Howrah and Calcutta.

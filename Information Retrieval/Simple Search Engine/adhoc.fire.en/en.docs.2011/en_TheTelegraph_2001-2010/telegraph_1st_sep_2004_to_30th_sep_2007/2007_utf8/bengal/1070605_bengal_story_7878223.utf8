 Durgapur June 4: The steel executives wife who was arrested on the charge of torturing a 12-year-old domestic help was released on bail today.

 Gobardhan Mahato has accused Purvita Ramaiya, the wife of a senior manager at Durgapur Steel Plant, of regularly hitting him with serving spoons and sharp-edged utensils, and sometimes denying him food and water.

 The 40-year-old housewife has also been charged with violating the Child Labour Act, which forbids hiring workers aged below 14. 

 Police today recorded Gobardhans statement, after which his mother, Bilasi, took him back to Onda village in Purulia this afternoon. 

 Gobardhan, however, wasnt looking forward to going home, where his father, a daily labourer, toils to feed a family of seven with Rs 30-40 a day. 

 When I got the job, I thought I would get two square meals a day. But I was beaten up and tortured. Now I will again become a burden on my poor father, he wept. 

 Circle inspector Pannalal Goswami said: Although the accused has been given bail, our investigations will continue. We are also probing whether her husband, too, had a hand in torturing the boy.

 Purvitas husband Murlikrishna refused to comment.

 Purvita will have to appear before Durgapur additional chief judicial magistrate M.S. Tripathi on June 18, when the case will be heard.

 The steel plant authorities brushed it off as an isolated incident. Our employees are conscious about their social duties and responsibilities, said B.R. Kanungo, the chief of communications.

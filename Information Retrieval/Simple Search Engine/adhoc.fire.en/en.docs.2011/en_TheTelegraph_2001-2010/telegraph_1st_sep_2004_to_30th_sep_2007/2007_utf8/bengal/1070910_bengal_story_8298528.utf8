The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Son wants brutal family in jail

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Jyotsna Das

 Calcutta, Sept. 9: Shyamal Das wants exemplary punishment for his family members.

 His policewoman wife, nine months pregnant, was pinned to the ground and beaten up by her in-laws yesterday.

 Shyamal, a civil engineer, vowed never to forgive his mother, brother and sister for their brutality, standing next to his wifes bed in hospital. 

 Doctors said Jyotsnas condition was stable. Tests will reveal the babys condition tomorrow.

 Jyotsna has been shifted out of the ICU. 

 I saw them (mother, brother and sister) holding my wifes hands and legs while others (his sisters-in-law and nephews) were kicking and punching her, he said. 

 Shyamals elder brother Madhusudan was granted bail by the Alipore court today.

 Of the eight named in the FIR, seven are in hiding. I want to see all of them behind bars, Shyamal said.

 When he returned from work last evening and saw his wife being beaten up, he cried for help. I shouted at the top of my voice and neighbours came running. I took Jyotsna to the ICU of Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratisthan with their help, he added.

 Over 200 residents of the Tiljala neighbourhood staged a demonstration alleging that the police were deliberately not arresting the accused. 

 They also said Madhusudan, an active CPM supporter, had got bail easily because he was booked on lighter charges. Javed Khan, the Trinamul Congress MLA from Ballygunge, promised a bigger movement if the accused were not arrested.

 The police said a hunt was on for the missing seven.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bricks in airport cellphone box

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 18: Cellphone boxes that arrived here from Bangkok early this morning had brickbats packed in them when they were taken for clearance tonight.

 Nine cartons, each supposed to contain 90 mobile phones, reached the Calcutta airport at 4 this morning by a Thai Airways plane.

 Air India personnel, who do ground handling for Thai Airways, took two cartons for the mandatory clearances from the cargo hold area around 8.30pm and found that their seals had been broken.

 A peep into the boxes revealed the actual contents. 

 A senior airport official said a probe has been started. Several airport employees were being questioned as it was likely that the seals on the cardboard boxes were tampered with here.

 Officials, who could not recall any incident of the sort earlier, said the other cartons would be opened on Monday.

 Ground handling staff at the airport were held responsible for a recent spurt in thefts from passengers baggage. Laptops, cellphones, cash, camera, cosmetics and even clothes have gone missing.

 Bag scare

 An airline security official left his airport colleagues red-faced today when he left behind his kit bag, triggering a bomb scare in the domestic terminal.

 Jet Airways employee Srikant Parab left his bag in front of the ticketing counter.

 CISF personnel spotted it around 5.15pm, cordoned off the area and ordered five Jet employees in the counter to get out.

 A bomb disposal squad took the bag to a safe place and found books and clothes. An all-clear was signalled at 6.

 Parab, who came from Mumbai to appear in a Bur- eau of Civil Aviation Safety examination, took an evening flight home. It seems he forgot the bag in a hurry, an airport official said.

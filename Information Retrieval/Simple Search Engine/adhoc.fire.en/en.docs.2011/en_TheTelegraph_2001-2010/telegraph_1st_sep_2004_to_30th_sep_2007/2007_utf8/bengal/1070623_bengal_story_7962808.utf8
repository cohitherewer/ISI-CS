The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cong unity call to Trinamul

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 22: The Congress today used the Left Fronts 30-year milestone to renew its appeal to the Trinamul Congress to join forces and prevent division of votes.

 Mamata Banerjee broke away from the Congress 10 years ago and formed Trinamul. That led to a division in Opposition votes, which helped the CPM-led Left Front stay in power. So, I appeal to the Trinamul to join forces with the Congress as it would help create a secular front, which can oust the Left Front from power, state Congress general secretary Manas Bhuniya said. 

 According to Bhuniya, the Congress is committed to fight the CPM in Bengal, for which it needs the Trinamuls support. Trinamul has to be part of any Opposition coalition, but without the BJP. There has to be a combined Opposition platform to take on the CPM. If the Trinamul leadership fails to realise this, we will have to remain satisfied as Opposition parties.

 Leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee retorted that Mamata had formed the Trinamul as the Congress had lost the credibility to fight the CPM. Besides, people had lost faith in the party after the Left decided to support the UPA at the Centre, he said.

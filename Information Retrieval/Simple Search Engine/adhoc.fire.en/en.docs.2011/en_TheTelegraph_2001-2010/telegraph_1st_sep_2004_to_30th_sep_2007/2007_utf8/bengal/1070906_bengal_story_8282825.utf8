 Nakashipara, Sept. 5: Students 

 and teachers kicked a football outside a Nadia school for 

 some time and wrapped up Teachers Day because CPM 

 leaders had shut them out of the institution.

 The local CPM unit was holding a conference inside.

 Nakashipara High School had decided to celebrate the day for the first time in its 55 years. 

 But when hundreds of children and their teachers arrived around seven this morning, the main gate was shut. 

 When they pushed it open, the school was teeming with party workers, buntings, posters, flags and festoons. 

 Headmaster Amit Dutta suggested to the students that they play football with the teachers, instead of going to class and garlanding them.

 What else could we? asked Dutta, who had given the party permission to hold the meeting today.

 The students had lined up an elaborate programme for what would have been their Teachers Day debut. Wed have felicitated the teachers and made them sit on our benches and hear us lecture, said Santanu Saha of Class VI.

 Ajoy Singha Roy, whose daughter is in Class VI, looked into her moist eyes and said: This is not done. No one cares about how the children feel.

 District inspector of schools Dilip Khanra said what Dutta did was illegal. Well ask for a report. 

 The CPM said it was not told that the school was to have a programme today. The party never pressured the school for classrooms, said district secretariat member S.M. Sadi, who was in the school today.

 But the guardians were not convinced. Our representatives had attended the mana- ging committee meeting that decided to celebrate Teachers Day, Roy said. 

 Managing committee secretary Hirak Sarkar admitted that some guardians had objected to the schools decision.

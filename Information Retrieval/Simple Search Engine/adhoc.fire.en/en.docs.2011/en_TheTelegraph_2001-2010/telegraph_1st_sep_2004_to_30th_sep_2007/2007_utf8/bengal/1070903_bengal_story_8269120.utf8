 Techie hunt after wife goes to cops

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Sept. 2: A young software engineer working in a private bank allegedly ditched his pregnant wife to marry another girl for a hefty dowry.

 Police are looking for Dipankar Talabi.

 Ruma (name changed), a customer care executive at the same Kalyani branch where her husband works, lodged a police complaint yesterday. 

 The woman, a resident of Majdia in Krishnagunj, 120km from Calcutta, had known Dipankar, who lives in nearby Naghata, from childhood. 

 They secretly got married last week.

 But the woman alleged that her businessman father-in-law refused to accept her as another girls family was offering Rs 70,000 and jewellery and electronic gadgets worth well over a lakh.

 Father-in-law Dinabandhu has been arrested. Dipankar is currently absconding. He is accused of cheating his wife, who is five months pregnant, said Santanu Bose, the officer in charge of Krishnagunj police station. 

 The officer said Dipankars second marriage was slated for November. 

 Ruma, who passed BA this year, said Dipankar, an MCA from Haldia Engineering College, helped her get the bank job. I dont know how an educated man could ditch his wife for dowry, she said. 

 Dipankar earns around Rs 25,000 a month. 

 Rumas father, a government employee, said the Talabis threw him out of their house when he went to meet them.

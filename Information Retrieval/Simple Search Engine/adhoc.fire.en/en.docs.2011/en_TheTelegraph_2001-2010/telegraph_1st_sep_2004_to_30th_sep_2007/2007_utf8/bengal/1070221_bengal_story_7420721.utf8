 Peace on test in Nandigram

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Feb. 20: Nandigrams children wrote their Ma-dhyamik first paper in peace today.

 About 600 students from the region that witnessed a bloodbath early last month, and frequent skirmishes over the governments industrialisation drive since, appeared for their first board exam today.

 Children on both sides of the divide suffered because of their elders. If Raju Gharai and Manasi Das, whose families support the CPM, had been rendered homeless, Shabnam Khatun and Sheikh Tahir were unable to focus on studies because of the tension.

 Roads are still dug up and there were reports of bombing and gunfights even on Sunday. 

 The Haldia subdivisional officer held an all-party meeting last evening and appealed for peace during the exams. 

 I toured the exam centres and spoke to candidates and guardians. Every ones been co-operative, block development officer Ashok Sarkar said. 

 Planks were laid across trenches on the road at several places.

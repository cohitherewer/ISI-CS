 Darjeeling, Aug. 19: BSNLs increased rates for sending SMS votes to television talent hunts have the hills up in arms. 

 Fans of Prashant Tamang and Karma Sherpa, the singers from Darjeeling who have reached the final rounds of Sonys Indian Idol and Zee TVs Sa Re Ga Ma Pa, will now have to spend Rs 3.50 to vote for them. A text message costs Rs 1.50 and Rs 2 is charged for confirmation that the vote has been registered. 

 Till last week, the charge was Rs 3, and when the show began around three months ago, it was only Re 1.

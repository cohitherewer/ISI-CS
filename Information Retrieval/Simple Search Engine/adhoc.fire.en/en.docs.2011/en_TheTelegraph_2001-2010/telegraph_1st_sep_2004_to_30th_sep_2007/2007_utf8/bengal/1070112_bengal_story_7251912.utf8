The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CM in salvage meet

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Jan. 11: Forty-eight hours after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said the government was ready to initiate a dialogue to calm tempers in Nandigram, he met representatives of a group of Muslim organisations.

 No such gesture was extended when there was a protest at Singur against land acquisition for the Tata Motors small-car project.

 We are happy over Bhattacharjees announcement that mosques, burial grounds and our dwelling places will not be touched while acquiring land for the Salim Groups special economic zone at Nandigram, Qari Fazlur Rahaman, president of the All India Milli Council said at Writers Buildings after the meeting.

 He (Bhattacharjee) also dismissed the allegation that only land belonging to the Muslim community is being targeted for acquisition. Instead, he said land will be acquired based on the requirements of the industries concerned, Rahaman added.

 According to Rahaman, the chief minister also made it clear during the hour-long meeting that he did not intend to accuse the Jamat-e-Ulema Hind of being communal. In fact, he stressed the organisations long association with the countrys freedom struggle. But the chief minster objected to the manner in which it carried out a campaign at Nandigram.

 Bhattacharjee admitted that the blunder that led to Sundays violence at Nandigram was committed by one officer. But henceforth, he (Bhattacharjee) will take everybody into confidence and a land map will be prepared before acquiring land, said Suleman Khurshid, the Muslim Institutes general secretary, who was also present at the meeting.

 Khurshid requested Bhattacharjee to constitute a committee comprising representatives from all communities to discuss the problems arising out of land acquisition.

 The chief minister said the state would fully implement the recommendations of the Sachar committee.

 Though the chief minister was not available for comment on the meeting, his observations are being seen as an attempt to woo Muslims, the majority of whom is unhappy after the Nandigram clashes.

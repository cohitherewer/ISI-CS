The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Poll-wary CM in a hurry

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Bhattacharjee: Busy

 Calcutta, Aug. 22: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee appears to have pressed the accelerator on major industrial projects in view of the political uncert- ainty at the Centre. 

 He skipped the CPM central committee gathering to discuss support to the Centre and instead chose to preside over a cabinet meeting to clear a slew of projects and a cabinet core committee huddle to iron out policy differences among Left Front partners. 

 A senior minister said the chief minister was worried about the political turmoil in Delhi while reporting to his colleagues the status of big projects such as the chemical hub. 

 Our projects are OK. But my experience in Delhi was not good this time. Its not certain how long this government will survive. They have entered into an agreement with the Americans and are finding it difficult to come out of it while it is equally difficult for us to accept the deal, Bhattacharjee was quoted as saying. 

 The possibility of a snap poll if Manmohan Singh goes ahead with the nuclear deal appears to have made Bhattacharjee push hard for his pet projects, felt the CPMs allies.

 Meetings have been lined up accordingly. The all-party meeting on the chemical hub is slated for September 3. On September 6 or 7, Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel will discuss the modernisation of Calcutta airport. The feasibility study for the deep-sea port has got the nod and efforts are on to get projects related to several central institutes cleared. 

 Although the chief minister had a tiff with RSP leader and PWD minister Kshiti Goswami at the core committee over the hubs possible toxic hazards, the allies felt that his decision to set up an expert panel to assess its environmental impact was aimed at placating the allies and the Opposition. 

 Officially, the CPM has delinked Bengals industrialisation from the survival of the Congress-led government. But party leaders admitted that the Lefts new-found clout in Delhi had helped Bhattacharjee garner support for projects like the port and the Petroleum Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Region.

 That is why Bengal CPM leaders, including Jyoti Basu and Biman Bose, had ruled out mid-term polls after the nuke row snowballed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata pat on Basu back

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 16: Mamata Banerjee today showered praise on Jyoti Basu for condemning the Nandigram massacre and for ticking off the CPM.

 Jyoti Basu is a fatherly figure and a senior politician. He has spoken his mind over the unjustified police firing and correctly chastised the party for its arrogance and indecent behaviour, the Trinamul Congress chief told a news conference at her Kalighat home this afternoon.

 A Left Front leader had yesterday quoted the former chief minister as saying at a meeting that he had heard some people were shot from the back while they were fleeing. Where was the need for so much firing when none of the policemen sustained any bullet injury? he reportedly asked.

 Basu today clarified that he had not said the police fired on the villagers without any provocation.

 If Basu got a pat on the back, his successor was dubbed a killer chief minister. Mamata said the Trinamul would spearhead a movement involving all political parties to demand Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees resignation. He should own moral responsibility for the massacre at Nandigram, she added. 

 Mamata appealed to all parties, including disgruntled Left Front allies, to join forces with the Trinamul-led Save Farmland Committee to strengthen the anti-land acquisition agitation across Bengal. Today, front allies have started voicing their resentment against the CPMs one-party rule. So, our allegation was right.

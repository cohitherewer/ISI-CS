The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, May 2: A newborn died in a Southern Avenue nursing home tonight because of an anaesthesia overdose to the mother. 

 The authorities admitted negligence by the doctor. The condition of the mother is said to be critical.

 Uluberia: Bengal needs a chemical hub to bridge the gap between demand and supply of pharmaceutical products, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said on Wednesday. In Bengal, there is an ann-ual market of around Rs 25,000 crore for such products. But our produce is worth only Rs 500 crore, he said while opening a unit of Medeor Pharma at an industry hub here, 40 km from Calcutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 DLF job for landlosers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 8: A concern sweeping boardrooms was reflected again today when DLF promised one job for a member of every family to be displaced by the Dankuni township.

 The governments pact with the real estate company in February for the 4,870-acre project had promised preferential employment for displaced people.

 Today, DLF said it has committed a job to each of the 600 families to be evicted for the Rs 33,000-crore project.

 Only a week ago, the Jindals promised a job for every landloser family and stakes in its steel plant in Salboni, West Midnapore.

 The Prime Minister had recently preached inclusive growth to corporates, urging them to ensure every strata of the society benefitted from growth. 

 Since the scope of employment is so huge, one member from each family will surely get a job. It is good for us and good for them, said A.S Minocha, chairman of DLF Commercial Developers.

 In the city for a road show on DLFs forthcoming public issue, Minocha said the company also plans to develop some schools in the area and build medical centres as part of its social obligation. 

 The township is about 15 km from Calcutta and not far from Singur, where a section of landlosers is still waging war against the government.

 DLF has already promised plots or flats at nominal rates for the displaced. Those living below poverty line will get them free. It will fund the education of children from these families up to Class X and ITI training for one student from each family.

 The company has paid Rs 55 lakh an acre to bag the project which includes textile, food processing and light engineering units through an international auction. 

 DLF wants to build a 200-acre township in Siliguri and hotels, service apartments and IT parks elsewhere.

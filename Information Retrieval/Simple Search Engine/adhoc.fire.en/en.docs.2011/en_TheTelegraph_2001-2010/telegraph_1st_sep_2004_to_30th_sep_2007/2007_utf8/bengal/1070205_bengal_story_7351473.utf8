 Asansol, Feb. 4: Murder, gambling, robbery, arms running, wagon breaking, kidnapping Rail Paar Mohalla on the outskirts of Asansol town had many claims to fame. 

 Investigation into any crime in the town would lead to the slum one way or the other and police were scared to conduct raids since an officer was shot while leading one in 1997.

 A peoples initiative and a little help from the authorities have changed much of that in a few years. 

 Dreaded criminals now run shops and their children go to school where they learn computers among other subjects.

 There are about 70 families at Rail Paar Mohalla its men rickshaw-pullers, bootleggers, butchers, quacks or criminals.

 Towards the end of the 1990s, some residents of the town, social workers, teachers, doctors, political parties and the police chalked out the plan to bring the goons back to the mainstream. 

 An NGO, Faiz-e-Aam (development for all), was set up.

 As a first step, a vacant two-and-a-half-cottah plot that used to be a gambling and drinking den was transformed into a childrens park. 

 In 2000, we created the patch of green, said Bastav Baidya, the Asansol additional superintendent of police. 

 There was no looking back. An art school, a study centre for both children and adults, a computer centre and a football field followed. 

 Around 200 boys and girls who study at the school are children of known criminals who have reformed themselves, said Abdus Salam, a doctor and a co-ordinator of Faiz-e-Aam.

 The task wasnt easy. We regularly spoke to those who were out on bail. We told them that their criminal image was not good for their children, who were growing up, said Salam.

 His mate in this mission, Rashid Anwar, a madarsa teacher, said many of the criminals were keen to lead a decent life. Many were not so keen but thought of giving it a try for the sake of their children. 

 They needed guidance, which we provided, Anwar said.

 Pakar Ansari, 58, a former arms dealer, runs a leather goods shop now. His sons have been trained in making leather bags. 

 Im out on bail and facing trial, but I feel so good about the fact that I have left crime to earn my bread in a respectable way, he said.

 Shamim Khan, 55, who is facing several wagon-breaking charges, has set up a hardware shop. 

 Eighteen-year-old Mustafa Ali, whose father Sarafat is also being tried for wagon-breaking, has taken to computers seriously. They are good, said the Class X student of the school set up by the NGO.

 Weve also got a football ground. Being children of goondas gave us a complex earlier. Not now, he added.

 Six years ago, there were 10 murders a year in Asansol. In 2006, there was none, a police officer said.

 Even two years ago, a police team raiding Rail Paar Mohalla would find at least 15 illegal firearms and bombs. Recent raids have not yielded any, Burdwan superintendent Peeyush Pandey said.

 Mohammad Basir, 25, used to find customers for illegal arms and would tip off bigger goons about police raids. Now he is being trained to make handicrafts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Allies frown on DLF land lease

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 22: After opposing the land reforms amendment bill aimed at relaxing the land ceiling for industry, Left allies have raised objections to the governments 999-year lease of 4,840 acres for the Dankuni township project to the Delhi-based DLF group.

 The allies complained that the 999-year lease has been given to circumvent their opposition to the bill, which also allows the private sector to sell acquired land. The issue came up today during the CPM-RSP bilateral talks on the land bill.

 Yesterday, the CPI had also voiced objections to the tenure of the lease on the land acquired by the government.

 The RSP leaders drew chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees attention to the lease deal between the CMDA and the DLF group.

 They pointed out that though the group would pay around Rs 2,700 crore as cost of the land, it would pay only Re 1 as annual rent. 

 They felt the government sold the land to the group under the garb of lease.

 According to those who took part in the talks, Bhattacharjee promised to look into the matter and asked urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya about the issue. 

 The minister later said the state cabinet had approved the agreement with the DLF and the terms would be reviewed, if needed.

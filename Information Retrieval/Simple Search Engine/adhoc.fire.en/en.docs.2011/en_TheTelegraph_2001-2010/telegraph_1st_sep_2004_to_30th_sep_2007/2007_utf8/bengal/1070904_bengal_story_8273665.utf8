The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Letter to PM for Nobel

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 3: Visva-Bharati has written to the President, the Prime Minister, and the governor for necessary action, days after the CBI said it was closing the probe into the Nobel medal theft. 

 Asking the CBI to continue with the investigation into the heist is not in our hands. I have appealed to my superiors the visitor, the rector and the chancellor to take necessary action, vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Roy said.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is the chancellor of the university, President Pratibha Patil is the visitor and governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi the rector.

 In Calcutta, Mamata Banerjee said she would meet Singh next week to seek a clarification on why the CBI was not pursuing the case. 

 The matter is not closed. Every effort will be made to recover the medal and other stolen memorabilia, Roy said, refusing to elaborate on what effort he intended to undertake.

 The director of Rabindra Bhavan, Swapan Majumdar, appealed to the thief to return the medal at a news conference today. Majumdars office address was provided for the thiefs benefit.

 Mamata saw a CPM hand behind the CBI decision. The CBI is faced with threats and pressure from CPM and the state government. Ill ask the Prime Minister why such things are happening. The CBI works under his supervision, Mamata said.

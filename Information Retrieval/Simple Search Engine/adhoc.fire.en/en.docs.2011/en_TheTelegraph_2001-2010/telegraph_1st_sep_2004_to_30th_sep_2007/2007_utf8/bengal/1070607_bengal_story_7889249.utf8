The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Court papers delay relief

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 6: Any possible legal relief for the starving thousands of north Bengal has got stuck in a maze of court procedures.

 An SOS to the Supreme Court 10 months ago by workers of ailing tea gardens and NGOs has done little to bring relief. 

 A survey conducted by the Jalpaiguri health department in 14 closed estates revealed that 571 people have died bet-ween January 1, 2006, and March 31, 2007. 

 Of them, 409 were below 60, the national average life span.

 The petitioners Paschim Banga Khet Majdoor Samiti and four other associations had wanted the court to direct the Centre to take measures to stem the deprivation. 

 The central government can take over ailing and closed gardens under the tea act.

 Last August, the apex court issued notices to the Centre, the Tea Board of India and several tea-growing states, including Bengal. 

 Of the 14 respondents, many are apparently yet to receive the notice, because of which the case cannot be listed for hearing. 

 The delay is costing the tea workers dear. More than 17,000 workers in 18 tea gardens of north Bengal are yet to get Rs 36.6 crore as dues. 

 The minimum daily wage for plantation workers has been fixed at Rs 53.90 other dailywagers get Rs 68 as they are entitled to subsidised rations, free electricity, me-dical, housing and other faci-lities. 

 But none of these are available in the closed estates.

 The situation is not any better in other states like Assam, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Karnataka and Uttarakhand, the petitioners told the court. 

 Several owners have abandoned their gardens without paying wages and statutory dues such as gratuity, closure and retrenchment compensation and provident funds.

 The petitoners had contended that the Union government, the tea board, the provident fund commissioner and the gratuity controller were duty-bound to protect the interests of the workers under the provisions of the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952.

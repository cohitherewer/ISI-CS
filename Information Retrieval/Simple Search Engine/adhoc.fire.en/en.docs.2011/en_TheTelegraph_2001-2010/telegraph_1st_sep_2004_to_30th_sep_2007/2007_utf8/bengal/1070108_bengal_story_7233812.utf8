 Calcutta, Jan. 7: After a night of bloodbath, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state CPM secretary Biman Bose appealed for peace and an amicable settlement of the dispute over land for industry. 

 Realising that the violence would further slow down the governments drive, Bose distanced himself from party hawks like Benoy Konar and Lakshman Seth and sought an all-party initiative to contain the tension. 

 Bhattacharjee and Bose urged people to foil the bandh tomorrow. 

 Konar iterated that the CPM would call for armed retaliation if the Oppositions terror campaign continues. 

 However, he admitted that the Haldia Development Authoritys notice to block offices listing the 29 mouzas where land would be acquired sparked the tension among farmers, helping the Opposition harvest it. Tamluk MP Seth chairs the authority.

 Addressing a rally of the partys youth wing in Calcutta, the chief minister tried to assure the farmers of Nandigram that though the government needs 22,000 acres for two SEZs in the area, no move has been initiated for land acquisition and that everything would be done in consultation with panchayats. 

 We will take everything in account so that homes, mosques, temples are safe, he said.

 Some people have been misguided. I have told the administration to ensure that there is no violence and have asked police to be patient. We are restrained and we urge the Opposition to shun violence and join talks. 

 He accused the Opposition of shying from talks on Singur after demanding it for days.

 Bose alleged that supporters of the Krishi Jomi Banchao Committee had attacked CPM supporters camping in Khejuri last night. 

 Trinamul, SUCI and the Naxalites had together incited villagers by spreading the rumour of acquisition. Road links to 21 villages were severed. Some of our party and panchayat offices were ransacked and torched. Despite that we told our supporters to remain calm and quiet, Bose said. 

 Since our people were cornered last night, they defended themselves, he added, virtually admitting the partys role in the violence. 

 According to him, three CPM supporters Shankar Samanta, Rabin Bhuniya and Biswajit Maiti were killed and 10 are missing. We heard two Trinamul supporters also died, he added.

 Unlike Konar, Bose refused to advocate retaliation. I am not calling for retaliation. Rumours triggered clashes between two sections of the poor. The administration and political parties together should take the initiative for peace.

 He added that it is not the Haldia Development Authoritys job to issue land acquisition notices.

 If Bose played peacemaker, Konar said: We took up weapons in Keshpur to resist Trinamuls attacks. It will happen here too if Trinamul continues its terror.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, July 9: The districts reeled under power cuts today as generation by the Kolaghat thermal power plant dropped sharply because rain had left its coal stock damp. 

 The State Electricity Distribution Company said the shortfall in its areas around 8 tonight was a staggering 600mw. 

 Kolaghat generated 500mw instead of the usual 950mw.

 There were power cuts in several parts of Calcutta and its neighbourhood as CESC areas suffered a shortfall of 115mw. Blackouts are likely to continue as two 210mw units of Kolaghat have been closed down because of wet coal and a 500mw Farakka unit has been shut down for maintenance. 

 Calcutta: Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim asked the law minister on Monday to declare the status of the proposed high court circuit bench in Jalpaiguri. The infrastructure and the judges quarters have been set up for the bench. The government should not delay the process of making it operational, the Speaker said.

 Calcutta: Madina Bibi, an RSP leader, was shot dead in her house in Basanti, South 24-Parganas, early on Monday. Local party leaders accused the CPM of plotting the murder. Two CPM members have been arrested.

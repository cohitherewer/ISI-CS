 Calcutta, April 17: The government today pledged help to the railways in evicting unlicensed hawkers. 

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said tonight the high courts order would be carried out in toto. Well ask the Government Railway Police to take all necessary action after getting a copy of it. 

 The court today asked Eastern Railway to remove all unauthorised hawkers and beggars from railway platforms with immediate effect.

 According to the CPMs labour arm, Citu, there are over 50,000 unlicensed hawkers across Bengal, of which nearly a third are in Howrah and Sealdah stations. 

 A union leader said the order would affect over two lakh people, who depend on the hawkers income.

 Well implement the order as soon as we receive a copy of it. Well need the state governments help, an Eastern Railway official said.

 The railways advocate, Uttam Majumdar, said the order will ensure exclusive rights to the licensed hawkers. 

 The railways call tenders for setting up shops on platforms. But no licence is issued to hawkers selling eatables and other wares from coffee and nail clippers to shirt pieces in train compartments, a senior railway official said. 

 Officials admitted that there are a number of unauthorised eateries in suburban stations, in violation of the Railways Act. 

 We regularly test food sold from licensed stalls. But we cannot test the food sold by unauthorised vendors for two reasons: one, they are mostly backed by local political heavyweights and, two, we have no legal authority to do so. The passengers will benefit if we are able to implement the court order, an Eastern Railway official said. 

 Trade unions controlling the hawkers slammed the order. 

 Nepaldeb Bhattacharya of the Citu-led Paschim Banga Railway Hawkers Union described it as unfortunate, undesirable and inhuman.

 How will vendors digest such a decision? Their families are being pushed to starvation? It comes at a time when railway minister Lalu Prasad is thinking of issuing more licences to hawkers, Bhattacharya said. 

 Trinamul Congress leader Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay said Mamata Banerjee is concerned about the hawkers plight.

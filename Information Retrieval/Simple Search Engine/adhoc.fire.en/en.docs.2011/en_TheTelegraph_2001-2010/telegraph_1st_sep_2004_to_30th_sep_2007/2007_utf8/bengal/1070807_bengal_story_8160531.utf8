 Fatal twist to FM radio

 Asansol, Aug. 6: Students tune in when the teacher turns to the blackboard. So engrossed are drivers that they fail to see people on the road. And housewives forget they have put the milk on the burner.

 In fact, such is the craze for FM radio in Asansol that the letters could easily stand for fatal music.

 Two students have been killed in FM-related mishaps in the town, 240km from Calcutta, since the Mumbai-based Adlabs Films started the trial run last month. The formal launch in the Asansol-Durgapur-Ranigunj belt, the second in south Bengal after Calcutta, will be on August 15.

 Two lives have already been lost in road mishaps where FM radio was involved. So we have launched a drive against listening to FM while driving. We have also decided to warn pedestrians listening to FM radio while crossing roads, said additional superintendent of police Bastav Baidya.

 Police sources said over 200 drivers were caught and their licence seized.

 On July 25, 10-year-old Pradip Mahato was run over by a tractor while he was cycling to school. The driver of the tractor was listening to FM radio.

 Five days later, Uttam Majhi was returning home on his two-wheeler when a mini bus knocked him down. With his FM earphones on, the Class XII student, who was trying to overtake a bus, didnt notice the other vehicle.

 Now, many schools have decided to check bags of students for radio sets. Last month, some students arrived with FM radios and tuned in when classes were in progress, said a headmaster.

 If needed, we will check students bags regularly, said Francis Gomes, the principal of an English medium school.

 But such is the craze that people are queuing up to buy FM sets, which have taken the town by storm with songs from Partner, Apna Sapna Money Money and other blockbusters.

 The other day I put a pot of milk on the oven and forgot about it, said housewife Aparna Chatterjee, 32. I rushed to the kitchen only after I smelt something burning.

 An Adlabs executive said the company would like to provide the best entertainment to listeners but not at the cost of lives.

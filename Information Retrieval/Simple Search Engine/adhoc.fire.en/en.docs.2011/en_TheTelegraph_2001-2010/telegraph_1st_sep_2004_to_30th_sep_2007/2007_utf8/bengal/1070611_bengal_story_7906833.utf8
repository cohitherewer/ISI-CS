 Nandigram, June 10: A leader of the CPM womens wing, on her way back from the bazaar with a little rice and some vegetables hours after returning home, was beaten up in Simulkundu last evening.

 Geeta Baruis neighbour Nakul Barui suffered for being with her.

 Sudhanshu Barui was attacked in Gokulnagar because he had set up the first shelter for CPM supporters on Tekhali bridge. 

 The three thrashings and a hail of bombs scared at least nine other CPM supporters away from the two villages where they returned after days in exile.

 Geeta, Nakul and Sudhanshu have been admitted to a health centre in Khejuri with fractured limbs and smashed heads. 

 We crossed the Talpatti canal and fled to Khejuri, Geeta said.

 Bombs were burst outside the house of Ashish Giri, 40, and his roof was pelted with stones. His wife fled with her daughters to an abandoned cinema, where she has been hiding every night for 36 days.

 Ashish was among those escorted home to Dakshin Pally, Simulkundu by police yesterday.

 But he couldnt spend the night at home. He was hiding in the field behind his hut. Around 150 Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee supporters assembled at the Chandi temple last evening. Around 9.30 pm, they started hurling bombs. Brickbats kept hitting our roof. I spent the night in the field behind my hut. My wife took the girls away, Ashish said standing outside his hut this morning.

 The member of the CPM farmers wing has held his nerve to stay back in the village, as has his brother Atish. 

 A bakery hawker in Kakdwip, South 24-Parganas, Atish came home on holiday 25 days ago. He was forced to run away to a refugee camp in three days.

 Last nights bombing continued till 2 am, Atish said. 

 The Giris houses were looted on May 4. I fled to the Sherkhanchowk camp after that. I used to come home around 4 am to see my family. I dont want to do that anymore, Ashish said. 

 Fourteen families had come back to Gokulnagar and Simulkundu. Four returned to Ranichak, which was peaceful till tonight.

 Haldia additional superintendent Debasish Boral said three CPM supporters have lodged complaints with the Tekhali Bazar police station, alleging that they were driven out of Gokulnagar.

 Trinamul leader Abu Taher, however, denied any attack or intimidation by the Pratirodh Committee. If they dont trust their neighbours and leave by themselves, theres nothing we can do, he said.

 Around 70 families were supposed to return home yesterday, CPM supporter Bidhan Das said. But only 18 could because the committee wouldnt allow the police to accompany them and they were too scared to go home alone.

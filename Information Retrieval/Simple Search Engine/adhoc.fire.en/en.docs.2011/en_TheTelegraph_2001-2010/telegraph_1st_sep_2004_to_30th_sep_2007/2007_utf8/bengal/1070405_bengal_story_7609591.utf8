 CPM caution

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 4: Once bitten, the CPM wants to be doubly careful about land acquisition anywhere in the state.

 The chief minister has said the chemical hub would come up around Haldia and not in Nandigram, but party leaders are still advising caution.

 Weve taken some decisions in the wake of the Nandigram episode. Wherever the hub comes up, it will be with peoples consent, industries minister Nirupam Sen said at an interactive session with intellectuals at Town Hall. 

 The party brass met the East Midnapore leadership in the morning. The tone was the same there: No acquisition if the people dont want it.

 We may have made mistakes while trying to bring a change. But dont judge us on the basis of one untoward incident, said Sen.

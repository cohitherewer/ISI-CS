 Durgapur Sept. 5: Naughty 

 Sabitri has returned home after a whirlwind romance with 

 the tall, dark bloke she bolted with a week ago.

 The couple were a fair distance from each other this morning, possibly after having made love. A forest team stepped in and created a din, which drove the hunk away.

 Forest officers said the tusker had got what he wanted. 

 Sabitri, too, had had the moment of her life. She responded to her mahout today after giving him the cold shoulder for days.

 She was alone near a pond in the Gangajalghati (in Bankura) forest when we saw her. Our hulla party cordoned her off and blew conch shells and beat drums, said divisional forest officer Raju Das. Her mate was no longer mad about her as he earlier was. He walked into the forest.

 Back with her mahout 

 at the circus

 Mahout Kalimuddin Sheikh called out tentatively, but Sabitri responded readily to her acquaintance from the days of innocence.

 The truck that had been kept ready nearby, though, was not to the liking of 20-year-old Sabitri. She trumpeted aloud once, but then agreed to climb up the wooden planks.

 She made no attempt to break free, Das said.

 Not used to life in the wild, she had looked tired to Kalimuddin in a forest in nearby Mejia yesterday.

 Over 250 people had assembled at the Olympic Circus tent in Ranigunj town in Burdwan when the truck arrived with Sabitri at 5pm. 

 She was given bananas to eat and smeared with vermilion on the forehead.

 We had lost hope when Sabitri repeatedly refused to respond to our call, said Chandranath Banerjee, the circus manager. 

 He hopes to cash in now. She should ensure a full house over the next few days. Shed be our star, he said.

 The circus will plead with the Asansol subdivisional officer to let them stay on in Ranigunj for a longer period.

 The wild elephant and Sabitri had been romping around in the forests of Mejia, Borjora and Gangajalghati in Bankura since Friday. 

 Ten bull elephants and a horde of circus and forest officials had been following her spoor, though for different reasons.

 Das said forest guards were still keeping an eye on the tusker. The hulla party will follow his activities for a couple of days as he might try to make out with Sabitri again.

 The circus manager said the elephant enclosure would be fenced off with tin sheets and armed guards would be hired. We have three more females.

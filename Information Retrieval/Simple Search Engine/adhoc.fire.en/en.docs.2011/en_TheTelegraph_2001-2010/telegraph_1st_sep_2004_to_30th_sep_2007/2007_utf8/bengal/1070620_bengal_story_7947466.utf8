 Mamata seeks Centres help

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta,

 June 19: Mamata Banerjee today accused Jyoti Basu of doublespeak on restoring peace in Nandigram and said it was now the Centres duty to force the state government to bring back normality. 

 Mamata (in picture) said when she had met the former chief minister at his home, he admitted that CPM activists had been hurling bombs and firing shots from Khejuri, which must be stopped. 

 Now he is saying the administration will have to take steps if the Opposition continues to create trouble in Nandigram. This is sheer doublespeak. He is toeing the party line now, the Trinamul Congress chief said.

 Mamata wondered how Delhi could remain a mere onlooker when bullets were flying in Nandigram. 

 The UPA government should immediately force the state government to ensure peace. My party has made this plea in writing to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister Shivraj Patil. The Union government is like a parent, while the states are its children, she said.

 According to Trinamul sources, leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee has also sought the intervention of governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi. The governor said he has forwarded Chatterjees letter to the state government, an MLA said.

 Trinamul MP Dinesh Trivedi met President APJ Abdul Kalam today. Dineshda has been told to give a vivid account of the Nandigram situation, Mamata said.

 Lashing out at the CPM, Mamata said the situation in Nandigram had worsened because of the partys bid to browbeat the Opposition. 

 Everyday, one CPM leader or the other is making provocative statements against us and issuing threats. That is precipitating trouble in Nandigram. If there is a repeat of the March 14 genocide, the state government will be held responsible. We tried our best to ensure peace but the ruling party didnt cooperate, she added.

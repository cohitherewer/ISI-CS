 Raiganj, Jan. 14: After Singur and Nandigram, the farmers of Itahar bristled at the sight of an army of people descending on their land with measuring tapes today.

 This team, however, didnt want to set up a factory but to roll armoured tanks and military trucks onto their land, where a golden paddy crop will be swaying in the breeze then.

 The 20th Mountain Division of the Indian Army wants 1,200 bighas (400 acres) to conduct a month-long military exercise from the third week of February. That is around the time when the boro crop is harvested.

 Without any political partys umbrella over their heads, about 5,000 residents of three mouzas of Itahar block Bariolghat, Garahar and Bishahar marched to the subdivision office today to protest against the armys takeover bid.

 There is nothing political about our agitation. All parties have united so that our land is not taken away, even temporarily, said Raj Mohammed Sarkar, a CPM leader.

 Farmers fear that the multi-crop land about 450 km from Calcutta could be rendered useless for years if heavy military vehicles criss-cross it over and over again. 

 Moreover, there has been no talk about compensation for the damage, said Ishraful Haq, the Congress panchayat chief of Bariolghat.

 On December 18, the headquarters of the 20th Mountain Division stationed at Binnaguri had written to district magistrate Pradip Kumar Sengupta, saying the unit would like to acquire land in Raiganj to conduct an exercise of its armoured division. 

 The North Dinajpur administration has not responded to the letter yet, apparently not realising that the army is in a hurry.

 Haq said army officers visited Bariolghat on December 22. They asked me to hand over the land. Some of their men were measuring the area. I was taken by surprise. 

 The panchayat chief told the army officers that he could not issue an order as the land did not belong to him and he did not have any such instruction from the block development officer. 

 Subdivisional officer Dibendu Das said the army should not have come today without a warning. I have asked its officers to see me at my office on January 19. 

 Supradip Roy, an advocate with Calcutta High Court, said that under the Army Act, the civil administration was bound to hand over land during times of war. But in peacetime, it is up to the district officials to decide on the site. 

 Major General Sawant, the chief of 33 Corps, of which the 20th Mountain Division is a part, said tonight: We will ensure that no crops are damaged during the exercise. If some damage is caused by default, those affected will be adequately compensated. The 20th Mountain Division is already in touch with the district magistrate.

 Uttarpara (Hooghly), April 26: Spare parts ordered by Tata Motors and finished Ambassador cars were taken out of the Hindustan Motors factory today amid massive police deployment.

 The police had to resort to lathicharge twice when workers belonging to the striking Sangrami Shramik Karmachari Union (SSKU) tried to stop trucks and trailers carrying the consignments from leaving the factory. The management declared suspension of work at the unit on April 11.

 The high court had appointed two special officers to find out the volume of components ordered and make arrangements for their delivery.

 We took out the Tata Motors components and 60 Ambassador cars on 15 trailers, said Moloy Chaudhury, Hindustan Motors executive vice-president.

 A police contingent armed with water cannons, rubber bullets and tear gas was deputed at the factory last night.

 SSKU secretary Abhas Munshi said 10 workers were injured in the lathicharge.

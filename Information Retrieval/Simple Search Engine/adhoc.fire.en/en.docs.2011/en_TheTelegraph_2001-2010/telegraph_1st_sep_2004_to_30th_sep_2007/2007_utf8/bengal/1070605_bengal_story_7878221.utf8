The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 I want to meet you. Possible?

 OUR BUREAU

 5.30 pm: Basu calls Mamata. I cant move much because of my health but I want to meet you. Is that possible?

 Mamata: You are my senior, I have no problem coming over to your place.

 Basu: Can we meet at 7?

 Mamata: Why not? It will take only 30 minutes. But I dont have a car now. Ill reach your place by 7.

 6.45 pm: Mamata reaches Indira Bhavan in councillor Sovan Chatterjees car.

 Housing minister Gautam Deb and Basus confidential assistant Joykrishna Ghosh are also there

 Basu: Im happy that you responded to my call. I believe we both want peace in Nandigram and Singur. But tell me whats the situation there.

 Mamata: Thanks for calling me. Let me tell you that people who didnt want to give land in Singur have been forcibly evicted. Many of their family members have died or committed suicide. Im not opposed to industrialisation but there is alternative land in Singur. Land taken by force should be returned.

 Basu: In that case, well have to talk to the government and the Tatas. It has to be seen whether the Tatas can reorganise land in Singur. However, I dont know whether Tatas will stay in Bengal after all this.

 Gautam: If Jyotibabu says hell look into it, you can always be hopeful.

 Mamata: Sir, nearly 600 acres are unfit for cultivation opposite the Tata site. Why cant the government use that? 

 Basu: I can find out whether thats feasible. But I dont think you are against industrialisation. I had been an Opposition leader but co-operated with Bidhan Roy and Prafulla Sen on industrialisation.

 Mamata: Jyotibabu, am I so nave to think that Bengal doesnt need industry? We have questioned the process.

 Basu: Ok, well talk to Ashok Ghosh, Biman and those in the government.

 What to do in Nandigram?

 Mamata: The people want peace, but bombings from (CPM-dominated) Khejuri have to stop. 

 Basu: I know our men have been creating trouble I mean the local party. But nearly 2,000 of our supporters are staying in camps and they should be allowed a safe return. Our government will initiate action. But try to ask your supporters to help restore peace

 Mamata: Im always willing to co-operate with the government. But there was genocide and mass rape. Please look into these.

 Basu: Ill turn 94 on July 8. I want a solution in Nandigram and Singur before that.

 Mamata: Please take care of your health. Take medicines regularly.

 Tea is served. Mamata holds Basus hands and wishes him well 

 7.40 pm: Basu and Mamata emerge from the meeting for a joint news conference

 Sunshade agony and grass job for student 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Alipurduar, July 23: A first-year polytechnic student was allegedly made to hang from the sunshade of a window, fetch grass from a field and stand on one leg by his seniors.

 Kallol Saha, who came to study electronics at the government-run Falakata Polytechnic College all the way from Kharagpur, is now in hospital.

 S. Sarkar, a doctor at Falakata hospital, about 40km from here, said 19-year-old Kallol was suffering from acute breathing problems because of an injury to his chest. He had to be shifted to a Siliguri hospital in the evening. 

 The reference card from Falakata said Kallols condition was probably the result of an assault. 

 Kallol said he had gone to Subhaspally, where four seniors stay in a rented house, for some study materials and laboratory equipment last evening. They told me to hang from the sunshade the moment I entered the room. I did so until my hands could not bear the weight any longer. 

 Then they asked him to fetch grass from the football fie- ld. It was around 10.30pm then. 

 Kallol did not try to flee when he went out because he thought it was the last leg of the torture. 

 He was asked to strip when he came back with a handful of grass. They slapped and kicked me when I refused to take off my clothes, Kallol said.

 He was made to hang from the shade again and then stand on one leg.

 The college does not have a hostel. It was past midnight when Kallol returned to his rented room in a neighbouring locality. Alarmed by his cond-ition, landlord Satya Nandi took him to the block hospital this morning. Nandi also called up the college.

 The college claimed that an FIR had been filed, but the Falakata police station denied receiving a formal complaint. They told us that a student had been assaulted and that this was for our information. This is not the way to file a complaint. How can we start an investigation on the basis of this? an officer asked.

 The Supreme Court has made it incumbent on educational institutions to file an FIR if an incident of harassment is brought to their notice. 

 I sent some teachers to Kallol as soon as I heard about the incident. Well definitely see to it that the culprits are punished, principal Satyobroto Bose had said earlier. 

 Bose could not be contacted after the police denial as his phone was switched off.

 Damages for labour death in hospital

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Calcutta, May 8: The health department has been told to pay a compensation of Rs 50,000 to a woman who delivered a stillborn child allegedly because of the negligence of the doctor and staff at a state-run hospital.

 The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has pulled up the employees of the Maharaja Jitendra Narayan Hospital in Cooch Behar on a complaint filed by Iti De Sarkar. Doctor Snehasis Gupta has been asked to pay Rs 5,000 individually.

 In December 2002, De Sarkar was admitted to the hospital and got a paying bed. 

 Gupta examined her and prescribed an injection. Soon after, she got severe labour pain and requested the nurse on duty to take her to the labour room and call Gupta. 

 Although she was taken to the labour room at 11 pm after her repeated requests, no doctor or nurse attended to her for the next 12 hours, the commission observed.

 When Gupta came to the hospital around 9 the next morning, he found the hands of the baby coming out. 

 Examining De Sarkar, the doctor found that the child was dead. A surgery was performed and the stillborn child was delivered.

 De Sarkar, who had first filed a complaint with the Cooch Bihar district consumer forum, told the commission: Had the surgery taken place on time, the baby could have been saved. The injection was meant to increase labour pain, but neither the doctor nor any nurse took the minimum care to see that I received proper attention. 

 The health department, however, questioned the validity of the directive. Government organisations do not come under the Consumer Protection Act. We have to examine the validity of the order, said Sanchita Bakshi, the director of health services. 

 De Sarkar had to pay for the hospital stay, though.

 After the district forum asked the hospital and Gupta to pay Rs 50,000, the doctor appealed to the state body. It held the hospital guilty of a graver offence than the doctor, who had asked the nurses to send him and SOS.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Trinamul seeks Tata clarification

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 2: Trinamul Congress MLAs will visit Singur in turns from tomorrow and hold meetings there to protest against forcible acquisition of farmland for the Tata project and the governments move to extend prohibitory orders there.

 A meeting of the Trinamul legislature party today criticised Ratan Tata, demanding that he name those allegedly fuelling the agitation against the Singur project. 

 Ratan Tata should either name the competitors who, according to him, are provoking us to agitate in Singur or offer an unconditional apology within seven days. There is also a demand in our party on a privilege motion against him, leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee said.

 The government has not yet been able to come up with figures to deny the charge of forcible acquisition, he added.

 MLA Saugata Roy said the party should not participate in talks with the government on Singur issue till Section 144 was withdrawn there.

 Mamata Panskura pact repeat in Haldia

 Mamata: Seeking Congress

 Calcutta, June 24: The Trinamul Congress is planning a pre-poll pact with the Congress for the Haldia municipality elections on July 22, buoyed by the success of a similar experiment in Panskura last month.

 Our poll adjustment with the Congress helped us wrest the Panskura municipality from the ruling CPM last month. This time, our target is to oust the CPM from the Haldia municipality by preventing a division in the anti-Left vote bank, said Sisir Adhikari, Trinamul MLA from Egra who is also the party president in East Midnapore.

 Preliminary talks are on for forging a ground-level understanding with the Congress and like-minded parties. 

 Adhikari, who is overseeing the civic polls, said his party would campaign against the authoritarian role of CPM MP from Tamluk and Haldia Development Authority (HDA) chairman, Lakshman Seth, in the Nandigram land war. There would have been no violence leading to 14 deaths in police firing if the HDA had not issued a circular on requisitioning land for a chemical hub, he said. 

 Adhikari, however, did not give a direct answer if Mamata had given the go-ahead for the tie-up. We have nothing to say if party workers forge a poll pact with the Congress at the local level. After all, they are the ones who bear the brunt of the CPMs misrule. 

 Mamata is believed to have told aides that she is not opposed to collaborating with the Congress to ensure a straight fight against the Left Front. 

 But we want the seat-sharing deal with the Congress to be a uniform policy across the state. Why did they (the Congress) not back our candidate in Islampur in a bypoll early this year? she asked. 

 In Panskura, the Trinamul and the Congress formed the civic board, having won eight and two seats, respectively. 

 The outcome of the Haldia polls would be a referendum against the governments industrialisation policy, Mamata said.

 Sailaja Das, the Congress president of East Midnapore, said: We are determined to frustrate the CPMs move to regain the civic board. It will be jointly controlled by us (the Congress and Trinamul).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Front land talks fail

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 8: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah have failed to convince Left Front allies about the need to relax rural land ceiling for industry and infrastructure projects like special economic zones.

 With the Forward Bloc, RSP and the CPI sticking to their opposition to any SEZ in Bengal, the government and the CPM seem to have decided to go slow on the Land Reforms Amendment Bill, 2006, that proposes to relax the land ceiling.

 No consensus could be reached on the bill today. We will hold bipartite meetings with the allies to bridge our gaps and later call a Left Front meeting, said Biman Bose, Front chairman and CPM state secretary.

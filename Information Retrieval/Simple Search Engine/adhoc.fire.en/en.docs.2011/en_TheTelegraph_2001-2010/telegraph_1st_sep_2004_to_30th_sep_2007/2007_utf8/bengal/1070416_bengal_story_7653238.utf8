 Flood saviour rapes teen

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Nabadwip, April 15: A 13-year-old girl was raped by a man in whose house she was forced to take shelter with her mother when their hut was flooded last monsoon.

 She didnt speak about the torture because she was scared and somewhat unaware of the possible consequences at the tender age until neighbours suspected that she could be pregnant. 

 Snigdha Debnath (name changed) has been carrying for seven months. 

 What the sobbing girl said in Nabadwip police station a few days ago brings to focus again the reality that India is trying to cope with despite a booming economy, malls and multiplexes that most of its children are abused and by those whom they trust.

 Her father, a weaver in Surat who comes home once in a couple of years, and her mother mentally challenged, Snigdha had not thought twice while taking refuge in her rich neighbours house when floodwaters entered her tin-roof hut last September.

 By her own admission, Biswajit Saha, the son of a rich garment trader, was extremely kind to the mother and daughter. But he dragged the teenager to a room one evening and raped her.

 He continued to be kind to them even after that: to ensure that the girl did not spill the beans.

 When the water receded, Biswajit helped them clean up the hut. He (Biswajit) ensured that we had our food daily. But at the same time, he kept telling me not to tell to any one what happened that night, Snigdha told the police.

 Biswajit has been arrested on the basis of her FIR.

 A child, she did not realise she was pregnant. Local people noticed her undergoing a physical change, said the inspector in charge of Nabadwip, Pradyut Banerjee.

 Her mentally unstable mother was of no help. Questioning her, we realised that she does not really know what pregnancy is, the inspector said.

 A neighbour in the Nabadwip locality, about 100 km from Calcutta, said Snigdha used to tell them she felt heavy and tired. 

 We took her to the Naba-dwip state general hospital a week ago. The doctor said she was pregnant. When we started questioning her, she told us about Biswajit, said Samir Debnath.

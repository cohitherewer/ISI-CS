 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 18: Seconds after being born, a baby slipped into the Dansa and died after the mothers foot got stuck in a hole in the bamboo bridge on the river. 

 Fatima Bibi, 23, was on her way to the Basirhat sub-divisional in North 24- Parganas, 80 km from Calcutta.

 She was about to get off a boat at Mistirighat when her foot got stuck. The bridge connects boats with the mainland. She fell down and seconds later, gave birth to the baby, but it slipped through the bridge and fell into the water.

 Residents of the area alleged that the district administration and the panchayat did not maintain the bridge, which the people of Basirhat use regularly. 

 The baby was fished out almost an hour later. Officials of Sandeshkhali police station said the baby had died by then.

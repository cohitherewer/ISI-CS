 Bananas strike gold

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 4: After being forced to eat three dozen bananas, rotis and rice and make several trips to the toilet, Sheikh Mohasin finally excreted the gold chain he had gulped down yesterday. 

 Mohasin had swallowed the 1.5g chain after snatching it from Kiran Bahari when he saw police running towards him at the Jackson Lane-Brabourne Road intersection.

 We took him to the hospital once more and carried out an X-ray to see how far the chain has moved. It seemed to have moved closer to the rectum. Around 5pm, the chain finally came out, said an officer of the Burrabazar police station. 

 The chain, which Mohasin was made to clean, has been packed and will be kept in the thana till it is taken to court, said another officer.

 The officers turned down Mohasins plea that he be released.

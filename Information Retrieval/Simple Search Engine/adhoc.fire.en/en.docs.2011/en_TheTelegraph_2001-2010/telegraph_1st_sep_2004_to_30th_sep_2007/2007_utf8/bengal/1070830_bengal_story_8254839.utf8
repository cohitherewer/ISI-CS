The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Partner warms to Buddha approach

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Goswami amp; Bhattacharjee: No misunderstandings now 

 Calcutta, Aug. 29: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today met PWD minister and RSP leader Kshiti Goswami to clarify his views about the proposed chemical hub in Haldia.

 Doubts about the size of the hub were created when the chief minister told cabinet colleagues at a core committee meeting last Wednesday that his government needed only 4,000 acres for the hub, for which land was available and no acquisition would be needed. 

 Actually, the mistake happened in the way I explained things to you, the chief minister was quoted as telling Goswami this morning.

 The earlier impression that the hub was being downscaled had made the CPMs allies, who had been concerned about its impact on environment among other things, happy. 

 They complained of CPM doublespeak when commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen clarified later that Bhattacharjee had made a mistake because he had too many things on his mind. 

 The hub, Sen said, will cover 25,000 acres, of which around 10,000 had to be acquired.

 When I spoke to you, I was referring only to the mother refinery proposed by the IOC. This would take around 4,000 acres and would be an extension of what Haldia Petrochemicals has done so far. The rest will come up in phases, Bhattacharjee said. We havent thought of the downstream industries yet. But when Nirupam spoke, he was talking about the entire chemical hub along with the upstream and downstream activities.

 The RSP expressed satisfaction over the chief ministers approach today.

 Both the chief minister and Nirupam Sen are right in what they said. We like the soft approach the chief minister has taken. By focusing on the refinery only, he is trying to make the project acceptable to the masses. We dont want the government to talk about major land acquisition plans right now and cause alarm, Goswami said.

 Todays exercise was part of Bhattacharjees attempt to clear the air within the Left Front before the hub comes up for discussion with the Opposition on September 3. 

 Over the weekend, the chief minister spoke to the CPIs Nandagopal Bhattacharya and the Forward Blocs Ashok Ghosh to clarify the slip.

 Although the hub is on the agenda for the all-party meeting, talks will centre on the IOC refinery, said Goswami. It is the fronts duty to come up with a decision acceptable to all quarters, he added.

 Calcutta, Aug. 21: Eight teachers were held hostage in a school by students and guardians for several hours till late this evening for wearing the salwar kameez.

 Bakhrahat Girls High School in Bishnupur, South 24-Parganas, had made news last month as well after a guardians bid to impose a teachers dress code.

 Police had to wield the baton around 8.30 tonight to disperse the almost 1,000-strong mob that had locked up the teachers. Six of the eight teachers were wearing the salwar kameez.

 The government-aided schools managing committee passed a resolution making it mandatory for all teachers to wear saris about a year ago, though the government as well as Calcutta High Court had given them the freedom to choose their dress.

 The sari stricture was not put down on paper; it was conveyed verbally to the teachers. 

 This July, one of the teachers came to school in a salwar kameez and said she had undergone a surgery and found it easier to travel in that dress.

 But headmistress Saswati Das insisted on her coming in a sari. The teachers were split on the issue with eight supporting the salwar kameez. 

 On August 10, the school managing committee decided to allow teachers to wear the salwar kameez. For the first time since that meeting, the teachers came to school in the salwar kameez today.

 The trouble started in the second period when Class VII student Shravani Dutta asked a teacher why she was wearing a salwar kameez.

 The teacher slapped Shravani as she continued to protest against her dress. Then Shravani fell ill in class and was taken to the teachers room, said her classmate Madhumati Naskar.

 The teacher said she did not slap Shravani but tried to reason with her. We called a doctor who examined Sharavani and found nothing wrong with her, she added.

 As the news spread, a large number local people and guardians gathered at the school and hurled abuses at the teachers. When the school gave over, they dragged the teachers into a room and locked it up. Some students joined in the protests. 

 The teachers often tell us to abandon studies and get married to old men so that we can remarry later. They also say that we will not be promoted if we are vocal against the salwar kameez, alleged Priya Adhikari.

 The secretary of the school, Anup Ghosh, said the trouble broke out because of the curiosity of some students who never saw a teacher in a salwar kameez. 

 Some of them tried to call for a class boycott. At this, one of the teachers slapped two students and the situation took an ugly turn, he added. 

 District police chief Praveen Kumar said seven persons have been detained for hurling stones at the force. Two policemen were injured.

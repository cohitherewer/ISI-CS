 Headache amp; hope for hill chief

 VIVEK CHHETRI 

 Triveni (Teesta), Jan. 13: Subash Ghisingh today admitted it was difficult to run the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council without elected members but added that elections were not possible till October.

 The DGHC has been functioning without an elected body since March 2004. Ghisingh (in picture below) has alone been overseeing the functioning of the council as the caretaker administrator. 

 We want elections as early as possible. It has been difficult to run the council without an elected body, he told a rally at the Teesta Tourism Festival that is being organised by the DGHC in Triveni where the Teesta and the Rangit rivers meet about 50 km from Darjeeling. 

 The GNLF leader, however, sounded satisfied with the state governments role vis--vis the inclusion of Darjeeling in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution and expressed hope that a constitutional amendment bill would be tabled in Parliament during the budget session in February. 

 If the bill is passed, we can look at elections sometime in October-November. Since we will have some work to do after the passage of the bill, elections cannot take place in March-April or during the monsoon, he said. 

 However, if the bill is delayed, it would also push back the elections, Ghisingh said. The state government, too, has requested the Centre to place the bill during the budget session but people must be patient. The new council will be different from the DGHC and there will be no interference from the multi-development agencies.

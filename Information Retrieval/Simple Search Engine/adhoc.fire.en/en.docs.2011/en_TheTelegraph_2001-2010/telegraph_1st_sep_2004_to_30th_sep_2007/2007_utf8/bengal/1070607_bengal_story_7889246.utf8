The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Acquisition on hold, govt to buy land from farmers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 6: The government has decided not to wait for the land acquisition process to resume and will rather buy land directly from farmers for a township and special economic zone to be developed by DLF in Dankuni.

 DLF has already paid us Rs 278 crore for the land. We cannot keep them waiting, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said. 

 Hence, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has decided to bypass the land acquisition process. 

 The government has to hand over around 4,800 acres to DLF in two years.

 The CMDA will buy the land along the lines of Hidco (Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation), which procured land on its own for New Town Rajarhat. 

 The land will be leased to the real estate company.

 Buying such a vast stretch, owned by thousands, could be tricky. Unlike in an acquisition, where the land price is fixed, it would involve negotiations with many more.

 A land procurement committee comprising the local MP, MLA, panchayat representatives and CMDA officials will be set up. Its job would be to ensure a smooth transaction.

 The committee members will talk to local people and build a consensus on the price. We are ready to pay more than what was paid to the Singur landlosers, the urban development minister said.

 The 4,840 acres required for the township and the SEZ cover five mouzas and parts of 12 others. 

 Bhattacharya did not rule out land acquisition for the projects altogether. Some of the land may be acquired.

 The SEZ, on the fringes of the township, got an in-principal approval from the Centre yesterday.

 The minister said the company has been pressuring the government for the land.

 The land reforms department had initiated acquisition of 156 acres in Dankuni as a test case. However, soon after issuing notices under the land acquisition act, the department slammed the brakes citing local unrest.

 Land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said he was waiting for a political consensus before resuming the acquisition process. 

 If the CMDA buys the land for DLF, well give the township an exemption under the town and country planning act, Mollah said.

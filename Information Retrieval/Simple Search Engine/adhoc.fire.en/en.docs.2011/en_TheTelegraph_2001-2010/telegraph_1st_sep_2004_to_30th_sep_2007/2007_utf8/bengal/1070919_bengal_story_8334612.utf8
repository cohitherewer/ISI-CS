 Tata jobs for Singur 17

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Singur, Sept. 18: Seventeen Singur youths got Tata Motors appointment letters today.

 Himangshu Barui was elated as he walked out of the plant site, the paper in hand.

 I never protested against the acquisition of my familys land. I had an ITI (Industrial Training Institute) diploma and I only demanded a job. I had the confidence that I will get it, said Himangshu, 32.

 All the 17 in the first batch are ITI-educated. They were selected for a six-month training at the Tata Motors plant in Jamshedpur in March. At the end of the training, they took written and practical tests and interviews. 

 A Tata official said they would be on the companys rolls and enjoy benefits like provident fund, gratuity and leave. They will be based in Jamshedpur now, taking further training and be transferred to Singur when the plant starts rolling.

 The 17 have been trained in basic fitting, welding, machine shop, computerised numerically-controlled machines, electrical work, electronics and tool and die making. 

 Himangshus elder brother Swraup said: It is a dream come true.

 Goutam Ghoshs 70-year-old father Madan Mohan did not conceal that he was apprehensive after giving away his half-an-acre land. My son had tried a lot but not got a job. I had set up a small grocery for him in the village. But, now he will not have to look back.

 Goutams uncle Dipankar Chanda bought sweets for neighbours at Gopalnagar.

 At Khasherbheri, where some villagers still pelt the plants wall with stones and play hide-and-seek with police, Aloke Polen, 30, said how happy he was that the plant was coming up so close to his house. I was waiting for this day.

 A Tata Motors spokesperson said another group of 302 Singur villagers are now undergoing at various ITIs. 

 After the training, they will undertake a test to be conducted by the Bengal governments department of technical education and training. The successful candidates will then undergo a 15-month hands-on training at Tata facilities.

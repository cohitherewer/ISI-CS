The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Scurry for seats after HS record

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 2: A record 3.3 lakh students will queue up to enter college this year and Calcutta University is pulling out all stops to create more seats and introduce new subjects.

 The university wants to ensure high scorers those who have notched up over 70 per cent are not turned away and colleges have been told to figure out ways to increase seats and introduce new subjects.

 A day after higher secondary results were declared, officials of the university with nearly 102 colleges affiliated to it started working on a proposal to grant permission to some colleges that want to offer new-age subjects such as biotechnology and genetics.

 Many of them have to deny admission to deserving students now. We want to introduce subjects in demand. Some, for example, might offer a five-year integrated course in biotechnology and genetics, said Dhrubojyoti Chattopadhyay, CUs dean of science.

 The university has set up a committee to finalise the syllabi and examine the infrastructure that the colleges have.

 The city recorded a five-year high pass percentage with over 86 per cent clearing the HS hurdle. The ISC and CBSE exams have also been high scoring. So, many colleges feel that along with subjects such as micro and molecular biology, there will be a sharp rise in demand for berths in English, history, political science, economics, statistics, physics, chemistry, botany and zoology. 

 These subjects are in demand among students of all boards. We have 1,200 seats. We are expecting over 15,000 applications for the honours courses, Asutosh College principal Debabrata Chowdhury said. 

 We have asked the university to allow us to run certain new courses like biotechnology, he added.

 The West Bengal University of Technology has increased its seats in bachelor of business administration (BBA) and bachelor of computer application (BCA) courses by nearly 1,200 this year, registrar Syed Rafiqul Islam said.

 Netaji Subhas Open University has come up with a slew of moves for the low scorers. Those who cannot get into the better colleges can try our distance education mode. They can study BA in subjects like Bengali, English, political science and history. We also offer job-oriented courses such as retail management, videography and public administration, vice-chancellor Suravi Banerjee said.

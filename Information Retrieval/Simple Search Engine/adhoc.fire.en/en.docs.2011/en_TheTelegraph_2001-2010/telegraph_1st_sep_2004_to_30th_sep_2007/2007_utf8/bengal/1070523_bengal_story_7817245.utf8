The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Siliguri, May 22: A leopard was found dead in a tea garden here. 

 Environmentalists suspect that the resi- dents of Khaprail, 7 km from Siliguri, may have poisoned the animal that had allegedly been tar-geting their livestock of late. Forest officials did not rule out foul play. The post-mortem report is expected in a week.

 Krishnagar: A ticket checker was pinned down on a train on Tuesday and thrashed bec- ause he insisted on slapping a fine on a group of jobless youths. Amal Biswas, 50, has been hospitalised. One of the five was caught while fleeing the Gede-bound train near Ranaghat. Ironically, Liton Sarkar, an NGO worker, had a ticket. Police said he was standing by his jobless friends.

 Calcutta: Irrigation minister Subhas Naskar has invited the media to name corrupt officials in his department. They would be punished within 48 hours, he said.

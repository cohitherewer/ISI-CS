The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 State blamed for airport delay

 OUR BUREAU

 Malda/Balurghat, May 27: Civil aviation minister Praful Patel has accused the Bengal government of not responding to requests for land and infrastructure to get the Malda aerodrome running again.

 In response to a query by information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Patel said 400 acres of additional land would be required to restart commercial flights from Malda. 

 A team of Airports Authority of India officers was deputed to examine the present status of the airport infrastructure. The team has reported that development works at Malda airport require 400 acres of additional land, removal/diversion of obstacles. The response of the state government is still awaited, Patel wrote.

 A copy of the letter is with The Telegraph.

 State chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb declined comment, saying he has to first see what Patel has written.

 In neighbouring South Dinajpur, the airports authority has started building a wall around the aerodrome there. It is investing Rs 3.5 crore to fence off the 161-acre plot in Balurghat. The last plane from this small town took off in 1989.

 MP Abani Roy, who has been lobbying Delhi to reintroduce Balurghat flights, said some low-cost airlines have shown interest.

 HM bosses miss talks for manager

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 13: A meeting to resolve the Hindustan Motors impasse could not be held today as the management representatives did not turn up.

 Labour minister Mrinal Banerjee said they were busy attending to Debashish Mukhopadhyay, a manager who was beaten up by the striking workers on Tuesday.

 With multiple brain injuries, Mukhopadhyay, 52, was put on a respirator at the Calcutta Medical Research Institute, where doctors described his condition as serious. 

 The minister met representatives of the five striking unions at Writers Buildings this afternoon. Banerjee later briefed Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee about the meeting that lasted two-and-a-half hours. 

 The chief minister asked Banerjee to convene the tripartite meeting tomorrow.

 Banerjee said he has requested the Uttarpara plant head, Moloy Choudhury, to be present tomorrow. 

 The unions told Banerjee they would cooperate with the management only if it withdrew the suspension on at least 10 of the 15 workers charged with assaulting managers.

 I requested Choudhury to consider it. Im hopeful that the stalemate will be resolved tomorrow, Banerjee said. 

 The management made it clear today that law and order around the factory must improve before talks. The unions demands can then be taken up in phases, said a spokesman.

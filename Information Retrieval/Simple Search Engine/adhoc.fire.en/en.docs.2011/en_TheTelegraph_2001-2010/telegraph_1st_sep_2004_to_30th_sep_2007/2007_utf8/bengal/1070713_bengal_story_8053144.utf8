 Bail blow to Suhrid

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandernagore, July 12: Suhrid Duttas bail petition was rejected today and he was remanded in judicial custody till July 26.

 A large police force stood guard in the court compound to keep nearly 5,000 CPM and Trinamul Congress demonstrators under control as the Chandernagore additional chief judicial magistrate delivered the ruling.

 Contesting Suhrids bail plea, the CBIs lawyer, Partha Tapaswai, argued that the Singur CPM leader was the main culprit in the Tapasi Malik murder and there was prima facie evidence of this. 

 According to Tapaswai, Suhrids lawyer had petitioned the court to transfer the case from the CBI to some other investigating agency. But, we pointed out that it was the government which had asked us to handle the case. So the ACJM rejected the plea. We also demanded judicial custody, which we got, he said.

 Suhrids counsel Arindam Bhattacharya, however, said he had asked for the investigating officer (IO) to be changed as he had arrested the CPM leader merely on the basis of suspicion. 

 Bhattacharya alleged that Suhrid had been physically and mentally tortured by the CBI in custody.

 We are bringing direct charges against the IO, Partha Sarathi Bose (a CBI deputy superintendent). He arrested Suhrid Dutta with an ulterior motive. In the name of a polygraph test, Suhridbabu was subjected to psychological third degree, he said.

 Bose denied the charge and said Suhrid had undergone seven medical check-ups.

 The CPM leader told reporters that the CBI had tried to create mental pressure on him but its officers did not misbehave. They never treated me badly. However, there is a conspiracy against me, he said.

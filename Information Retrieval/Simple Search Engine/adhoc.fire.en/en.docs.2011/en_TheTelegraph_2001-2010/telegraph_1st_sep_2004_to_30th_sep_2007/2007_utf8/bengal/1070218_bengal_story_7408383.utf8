 Calcutta, Feb. 17: Neekar Yadav, the domestic help who st-rangled Ravinder Kaur Luthra in her Ballygunge flat on Thursday, had secretly married a Bengali woman about a month and a half ago and had been demanding a raise since.

 Sleuths said his new wifes aspirations could have spurred Neekar (Nikku to the Luthras) to commit the crime. 

 She is 24-year-old Nikkus second wife. The first lives in his village Katra, in Banka district of Bihar, where he got married a year ago. The existence of the second wife came to light during interrogation. 

 This woman, too, works as a domestic help at a south Calcutta highrise. Well question her for a peek into Nik- kus mind, said a senior detective department officer. 

 The former help of a family at Tripura Enclave, the building in which the Luthras live, the woman is believed to have met Nikku only three-four months ago. 

 By the time they tied the knot illegally the woman had left the job and started working in another apartment.

 Nikku had been feeling the pinch since the marriage. 

 He picked Thursday morning because Ravinders husband Ashit, the owner of a security and logistics agency, was away on work. Their elder son Kabir lives in Bangalore and the younger, Angad, in the UK.

 Nikku came down from the servants quarters, killed Ravinder after a tussle and set a dinner table to give the impression that she was killed by someone known to her. The plan didnt work.

 He staged an accident and got himself hospitalised but the tell-tale scratch marks gave away the truth.

 The money about Rs 3.5 lakh and Rs 12 lakh worth of jewellery he stole was found at one of his friends place.

 Nikku hails from the same district that was home to the assassin of Tara Chand and Sarda Banka, the elderly couple killed by their help in their Camac Street flat. 

 Given the composure that Nikku showed, its important to know his exact provocation and if someone else played a key role, said Gyanwant Singh, the detective chief.

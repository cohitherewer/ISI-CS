The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Jan. 23: Monish Roy, an MCom student of Calcutta University, apparently committed suicide at his Garden Reach Road home last night.

 The 22-year-old, whose parents were out of station, hanged himself from a fan. Neighbours saw him hanging through a window and called police. 

 Malda: Four lakh earthworms from here will travel 500 km to the Sunderbans. The authorities there have decided to raise earthworms because they improve water retention and nutrient absorption in saline soil. 

 Durgapur: Police in Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore will get sophisticated weapons to fight Maoists, police chief A.B.Vohra said here.

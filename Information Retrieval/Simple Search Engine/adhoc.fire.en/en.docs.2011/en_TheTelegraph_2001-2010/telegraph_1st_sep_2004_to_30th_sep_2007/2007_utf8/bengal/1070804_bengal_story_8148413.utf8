The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Land job promise broken

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 3: The turmoil over land acquisition and farmers compensation does not appear to have affected Bengals callous officials.

 The high court today began proceedings for criminal contempt against West Bengal Power Development Corporation managing director S. Mahapatra and Birbhum district magistrate Tapan Kumar Som for flouting an earlier order asking them to provide jobs to 53 people who had lost their land to the Bakreswar thermal power station. 

 Justice Asim Banerjee asked Mahapatra and Som to appear before Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar on September 3 and explain why they should not be punished.

 They could be jailed for up to two years if held guilty.

 Som and Mahapatra did not bother to obey the order of the high court asking them to provide the petitioners jobs as unskilled labourers at the thermal power station, Justice Banerjee said. 

 The duo declined comment, saying they had not received any communication from the court.

 The petitioners moved court in 2004, alleging that the power corporation had failed to keep its promise to provide them with jobs. On March 27, 2005, Justice Banerjee asked the Birbhum DM to take steps so that the labour department would recommend the names of the petitioners to the company for recruitment.

 The order also said no one else could be recruited for unskilled labourer jobs till the petitioners were taken in at the plant, 245km from Calcutta.

 Burdwan, June 20: A family of four today sat on a hunger strike in front of the Burdwan district magistrates office, demanding help for reopening their factory. 

 For two years, Anathbandhu Hazra Chowdhury has been helplessly staring at the lock on his factory in Satgachhia, about 95 km from Calcutta.

 Thanks to Citu supporters, there hasnt been any work in the unit, which used to repair transformers of the state electricity board, since May 4, 2005.

 On that day, seven workers, who had registered with Citu and formed a union, demanded that they be given appointment letters from the day work began in the factory in 1991. But Anathbandhu said the letters would be given from January 15, 2005, the day the unit started work after a revamp.

 Since then, slogan-shouting Citu activists have been preventing Anathbandhu from entering his factory. He has been running from pillar to post seeking justice, but to no avail. The Telegraph had reported his plight in November 2005.

 Today, Anathbandhu, wife Rikta, daughter Pinky, 12, and son Rudra, 4, went on a hunger strike outside district magistrate Manish Jains office. 

 If I dont get a response from the administration, I will go on a fast-unto-death with my family from next week, he said.

 Since 2005, I have written numerous letters to the chief minister, industry minister, the governor and several officials of the administration. I also wrote to the human rights commission and district CPM leaders. But there was no response. There is no other alternative for me but to resort to such an agitation, Anathbandhu said.

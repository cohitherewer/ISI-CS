The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Japan to fund farmer loans

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 31: The government is set to launch a project under which loans will be given to bargadars (sharecroppers) to buy the land they till.

 The move comes ahead of the panchayat polls, when the Nandigram-scarred Left Front is desperate to consolidate its vote base across rural Bengal.

 The project is pegged at Rs 10 crore. The government will approach the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) for a grant. 

 Funded by the Japan government and run by the World Bank, the JSDF was established in June 2000 to provide direct assistance to the poorest groups in countries that are part of the World Bank Group.

 The pilot project targets an estimated 3,000 families in three blocks of Burdwan and Hooghly districts. The government will allot farmers soft loans repayable in 20 years at a differential rate of interest.

 This is an attempt to grant ownership rights to sharecroppers. We want to implement the project in areas where the peasants lobby has a strong presence. They will be instrumental in convincing farmers to buy the plot they cultivate. Once they have full rights, they will get the incentive to work harder on their land and treat it as their asset, said a senior official of the land and land reforms department.

 The norm now is to give bargadars six times the value of the annual yield of the land they till as compensation when it is sold. 

 There are about 16 lakh bargadars in the state, whose support is crucial for the panchayat polls that are round the corner. Backlash against land acquisition for industry, especially in the wake of the Nandigram deaths in police firing, seems to have prompted the government into action. 

 Another attempt earlier this year to increase the bargadars rights was scuttled when allies opposed the West Bengal Land Reforms (Amendment) Bill, 2006. In the bill, the government had proposed that the bargadars be made co-owners of half the land through an agreement with the landowner. 

 The allies saw this as a ploy to speed up land sale, which they said would lead to the bargadars eviction.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Day of peace under police blanket

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Nandigram, June 19: Heightened police vigil following yesterdays skirmish ensured there wasnt any violence in Nandigram today. 

 The day also saw the return of 16 CPM families to Ranichowk village from the Bahargunj camp in Khejuri. They had fled after Fridays attack by Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee supporters. 

 Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said at Writers Buildings in Calcutta today that attempts were on to ensure peace in Nandigram through discussions. 

 We are against police action. The district administration has been asked to initiate dialogue between both parties (the Pratirodh Committee and the CPM) to ensure the safe return of the displaced, he said.

 Ray added that both sides were harbouring outsiders and that there were intelligence reports of Maoist presence in Nandigram.

 In Nandigram, however, the return of the families was far from pleasant. 

 There is neither food nor water at home. They (Pratirodh Committee members) even smashed our earthen pots used for storing water. They took away everything from the house, even mosquito nets, said Pingala Barui.

 Ranichowks Purbapara, where Barui stays, was the worst hit. About 50 metres from her house, the Golabari camp was set on fire on Friday, forcing over 70 CPM refugees to flee.

 More than 50 houses were ransacked and around 250 villagers fled, said a resident of Ranichowk. 

 The police today stepped up vigil in the village. Were arranging foot patrol at night. This is to boost the villagers confidence , said a senior officer.

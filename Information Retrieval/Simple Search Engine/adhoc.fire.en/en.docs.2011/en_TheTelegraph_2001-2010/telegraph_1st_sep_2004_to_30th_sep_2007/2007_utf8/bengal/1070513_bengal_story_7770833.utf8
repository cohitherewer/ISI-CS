 Boy rescue from Bihar

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, May 12: A child who did not return home after an evening stroll with the domestic help on Thursday has been traced by police to Sheikhpura in Bihars Nalanda district. 

 Sujoy Yadav is fine. Our men will return with him tomorrow, said an officer of Burtolla police station in north Calcutta.

 The officer claimed that the police reached Sujoy before the abductors could make the ransom call.

 Sonu, the help, had rejoined the Yadavs days ago, after having served them for four months earlier. He returned home minus one-and-a-half-year-old Sujoy on Thursday and said the boy went missing while he was buying household stuff.

 Sonu, who has been arrested, confessed to the police that he had handed the boy to a group of domestic helps from Sheikhpura who work in the city. One of them, Raju, has been arrested.

 Sujoy was found at the house of their mate Sajjan, who was picked up during the police raid at Sheikhpura.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 All-weather ties

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Basu, Dalmiya

Calcutta, Jan. 19: Jyoti Basus public support for Subhas Chakraborty that too after the party top brass saying no to the sports minister has swivelled the spotlight back to the former chief ministers relationship with Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

 Dalmiya, former BCCI president, had bagged the controversial Bantala Leather Complex during Basus tenure as chief minister in 1997. Basus supporters, however, say that the Bantala deal is above board and has nothing to do with his relationship with Dalmiya. 

 The current controversy is a repeat of the scenario of six months ago when the last election to the presidents post in Cricket Association of Bengal saw Basu backing Dalmiya and thereby opposing chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who supported city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee.

 Basu had then also said he was opposed to Mukherjee contesting the CAB election. 

 This time though, there is a difference. As Dalmiya is not in the fray, Chakraborty is seen as the former cricket bosss nominee just as Mukherjee continues to be viewed as the chief ministers candidate.

 Bhattacharjee, however, has already publicly dissociated himself from the CAB elections this time. 

 Bhattacharjees dislike for Dalmiya is known in both party and government circles. Although the chief minister thinks that Dalmiya has harmed the interest of cricket in Bengal, the formers reservations about the Bantala project are not unknown.

 But the reasons for Basus weaknesses for Dalmiya still remain unknown and hence the speculation.

 Although Chakraborty is known to be close to Basu, that may not be the only reason for Basus support to the sports minister. Another stronger reason, goes the speculation, is the fact that Chakraborty is Dalmiyas man.

 Political circles wonder what prompts Basu and his men to rally behind Dalmiyas cause even at the risk of creating fissures within the party.

 A member of CPMs powerful Calcutta district committee tonight said Basu had known Dalmiya closely for a long time. Dalmiya, when contacted, refused to comment. 

 Though the former chief minister was not available for comment during the day, sources close to him said the veteran Marxist had backed Chakraborty even at todays state secretariat meeting.

 But the majority in the partys highest decision-making body in the state was learnt to have overruled the veteran and green-signalled Mukherjees candidature.

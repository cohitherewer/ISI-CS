The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Videocon set for flag-off

 Calcutta, June 26: Nandigram may be simmering, but up in Siliguri, a small 25-acre biotech special economic zone will soon take off. 

 On Friday, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will lay the foundation stone for the Videocon groups proposed SEZ.

 Videocon Group chairman Venugopal Dhoot said his company was in the process of acquiring the land and has sought approval from the commerce ministry for SEZ status.

 State municipal affairs and urban development minister Asoke Bhattacharya, also the chairman of the Siliguri Jalpaiguri Development Authority (SJDA), said the SEZ would come up in Phulbari, near Siliguri.

 It was housing department plot which is being handed over to the SJDA through the land reform department. The order to hand over the land to the SJDA came today. Following this, the land will be leased out to Videocon, Bhattacharya said, not forgetting to mention that the area was not farmland. 

 In East Midnapores Nandigram, the Salim groups proposed chemical hub, which would have spanned 25,000 acres, has run into land acquisition trouble with farmers refusing to give up their plots.

 Videocon has proposed four more SEZs in Bengal multi-product and IT.

 The state has cleared them and the Centre has given the in-principle nod, but these are yet to start.

 The biotech zone will be the sixth SEZ in Bengal, after Falta (multi-product), Manikanchan (gems and jewellery), Wipro (IT) and two at Bantala (IT and leather).

 Videocon will partner a Thai company, Thailand Biotech International Ltd, and Rabo Bank and work on herbs and medicinal plants grown in the Himalayas. We ourselves will occupy large part of the land for biotech, marking Videocons foray into this sector, Dhoot explained.

 Rabo Bank, which has expertise in the agro and biotechnology industry, will rope in investors who would set up units at the SEZ.

 According to the commerce ministrys guidelines, SEZs that span up to 25 acres, especially in the case of IT and biotechnology, would not need to go through the two-stage approval process.

 Bengal commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said a company could directly apply to the board of approval under the ministry of commerce once they have the land. 

 Nandigram demand

 Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee members today demanded that Nandigram be taken out of the purview of the Haldia Development Authority. They alleged that the land tax had increased after the area was taken up by the HDA. 

 Left Front chairman Biman Bose has ruled out resumption of the state-level all party meeting on Nandigram.

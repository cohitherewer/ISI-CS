 Basu steam for Buddha drive

 Jyoti Basu on Mamata Banerjee

Calcutta, Feb. 16: Jyoti Basu today iterated his support for the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments decision to impose Section 144 in Singur and acquire farmland for industry and infrastructure projects.

 The CPM patriarch said: The (high court) judge felt the government went wrong but the government felt it did the right thing in Singur. Whenever it is required, the government will clamp the prohibitory orders again.

 Party sources said Basus endorsement was significant as it came when the Left Front allies and Opposition parties are training their guns at the chief minister.

 The allies, who had demanded withdrawal of section 144 in Singur, had welcomed the courts criticism and asked the government to consider it as peoples voice. 

 The CPM politburo meeting beginning in Delhi tomorrow would take up the schism between the party and its partners CPI, Forward Bloc and RSP. 

 The allies have also put their foot down on the governments move to relax the rural land ceiling for investors. 

 The two-day politburo meeting will be followed by a series of bipartite talks with the allies on changes to the proposed bill.

 After a CPM state committee meeting today, Basu came down on Mamata Banerjee for her agitation against farmland acquisition. Her politics is all about trouble-making. Its in her nature, he said. 

 In Nandigram, Basu said, there was some misunderstanding and confusion among the people. 

 Learning from experience, we have decided to campaign for two-three months to make farmers appreciate what the government wants to do. We stand first in agriculture and now we want to be at the top of the list of industrialised states, he added. 

 On the land bill, he said: Well talk to them before moving any further.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bat virus sparks scramble

 OUR BUREAU

May 8: A day after the presence of the bat virus was confirmed in the blood samples of three people killed of a mystery fever in Nadia, the health department set up a control room and asked the district administration to send daily reports on the situation there.

 If any new case of fever is reported, the district control room should refer it to Calcu- tta immediately, director of health services Sanchita Bakshi said.

 Health officials treating those suspected to be infected by the Nipah virus have been asked to take special protection. They should wear protective dress. Special masks, gowns, caps and gloves are being provided, Bakshi said. 

 The district health authorities have also launched a drive to pinpoint the carrier of the virus at Betai village in Tehatta, about 150 km from Calcutta. The blood and urine samples of bats and pigs would be sent to the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal for tests. 

 Bats would be caught and their blood samples collected, said an official of the animal resources development department. 

 The infection, which is believed to have afflicted at least 30 people in Nadia, was initially suspected to be a new strain of dengue. But blood samples of three of the five who have died of the fever since February tested positive for Nipah at the National Institute of Virology, Pune. 

 The two others had died of encephalitis.

 First detected in 1999, the Nipah virus spreads rapidly and has a high mortality rate. 

 According to virologists, fruit bats are its natural hosts, which can infect pigs, and both can infect humans. 

 Transmission of the virus requires close contact with infected tissues or body fluids. No medicine has been found to work against Nipah. 

 Doctors in our district were not aware of Nipah and its effects. We are now passing on government guidelines to the block hospitals, said Mohan Basu, the deputy chief medical officer of health, Nadia. 

 The guidelines say Nipah can cause epidemics and stress the need to prevent human contact with the carriers. 

 We are raising awareness among villagers. People have been asked not to come in close contact with the patients and to report cases of fever immediately, Bose said. 

 Joydeb Biswas of Betai, whose 30-year-old wife Purnima has been running a temperature over the past fortnight, has not taken her to a hospital, though. He has arranged a saline drip at his home. 

 A team from Calcutta had collected her blood several days ago. I dont know the result yet, he said.

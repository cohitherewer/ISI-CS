 Calcutta, Dec. 6: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government has put on fast track an institute of information technology (IT) where students from rural Bengal would get first preference, sanctioning 15 acres for it in four days flat.

 The infotech school, to be built by the Dr Moni Bhaumik Educational Foundation a trust set up by the US-based engineer-turned-entrepreneur to help meritorious students from rural Bengal off EM Bypass would be ready by 2010.

 I want Dr Bhaumik to start the cons- truction as soon as possible as it is a great project for Bengal that came into IT business much later than other states, the chief minister said today.

 The 600,000 sq ft institute will teach 500 students at a time and provide them with hostel facilities. 

 The trust promised that its doors would always be open for talented village students. Our main objective is to find brilliant students from remote areas of Bengal and catch them young, said D.P. Barua, who will head the institute.

 The Rs 100-crore IT school will have tie-ups with three universities from the US, UK and India. 

 The screening of rural students for the graduation course will start from Class XI. The basis: school-leaving examinations. The best will then be picked for training in English language.

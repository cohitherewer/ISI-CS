 Sadhan suspended

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 8: Sadhan Pande, Trinamul Congress MLA from Burtala in north Calcutta, has been suspended for publicly supporting the Tata Motors small-car project in Singur, going against the official party line.

 Pande has been absent from the Trinamul Congresss movement on acquisition of farmland for industry in Singur.

 We have suspended Pande on the charge of anti-party activities, including his recent public statements against our policy, Partha Chatterjee, Trinamul legislator and leader of the Opposition, said today.

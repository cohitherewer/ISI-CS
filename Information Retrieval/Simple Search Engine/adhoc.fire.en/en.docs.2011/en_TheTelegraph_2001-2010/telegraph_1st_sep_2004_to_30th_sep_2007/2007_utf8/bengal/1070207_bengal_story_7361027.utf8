The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 All work and no war on battleground

 OUR BUREAU

 Singur/Midnapore, Feb. 6: Over 700 Singur villagers continued with the construction of a wall around the Tata Motors plot in peace today with the troublemakers nowhere to be seen.

 We will complete the job by March 15, industry director M.V. Rao said, standing amid women from Bajemelia, Beraberi and Khasherbheri, villages that were rocked by violence two days ago.

 About 50 youths from landloser families were called for a test at the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation camp office. 

 Rao said those who qualify would be trained by the NIIT. After the training, they will be eligible for jobs in an IT project being planned by the Tatas. We shall conduct the test for another 50 youths next week, he added. 

 Pradyut Das and his bro-ther Sanat of Khasherbheri, who had got Rs 2.96 lakh for less than half an acre, were among those working on the small-car plant site. We are happy to be working, Pradyut said, adding: We want the factory to come up.

 The Jamait Ulema-i-Hind, however, asserted that it would march to Singur tomorrow with one lakh supporters, defying prohibitory orders. 

 We shall stage a sit-in wherever police stop us, its general secretary, Siddiqullah Chowdhury, said. 

 CPM supporters at Khejuri in East Midnapore today began repairing roads dug up by Trinamul Congress activists to prevent police from entering disturbed areas.

 We cannot remain cut-off from the rest of the world. So, we have decided to repair roads on our own and not wait for the administration, said Himanshu Das, the chief of the CPM-controlled Khejuri panchayat samiti.

 Trinamul leader Sabuj Pradhan said the CPM was repairing the roads to reach Sonachura in Nandigram to attack us.

 However, it was a CPM leader who was attacked in neighbouring Haldia. Tapas Uthasini, 20, the secretary of the Brajalalchak local committee, about 120 km from Calcutta, was hit with rods and bamboo sticks. He was heading to a party procession in support of industrialisation. 

 There were reports of bombs being hurled at some places, with each party blaming the other. Around 5.30 pm, a cluster of brick kiln shanties and a truck were set ablaze.

 East Midnapore superintendent of police Asoke Dutta, however, did not know about any of the incidents. Our force could not reach the spot as the roads are yet to be repaired. We dont know what is happening, he said.

 Girl prey to school predator

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, April 27: A Class III student was allegedly abused for days on end and raped by her headmaster.

 The 11-year-old girl, whose mother died six years ago and father lives separately after a second marriage, narrated her plight to her grandmother on being pressured to explain her reluctance to go to school of late.

 Shocked and not sure about how to react, Niyati Haldar of Jiagunj in Murshidabad about 30 km from Calcutta went to local councillor Parimal Sarkar yesterday. 

 Police picked up the headmaster of Kashigunj Primary School, Samir Barat, from his office this morning. 

 Classes did not start today as guardians surrounded the school demanding the headmasters arrest. Some of them stormed into the 53-year-old Barats office demanding an explanation. They slapped and shoved him.

 A study conducted across India has shown that one in every two children boys and girls face sexual abuse. The culprits: often the people they trust.

 Murshidabad additional superintendent of police Shankar Chakraborty said: Weve charged the headmaster with rape. The girl has been sent for a medical test.

 Niyati, the girls maternal grandmom, said she stopped going to school last Saturday. 

 When I asked her why she was not going, she broke down and told me how her headmaster had been abusing her after the school gave over, said Niyati, who sells puffed rice.

 Councillor Sarkar claimed the teachers have confirmed that Barat used to stay back after classes often, saying he had official work. The teachers told me that they saw the girl sitting in his office, he added.

 The primary school council has ordered a separate inquiry into the incident. The teachers informed us about it. Stern action will be taken if the headmasters guilt is proved, said Mohsin Ali, the district inspector of schools.

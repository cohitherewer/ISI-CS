The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Rally with guns in Nandigram

 - Sound and fury in pockets of acquisition protest

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Feb. 18: A day after Trinamul Congress activists clashed with CPM supporters and burnt and looted their houses in Khejuri, they returned with arms this morning for an anti-industry rally in Nandigram.

 Police persuaded the members armed with rods, bombs and pipe guns to return to Sonachura.

 However, when the policemen went to set up a camp near Gokulnagar, about 170 km from Calcutta, pro-Trinamul villagers forced them to abandon the plan.

 After the police withdrew in the afternoon, members of the Trinamul-backed Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee marched to CPM-domina-ted Gokulnagar and hurled bombs. Several families fled to a camp set up by the party at Tekhali.

 We are trying to start a dialogue with villagers to maintain peace. The district magistrate has called an all-party meeting tomorrow, Midnapore range deputy inspector-general N. Ramesh Babu said.

 Clashes have been taking place in Nandigram since Friday night.

 Pratirodh Committee convener and Trinamul leader Sheikh Sufian said: The movement against land acquisition will continue. We would resist the CPMs attempts to create trouble.

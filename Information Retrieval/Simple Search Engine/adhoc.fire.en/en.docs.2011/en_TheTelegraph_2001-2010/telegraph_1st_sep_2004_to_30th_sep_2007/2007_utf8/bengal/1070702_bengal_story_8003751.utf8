The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Debu spills double role

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Suhrid

 Calcutta, July 1: Debu Malik had chosen the spots where Tapasi Malik was raped and burnt alive, the CBI said today.

 Debu selected the place, about 600 metres from Tapasis house, where the rapists were waiting, a CBI officer said from Delhi after interrogating Debu.

 He then showed them the pit, on the land acquired for the Tata Motors factory, that had been dug up four days before the incident to cook khichuri on nabanna (a ritual to celebrate the harvesting of crops), where the 18-year-old land-acquisition protester was set ablaze, the officer said. 

 The killers thought the pit would hide the flames. 

 The CBI has built the murder case solely on Debus statements and arrested mastermind Suhrid Dutta, the CPMs Singur zonal committee secretary.

 The officer said Debu had also supplied the diesel with which Tapasi was doused before being set on fire. 

 Debu had been assigned to oversee the men guarding the barbed wire fencing around the acquired land. So he was well aware of the pit and guided the group of men, sent by Suhrid, to it on December 18, said an officer.

 Suhrids medical examination was conducted today and doctors suggested he could face the polygraph (lie-detector) test tomorrow. We have completed all the formalities needed for a polygraph test, said a CBI officer.

 The official said Suhrid might be sent for narco-analysis if the result of his polygraph test is not satisfactory. We will also make Debu and Suhrid sit face to face during interrogation. It will help us establish links that are still missing.

 Suhrid today called up his home with the CBIs permission, apparently to inquire about his nephew facing problems in getting admission to a school. His brother Saroj Dutta said Suhrid did not talk about the interrogation.

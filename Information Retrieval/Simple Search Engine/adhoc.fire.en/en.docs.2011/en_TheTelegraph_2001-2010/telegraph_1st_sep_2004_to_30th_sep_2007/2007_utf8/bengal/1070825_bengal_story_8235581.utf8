 HIV pariahs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Aug. 24: Three HIV positive patients were allegedly denied pathological tests at North Bengal Medical College and Hospital this morning. 

 They had come for a Mantoux test, which confirms TB. Treatment is free if a government report confirms the disease, but the technician at the chest department reportedly refused to conduct the test. 

 He didnt do it because we were HIV positive, said one who came from Jalpaiguri. 

 The hospital superintendent, however, said the technician could not because of the absence of a crucial reagent.

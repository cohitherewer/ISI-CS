The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata rejects Buddha talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 10: Mamata Banerjee today ruled out talks with the government on Singur and Nandigram.

 I shall not talk to Buddhababu (chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee). How can I sit with a man who has blood on his hands? she said, reacting to the Left Front decision yesterday to let the government decide the course of action on the land unrest. 

 Asked if she would speak to industries minister Niru- pam Sen, who has prepared a note on Singur, Mamata said: I cannot talk to whoever they (CPM leaders) decide on to suit their purpose. Ill decide who I will talk to. 

 Trinamul Congress sources said Mamatas objective is to keep the fire burning till next years rural polls. This is a political necessity for her to fare well in the elections, a senior leader said.

 Jyoti Basu is the man of her choice because he is not part of the government.

 I have high regards for his personality. When I met him on Monday, his resolve to break the impasse appeared genuine, she said.

 Basu admitted excess land had been acquired for the Tata Motors project, Mamata claimed.

 But she thumbed down his proposal to set up a committee to negotiate with the govern-ment on Singur. There is no question of setting up any such committee.

 We dont believe in any second line. Mamata is our sole negotiator, said MLA Partha Chatterjee, whose name Basu had suggested for the talks.

 Mamata told party workers Trinamul would not be responsible if the wall around the Tata site was pulled down. 

 I want Buddhababu to quit, Mamata said, adding that she was also opposed to a chemical hub in Haldia.

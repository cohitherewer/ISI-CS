The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Abuse finger at cops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 21: Four days after the murder of 14-year-old Mohammad Rameez Ahmad Shah in Garden Reach, his family today accused police of harassing them instead of arresting the killers. 

 Rameez was shot dead on Wednesday night near his house at Nadial when he stood up to a gang of goons who tried to dismantle a shamiana set up for the marriage reception of two of his uncles.

 The incident created ripples in the area and Rapid Action Force personnel were deployed to ward off tension. 

 The police today held one person, taking the number of arrests in the case to two. But Rameezs uncle, Mohammad Rashid Ahmed Shah, said the real assailants are still roaming free.

 Instead of looking for the culprits, the police raided our house early this morning in order to arrest us. This is really shocking. Later, I along with some neighbours went to the Nadial police station to lodge a complaint, Shah alleged. 

 However, South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S.N. Gupta said the police had gone to Shahs house to find out the addresses of some persons named in the FIR. 

 We have no intention of harassing Shah and his family, Gupta said. Why should we arrest those who have lodged the complaints? 

 Residents alleged that some policemen have links with criminals, which is why they are delaying the arrests. 

 Had the police been pro-active, all the five accused could have been arrested soon after the murder, said an elderly person who runs a grocery in Nadial.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Reliance retail war hots up 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 20: The Forward Bloc-run agriculture marketing board today threatened a law-and-order problem if the government doesnt stop Reliance from entering Bengals farm retail market.

 The threat has come at a time the CPM-controlled food processing department has paved the way for the companys foray into the sector.

 The Bloc and other Left Front partners like the RSP and the CPI are planning to organise protests by traders through a statewide bandh in markets.

 The traders protests against Reliances entry in farm retail will trigger law-and-or-der problems. They are angry because the government is helping Reliance acquire space for its retail shops. Well ask the chief minister to restrain Reliance from making clandestine moves to open outlets without permission from the board, chairman Naren Chatterjee said.

 He said the board has refused to issue a licence Mukesh Ambanis company had sought to procure farm produce from farmers directly for its six proposed distribution centres, which would serve its retail outlets called Reliance Fresh.

 We have denied the licence since Reliance is planning to monopolise the entire chain of farm products marketing in the state, endangering the livelihood of lakhs of small traders. Now, the company is trying to make a backdoor entry by calling their distribution centres food processing units, Chatterjee said.

 The Bloc leader has sent letters to food processing minister Mohanta Chatterjee and land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah opposing the clearance given to Reliance to hold 600 acres for its six distribution centres.

 The tag of food processing units will help Reliance retain land in excess of the ceiling.

 We considered it an in- fringement of the boards authority and requested the ministers not to interfere, Bloc leader Chatterjee said and added that the board would write to municipal bodies not to issue trade licences to Reliance shops without the boards approval. 

 Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh, who supported the attack of Reliance sites as an expression of public fury, today repeated his demand for a bilateral meeting with the CPM on the issue. 

 Mohanta Chatterjee said he had acted under the instructions of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who, he said, told him to go through the Reliance proposals and take appropriate action.

 Mollah has written back, saying his office would not do anything beyond the law.

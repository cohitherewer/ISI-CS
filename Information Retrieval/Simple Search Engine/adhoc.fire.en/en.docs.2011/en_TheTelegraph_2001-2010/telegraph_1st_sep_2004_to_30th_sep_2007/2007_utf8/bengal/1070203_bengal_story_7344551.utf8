The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Fog lays death trap

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Feb. 2: Three people were killed as a Siliguri-Asansol bus lost control while negotiating craters on national highway 34 in fog and crashed into a ditch before turning turtle on a paddy field. 

 Those killed were identified as Radha Banik, 40, her 12-year-old son Debraj, and a man of around 30 who is yet to be identified. The condition of four was said to be critical.

 The bus that started from Siliguri last night entered the pockmarked stretch in Ragunathgunj, about 250 km from Calcutta, around 6. Visibility was near zero and the road almost unmotorable, said Nazrul Islam, a businessman from Nalhati in Birbhum, who was returning from Siliguri.

 Knife out after 26 years

 Diley Rai and the X-ray showing the knife 

 Darjeeling, Aug. 29: A four-inch blade of a knife, lodged inside a man since he was stabbed 26 years ago, was extracted today.

 A team of six doctors con-ducted an operation for over two hours at Planters Hospital here to relieve Diley Rai of the weapon about whose existence he knew nothing until a few days ago.

 An X-ray showed it on Monday, when Rai, a supervisor at Orange Valley Tea Estate, went to the hospital complaining of pain in the chest area. 

 The 55-year-old said a fellow villager had stabbed him 26 years ago when he tried to stop a quarrel. 

 The operation was diffi- cult as the entry point of the knife had been blocked and we had to explore the lungs. Two ribs had to be cut and the operation was dangerous as there could have been a respiratory failure or a massive haemorrhage, said Dr Debabrata Das. 

 The knife, whose butt apparently broke during the attack, had damaged the lower part of Rais right lung and doctors were amazed at how he led a normal life for years. 

 Operations like this are conducted in special cardio-thoracic units. Here, we neither have a ventilator nor facilities for a CT scan, said Dr P.D. Bhutia. 

 The team, which had doctors from various hospitals, had to use a borrowed portable X-ray monitoring machine during the surgery. Given the circumstances, we are relieved that it is finally over. In fact, the team broke into an applause the moment the knife was retrieved, Bhutia said. 

 The hospital had waived charges for the bed and tests that had to be conducted before the surgery. Local clubs and associations offered funds for the operation after The Telegraphs north Bengal edition reported his plight.

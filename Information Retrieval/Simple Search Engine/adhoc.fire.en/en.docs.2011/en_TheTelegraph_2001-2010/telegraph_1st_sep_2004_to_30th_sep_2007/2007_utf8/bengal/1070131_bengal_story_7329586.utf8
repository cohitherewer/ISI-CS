The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Defence nod to airport

 OUR BUREAU

 Hope soaring 

Siliguri, Jan. 30: The defence ministry has waved the green flag to the proposed upgrade of Bagdogra airport to international status, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said today.

 We had met the additional secretary and the director of the defence ministry over Bagdogra in Delhi a few weeks ago. The talks appear to have been fruitful. They have written to our chief secretary, saying that they would not object if Bagdogra is upgraded to an international airport, Bhattacharya told a meeting of the district council at Siliguri College today.

 The defence nod was essential as the Indian Air Force (IAF) shares infrastructure at the Bagdogra air base with the Airports Authority of India.

 To upgrade Bagdogra airport, it is essential to extend and build new runways, a lounge and other infrastructure, Bhattacharya said. 

 As we now have the defence ministrys clearance, the chief minister will write to the civil aviation ministry, which must play a major role in the whole process. 

 The air officer commanding-in-chief of the Eastern Air Command, Air Marshal Fali Homi Major, told The Telegraph: We have had discussions with the (Bengal) government. The matter (Bagdogra airports upgrade) is very much on the agenda. 

 Major will be the next chief of air staff. 

 The final approval for any plan regarding an IAF-controlled airport rests with the air force headquarters. 

 When Major moves over to the headquarters on March 31, the Bagdogra plan is likely to gain momentum.

 At the development council meeting, Bhattacharya spoke of industrialisation and urban development as two unalienable ingredients of any developing economy.

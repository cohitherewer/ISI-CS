The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bankura land dossier next week 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Sept. 9: The Bankura administration will provide details of the 3,000 acres to be acquired for the planned industrial hub next week.

 We have finished 50 per cent of the job of identifying land in seven blocks and have decided to submit a detailed report to the WBIDC (West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation) by next week. Officials of the corporation will then come to Bankura to start their job, district magistrate Surendra Gupta said today.

 The report will detail the nature of land to be acquired, the mouzas in which they fall and the number of owners in the stretch. 

 The corporation will build the hub, which will have the potential to bring in an estimated Rs 10,000 crore as investment, and develop the infrastructure with the help of the Bankura Comprehensive Area Development Authority. It will build new roads around the complex. 

 District officials said the corporation will open a camp office in Bankura next month ahead of a more detailed land survey. 

 Everything will be done on the basis of a consensus among political parties and landowners. We hope there will be no resistance, like in Singur and Nandigram, as the people of Bankura need the hub for their survival, said Amiya Patra, the local MP and chairman of the development authority.

 Construction, expected to begin early next year, could take a year or two, Patra said, adding that the enclave will house at least 500 small and medium-scale units.

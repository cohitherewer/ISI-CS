 Teacher takes IITian to court

 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN

 Behrampore, April 3: A high school teacher has moved court, accusing an IIT engineer of squeezing Rs 6 lakh out of her after promising marriage.

 Snigdha Sinha lodged the complaint in the court of the Behrampore chief judicial magistrate on Saturday.

 The English teacher said Debjyoti Burman, who works for a multinational in Bangalore, had a two-year relationship with her while he was a student of Kalyani Engineering College. 

 He took money from me on various pleas. I gave him Rs 6 lakh in all. But over the past year and a half, since he got the Bangalore job, he has snapped contact with me, Snigdha told the court.

 A resident of Phansidewa in Darjeeling district, she got the job here in 2002. Debjyoti, of Cooch Behar, is her distant relative. 

 We were introduced to each other in 2003, when he was a mechanical engineering student at Kalyani. He used to visit me in Behrampore and we fell in love. 

 He took money to buy a computer, books and even pay for his admission to the post-graduate course in IIT Madras during early 2005. At that time, I took a bank loan of Rs 3 lakh and gave the money to him. He changed his mobile number in January 2006 and cut off all connections with me, Snigdha said.

 She went to his house and came to know about his shift to Bangalore. But his family refused to give her his address. 

 I have to pay Rs 7,000 a month for the loan. I was forced to knock on the courts door, Snigdha added.

 Her lawyer Peeyush Ghosh said the chief judicial magistrate has asked Behrampore police to conduct an inquiry and submit a report. 

 Debjyoti could not be contacted. His father Dhananjoy Burman said over the phone that the allegations against his son were baseless. 

 She (Snigdha) came to me last June and claimed that she took a Rs 3-lakh loan and gave the money to my son. My son has denied having taken any money from her. Nor did he have an affair with her, said Dhananjoy said.

 If she can prove that she gave money to my son, Ill pay her Rs 3 lakh, he added.

 Behrampore police station inspector-in-charge Dilip Ganguly said an inquiry has begun.

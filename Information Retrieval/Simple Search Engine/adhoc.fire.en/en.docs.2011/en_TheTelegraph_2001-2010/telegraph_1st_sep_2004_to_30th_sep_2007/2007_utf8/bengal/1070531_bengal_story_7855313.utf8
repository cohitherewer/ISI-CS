 Bloc spanner in retail plan

 Calcutta, May 30: The Forward Bloc-run agriculture marketing board today wrote to land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah opposing the move to make room for Reliances farm produce hubs.

 Mollah had yesterday said Reliance wouldnt face problems holding land above the ceiling for its six proposed 100-acre hubs if it fits into the agro-industry bracket. 

 Having failed to obtain a licence from the board to procure farm products directly from farmers and sell it through its retail outlets, Reliance is apparently trying to get the hubs approved as food-processing units. 

 If Reliance hubs are allowed in the guise of food-processing units and land ceiling is relaxed for them, well oppose it. No ceiling exemption can be given to any company without cabinet approval, board chairman and Bloc leader Naren Chatterjee said. 

 No company can procure and trade in farm products without licence from the market committees controlled by the board, he added.

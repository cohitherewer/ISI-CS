The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Firing clean chit to cops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 22: A government report has said police had to open fire in self-defence in Nandigram on March 14 and blamed at least two deaths on injuries from sharp weapons.

 The commissioner of Burdwan division, Balbir Ram, submitted the three-volume report, which runs into 170 pages, to state home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray today. Ray later discussed it with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb. 

 The government had ordered the administrative probe on March 20 following widespread protests across the state against the police firing. 

 Officials associated with the probe said that on the morning of March 14, members of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee had started throwing bombs and brickbats at the police when the force requested them to help the administration repair the dug-up roads.

 The police initially wielded their lathis and then lobbed teargas shells to disperse the mob. Instead of retreating, the Pratirodh Committee members started firing at the police and hurling bombs. There would have been more casualties had the police not opened fire, an official said, quoting the report. 

 Of the 14 who died that day, 10 were killed in firing, but not all fell to police bullets. Two died in bomb explosions and two succumbed to injuries inflicted by sharp weapons, the official said.

 Haldia huddle

 The CPM state secretariat today summoned Haldia Development Authority chairman Lakshman Seth and other party leaders from East Midnapore district to discuss strategy for the July 22 municipal poll. 

 The party has also decided to form a team of senior state committee leaders, which will include members of the state secretariat, Citu state president Shyamal Chakraborty, rural development minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and peasant front leader Madan Ghosh, to supervise the election.

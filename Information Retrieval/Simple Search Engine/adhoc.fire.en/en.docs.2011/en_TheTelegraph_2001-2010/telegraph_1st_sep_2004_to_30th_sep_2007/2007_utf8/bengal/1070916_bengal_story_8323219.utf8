Calcutta, Sept. 15: A quick motorcycle ride to a relatives house to see the India-Pakistan thriller together with friends has snuffed out two young lives and left a third numb with shock.

 Indrajit Benjamin Bag, who remembers the skid near Shyambazar, the screech of a heavy truck very close and nothing more has miraculously escaped with minor injuries. But the crash has left a deep scar on the 18-year-old who sat for Madhyamik this year.

 Benjamins friend Ehtesham Alam, 19, was riding the vehicle. He was the one who called Benjamin and Royn Amit D. Rozario childhood friends in Taltala, where they were neighbours out for the trip to Cossipore.

 They were travelling along APC Road when Alam lost control around 10.30pm. A truck trailing them crushed Alam and Rozario.

 None of them was wearing a helmet and the bike was moving fast. We have arrested the truck driver and impounded the vehicle, said deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Gyanwant Singh.

 Benjamin said Rozario was between him and Alam. We suddenly fell and I heard their screams and the truck tyres screech. Something hit me on the head...I cant remember anything else, he mumbled.

 Let him sleep. The doctors have said he needs complete rest, said mother Purnima.

 A relative said the three went out together on Alams motorcycle frequently and always wore helmets.

 I cant believe it. It must be a nightmare, said Mohammed Esramuddin, a neighbour.

 Alams father Mukhtar said his son suddenly decided not to see the match at home. He left at 9:30pm, when the match was about to start. I saw Alam pick up Rozario and head towards Benjamins place. 

 Rozario, 20, had completed a hotel management course and was looking for a job. Alam was a first-year BCom student.

 Rozarios mother has fainted several times since hearing the news, said aunt Anjali.

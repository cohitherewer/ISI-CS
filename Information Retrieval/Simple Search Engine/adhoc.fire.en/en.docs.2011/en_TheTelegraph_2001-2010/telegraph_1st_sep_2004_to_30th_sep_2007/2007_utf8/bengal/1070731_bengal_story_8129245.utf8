The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Its different, say CPM leaders

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, July 30: The CPM took pains today to highlight the differences between Khammam and Nandigram as Mamata Banerjee harped on the parallels in the agitation for land in Andhra and Bengal.

 The CPM state committee condemned the indiscriminate and unprovoked police firing on the peaceful movement of farmers and wage-labourers on Saturday. A team from Bengal will go to Andhra to express solidarity with the agitators. 

 Stepping out of the meeting, party patriarch Jyoti Basu said: Our politburo member, Sitaram Yechury, has reported from Andhra that there was no provocation for the police firing. The farmers had only hurled a few stones. But the situation was different in Nandigram. The police were compelled to open fire, said the divisional commissioners probe.

 The communique condemning the Khammam firing had no mention of Nandigram. 

 State secretariat member Benoy Konar called the Nandigram agitation undemocratic to justify the police firing on March 14 that left 14 dead.

 It was a revolt against the state and an elected governments authority. In Andhra, we did not wage any armed struggle against the government, but launched a peoples movement asking it to fulfil its electoral promise of land reforms.

 Mamata met governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi today and demanded compensation for the families of those killed on March 14 and action against the guilty police personnel, as in Andhra. 

 If the Andhra Pradesh chief minister can take action against the guilty officers, why cant the Marxist government here do the same? she asked after the 20-minute meeting.

 Here, the land of poor farmers has been taken away in Singur and attempts are being made to do a repeat in Haldia. However, in Khammam, the party wants the Congress government to give land to the poor. Isnt this doublespeak? The CPM stands exposed, the Trinamul chief thundered.

 Mamata denied any provocation for the police firing on March 14. There was no provocation at all. Peaceful villagers had assembled in Nandigram to protest against the move to acquire land for a special economic zone, Mamata said.

 No policeman was killed, but only villagers, she added.

 Konar had no doubt about what makes a movement democratic or undemocratic.

 Reacting to the demand for compensation, he said: The families of CPM supporters and police killed by Mamatas supporters should also be paid damages in that case.

 Hundreds of CPM supporters are still homeless in Nandigram. If Trinamul refuses to let them return home, either police will use force or they would withdraw and street fights will determine the final result, Konar added. 

 A day after one person was killed and three were injured in exchange of fire and bombs between Trinamul and CPM supporters Nandigram, an uneasy calm prevailed.

 Home secretary P.R. Ray said in Calcutta: The police in Nandigram will have to play a more pro-active role.

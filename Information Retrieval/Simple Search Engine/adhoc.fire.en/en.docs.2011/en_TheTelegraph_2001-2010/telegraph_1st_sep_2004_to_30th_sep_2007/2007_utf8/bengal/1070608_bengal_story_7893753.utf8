The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata waits

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 7: Mamata Banerjee is waiting to hear from Jyoti Basu and is prepared to discuss a structured alternative to resolve the Singur impasse, if offered by the Bengal government.

 Sources said the Trinamul chief wants the compromise formula to revolve around certain issues:

 Land of unwilling farmers and those who did not accept compensation should be returned

 Let the government dispute the Trinamul Congress claim that around 400 acres were acquired forcibly. Talks can then be held on the actual figure

 Let the marshy land nearby be used for ancillary units

 The acquisition cant be termed complete as cases are pending in court

 The government should move amendments to enable return of land

 Mamata is sticking to her demand that the March 14 deaths be termed genocide.

 Singur cheque

 The government today informed the high court that owners of 671 acres acquired for the Tata Motors project in Singur had collected their compensation till April 25 while those of 326 acres were yet to take the cheques.

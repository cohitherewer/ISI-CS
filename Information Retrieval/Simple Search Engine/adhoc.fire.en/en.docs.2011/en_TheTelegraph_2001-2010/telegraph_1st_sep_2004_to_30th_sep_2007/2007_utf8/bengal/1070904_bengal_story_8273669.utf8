The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Suicide bid outside CPM hub

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 3: A Baruipur resident nearly set himself ablaze outside the CPM headquarters on Alimuddin Street this evening.

 Debabrata Chowdhury, in his late 30s, was stopped by policemen moments after he had sprinkled kerosene on his body. He was arrested and is being questioned.

 Police recovered a letter from Chowdhurys bag addressed to state CPM secretary Biman Bose and former Left Front chairman Sailen Dasgupta, who died in July 2001.

 The letter speaks of how local CPM leaders intervened in a feud between him and his in-laws and provoked his wife to lodge a complaint against him. 

 Chowdhury has written about having approached local party leaders to settle his family dispute out of court but to no avail.

 We are trying to find out whether Chowdhury has a history of mental disease. If he is found healthy, prosecution may be initiated against him on the charges of attempting suicide, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 Sukhendu Panigrahi, a state committee member of the party, said: We are not bothered about the incident. The party is not even interested in finding out whether he is a party worker. We have handed him over to the police.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Section 144

 Calcutta/Singur, Jan. 29: Prohibitory orders in Singur were lifted after Sunday midnight as section 144 cannot be in force for over 60 days at a stretch.

 Under the rules, we couldnt have extended the prohibitory orders further, home secretary P.R. Ray said. 

 The prohibition, promulgated in Singur on November 30 to prevent rallies against the Tata Motors project, was extended thrice. If the government wants, it can reimpose section 144 in Singur from Monday midnight.

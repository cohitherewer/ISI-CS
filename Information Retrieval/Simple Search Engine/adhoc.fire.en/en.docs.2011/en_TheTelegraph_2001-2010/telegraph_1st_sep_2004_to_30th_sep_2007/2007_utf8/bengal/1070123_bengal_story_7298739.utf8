 CPM meet with CAB on agenda

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 22: The CPM hopes to end the impasse over Subhas Chakrabortys interest in the CAB poll at a meeting with him at Alimuddin Street tomorrow in the chief ministers presence. 

 The meeting precedes a one-day state committee session slated for Wednesday, where observers said the sports minister could raise the issue. Wednesday is also the last date for filing nomination for CAB president.

 CPM sources said Jyoti Basu and Somnath Chatterjee, who earlier gave the go-ahead to Chakraborty, were instrumental in organising tomorrows meeting to dissuade him from stepping on to the cricket pitch. Housing minister Gautam Deb, one of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees trouble-shooters, is also on a peace mission. 

 We hope that everything will be sorted out by tomorrow and there wont be any election, said a CPM secretariat member close to Chakraborty. 

 Chakraborty kept mum today. But CPI minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya insisted that he would stick to his guns. Subhas called me yesterday and conveyed his decision to contest the poll, he said. 

 The CPI leader had earlier said Chakraborty would be a better choice for CAB president than city police chief Prasun Mukherjee.

 However, CPM MP Amitava Nandy, also close to Chakraborty, said he would not do anything against the party line.

 The party had asked Chakraborty not to contest the poll.

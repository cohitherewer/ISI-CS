The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Selfish slur drives girl to death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, March 28: A girl, who had decided to stay back with her father when her parents split as she loved him dearly, killed herself yesterday after he scolded her.

 Mallika Haldar, 12, who shouldered all household chores and cooked for her father, finished off the lunch yesterday before he returned home.

 Amar, a vegetable trader, who had hinted to Mallika in the morning that he would have to go to Calcutta and might be late, came home hungry late in the afternoon. Told that there was nothing left for him, the resident of Simurali in Nadias Chakdah, 60 km from Calcutta, snubbed his daughter and branded her selfish.

 Mallika quietly slipped into her room and drank a bottle of pesticides. Amar saw her writhing in pain around 4 pm. 

 The Class V student died at the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital in Kalyani. 

 Sanjit Mondal, the Chakdah police station inspector-in-charge, said the she could not bear being snubbed by the one she loved most. 

 Amars wife Minati left home two years ago with son Santanu, now 5 years old. She wanted to take Mallika along, but the girl refused. She had insisted on staying with me... I let her down, sobbed Amar.

 He told Mallika to go to her mother if she so wanted. She rushed to her room after that.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Food biggies in queue, land plan on menu

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, Jan. 16: The Indo-American Chamber of Commerce is set to submit a proposal for a 500-acre food park that will involve an invest-ment of Rs 2,500 crore and food processing giants such as Cargill and Kelloggs. 

 The proposal would be made public in the presence of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at a seminar on Indo-US business opportunities in agri and food processing on Friday.

 The companies, if permitted, would acquire the 500 acres themselves and fund the project entirely without government help, said S.K. Jain, the regional president of the chamber of commerce.

 In the middle of a raging debate on the governments farmland acquisition for industries, Sajjan Jindals JSW Steel, which has proposed a Rs 35,000-crore project in the state, has also agreed to buy a portion of the land directly from farmers.

 Representatives of some of the big-ticket US companies are slated to meet the chief minister on the day of the seminar. 

 We are working on the proposal, which would include companies like Carg- ill, Archer Daniel Midland, Kelloggs and Agrotech, said Jain.

 This project would be the backbone of the states food processing infrastructure, providing various common facilities to the companies. We are in the process of finalising 30 firms that would be part of the park, he added.

 The park, with food laboratories, warehouses and cold storages, should be ready in 18 months from the date of land acquisition.

 Cargill representatives had met Bengals food processing officials when the company wanted to invest in an edible oil unit earlier. The project has come up in Orissa. 

 The food processing industry in Bengal is estimated at Rs 4,500 crore with exports fetching under Rs 1,000 crore. The national target is Rs 1.4 lakh crore worth of business in five years.

 Pepsi, also a US company, has increased its demand for potatoes from Bengal from around 7,000 tonnes two-and-a-half years ago to around 50,000 tonnes this year.

 If everything goes according to plan, the proposed food park could be the first of its kind in Bengal. The Dankuni food park got mired in a land row and failed to get started and a 50-acre one at Sankrail lacks basic some facilities.

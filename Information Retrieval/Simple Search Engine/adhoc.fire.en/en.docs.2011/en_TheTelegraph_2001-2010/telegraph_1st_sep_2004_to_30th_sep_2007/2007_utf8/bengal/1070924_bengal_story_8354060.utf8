The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Questions leave MLA speechless

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Sept. 24: Mamata 

 Banerjee this evening sought a CBI probe into the death 

 of Rizwanur Rahman but the demand masked the dilemma her 

 party wrestled with through the day.

 When she reached the Rahman house, along with local Trinamul MLA Javed Khan, an exchange established that the partys fears were not entirely misplaced.

 Javed, accused of advising the couple to visit Rizwanurs father-in-law Ashok Todi, asked the family why he was not informed when Priyanka did not return from her home.

 Rizwanurs brother Rukbanur then told the MLA. Why are you asking this now? You were instrumental in persuading Priyanka to go back to her parents. Why are you coming and asking this after my brothers death?

 Javed did not reply but kept nodding his head.

 In a statement attributed to Rizwanur, the computer graphics teacher had mentioned that Javed had advised the couple to visit Todi after Priyankas aunt informed them that the businessman is in hospital. Priyanka did not return after leaving to see her parents on September 8.

 Trinamul sources said the party was in two minds on Sunday on how to approach the controversy as Javeds name also figures in the statement. Eventually, keeping in mind local sensitivities, the party decided to go on the offensive.

 The sources said Javed was not aware of the details and got involved after being requested by another Trinamul MLA who is related to Todi.

 Salim swipe

 Biman Bose may defend police but not all colleagues or partners are echoing him.

 The police have taken upon themselves a role for which they are not paid. The po-lice took unusual interest in Rizwanurs case and exceeded their brief, Mohammad Salim, the CPMs Calcutta Northeast MP, said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Buddha loves to visit US for business

 A STAFF REPORTER

 'Most welcome'

Calcutta, Jan. 19: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told a seminar organised by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce that he would love to visit the US.

 I would love to go to America and we welcome American investments, which will help speed up the rate of industrialisation in the state. I am preparing for a trip, Bhattacharjee said.

 However, the chief minister added that the transition to new technology and foreign investments had to be made while ensuring that the interests of all stakeholders are safeguarded.

 I have spoken to Wal-Mart on the one hand and companies like Reliance, Pantaloons and ITC on the other. In a bid to improve our logistics, farm produce and marketing channels, we cannot forget that there are thousands of intermediaries between the farmer and the consumer. So, we have to create the right balance between protecting their rights and improving market mechanism, the chief minister said.

 In a lighter vein, Union food processing minister Subodh Kant Sahai told Bhattacharjee: Dada, you cannot stop the Wal-Marts or the Tescos from entering the Indian market. They will take the indirect route and find partners in Bharti or the Wadias.

 Oh! They are most welcome, the chief minister replied.

 The Union minister lauded Bhattacharjees efforts in promoting the food processing industry. Bengal is the only hope in this region where things are moving, unlike Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, MP and Jharkhand, where the pace is very slow.

 Bhattacharjee said that food processing has emerged as the third-most important sector, after iron and steel and chemicals and petro chemicals, in attracting investments to the state.

 Leather complex

 After Bantala, the state will have another leather complex, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee announced today at the inauguration of the 31st edition of Lexpo, the annual leather exposition in the state.

 The complex, which will come up at Panjipara in Uttar Dinajpur, will focus on high-quality tanning, he said. The Rs 30-crore project will be a public-private partnership.

 Tiger tests point to killer train

 - Railways stick to poacher claim

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 A Royal Bengal tiger

 Alipurduar, June 19: A post-mortem of the tiger found dead next to railway tracks in Cooch Behar district yesterday has confirmed that it was hit by a train. 

 Last evening, preliminary reports had hinted at four broken ribs and a grievous liver injury. The autopsy has revealed huge blood clots in the heart and internal haemorrhage.

 The carcass was burnt last night at Jaldapara north range, 55 km from here.

 The forest department has lodged a complaint against the railways at Ghokshadanga police station and will send samples of the tigers viscera to the Wild Life Institute of India in Dehra Dun for another test. 

 We have lodged a police complaint as we are sure that the tiger was killed by a moving train, said Manindra Biswas, the divisional forest officer of Cooch Behar. 

 The post-mortem has revealed the presence of big blood clots and internal haemorrhage. This is possible only when there is a sudden impact. In this case, the only thing that comes to mind is the train. Only a machine moving at such speed can crush so many bones, he added.

 The body of the full-grown Royal Bengal tiger was first discovered by villagers of Baro Salmari, 42 km from here, around 6 am yesterday. Initial suspicion had fallen on the Sealdah-bound Kanchenjunga Express that had passed the spot half-an-hour earlier. 

 But the railways stuck to the claim that the tiger had been killed by poachers. Arjun Rakshit, the divisional railway manager of Alipurduar who visited the spot today, said: I am yet to receive a copy of the post-mortem report. But I am sure the tiger wasnt hit by a train. Our drivers would have informed us had that happened.

 He added: Besides, there were no extensive injury marks on the body. Not only that, if there was a tiger in the area, people who live there would have known, or at least some of the cattle that they domesticate would have fallen prey to it. This proves that it is the job of poachers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Singur arrest

 A STAFF REPORT

 Calcutta, June 24: The CBI today formally arrested Singur villager Debu Malik in the Tapasi Malik death case after he failed to clear the lie-detector test in Delhi. 

 Eighteen-year-old Tapasis charred body was found on the land fenced off for the Tata Motors car project on December 18 last year. She was a member of the Save Farmland Committee.

 CBI sources said Debu, a CPM activist who was in charge of the guards manning the boundary wall of the factory site, was seen on TV channels saying that Tapasi committed suicide.

 He failed to clear the polygraph test today and came up with contradictory statements, said a CBI official. 

 CPM leader Benoy Konar said Debu was not a member of the party but failed to explain why he was in charge of the night patrol manned by local CPM workers. 

 Debu will be brought back to Calcutta on Wednesday.

 Calcutta, Jan. 20: Armed with clearances from various government departments, the Book Fair organisers began their ground work on a war footing at 11 this morning.

 The high court had told us yesterday that we can start work at our own risk. Since we have the necessary permiss- ions, we have decided to take that risk. We dont have time at all. Our lawyers will file affidavits before the court on Monday and submit all the permission letters, said Sudhanshu Dey, the ground secretary of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild.

 Guild officials gave copies of all the government clearances to the chief secretary this afternoon.

 A complication had arisen yesterday due to the court order, which said we should ob- tain the clearances before starting work. We have done the needful, guild general secretary Tridib Chatterjee said at Writers Buildings this afternoon.

 Calcutta High Court had ordered suspension of work until clearances from police and related departments were obtained. 

 Before that, the guild received permission to hold the fair on the Maidan from Fort William on January 18, two days after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wrested a clearance from the ministry of defence after pulling strings in Delhi.

 Only after yesterdays court order did the organisers scramble to seek clearances from government agencies like the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), the fire services department, the police and the pollution control board.

 The guild secretary said the government clearances usually come days before the fair. 

 The PCB issues its clearance only four or five days before the fair. Fire department inspectors inspect the ready stalls and then quote their service charge. This year the stalls are not ready yet, but we had to hurry because of the court order. As for the police permission, it comes only after the army gives the go-ahead, he said.

 Guild officials hinted that court orders were delaying their work. A meeting to coordinate work for the fair was scheduled with officials of the PWD, army, Calcutta police, fire department and the CMC at 4 pm yesterday. But it had to be postponed because of the court order. The chief secretary will organise the new schedule and inform us on Monday, an official said.

 Asked if the Book Fair would spare the citys lungs next winter, Chatterjee said it was not for the guild alone to de- cide. There are many stakeholders.

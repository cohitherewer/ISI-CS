 BRIEFS

 Barasat, March 12 : Around 1,000 people, including farmers, today gheraoed the office of block development officer at Deganga, about 40 km from Calcutta, to protest against proposed land acquisition.

 Two days ago, the local panchayat officers had declared acquisition of nearly 1,400 acres of farmland in the area for developing a parallel road beside Jessore Road.

 Calcutta: Mamata Banerjee has said she is ready to face next years panchayat polls on the issue of the governments move to grab peoples land and homes for industrialisation. At a rally of the CPMs peasant wing on Sunday, chief minster Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had challenged the Opposition to accept the 2008 panchayat polls as a referendum on the governments industrial policy.

 Calcutta: The state government is set to open up some government posts hitherto reserved for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in order to accommodate candidates from the general category. The government took the decision after it was discovered that no eligible ST/SC candidates were found to fill the quota. A proposal on this score will be tabled at the cabinet meeting on Wednesday. 

 Barasat: Three persons, including a six month-old baby, died in Bongaon in North 24-Parganas, about 60 km from Calcutta, when the driver of a truck heading towards Petrapole lost control and hit the victims who were standing by the roadside.

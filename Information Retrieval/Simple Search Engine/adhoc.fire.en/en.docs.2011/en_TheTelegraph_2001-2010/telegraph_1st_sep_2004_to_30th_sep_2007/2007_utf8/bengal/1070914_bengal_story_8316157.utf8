 Youth tied

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, Sept. 13: Police today rescued a youth who was kept chained in his Nadia home by his father under pressure from some youths, allegedly backed by the CPM.

 The cops found Fatik, 26, tied to a tree when they reached his father Babar Ali Mondals house. Babar said Fatik was thrashed by the CPM supporters when he protested against the harassment of girls. They warned that he should not be seen anywhere in the area. A scared Babar tied up his son. 

 The CPM leadership has said those who threatened Babar have nothing to do with the party.

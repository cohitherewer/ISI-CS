 May 6: Parched north Bengals craving for rain turned into a death wish for three people today.

 In Malda, Irfan Ali, 16, and his nephew Babar Sheikh, 6, died when lightning struck a group of children in Englishbazar while they were searching for mangoes on the ground after a thundershower. 

 Another boy of the same group was seriously injured.

 Sixty-five-year-old Brahma Barman was struck by lightning in Barduari, North Dinajpur, during a thundershower in the afternoon. 

 The storm, which started around 3 pm and lasted 40 minutes, flattened nearly 150 huts and damaged crops in Barduari, Panishala, Maharaja and Shitgram. 

 Further north, rain lashed Cooch Behar town and surrounding areas in the evening.

 Despite the deaths, the rain brought relief to the region experiencing a severe dry spell. 

 Soaring heat had claimed two lives in the past two-three days and temperatures remained above normal across all six districts. Siliguri recorded 36.6 degrees Celsius today, the highest this year. 

 Subir Sarkar, who is in charge of the weather station at North Bengal University, said the region gets 180 mm of rain on an average in April. This year, it got only 80 mm. The scene in the first few days of May was equally grim. There was 40 mm of rain until today, against an average of 400 mm. 

 On Wednesday, farm labourers Mohammad Ibrahim and Upen Das died because of the heat at Phansidewa, around 30 km from Siliguri. They had been out in the field. 

 The dry spell left tea researchers and officials of the agriculture department worried about low yield. 

 Additional director of agriculture, north Bengal, Sarthak Burma said crops have got less than 50 per cent water.

 Fever and gastro-problems were on the rise, a doctor in Siliguri said. 

 But the temperatures brought a windfall for tour operators in the hills. Thousands are heading to Darjeeling, Gangtok and other places, said Gopal Lama, the deputy director of north Bengal tourism.

 Some 5,000 tourists are coming to the hills everyday, about 30 per cent more than the peak-season average.

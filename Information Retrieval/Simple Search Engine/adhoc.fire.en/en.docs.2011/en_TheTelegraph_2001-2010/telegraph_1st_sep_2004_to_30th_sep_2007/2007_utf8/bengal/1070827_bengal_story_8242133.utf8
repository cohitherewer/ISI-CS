 Cong seeks meet nod 

 OUR BUREAU

 Aug. 26: The state Congress will ask Sonia Gandhi whether to attend the all-party meeting on the chemical hub. 

 A section of the party said to be close to information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi is opposed to participation in the September 3 meeting.

 MP Adhir Chowdhury, former mayor Subrata Mukherjee and former MLA Abdul Mannan today said it would be doing injustice to the victims of police firing in Nandigram. 

 We should not forget that the people there have been denied justice. None of those responsible for the March 14 mass killing has been punished , Chowdhury said. 

 State party working pre- sident Pradip Bhattacharya confirmed receiving the chief ministers request to discuss the Haldia hub. We shall not take a hasty decision. Instead, we shall seek the high commands green signal, he said.

 Mukherjee said the party should take a cue from Mamata Banerjee, who has boycotted the meeting. We should not collaborate with the CPM on any issue, he said. 

 Loyalists of former state chief Somen Mitra felt there was no alternative to seeking a central directive as the party had faced flak after the all-party meeting on Nandigram.

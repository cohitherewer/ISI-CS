 BRIEFS

 Bhadreswar, Sept. 14: A school here in Hooghly has been shut down indefinitely after a snake slithered into a classroom today.

 Teacher Soma Pal started sobbing as the snake crawled into Class VII and the students ran out. Other teachers and non-teaching employees came rushing but every one was scared to enter the class. The snake hid under a pile of pipes and could not be located.

 Kharagpur: Two girls were crushed by a truck near here on their way from school. Lachmi Rai, 11, and Christien Gurung, 8, were crossing a road when knocked down.

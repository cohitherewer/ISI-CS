The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Pension order

 Calcutta, Sept. 11: The government cannot slash the retirement benefits of employees even if they have been paid in excess during their service tenure, the high court said today.

 The state cant deprive an employee of retirement benefits for a fault it had committed, the judge said. A Birbhum teacher had been told to pay Rs 2.3 lakh for his pension.

 Goon held: Pramod Singh, who was wanted in at least seven murder cases, was arrested in Gaya, Bihar, late tonight. 

 Police said the Howrah goon was involved in many other cases, including car theft.

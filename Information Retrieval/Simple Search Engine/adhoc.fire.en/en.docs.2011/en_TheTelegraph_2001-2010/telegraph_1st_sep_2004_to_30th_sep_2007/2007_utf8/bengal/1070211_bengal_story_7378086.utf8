The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cops body found

 Feb. 10: Three days after he went missing, the body of sub-inspector Sadhucharan Chatterjee, 59, was fished out of the Haldi this morning, around 9 km upstream from Ishwardaha, reports our bureau.

 Farmers noticed a sack, with legs protruding out of it, floating near Uttar Gumari Char, 90 km from Calcutta.

 Chatterjee was suspected to have been killed in Ishwardaha on Wednesday by villagers protesting against land acquisition. Police said they had reason to think the killing was a professional job.

 There are injury marks on the skull, another on the right of his mouth and a third across the lower abdomen, a police officer said.

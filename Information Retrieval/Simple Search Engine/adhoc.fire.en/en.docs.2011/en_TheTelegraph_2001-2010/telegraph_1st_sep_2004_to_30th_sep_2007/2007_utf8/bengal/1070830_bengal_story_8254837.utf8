 Plane smoke

 Calcutta, Aug. 29: Smoke billowed out of the rear wheel of an Air India plane from Calcutta as it landed in Kathmandu this afternoon.

 All 56 passengers were offloaded and there were no injuries, an airline official said. 

 The IC-748 flight had taken off around 1.50pm and reached Kathmandu an hour later. The smoke was seen coming out of the rear wheel as the aircraft was slowing down. 

 The return flight was can-celled. The Calcutta-bound passengers were sent via Delhi and Varanasi, the airline official said.

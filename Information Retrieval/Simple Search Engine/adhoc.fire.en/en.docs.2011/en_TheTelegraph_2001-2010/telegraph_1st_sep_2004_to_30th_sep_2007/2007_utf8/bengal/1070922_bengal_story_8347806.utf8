 Siliguri, Sept. 21: Three 10-year-old boys were beaten up and plunged into a well with their hands and legs tied up last night because they had allegedly stolen flowers. 

 Suman Saha, Raju Roy and Tapas Chakraborty were kept hanging in the well with their heads pointing down. 

 Shankar Dey, 45, has been arrested for the torture. A hunt has begun for his brothers Paritosh and Sanjay. The trio had called the boys out of their home. 

 The parents let them go thinking the reprimand will be good for the children.

 The Deys had complained to the parents about the theft. We thought they will scold the children for doing something they should not have, said Rajus mother Soma.

 Tapas was taken to the Siliguri district hospital with what doctors said were pricks from something pointed. 

 The women of the Dey family allegedly helped the trio lower the boys in the well in their house. We were kept hanging and plunged into the water. I was scared, said Suman.

 Ganesh Das, a neighbour of the Deys in South Bharatpur, said the childrens wails alerted them. The three were locked inside the Dey house.

 All other members of the family have fled.

 Tapass father Swapan admitted that his son had stolen flowers. But he did not deserve that punishment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Goons and guns snatched

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, March 11: A CID team from Calcutta had to virtually run to safety early this morning after residents of two Nadia villages snatched four men accused of planning a robbery from custody.

 The villagers also took away two revolvers from the CID personnel during the scuffle but they managed to retrieve the arms and retain two of those arrested in their custody.

 Seven CID personnel in plainclothes led by deputy sup- erintendent D.N. Goswami swooped down on Kinupota and Tentulberia villages around 1.30 am, looking for six men who had allegedly planned a robbery in the area.

 Villagers claimed they were innocent. 

 At Kinupota, about 130 km from Calcutta, the CID team broke into Ahatulla Sheikhs house. His wife Roshanara said: My husband did not step out as it was late in the night. But they broke open the door and dragged him out. When I protested, the officer (Majumder) flashed his identity card and kicked me.

 A musket and six bullets were apparently seized during the raid, of which the local police knew nothing. Only after arresting the two did they go to the Nakashipara police station and lodge an FIR, Nadia superintendent H.K. Kusumakar said. 

 They have been booked on charges of plotting a heist and possessing illegal arms, said Bijoy Chatterjee, an assistant public prosecutor.

 Roshanara alleged that the CID team planted a musket in our house. 

 Her brother-in-law Pakirul was also held. Villagers said the brothers were farmers and cultivated their own land.

 From Ahatullas house, the CID team went to neighbouring Tentulberia.

 As Roshanara raised an alarm, some 300 villagers rushed out, armed with sticks and scythes. They followed the trail left by the CIDs Gypsy. 

 Near Tentulberia, the villagers spotted the sleuths with four others Bablu Sheikh, his brothers Khalip and Insan, and neighbour Shamim. 

 Bablus sister-in-law is a Congress panchayat member and his arrest led to a hue and cry and hundreds came out.

 The police were taking away innocent people we resisted, said Shahabul Mondal of Tentulberia. 

 A mob of about 500 gheraoed the CID team. Before the six could be pushed into the car, we snatched their revolvers and four of our men, but not Ahatulla and Bablu, said Hossainur Sheikh. 

 CID inspector-general D.P. Tarania said the force had evidence to prove that all six had planned the heist. They were picked on the basis of specific information, he said, adding: A massive hunt is on to track down the four who fled.

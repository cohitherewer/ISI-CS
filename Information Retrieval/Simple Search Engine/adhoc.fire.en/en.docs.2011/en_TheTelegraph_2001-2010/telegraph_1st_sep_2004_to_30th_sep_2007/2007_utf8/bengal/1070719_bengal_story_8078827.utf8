 Jewellery looted

 Calcutta, July 18: Five youths stepped out of a Tata Sumo with their heads wrapped in cloth, walked into a jewellery shop at Survey Park and took away a booty worth Rs 1 lakh.

 The five, armed with revolvers and daggers, sped away towards EM Bypass after the raid, the South 24-Parganas police said.

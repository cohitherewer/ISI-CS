 Mamata spares Tata wall

 Calcutta, April 11: Mamata Banerjees brigade will no longer try to bring down the wall around Tata Motors Singur site.

 Our agitation on Singur will be through peaceful means and we will not pull down the wall being raised for the Tata plant, the Trinamul Congress chief told a rally at Esplanade today. 

 Members of the Trinamul-backed Save Farmland Committee had almost made it a habit to hoodwink security personnel and damage the wall.

 Parading villagers who had not accepted compensation for their land in Singur, Mamata added that the Tatas would be compelled to demolish the wall themselves.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Valuables cleaned out of air baggage

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 2: A woman from Houston, Texas, and a central government official have allegedly been robbed of cash, camera, cosmetics and clothes that were in their registered baggage on flights to and from Calcutta airport.

 Ruma Rakshit was coming to see her son at Lake Gardens from the US. On May 23, she boarded a Lufthansa flight from Texas with a stopover at Frankfurt.

 At Frankfurt, Ruma had to change aircraft. She was carrying four bags as registered luggage. When she landed here, none of them arrived, said her son Abhishek. 

 Ruma informed Lufthansa about the missing bags. They assured us that the baggage would be delivered intact. But when we received the four bags on May 26, two of them were damaged, Abhishek alleged. 

 The lock on one had been broken while another suitcase had been slashed from the side, Rumas complaint at the airport police station said.

 The valuables missing were said to be worth $1,500. Besides, $600 in cash also went missing.

 The same day, the family apparently informed Lufthansa about the suspected theft and emailed a complaint two days later. But the airline did not give us any information, the son alleged. 

 Ruma lodged a complaint with Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport police station yesterday.

 The mishandling of baggage or loss of valuables should be immediately reported to us. We provide compensation after a proper inquiry, a Lufthansa official said. 

 A. Roychowdhury, an Ordnance Factory director, too, lodged a complaint with the airport police yesterday. 

 He went to Kathmandu from Calcutta on an Indian flight on May 22. Reaching the hotel, he apparently found Rs 27,000 missing. 

 Roychowdhury felt the theft could have taken place when the luggage was being scanned at the X-Ray machine in Calcutta airport. 

 We are looking into the matter seriously, an Indian official said. 

 The police said mishandling and non-arrival of luggage has increased recently. 

 Airport officials alleged that a section of ground handling staff is to be blamed. Many airlines have outsourced their ground handling to other agencies.

 An official said passengers are always advised not to carry valuables in their registered baggage. All airlines give the same advice to passengers across the globe.

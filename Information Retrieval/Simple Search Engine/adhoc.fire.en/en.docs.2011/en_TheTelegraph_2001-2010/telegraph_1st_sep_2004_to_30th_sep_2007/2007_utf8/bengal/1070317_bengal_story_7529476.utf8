 Tower torched in Singur fury

 Singur, March 16: As Nandigram burned, Singur, the flashpoint of the anti-land acquisition drive, turned on the heat today. 

 After a gap of one-and-a-half months, the Tata Motors project site in Singur witnessed a string of demonstrations through the day. Members of the Trinamul Congress-led Save Farmland Committee tried to uproot the fencing around the plot and set a watchtower on fire. 

 Trouble erupted at 9.30 this morning when a crowd of around 200 assembled at the site of the small car factory, around 50 km from Calcutta.

 Although they failed to uproot any of the pillars supporting the fencing, they tore a 20-metre iron net to shreds before police intervened. The demonstrators fled when we gave them chase, an officer said. 

 As the police kept these protesters at bay, a mob came from another side around 2 pm and torched one of the 50 watchtowers at the site. Its tarpaulin shed was gutted. The agitators then hurled a burning ball of cloth at the police.

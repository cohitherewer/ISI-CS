 Coach in custody over shooter attack

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Serampore, March 8: Medal-winning shooter Seuli Sadhukhans former coach has been arrested on suspicion that money meant to buy a rifle is linked to the attack on her yesterday.

 Swapan Sanyal was arrested last night on the basis of an FIR lodged by Seulis father after three motorcycle-borne youths shot at her in Serampore, around 40 km from Calcutta. Another person named in the FIR, Sudipta Singha Roy, is absconding.

 Seuli underwent surgery this morning at the Medical College and Hospital in Calcutta and her condition was stated to be stable.

 According to Salil Ganguly, inspector in charge of Serampore police station, Sanyal has been arrested on the basis of allegations made by Seulis father Gobinda. Sanyal and Sudipta have been named suspects in the FIR. We believe the two can help us in the probe. But we do not have strong evidence against them yet, Ganguly said.

 Gobinda told the police that Sanyal and Singha Roy had harassed Seuli in the past and could have had a hand in yesterdays attack.

 Seuli used to train under Sanyal, the coach of Serampore Rifle Club, five years ago. She had received a grant of Rs 1,40,000 from sports minister Subhas Chakraborty and gave Rs 80,000 to Sanyal to buy her a good air rifle. But Sanyal never bought it. When she confronted him two years ago, he started returning the money in instalments, Ganguly said.

 According to Gobinda, Singha Roy used to threaten Seuli over the phone.

 Singha Roys brother Arindam was Seulis coach for a while. He died in a road mishap one-and-a-half years ago. Since then, Sudipta has been alleging that my daughter was responsible for the death and making threat calls. We had traced the calls to Sudiptas number after installing a caller line identification device, Gobinda said.

 Sanyal has been remanded in police custody till March 10.

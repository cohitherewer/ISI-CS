 Lalu, Priya in trouble over train

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 2: Lalu Prasad, who had ordered the termination of a train scheduled to travel to Balurghat in Malda, and his cabinet colleague Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who had requested the move, have been told by the high court to justify their actions.

 A division bench hearing a PIL filed by Balurghat residents today directed the two to file separate affidavits. Railway minister Lalu Prasad has to say whether he had the authority to stop the Calcutta-Malda Gour Express in its tracks without the approval of the railway board, which had ordered an extension of its journey.

 The information and broadcasting minister has to say what prompted him to make a request that went against the boards decision.

 The judges asked the railways to file another affidavit on whether the railway act permits a minister to violate a Railway Board decision.

 The petitioners had annexed copies of the correspondence between the ministers in which Das Munshi said as the train was introduced by former railway minister Ghani Khan Chowdhury, of Malda, it wouldnt be fair to alter its route. 

 Balurghat residents have been clamouring for a direct train to Calcutta for decades.

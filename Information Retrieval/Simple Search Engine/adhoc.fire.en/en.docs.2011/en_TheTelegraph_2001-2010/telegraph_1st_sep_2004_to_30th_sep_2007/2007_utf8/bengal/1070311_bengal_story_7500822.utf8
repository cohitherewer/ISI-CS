 Plan for soft skill school

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 10: Finishing schools are the flavour of the season as institutes offering professional courses gear up to address the problem of employability of the hundreds of students being churned out by them.

 Responding to apprehensions that the growth of the corporate sector may be hampered because of shortage of employable youths, the National School of Hotel Management (NSHM) Knowledge Campus is planning to set up its own finishing school initiative, Fine Cube.

 What the finishing school will aim to do is develop the overall personality of the student and not just focus on technical and communication skills, said Krishnendu Sarkar, head, learning services, NSHM.

 Employability is not just about augmenting soft skills in terms of communication skills. Other skills such as lifestyle management, crisis management and lateral thinking are also equally important, said NSHM chief mentor Cecil Anthony.

 The institute plans to create the ultimate in finishing schools. 

 The first step in this direction is a tie-up with the Mumbai-based De Bono School of Lateral Thinking and Cognitive Intelligence for setting up the NSHM-De Bono Centre of Innovation and Thinking Management at the NSHM Knowledge Campus in Tollygunge.

 The courses offered will be enhanced by the cognitive tools to be taught. The idea is to use these tools to give students an edge over others when it comes to employability, said Peter Burns De Bono, lateral thinking and cognitive intelligence expert.

 The centre at NSHM will provide training in lateral thinking and De Bono tools and techniques such as Six Thinking Hats.

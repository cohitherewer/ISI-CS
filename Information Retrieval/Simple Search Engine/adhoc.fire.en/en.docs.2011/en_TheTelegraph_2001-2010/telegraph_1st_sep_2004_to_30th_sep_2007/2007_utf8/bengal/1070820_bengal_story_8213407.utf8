 BRIEFS

 Malda, Aug. 19: The Ganga, flowing above the extreme danger level, has gobbled up two villages in Manikchak over the past four days, forcing nearly 150 people to take shelter on higher ground.

 The situation is also grim in Ratua I block, where the Phulhar river has flooded four villages following incessant rain since August 15. Over 350 people have been rendered homeless and 3,000 cut off from the rest of the district.

 A 40-year-old woman suffering from an enteric disease died without treatment after the authorities failed to arrange for a boat to take her to a health centre.

 Irrigation department executive engineer Soumen Mitra said the water levels of all the rivers passing through the district were rising. 

 Asansol: Ramesh Tanti, 40, an Eastern Coalfields Limited security guard, died after being beaten up by villagers in Salanpur, 240km from Calcutta. The company said the villagers were trying to steal coal when Tanti resisted.

 Kulti: Chandan Roy, 15, was killed and his friend Deepak Ghosh, 16, injured when the Barakars bank caved in on Monday. Police said the duo went to the river to bathe in the afternoon when the landslide occurred in Kulti, 260km from Calcutta.

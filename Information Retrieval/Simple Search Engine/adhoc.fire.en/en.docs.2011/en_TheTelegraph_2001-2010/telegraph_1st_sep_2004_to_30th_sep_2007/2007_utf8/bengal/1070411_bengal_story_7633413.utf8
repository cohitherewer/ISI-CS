The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Sen sees ripples before big leap

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 10: In its first interface with industry since the Nandigram flare-up last month, the government tried to allay investors fears iterating its commitment to industrialisation.

 Speaking at the annual meeting of the Confederation of Indian Industrys (CII) eastern chapter, industries minister Nirupam Sen sought to play down the unrest against land acquisition but said the government would take peoples apprehensions into account while formulating its policy.

 We cannot avoid ripples in a society that is poised for a big leap. We should not ignore it, Sen said.

 He went on to compare Bengals situation with that of 18th century England, poised for industrial revolution, and Southeast Asia post-World War II. It is only a natural phenomena. It is an indication that Bengal is poised for growth, Sen said, to an applause from the audience. 

 The minister urged industry to also address peoples and peasants concerns. 

 The industry sang the Sen tune. We completely agree with him, said CII chairman R. Seshasayee, adding that a share of the gains from a new project should also go to the landowners, share croppers and tillers.

 An industrialist who did not want to be named said it was good on Sens part to admit that Bengal was facing a problem and there are apprehensions among people. We wanted to hear that the industrialisation drive will continue and that is exactly what he said.

 It does not mean that the battered confidence of investors would come back soon. The fence-sitters would want to see words translated into action, but the governments positive intent will stand it in good stead, industrialists across the board said.

 Biswadip Gupta, the new chairman of CII, eastern region, and the man in charge of Bengals biggest investment, the Rs 35,000 crore Jindal Steel project, echoed the minister when he said: Manufacturing is a must for even agriculture to grow. One has to link the two.

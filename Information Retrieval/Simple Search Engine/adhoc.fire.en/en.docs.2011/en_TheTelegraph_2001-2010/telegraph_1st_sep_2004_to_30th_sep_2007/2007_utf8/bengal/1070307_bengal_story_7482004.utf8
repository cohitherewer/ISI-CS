The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Acquisition after test case

 OUR BUREAU

 March 6: Singed by trouble over land acquisition, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government has decided to initiate the process of taking over 156 acres out of the 4,870 required for the Dankuni township terming it a test case.

 We are starting the acquisition with only 156 acres. Section 4 notices, declaring the governments intent to acquire the land, have been issued for this area, land reforms commissioner P.K Agarwal said. 

 The rest of the 1600-odd acres to be acquired for the first phase of the project would be touched only after this mission proves to be a success.

 The land reforms department has, on paper, given the Hooghly administration permission to acquire 637 acres at Mollarber, Bhadua and Madhpur mouzas. But officials have been told to wait and watch.

 The district magistrate has already received objections to the first phase of acquisition, said Agarwal.

 If the objections are very strong, we will ask the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) to spare these plots and identify other areas in the vicinity for acquisition, said Agarwal.

 The district administration has been told to initiate a consensus-building process among residents and leaders.

 District magistrate Binod Kumar has convened an all-party meeting on Friday to discuss the acquisition of the land, which would be given on a 999-year lease to real estate company DLF. 

 All parties except the Trinamul Congress confirmed their participation at the meeting today. Trinamuls Mukul Roy said: We will take a decision on Friday itself.

 District magistrate Binod Kumar said: We would try to build a consensus on the acquisition and the compensation to be given to landlosers.

 We are not opposed to the township. But we want a mechanism to ensure jobs and other benefits for the displaced, said Pritam Ghosh, the Congress district working president.

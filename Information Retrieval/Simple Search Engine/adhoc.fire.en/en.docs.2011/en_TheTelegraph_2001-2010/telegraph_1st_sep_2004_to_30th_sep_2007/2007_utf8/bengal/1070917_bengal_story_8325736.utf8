 Drop-out zero after blind mans school vigil

 - Spreading 

 light of education 

 Haradhan Ghosh outside the school

 He lost his eyesight at the age of 10 and had to stop studying, but students and teachers of a Murshidabad school cannot escape his vigil. 

 Haradhan Ghosh, the self-styled inspector of Banti Primary School in Murshidabad, informs parents if their children are frequently late for school. He also complains to the local sub-inspector of schools if a teacher is not on time. If a student drops out, Haradhan is at his doorstep to persuade him back to class.

 The 32-year-old lost his eyesight after a bout of small pox. I had an attack of small pox, became blind at the age of 10 and was forced to drop out of school in Class IV. I have vowed that children will not stay out of primary school in Banti village. Without education a person cannot be complete, Haradhan said.

 His efforts have borne fruit. There has not been a single drop-out in this school for the past two years and teachers and students arrive on time. This is how Haradhan has been working silently for Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, said Wasim Mirza, teacher-in-charge of the school, about 230km from Calcutta.

 Last year, Mirza said, Haradhan persuaded Jinarul Sardar to return to school. The Class IV student had stopped coming because he wanted to work to help his family. Jinaruls father was crippled in a road accident seven years ago and the family was dependent on the paltry earnings of his elder brother. Haradhan went to his house and persuaded him to return to school. He raised money from villagers to help Jinarul and also bought him a new shirt, the teacher-in-charge said.

 Two months back, Srikanta Mondal of Class II stopped attending classes. He, too, wanted to help his daily labourer father by tending goats. Haradhan visited Srikantas house and brought him back to the school, said Mirza.

 The schools nearly 200 students and five teachers are scared to come late. We know that Haradhan will immediately report against us to the school inspector or complain to the guardians, Mirza said.

 The school authorities want Haradhan to continue his vigil. He has also been allowed to stay inside the school building at night.

 Haradhan hails from a family of daily labourers. He lost his parents shortly after he lost his eyesight. Although he has been living with his two elder brothers, Amrita and Rabindranath, being daily labourers, they could not help him much. 

 Three years ago, Talim Sheikh, the then headmaster of the primary school, took pity on Haradhan and started giving him Rs 300 every month. Haradhan started going to the school regularly and mixing with the students and teachers. I dont remember when I started monitoring the arrival of students and teachers. I used to ask students about punctuality and that is how I got started, he said.

 After headmaster Talim Sheikh retired, Biplab Kumar Roy, the school inspector for Murshidabad (east circle), took up the responsibility to pay Haradhan his Rs 300 every month. Haradhan is an asset to the school, Roy said.

 CPM state secretary 

 Biman Bose consoles at a rally in Calcutta a woman who 

 fled Nandigram. The party organised a show of solidarity 

 for supporters evicted from Nandigram by Opposition 

 forces. Around 330 oustees began a dharna at a makeshift 

 camp on Rani Rashmoni Road. Two teams, including women, 

 met governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi and members of the 

 state womens commission. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya 

 Nandigram, March 20: CPM 

 supporters who had to flee their homes have been in the 

 news. But away from the public eye, nearly 500 villagers 

 from the Left stronghold of Khejuri who had raised their 

 voice against land acquisition in Nandigram have taken shelter 

 in camps opened yesterday in Sonachura and Garchakraberia.

 These villagers, who took shelter 

 in the four camps in Sonachura and Garchakraberia, say they 

 were forced to flee as they could not cope with the CPMs 

 muscle power.

 According to the list of mouzas 

 made public by MP Lakshman Seth last December, Sahebnagar 

 and Balibasti in Khejuri Block II were likely to figure 

 in the governments acquisition plans.

 Initially, we depended on 

 the Nandigram movement, thinking that if their campaign 

 proved successful, our land in Khejuri would also be saved. 

 However, when the CPM workers killed villagers opposed to 

 land acquisition in Nandigram on January 7, we couldnt 

 sit quiet any longer. We began our own anti-acquisition 

 movement in Khejuri Block II, says Sheikh Akkash Ali, 

 a resident of Kaderabachher village in Khejuris Sahebnagar 

 mouza, who is now camping at Sonachura.

 The villagers dug up roads leading 

 to the village to cut themselves off from CPM cadres and 

 the administration.

 As the movement gathered momentum, 

 their persecution at the hands of the CPM increased. 

 On February 15, CPM cadres 

 attacked our houses, demanding to know how we could dare 

 to go against them in their bastion. They demanded that 

 I pay a fine of Rs 10,000 for having joined the anti-acquisition 

 movement. I had no choice but to flee, says 65-year-old 

 Sheikh Moinuddin from Kaderabachher.

 The villagers say their movement 

 caught on within a short time. In a span of 26 days, 

 about 15,000 to 20,000 villagers were with us. We had the 

 support of 80 per cent of the population but the rest 20 

 per cent had arms and muscle power. We couldnt match 

 their strength and were forced to flee, says Kalipada 

 Sith, 35, from the same village. 

 Sith now lives in perpetual fear 

 of what the cadres might do to his family. He has left his 

 wife and five-year-old child behind. Ive heard 

 that theyve harvested the paddy from my 2.6-bigha 

 plot and have also taken away all the fish from my pond. 

 Theyve driven away my old mother to another relatives 

 house in Nandigram. At night, they come and threaten my 

 wife that theyll set fire to the house, he says.

 Seventy-six-year-old Amar Ali 

 also fled after he was asked to pay a fine of Rs 5,000. 

 Three of his sons and his son-in-law, who were also part 

 of the movement in Khejuri, have fled to Orissa.

 More than 3,000 have taken shelter 

 in the camps. While about 400 are from Khejuri, the rest 

 are from areas bordering the Talpatti canal. The police, 

 they claim, never gave them protection.

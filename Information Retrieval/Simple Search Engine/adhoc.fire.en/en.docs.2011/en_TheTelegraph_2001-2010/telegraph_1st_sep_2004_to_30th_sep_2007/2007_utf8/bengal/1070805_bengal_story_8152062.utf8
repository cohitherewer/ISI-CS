 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Aug. 4: The baby found in a taxi at Gariahat has been sent to Sukanya Home, a state-run centre for orphans in Salt Lake.

 Doctors at Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratisthan, where the girl believed to be four days old was taken for a check-up, said she was fit. Polices efforts to locate her parents proved futile today.

 Bank to parent orphan girls

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 12: The State Bank of India will adopt orphan girls and almost give them a blank cheque to build their lives.

 Each of the banks 785 branches in Bengal will pick one such girl. 

 Orphaned girls between 8 and 14 will be adopted, said Ashok Mukund, the chief general manager of the banks Bengal circle. 

 The girls will be picked with the help of customers or local bodies. We shall see to it that they can establish themselves in life, Mukund said on a visit to the town.

 The girls will be free to study what they wish to, though the banks focus will be on getting them to choose medicine, engineering and other professional courses.

 She can study whatever she is interested in or is good at. Well provide training in vocational and technical studies and help her develop English skills, said Mukund. 

 Those in Bengali medium schools will also be trained in English, possibly through special coaching. Girls picked in urban areas will be given the option of enrolling in English medium schools.

 A survey by the bank early this year revealed that 60 per cent of orphaned girls in the state have to stop their studies midway.

 Special shelters will be arranged for the girls if necessary, Mukund said, adding that branch officials would look after them.

 The branch will find shelters for girls who dont have one. If necessary, an employee of the bank may raise her with his family after consulting the local administration. The bank will provide the money, an official said.

 Orders to start the scheme have already been issued. Mukunds colleague S.B. Nayar, the Bengal circle general manager, said those adopted will be called model SBI girls.

 Money for the scheme would come from the banks welfare kitty, officials said. Mukund promised that funds wouldnt be a problem.

 Officials said the adoption plan would be among the banks social responsibilities, at a time when loan recoveries from farmers have improved dramatically. Default rates have more than halved from 11 per cent over the past year. 

 According to Nayar, 95 per cent of the farmers have repaid loans. We are reciprocating by adopting the orphaned girls, he said.

 The idea came up during a meeting in Calcutta last month where bank officials were taking note of the higher loan recovery.

 The Bengal initiative, Mukund said, would be extended to the rest of the country.

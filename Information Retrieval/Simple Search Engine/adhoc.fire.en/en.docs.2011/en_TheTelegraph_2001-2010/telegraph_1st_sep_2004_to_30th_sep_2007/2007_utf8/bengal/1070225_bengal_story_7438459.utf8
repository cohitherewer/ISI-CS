The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Friend killed for love

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 24: They both loved wine, belonged to the same village in Jharkhand and were friends until they fell in love with the same woman.

 A tug of war over a prostitute from Sonagachhi drove Santosh Das to kill friend Arjun Das, a group-D staff of a private company on February 16. Santosh and his aide, Pradip Jha, were arrested today.

 Arjun was found lying in a pool of blood at the companys office on Bentinck Street, where he also lived.

 Twenty-two-year-old Santosh, who was arrested from Salt Lake hours after Pradip was picked up, told police that Arjun was going to take away the woman he loved and so he decided to kill him.

 Santosh was the babu of a woman from Sonagachhi, who not only paid him a monthly salary but had even gifted him a motorcycle. Ever since Arjun started visiting Sonagachhi and professed his love for this woman, Santosh began to feel insecure, said Gyanwant Singh, the police detective chief.

 We are still not convinced about the motive. This may be only one of the reasons, for the two also wanted to make some quick money.

 There could be more than one person directly involved in this murder, Singh said, adding that the assassins had taken away a small iron trunk that had 26 silver coins from the Victorian era. We have recovered 16 of these coins from Pradip.

 The cops learnt that on the night of February 16, Santosh and Arjun had visited Sonagachhi where they drank heavily. 

 They left around 9.45 pm, when one of the locals saw Santosh almost dragging an inebriated Arjun into a taxi. On the way, Santosh went to Bowbazar and bought a steel chopper. He also picked up some food and drinks. 

 At the office, the two had another round of drinks, after which Santosh first strangled Arjun and then cut his throat with the steel chopper.

 Before leaving, he ransacked the office and took around Rs 10,000 and Arjuns mobile phone. 

 Police said Pradip was Santoshs friend and would also frequent Sonagachhi. He had been aware of the plot and the murder. 

 Pradip was planning to cross over to Bangladesh when he was arrested at the border in North 24-Parganas late on Friday.

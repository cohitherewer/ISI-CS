The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Goon arrest

 Calcutta, Sept. 7: The high court today asked police to re-arrest goon Tapas Das better known as Bulton and his associates in a murder case.

 All 10, including Bulton whom police described as a dreaded gangster, had been absolved of the charge of killing businessmen Samir Hawladar and Shankar Biswas by the Barasat court. The government challenged the verdict. 

 The police had initially said they were killed in gang war.

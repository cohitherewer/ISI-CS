The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Reliance food plan scales a wall

 A Reliance Fresh outlet

 Calcutta, Aug. 13: Reliance Retails farm marketing venture in Bengal has crossed another hurdle. 

 The food processing and horticulture department has cleared Mukesh Ambanis proposal to set up six distribution-cum-processing centres, tagging them food processing units, which enables them to get around the land ceiling law. 

 However, Reliances bid to procure farmers produce directly from them and sell it through its Fresh outlets is still facing opposition within the Left Front. The Forward Bloc, RSP and the CPI have accused the CPM of allowing backdoor entry to Reliance in retail in Bengal while opposing corporate forays in retail elsewhere. 

 The food processing minister, CPMs Mohanta Chatterjee, today questioned the licence raj being advocated by the allies. But he admitted that his clearance would not pave the way for direct procurement or setting up Reliance Town Centres, the entertainment hubs with supermarkets and retail outlets to sell fruits and vegetables. 

 Bloc leader and agriculture marketing minister Murtazza Hossein repeated his partys anti-Reliance tirade and insisted his departments licence held the key to its plans.

 Chatterjee said his departments technical committee approved the Reliance proposal last week. The committee found the proposed land requirement of 100 acres for each of the six centres justified. As the distribution centres would not only procure vegetables and fruits but contain storage and processing facilities and also manufacture food products, we have no problem in considering them as food processing units, Chatterjee said. 

 The land ceiling law allows industries to hold ceiling-surplus land. Land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah also of the CPM said if Chatterjees department clears the land requirement, a cabinet approval for the ceiling exemption wouldnt be necessary.

 Chatterjee said the Reliance plan did not include procurement of foodgrain, as it had envisaged earlier, to avoid a hue and cry over corpo-rate monopoly. Reliance would also not engage in contract farming. It wants the government to decide a minimum procurement price. 

 We are yet to get all clarifications on operational as- pects such as procurement and pricing. Its difficult to standardise the minimum procurement price of perishable goods but we are thinking about it, Chatterjee said.

 Its the job of another department to allow direct procurement. But what is the problem if one wants to buy directly from farmers? Why should Reliance have to ask for permission to set up retail outlets? Chatterjee asked.

 Cash maybe, comparison no

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 3: Jyoti Basu today did not rule out the possibility of the government paying compensation to the victims of police firing in Nandigram, though he refused to draw a parallel between the bloodshed there and in Khammam.

 Seven Left supporters demanding land for farmers fell to police bullets in Andhra Pradesh last Saturday. The police firing in Nandigram had led to 14 deaths on March 14.

 The CPM patriarch said paying compensation was a possibility, but the government was not bound to do so.

 The Trinamul Congress and the CPMs Left Front partners the Forward Bloc, RSP and the CPI have been pressuring Writers Buildings to emulate Andhras Congress government, which has promised compensation, jobs and land to the victims families.

 Compensation can be paid on humanitarian grounds. It is not a big issue, though the government is not bound to do so. But we have to wait for the high court order on the cases related to the Nandigram firing, Jyoti Basu said, with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee standing behind him, after the CPM state secretariat meeting. 

 Mamata Banerjee, however, said the compensation should have been paid immediately. The government sat tight for four months. Thirteen people died on July 21, 1993. Similar incidents occurred in Bhangar, Shantipur and Barasat. But the government did nothing. I had raised this issue during my meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. He must have enquired about it, she said.

 Basu, however, dismissed the Left Front partners democratic tag on the Nandigram agitation and criticism of the police firing. The Nandigram agitation is undemocratic. In Khammam, it is a democratic movement for land reforms. The Andhra Pradesh government realised that and paid the compensation and transferred the police officers responsible for the firing, he said.

 He cited the divisional commissioners probe into the Nandigram firing and iterated that the police were compelled to open fire. 

 No government, he added, can tolerate a state within a state and more police would be deployed in the occupied territory.

 The Trinamul chief said Basu wasnt speaking his mind, but parroting what the government and the party wanted him to. He spoke about CPM supporters creating trouble from Khejuri when I met him. It would have been better for Jyotibabu to visit Nandigram rather than echo Buddhababu, Mamata said.

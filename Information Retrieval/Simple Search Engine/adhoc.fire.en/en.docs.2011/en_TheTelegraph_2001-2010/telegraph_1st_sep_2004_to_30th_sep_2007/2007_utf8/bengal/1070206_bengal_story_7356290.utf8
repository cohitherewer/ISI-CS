The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Trinamul raid and flare-up fear

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Feb. 5: Hours after Mamata Banerjee had left Nandigram, Trinamul Congress activists stormed a CPM leaders house in Khejuri and ransacked a party office. 

 Pranab Das was not at home when his brother, sister-in-law and their two children had to flee home to escape a mob of over 200 people.

 The furniture inside the house at Satsimili village, 170 km from Calcutta, and its tiled roof were smashed and the kitchen ransacked.

 The deputy chief of Khejuri panchayat samiti was at a party meeting at the time. A widower, Das said his family took shelter at a relatives.

 The Trinamul mob later raided the party office and broke its doors and destroyed papers, flags and festoons. 

 Trinamul men set on fire the houses of seven CPM supporters yesterday. Earlier, they dug up roads between Khejuri and Nandigram to prevent police from moving in. 

 At a rally yesterday, Mamata justified digging roads and destroying approach roads to bridges. We shall go for a more violent movement if the government does not stop acquiring farmland for ind-ustry, Sheikh Jaharat, a Trinamul leader, warned today.

 Faced with repeated attacks, nearly 10,000 CPM supporters armed with spears, rods and sickles assembled at Kamarda and Kunjupur and demanded action against the Trinamul activists. Many of them refused to return home till late evening despite repeated pleading by leaders.

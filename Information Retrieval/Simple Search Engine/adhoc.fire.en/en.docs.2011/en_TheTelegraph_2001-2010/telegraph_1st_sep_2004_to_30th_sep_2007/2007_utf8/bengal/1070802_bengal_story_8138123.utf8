The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Buddha firm on hub, bent on consensus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 1: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said an all-party meeting on the proposed chemical hub will be called soon after the government writes back to the parties on their queries and apprehensions. 

 On the concluding day of the budget session, Bhattacharjee iterated in the Assembly his resolve to go ahead with the hub. What happened in Nandigram was unfortunate but we cant drop the plan to set up the chemical hub. Its a central government project and Bengal has emerged a front-runner among states rooting for it, he said. 

 Renewing his appeal to the Opposition for co-operation, he said: We want to move ahead on the basis of consensus. The industries minister and myself will reply to the political parties and then convene the all-party meeting. 

 In response to the chief ministers note on the proposed hub, the CPM allies and the Congress had expressed apprehensions over its environmental impact and control over foreign companies known to produce materials for chemical warfare. 

 The Trinamul Congress has not responded to the note. 

 Bhattacharjee said there was consensus on projects like the Bhusan steel plant in Burdwan and the Jindal steel plant in West Midnapore, but Singur and Nandigram continued to fester.

 Why is the Opposition refusing to understand that the car unit in Singur is the harbinger for further investment? We are trying hard to translate the emerging possibilities for industrialisation and development into reality. The volume of potential investment was never so huge. I hope the Opposition will appreciate it and let us work together to implement the big projects.

 Earlier, industries minister Nirupam Sen rejected a motion tabled by the Congress demanding jobs for landlosers in industries coming up on their land and equity participation.

 Congress legislative leader Manas Bhuniya demanded an increase in the compensation for landlosers in accordance with the estimated value of the land 20 years after an industrial unit has been built on it.

 Sen made it clear that the government would not stick its neck out to meet those demands. The current law neither permits any increase in the valuation of acquired land assuming future increase in its price nor cares for rehabilitation of the landlosers. We have written to the Centre to amend the law making rehabilitation an integral part of the acquisition and compensation process, he said. 

 The Jindals are offering a job and shares to every landloser family but, Sen said, the government cannot make it mandatory for all industries. It would be discriminatory. The railways and other public sector bodies do not follow the same policy. What will happen to those whose land is acquired for roads or bridges? 

 CPI threat

 The CPI threatened to pull out of the delegation to Khammam following CPM leader Benoy Konars justification of the Nandigram firing. A CPI-CPM joint team is scheduled to visit Khammam, where six persons were killed in police firing. Konar had said the party was not ashamed of the Nandigram firing, which led to 14 deaths.

 Mamata battle

 ANINDYA SENGUPTA

 Calcutta, Feb. 1: Mamata Banerjee is preparing to strengthen her party following reports of alienation among a section of the Trinamul Congress over losing out to ultra Leftists in the movement against acquisition of farmland.

 Mamata has written to the partys district and block committees seeking their suggestions. 

 The Trinamul Congress chief has also convened a meeting on February 9 to discuss how to rebuild the party and work out a strategy to intensify the agitation against farmland acquisition.

 Mamatadi has now realised that her party is not getting due importance (in the land agitation) and that Trinamul functionaries are not happy (that the party is losing its grip). Thats why she decided to write to party leaders in the districts, a party MLA and close aide of Mamata said.

 Prashant Tamang on his way to Darjeeling last week 

 Darjeeling, Sept. 9: Mobile recharge cards in pockets and nimble fingers on their phones, Prashant Tamangs fans are gearing up for one last push that will make their hero an Idol.

 But not sure if that will be enough, they want Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to campaign for the Calcutta police constable. 

 The man from the hills has made it to the last two of Indian Idol, the talent hunt show. It is now a straight fight with Amit Paul of Shillong.

 The chief minister of Meghalaya has asked the people to vote for Amit. He has even been made the states brand ambassador. Now we expect the chief minister of Bengal and his cabinet to drum up support for Tamang. After all he is the pride of the state, said Tenzing Khambachay, a ward commissioner of Darjeeling municipality.

 Sikkim chief minister Pawan Chamling has endeared himself to the people here by coming out in Tamangs support.

 Amit got more votes than Prashant in the last round. To make sure that it did not happen again, a new Prashant Fan Club was formed in Darjeeling today. 

 Bimal Gurung, a GNLF leader who heads the club, apparently stayed awake on Friday night to text votes worth Rs 1.5 lakh.

 Residents of Rink Mall have opened three coin booths and will set up another seven to help those who do not want to burn holes in their pocket.

 Coin booths, sponsored by local clubs or individuals, are coming up in Jorebunglow, Pokhriabong, Sukhiapokhri, Mirik, Kurseong, Kalimpong and other places for the showdown next weekend. 

 We are meeting tomorrow to finalise the plans, Khambachay said. 

 The club has requested service providers to ensure that votes sent from across the hills reach their destination. 

 As soon as the results were declared around 10pm yesterday, hundreds of people from across the hills took to the streets and the party continued past midnight.

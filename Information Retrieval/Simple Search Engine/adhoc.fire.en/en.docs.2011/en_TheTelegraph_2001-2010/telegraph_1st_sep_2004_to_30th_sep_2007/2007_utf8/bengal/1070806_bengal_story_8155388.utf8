 Calcutta, Aug. 5: Buddhadeb 

 Bhattacharjee today told the traditional Left 

 that the educated jobless could not be asked to wait for 

 socialism to bring them deliverance.

 Should we tell the new generation of educated jobless to wait for socialist industrialisation? We cant. We have to seek private sector investment for setting up industry and create jobs, the chief minister told a congregation of comrades on the birth anniversary of Muzaffar Ahmed, the co-founder of the undivided Communist Party.

 The plainspeak from the Marxist pulpit is being seen as a message to critics of the governments priorities and a rare instance where the chief minister has spoken up to send a public message to restive allies.

 Usually, the CPM leaves the task of taking on or responding to allies to leaders like Biman Bose and Benoy Konar, known for their acerbic tongue, taking care to keep Bhattacharjee above such skirmishes.

 He did not say anything that goes against what he has been advocating since he became chief minister.

 But the occasion an event to commemorate the origin of the party in India and the audience a virtual whos who of the state CPMs A-list lent the comments additional gravity and edge.

 Bhattacharjee, who had said in June that a group of Left-leaning economists was not in touch with reality, today expanded the reach of his critique but without naming anyone.

 As long as we fought together for the rights of the farmers and land reforms, there was unity in the Left camp. But now our moves for industrialisation have hurt traditional Left ideas. We know industrialisation is inevitable if we want to consolidate our success in agriculture, he said.

 The chief minister made it clear he had little doubt about the path he has chosen. We have been asked what kind of capital we are seeking to set up industry? Yes, private capital, Bhattacharjee said. 

 But he did try to strike a balance. We know what private capital means and the pain its accumulation brings about. We dont consider market economy the solution to all problems.

 Todays Leftism is to protect those poor farmers, unemployed workers and women whom the market economy has turned marginal, Bhattacharjee said.

 BRIEFS

 Barrackpore, Sept. 9: Residents of Agarpara, on the northern fringes of Calcutta, who were demanding the arrest of a brother-in-law accused of murder, clashed with police this afternoon when asked to lift a blockade on BT Road.

 Anupama Basu Roy was found dead on August 5. Her husband Susham and his elder brother Uttam were named in the FIR. Susham was held but not Uttam, a CPM supporter who is said to be roaming free in the locality in North 24-Parganas. 

 We blocked the road knowing that it would inconvenience many and draw attention to the police shield for the culprit, said Soma Banik. When the police failed to disperse the mob, they wielded the baton. Brickbats were hurled back. Assistant sub-in- spector Partha Roy was hit on the head. Subdivisional police officer Ashoke Roy was slapped. 

 Krishnagar: A Maoist leaders wife was arrested here on Saturday night. Mahamaya Sarkars daughter said she had been framed. She has been charged with plotting a CPM supporters murder, snatching rifles from police and possessing arms and sent to a fortnights jail custody. Her husband Chandi Sarkar is an undertrial housed in Krishnagar jail since 2004. 

 Midnapore: A 19-year-old girl was rescued from a Madhya Pradesh village on Saturday and two persons were held for allegedly selling her there. Police said Sanatan Sahis lured her away from a Jhargram village promising marriage.

 Barasat: A trader climbed a bulldozer and hit its driver with a sharp-edged weapon when his roadside shop in Naihati was being demolished. Police said his plea to be allowed to remove the wares had been turned down.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cave-in alert for Barakar

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE 

 Barakar, June 6: Bharat Coking Coal has issued a notice declaring Barakar town, on Bengals border with Jharkhand, unsafe and asking over 40,000 residents to leave.

 Some 270 km from Calcutta, Barakar is part of the 1,600- sq km Asansol coal belt, vast stretches of which face subsidence because of unscientific mining. 

 The entire Barakar and parts of Ranigunj, Jamuria, Dishergarh, Kenda and several other towns in the region are now under serious threat from abandoned mines. 

 But only Barakar residents have been put on notice because that is the only place under Bharat Coking Coal. Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) controls mines in the other areas.

 Having lived in Barakar for generations, the residents are crying foul. They have formed a Save Barakar Committee and declared a virtual war on Bharat Coking Coal.

 There is also an air of uncertainty. A similar notice was issued two years ago, but nothing happened beyond that.

 Roads were blocked in various parts of the town today to protest against the notice.

 Bharat Coking Coal said it was issued three weeks ago after the directorate general of mine safety and the Central Mining Planning Division said Barakar was unsafe for habitation. Staying in Barakar is the same as committing suicide. The town may collapse any moment, said A.K. Sengupta, the general manager of the Church Victoria mining area.

 We belong to Barakar. We are living here for 80 years. My father had a garments shop and I have added a jewellery shop to the family business. I invested Rs 2 lakh in the business recently. Why should we leave just because a notice has been served? asked Dinesh Jhunjhunwala, 55.

 Lawyer Debashish Bhattacharya, 40, and doctor Sudhanshu Bhowmick, 42, also have their own reasons for refusing to vacate the town. 

 Were ready to face any disaster. If the town goes down, let us, too, said Vaskar Lakhotia, a young utensils dealer. 

 The Save Barakar Committee has requested the company to fill the void underground with sand. Where will we go abandoning our business and a stable life? asked Giridharilal Agrawal, its president.

 After the nationalisation of mines, we didnt lift coal from the area as there was not much left. Earlier, the private companies dug out coal but didnt fill the void. It is impossible to stabilise the town with sand now, said Sushanta Banerjee, Bharat Coking Coals mining safety officer.

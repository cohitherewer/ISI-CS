 Close shave for train

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Baruipara (Hooghly), Feb 24: A Howrah-bound train had a close shave today when seven of its bogies ran over a crack on the track before it came to a halt.

 Residents of the area between Baruipara and Begampur stations, where the Agnibeena Express stopped, spotted the crack and alerted the driver by waving a red dupatta.

 The train stopped after seven of its bogies had chugged over the crack. 

 Railway officials, however, said the crack was a minor one a regular feature in winter mornings and there was no chance of a mishap.

 These cracks happen due to differences in temperature during winter, said A. K. Maitra, the Howrah divisional railway manager. It (the crack) was repaired immediately.

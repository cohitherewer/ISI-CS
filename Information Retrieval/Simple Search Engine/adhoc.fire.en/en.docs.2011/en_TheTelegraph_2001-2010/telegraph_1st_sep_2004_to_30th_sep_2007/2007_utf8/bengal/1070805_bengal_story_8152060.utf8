 Farakka scare

 Behrampore, Aug. 4: An alert was sounded at the Farakka power plant this evening after an employee spotted a contraption that looked like a bomb.

 CISF personnel cordoned off the object that had wires wrapped around a coconut oil can and found a gunny bag nearby. But neither they nor officers from Malda town, 40km away, could identify the object.

 A bomb squad from Calcutta has been summoned.

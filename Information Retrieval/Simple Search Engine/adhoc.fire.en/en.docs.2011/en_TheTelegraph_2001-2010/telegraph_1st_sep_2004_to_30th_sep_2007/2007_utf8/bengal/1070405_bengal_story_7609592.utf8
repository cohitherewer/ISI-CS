The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Singur GeNext forces plot selloff

 UTTAM DUTTA

 Singur, April 4: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees assertion th-at many farmers children in Bengal do not want to follow in their forefathers footsteps finds at least one example in Singur.

 A stones throw from the Tata Motors site, 45-year-old Liaqat Alis family has sold over five acres of multi-crop land to the government, which was looking for a plot to relocate a crematorium and a temple that were once on the land acquired for the small-car plant.

 Asma Begum, 40, was instrumental in persuading husband Liaqat and his elder brother Ansar Ali Mollah, 61, to sell the plot that they held jointly. 

 We decided to discontinue agriculture as our children were simply not interested, said Liaqat, a graduate who deals in potatoes.

 We knew the government was on the lookout for land and Asma kept telling me that it was time we gave up ours, said the resident of Beraberi.

 Liaqat and Asma have a son and a daughter. 

 Jasmina Sultana, 23, who got married to a businessman two years ago, stays at Haripal, also in Hooghly. Asif Ali, 15, who is in Class IX wants to work as an executive in a big company. 

 I want to do MBA and work in a reputable company, he said.

 Ansar was an English teacher in a high school in Kulpi, South 24-Parganas, until last year. He now draws a monthly pension.

 It was not very difficult to persuade him to sell the land. His elder son Amir, 23, is a fourth-year law student in Haldia and the younger, Ariz, is a classmate of cousin Asif at Beraberi High School.

 Ill graduate next year and practise law. My brothers will pursue their own careers, said Amir.

 Ariz wants a government job because it is secure. A farmer is always at the mercy of Nature.

 The cousins often go to Calcutta to shop and see films. It feels so different to see one at INOX, said Asif. They wear brands the boys prize their Lee jeans and love malls. 

 Only a few weeks ago, the chief minister told a peasants rally in Calcutta that Bengal had to be industrialised because educated children of farmers want jobs. 

 I knew what the children felt about the land and I also knew that there many others in our area who did not want to sell theirs because they were multi-crop, said Asma, a CPM member of the Beraberi panchayat.

 At Rs 8.8 lakh an acre, the five-acre land fetched Rs 44 lakh. The deal has been finalised and the land will be registered soon, said M.V. Rao, the director of industries.

 There were long discussions in the family before the deal was struck. We concluded that no one in the family wanted to be a tiller, said Liaqat.

 District magistrate Binod Kumar said the administration was grateful to the family. He knows that the absence of the crematorium and the temple could further fan the discontent over the industry drive.

 As the land war rages in pockets of Bengal, Ariz is pestering his father to buy him a computer.

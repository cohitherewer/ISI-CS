 Rape cloud on CPM

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 16: A CPM leader has been accused of taking advantage of a widows plight and raping her repeatedly. 

 Police said Arun Ghosh, 40, a party zonal committee member in South 24-Parganas Sonarpur, is absconding.

 The 40-year-old woman said Ghosh, a married man with two children, slept with her for several years promising marriage. She became pregnant a year ago but was forced into an abortion. He took me to a nursing home in Ballygunge and forced me to get the pregnancy aborted, she told the police.

 We are looking for him, the district police chief said.

 Ghosh owns several auto-rickshaws and is an influential man. He is also an executive member of a girls school.

 After the abortion, he promised the woman a flat and an auto for her 16-year-old son. When I pressured him for a commitment, his tone changed, she said.

 Ghosh and his associates have allegedly threatened to kill the mother and son. 

 Her husband, Asit Baran Ghosal, had died of a heart attack 10 years ago. Ghosh had then volunteered to help her out.

 Kajal De, the CPMs Sonarpur zonal committee secretary, said: The woman is trying to harass him. But his party bosses have ordered a probe.

 BRIEFS

 Santiniketan, Sept. 1: The CBI wants to close down the probe into the theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal. 

 The agency moved a Bolpur court last week seeking permission to end the case as no arrest or recovery has been made in three and a half years. Officials said the case may be reopened if the bureau gets some new information.

 Durgapur: Circus elephant Sabitri and the wild tusker with whom she eloped on Wednesday have crossed the Damodar and entered Bankura. Efforts to bring her back to captivity have proved futile.

 Howrah: Burdwan Medical College student Ajay Kar and his brother have been arrested in the JEE scam case. Ajay apparently did not appear in the entrance test.

 Durgapur: BC Roy Engineering College has suspended 26 final-year students for allegedly attacking their juniors.

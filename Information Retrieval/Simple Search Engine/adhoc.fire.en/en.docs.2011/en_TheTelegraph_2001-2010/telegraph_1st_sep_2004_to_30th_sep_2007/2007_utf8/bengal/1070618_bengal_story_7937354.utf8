 Malda, June 17: Mangoes need a new passport to travel to the US and Japan.

 The central horticultural commissioner has issued a notice asking all states not to export fruits to the two countries without germ-free certificates, landing Maldas mango exporters in a fix.

 Mangoes from Bengal can be exported to the UK and other European countries, but both Japan and the US have made it clear that they would not accept fruits that have not undergone germ eradication.

 The mango development officer of Malda, Samarendranath Khanra, said Bengals only eradication unit, run by a private company, is in Dankuni in south Bengal. 

 There are, however, several of them in Mumbai and cities in south India. 

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is considering a proposal to set up another plant in Dankuni or one in Basirhat in North 24- Parganas, Khanra said. 

 The fruits are cleaned by hot vapour in these plants to make them germ-free, Khanra said, adding that setting up a unit in Malda would cost Rs 4 crore.

 According to Khanra, Malda has a pack-house for exporting mangoes to foreign countries. The fruits are kept there at 40 degrees Celsius for four seconds to clean the surface. Then a grading machine does the screening before the mangoes are packed. 

 Khanra said the commissioner of the national horticulture mission, S.K. Roy, would visit Bengal on June 19 and talk to government officials and mango exporters here.

 Exporter Deepak Sarkar said they had known for a long time that foreign countries would lay down tough regulations on fruit imports from India.

 We had told the state government time and again to set up a germ eradication plant, but to no avail. Now we hear that the plant will be set up either in Dankuni or in Basirhat, both in south Bengal, Sarkar said, adding that more than 80 per cent of mangoes in Bengal are produced in Malda and Murshidabad in north Bengal.

 Sarkar said mango-growers in Malda district would demand that the plant be set up here. In the days to come, other European countries may also place curbs like the ones clamped by Japan and the US, he said.

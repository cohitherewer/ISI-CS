The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bloc turns Reliance away from doorstep

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, April 16: Reliance representatives who went to the state marketing board chief today to discuss the companys agri-retail plan were told to come with a fresh proposal as they had not made an appointment with him.

 The company had sought a licence for its business plan from the board and served a legal notice on it for allegedly sitting on it. 

 The Forward Bloc, whose leader Naren Chatterjee heads the board, is opposed to Reliances entry into the agri-retail business.

 Chatterjee told the Reliance team today to come with a fresh business proposal for any fruitful discussion. 

 He later said the officials came without an appointment. There is no harm in discussing a proposal. But we were not prepared for an impromptu meeting as it could help them in their legal moves.

 Reliance wants to procure farmers produce and trade them through its own chain of outlets.

 The board today examined the Agricultural Produce Marketing Control Act, 1972, to check whether such a licence can be issued. A private market set up by a corporate group is against the spirit and scope of the law meant to serve farmers and retailers interests, one of them said. 

 Reliances Bengal co-ordinator Kalyan Sarangi confirmed the visit to Chatterjee.

 Bloc state secretary Asoke Ghosh iterated his partys opposition to Reliance. We will not allow a domestic big business house to monopolise the agri-retail business. There will be no joint venture with Reliance or any corporate group.

 Reminded that the chief minister had told a meeting with Bloc leaders that Reliances way should not be blocked, Ghosh said: The law will have to be examined.

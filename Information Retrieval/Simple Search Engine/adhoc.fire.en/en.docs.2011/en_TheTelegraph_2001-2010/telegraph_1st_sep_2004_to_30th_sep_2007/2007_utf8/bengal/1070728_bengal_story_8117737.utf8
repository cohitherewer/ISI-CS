The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Court blow to HS council

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 27: The high court today turned down an appeal by the higher secondary council challenging an order to produce model answers to questions in this years examination.

 A division bench held that the high court trial judge had not erred in asking the council to produce model answers for evaluating the papers of three students who had challenged their marks.

 Ranajit Chatterjee, the lawyer for the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education, said the council had no problem placing model answers before the trial court, but it should presume the answers fixed by the council are correct and should not challenge them.

 A few days ago, Justice Biswanath Somadder had asked the HS council to produce the answer scripts of Madhurima Mukherjee and two other students of Asansol Girls Collegiate School. 

 It was also asked to place model answers in the physics, chemistry and math papers the subjects the three had failed to clear so that the judge could evaluate what the students had written.

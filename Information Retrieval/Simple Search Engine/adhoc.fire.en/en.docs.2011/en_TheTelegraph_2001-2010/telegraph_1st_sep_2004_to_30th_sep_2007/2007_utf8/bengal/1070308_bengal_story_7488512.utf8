The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Industry drive with agriculture paeans

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, March 7: After launching a string of industrial projects and professional institutes or laying foundation stones for them, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee highlighted Bengals great achievements in agriculture.

 We have to grow more paddy, wheat, fish and vegetables as agriculture is our main base, he added at a rally here, but only to bring into sharper focus the need for industry. 

 Although 65 per cent of our population depends on agriculture for a living, the new generation is not willing to go into cultivation, he said. 

 They are educated and want jobs. We have to set up industries for them. 

 Hours earlier, he opened an integrated steel plant at Gopalpur, which would provide employment to 2,000 people when fully operational, and the first phase of a renewable energy generating facility at Kamalpur on the fringes of Durgapur.

 The Gopalpur plant of Neo Metaliks Ltd has been set up at an investment of Rs 525 crore. Over Rs 150 crore was poured into the Kamalpur unit.

 Its the best of times; its the worst of times. Its the best of times because new frontiers of knowledge and technology have opened up, and worst of times because the benefits of these are often restricted to the developed rich nations of the world, Bhattacharjee said after opening the BC Roy College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Sciences.

 He also laid the foundation stone of a polytechnic college. New Horizons Institute of Technology will offer three-year diploma courses to at least 1,500 students in each batch.

 Suhatta, a multi-facility shopping mall, and Ginger, a business budget hotel built by the Tatas, were opened in the heart of the steel town now striving for a resurgence like the state itself.

 If at Gopalpur the chief minister said that the peoples verdict was in favour of industrialisation, at City centre he said: We cant oppose globalisation and it is welcome as long as it provides a level playing field to all countries.

 The detailed project report for a bypass at Panagarh is ready, Union road transport and highways minister T.R. Baalu has informed Asansol Durgapur Development Authority chairman and MP Bansogopal Chowdhury. Between the bypass and DVC Canal, 1,500 acres have been identified for an industrial cluster.

 Weve sought expressions of interest for a 30-acre IT park in Durgapur, he added.

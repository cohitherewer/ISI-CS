The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Citu pat for CMs industry drive

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 27: The Singur-Nandigram spectre that seems to be haunting the CPM is also affecting the partys labour arm, Citu, but the union is backing Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on industrialisation. 

 State and central Citu leaders, however, have differences on special economic zones and the entry of big Indian companies such as Reliance in retail when it comes to Bengal. 

 At the opening session of the Citu general council at Salt Lake Stadium, Citu president M.K. Pandhe urged the rank and file to prepare for a big fight against the UPA governments attack on labour rights. 

 But he lamented that other trade unions, even those run by the allies, are accusing Citu of doublespeak, citing Singur and Nandigram. I asked (CPI member of Parliament and Aituc leader) Gurudas Dasgupta whether our fight is against the Centre or the Bengal government, Pandhe said. We want industrialisation as a depleted army of labour cant fight for rights. Bengal needs industry, Mamata Banerjee doesnt want it, he added.

 The Nandigram-effect is apparent from the Citu general secretarys report, which explains over a page and a half that the slander campaign against (the) Bengal government following unfortunate happenings in Nandigram is aimed at blunting the Left opposition to the Centres policies. We must, however, patiently explain to common people what the government means to achieve, the report says.

 Pandhe is totally opposed to the jungle raj in the name of SEZs. State Citu president Shyamal Chakraborty, however, said: We are not opposed to SEZs as their concentration in some states would increase a regional imbalance. 

 The central Citu leadership is opposed to real estate business in SEZs, but Chakraborty stuck to the Bengal model, which leaves 25 per cent of a special zone for non-manufacturing industries. 

 In retail, Citu wants regulations to control the danger of desi corporate monopoly since foreign direct investment is trying to make a backdoor entry by joining hands with big players like Reliance. 

 There is no way to stop Indian companies retail foray legally, so they could well be allowed to do business after certain curbs are imposed, state Citu argued.

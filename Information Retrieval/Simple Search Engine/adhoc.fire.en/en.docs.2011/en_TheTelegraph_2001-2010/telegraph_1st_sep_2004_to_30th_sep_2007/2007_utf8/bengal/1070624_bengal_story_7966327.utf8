 BRIEFS

 Barasat, June 23: Mortaza Hossain, the minister for disaster management and agriculture marketing, was allegedly abused by a doctor at the Barasat district hospital tonight. 

 I went to visit Forward Bloc activist Sheikh Hannan Mollah, who had received a head injury, Hossain, a Bloc leader, said.

 He added that he found Mollah lying unattended although he had a problem in his urinary bladder. When I told the doctor, Samarendra Das, to treat him, he began to abuse me and told me that Mollah was all right, the minister, who is also a doctor, said. 

 Krishnagar: A 26-year-old man was murdered, allegedly by a neighbour, in Nadias Shantipur, about 70 km from here. Jagadish Halder, 40, stabbed Krittibash Halder who he thought was having an affair with his wife.

 Sankrail, July 3: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today had unlikely company at an investment event: a Trinamul Congress MLA.

 Sital Kumar Sardar, the MLA representing Howrahs Sankrail, is probably the first Trinamul leader to share a dais with the chief minister after the Opposition party began its Singur agitation. 

 The meeting was organised to mark the opening of a hydraulic plant by a German company. 

 Bhattacharjee noticed that Sardar was on the dais and immediately said: I am happy that the Assembly member from the Opposition is here. Turning to Sardar, seated in a corner, he added: I want to build a consensus on industry. 

 Sardar, however, echoed his leader Mamata Banerjee when his reaction was sought. You see, we are not against industry. Only, industries must come up on sites earmarked for them.

 The Rs 25-crore hydraulic plant will come up on less than an acre, about 30km from Calcutta, on NH-2. Its the first investment in India by Hunger Hydraulics, a medium-scale German company. The plant will be developed by the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation.

 The site is meant only for industry. They (the government) took the land sometime ago. I welcome the German company here, Sardar said, adding that the local people should get jobs.

 The Trinamul MLA didnt get to speak at the meeting, though.

 In Delhi, asked about Sardars presence at the event, Mamata said: I dont know the details of the incident. So I wont comment on it till I find out exactly what had happened.

 The Trinamul chief has taken her agitation against land acquisition to the capital after a deadlock in compensation talks.

 At the meeting, Bhattacharjee regretted that a consensus on industrialisation had eluded him.

 In Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, he said, the Opposition and the ruling parties stood united on industrialisation.

 When a project comes up, all parties reach a consensus. There will always be politics but not at the cost of development, Bhattacharjee said.

 Somen bats for Mamata

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 21: Ten years after Mamata Banerjee was expelled from the Congress, former state party chief Somen Mitra said it shouldnt have happened and held the high command responsible for the wrong move. 

 Mamata was an asset for the party and it was wrong to expel her. But I, being the then PCC president, had to make the announcement at the high commands behest, he told a Congress rally at Shahid Minar today.

 Mitra added that the party should tie up with Mamatas Trinamul Congress in its campaign against land acquisition for industry. The BJP is not part of Mamatas Krishi Jomi Raksha Committee. So whats the harm if we collaborate with her?

 In 1993, both Mitra and Mamata had contested for the state Congress presidents post, which the former won. 

 According to Mitra, the Congress has lost its credibility as far as the land acquisition campaign in the state is concerned. 

 We have really failed to step up the movement on burning issues like Singur and Nandigram. So, it is wise to tie up with Mamatas Krishi Jomi Raksha Committee to launch a broad-based movement against the communists.

 However, Congress leaders said Mitra, pushed to the corner, is desperate to regain the reins of the party. Todays rally is nothing but an effort to prove Somens strength, said a state Congress functionary.

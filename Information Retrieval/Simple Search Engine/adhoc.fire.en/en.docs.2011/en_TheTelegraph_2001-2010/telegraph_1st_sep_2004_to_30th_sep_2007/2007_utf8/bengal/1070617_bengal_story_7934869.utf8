 Cops take a beating

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Nandigram, June 16: The Nandigram mayhem has taken a toll on the men in khaki in more ways than one. 

 Forced to flee from the Bhangabera police camp yesterday after Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee (BUPC) supporters raided it, their morale is at an all-time low.

 Since the March 14 police firing that left 14 people dead and put the government on the backfoot, the police here say they have had their hands virtually tied behind their backs.

 Yesterday we were outnumbered, but even if that were not the case, the situation would not have been much different, said a sub-inspector of the state armed police who has been posted at Baharganj for the past three months. 

 We dont have too many weapons, and in any case after March 14, there is no question of firing. In this precarious situation, we are not sure when we will return to our families, he said.

 How can we save the lives of those living in refugee camps when we cannot save ourselves and had to run for cover? said a constable who was armed with a lathi when BUPC supporters went on the rampage in Ranichowk village yesterday. 

 He had only eight other policemen for company to beat back a nearly 100-strong mob.

 We are in a no-mans land and have been sent here to stand as a showpiece between the two warring groups, another constable complained.

 The East Midnapore superintendent of police, Anil Srinivas, refused to comment.

 There is also widespread resentment in the force against the government following yesterdays attack on two policemen in the Bhangabera camp. So much so, that some are planning to quit the force.

 We have been sent here to die, an officer said.

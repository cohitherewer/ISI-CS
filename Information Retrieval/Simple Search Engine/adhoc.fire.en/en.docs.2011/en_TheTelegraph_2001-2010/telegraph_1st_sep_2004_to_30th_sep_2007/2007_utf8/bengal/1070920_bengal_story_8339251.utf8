The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 HIV pariah at govt AIDS meet

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA 

 Calcutta, Sept. 19: An HIV positive man had his microphone snatched when he rose to speak at a Diamond Harbour AIDS workshop today.

 Khitish Mondal, a member of the Bengal Network for Pe-ople Living With HIV/AIDS, was stopped from speaking when he tried to put a question to a panel of officials from the states AIDS-control agency, the South 24-Parganas administration and NGOs. 

 The programme came to an abrupt end as I tried to ask them why the HIV positive people in the district werent invited, Mondal said.

 The West Bengal Legislators Forum on HIV/AIDS, a panel of 35 MLAs, had organised the workshop with the West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society. 

 The microphone was taken away, allegedly by some organisers, as Mondal, who had trooped in uninvited, began speaking during the Q amp;A round. Before that, he had watched the presentations from the last row of the conference room of a swank hotel that served as the venue.

 We have over 200 HIV positive patients in the district, but we were kept out of the loop, complained Mondal.

 Others at the conference were outraged, too. The organisers also snatched the microphone from me when I tried to protest against their indifference towards HIV positive people, said Satyaban Ranjit, director of NGO Chittaranjan Welfare and Research Centre. 

 The session was called off when the two came together to make their point that not involving patients bodies violated the rules on such government-funded initiatives.

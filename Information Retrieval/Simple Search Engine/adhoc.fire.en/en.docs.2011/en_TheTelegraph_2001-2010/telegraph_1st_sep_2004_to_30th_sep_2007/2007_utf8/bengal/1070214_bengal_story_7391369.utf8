The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Harvest help and horror

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Feb. 13: The end-winter rain will be a blessing for wheat, pulses and a host of summer vegetables but the opposite for potatoes and cold-weather delights like cauliflowers, cabbages and tomatoes. 

 Officials said the rain has provided much-needed irrigation to standing winter crops like wheat, corn and pulses. 

 Wheat is being grown on over 400,000 hectares.

 The rain is also good for early-summer crops like ladys fingers, mangoes and wax gourds, where the fruit has app- eared and is almost ready for harvest. For those in the flow-ering stage now, persistent rain may prove a spoiler, agriculture director D. Konar said.

 The rain will only encourage more pests in vegetables like gourd and pumpkin and in mangoes.

 The wet weather is also likely to aggravate the blight, a disease in potatoes, which was detected in December.

 We are telling farmers to apply to us for crop insurance in case they fear that it might fail, said Konar. Last year, the state and the Centre had together given Rs 18 crore as potato insurance.

 However, the total production may not be affected as around 400,000 hectares have been brought under cultivation. Last year, potato was grown on around 3.15 lakh hectares.

 Met officials said the rain might continue.

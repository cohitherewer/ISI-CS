Darjeeling, Sept. 18: Say hello to Indian Idol and bye to a drink in the evening.

 The Darjeeling administration has ordered all foreign liquor off shops and country spirit shops in the hills shut after 5pm over the weekend and on Monday. 

 The fear: frenzied celebrations or mourning, depending on how Prashant Tamang fares in the final round of the talent hunt show. 

 The winner will be declared at 9pm on Sunday after over a weeks voting. 

 Frenzy and Prashant fans go hand in hand. They have spent crores buying mobile recharge cards to SMS their votes or sponsored booths for others to vote through landlines. They have also laid siege to service providers offices, accusing them of not delivering the votes to the Sony TV server.

 In Kalimpong, leaflets today ordered Lepcha groups on hunger strike against hydel power projects in North Sikkim to concentrate on voting for Prashant instead.

 The Prashant Fan Club in Darjeeling had recently requested the district magistrate to crack down on watering holes in town.

 Prashant, from Darjeeling, is a police constable in Calcutta.

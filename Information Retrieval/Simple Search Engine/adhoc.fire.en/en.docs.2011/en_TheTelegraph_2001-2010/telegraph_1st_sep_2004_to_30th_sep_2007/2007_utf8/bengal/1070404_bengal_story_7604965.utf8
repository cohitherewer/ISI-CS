 Rs 16-crore relief for tea

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Jalpaiguri, April 3: Finance minister Asim Dasgupta today declared a special grant of Rs 16 crore for the closed tea gardens of the Dooars, where many have almost been starving for years. 

 After a tour of some of the 13 gardens that are closed and making a slew of promi-ses (see box), the minister said: Weve attempted to ex-tend all possible assistance to workers and will make an all-out effort to reopen the gardens in the next three months. 

 Investors who take over or reopen a gardenwill not have to pay a cess. 

 The value-added tax and central sales tax have been waived on tea sold from the Jalpaiguri action centre for two years from April 1.

 The Rs 16 crore that Dasgupta promised is for the next three months only. Well sit for a review after that and, in case there is no breakthrough, another allotment would be announced, he said. 

 Over 2,000 workers have died in the Dooars in the past five years, unable to cope with poverty. Their plight had prompted governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi to visit one of the estates about a month ago.

 The minister, however, refused to admit that there have been starvation deaths in the gardens. We have no such news. Some people have died of diseases, unable to get treat- ment because of lack of funds, he said. 

 Dasgupta promised action against planters who have fled the estates after running up crores in provident fund dues. Weve asked the superintendent of police to crosscheck whether complaints have been registered against such owners, he said. We will then take up the issue with the PF department and will consult senior lawyers on what action might be taken. 

 Doctors would be recruited on contract in all the closed gardens and all the families living in them will be given free ration benefits that garden management used to ensure them earlier. 

 At Redbank tea estate at Banarhat, around 70 km from here, he spoke to workers for an hour on development schemes and alternative means of livelihood. 

 We are ready to supply seeds, saplings and fertiliser free of cost. You should start agriculture on unused garden land, he told Gopal Sarki, Santi Khesh, Rekha Brahmin and Mantu Sarkar. 

 The government has also decided to create more jobs under the 100-day-work scheme in estates by including tasks like pruning of tea bushes. 

 The three tea estates where we have cancelled the lease are government property now. Any work done there would be considered public work. In the other gardens, we feel there are ways to create more employment opportunities and to include them in the 100-day-work scheme, Dasgupta said.

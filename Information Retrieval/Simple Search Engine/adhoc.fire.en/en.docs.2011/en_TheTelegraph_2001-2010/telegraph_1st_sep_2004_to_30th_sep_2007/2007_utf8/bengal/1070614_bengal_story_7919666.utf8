 June 13: An eight-month-old baby died of heart failure this morning as thunder raged outside his house in Kalyani. 

 Manoj Dutta could not bear the sound of the thunder and lightning and had a heart failure, said Nirupam Biswas, the superintendent of Kalyani Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital, where the child had been taken.

 Tragic tales poured through the day as the first spell of monsoon struck south Bengal hard.

 Shampa Mondal, 13, had run out of her home when the first raindrops fell a welcome relief after the sweltering heat. But it turned out to be her last dance in the rain. The Class V student from Digol village in Haringhata died after she was struck by lightning. 

 Saiful Mian, 36, from the same village was hit by a bolt when he went out of his house to relieve himself.

 The heavy rain accompanied by a storm claimed eight lives in Nadia, East Midnapore, Howrah and Burdwan districts this morning. 

 The thunderstorm that hit Calcutta and its neighbouring districts around 7 am also killed domestic animals, uprooted trees and damaged houses and crops.

 Three ponies died in Elanagar village in Nadias Chapra, 130 km from Calcutta, after lightning struck a tin shed under which they were standing. Mushar Ali had bought the ponies only seven months ago for Rs 70,000.

 Nadia district magistrate Onkar Singh Meena said he had asked all block development officers to prepare reports on the extent of damage caused by the downpour.

 The district administration will arrange compensation for the affected families after receiving the report, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Trinamul not sorry for House horror

 ANINDYA SENGUPTA

 Calcutta, April 24: The 19 Trinamul Congress legislators pulled up for ransacking the Assembly have not expressed any repentance in their written submission to the privilege committee.

 As responsible members of the House, we have (the) highest esteem for it and confirm that there is no question of doing anything that can lower its dignity, the vandals said in letter to the committee.

 Privilege motions had been moved against the MLAs for the November 30 mayhem in which furniture were smashed and microphones yanked off consoles because party chief Mamata Banerjee had not been allowed to go to Singur, where prohibitory orders were in place. 

 The Speaker, who had withheld 29 Trinamul MLAs salary and perks from December, however, cleared them even before they responded to the privilege motion. His April 2 ruling says: Salaries and allowances of Trinamul MLAs, kept in abeyance since December 4, 2006, may be released immediately. Damages worth Rs 3,97,404 shall be realised from 29 Trinamul MLAs who were present in the House on November 30.

 The dues will be paid to them with retrospective effect from December after Rs 13,704 is deducted from each of the 29 as damages.

 Asked why the party did not apologise, leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee said: Our MLAs were emotionally charged and the incident was the outcome of the police attack on our leader.

 An MLA said the party decided against accepting responsibility for the incident as that would have allowed the privilege committee to recommend action against us. 

 Why should they apologise? Breaking chairs and tables is nothing compared to the police firing in Nandigram, said Mamata.

 Inquiry into death of ticketless traveller

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 2: The 

 railways today ordered an inquiry into an incident yesterday 

 in which a youth travelling without ticket was thrown out 

 of a running train by ticket examiners. 

 We have ordered a departmental probe. The Katwa GRP (Government Railway Police) have started a case against the six TTEs (travelling ticket examiners), Katwa station manager Pranab Bhattacharya said today. 

 Police said Suraj Pande, 24, of Kinnahar in Birbhum was on the Katwa-bound lo- cal train that left Bandel at 2.30pm. He was to take bus home from Katwa, where the train would have reached around two-and-a-half hours later.

 The ticket checkers led by P.B. Samanta had raided Surajs compartment. When he failed to produce a ticket, the TTE team fined him Rs 200. But he had only Rs 40 on him, said Abhijit Bhattacharya, the railway police officer-in-charge in Katwa.

 Suraj handed over all the money he had, but the checkers wanted more. Other passengers raised their voice as they felt the young man was being fleeced. This led to an altercation during which he was flung off the train, the officer-in-charge said.

 Another train chopped off Surojs legs. He died at the Katwa subdivisional hospital last night.

 Brother Parimal said Suraj was the youngest of five siblings. He got a job in a Calcutta NGO two months ago.

 Suraj fell when the train was about to enter Katwa station, about 160km from Calcutta. Jairam Bairagya, who was in the compartment, managed to catch hold of one of the TTEs, who tried to flee as the train stopped. 

 Jogendranath Mandi was thrashed and handed over to the police. 

 Bairagya lodged the police complaint against the ticket checkers, all of whom but Mandi are absconding. Mandi has been remanded in three days jail custody.

 We have started a case against all six. Surajs elder brother Parimal has also filed a complaint. We are looking for the five others P.B. Samanta, Asraf Mollah, Akhil Kumar Majumdar, Anil Biswas and Tapan Kumar Ghosh, railway police officer Bhattacharya said.

 When Mandi was produced in the additional sessions judges court, a mob outside screamed that he should be hanged.

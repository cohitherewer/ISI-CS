The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Industry pitch

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Haroa, Feb. 14: There is no alternative to industrialisation, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee iterated at a programme in a backward pocket of North 24-Parganas today. 

 If a state has to advance, it must welcome industry. There are nearly 1.35 crore acres of agricultural land in Bengal. There will be no problem even if we take 1 lakh acres for industry, he said, inaugurating a festival, 50 km from Calcutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Land role fails to satisfy state

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 31: The government is not happy being allowed only a measure of control in land procurement for special economic zones (SEZs).

 The Centre announced yesterday that a state would be empowered to acquire only 30 per cent of the land for an SEZ.

 In a place like Bengal, where land holdings are fragmented, getting contiguous plots will be almost impossible unless the government acquires the land, land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said. Small farmers would get a raw deal if the state stays away, he added. 

 The government wants its own safeguards for farmers. Prospective SEZ developers are being made to promise adequate compensation for landlosers and sharecroppers, an official said. The government will also ensure that no SEZ is planned on irrigated land.

 Investors could earlier buy all the land they required.

 Bengal had written to Delhi seeking control over acquisition and arguing that farmers were likely to be cheated if they entered into private deals.

 MP punished for poll loss

 RABI BANERJEE

 Krishnagar, June 24: The Nadia CPM has removed a Rajya Sabha MP from a zonal committee after a probe into why the party lost Nakashipara for the second time in a row in the Assembly elections.

 The probe report had pointed to infighting fuelled by Rajya Sabha member Kabiruddin Ahmed. 

 Former MLA Santosh Singha has also been removed from the zonal committee and half-a-dozen party workers, associated with branch and local committees, have been either dropped or warned.

 S.M. Sadi, the candidate in the 2006 polls, lost the seat to the Trinamul Congresss Kollol Khan by 500 votes. In 2001, Khan had defeated Singha. 

 Immediately after the polls, the CPM formed a five-member panel to inquire into the reasons behind the defeat. It was headed by Ashok Banerjee, a senior district secretariat member. 

 Last month, Banerjee submitted the report to the district committee recommending stern action against those involved in sabotaging the party candidates electoral prospects. 

 We have taken stern disciplinary action against all those having a role in the party candidates defeat, said Sumit De, a district secretariat member who was assigned to oversee the 2006 Assembly polls in the district.

 Instead of doing their assigned jobs during the polls, those facing disciplinary action had fanned infighting.

 Sadi, who lost the seat, refused to comment. 

 Asked about the disciplinary action against him, Ahmed flared up. Am I supposed to tell you about the partys internal matters? Ask the district leadership, he said over his cellphone.

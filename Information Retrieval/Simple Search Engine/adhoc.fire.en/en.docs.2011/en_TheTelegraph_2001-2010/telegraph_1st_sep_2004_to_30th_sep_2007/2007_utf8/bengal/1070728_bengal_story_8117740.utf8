The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Painless power tariff hike to prick AC houses more

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 27: The power watchdog has approved new tariffs but most domestic consumers of CESC can breathe easy.

 For households that consume less than 300 units a month, the changes are marginal. At the most, they will end up paying Rs 5 more a month. The rates will have retrospective effect from April 1.

 Those who use more than 300 units will have to cough up more. If your monthly consumption is 400 units, you will have to pay Rs 9 extra. The rate for each unit above the first 300 has been increased by four paise.

 Of our total 17-18 lakh domestic customers, between 70,000 and 80,000 consume more than 300 units a month. They will have to pay a little more than before, a CESC official said. 

 The estimate is based on last years data and need not fully reflect the explosion in the number of air-conditioners in the city since this summer. Most houses with ACs usually cross the 300-unit mark.

 According to the new rates approved by the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission for the private power utility, the charges have been kept unchanged for the domestic consumption of the first 100 units (kilo-watt hour). If you are consuming 90 units a month, you will pay Rs 250.05 as before. 

 The monthly consumption of about 10 lakh consumers is less than 100 units a month. They will be paying the same monthly electricity bill as before, the CESC official said.

 However, the rate for the next 50 units (after the first 100 units) has been raised by one paisa to Rs 4.33 per kilo-watt hour. This will translate into a 50 paise rise in the gross monthly bill of domestic customers consuming 150 units of electricity every month, an official of the commission said.

 If you are consuming between 150 units and 300 units a month, the bill will go up by Rs 5. The rate for the next 150 units (after the first 150 units) has been increased to Rs 4.50 from Rs 4.47 per unit. 

 CESC had asked for an average tariff of 396.37 paise per unit, but the regulator approved 375.72 paise. The utilitys average tariff last financial year was 374.40 paise per unit.

 Small shops consuming up to 150 units a month get a respite. The rate is increased by one paisa a unit above 150 units and up to 300 units. Above 300 units, the rate will be three paise a unit. 

 The regulator has created new categories in the form of cottage industry, artisans, weavers and small production units and poultry, food processing units and others. It has reduced the rates for them significantly. 

 The tariff for industrial consumers who have been using low-voltage lines has also been reduced.

 However, the regulator has classified the high and extra-high voltage consumers (industrial) into two groups those using below 33 kv lines and those using above it. 

 It has also introduced seasonal tariffs. High-user industries will have to pay different rates during the summer, the monsoon and the winter.

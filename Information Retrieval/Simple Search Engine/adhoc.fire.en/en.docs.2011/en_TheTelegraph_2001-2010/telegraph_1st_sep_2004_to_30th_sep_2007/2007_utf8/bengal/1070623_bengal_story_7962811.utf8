The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Job cry from Tata trainees

 OUR BUREAU

 Bandel/Howrah, June 22: More than 200 students of the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) in Howrah and Hooghly districts today boycotted classes demanding a definite assurance of jobs to land losers in the Singur Tata Motors project.

 At the Ramrajatala ITI in Howrah, about 187 students staged a demonstration.

 Yesterday, the students had submitted a memorandum to the institutes acting principal, Soumen Basu, who forwarded it to Howrah district magistrate Khalil Ahmed.

 Gautam Polen, one of the protesting students, said the government had promised them jobs at the Tata Motors ancillary units. But it has gone back on its promise. We will flatten the boundary wall of the factory if denied jobs. 

 Abhijeet Das, training as an electrician at the Bandel ITI, said confusion had led to the unrest. We have heard that only those who get 90 per cent and above will be given jobs. We are confused and so we have decided to protest.

 Director of industries M.V. Rao clarified that 90 per cent attendance, and not marks, is a must. 

 In Delhi, a Tata spokesperson said: If they successfully clear the training and related tests, they will become eligible for employment.

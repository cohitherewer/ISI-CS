The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 8 yrs on, job in 8 weeks

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 7: The high court today asked the School Service Commission to give within eight weeks a teachers job to a man who had been waiting eight years for it.

 Tanmoy Kumar Mishras name had figured in the second place on a list drawn up by the commission in 1999 to fill two vacant zoology teacher posts in madarsas of the western region. But the resident of Contai in East Midnapore didnt get a call.

 When the commission published newspaper ads in 2001, seeking fresh applications for appointment in schools in the western region, Mishra moved the high court. 

 The petitioner (Mishra) will have to given appointment first. Then the SSC will fill up 40 other vacant posts in schools of the western region, Justice B. Somadder said today.

 On the commissions map, East and West Midnapore, Burdwan, Bankura and Birbhum form the western region.

 On December 18, 2001, Justice Barin Ghosh had asked the commission to give jobs to Mishra and the candidate who stood first before appointing others. The order was not followed. The commission told the court there was no vacancy for zoology teachers.

 However, in 2006, it again sought applications for 41 vacant posts in schools, including those for science teachers.

 Mishra knocked the court doors again, pointing out the commissions doublespeak.

 Justice Somadder today asked the commissions lawyer why the earlier high court order was not followed. The lawyer said Mishra could not be given a job as there was no vacant post in madarsas. 

 When the commission said in 1999 that it was looking for madarsa teachers, Mishra opted for a madarsa instead of a school for obvious reasons. 

 The judge wanted to know the fate of the man who stood first in 1999. Ashoke Dey, the lawyer for Mishra, said: He had moved a separate petition before the high court and got an order in his favour. He has got a job.

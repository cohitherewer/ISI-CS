 Nine years to file an appeal

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 7: The government was fined by the high court today for taking nine years to move an appeal against a state administrative tribunal order.

 Not much in terms of money, but the Rs 22,000 fine was yet another blow to the government four days after four senior officials were sentenced to jail for contempt. 

 Today, the court allowed the appeal against the tribunals order to appoint all 162 empanelled candidates as veterinary assistants but added that it would have to be followed if the fine isnt paid in 14 days. 

 In 1998, the animal husbandry department had decided to fill 49 veterinary assistant posts in Murshidabad. It took a test and made a panel of 162 candidates. After the 49 were picked, 22 others alleged that only those close to the minister and his party had bagged jobs. The tribunal allowed the petition and asked the government to appoint all 162 who were empanelled. The state neither carried out the order nor appealed against it until this year. 

 Counsel Subrata Mukhopadhyay told the division bench of Justices B. Bhattacharya and K.K. Prasad that the tribunals order was bad in law. 

 It accepted the argument and said: The government is not bound to appoint all candidates whose names are empanelled for a job. The state has the right to make a fresh panel for further appointments.

 But it did not spare the state. It has harassed the petitioners and will have to pay an exemplary fine for its mistake, the court said.

 The government will have to pay Rs 22,000 (Rs 1,000 to each petitioner) within a fortnight, failing which it will have to carry out the SAT order.

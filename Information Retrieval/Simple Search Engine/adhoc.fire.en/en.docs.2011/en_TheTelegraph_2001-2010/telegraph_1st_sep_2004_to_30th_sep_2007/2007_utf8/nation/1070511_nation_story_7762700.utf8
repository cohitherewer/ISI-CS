 CBI to probe newspaper rampage

 M.R. VENKATESH 

 Karunanidhi

 Chennai, May 10: The blood-splattered succession row in M. Karunanidhis family has prompted the chief minister to order a CBI probe.

 Following an opinion poll that put Karunanidhis younger son M.K. Stalin ahead in the DMK succession race, a mob claiming allegiance to his other son M.K. Azhagiri had firebombed the Dinakaran office in Madurai yesterday. Three of the newspapers employees were killed. 

 Replying to a special mention by Opposition parties in the Assembly this morning, Karunanidhi said he opted for the CBI, instead of Tamil Nadu police, as my own family members have been dragged into these incidents.

 The protesters had also targeted the Madurai offices of Dinakarans sister publication Tamil Murasu and Sun TV, which is part of the media network headed by Kalanidhi Maran, brother of Union IT minister Dayanidhi Maran and Karunanidhis grandnephew.

 Azhagiri today sent a legal notice to Kalanidhi for broadcasting derogatory and defamatory reports against him. 

 In its police complaint, the Dinakaran management has said Azhagiri was responsible for the attack.

 The survey storm seems to have blown the lid off the growing gulf between Karunanidhis family and the Marans.

 The chief minister today argued that the opinion poll, published by Dinakaran, was uncalled for. He said when the promos were being run, he had suggested to the newspaper not to publish the findings as it can needlessly raise controversies. But the newspaper management disregarded my advice.

 Karunanidhi said neither Azhagiri nor his poet-daughter Kanimozhi has ever aspired to a post in the party or the government. 

 Dropping hints that the attack could have been politically motivated, DMK sources said the CBI probe is a masterstroke that could put the Marans in a spot. 

 Karunanidhi today played the responsible chief minister to the hilt. Although groupism is common in any party, the moment I heard that Azhagiris supporters had reacted to the survey with anger and set fire to the newspaper office, I ordered the police to take immediate action, he said. 

 The police have arrested 75 people for yesterdays violence, including seven who were held for the raid on the newspapers office and the killings. But Attack Pandi, the man who allegedly led the mob into the office, is still at large.

 All the arrests till this evening had been made on the basis of three complaints registered by the police.

 Karunanidhi today assured the Assembly that the complaint by Muthu Pandiyan, the news editor of Dinakaran, would be tagged to the police FIRs. 

 But journalists alleged that the police were deliberately ignoring Pandiyans complaint. This seems to be an attempt to sidetrack the real FIR, in which Azhagiri has been cited as the first accused for all the violence let loose yesterday, journalist N. Ram said this evening.

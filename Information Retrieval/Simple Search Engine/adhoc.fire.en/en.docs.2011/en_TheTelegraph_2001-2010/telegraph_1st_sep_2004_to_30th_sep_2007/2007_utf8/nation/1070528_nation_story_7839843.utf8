 Bollywood backdrop to catch tourist troupes 

 - New UK itinerary for Indians

 A still from Namastey London

 Hordes of brightly dressed Indian dancers should soon be leading troupes of tourists to Britains famous and not-so-famous landmarks.

 With Indians spending more than the Japanese for the first time last year, tourist body VisitBritain has drawn up a sometimes unlikely map featuring dozens of British locations used by directors in 30 Bollywood hits. Among the less well-known attractions are an obscure Surrey football ground and a Slough shopping centre.

 Molesey FC featured in scenes from the British-made Bend It Like Beckham, the story of a daughter of orthodox Sikhs battling to realise her footballing dreams, while Sloughs Queensmere provided the backdrop for the 2001 Bollywood movie Yaadein.

 Other unusual attractions on the map include the Bicester village shopping centre in Oxfordshire, which featured in the 2001 film Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, and Dolbadarn Castle in north Wales, used in Kyun! Ho Gaya Na in 1998.

 More traditional tourist attractions, including Windsor Castle, Trafalgar Square, Tower bridge and Princes Street in Edinburgh, also feature.

 The tourism body will launch the map this week ahead of the Bollywood Oscars ceremony being held next month in Sheffield.

 Some 23 million Indians go to see a film every day and you only have to look at the figures to see that more and more of them are being inspired to visit Britain, said Tom Wright, the chief executive of VisitBritain.

 Britains popularity as a Bollywood backdrop can only help us raise our profile among this growing audience.

 Although the average Indian earns only about 300 each year, the fast-growing middle class numbering about 50 million has an average annual disposable income of 12,000. By 2025, it is predicted that 41 per cent of the population about 83 million people will be from the middle class. The number visiting the UK rose by 25 per cent last year, spending 294 million.

 Several of the films on the map feature Shah Rukh Khan. He is supporting VisitBritains initiative. I have always loved filming in Britain and hope to do more shoots here in the future, said Khan.

 Some movies like Namastey London were filmed almost entirely in Britain because sequences shot overseas are particularly attractive to Indian cinemagoers.

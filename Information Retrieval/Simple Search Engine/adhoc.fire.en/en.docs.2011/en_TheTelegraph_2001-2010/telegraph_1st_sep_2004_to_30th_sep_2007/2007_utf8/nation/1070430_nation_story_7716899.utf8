 One-time relief not a rule: SC

 New Delhi, April 29 (PTI): An order passed by a court as a concession or one-time relief cannot become a law by itself, the Supreme Court has ruled.

 Such a concession would not have any binding effect and cannot be cited as a precedent by others, it said while quashing a Calcutta High Court order on appointment of 55 trained teachers in government schools.

 The high court had ordered the appointment of petitioner Sristidhar Biswas and the 54 others. Biswas, in his petition, had cited the precedent of two other batches of candidates appointed on the directive of the court. 

 The two batches were appointed in 1989 as teachers by the government on the high courts directive.

 At the time of giving relief to the first batch of candidates in the Sirazul Haque Mallick and Others case, the high court had said the directive was being given as a one-time concession and should not be cited as a precedent.

 Despite this directive, another bench had ordered the appointment of 88 teachers on a petition filed by Dibakar Pal, who cited the appointment of Mallick and the others. 

 Thereafter, Biswas and the 54 others moved the high court, seeking their appointment by citing the precedent set in the Mallick and Pal cases.

 The high court had ordered the appointment of Biswas and the others, following which the Nadia district primary school council filed an appeal in the Supreme Court.

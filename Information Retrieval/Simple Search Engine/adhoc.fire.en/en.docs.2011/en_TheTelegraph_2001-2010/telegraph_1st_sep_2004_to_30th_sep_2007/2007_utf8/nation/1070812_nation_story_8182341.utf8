 Racing bus crushes childs leg

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 11: A two-and-a-half-year-old girl had her left leg crushed by the wheels of a bus as it raced another today.

 Khusi Sardar was crossing the Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road near the Khanna intersection around 10.35am, holding on to an elderly neighbour, when the bus swerved towards them at high speed, eyewitnesses said.

 Khusi lost her balance and fell, her left leg going under one of the wheels. Doctors at R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital were struggling to save the leg tonight. The girls father Deepak is a cloth trader.

 The route 202 bus was travelling north towards Shyambazar. Some eyewitnesses said it was trying desperately to stay ahead of another bus on the same route that was chasing it from behind, an officer said at Burtolla police station.

 He added: The Sardar family has members living on both sides of APC Road, and Khusi was probably going to a relatives home when the accident at Nandanbagan took place.

 The driver managed to escape. The police have started a case of rash and negligent driving.

 We have brought the vehicle to the police station and have launched a hunt for the driver, the officer said.

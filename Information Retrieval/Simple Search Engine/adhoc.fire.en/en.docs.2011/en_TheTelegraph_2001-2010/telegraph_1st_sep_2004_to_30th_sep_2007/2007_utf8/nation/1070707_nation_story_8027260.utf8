 Locust threat looms on India

 New Delhi, July 6: The swarm of locusts that heads to India this season could spell bigger trouble than usual because of particularly favourable conditions for breeding this year, the UN has warned.

 Standard levels of response to the locust threat may not be sufficient to prevent the outbreak of a plague, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the UN has told India and Pakistan. 

 Locusts from Africa and West Asia visit Rajasthan and Gujarat and neighbouring areas of Pakistan as part of their annual migratory cycle. 

 Humidity in the region has shot up because of heavy monsoon showers in Gujarat and Sindh, and locusts need warm temperatures and rainfall to breed. 

 We fear the locusts will take advantage of these conditions to multiply more than can be controlled, FAO entomologist Keith Crassman told The Telegraph over telephone from Rome. 

 Gujarat officials are closely monitoring the new danger likely to hit grasslands in Kutch, Banaskantha, Patan, Porbander, Rajkot and Jamnagar. 

 The epidemic may require emergency aerial spraying, an official said. 

 The officials have claimed that locusts have invaded three villages in Gujarat this year, but Crassman said the Indian government has not reported it to the FAO yet. 

 Locusts, Crassman explained, feed on all crops but do not harm human beings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Boys, watch out for Boss

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, June 30: Bushs boys will be boys and will just want to have fun, Karat or no Karat.

 And the crew of USS Nimitz may be willing to burn the equivalent of Rs 6 crore for that and a bit of The Boss.

 Come Monday, the city will see its largest single-day invasion by foreign tourists in living memory when the nuclear-powered US aircraft carrier disgorges 5,000 sailors and 450 officers.

 Around 20 of the best hotels are booked full. Emporium managers and garment sellers would be grinning instead of worrying about the sovereignty and environment issues the Left has raised.

 Sources said that going by their past record at ports of call, the crew are expected to splurge $1.5 million at Rs 1.5 crore a day before they leave on Thursday.

 They have been out on sea for months, an Indian Navy source explained.

 What might whet the Americans appetite is a one-day delay they were originally scheduled to dock tomorrow.

 The bolder might straightaway look up Rajnikanth in Sivaji-The Boss, perhaps on the recommendations of US consul-general David T. Hopper who attended the first-day screening at Sathyam cinema.

 Those of a more romantic bent are likely to make a quick trip to Agra for a glimpse of the Taj, the sources said.

 The itinerary is being kept a secret for reasons of security as well as to skirt possible protests. But sources let on that the sight-seeing list includes Mamallapuram, the ancient Pallava port; Kancheepuram, famed for its temples and silk saris; and Kuttanad, the rice bowl of Kerala.

 Cultural programmes, such as classical dance shows, are being organised at the Taj Coromandel and Chola Sheraton to give the visitors the mandatory insight into Indian culture. Its unclear if they would have preferred discos.

 But a key element of fun which in the old days would never be complete without checking out the brothels is definitely out, especially with terror and local sensitivities ever ready to play spoilsport.

 Instead, some social service is lined up. Trips have been arranged to orphanages and old-age homes, where the Americans are expected to cheer the inmates up and even make small donations.

 The Indian navy will host a dinner for its guests on July 3, a day after the Americans throw one for the Indians on board the Nimitz.

 The carrier will anchor two nautical miles off the Chennai harbour breakwater at 6 am. It will be accompanied by the USS Pinckney, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, instead of the USS Princeton as scheduled.

 Prakash Karat will be happy to know that the need for hospitality hasnt blinded Delhi towards its duties.

 The radiation hazards from the aircraft carrier, which has two nuclear power reactors, will be checked continuously at three places, including one near the ship. Two floating labs will also stay close to the Nimitz to monitor air and water samples.

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Feb. 26: Lalu Prasad today gifted his home state two factories a wagon unit at Dalmianagar in Rohtas and an electric locomotive works in his constituency, Madhepura.

 The railway minister plans to set up the locomotive factory at a cost of Rs 1,300 crore in Madhepura, a few hours ride from Chittaranjan Locomotive Works in Bengal. 

 An industrial complex will come up in Dalmianagar near Bihars border with Uttar Pradesh. 

 The two projects are expected to create a large number of jobs and bring a dose of prosperity to these impoverished parts of the railway ministers state.

 Among the beneficiaries of the budget in Bihar are some of Lalu Prasads most loyal supporters milkmen and vegetable vendors. 

 The minister has announced special vendor coaches for them on all routes. So, they no longer have to hang their huge milk cans and vegetable baskets from the widows of train compartments. 

 Bihar has also got five new trains, including an air-conditioned garib rath.

 Neighbour Uttar Pradesh, hasnt done badly either. As many as nine trains will be introduced in the state going to polls in April 7. Lalu Prasad had some time ago announced a railway coach factory in Rae Bareli, the political borough of UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and son Rahul. 

 NCPs Sharad Pawar should also be happy with seven new trains for Maharashtra, including one for his constituency Baramati. The railway minister also announced Rs 5,000 crore for the Mumbai suburban transport system.

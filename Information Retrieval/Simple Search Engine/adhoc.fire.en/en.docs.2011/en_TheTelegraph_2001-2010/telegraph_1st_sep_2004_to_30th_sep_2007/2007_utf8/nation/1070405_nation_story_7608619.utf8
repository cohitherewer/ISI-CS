 Zee firm on cricket league

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, April 4: Subhas Chandras Zee has said it would like the cooperation of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for its cricket league, but left little doubt the plan would go ahead even if the board didnt play along.

 We expect the BCCI to be cooperative. If not, it doesnt affect us much. Unlike what some BCCI officials have been claiming, we dont need their permission to use local sports facilities and infrastructure, said a top Zee official.

 The Sports Authority of India and other government bodies own most cricket grounds, while state associations provide infrastructure, he said. The BCCI has no direct role. 

 Players, he said, are contracted by local boards. Scouting for fresh talent and enlisting them shouldnt be a problem. We were surprised to receive calls from many senior players yesterday (offering help for the plan).

 The official claimed Chandras Essel group, which is promoting the Indian Cricket League, is in talks with Brian Lara, Justin Langer and Michael Slater, besides Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne, who have been sounded out. 

 The BCCIs response was guarded. Yesterday, its vice-president, Lalit Modi, tried to play down the possibility of a direct threat from Chandras league. Officials had insisted Zee would need the boards nod to use sports facilities. 

 Secretary Niranjan Shah said Chandras plan will be discussed on April 6 and 7. The issue was not part of the board agenda earlier, sources said, adding Indias performance at the World Cup is to be the main point of discussion. 

 But now, there will be more. With Chandra springing a surprise and writing to the board for cooperation, the board members will be under pressure, the source said.

 Zee Telefilms had quoted the highest sum for telecast rights in 2004, but its bid was rejected by the earlier BCCI regime. 

 Chandra has denied suggestions hes itching for a duel with the BCCI, but sources say the mood in the Essel group is in favour of going ahead with the league at any cost.

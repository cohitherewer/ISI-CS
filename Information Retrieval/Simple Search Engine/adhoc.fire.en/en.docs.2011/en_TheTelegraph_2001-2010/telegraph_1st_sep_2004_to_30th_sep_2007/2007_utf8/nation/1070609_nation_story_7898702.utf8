 Manuals to provide stress tips for soldiers

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, June 8: Army officers have been given pocket-sized manuals that contain advisories on how to reduce stress among troops and check soldier suicides and incidents of fratricide.

 The manuals, prepared by the Defence Institute of Psychological Research after a study, will be a must-carry for officers in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast.

 Since 2004, more than 400 soldiers have committed suicide. Of these, 327 were from the army, 64 from the air force, and 13 from the navy and the Coast Guard. 

 Last month, courts martial sentenced two soldiers to death in separate cases for killing their superiors known as fragging.

 The manuals called Combat Stress Behaviours in LIC (low intensity conflict) Environment: Principles and Management, and Suicide and Fratricide: Dynamics and Management are to be carried by field commanders. 

 We have diagnosed 151 reasons why soldiers feel stress leading to suicide or fratricide, the director of the psychological research institute, Manas K. Mandal, said.

 Mandal said beginning October, the selection process for officers and troops was also being modified to identify not only the presence of positive traits but also the absence of negative traits in an individual.

 Separate manuals in Hindi have been prepared for troops below officer rank.

 - Jade sorry as racist slur moves beyond TV

 London, Jan. 21: An odd situation has arisen about whether Shilpa Shetty was subjected to bullying and racism by Jade Goody, who, as the world knows, was turfed out of Celebrity Big Brother on Friday night by a record vote. 

 Having first said she was a victim of racism, Shilpa withdrew the charge. Most commentators in Britain believe she was somehow encouraged by Channel 4 to do so. 

 And now, Jade, who had initially insisted that Shilpa was not subjected to racism, has admitted that the Bollywood actress was, after all. 

 Could this be something to do with Jades attempt to rescue her ruined career? 

 Today, in a News of the World interview, in which she spoke in grammatically correct sentences, itself a happy surprise, the paper reported that Celebrity Big Brother star Jade Goody sensationally confessed: Shilpa WAS a victim of racism and bullying. 

 Jade is donating her 50,000 appearance fee from Channel 4 plus the 50,000 from News of the World 100,000 in all to charity. 

 Whether Jades mother Jackiey and boyfriend Jack are also being generous isnt clear. 

 Jade was asked by the News of the World: Have you had any control over this interview? 

 Jade sounded like those prisoners who confess on Iranian television and accept the fairness of the Shariat court. 

 She replied with a clarity and a crispness which had not been evident on television: None whatsoever. I want to face the toughest questions possible. Everyone knows the News of the World is a tough paper and wont shirk from asking what people want to know. Im happy to put myself through this so people can see what I did was wrong and Im truly sorry. 

 Perhaps her critics should not be too cruel to the 25-year-old whose media advisers are working overtime to revive her shattered career. 

 More interesting was the News of the World story that Teddy Sheringham, the 40-year-old footballer Danielle Lloyd, 23, one of Jades gang members, has spoken endlessly about her hopes for marrying him had decided to dump his poisonous girlfriend. 

 In many ways, events have moved beyond reality television. 

 A senior official from Visit Britain today expressed fears that tourism from India, which brings 226 million into the treasury, could be affected because of the damage done to Britains image. 

 Bernard Donoghue, head of government and public affairs at the national tourism agency, said he was concerned about the impact that coverage of Shilpa in the Indian media would have on the British brand. 

 Although the issue might seem trivial, it ought not to be taken lightly, he warned. These kinds of things do affect how Britain is seen. 

 He was hopeful Jades behaviour would not lead to a downturn in relations with India. He wanted a major promotion of the IIFA awards which are to be held in Yorkshire this summer. 

 Donoghue said: Thats a fantastic opportunity to prove how we celebrate Bollywood in a way that maybe Channel 4 has not done this week.

 Message after Moscow massage: US deal fine

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 New Delhi, Jan. 25: Buoyed by Indias friendship with the US, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh laid on an effusive welcome for old friend and partner Russia today, the centrepiece of which was a promise by Moscow to construct four more nuclear reactors at Kudankulam as well as take military ties to a brand new level.

 Describing President Vladimir Putin as a world statesman and a special friend of India, Singh said that despite the sea change in international power relations in the last decade, Russia remains at the core of Indias foreign policy interests.

 At the Prime Ministers lunch before a news conference, it looked as if the good old days were back again. Besides Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul, Indias ideological spectrum was reflected in full measure.

 Left leaders like Sitaram Yechury, Brinda Karat and A.B. Bardhan, besides Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, were present, as were A.B. Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and Brajesh Mishra. Former Prime Minister as well as ambassador to the erstwhile Soviet Union, I.K. Gujral, also attended.

 Yet, the invisible presence of the American superpower in the room could not be denied. 

 The Russian President, asked by The Telegraph at the end of the welcome line about Moscows reaction to the Indo-US nuclear deal, stopped in mid-handshake and said: It is a positive step. We support India in its relations with Nuclear Suppliers Group countries like America.

 Clearly, Putin was referring to suggestions of potential rivalry between Moscow and Washington over New Delhi, symbolised by the Russian intent to construct four more nuclear reactors at Kudankulam (the memorandum of intent was signed at the media conference).

 Although Russia seemed to be ironically reaping the first advantage of US efforts to make India a global nuclear power, official sources confirmed that the offer in Kudankulam and elsewhere were subject to the Nuclear Suppliers Group amending its guidelines on India.

 The sources pointed out that the US, with an acknowledged veto on the NSG, would only allow such an amendment to take place after India and America cleared their bilateral nuclear deal (known as the 123 agreement).

 Still, this Putin visit to India marked by his presence as chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations will be remembered for the fact that Russia, having dropped out of the Indian consciousness for more than a decade, had decided to come back with a bang.

 Even though the nuclear reactors will now be subject to US approval, Russian officials were keen to emphasise that Moscow-made goods such as MiG fighters, said to be half the price of the US F-18s (both are competing for the IAF tender for 126 fighter jets), the fifth-generation fighter aircraft as well as the multi-role transport plane could compete with the best in the world.

 The Russian President pointed out that due to this direct and practical cooperation, Russias presence would show itself in several areas, especially in the exploration, production and transportation of hydrocarbons.

 Energy cooperation was a highlight of the visit. A memorandum of understanding between ONGC and its Russian counterpart, Rosneft, to explore the potential in the entire hydrocarbon chain was signed.

 Karat wags finger at Centres US tilt

 The 123 agreement (on nuclear cooperation)... seeks to bind India into a strategic alliance with the US to the detriment of our country

 Prakash Karat

 New Delhi, March 14: Days before India and the US sit down for the first time to discuss the parameters of their nuclear agreement, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat accused the government of allying with Washington to the detriment of the country and warned it would have to pay for its opportunistic foreign policy.

 I want to tell the UPA government, and particularly the Congress party, that it will have to pay a heavy political price. If the government doesnt stick to its commitment in the common minimum programme, we will go to the people, he said.

 Karats comments came at the end of a conference on War, Imperialism and Resistance in West Asia, and indicated that the Left parties were gearing up for a foreign policy battle.

 Our party has questioned the terms of the 123 agreement (on nuclear cooperation between India and the US, for which the first round of talks will be held later this month). This agreement seeks to bind India into a strategic alliance with the US to the detriment of our country.

 Karat said the common minimum programme, discussed threadbare with the Left parties before it was written down, called for a fresh thrust to ties with West Asia. But Israel had become Indias largest defence supplier, he said, because of which New Delhi was not interested in joining forces with Palestine.

 Indias willing strategic partnership with the US, or its junior alliance status, was defining relations with old friends across West Asia, Karat added. 

 This is opportunism, the CPM leader said. Writing one thing in the CMP and practising another will cost the UPA.

 Support to the Palestinian cause was mere lip service and formal. India hardly had any comment on brutalities being regularly committed by Israel against Palestine, Karat said, and it was not even forthright about asking Tel Aviv to stop building the wall that has turned Palestinian areas in West Bank into ghettos. 

 Demanding that the government come clean on its West Asia policies, the Left leader said Indias nuclear co-operation with the US could not come with conditions attached to it, such as on ties with Iran.

 The Left was glad, he said, that foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee had said there could be no military solution to the growing crisis over Irans nuclear programme. It is totally wrong if this government comes under pressure to disrupt state to state relations with Iran.

 He said the Left was closely watching the situation and warned against scuttling the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline under US pressure. The Left parties were not going to accept this.

 Karat said India was allowing itself to become the central pillar in an axis between Japan and Israel, overseen by Washington as the overweening power. He quoted ambassador David Mulford as saying the US had decided to help India become a major world power.

 The UPA was simply continuing with a policy started by the previous NDA regime, on the US and Israel, Karat added. When the BJP came to power in 1998, defence purchases from Israel amounted to $320 million, but when they lost power six years later, the figure had burgeoned to $2 billion.

 The BJP had paid because it ignored the anti-imperialist stand of the people, he said, and the UPA would suffer the same fate if it didnt pay heed.

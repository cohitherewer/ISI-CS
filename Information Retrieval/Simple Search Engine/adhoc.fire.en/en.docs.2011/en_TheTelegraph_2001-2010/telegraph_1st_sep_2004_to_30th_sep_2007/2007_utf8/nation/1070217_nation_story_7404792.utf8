 Jet then, Ranbaxy now

 K.P. NAYAR 

 Washington, Feb. 16: First there was Jet Airways. Now there is Ranbaxy. When it comes to a level-playing field in the US for Indian companies, India and America arent exactly natural allies.

 So it would seem from the mysterious raid that began mid-week at the North American headquarters of Ranbaxy Laboratories in Plainsboro and at Ohm Laboratories, its subsidiary in New Brunswick, both in New Jersey.

 Reporters who rushed to the Plainsboro location during the raid and were allowed access to the site by Ranbaxy staff were told to leave by officials conducting the search.

 There is a warrant being served, and we need you to step out into the hall, one official told a local reporter. He then corrected himself: In fact, we need you to leave this floor.

 When reporters persisted, the official gave them a telephone number in Washington for answers, but that phone number turned out to be not in service any more. Then reporters got another number, the US attorneys office in Maryland, but that office was closed and no one was answering phones there. 

 What is clear is that the raiders are from the US Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) office of criminal investigations (OCI) because they were wearing jackets which had FDA-OCI Federal Agent emblazoned on them.

 Ranbaxy officials have shown the warrant served on them by the FDA-OCI searchers to their lawyers, who appear to be puzzled. Our counsel told us it was very vague, Chuck Caprariello, vice-president of corporate communications and government affairs for Ranbaxy, said.

 He said the company was continuing to provide all material the investigators were asking for, even as reporters were being bumped from one possible source to another. 

 Although the officials conducting the search were clearly from FDA-OCI offices, Cathy McDermott, FDA spokeswoman, would not answer questions and referred all calls to the US department of justice. There, spokeswoman Marsha Murphy had the standard reply: We dont comment on ongoing investigations.

 In a statement, Ranbaxy said its US operations are unaffected. 

 The situation that Ranbaxy finds itself in here is eerily reminiscent of the plight of Jet Airways, which cheerfully embarked on plans to fly to America in 2005.

 Those plans were made only months after India and the US raised hopes of greater cooperation in the civil aviation sector with a bilateral open skies agreement. Jets business rivals here complained to the US department of transportation (DoT) that the Indian airline had terrorist links.

 A panicky DoT immediately referred those allegations to the behemoth US department of homeland security, where the charges languished for almost a year and a half while US airlines took advantage of the open skies agreement and started direct flights to India.

 Recently, DoT cleared Jet Airways, but more clearances, including some from the Federal Aviation Administration, are needed before the airline can touch down at any US airport. 

 Ranbaxy has been attracting attention in the US and the resentment of global pharmaceutical giants for challenging their right to exclusive patents, which allow these global firms to profit enormously even if they put medicines beyond the reach of millions of Americans.

 Ranbaxy has become one among the worlds top 10 manufacturers of generic drugs and hopes to raise its sales in the US to $5 billion by 2012, partly by taking advantage of Lipitor, the worlds best selling anti-cholesterol medicine, being freed from patent restrictions in 2010. Because of its record of producing generic medicines, Ranbaxy has been dubbed a copycat pharmaceutical company in industry circles here.

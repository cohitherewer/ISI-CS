 China plays safe on deal

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: China is closely watching the very fierce debate in India on the Indo-US nuclear deal but has so far taken a cautious view on the matter, largely because of its complicated nature, Chinas ambassador to India, Sun Yuxi, said here today.

 Speaking to a group of journalists at the Indian Womens Press Corps in the capital, Sun said: China does not want the Indo-US nuclear deal to weaken the non-proliferation regime. That is our concern. That is why, he added, the Chinese government has not reacted formally to the deal, preferring to take a very cautious position.

 The Chinese envoy, speaking for the first time since the 123 Agreement became public, admitted he was sometimes taken aback at the references to China being a factor in the domestic opposition to the nuclear deal. But Sun said he understood the Indian medias reaction.

 No, I am not hurt by the Indian medias comments (on China backing the Left parties), but I understand it. Perhaps, the western medias perception still stands in the way of our two countries understanding each other.

 Clearly, as the Indian media factors in China in the debate on the nuclear deal, the Chinese government looks like it wants to reach out and dispel the impression that it is seeking to limit Indias growing power.

 Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, in an unusual gesture last week, gave the departing PTI correspondent from China an unscheduled interview, where he spoke at length about the potential and reality of Asias greatest civilisations India and China.

 Sun spoke in much the same tone today, talking about the time when Wen told him to report back as often as possible about what we can learn from India. The ambassador said he was sending reports about every conceivable aspect of Indian life back home to Beijing, precisely because there was so much to learn from this country.

 In a lighter vein, he pointed out that India and the US were always talking about being the largest and oldest democracies in the world, but China was hardly lagging. We think we are also a democracy, only with a different style.

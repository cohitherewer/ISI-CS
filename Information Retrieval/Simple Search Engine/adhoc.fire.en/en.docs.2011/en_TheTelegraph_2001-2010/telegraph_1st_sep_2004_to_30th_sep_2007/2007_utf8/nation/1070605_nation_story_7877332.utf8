 Srinagar, June 4: Pressure from Kashmirs Muslim clergy has forced the army to decide against constructing or renovating shrines and mosques across the state. 

 We had never intended to interfere in the affairs of any religion. We will not undertake any work that hurts the sentiments of any community, Lieutenant General A.S. Sekhon told reporters at Ganderbal, 30 km from here.

 The army is a secular organisation. We have people of all faiths in the army and we have respect of the highest order for all faiths. What has been done has been done at the request of local people, added Sekhon, who heads the Srinagar-based 15 Corps.

 The move has put an end to a controversy that was triggered after cleric Mufti Bashiruddin issued a fatwa on May 28 against constructions of mosques, saying the Shariat prohibits any contribution by a non-Muslim.

 He asked the army to instead focus on the regions development.

 We welcome the armys decision to stop such constructions. It is nice and appreciable, and I think the confrontation is over, Bashiruddin told The Telegraph. 

 He, however, cautioned the army against covertly continuing the drive.

 The construction and renovation of mosques, carried out under Operation Sadhbhawna, have cost the army Rs 52 lakh so far. Under the operation, the army is looking to launch various development projects, one of which a cataract cancer detection and a blood donation camp was inaugurated by Sekhon today.

 Apart from Bashiruddin, several clergymen and senior separatist leaders had opposed the armys denigration of Muslim shrines and threatened demonstrations.

 Last week, around 70 clergymen led by Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, who heads the Hurriyats moderate faction, held a protest meeting in Srinagar. They urged the President and the Prime Minister to ensure that the forces stay out of the religious domain of Muslims. The army is denigrating our religious places in the guise of Operation Sadhbhawna. But this wont be tolerated, Mirwaiz had said.

 The cleric had also alleged that the army had a political agenda. Sekhon today dismissed the charge. The army is an apolitical and a secular organisation. Our primary job is to look after security needs and provide services to people, particularly in the remote areas. 

 He said the popularity of the operation could be gauged from the requests for projects like the medical camp.

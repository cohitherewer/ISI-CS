 US visa time limit

 Washington, April 12 (PTI): Petitions for the and P non-immigrant visas to the US can now be filed a year ahead. 

 The category provides admission to persons with extraordinary ability in arts, sciences, education, business or athletics, or those with extraordinary achievement in motion picture or television production. 

 The P category is for entertainers and athletes who cannot qualify under the extraordinary ability standard for the category.

 At present, petitions are allowed to be filed six months before a scheduled event. The short filing period often meant that case processing was not completed until or after the date the individual was needed in the US.

 The US Citizenship and Immigration Services is making the change through a final rule that was transmitted to the federal register today for publication on April 16, 2007.

 The decision will benefit Indians seeking to work in the US.

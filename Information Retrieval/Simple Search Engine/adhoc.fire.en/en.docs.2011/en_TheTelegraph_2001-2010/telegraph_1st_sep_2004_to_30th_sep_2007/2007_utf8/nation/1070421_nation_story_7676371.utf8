 Now, sip sweet sea water

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, April 20: Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal on Wednesday poured himself a glass of water from the Bay of Bengal, took a sip and smiled.

 Excellent, Sibal said, after tasting the water produced by a desalination plant off the coast of Chennai that is now making a million litres of desalinated water a day.

 The plant, mounted on a barge floating in the sea about 40 km off the coast of Chennai, represents a forerunner technology that may allow communities along the countrys coastline to draw freshwater from the sea.

 The 1-million-litre-per-day plant, designed by the National Institute of Ocean Technology, Chennai, involved a Rs 22-crore investment and can produce water that costs less than 5 paise per litre, Sibal said.

 Sea water from the surface is flash evaporated at 28 C in a chamber maintained in a state closer to vacuum than to normal air pressure. Then water from relatively deeper sea, which is much cooler, is used to condense the evaporated water.

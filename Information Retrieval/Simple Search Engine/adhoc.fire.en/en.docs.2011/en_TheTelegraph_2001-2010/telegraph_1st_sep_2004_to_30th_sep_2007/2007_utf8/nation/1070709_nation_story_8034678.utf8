 Mom of 8 weds dad of 7, kids cry foul

 SHAHNAWAZ AKHTAR 

 Giridih, July 8: Just married, Jawahar Chaudhary and Priyanka Devi have their hands full.

 The bride has eight children and the groom seven. 

 If equality of headcount is essential for marital bliss, the husband has an ace up his sleeve: he has another wife.

 The wedding in a Jharkhand village initially aroused interest because of their age: Priyanka (name changed) is 50 and Jawahar is 45.

 But interest turned into excited chatter when the number of their children was confirmed. 

 The village Dharharwa, around 85km from Giridih is now divided between those who support the fruition of love against odds and those who oppose.

 The opponents include the children of both the groom and the bride. So infuriated are the sons of Priyanka, a widow before the remarriage, that they have tonsured their heads saying their mother is no more.

 But not all are crying sacrilege. If you think only people living in cities marry at any time and whoever they like, you are wrong. People living in far-flung villages also show the courage to get what they want, said a villager on his way back from the wedding in a temple.

 Priyanka Devi was married to the late Dum Pasi while Chaudhary is still legally married to his estranged wife. He has not divorced yet.

 The opposition to the marriage shows no sign of dying down as some villagers, aided by the couples children, have launched a campaign to mobilise opinion against the union. But no one has yet challenged the validity of the new marriage, citing Chaudharys earlier alliance. 

 But Chaudhary is adamant. The only thing that prompted him to go against everyone, he said, is love.

 After the marriage was solemnised in the temple, he said: I love Priyanka and I will live with her from now on.

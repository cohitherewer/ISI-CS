 Setu stalls Parliament

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 16: Sharp exchanges over the Sethusamudram project between the BJP and the UPA-Left forced the Lok Sabha to adjourn early today.

 When shipping and transport minister T.R. Baalu said no study had revealed the existence of any structure of archaeological importance, the BJP retorted that the Ram Setu the mythical bridge built by Rams army between India and Sri Lanka was a matter of faith.

 The BJP charged the government with hurting Hindu sentiment, prompting the Congress and Baalus DMK to accuse that party of playing politics over a channel that would slash sailing time between Indias east and west coasts.

 As the two sides targeted each other, Speaker Somnath Chatterjee adjourned the House for an hour and a half. Later, it had to be adjourned for the day.

 Wife in loo plea

 New Delhi, March 20 (PTI): A court today listed for hearing a womans plea for a directive under the domestic violence act to her in-laws to let her use the bathroom and the kitchen in her marital home.

 Metropolitan magistrate Bhupesh Kumar will hear the case, filed under the Protection Of Women From Domestic Violence (Prevention) Act, 2005, on May 1.

 An order for the use of one room at my father-in-laws house has earlier been passed by the court. But I am feeling very uneasy without the use of kitchen and bathroom, Asha Mallik said in her application.

 In an interim order, the court had on December 22 restrained her husband Deepak Kaushik and his parents Om Prakash and Kamlesh, residents of Bawana in north-west Delhi, from dispossessing Asha from the house. 

 She had alleged after two years of marriage in 2002, they started beating her for dowry and threw her out of the house last November.

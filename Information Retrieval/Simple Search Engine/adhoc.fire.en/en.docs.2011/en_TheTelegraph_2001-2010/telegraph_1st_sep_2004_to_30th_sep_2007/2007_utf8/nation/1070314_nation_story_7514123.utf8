 Court throws out Mulayam plea

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 13: The Supreme Court today refused to entertain Mulayam Singh Yadavs application for a stay on the CBI graft probe against him till the Assembly elections are over.

 A bench headed by Justice A.R. Lakshmanan, which ordered the probe into Mulayams assets on a PIL which alleged that they were amassed through corrupt means, said an application to modify the order could not be heard as the matter was disposed of.

 The remedy available to Mulayam was to file a review petition against the March 1 verdict, it said. Unlike applications, a review petition is generally not heard in the open court.

 How can an interim application lie if a matter is disposed of? the bench asked.

 It was not impressed by Mulayams counsel Altaf Ahmeds contention that the court could hear the interim application as there has been such instances in the past.

 The matter is finished. You cannot file interim application, the court said. There is no rule. We have to go by the Supreme Court rule.

 When Ahmed requested that permission be given for the review petition to be heard in court, the bench refused to give any assurance.

 CBI sources said preliminary investigations into Mulayams assets would take at least three months. A report has to be submitted to the Centre.The sources said it would be difficult for the CBI to submit a report before the polls were over. But investigations would go on during the elections.

 Mulayam had requested the court to stay the probe to ensure a level-playing field during the elections. He alleged that the UPA government would use the CBI to frame him and his family to win the elections.

 He claimed the PIL was a proxy litigation on behalf of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and there was little likelihood of an independent inquiry.

 As income-tax authorities were already probing the allegations, a CBI inquiry should be ordered only after a report by the department, he said.

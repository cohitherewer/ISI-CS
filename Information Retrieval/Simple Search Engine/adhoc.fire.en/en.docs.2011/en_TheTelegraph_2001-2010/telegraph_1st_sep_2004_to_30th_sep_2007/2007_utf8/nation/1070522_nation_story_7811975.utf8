 New channel rises on Sun TV

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Chennai, May 21: A new channel threatens to challenge the sway of Sun TV, owned by the Maran family that has fallen out with DMK chief M. Karunanidhi. 

 The channels launch on June 3, Karunanidhis 84th birthday, is being seen as the opening of a new flank in the battle between the Maran brothers and the DMK patriarch.

 The new channel is named Kalaignar TV. Karunanidhi is called Kalaignar, which means a litterateur, because of his writing skills. The man behind Kalaignar TV is Rajendran, who owns Raj TV, a lesser-known Tamil channel.

 The news channel will focus on the DMKs activities, especially those of Karunanidhis two sons, M.K. Stalin and M.K. Azhagiri, and his daughter Kanimozhi. 

 I am launching Kalaignar TV after consultations with DMK leaders, said Rajendran. He did not give details.

 A new channel is hardly good news for Sun TV, which has been getting the short shrift from DMK leaders since the May 9 attack on the offices of Dinakaran, part of the Sun group.

 The newspaper had carried an opinion poll that put M.K. Stalin far ahead of elder brother M.K. Azhagiri in the party succession race. The report provoked a mob claiming allegiance to Azhagiri to launch a firebomb attack on the dailys office in Madurai, killing three employees.

 Sun TV was blacked out from the events of May 11, when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi felicitated Karunanidhi for completing 50 years as a legislator. The feed was given to Raj TV, which beamed the celebrations in Chennai live.

 This was a signal that the DMK wanted to snap ties with the Sun media network. It came just a day before the DMK recalled Dayanidhi Maran from the Union cabinet.

 Raj TV had been given a raw deal when Dayanidhi headed the IT and communications ministry, which decides how much spectrum (air waves) is to be allotted to TV channels.

 Sun TV and Dinakaran played a key role in the DMKs return to power in last years polls by projecting Karunanidhi, Stalin, Azhagiri and Daynanidhi as a united face. 

 But as Kalanidhi Maran, who runs the Sun network, grew in clout, many in the DMK began resenting the Marans nouveau riche attitude. Kalanidhis decision to run Dinakaran, acquired from another group, on more professional lines and not as a DMK appendage widened the cracks. 

 Some DMK leaders have been telling Karunanidhi about the need to have a Tamil TV channel and newspaper of its own. Jayalalithaas ADMK has Jaya TV, while S. Ramadosss PMK launched Makkal TV last year.

 Kalanidhi has other worries, too. Sun TV is being sounded out to vacate its office in the DMK headquarters. The party is also trying to break the stranglehold of Sumangali Cable Vision, part of the Sun network, on the cable business. Sources say rival Hathway has received an informal approval to expand in Tamil Nadu.

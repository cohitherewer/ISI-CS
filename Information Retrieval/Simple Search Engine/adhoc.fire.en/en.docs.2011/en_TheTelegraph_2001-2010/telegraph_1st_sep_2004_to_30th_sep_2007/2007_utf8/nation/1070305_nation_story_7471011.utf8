 Militant axe on obscene channels

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Protected?

Srinagar, March 4: Cable operators in the Valley have switched off some entertainment channels after militant groups Al Madina and Al Badr issued a diktat. 

 We have taken three obscene channels STAR Movies, STAR World and Sony Pix off air, said an operator associated with Waadi Television, which caters to most of Srinagars old city.

 Another cable operator said they, too, had received a call from the militants telling them to stop beaming two local channels. 

 Earlier, the militant groups had called up a local news agency to threaten operators. We had asked them to stop beaming obscene channels but since they did not comply they should shut their operations completely, the groups warned. 

 Fearing trouble, the cable operators have stopped beaming the channels. 

 North Srinagar superintendent of police Bashir Ahmad Khan, however, said no cable operator has so far come forward with any complaint. If they do, we will take appropriate action. 

 The last time militants had issued such a diktat was a year ago and it ended with the operators pledging to stop beaming obscene channels. They took some channels off air but resumed operations after the militant threat subsided. 

 A few months back, militants succeeded in imposing a complete ban in Sopore town of north Kashmir that has witnessed a resurgence of militant activity. 

 Cable operations in the Valley started in the mid-90s amid strong opposition by militant groups three employees were also killed. The operators were allowed to continue after occasional pledges that they will not air obscene channels. 

 There are dozens of cable groups that operate across most of Kashmir and the industry employs hundreds of youths in the state.

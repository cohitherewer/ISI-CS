 Maoists renew threat to CMs 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhattacharjee, Reddy 

 Hyderabad, May 5: Maoists have renewed their threat against the chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Bengal for acquiring farmland for special economic zones and giving a free hand to police to rein in the rebels.

 A document released by the CPI (Maoist) central committee lists 37 people, including politicians, industrialists and policemen, as prime targets, prompting the Union home ministry to alert both Andhra and Bengal to upgrade security of their chief ministers, Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 The warning has come at a time when the Andhra chief minister is leaving for a week-long tour of the US and Singapore. State intelligence officers are now working overtime to beef up security for his entourage and also during his meetings abroad.

 Among the events lined up is an address to the World Agricultural Forum at St Louis. Reddy will also call on global IT leaders in Los Angeles and meet industry captains in Singapore.

 Sources said the Maoists are unhappy with Reddy for providing a free hand to the police to comb the forests. A recent CPI (Maoist) congress in Chhattisgarh had hailed raids on jails and police stations. The congress had justified its actions in Bengal, Bihar, Andhra and Orissa with respect to forcible acquisition of farmland by the state governments.

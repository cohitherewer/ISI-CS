 Nurse rape charge on doctor

 Ghaziabad, Aug. 21 (PTI): An FIR has been registered against a doctor who runs a nursing home for allegedly raping one of his staff, police said.

 Pradeep Gupta was arrested last night on the basis of a complaint by a nurse. 

 He had made her pregnant, senior superintendent of police Deepak Ratan said. 

 Gupta was released on bail today.

 The nurse had demanded the status of the doctors wife after giving birth to his child, the police added.

 She gave birth to a boy in December 2005 but refused to hand over the baby to Gupta and his physician wife, who have no children.

 The nurse, who is married, then filed an application with the National Commission for Women against the doctor in May 2006. 

 Two days ago, the commission recommended that a case be registered against Gupta, Ratan said.

 The nurse has demanded DNA tests for the baby, Gupta and herself, he added.

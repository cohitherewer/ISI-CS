 Science congress for coal freedom

 M. R. VENKATESH

 Chidambaram (Tamil Nadu), Jan. 8: The 94th session of the Indian Science Congress (ISC) drew to a close here last night with a call to deregulate the coal sector. The example cited was the iron and steel sector, which was decontrolled by the central government in the early 1990s. 

 Pitching for the move were the ISCs outgoing president Harsh Gupta and general secretary Avijit Banerji. While coal helps generate 70 per cent of the countrys 120,000 MW of power, the speakers reminded policymakers that coal supply isnt going to last forever. 

 Production was not keeping pace with requirements and hence the sector should be decontrolled, they said, pointing to the contribution of private steel players in increasing supply after deregulation. 

 The congress also stressed the need for accurate monsoon forecasts and better prediction models. 

 Another key point was to institutionalise the study of earthquakes. The congress, whose focal theme this year was Planet Earth, called for unshackling the Geological Survey of India from the bureaucracy. It suggested the GSI be merged with the ministry of earth sciences.

 At the concluding session, former VC of Tirupatis Sri Venkateswara University R. Ramamurthi was elected general president of the congress for 2007-08.

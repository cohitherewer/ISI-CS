 ICL glare on stadium

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: The Indian Cricket League has accused the Karnataka State Cricket Association, an affiliate of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), of using Bangalores Chinnaswamy Stadium for everything else but cricket. 

 The stadium has often been allowed by the association to be used for purposes other than playing and the promotion of cricket, including beauty pageants (Miss World 1996) and political rallies, the leagues petition in Delhi High Court said.

 The refusal to permit the league to use the stadium for a tournament was a conspiracy between the BCCI and the state unit to cause loss to it, the petition added.

 Yesterday, the league said a private and autonomous body like the BCCI had no right to use the word India in its name or fly the national flag in its tournaments.

 The league has dubbed the BCCI controversy-ridden, arbitrary and monopolistic and held it guilty of various acts like intimidation, mala fide actions, malfeasance, conspiracy, public nuisance.

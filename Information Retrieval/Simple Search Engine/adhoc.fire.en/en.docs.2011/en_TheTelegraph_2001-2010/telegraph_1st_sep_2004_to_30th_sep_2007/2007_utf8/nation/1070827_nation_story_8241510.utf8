 Star on AIDS role warpath

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 26: Tamil actress Simran has threatened to sue the makers of her debut Malayalam film for Rs 20 crore for casting her as an AIDS patient.

 Heartbeats was recently pulled off theatres only three days after its release. Simran plays the protagonist in the film, who falls in love with a house surgeon, played by Indrajit, in a medical college. She dies of AIDS in the end.

 The news about Simran acting in a Malayalam film was received with great fanfare in the Kerala film industry. 

 The glamour queen from the neighbouring state had earlier cold-shouldered several offers from Malayalam filmmakers. But now she is no more a rage in Tamil filmdom.

 The actress said she was shocked to find that her character in Heartbeats, Thankam George, was an AIDS patient as the script did not mention it. Simran, however, decided to complete the film before raising her voice. 

 I am going to sue the producer and the director for Rs 200 million (Rs 20 crore), she said.

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The Centre today withdrew the entire affidavit that had questioned the existence of Ram, citing total respect for all religions, Hinduism in particular.

 The government also promised to review the route of the proposed Sethusamudram shipping canal to see if the Adams Bridge lime shoals the so-called Rams setu could be spared. But it did not promise that the route would be changed.

 Law minister H.R. Bharadwaj had yesterday told the Supreme Court the offending parts of the affidavit (paragraphs 5, 6 and 20) would be removed, but additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam today withdrew the whole affidavit. He sought three months for the route review.

 Petitioners and saffron groups claim that the partially submerged islet chain extending from India to Sri Lanka is an artificial structure built by Rams monkey army.

 The original affidavit, prepared by the Archaeological Survey of India, had said there was no incontrovertible proof that Ram ever lived, handing the Sangh parivar political ammunition against the Congress-led government.

 The central government has total respect for all religions, and Hinduism in particular, in the context of the present case, Subramaniam read out from a statement in court.

 The central government is alive and conscious of religious sensibilities, including the unique, ancient and holy text of the Ramayan. The affidavit did not intend to touch upon the freedom/articles of faith or belief of any section of society.

 A formal affidavit explaining the governments position will be filed on Monday or Tuesday, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi later said.

 Subramaniam said the original affidavit was being withdrawn because of public sentiment and because the government had received representations, including additional material since the document was filed.

 The central government, without any reservation, in a spirit of inclusiveness and high democratic tradition, (and) to consider a different point of view, withdraws the present affidavit to re-examine the entire matter.

 CPM pat

 The CPM politburo today welcomed the governments decision to withdraw the affidavit. Terming it an appropriate move, the party said the references to lack of historical evidence of Rams existence were considered extraneous to the matter at hand.

 However, it must be reiterated that there is no scientific evidence whatsoever that a man-made structure, the Adams Bridge, exists in the Palk Straits. What exists are natural formations, it said.

 RTI snub to union leader

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: All citizens of India have the right to information. But not if they happen to represent a trade union or any other association, as the CPMs Dipankar Mukherjee recently found out. 

 Mukherjee, a former Rajya Sabha member and secretary of the CPMs trade arm Citu, had written to the finance ministry on the Citu letterhead seeking information on the tax concessions given to Enron companies in Dabhol. 

 I was denied the information on the ground that only citizens and not organisations or associations are entitled to this information under the 2005 RTI (Right to Information) Act, he said.

 The reply from the finance ministrys revenue department cited Section 3 of the act, which gives right to information to citizens of India. But the term citizen has not been defined, it said.

 The ministry, therefore, looked up the 1955 citizenship act, whose definition of citizen does not include any company, association or body of individuals. It is in view of this that we cannot give you the information, the revenue department told the Citu leader.

 Mukherjee then approached the appellate authority a joint secretary in the finance ministry. He wrote back saying the department has correctly interpreted the term citizen in the 2005 act.

 The Citu secretary finally wrote to the chief information officer on January 30. I seek your immediate intervention to clarify my right as a citizen in the capacity of Citu secretary, Mukherjee said in his letter. He is yet to hear from the officer.

 Citu president M.K. Pandhe accused the authorities of using the loopholes in the act to deny people information. He pointed out that the Citu had earlier got information from the ministry of heavy industries. But the RTI act leaves scope for arbitrariness, which the finance ministry is taking advantage of, he added.

 Lawyers Collective, a non-government organisation, came up against similar hurdles when it sought information from the judiciary on the appointment of judges. We were denied the information, said Asmita Basu of the Collective. 

 But the organisation got the information it had sought on the Delhi sealing drive from the urban development ministry.

 The information given by the ministries is often incomplete, Pandhe alleged. 

 Venkatesh Naik of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, an organisation involved in improving the implementation of the RTI act, said it is absolutely unfair to deny anybody information simply because he happens to represent a trade union. It is a misinterpretation of the law.

 Tainted blood whiff in AIIMS death

 New Delhi, March 28: The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) today faced allegations of having mistakenly infused HIV-infected blood into a 17-year-old who was among hundreds of patients treated here during the dengue outbreak last year. 

 The girl, a Class XII student in the middle of her board exams, died this Sunday. 

 They killed her. They took my sisters life, said a broken Yogesh Chauhan, the girls brother. 

 An initially hassled AIIMS administration conducted an internal inquiry before denying any negligence on the part of the institute. The girl, officials said, was already HIV positive when she was brought to AIIMS last November. 

 When we brought her here on November 2, they diagnosed her with Crohns disease (an inflammatory bowel disease) and dengue, Yogesh said. 

 With her platelet count plunging, doctors at AIIMS infused 20 units of blood. 

 Discharged on November 18, she was however readmitted on March 11 with respiratory problems. 

 She eventually died on March 26, of acute respiratory distress coupled with sepsis. 

 While Yogesh claims her condition at the time of death had weakened because of the HIV infection, AIIMS doctors said it was impossible to contract AIDS from HIV within a span of four months. 

 By evening, AIIMS medical superintendent Dr. D.K. Sharma told The Telegraph that an internal inquiry had confirmed the girl was already infected with HIV when she was brought to the hospital in November. 

 Since Crohns disease can be actuated by HIV, we tested her for it. Her tests show she was HIV-positive when she was brought here, he said. 

 AIIMS authorities, however, were unable to explain why the girls family was not informed about her HIV-positive status. 

 The last three months of 2006 saw over 50 people die of dengue at AIIMS during the post-monsoon outbreak of the disease in the capital and other parts of India. 

 Hundreds of others, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs grandsons and son-in-law, were treated here for dengue or other diseases showing symptoms similar to the mosquito-bred disease. 

 Earlier today, senior AIIMS administration officials were quietly discussing the possibility of some truth in the allegations. 

 Faced with a severe shortage of blood from its own blood bank during the outbreak, AIIMS had to procure blood from several other sources. 

 While all the blood banks we source from are reputed, theoretically every unit of blood should be checked for infections again by us before we infuse the blood. 

 But when peoples survival depends on transfusion within seconds, one does not always have time for such measures, a senior pathologist, who asked not to be named, said.

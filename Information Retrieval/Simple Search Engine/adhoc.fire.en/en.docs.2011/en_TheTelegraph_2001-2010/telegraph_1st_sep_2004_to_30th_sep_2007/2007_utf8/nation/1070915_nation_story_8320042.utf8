 Brand R keeps sheen

 ANANYA SENGUPTA

 Mumbai, Sept. 14: Rahul Dravids decision to quit as captain is unlikely to diminish his brand value to any large extent, the ad industry says.

 The brands that signed him didnt do it because he was India captain but because they associated certain values with him: reliability, commitment, dependability, (the aura of) a great performer with a clean image, said Anirban Das Blah, vice-president of Globosport India.

 Adman Prahlad Kakkar felt that whatever little reduction in market worth Dravid may suffer initially, a few good innings would be enough to offset it.

 His brand value might dip a little bit. A captain is a captain the weight of leadership always helps a brand, Kakkar said.

 But again, brand value is really performance. He has to perform. Also, one has to remember that captaincy is a high-risk job (a captain) might fail to perform. As a player, he might fare better and thus do a lot better as a brand.

 Some brands, however, do equate captaincy with leadership abilities. When Sourav Ganguly lost his captaincy and his place in the side, he was rarely seen on TV. But as soon as he returned to the team, a string of good performances lifted his fees back into the crore bracket.

 Dravid has one advantage, though. Unlike some others, he has quit at a time when everyone wants him to stay. So, he will continue to enjoy goodwill. This will reinforce his brand value, Blah said.

 In 2006, when Dravid took over as captain, he clocked 180 hours of TV airtime and 16 brand endorsements better than Sachin Tendulkar, who endorsed 17 brands and had 121 hours of airtime.

 Dravid is estimated to earn $3.5 million (over Rs 14 crore) a year from endorsement deals, a little less than Tendulkars $4.6 million (Rs 18.6 crore). Tendulkar is reported to command Rs 6-7 crore in annual fees per endorsement, while Dravid gets Rs 1.5-2 crore.

 Age has not been a problem with Indias superstar cricketers. The advertisers have bet between Rs 250 crore and Rs 300 crore on Tendulkar, Dravid and Sourav. Earlier this year, Canon signed a three-year contract with Tendulkar who was far below his peak form.

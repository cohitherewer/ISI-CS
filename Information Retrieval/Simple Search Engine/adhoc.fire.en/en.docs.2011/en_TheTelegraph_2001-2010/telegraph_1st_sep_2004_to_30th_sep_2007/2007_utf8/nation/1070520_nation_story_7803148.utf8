 Lover to killer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May19: Koushambi Layeks mother finally has her answers.

 Naval officer Manish Thakur, the suspect in the murder of the 24-year-old software engineer, today confessed to Mumbai police that he had felt betrayed by his lady love when she refused to accept his proposal of marriage.

 It was a crime of passion. He had bought the weapon from his hometown and murdered her in the hotel room. Manishs relationship with his wife had broken down and he reacted violently to what he saw as betrayal from Koushambi. Although he had a plan, it seems he hadnt thought it through, said additional commissioner of police Bipin Bihari.

 Manish, in a green T-shirt and blue denim, reached Mumbai yesterday. A police officer accompanying him from Goa said the 28-year-old showed no apparent signs of remorse.

 In court, when the magistrate asked him if he had anything to say, Manish said: No. There was no defence lawyer for him. He was remanded in police custody till May 28.

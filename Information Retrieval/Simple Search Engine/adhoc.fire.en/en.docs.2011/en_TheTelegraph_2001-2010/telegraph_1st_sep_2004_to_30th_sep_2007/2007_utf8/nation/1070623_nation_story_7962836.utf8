 Small-town feud hits big time

 Pratibha: Kin trouble?

 Mumbai, June 22: The murder scandal that has suddenly assailed Pratibha Patil is mired in intrigue, involving an intra-Congress power struggle, a street assassination and a mystery phone call.

 V.G. Patil, lecturer at Nutan Maratha College in Jalgaon town, had been district Congress president for several years during which the party slid into decline. After the BJP dominated the last three Lok Sabha elections in the once Congress bastion, he was replaced with Pratibhas brother G.N. Patil.

 That split the Jalgaon unit into feuding camps till matters came to a head in the run-up to the September 2005 district elections.

 G.N. Patil was asked by the party to conduct the polls. He packed the polling machinery with his loyalists and then himself jumped into the fray, said Shrirang Chaudhary, who was close to V.G. Patil.

 When the votes were counted, V.G. Patil had won by a slender margin. According to his wife Rajini, who also taught at Nutan Maratha College, his death warrant was signed that day.

 A few days later, on September 21, the new district unit chief climbed into his Maruti Zen and left his home at Pimprala on the outskirts of Jalgaon town around 7.15am. As the car took a turn at Manraj Park, two men sitting at a tea stall chucked a few stones.

 The politician got off the car to see who had thrown the stones when two motorbike riders, faces half-hidden by helmets, appeared on the scene and killed him with a sharp weapon.

 Five days later, then Jalgaon police chief V. Koregaonkar, received an anonymous call. The caller said the killers were Raju Mali, a Congress worker, and Rajeev Sonawane, a history-sheeter.

 Mali, who had close links with almost all local Congress leaders, told the police that the murder had been ordered by G.N. Patil and his associate Ulhas Patil, a doctor and former Congress MP.

 The day Mali and Sonawane were arrested, Rajini pointed the finger at G.N. Patil for the first time. Over the next few months, she wrote to several powerful people, including Congress president Sonia Gandhi, seeking justice.

 The allegations ensured the transfer of the probe to the state criminal investigation department. The CID arrested two others, Damu Lokhand and Nilu Narkhede, but a local court gave them bail.

 Mali stuck to his allegation and filed a petition with the Aurangabad bench of Bombay High Court asking for a CBI probe. The court ordered a CBI probe two months ago. Around the same time, Mali died of AIDS.

 Justice at villagers door

 MANAN KUMAR

New Delhi, April 16: The judicial system will soon reach the doorsteps of poor villagers who now need to travel huge distances and spend large sums to settle petty disputes.

 The Union cabinet on Thursday cleared the Gram Nyayalayas Bill, 2007, for tabling in the next session of Parliament. It seeks to set up 5,067 gram nyayalayas (village courts) at the block level across the country, except Jammu and Kashmir.

 These courts, the lowest in the rungs of the judicial system, are expected to lighten the countrywide backlog of nearly 2.5 crore cases.

 From their official building in the block, these single-judge courts will also travel to villages from time to time to hear parties who cannot make it to the courthouse. Verdicts will be delivered fast, mostly in a matter of hours. 

 The village courts will deal with civil and criminal cases involving fines of up to Rs 1,000 or simple imprisonment up to one year.

 Each will be presided over by a nyaya adhikari an official of the rank of first-class judicial magistrate appointed by the governor in consultation with the chief justice of the state high court. 

 The nyaya adhikari will have a support staff of four people: a bench clerk or reader, an office clerk, an orderly and a peon. For the sake of flexibility, each high court will be empowered to lay down the rules governing the village courts in its home state.

 According to the law ministry, the village courts will be able to dispose of 30 to 40 lakh cases a year. The Supreme Court has estimated that 2.41 crore cases are pending in the countrys courts as of March 2006. Setting up the 5,067 courts is expected to cost the exchequer Rs 800-1,000 crore. The cost of running them all will come to Rs 500-600 crore a year.

 The Centre will initially provide Rs 324 crore a year towards the running costs. As for the one-time expenditure to establish them, the Centre will take the matter up with the respective states and divide the cost, a law and justice ministry official said.

 The nyayalayas law may not come into force simultaneously across the country. The Centre may notify different dates for different states.

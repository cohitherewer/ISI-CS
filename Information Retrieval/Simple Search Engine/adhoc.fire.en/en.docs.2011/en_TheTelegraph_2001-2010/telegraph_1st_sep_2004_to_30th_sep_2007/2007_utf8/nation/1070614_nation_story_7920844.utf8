 Delight then, debate now

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 13: Nobody in the Congress is questioning Shivraj Vishwanath Patils likely candidature for President but some discerning leaders are finding it hard to gloss over the contrast with another choice three years ago.

 In the last two days, some Congress leaders and cabinet ministers have been discussing and debating why Sonia Gandhi opted for Patil.

 Such a debate is interesting because in May 2004, Sonias choice of Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister was seen as a master stroke, a flawless choice which won approval from even critics of his economic policies. 

 But this time round, the mood is different. Those familiar with the way the party functions said Patils possible candidature has proved their worst fears right.

 According to this school of thought, Patils name was thrown up as a result of the somewhat skewed decision-making process in the Congress. The extension of this logic is that several more deserving names were grounded by a small group of leaders calling the shots in the party.

 Patil is perceived to be a lightweight who lacks in seniority and political stature. The home minister, who lost the 2004 Lok Sabha polls from Latur, has little mass appeal outside his hometown. Patil should know Latur well: he served as president of the municipality from 1967 to 1969 and again from 1971 to 1972.

 If he did not hog the limelight in national politics, he did put the spare time to good use. Patil has authored five books Reminiscences and Reflections, Emerging Vision of India, Ecstasy and Agony of a Presiding Officer, Fragrance of Inner Self and Dialogues.

 But none of these publications ever became a talking point. Reminiscences and Reflections was supposed to be an autobiographical account dealing with the authors early life and his thoughts and actions in later life. But the book is largely without data, statistics or quotations. The emphasis is on his public life rather than on his personal life, on issues rather than on personalities.

 But sources close to Sonia paint a different picture of Patil. They said Patil left a lasting impression on the Congress chief when she was a first-time MP between 1999 and 2004. During most of this period, Patil served as deputy leader of the Lok Sabha and assisted her in familiarising herself with parliamentary procedures and conventions.

 In those five years, Patil was able to project himself as a mature leader and an astute commentator on a range of subjects. He also shared with her innovations on primary and secondary education, hospitals and civic facilities he had introduced in Latur.

 Sonia is said to be impressed by Patils other remarkable achievement: introducing the committee system in Parliament during his tenure as Lok Sabha Speaker from 1991-96. Patil took the initiative in the tenth Lok Sabha and formulated the scheme after discussions.

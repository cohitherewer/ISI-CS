 India Inc on Kamal turf

 Kamal Nath and Sunil Mittal 

 Feb. 21: Two jets full of leading Indian industrialists today flew down to Union commerce minister Kamal Naths home constituency Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh to examine the investment climate there.

 Corporate honchos who flew down for the day included Bharti group chairman Sunil Mittal, Hero Corporate Services MD Sunil Munjal, DCM Shriram chairman and senior MD Ajay S. Shriram and Triveni Engineering and Industries Limited chairman-cum-managing director Dhruv M. Sawhney.

 Mittal was seen interacting with nearly 5,000 farmers in Goriya village, exploring the feasibility of getting supplies of forest and agriculture produce for his ambitious retail sector foray.

 He said he was impressed by Chhindwaras range of products like maize and potato. He said if the state government toned up the road, water and power infrastructure, Chhindwara could emerge as a hub of agriculture and forest products.

 The industry captains mixed business with pleasure, attending a wedding at zilla panchayat president Vishwanath Oktes home. Mittal and others broke bread with the farmers there, generously helping themselves to local delicacies.

 One of the CEOs present said: The minister wanted to show us the hidden investment potential in smaller states and villages and stressed the importance of inclusive growth.

 The industrialists are believed to have attended a joint meeting held by Nath and Babulal Gaur, the Madhya Pradesh industry minister. They also met the Chhindwara district collector and a few senior officials in the agriculture ministry.

 Sources said the minister had taken the opportunity to draw attention to Madhya Pradesh, which is lagging behind other states in attracting long-term industrial investments.

 Nath said Munjal, Shriram and others were hugely impressed by Chhindwaras potential and decided to set up a Centre of Confederation of Indian Industry there. The choice of Chhindwara is interesting as the CII does not have a regional office even in the state capital, Bhopal.

 Mittal, who is CII coordinator, also announced setting up of a National Institute of Information Technology.

 Naths close associate R.K. Mighlani said the farmers interaction with industrialists was a two-way flow. While the farmers highlighted their problems, they also made insightful observations when questioned on specific problems relating to agriculture.

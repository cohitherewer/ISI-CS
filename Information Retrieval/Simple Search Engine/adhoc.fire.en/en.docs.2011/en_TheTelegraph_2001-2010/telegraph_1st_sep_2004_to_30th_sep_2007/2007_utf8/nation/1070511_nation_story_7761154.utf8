 Chained by father over wife

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, May 10: A man was chained and confined to a room by his father for weeks because he had married against his wishes.

 Residents of West Joynagar village of Baduria in North 24-Parganas saw Ruhunamin Molla, 22, being taken to hospital in chains this morning.

 An eyewitness said Ruhunamin, who looked haggard and ill, had not been seen for three weeks.

 I had to confine my son since he wanted to meet his wife all the time, said Ruhunamins father, Sabur, an affluent farmer.

 Ruhunamin married Shahnawaz two years ago, but the couple lived apart because of Saburs opposition. 

 Shahnawaz lodged a complaint with Basirhat police on April 14, alleging that her husband had been confined by her in-laws.

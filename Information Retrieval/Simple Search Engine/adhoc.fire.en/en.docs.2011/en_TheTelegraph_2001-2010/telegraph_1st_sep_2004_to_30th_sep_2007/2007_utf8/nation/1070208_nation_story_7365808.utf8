 London, Feb. 7: Shilpa Shetty had a private 10-minute meeting today with Tony Blair who apologised to the Bollywood star for the abuse she had suffered on Celebrity Big Brother. 

 After the meeting, which took place at the House of Commons, Shilpa interacted with a 100-strong medium scrum, consisting of journalists, photographers and TV cameramen from Britain, the US and a contingent which had flown in from India. 

 The location was unusual on the banks of the Thames river. Wearing a white Nita Lulla jacket with a sari and with her ubiquitous mother, Sunanda, by her side, Shilpa recounted: The Prime Minister was really, really kind. He said that I carried myself with the utmost dignity. 

 She added: He said he was very sad to see what I had to go through in the (Big Brother) House. In turn, I said I really needed to thank him personally for all the support he showed me and my country. I took the opportunity and I thanked him. He was very, very sweet.

 Earlier, the winner of Celebrity Big Brother sat in on Prime Ministers Question Time (when David Cameron, the Tory leader, said Blair should be evicted from the House). She said she was intrigued by the occasion and said Blair had shown a sense of humour with his answers. I have never been to the Lok Sabha and I have come to the House of Commons. 

 Shilpa was invited to the Commons by Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, who said: She went to the members dining room. She met Tessa Jowell (culture secretary), who has given her a gift. The Prime Minister has given her a gift, signed by himself and Mrs (Cherie) Blair, a portrait of the House of Commons; she has had lunch she had smoked salmon (good humoured shouts of oh, stop it, from Shilpa) followed by dessert, Shilpas Delight, which was a selection of English desserts.

 One suggestion she knocked down firmly was the idea, mooted by Vinod Khanna, that she would join the BJP. 

 She told The Telegraph: Oh, not at all. I have never really been politically-inclined. I dont know where this comes from (Vinod Khanna, she was told). No, its very kind of him. I know him personally but nobody has spoken to me about joining any party and I dont intend to do so, not in the near future.

 Summing up her day at Westminster, she said: I thought it would be really boring actually but I really enjoyed it. I was pleasantly surprised. 

 Vazs nine-year-old daughter, Anjali, placed a traditional garland around the two guests before Shilpa posed for pictures. 

 Asked what she thought was the main difference between the House of Commons and Big Brother House, she replied: I think the main difference is that they were more polite in there (the Commons) and I dont get a chance to stay. She would be returning to India shortly as she really missed members of her family but would be returning to the UK to continue her AIDs charity work.

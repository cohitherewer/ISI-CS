 The fading S stamp

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 New Delhi, May 16: As the UPA regime gets set to complete three years in office, Sonia Gandhis stamp seems to be fading.

 There has been no major policy initiative or political achievement to boast of in the last year, leaving the Manmohan Singh government in no mood to celebrate its third anniversary. There will be no report card, no performance appraisal or ratings of individual ministries and ministers. 

 The Prime Minister will, however, have a customary meal with the UPA allies and the council of ministers.

 Sources at the Centre and in the Congress link the governments poor record to Sonias absence from the National Advisory Council (NAC).

 The Congress president had resigned as NAC chairperson on March 23, 2006, following the office of profit row.

 The move proved costly for the Manmohan government, which has been struggling to come up with fresh social sector initiatives ever since.

 Under her, the NAC was an effective interface between civil society and those implementing the National Common Minimum Programme. Moreover, through the NAC, the government had gained access to professionals, research organisations, NGOs and social action groups.

 But since February 18, 2006 days before Sonia stepped down there has been little or no activity in the NAC. 

 Those familiar with Sonias style of functioning said her exit from the NAC was more significant because of her way of working. In the last three years, she has been careful to avoid interfering with the Manmohan government. There have been several instances where her close aides urged her to be more assertive but she declined. 

 Sonias intervention was sought for accelerating the Kashmir peace process, stemming the right to information file notings controversy and other matters relating to key economic, political and foreign policies. But she desisted from airing her views, fearing that the government would comprehend them as directives. 

 When Bilal Musharraf, the son of Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, called on her with grandmother Zarin, the two insisted that Sonia visit their country as a goodwill gesture. In her inimitable polite, but firm, style, the Congress chief made it clear that the Prime Minister would make the trip first.

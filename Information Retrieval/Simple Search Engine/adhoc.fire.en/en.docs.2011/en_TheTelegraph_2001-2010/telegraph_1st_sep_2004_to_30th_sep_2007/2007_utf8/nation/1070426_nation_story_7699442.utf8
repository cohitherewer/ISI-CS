 Relief for old parent

 New Delhi, April 25 (PTI): A Delhi court today provided interim relief to a 70-year-old-woman who had accused her son of throwing her out of her house after asking her to vacate it. 

 Metropolitan magistrate Nirja Bhatia ordered the accused, Sushil Kapoor, to vacate Krishna Kumaris house in Malkaganj. Kapoor had allegedly occupied his mothers house and earlier threatened to kill her, too.

 In her complaint, Krishna Kumari said her son, who initially lived in Malkaganj, shifted to Pitampura in March 2000. In 2003, Sushil hatched a plan with his wife to occupy her house, she said.

 On November 12, 2006, Sushil, the complaint said, threatened her with dire consequences if she did not allow him to stay in the Malkaganj house.

 Sushil later got possession of the house in January 2007 and then allegedly evicted his mother.

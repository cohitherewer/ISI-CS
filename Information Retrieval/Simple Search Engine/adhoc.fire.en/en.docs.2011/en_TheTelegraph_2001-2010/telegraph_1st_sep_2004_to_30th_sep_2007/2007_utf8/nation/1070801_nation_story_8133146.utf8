The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Pain, no panic, in filmdom

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI AND PRATIM D. GUPTA

July 31: Munnabhai is on hold as Sanjay Dutt tries to find a way out of jail.

 Amid the gloom in the industry today around the six-year jail term, the big question was what happens to the neighbourhood bhai with the heart of gold?

 Inspired by the huge success of Lage Raho Munnabhai the sequel to the hit Munnabhai MBBS which gave the audience Gandhigiri producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra went ahead and shot the trailer to the third part in the series, Munnabhai Chale Amerika.

 Shooting, however, hadnt begun.

 Director Rajkumar Hirani had told The Telegraph: I want to make another movie before returning to the Munna series. He is now adapting Chetan Bhagats bestseller Five Point Someone. No, Sanjay does not feature in the film about three IIT students.

 Its an ongoing nightmare. There seems to be no relief, said director Mahesh Bhatt, as several others in Bollywood also spoke up for the actor.

Trade analysts say there is about Rs 80-100 crore riding on Sanjay at the moment. This only includes the films which are either due for release or partly complete. Most of Sanjays work is believed to be complete. In fact, he shot extensively during the last few months to complete his work in the ongoing projects. So there will be minimal losses, said top film distributor G.D. Mehta.

 But Taran Adarsh, editor of Trade Guide, said: His sentencing is a definite setback for directors like Sanjay Gadhvi, Abbas-Mastan and Rajkumar Hirani, who have major projects planned with him.

 Although there are worries about the fate of projects on the floor, there is no panic in the industry about the box office results of forthcoming releases Dhamaal and Dus Kahaniya, which are near completion. 

 The fact is since the Tada court began the process of delivering justice in the case, Sanjays releases have shown that he has a roaring fan following and his films do well at the box-office despite all, said a filmmaker close to Sanjay.

 The sentence may, in fact, gross a bigger opening at the marquee than expected. 

 His last release Shootout at Lokhandwala, based on an encounter between Dawood Ibrahim aides and Mumbai police in 1991, did good business. 

 Among the projects on the floor are friend Sanjay Guptas Woodstock Villa and Alibaug.

 Then there is Abbas-Mastans Mr Fraud. Sanjays legal troubles created a bit of confusion about the fate of the film but a spokesperson for the producers brushed off rumours that the film was shelved, saying it has only got delayed.

 Inder Kumars Dhamaal is in the post-production stage while Sanjay has been shooting non-stop for Sanjay Dhoom Gadhvis Kidnap. 

 We are hopeful he may get bail after a few weeks because of his conduct. He will then be able to finish all his pending projects, said a source at White Feather Films, a production house Sanjay runs with Gupta. 

 Just a couple of weeks ago, the actor was reported to have quit the company after a spat with Gupta over financial matters. But Gupta was today seen sticking by Sanjays family. 

 As the industry appeared to rally around Sanjay, there were some who couldnt help bringing the knives out. The whole issue of Sanjay leaving Guptas production house could all be a drama. It does ensure that Sanjays liabilities as a jailbird dont affect the image of White Feather Films in any way, a top producer said. 

 Producers whose films are yet to go on floor are anxious. 

 We may require to either shelve the projects or rework the scripts. But I believe he may be out on bail for some time. The professional that he is, he will work overtime to finish the projects at hand. We can only hope for the best, said Sanjays filmmaker friend.

 The actors films are usually made on a budget of Rs 15 to Rs 20 crore and usually make moderate box office collections. He works with a limited group of producers and filmmakers who are also his personal friends.

 Mumbai, April 11: Gopinath Munde today told a court that Pramod Mahajans younger brother Praveen had sent him a veiled SMS threat through a Hindi poem, days before shooting the BJP leader.

 The revelation by Munde, who is Pramod Mahajans brother-in-law, came a day after the slain BJP leaders widow, Rekha, told the court that Praveen had demanded Rs 1 crore from his eldest brother.

 Deposing as the second prosecution witness at the additional sessions court, Munde said Pramod Mahajan had got the text message a few days before being shot, but after the demand for Rs 1 crore.

 Now, there will be no more prayers or pleas. Now, there will be war and there will either be victory or an end to it all... Munde said, quoting the text message in Hindi.

 Rekha yesterday said Praveen had visited their Worli home eight or 10 days before he shot Pramod Mahajan and demanded Rs 1 crore. 

 She said Praveen had threatened the BJP leader with dire consequences when he said he could not pay such a huge sum.

 Munde said that Pramod Mahajan, intrigued by the tone of the text message, had shown it to him and asked him to speak to Praveen. 

 Munde spoke to Praveen the same day, but was told to stay out of the matter between the brothers.

 As soon as Munde made the revelation, special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam pointed out that this detail had not come up during police investigation. 

 Nikam asked the court to defer the recording of Mundes statement so the police could verify the claim. 

 Mundes testimony is likely to continue tomorrow.

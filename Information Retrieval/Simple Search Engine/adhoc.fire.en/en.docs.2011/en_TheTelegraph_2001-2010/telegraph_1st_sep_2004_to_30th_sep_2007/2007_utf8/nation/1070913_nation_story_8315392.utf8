 Orissa valley on worlds dirty list

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Sept. 13: Sukinda valley in Orissas Jajpur is one of the most polluted places in the world, according to a report by the US-based Blacksmith Institute. 

 The institute provides solutions to pollution-related problems.

 From India, Sukinda has ranked fourth and Vapi, a 400km industrial belt in Gujarat, is fifth on the list of 10 most polluted places.

 The valley, about 140km from here, is spread across Dhenkanal and Jajpur districts and has the largest chrome ore deposit in the country -- 97 per cent of Indias reserves. Mining is done by the opencast method.

 According to the report, 12 mines continue to operate without any environmental management plans and over 30 million tonnes of waste rock are spread over the surrounding areas. The mines discharge untreated water into the river. This area is also flood-prone, resulting in further contamination of the waterways. 

 The problem is beyond the means of the state to solve.

 Environmentalists said the report is damning evidence of the impact rampant mining has on Orissa.

 Biswajit Mohanty of Wildlife Society of Orissa said the government, in its eagerness to please the mining lobby, has opened up sanctuaries, like Hadagada in Keonjhar, to companies.However, chairman of Orissa State Pollution Control Board L.N. Patnaik described the report as silly. I see a lot of personal agenda behind the report. It is a design to stop mining activities. If there is mining, there would be some air pollution. But to say that Sukinda is one of worst polluted places in the world is ridiculous, he said.

 Army repeats oath of honour

 Indian Army Officers Honour Code

 New Delhi, April 20: Top generals of the Indian Army today concluded the first of their conferences for this year by retaking the oath inscribed in the officers honour code and said it needs to be imbibed better an unusual practice that confirms army headquarters concern about declining values.

 Led by army chief General Joginder Jaswant Singh, the commanders felt the honour code was being observed in the breach in several instances and needs to be re-emphasised.

 The commanders conference the first of two for the year follows a string of discomfiting soldier suicides, fragging (officer killings), and corruption charges against officers. 

 Defence minister A.K. Antony in a ringing note of caution at the inaugural of the conference had advised the officers to observe service with simplicity and take steps to reduce pressures on troops.

 We think there should be a re-emphasis on the honour code, a senior officer said about the discussions. The commanders felt it should be imbibed better and there should be an effort to ensure truthful reporting and moral values and that officers should practise what they preach.

 Officers across the army units in peace and field stations will be asked to explore how to improve the quality of life of troops.

 Last month, Antony tabled in Parliament a list of 25 officers, including eight generals and nine brigadiers, facing charges of corruption. 

 A lieutenant-general indicted for irregularities in procurement of dry rations is likely to be the first officer with such a senior rank to face disciplinary action. 

 Last week, the army began court martial hearings against a lady officer for the first time. She is alleged to have been corrupt while she was a judge advocate.

 The army and Antony have been equally concerned about the rising number of soldier suicides. Before the commanders conference this week to re-emphasise the honour code, there were 20 soldier suicides reported in January and February twice the number of soldiers killed in action. 

 The honour code of Indian Army officers was phrased by Field Marshal Sir Philip Chetwode, commander-in-chief for India of the British from 1930 to 1935. He composed it at the inaugural of the Indian Military Academy, Dehra Dun, in 1932. 

 Cadets swear allegiance to the code as they are commissioned as officers in the army.

 Katara aide sings 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, April 26: Trafficking suspect Rajinder Kumar Gampa today said Bahujan Samaj Party MPs Ashok Rawat and Mitrasen Yadav were in regular touch with his sister, a make-up artiste who trained illegal emigrants caught with Babubhai Katara.

 Gampa, who is Kataras secretary, and his sister Kiran Dhar also in the police net are both believed to have assisted illegal emigrants in impersonation. 

 Gampas statement made in a Delhi court comes days after another suspect, Sunderlal Yadav, named four MPs other than Katara as being involved in the racket.

 The statement suggests the MPs (Yadav and Rawat) knew more about the racket than they are letting on, deputy commissioner of police (crime branch) Neeraj Thakur said this afternoon.

 BJP MP Katara was arrested with a woman and a teenager, who were travelling out of India under the passports of his wife and son, last Wednesday.

 Delhi police sources said they were almost sure of the involvement of another MP A. Narendra of the Telengana Rashtra Samiti. 

 Late this evening, the police found a hard disc of a computer that was allegedly used by Gampa and his sister to forge passports. Once she came to know about Kataras arrest, Kiran hid the hard disc in a house where she would meet Gampa for some of the forgery work, an official said.

 Thakur said the police had no immediate plans of arresting the MPs named either by Sunderlal or Gampa, but expected them to cooperate in investigations. 

 Delhi police have written to five airlines Indian, Air-India, Northwest Airlines, Austrian Airlines and British Airways seeking travel details of the MPs named in the case. However, the airlines had not responded till late evening, sources said. 

 A Delhi police team took Katara to Gujarat today to investigate the possible involvement of BJP officials and workers known to be close to him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 N-stink in brakes on new airport

 OUR BUREAU

 Bhattacharjee and Patel

 Calcutta, Sept. 8: One of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees ambitious projects may have been an indirect casualty of the Congress-Left spat on the nuclear deal.

 If Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel was silent yesterday on the chief ministers desire for a second airport in Calcutta, it had more to do with the larger political scenario than the proposal itself.

 It seemed to suggest that while the good equation between Bhattacharjee and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had helped Bengals development projects, the tiff over the US nuclear deal could see the relations cool.

 Bhattacharjee has repeatedly pleaded for a second airport in the city and was also instrumental in persuading his party, the CPM, to accept private participation in greenfield airport projects.

 In his scheme of things, a new airport was part of a new infrastructure network that would include the Barasat-Raichak expressway, the river port at Kulpi and extend to the proposed chemical hub near Haldia. 

 Officially, though, neither side will link Patels silence on the second airport to the din over the deal. But Patels refusal to answer a query on this suggests a hardening of attitude on the Centres part. 

 The official position, state government and civil aviation ministry sources said, was that there was no question of the Centre turning down the chief ministers proposal because the Bengal government has not yet put it up before the ministry.

 We are still not against a second airport in Calcutta, but there is no need to start work on it from today, a top civil aviation ministry official said in Delhi.

 The ministrys position was explained to the parliamentary standing committee on transport, headed by CPM leader Sitaram Yechury. That is, perhaps, why the Bengal government did not proceed with the proposal put forward by Consulting Engineering Services. 

 The study by the CES and the UKs Institute of Civil Engineers said a new airport should be ready by 2015 because by 2019-20, Calcutta will be handling about 40 million passengers a year.

 The proposal was discussed with us informally but never sent to us formally and we believe it has been shelved for the time being, a ministry official said. 

 CPM central committee member Nilotpal Basu echoed the official. Its still at the level of a concept. Theres no proposal as yet. Our plan is to put up a concrete proposal as we near the completion of the modernisation of the existing airport, he said.

 Asked if Patels silence on the second airport had anything to do with the storm over the nuclear deal, Basu said: So far, there are no such signals. If we get them, well protest.

 What Basu or anyone else will not say on record is that the Bengal government may not henceforth get the same treatment from the Centre. It is not that Delhi will not give the state its due. But a nod from the Prime Minister or a special message from the PMO, that could have speeded things up, may not be as forthcoming as before.

 Marriage site gets stick

 New Delhi, April 11 (PTI): The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission has asked bharatmatrimony.com not to advertise its success. 

 The site had last year claimed it arranged 1,942 marriages between 1999 and 2006 and facilitated 7 lakh more. It advertised it had eight times more success stories than its nearest rival, which was objected to by competitor shaadi.com. 

 It is a fit case that the respondent is restrained from making claims through press/ insertions on its website or by any other manner of its success stories, the panel said.

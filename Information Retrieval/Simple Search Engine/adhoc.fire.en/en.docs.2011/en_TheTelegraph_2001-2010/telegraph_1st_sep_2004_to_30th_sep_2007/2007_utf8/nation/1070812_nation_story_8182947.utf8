 Movie hopes ride on offbeat rally

 Few film producers want to soft-pedal on promotions these days, when pre-release hype often influences success.

 But the makers of Thottal Poo Malarun decided to go the extra mile in their marketing blitz in July on bicycles.

 Kollywood, as Chennais film industry is called, had not quite seen such a spectacle: scores of cheerleaders in whites pedalling on festooned cycles amid a burst of confetti and balloons. 

 Director P. Vasu and Sakthi the hero who is touted as Tamil cinemas new heartthrob were part of the glamourous entourage.

 But they were not the biggest attention-grabbers. That distinction went to a more familiar face: Kushboo. The actress who had ruffled feathers in 2005 with her remarks on premarital sex flagged off the unique rally. 

 Hercules, the bicycle brand, lent its name to the event, hoping to ride on the movies publicity campaign. 

 The modern-day marketing drill glided through a bit of history, too. Gemini Parsan Complex, where the roadshow began, housed the once-famous Gemini Studios, where some of Satyajit Rays early films were processed.

 Plot thickens around Ramoji

 A new plot is unfolding in Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys campaign against media baron and Telugu Desam supporter Ramoji Rao.

 The Congress government has succeeded in taking away 32 acres from Ramoji Film City, an entertainment park set up by Rao on the outskirts of Hyderabad. The district administration took possession of the plots last week. 

 The land was found to be registered in the name of Ushakiran Movies, owned by Rao. 

 The seizure was part of the governments drive to recover land held in violation of laws. 

 We served notices on the firm (Ushakiran) in January, said deputy collector Rama Mani, who led the recovery effort.

 The prime land held by the Ramoji group newspaper next to the complex has already been taken away. Such was the papers clout that the civic body had not mustered the courage to send it a notice during the Desam regime. 

 Fear of the familiar

 All Vimal Pawar knows when she is awake is fear from her ex-husband. The number that the 73-year-old is always ready to dial from her cellphone is that of the police.

 She has reasons to. Her abusive husband Ramchandra, 78, is out of a city jail, where he was serving time for violating a court order that gave Vimal possession of their flat. 

 The septuagenarian lady had won control of the house after a decade-long legal battle.

 A family court had sentenced Ramchandra, a retired sub-inspector, to a month in jail after he sold the flat for Rs 15 lakh despite the orders that gave his wife the ownership. Ramchandra had defied a previous court directive, too, preventing Vimal from entering their house.

 The buyer was asked to clear out the flat, which is now in the possession of Vimal, but she fears a retaliation. 

 The children, one of whom is a lawyer, are not on talking terms with their father because of his abusive nature.

 Price punch

 Delhi got a taste of waterlogging last week. Around the same time, the citizens had to swallow a milk price hike.

 The increase of Re 1 per litre has been made by most dairy cooperatives, including Mother Dairy, Amul and Delhi Milk Scheme. The rise was blamed on higher costs.

 The burden will not end at costlier milk: paneer, butter, curd and other derivatives will be dearer, too. That is worrying households, already having to pay more for essentials like vegetables, pulses, wheat and oil.

 Delhi: Watch Samuel Becketts Waiting for Godot adapted in Hindi at the India Habitat Centre, not far from city centre Connaught Circus, on Sunday. The 90-minute play, which is presented by Bela Theatre, starts at 7pm. Tickets are available at the centre.

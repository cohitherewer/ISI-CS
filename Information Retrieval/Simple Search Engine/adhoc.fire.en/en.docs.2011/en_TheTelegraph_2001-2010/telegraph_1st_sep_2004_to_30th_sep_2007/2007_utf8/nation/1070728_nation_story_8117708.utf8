 20 Kirans make the cut

 - Record number of women in a police academy batch 

 NISHIT DHOLABHAI

 Kiran Bedi

 New Delhi, July 27: Kiran Bedi may have lost out on the top job in Delhi police, but the government could point to a batch of 20 women IPS probationers to blunt her gender bias charge.

 The group of women, the largest ever in a single batch of officers picked in a year, will graduate in September from the Hyderabad-based National Police Academy at a programme marking the culmination of its diamond jubilee celebrations.

 Home ministry officials, justifying the decision to name Y.S. Dadwal as Delhi police chief despite the fact that he is two years junior to Bedi, are expected to argue that there are enough women in the service to deflect her accusations that they are passed over for top posts.

 Yesterday, they had defended Dadwals appointment on technical grounds. The decision is technically and legally correct, a senior home ministry official said.

 As Bedi, best known for her Tihar jail reforms, proceeded on protest-leave, the ministry crafted its line of defence amid an outcry in her favour. The suspicion is that she will move court. 

 Ministry officials have argued that Bedi, on central deputation to the Bureau of Police Research and Development, a central government organisation, cannot technically question the decision in favour of Dadwal, a 1974-batch officer.

 Senior officials in the ministry are peeved at the way Bedi has gone public with her accusations. 

 She has been quoted as saying that she didnt get the post because, unlike many others, she was not part of the party circuit. The remarks have embarrassed senior officers, many of whom are believed to have taken it as a personal insult. 

 A ministry official said those in uniform must understand the value of discipline, which does not have any place for such public outbursts.

 Bedi has contended that an IPS officer is eligible for promotion in the parent state Delhi in this case even while on deputation. 

 But behind the arguments, there is a possibility that the matter will end up in a law court. Bedi herself hinted as much when she said: As I have said, all options are open.

 But the ministry has countered the argument by saying that as director-general of police in the central government (the police bureau), Bedi does not have the right to protest if she has been superseded in her parent state. 

 She is no more in the state government. Only recently, a gentleman not as well known as her was superseded in his parent state as chief secretary but he could not do anything, the official said.

 While the Centre might be unhappy with Bedi, the probationers in Hyderabad might be quietly admiring Bedis never-say-die attitude.

 There is one area where the probationers are showing signs of Bedis spirit and her resolve to march on: none of them have fainted during the long parades at the academy.

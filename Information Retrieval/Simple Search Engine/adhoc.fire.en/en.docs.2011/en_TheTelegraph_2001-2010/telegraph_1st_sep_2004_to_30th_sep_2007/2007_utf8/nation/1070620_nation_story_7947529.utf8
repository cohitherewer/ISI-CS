 Two holes in Ottavio case

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 19: The CBI is looking for holes in the Argentine lower courts judgment in the Ottavio Quattrocchi extradition case to challenge it in the Buenos Aires Supreme Court. 

 The CBI feels there are some elements in the judgment that leave scope for re-evaluation. First, the court struck down Quattrocchis attempts to prove that the case against him was politically motivated, said an official. 

 Second, the court felt the charge of conspiracy to cheat against Quattrocchi holds substance under Argentine laws.

 But the CBIs problem now is that when the Supreme Court takes up the appeal in Buenos Aires, it will not be able to re-argue the case. 

 According to the rules, only the documents about the El Dorado court proceedings can be placed before the judge. After going through them, the Supreme Court will decide if the judgment was correct.

 The CBI is drawing solace from the fact that the El Dorado court rejected its plea to extradite the Bofors accused merely on technical grounds. 

 The judge had said the arrest warrant issued by the Indian court seeking detention of the accused did not have details on the charges against him. 

 Under Argentine laws, a court has to give details about the reasons for seeking the detention in the arrest warrant.

 A CBI source said the ball was in the Centres court on the decision to file the appeal. But even as it awaits orders, the agency is trying to put up a brave face after failing to get the Italian businessman extradited. 

 The appeal against the lower court order automatically goes to the Supreme Court unless it is withdrawn. 

 The challenger gets five working days to prepare a case. The five days for the CBI end tomorrow.

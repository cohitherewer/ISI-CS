 Delhi push to dust riot report

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 5: The Maharashtra government is under pressure to implement the recommendations of the Srikrishna panel, which probed the attacks on Muslims in Mumbai after the Babri Masjid demolition 14 years ago.

 The report has been gathering dust since Justice B.N. Srikrishna submitted it in February 1998. The riots were allegedly led by BJP and Shiv Sena activists, as well as police, during December 1992 and January 1993.

 The sentencing in the 1993 serial blasts which followed the riots and the conviction of al Umma founder S.A. Basha for the 1998 Coimbatore explosions have acted as a catalyst to correct the perception that Muslims were punished while the Hindu perpetrators of communal crimes went scot-free.

 The Congress high command is believed to be keen to ensure that such a perception does not gain ground. This view is shared by Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, said a Congress source.

 Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has been directed to dust the nine-year-old report and determine which of the recommendations could be put into play by his government, in which the Nationalist Congress Party is a partner.

 Congress sources concede Deshmukh can do nothing on his own because home minister R.R. Patil, from the NCP, is unprepared to take the chief ministers orders.

 However, NCP sources said they are also keen to shed the soft Hindutva tag that has stuck on to party chief Sharad Pawar largely because he was seen as being indulgent towards the Maratha-dominated police force of Maharashtra. The Marathas form the NCPs political backbone.

 Two weeks ago, Muslim lawyers and community leaders called on Pawar in Mumbai and complained about institutional prejudice. 

 They pointed out that despite the Srikrishna report nailing the polices lies in two big cases of violence against Muslims in the city the Suleiman Bakery killings and the Hari Masjid firing the FIRs were not revised. As a result, the culprits are roaming free. They also asked why the action-taken report filed by the BJP-Shiv Sena government that rejected the findings of the Srikrishna commission was not scrapped.

 The Centre is anxious to act on the report for several reasons.

 One, the Left wants quick results. CPM leader Sitaram Yechury wrote in a recent newspaper article about the need for complete justice. 

 Two, the Samajwadi Party has taken the lead in banding together Muslim clerics and citizens groups for a protest in Mumbai on August 20. 

 Three, the Supreme Court has sought details of the governments alleged lapses in acting against those involved in the anti-Muslim violence.

 Four, there is a fear that the problems in Maharashtra could affect Muslims across the country.

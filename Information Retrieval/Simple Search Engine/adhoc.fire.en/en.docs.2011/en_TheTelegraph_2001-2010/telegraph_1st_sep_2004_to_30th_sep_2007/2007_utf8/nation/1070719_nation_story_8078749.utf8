 Trip to Dhaka, hilsa in mind

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Ramesh: Ban fighter

 New Delhi, July 18: For palates sake, spare the hilsa.

 Thats the message Jairam Ramesh is expected to convey to Bangladesh, now in the grip of internal unrest, when the minister of state for commerce reaches Dhaka this Saturday.

 The army-backed caretaker government in Bangladesh has banned export of the fish, a delicacy, for six months from July, and sources said a request to lift the embargo is on top of the ministers agenda.

 After all, the hilsa from the Padma a favourite of fish-lovers, especially Bengalis cant be held hostage to human politics, can it?

 Dhaka had enforced the ban on the fish, ostensibly because of a steep rise in its price in the domestic market.

 Trade analysts have compared the hilsa crisis with that of pulses in India. When prices of the various pulses shot up last year and stocks started to disappear because of suspected forward trading, India had stopped sending consignments outside in the hope that the prices would level off in local markets.

 But contrary to what the Bangladesh media had speculated that India might suspend rice exports Jairam has made it clear there would be no tit-for-tat response. India, the sources said, is keen on bringing its trade relations with Bangladesh on an even keel and thats what Jairams visit is all about.

 Subject to clearance from the Prime Ministers Office the external affairs ministry has already okayed the trip Jairam will inaugurate the first India-Bangladesh chamber of commerce and industry in Dhaka on July 22.

 The idea had been germinating for over a year but a source close to Jairam said there was not a moments rethink despite the political shifts. Both countries are serious about it. We cant be fundamentalist in matters of trade and commerce and subject each and every thing to political vagaries, a source added.

 The concept of an industry chamber originated from the realisation that it was, perhaps, not such a good idea to ban foreign direct investments from Bangladesh. Pakistan and Bangladesh are the only two countries off Indias FDI list despite the covert acknowledgement that there was much to gain by revoking it.

 We are keen for India to invest in Bangladesh. The Tatas wanted to put in $3 billion. Its time we changed our mindset and facilitate exports from Bangladesh, the source said.

 Bangalore, July 7: Kafeel Ahmed was living and working in Bangalore till about a month before the failed London and Glasgow attacks, a lawyer engaged by his family said today.

 Mohammed Javed said Kafeel had taken a break from his studies in the UK from last December till May and come to Bangalore.

 He worked with a Bangalore-based company as a senior engineer for four months in this period, but I cannot recall the companys name, he added.

 Kafeel, who was doing his PhD in computational fluid dynamics, is fighting for his life with 90 per cent burns after ramming a car bomb into the Glasgow airport terminal on June 30.

 Javed said Kafeels mother didnt ask about him at all when his younger brother Sabeel, a doctor working near Liverpool, was allowed a lone phone call to Bangalore before being taken into custody as a suspect.

 Dr Zakia later continued to be silent about Kafeel although she stoutly defended Sabeel.

 She and daughter Sadia, an MBBS student, were questioned by the Research and Analysis Wing yesterday. Her husband, Dr Maqbool Ahmed, is suffering from Alzheimers, Javed said. He is delirious. There was no point talking to him.

 The police have seized from the Ahmed home a computer and hard discs they believe may have been used by Kafeel and Sabeel. The cyber crime cell is going through the emails, Orkut scraps (entries), Internet chats and other data files, an officer said.

 The police today questioned Firdous, the wife of Mohammed Haneef, an Indian doctor held in Australia in connection with the UK car bomb plots. The tension has led Haneefs younger brother Shoaib to skip his final-year engineering exams, which began on July 2. I shall take the supplementary exams in October, the shy young man said.

 Asian Nato in water wargames

 SUJAN DUTTA 

 New Delhi, July 12: India will host the largest joint navies wargames in its waters this September in a move that revives speculation that a military alliance with shades of an Asian Nato against China is in the making. 

 But the defence minister of Australia, one of the countries that will be sending a naval contingent, Brendan Nelson, has said during his visit here this week that Canberra was not willing yet to include New Delhi in a strategic dialogue partnership. 

 The wargames, likely to be held off the east coast in the Bay of Bengal, will see contingents from Japan, Singapore and the US, apart from those of Australia and India. This is the second time in the year that India will be participating in a multilateral naval drill with the US. In April, an Indian flotilla participated in wargames off Japan with the US and Japanese navies. 

 Navy sources in Delhi said the September drill was likely to be a continuation of the Malabar series of exercises that India has been engaged in with the US Navy since military-to-military ties were revived in 2002. In previous drills, the US Navy has participated with a Canadian vessel embedded in its contingent. 

 Last year, the defence ministry had advised the armed forces to engage in more multi-nation exercises to remove the impression that India was pursuing military relations with the US at the cost of its ties with other countries.

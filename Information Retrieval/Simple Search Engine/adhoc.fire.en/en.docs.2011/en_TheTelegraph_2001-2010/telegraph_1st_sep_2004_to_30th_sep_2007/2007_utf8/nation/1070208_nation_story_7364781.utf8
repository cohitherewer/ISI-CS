The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Research bond with EU

 Annette Schavan, Kapil Sibal: Partners in science

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: India and the European Union (EU) today signalled the start of a new era of science and technology partnership that for the first time will see joint funding of projects and sharing of research benefits. 

 While India has become the first nation outside the EU to be engaged by it in a science strategy dialogue, discussions at an India-EU ministerial science conference here may also help India emerge an equal partner in selected projects.

 A communiqu issued at the conference has underlined the need for joint or coordinated research proposals in strategically important areas and joint funding and sharing of benefits. Ministers and science policy makers from 27 countries attended the meeting. 

 We expect to see shared funding and shared intellectual property, said Kapil Sibal, Indias science and technology minister. I would call this a dramatic shift from our previous modes of international collaboration, he said. 

 India has committed 5 million euros each year for collaborative projects, Sibal said. The meeting comes at a time when EU has launched a new research framework programme, pledging up to 54 billion euros for the period 2007-13. This money will be open to non-EU collaborators. 

 India is the first non-European partner with whom were discussing (science) strategies, Annette Schavan, the German minister for education and research, told The Telegraph in an interview. 

 We feel there is a dynamism in Indian science and research and were looking forward to more cooperation, Schavan said after the conference, the first ever held by EU science ministers outside Europe. 

 In future, we do hope to establish similar relationships with other countries, but India will remain special for us, Schavan said. 

 At the conference, India and the EU also formalised Indias role in an ambitious physics project in Europe called the Facility for Antiproton Ion Research, where scientists hope to create and study exotic matter. Researchers at the Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre and the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in Calcutta will participate in this project. 

 Indian officials said equal partnership will be a significantly different way of collaborating in science. 

 Until now, almost all collaborative programmes allowed Indian scientists to participate in projects identified in Europe. The collaboration would pay for the scientist to work on certain aspects of the project either in India or in Europe develop joint research publications, and gain knowledge and experience. 

 Under the new paradigm, we may be able to pick our own priority projects and entice European scientists to join us for shared benefits, a senior department of science and technology official said. 

 Indian and EU science officials have identified energy, environment, climate change, health and biotechnology among areas of shared concern where joint research projects are likely to be developed.

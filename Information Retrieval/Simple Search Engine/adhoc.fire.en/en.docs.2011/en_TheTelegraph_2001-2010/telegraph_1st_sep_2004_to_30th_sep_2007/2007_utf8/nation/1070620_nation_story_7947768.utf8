 In giving too, SRK betters Bachchan

 ANANYA SENGUPTA

Mumbai, June 19: Brand Bollywood is going places, and the taxmen are not complaining.

 Going by recent tax collections, Shah Rukh Khan is the most successful salesman in the film industry. Last year, King Khan earned Rs 50 crore from endorsements alone and paid a service tax of Rs 4.8 crore. Amitabh Bachchan paid Rs 1.5 crore. 

 Khan, who is even more in demand this year after the huge success of STAR Pluss Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC), endorsed products as diverse as automobiles, biscuits, garments, computers, watches and talcum powder, not to mention social causes such as the pulse polio and AIDS control programmes. 

 AdEx India, in its Celebrity Track analysis, says the actors basket of endorsements expanded to 21 products in 2005 from 13 in 2004, a 62 per cent jump. 

 In the first quarter of 2006, Shah Rukh endorsed 16 brands, 76 per cent of the number he endorsed in all of 2005. Shah Rukh started endorsing products in 1999 for brands like Pepsi and Hyundai, whose association with him continues to this day. 

 In 2005, the ad spend on brands endorsed by the star was Rs 6.05 crore, AdEx estimates based on market rates reveal.

 Last year was also when Shah Rukh featured in several socially relevant advertisements. His share of such ads vis--vis commercial messages in 2005 rose to 20 per cent from 0.3 per cent the previous year. 

 According to AdEx, the total number of SRK commercials in 2005 rose by 43 per cent to 53,527 commercials from 37,436 in 2004. 

 Bachchan Senior has not been doing badly either. From January to April 2006, the ad spend on Bachchans brands was an impressive Rs 3.49 crore. His face promoted beverages, paints, financial services, garments, automobiles, stationery, food supplements, personal care, real estate, batteries, televisions, chocolates and jewellery. He even had a guest appearance in an ad for the detergent brand Tide, shot while filming Baghban.

 The actor paid Rs 15.59 crore as income-tax, the highest in the industry. With Aishwarya Rai the highest paid actress joining the family, the Bachchans total tax would be around Rs 25.3 crore. 

 Bachchan Junior and Rani Mukerji, the co-star with whom Abhishek has several hits, paid Rs 1 crore each as service tax. With their popularity on the rise, the stars can look forward to signing many more products, say industry insiders. 

 It will be wrong of me to comment on the earnings of these stars and the tax they have to pay because of their endorsements, but I can tell you that each year about Rs 100-120 crore is being spent on celebrity endorsement. However, there is no qualitative data available to understand how celebrity endorsement works, says a senior executive in an advertising agency. 

 John Abraham paid Rs 79 lakh as service tax last year, Sushmita Sen Rs 37.5 lakh, Preity Zinta 27.43 lakh, Salman Khan Rs 13.5 lakh, Malaika Arora Khan Rs 3 lakh and Lara Dutta Rs 2.93 lakh.

 The service tax paid by actors comes under the brand ambassador sector, one of 104 sectors that the central excise collects tax from in Mumbai. 

 With the number of stars who are endorsing products on the rise and newer brands coming to the fore, Bollywood is sure to become a major player as far as tax collections are concerned, says an income-tax official.

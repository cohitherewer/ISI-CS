The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cup won on ground, missing in flight

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, July 12: The Indian team had finally shaken off its losing streak, but that wasnt enough to get its hands on the Future Cup.

 The trophy that saved many a face in the Indian cricket establishment got held up on its way to Mumbai after the failed Glasgow terror attack threw British Airways baggage handling at Heathrow Airport into disarray.

 However, it is expected to land in Mumbai tonight. 

 The trophy was in the custody of PDM Sports, which owned the ground rights for the tournament.

 PDM chief operating officer Roland Lander, who was travelling with the Cup along with two colleagues, said they realised their baggage had not landed when they reached Mumbai. They had taken the Glasgow-London-Mumbai flight on July 5.

 Apart from the Future Cup, the baggage contained Sachin Tendulkars Man of the Series award along with the Man of the Match trophies. There were also 12 souvenir bats that had been autographed by the Indian and South African teams, Lander said.

 A spokesperson for British Airways said the terror attack at Glasgow airport on June 30 had upset the airlines schedules. It caused a four-hour closure, leading to a series of disruptions. We have employed 100 extra volunteers to clear the backlog of delayed bags, she said.

 But the PDM officials complained of tardiness on the part of the airlines in locating their misplaced luggage. We were told there were 9,000 pieces of luggage lying in Heathrow and our baggage was among them, said a PDM source. 

 At least 100 pieces of luggage registered on the London-Mumbai leg of BA 199 did not arrive with the flight and were untraceable for some time.

 There was a delay of more than a week and no one in the airline knew where the baggage was. The four-hour disruption on June 30 at Heathrow because of the Glasgow terror plot is understandable. But this happened on July 5, a week after that. Why did it take another one week for the luggage to be restored? asked a PDM official.

 BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said the Indian team is not a stranger to misplacement of baggage, irrespective of the airline it travels by.

 RK Anand: Blot on boss

 New Delhi, June 3: His fellow lawyers call him boss, to the Congress hes simply RK.

 If R.K. Anand inspired a degree of awe, tinged with scepticism and envy, among the capitals legal eagles for the finesse with which he straddled the space between the bench and the bar, his debut in the Congress in 2001 was no less impressive.

 Leaders such as S. Jaipal Reddy, K. Natwar Singh and Anand Sharma welcomed him into the party at a news conference as a distinguished citizen and an individual of high standing.

 Anand is the son of a businessman who had the sole right to sell Singer sewing machines before 1947. His family moved to Delhi after Partition. 

 Not for nothing did Anand idolise his entrepreneurial father as his hero despite making it to engineering in Pilani, which he junked in two months, and then enrolling for a science degree in Chandigarh, he returned to Delhi to pursue his true calling: law. 

 Anand worked on the grindstone in Tis Hazari, a trial court that nursed many successful criminal lawyers, and moved to the top. He didnt have a chamber and worked out of a shed. This is one reason why nobody can fool me, no munshi, no clerk, he had said in an interview.

 But in a city where every success saga has a political underpinning, Anand was not an exception. The leap forward in his career was in 1980 when the Congress came to power. He defended Indira Gandhi in a legal suit slapped against her by Maneka Gandhi after Sanjay Gandhis death. Anands contention was property was not the issue in this saas-bahu spat because in his own words, Indira gave away her personal wealth generously to family members. 

 Given the Congresss structure, in which even senior leaders find it hard to tiptoe into the Gandhi home, Anands domestic route ensured he had Rajiv Gandhis ears.

 His moment in the limelight really arrived when he extricated P.V. Narasimha Rao from the legal knots he had tied himself in through Lakhubhai Pathak, the JMM bribery case, St Kitts and the Babri Masjid demolition. Anand also defended Raos confidant, Chandraswami, in various cases of Fera violation.

 While the BMW sting may have unofficially made him persona non grata in the legal fraternity, at least for some time, the Congress is yet to take a call on Anand.

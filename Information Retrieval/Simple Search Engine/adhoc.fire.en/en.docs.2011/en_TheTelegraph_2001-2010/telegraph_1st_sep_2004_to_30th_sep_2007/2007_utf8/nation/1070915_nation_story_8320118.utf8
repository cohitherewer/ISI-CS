 Veil off differences in CPM on pullout

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Basu: Majority decision

 Calcutta, Sept. 14: Jyoti Basu today virtually admitted differences in the CPM on whether the Congress should be given a longer rope than what the hardliners are willing to concede. 

 Asked whether Prakash Karats statements over the last few days indicated the inevitability of a snap poll, the CPM patriarch sounded resigned.

 What can I say? Let them (Karat and politburo members from other states) come here. We will discuss the developments in the politburo and subsequent central committee meetings. It is better to have a unanimous decision. Nevertheless, we will go by the majority opinion, he said after the CPM state secretariat meeting today. 

 Basu criticised the UPA government for its stubborn attitude, hoping that the Centre would realise that the majority in Parliament, including the Left parties and the BJP, are opposed to it. 

 The CPMs politburo and central committee will meet in Calcutta for four days from September 28. The politburo venue was shifted from Delhi to Calcutta, apparently to ensure Basus presence as he could not travel to Delhi because of his age. 

 Basu, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state CPM secretary Biman Bose have often played down the possibility of a mid-term poll.

 However, Basu today remained silent on polls. The chief minister, too, continued his weeklong silence on the political standoff in Delhi, though he addressed a Ficci meeting today. 

 Other Bengal leaders like state secretariat member Benoy Konar said the party would not compromise national interest for the sake of state and the CPMs immediate interests. 

 Karat had set the poll clock ticking by saying on Monday that the Left had little time and we have a few weeks to go to the people.

 Yesterday, he made the withdrawal threat more explicit by saying that the Left parties would not be there to help the government conclude this (nuclear) agreement. 

 Party central committee members from Bengal, however, said that key meetings this month were unlikely to take any drastic decision. 

 Since we dont expect any major change in the governments position in September, the politburo and the central committee are not likely to take any decision on withdrawal of support. However, we will take stock of the situation and formulate our position to checkmate the governments possible moves at the International Atomic Energy Agency in November, a party leader said.

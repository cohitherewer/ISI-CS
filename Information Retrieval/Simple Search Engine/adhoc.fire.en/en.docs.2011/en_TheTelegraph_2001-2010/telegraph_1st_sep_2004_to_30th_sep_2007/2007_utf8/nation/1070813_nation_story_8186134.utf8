 Bhopal, Aug. 12: Sisters Rahia, Sana and Anna last evening did what no Muslim woman is known to have done before.

 They acted as gawah or witness to solemnise a nikaah, which happened to be that of a fourth sister, Sadaf.

 In an Islamic marriage, the brides gawah is the key person who stands witness that she has said yes to the proposal.

 The role had always been the sole domain of men. Islamic scholars, however, clarified that there was nothing un-Islamic about women acting as gawah.

 It somehow never happened, said the Bhopal-based Mufti Mahfooz Illahi. But he added: According to the Sharia, their testimony is valued at half a mans. So if two women or adult girls acted as witness, it would meet the norm.

 Naeem-ur-Rahman Siddiqui, an Islamic scholar based in Lucknows Darul-Uloom Nadwa, said he, too, had never come across a nikaah where women or girls had acted as gawah.

 There is nothing that prohibits it. Perhaps it did not happen because of social conditions, he said.

 Now that we have a woman President, women qazis and women imams, its no surprise that Bhopal has had women gawah, too. In any case, Bhopal has had a rich legacy of women nawabs.

 The nikaah took place last evening at the Taj-ul-Masajid mosque, built by Nawab Sultanjahan Begum who ruled Bhopal from 1868 to 1901. 

 The mosque is one of the most magnificent and largest in Asia.

 Bride Sadafs father Sarwar Saeed Khan said he had warmed up to the idea of having his other daughters as gawah when Rahia searched the Internet and told him there was no ban on such a practice.

 I then sounded the grooms side and the qazi. They said they had no problems, Khan said.

 The nikaah is the most important and sacred ceremony in a Muslim wedding. It can be held at the brides house, grooms house or at a place convenient to both families. In Bhopal, most nikaahs take place at mosques.

 The brief ceremony is presided over by the qazi, where one person stands gawah on behalf of the groom and another for the bride.

 After listening to the qazis call, the couple enter into a nikaah in the name of Allah. The two parts of Ijab-e-Qubul proposal and acceptance are usually held at separate places.

 The gawah sign the nikaahnama to complete the ceremony. 

 In the event of a marital dispute, they come into play along with the qazi.

 Groom Amir-ul-Hasan Naqvi was happy to see his sisters-in-law in the first-of-a-kind role.

 The software engineer said: Women are marching ahead in all walks of life. I feel good that in a small way, I have become part of their empowerment.

 Sadaf is a final-year law student in London, and Amir will be moving with her to the UK. Therefore, the bidai ceremony the bride leaving for the grooms house will also witness a role reversal.

 Instead of the tearful bride, it will be the groom saying goodbye to his home and his city. 

 Hopefully, without tears.

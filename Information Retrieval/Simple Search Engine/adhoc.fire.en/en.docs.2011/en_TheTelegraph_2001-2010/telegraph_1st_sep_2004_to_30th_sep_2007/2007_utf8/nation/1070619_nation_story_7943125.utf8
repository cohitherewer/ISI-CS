 Props on offer for Periyar full house

 Periyar will probably not need promos to run to packed houses. And its makers might have a lot to thank the DMK government for.

 The state has announced that school students who want to watch the biopic on the legendary social reformer will get a 50 per cent rebate on tickets.

 And concessions arent the only props being offered. Headmasters and teachers have been advised, informally of course, to make arrangements for children to catch the movie after classes. 

 In the backwaters, where it might not be possible to find theatres, the government is drawing up plans for special screenings. 

 Education experts snigger that getting children to watch the movie amounts to forcing history down their throats. But DMK activists say the aim is to catch them young in spreading Periyars message.

 The debate could be settled either way. But for producers of the film, which stars Sathyaraj and Kushboo, its a huge publicity machine at work. And they arent losing a penny.

 Trash hunters raise a stink

 Young ragpickers of Delhi hit the streets last week with a cycle rally to protest against the governments decision to outsource garbage collection to private companies.

 Our livelihood depends on ragpicking. If the government takes this away from us, we will have to starve, says Raju, a 10-year-old who collects trash from behind the Priya Cinema complex in the upscale Vasant Vihar area. 

 An estimated 60,000 ragpickers clear up as much as 60 per cent of the capitals rubbish, saving the Municipal Corporation of Delhi nearly Rs 10 lakh a day, according to environmental activists. 

 Under an agreement between the civic body and Delhi Waste Management a forum of corporate entities private sector firms will be penalised only if they cant clear even 20 per cent of the daily waste. The green brigade wants this rule to be made more stringent.

 China ho for MLAs

 China still seems to be the most sought-after destination for power players in the Karnataka capital. 

 It doesnt matter that there was a row over an IAS officer from Arunachal Pradesh being denied a visa to visit the country. 

 What has prompted the sudden surge of interest among lawmakers about China is its rapidfire development. The encouragement for the educational tour is coming from none other than Krishna, the Speaker.

 According to Krishna, 250 legislators will travel in batches this year. As it would be a costly affair, the Speaker has suggested that all other tours this year be scrapped. 

 Normally, each legislator is entitled to two domestic and one foreign tour every year. The Speaker felt the visit would give legislators a glimpse of Chinas growth. The external affairs ministry is considering the request.

 Silence of backlash-wary lambs

 New Delhi, July 16: The Congress has begun to wonder whether the government was doing enough to translate into action the Prime Ministers views against labelling and stereotyping religious communities.

 Such doubts have surfaced against the backdrop of the detention of Mohammed Haneef in Brisbane and the perceived reluctance by the Centre to pursue a more proactive role till the facts are clear.

 There is a danger that the Prime Ministers well-intentioned words may be forgotten if the party does nothing to propagate them. I am not suggesting that we should run a campaign because that will provoke a counter-campaign from the Sangh parivar, a Congress leader said.

 Shortly after the bungled plots in Britain, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had spoken of how labelling and stereotyping religions would not help anybody. He also referred to the anguish of the Sikhs when they were dubbed terrorists in the eighties.

 The BJP had criticised him and asked whether his heart bled for the Hindu minorities who left Kashmir.

 Some professionals like lawyers, teachers and government employees personally told me how deeply they resented the Prime Ministers comments. I guess we had no choice but to back off for a while at least, a Congress office-bearer said. 

 Fear of such a backlash may explain the extreme caution with which the government is proceeding on Haneef. 

 Whatever the Prime Minister said is in the right direction but we are not here to take political advantage of his statements, said Congress general secretary B.K. Hari Prasad, who hails from Karnataka.

 However, a Congress Working Committee member said he would call on the Prime Minister this week to find out what could be done on the ground and then ask the party to call a CWC meeting to discuss the stand on such sensitive issues. 

 Congress sources admitted to being disturbed for another reason. It looks like the Indian governing establishment did not take a cue from the Prime Minister. Look how other countries respond if a citizen of theirs is detained on foreign soil. Their consulates move heaven and earth. Here, the establishment was by and large lukewarm to Haneefs detention (in Brisbane), a source said. 

 The instances cited were those of Ottavio Quattrocchi and Warren Anderson, the former chairman of Union Carbide. When Quattrocchi was recently detained in Argentina, the Italian establishment, including politicians and businessmen, drummed up support for him. 

 Anderson was allowed to get away when he came to India soon after the Bhopal gas tragedy of 1984. He was declared a fugitive from justice by the Bhopal court in 1992 for not honouring repeated summons. It was as though there was no action for fear of inviting the USs wrath, the source added.

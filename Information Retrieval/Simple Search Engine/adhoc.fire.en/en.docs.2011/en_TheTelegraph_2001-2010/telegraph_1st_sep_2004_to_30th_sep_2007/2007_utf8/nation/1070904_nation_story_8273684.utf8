 BJPs latest adversary: BJP

 SANJAY K. JHA

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: The BJP leadership, desperate to strengthen and expand alliances across the country, is facing stiff resistance from its own state units in the effort.

 Central leaders are working to sort out the differences within the party as they feel a wider coalition of anti-Congress forces is a must to regain power at the Centre. 

 At a meeting of the partys office-bearers a couple of days ago, leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani argued that the phase of coalitions would continue and the BJP needed to bolster its stock before elections, due in 2009.

 He claimed that the BJP ran the National Democratic Alliance better than the Congress managed its coalition, and cited the nuclear deal standoff as proof.

 Other leaders at the meeting agreed and decided that the party would approach every potential ally and strengthen its alliances.

 The poor showing in the presidential election brought into focus the fissures within the NDA. While the Shiv Sena voted for the UPA-Left nominee, the Trinamul Congress chose to stay aloof. The Janata Dal (Secular), which is sharing power with the BJP in Karnataka, also opted not to vote. 

 Now, amid several hints of early polls, the BJP feels its priority should be to address coalition problems and bring in new partners. The party sees the possibility of a big political realignment before the elections. 

 But the alliance-building job has been made difficult by the partys state units, which appear to be working at cross-purposes with the central leadership.

 The Andhra unit has, for instance, has passed a resolution against any understanding with the Telugu Desam and conveyed to the leaders in Delhi that the party should explore the possibility of aligning with the Telengana Rashtra Samiti.

 The central leaders had counted on the Desam because of its wide reach and its record as an opponent of the Congress, but even they appear to have given up after the formation of the third front, the UNPA.

 Some BJP leaders, though, feel that the UNPA parties can still be approached. For instance, the Asom Gana Parishad in Assam has long been a BJP ally and will gain little being in a coalition with the Samajwadi Party and the Desam.

 In Haryana, the INLD has always been with the BJP but attempts to strengthen ties have run into resistance from local leaders who feel INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala had in the past tried to harm the BJP.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Lalu for daal, roti amp; deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lalu Prasad: Showing the way

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: Lalu Prasad thinks the civilian nuclear deal is one of the best things that could have happened to India.

 The railway minister isnt bothered too much about the details of the treaty. To him, what matters is that along with daal, roti and bhaath, we need infrastructure, power, railways, roads (and) the need to inspire investor confidence because today everyone wants to invest in India.

 The RJD chief spoke the language of the Prime Minister to hard sell the deal. Except that his arguments were made in the common mans language without jargon or circumlocution.

 Look, the Prime Minister of Japan is visiting India because Japan wants to spend its wealth on our country. Our cabinet has cleared the industrial corridor and this means lots of jobs, he told The Telegraph.

 But if we have to increase employment, we need industries and industries need power. At least 20,000 megawatts. This is the best deal our government could have secured without in any way surrendering to the US. China, too, did it 10 years ago.

 Lalu Prasad described the Left as our friends. But he had a message for Prakash Karat and A.B. Bardhan: Dont cut the branch you are sitting on. Nobody knows where you will fall or (whether you will) ever recover from the fall.

 Lalu drew a subtle distinction between being in the Opposition and being part of the ruling coalition.

 I have been a mature ally from the start. There was a time when I did things like have a lathi rally, yaad hain naa (dont you remember)? If there are issues like discrimination against Muslims, these can always be sorted out. Nobodys a kid. Kis bachche ka chacha kah sakta hai ki hamari sarkar desh ke iqbal ke saath khilwaad kar raha hai (who dares accuse our government of playing with the countrys prestige)?

 The world has changed. Being rigid doesnt help anyone. Without the left hand, the right hand is useless. Paralysis will set in. Left and right have to work in unison, Lalu Prasad said.

 Like this, he added, moving his arms in synch. Left, right, left, right, lets all come closer.

 The railway minister suggested that the Left should not for ever close its options with the Congress and the other secular parties.

 If there are elections and a coalition seems inevitable, we have to come together to stop the BJP.

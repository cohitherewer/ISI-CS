 Couple amp; cricket in, poodle missing 

Mrs Nayars Barjatya blast 

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Maharani Suite at Umaid Bhavan Palace

 Jodhpur, March 7: The sequences may be slightly jumbled and the bride may be the ageing former face of Estee Lauder. But it is hard to miss the Sooraj Barjatya movie atmosphere.

 For her Indian wedding, Liz Hurley, with husband Arun Nayar, landed from Mumbai at Jodhpur at 5.40 in the evening, a few hours behind schedule, flanked by Hurleys son Damian and liquor baron Vijay Mallya. They came in a plane of Kingfisher Airlines, a Mallya property. 

 Accompanying them were 200-odd guests from abroad and Mumbai in five other flights. They left immediately for Umaid Bhavan Palace, the property of the former maharaja of Jodhpur, a part of which is now leased to the Taj Group of Hotels, and which the paparazzi are zealously guarding. Hurley has booked a whole hotel for her guests. 

 But Hurley eluded the media while busloads of firang guests whooshed in through the main entrance, a long drive leading to the picturesque walled haveli. Hurley drove in through the back gate and immediately settled down to her mehendi ceremony and some nacha-gana.

 It was followed rapidly by a cricket match Hurley 11 versus Nayar 11. Not much is known about their cricketing skills, but on Hurleys side was her family and friends and on Nayars the larkewale. It is not known what song played.

 Tomorrow morning, they will leave for Ahichhatragarh in Nagaur, about 140 km from Jodhpur, where they will spend the whole day, hosted by the royal family of Nagaur. 

 Lizs wedding reception at Umaid Bhavan, which was to take place tomorrow, will be held a day after as her plans seem a little uncertain. At Naguar, Louiz Banks and Sivamani will perform a medley of jazz, rock and Carnatic music to mix the East and the West.

 A Bollywood wedding made in the UK has been lifted bodily to Jodhpur. The city knows a big shaadi is taking place but between whom it doesnt care. There are the usual Umaid Bhavan artistes, who will perform the traditional Incredible India show in their colourful clothes. But the flowers have been outsourced from the UK.

 As V. Ram, a police official who accompanied Hurleys entourage to the hotel, said: Liz Hurley ka shaadi hai, lekin wo kaun pata nahin. Hoga koi (It is Liz Hurleys wedding, but I dont know who she is. Must be somebody famous).

 The guest list, too, did not leave the viewers bedazzled. There were the usual suspects: Parmeshwar and Adi Godrej, Tanya Dubash, Hasina Jethmalani, Riyad Oomerbhoy and Navas Singhania.

 But no big name from across the seas. No Hugh Grant, no Elton John, no Beckham. No one big from Bollywood either. But its enough to turn Umaid Bhavan into a fortress with three layers of security Hurleys own, the hotels and the local police. And the three-day Rajasthan party just begins for the wedding guests. Tonight they partake of a multi-cuisine feast with Rajasthani specialities like kair, rabori, chakki ka saag and pitori ki sabzi. 

 Another grand Indian wedding. Another grand Indian wedding musical. Only Barjatyas signature poodle is missing.

 - Wheat import controversy and monopoly probe pile heat on Pawar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Game and grain dont 

 mix 

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: Game and grain wont mix, Sharad Pawar is being gently reminded as a controversy over wheat imports and rising food prices brought his dual role under the glare.

 The Left and the Janata Dal (United), an NDA constituent, today attacked the Centre for importing 7.95 lakh tonnes of wheat at a weighted average price of $389.45 a tonne (which works out to about Rs 16 a kg). 

 Their contention was the international farmer would gain at Indias expense because his local counterpart was being paid only half that amount at Rs 8.50 a kg.

 The Left demanded an effective and transparent inquiry into the import. It is an issue of absolute malpractice that should be looked into. We are demanding an appropriate, effective and transparent probe, Gurudas Dasgupta of the CPI told reporters.

 CPMs Brinda Karat had written to the Prime Minister questioning the decision. It is a very important issue but it is difficult to pinpoint blame on anyone. The import was done by the state trading corporation (under the commerce ministry), said Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, the parliamentary affairs minister.

 Lest he was seen as obliquely attacking a Congress minister Kamal Nath in this case Das Munshi quickly added that questions should be addressed to Pawar, the BCCI chairman and then food and agriculture minister. 

 Das Munshis description summed up the feelings of many Congress leaders who felt that Pawar was taking cricket far more seriously than his job at the ministry. But we can do nothing. Hes like a bone stuck in our throats, a Maharashtra Congress MP said.

 The Congresss Maharashtra contingent was upset with Pawar for allegedly doing little to revamp the public distribution system and the micro-credit financing mechanism to help farmers.

 The resentment is being seen as the driving force that ensured a full house of Maharashtra MPs and Congress functionaries at a Parliament lecture delivered by journalist P. Sainath on farmers suicides today.

 Rahul Gandhi and the rest of the youth brigade, too, showed up. So did Pawars daughter and Rajya Sabha MP, Supriya Sule, but a notable absence was that of her father.

 The wheat import decision was approved last Monday by an empowered group of ministers, headed by Pranab Mukherjee.

 The state trading corporation had recommended the bids which were won by three companies: Swiss Glencore, Alfred Toepfer of Germany and Starcom Resources of Singapore. The presence of senior Congress ministers in the group made it hard for the party to shake off responsibility, sources conceded. 

 At the Congress briefing, spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi sought to justify the move, saying long-term contracts were being implemented now. 

 Although Das Munshi maintained that the government will not make an inch of compromise on food security, questions were raised by leaders like Sharad Yadav on why the government imported wheat at Rs 16 a kg when the current open market rate ranged between Rs 10.20 and Rs 12 a kg and the domestic support price was Rs 8.50 a kg.

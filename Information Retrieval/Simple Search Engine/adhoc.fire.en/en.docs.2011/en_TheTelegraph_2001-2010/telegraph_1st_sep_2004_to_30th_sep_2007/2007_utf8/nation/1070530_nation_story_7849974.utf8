 The Pilot familys shaky seat

 Pilot: Focus on development

 New Delhi, May 29: The suave Sachin Pilot does not play sectarian politics but if the Gujjars are reclassified as a Scheduled Tribe, he will be one of the biggest political beneficiaries.

 Sachin is in danger of losing Dausa, his Lok Sabha constituency, as the delimitation commission has recommended that the seat be reserved for Scheduled Tribe candidates.

 If the President eventually accepts the recommendation, Sachin will have to belong to a Scheduled Tribe to contest again from there. 

 But if the Gujjars Sachin belongs to the same community are put on the Scheduled Tribe list, he can continue to stand for elections from Dausa. 

 Sachins father, the late Rajesh Pilot, had nursed Dausa as his political fief, though he hailed from Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh.

 The buzz in the Congress was that Sachin would either return to his roots in Ghaziabad or look at a constituency in Madhya Pradesh where the Gujjars are in a majority.

 The 28-year-old MP, minted from St Stephens College and Wharton, had toured Madhya Pradesh extensively with Digvijay Singh, ostensibly as a counter to the Congresss other young MP from the state, Jyotiraditya Scindia.

 Although Sachin was not directly a party to the Gujjars demand for tribal status, political observers believe the agitation and the killings would give a fillip to his politics by 2009, before which the new delimitation rules are unlikely to come into force. 

 Sachin visits his constituency religiously over weekends but his style gives the impression that he is focused on development and infrastructure-related activities.

 Dausa, after all, is a complex seat and constructing a caste matrix of the Jats, the Gujjars and the Meenas is not easy, as Rajesh Pilot often told journalists. He believed that no serious contestant could afford to antagonise any of these castes.

 Delhi picks up Dhaka signals

 JYOTI MALHOTRA 

 New Delhi, Sept. 4: India is reading as a positive signal Bangladeshs reported arrest of a militant linked to the Hyderabad blasts, but chances of an official confirmation are remote.

 Abu Hamza, a close aide of alleged mastermind Shahid Bilal, has been reportedly picked up by the army-backed government in Bangladesh, though Dhaka has officially frowned on such reports and denied any knowledge of such a detention.

 Sources in Bangladesh said Hamza was caught after Bangladeshi intelligence agencies decided on their own to sweep their own underground for any clues to the blasts. 

 The net was cast without any formal communication from Delhi requesting either information or action, the Bangladeshi sources said. 

 The Bangladeshis have not yet decided what they intend to do with Hamza.

 Indian foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee today side-stepped questions on Hamzas alleged arrest, but sought Bangladeshs cooperation in tackling terrorism.

 In Dhaka, the foreign ministry issued a statement that there have been no arrests in Bangladesh so far in this connection.

 Both the print and electronic media in India are trying to portray Bangladesh as a hotbed of terrorism. Such reports are disturbing and clearly motivated, it added.

 But the army-backed government, acutely sensitive to Indian suggestions that Bangladesh remains a hotbed of cross-border terrorists, wants to send another signal to Delhi that it is keen on opening a new chapter in bilateral relations. 

 The arrest of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia is intended to send a second message: while her erstwhile BNP government may have deliberately taken an anti-Indian position, the new government wants to break with the past. 

 Bangladesh is believed to have kept India informed about its intentions to arrest Khaleda and Sheikh Hasina, another former Prime Minister.

 The army-backed government has insisted that it was only cleansing society.

 Bangladesh army chief Moeen U. Ahmeds visit to India continues to be postponed, ostensibly because of floods there, but also because he wants to remain closely in touch with developments at home. 

 Delhi is also keeping a close eye on the split in Khaledas BNP, which took place hours before she was sent to jail.

 Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, the sacked deputy leader of the BNP, is a former communist who played an active role as a muktijoddha or freedom fighter in Bangladeshs liberation war. Bangladeshi observers are already distinguishing between the old and the new BNP.

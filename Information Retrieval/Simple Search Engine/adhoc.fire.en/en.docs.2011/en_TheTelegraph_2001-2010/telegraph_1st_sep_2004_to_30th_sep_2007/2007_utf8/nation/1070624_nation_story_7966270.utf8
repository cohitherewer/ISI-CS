 Rivals to pals, thanks to the seven sisters

 Ramesh, Aiyar: Rivals then, partners now

 Guwahati, June 23: Politics made them rivals, now geography has brought these seasoned politicians from the south together. 

 After 25 years of flirting with rivalry and smart exchange of words, Mani Shankar Aiyar, the minister for development of northeastern region (DoNER), and minister of state for commerce Jairam Ramesh are friends. 

 Articulate and sometimes displeasing senior cabinet colleagues, but one left of centre the other right respectively, Aiyar and Ramesh noticeably have struck a common chord in and for the Northeast. 

 Apparently, these Congressmen love the seven sisters without any rivalry what- soever. 

 Aiyars trip to Agartala, Guwahati and Shillong this week, along with Thailand commerce minister Krirk-krai Jirapaet, therefore, includes Ramesh. 

 Whereas Aiyar concentrated on microeconomics of the Northeast vis--vis Thai interests, Ramesh focused on the macro aspect and succeeded in bringing a consensus on inclusion of Myanmar and Bangladesh in the development of Southeast Asia, with Indias Northeast a major stakeholder in the process. 

 Today, the DoNER minister introduced his colleague to a large audience of businessmen from Assam and Thailand as my former rival and present partner, Jairam Ramesh. 

 Ironically, not long before both wrote separate columns in magazines with their distinct slants. 

 He (Aiyar) is brilliant, sharp and has ideas so what if some are not accepted, said Ramesh with a smile, the aisle in the ATR aircraft from Agartala to Guwahati still dividing the Right and the Left. 

 Both leaders have made a sustained effort to bring northeastern states into the big league, each in his own way. 

 Since taking over as DoNER minister, Aiyar has worked hard to get Rs 50,000 crore for the region in road development and Rs 10,000 crore for railway works over the next five years. 

 Ramesh came up with the special purpose tea fund to rejuvenate the industry in Assam and has pushed Tripura to being number two in growing rubber. 

 But Jirapaet could be a bone of contention. As Aiyar is insistent on Indo-Thai ties with focus on the Northeast, the commerce ministry may not give bargaining supremacy to the Thai minister especially when the two countries are engaged in hammering out a free trade agreement this week. 

 India has already convinced Thailand to drop rubber from its sensitive list. As the DoNER minister has succeeded in getting Thai businessmen to invest in Tripura, the commerce ministry is suspicious what the shrewd Jirapaet would ask in bargain on the trade agreement.

 We have to be practical, Jirapaet had noted after Aiyar spoke of Indo-Thai products from the Northeast. 

 In any case, there is a sudden surfeit of ideas for the Northeast from the ministers, a veritable pressure group to add to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs Rajya Sabha membership from Assam. 

 The commerce minister addresses Aiyar as a senior colleague. They have reconciled but it was never as bad as they say, claims Ramesh. 

 For all the years, of course, it was the media playing games, they allege.

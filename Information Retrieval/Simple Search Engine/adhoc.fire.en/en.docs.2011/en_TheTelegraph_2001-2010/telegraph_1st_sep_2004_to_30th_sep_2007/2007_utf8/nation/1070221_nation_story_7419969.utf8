 CBI probe into picnic death

 OUR BUREAU

 Ranchi/Giridih, Feb. 20: Casting doubts on the impartiality and competence of police, Jharkhand High Court today ordered a CBI probe into the death by drowning of final-year Birla Institute of Technology student Abhishek Mishra.

 A division bench of Chief Justice M. Karpagavinayagam and Justice Permod Kohli observed it would be better to hand over the probe to the CBI. 

 The circumstances are such that it is reasonable to infer that the police may not be able to discharge their function fairly and impartially, the judges observed.

 Abhishek had drowned in the Dasham falls in December during a picnic with three other friends, including Ragini, daughter of Union railway minister Lalu Prasad.

 While chief minister Madhu Koda had turned down requests for a CBI inquiry, Jharkhand police maintained it was a accident. But the court took cognisance of a letter written by Abhisheks father Dr S.C. Mishra, the chief medical officer of the Delhi-based Ram Manohar Lohia hospital.

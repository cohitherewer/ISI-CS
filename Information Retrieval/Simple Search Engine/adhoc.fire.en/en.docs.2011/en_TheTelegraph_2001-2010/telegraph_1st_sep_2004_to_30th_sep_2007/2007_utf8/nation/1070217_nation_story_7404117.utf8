The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

A ticket to labour room, please

They had their first bus ride when they were still inside their mummies tummy. 

 As the three babies kicked to come out on a bandh day, their mothers screamed in pain and panic. 

 Their families called up an emergency ambulance service, only to see a bus land at their doorsteps within minutes.

 Six hospital specials were being run by the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) on Monday, though it backed the bandh called to protest the Cauvery tribunals final award. 

 Jaya, Krishnaveni and Rajeshwari were taken to the hospitals of their choice and three healthy babies were welcomed to the world, thanks to the buses, grins Dastagir Sharief, the chief traffic manager. 

 Sharief says the six hospital specials were the only buses that operated on the day the bandh slammed the brakes on the city. More than 100 patients and their attendants benefited from the service. 

 The much-maligned BMTC has upped its collar and is patting itself on a job well done.

 Traffic Swamy strikes again

At 74, K.R. Ramaswamy has no time to sit and stare. Especially when hes stuck in a traffic jam. But while most people spill their frustration in words, Ramaswamy believes in action.

 few days ago, he was on the road to court. The cause this time: make helmets mandatory for two-wheeler riders. The Tamil Nadu government then assured the court that helmets would be made compulsory. 

 The government is now planning to cancel licences of those caught riding two-wheelers without helmets for the third time. Helmets would be made mandatory for pillion riders, too.

 Ramaswamy, who used to be a weaving master at PSG Textile Mills in Coimbatore, has been voluntarily regulating traffic since 1987. Then assistant commissioner (traffic) gave Traffic Ramaswamy, as he has been named since, an identity card so that no one questions his authority.

 Gods too need ration

When the government promises cheap rice to ration card holders, even gods or rather their emissaries are tempted to get a taste of the largesse.

 M. Karunanidhis DMK had introduced the Rs 2-a-kg rice scheme after coming back to power in Tamil Nadu. Now, many of the states temples battling funds crunch want the government to issue them ration cards.

 The Poojaris Welfare Association at a meeting on Saturday said financially-weak temples could well do with some cheap rice to offer to deities.

 The deposits kept in banks to help them perform pujas at least once a day, if not thrice as the scriptures say, were generating meagre interests, they complained. 

 The priests also demanded that 40 per cent of the annual income of the bigger and richer temples be earmarked for their poor cousins. 

 Power saver

What happens when the Indian Society of Lighting Engineers meets its European counterpart? It throws some light on streets. 

 At the meeting in Bangalore recently, the engineers decided to save at least 10 per cent of the power that goes into the citys street lights. Showing the engineers the way will be some EU countries, teaching them the European model that helps save power. 

 The meet also threw light on some interesting facts about Bangalores street lights. While residents may claim its an ill-lit city, Bangalore boasts of 1.82 lakh street lights. 

 Of them, 70 per cent have automatic switches so the lights are on at dusk and off at dawn.

Mumbai: Got to be Aishwarya, a Bharat Dabholkar play about a girl looking for her estranged father (played by Tom Alter), who she believes will help her fulfil her Bollywood dreams, will be staged at the NCPA Tata Theatre at Nariman Point on February 17-18 at 6.30 pm.

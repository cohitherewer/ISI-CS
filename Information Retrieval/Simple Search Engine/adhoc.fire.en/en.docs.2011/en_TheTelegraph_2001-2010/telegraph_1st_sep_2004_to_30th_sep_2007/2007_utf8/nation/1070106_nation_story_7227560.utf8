 Soren shift to Dumka

 Jamtara (Jharkhand), Jan. 5 (PTI): Former Union minister Shibu Soren, who appeared before a court here today in connection with the 1975 Chirrudih massacre, will be shifted to Dumka Central Jail.

 The decision to move Soren, which came three hours after he was taken to Jamtara Jail after appearing before the sessions judge, was taken apparently because Jamtara has no central jail, sources said.

 Soren, serving a life term in Tihar Jail for the murder of his secretary Sashinath Jha, was brought here by Delhi police earlier in the day.

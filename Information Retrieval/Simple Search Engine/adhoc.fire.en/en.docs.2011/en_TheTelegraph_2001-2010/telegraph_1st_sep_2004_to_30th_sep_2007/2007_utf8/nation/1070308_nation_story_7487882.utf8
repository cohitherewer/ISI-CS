 Apex court frowns on quota haste

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 7: The Supreme Court today questioned the governments hurry to introduce reservation for other backward classes (OBCs) in central educational institutions without first updating the pre-Independence data on the number of beneficiaries.

 What is this great hurry? Why cant you wait for two years and get proper data? a bench headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat asked while hearing a plea seeking to restrain the government from providing 27 per cent reservation to OBCs from 2007-08. The judges reserved their verdict.

 Is it your stand that since we conducted a caste census in 1931, we do not need any (fresh) data? the court asked additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam as he argued against a stay on enforcing the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006.

 If the act was passed after a proper study, there would have been no problem in allowing you to go ahead. You are relying on data which has lost its efficacy, the judges told Subramaniam.

 The law providing for reservation in educational institutions established, maintained or aided by the Centre was enacted in line with the 93rd Constitutional Amendment, which allows the government to frame such a legislation.

 Six petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the amendment and the subsequent legislation which provides for reservation from the 2007 session have been filed in the Supreme Court.

 With several institutions already announcing OBC quotas from this session, the petitioners requested the court to stay the operation of the act till its validity was decided.

 The government is virtually depending on the 1931 caste census for the number of OBCs, they argued, adding even the Supreme Court verdict on excluding the creamy layer among the backward classes was not being followed.

 Opposing the stay, Subramaniam argued that there were empirical parameters even though they may not be the most perfect. He pointed out that the apex court had approved a list of OBCs entitled to reservation in jobs. 

 The government pointed out that the court had already held caste as a parameter to determine socially and educationally backward classes that need quotas.

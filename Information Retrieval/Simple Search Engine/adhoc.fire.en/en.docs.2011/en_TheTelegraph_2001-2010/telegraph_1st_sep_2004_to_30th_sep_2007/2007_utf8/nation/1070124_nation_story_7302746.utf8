 Home violence law gets a force

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Jan. 23: The Delhi government has hired an all-woman cadre with the full-time job of implementing the domestic violence law, setting an example for other states.

 The 19 protection officers are crucial to the legislations success, for they are meant to help and guide a victim in every way, and their report to the court would largely decide the cases.

 The Delhi government (which has a woman chief minister) has set an example on how to go about applying the act effectively. Most state governments have done nothing, Asmita Basu, of the Lawyers Collective, said.

 The new act leaves it to the state governments to decide how they should appoint the protection officers and how many.

 Usually, the states as seen with the laws against dowry and child marriage delegate such responsibilities as a part-time job to some officials. They are to implement the law, but that is not their only duty. They have a host of other responsibilities. This means they have no time (for implementing the laws), Basu said.

 The protection officers can expect to have their hands full. They must see that there is an immediate end to the violence, get the victim legal help and, if necessary, ensure she finds a shelter.

 So, recruiting the right protection officer is vital, and Delhis department of social welfare, which has hired the women, went about it in a professional way.

 The central welfare board put out an advertisement, saying the applicants had to be women below 35.

 The essential qualifications mentioned were a postgraduate degree in social work or sociology from a recognised university/institution. The desirable conditions included a years practical experience in social work or social welfare activities with any government department or registered NGO.

 The recruits will get a consolidated salary of Rs 10,000. 

 The initial appointment will be on a six-month contract so the officers cannot see the responsibility merely as a stepping stone to a secure government job.

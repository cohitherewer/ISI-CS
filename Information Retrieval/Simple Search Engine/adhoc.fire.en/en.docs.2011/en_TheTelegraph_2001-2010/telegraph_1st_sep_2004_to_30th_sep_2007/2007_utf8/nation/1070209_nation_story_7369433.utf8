 Amar says Bentley his, not ABs 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: Bentley is not for Bunty after all. So said uncle Amar Singh, as he tried to put a lid on the dust the Rs 1.7-crore car has kicked up.

 I have imported this car for my personal use in Mumbai, the Samajwadi Party leader told reporters today.

 The Delhi transport department had pointed out yesterday that while the registration papers mentioned a Delhi address, the application for a transit registration said Singh lives in Jalsa Amitabh Bachchans home in Mumbai.

 Singh said Jalsa has been his home whenever he has visited Mumbai in the last two decades. Let Amitabh Bachchan deny this. I am ready to face the consequences.

 Abhishek had taken fiance Aishwarya for a drive in the Bentley on his 31st birthday, and it was reported the car was a gift from Amitabh. But Singh said his nephew was merely using the car in my absence.

 Bob Woolmer: Mystery deepens

 New Delhi, March 23: As Bob Woolmers death turned into a murder mystery, forensic pathologists said the act of strangulating a man with bare hands may take anywhere from 15 seconds to five minutes.

 Jamaican police, citing a pathologists report, said the Pakistan coachs death was due to asphyxia as a result of manual strangulation.

 Forensic pathologists here, who are familiar with the physiological changes that accompany manual strangulation, said death can occur in seconds to minutes, depending on the intensity of pressure applied and the position of fingers.

 Throttling the forensic term for manual strangulation can lead to death either through asphyxia (a process in which air supply is obstructed) or through a physiological mechanism called vasovagal inhibition in which the heart stops beating almost instantly, doctors said.

 While asphyxia can typically cause death in three to five minutes, vasovagal inhibition can kill even in 10 or 15 seconds, said Anil Aggrawal, professor of forensic medicine at the Maulana Azad Medical College in New Delhi.

 During the act of throttling, the fingers may place intense pressure on a region of a blood vessel in the neck called the carotid sinus which is rich in nerves that control the heart rate. High external pressure on the carotid sinus makes these nerves send a signal to the heart to stop beating, Aggrawal said. Vasovagal inhibition often gives the victim no chance to struggle, he said.

 With Jamaican pathologists reporting asphyxia, the question now is whether Woolmer had time to struggle or could not do so either because there were more than one assailant or because he had been poisoned.

 The toxicology analysis now cant be ignored, said G. Pradeep Kumar, forensic pathologist at the Kasturba Medical College in Manipal who had spent two years as a forensic doctor at the Princess Margaret Hospital in the Bahamas.

 The analysis may provide information about whether some poison or alcohol had been used to disable the victim from struggling, Kumar told The Telegraph. 

 Doctors said the toxicology analysis would also explain the puzzle of blood-stained vomit. Vomiting is not a feature we see in throttling, Kumar said. It has to be explained, and it fits in with poison or alcohol. 

 Forensic scientists said an assailant needs at least the strength of the victim unless the victim has been disabled from resisting with drugs or alcohol.

 In the absence of vasovagal inhibition, the process of asphyxiation will take at least two to three minutes. This allows a person to fight back, said Karpur Nagesh, a forensic pathologist at a medical college in Mangalore.

 Manual strangulation is only one among several methods of murder that can lead to asphyxia. A rope, cord, or even an elbow around the neck, a bamboo stick on the neck, or a pillow on the face can all lead to asphyxiation.

 Mulayam safe, party faces challenge 

 DHIRENDRA K. JHA

 Etawah, April 6: The roads are lined with his posters, banners and flags. But an anti-Samajwadi Party wave is blowing in the face of Mulayam Singh Yadav on his turf.

 As the districts of Etawah, Mainpuri and Auraiya Uttar Pradeshs Yadav bastion go to polls tomorrow, a wide section of the people here feels the wrestler-chief minister is being pinned down by rival Mayavati.

 No one can dispute that Netaji (as Mulayam is popularly known) has completely changed the face of this region. But he has also created everywhere a large number of politician-contractors, most of whom are criminals. He is, therefore, himself responsible for a situation like this, said Jagdish, a paan shop owner in Etawah town.

 Etawah, Mainpuri and Auraiya have 12 constituencies, nine of which have Samajwadi Party MLAs.

 In all but three seats Bhartana, Mulayams constituency, Jaswant Nagar, from where Mulayams brother Shivpal Yadav is contesting, and Auraiya proper the Samajwadi Party is facing an unprecedented challenge from Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party.

 A cloud is looming over Bhartana and Mulayams native village Saifai, too. While the people here have no doubt about the chief ministers victory, a question mark hangs over the fate of the other Samajwadi Party candidates.

 Netaji will certainly win from here, but what about his other MLAs? asked Shri Prasad, who runs a tea stall in Bhartana, one of the four constituencies in Etawah.

 In Ferozabad district, the Samajwadi Party occupied all four seats in the outgoing Assembly. But this time, the BSP has emerged favourite in two of them Ferozabad town and Tundla while a former state minister and Independent candidate, Ashok Yadav, is faring well in Shikohabad. That leaves only Jasrana, where the Samajwadi Party is comfortably placed.

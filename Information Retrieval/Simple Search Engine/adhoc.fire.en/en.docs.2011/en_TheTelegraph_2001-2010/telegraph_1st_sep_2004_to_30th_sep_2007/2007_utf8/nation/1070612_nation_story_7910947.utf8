 Petrol price review

 New Delhi, June 11 (PTI): The government is likely to review in mid-July prices of petrol and diesel, unchanged since February despite a spurt in international rates.

 Once we have the trend for the first quarter (April-June), we will review the situation, a top oil ministry official said.

 In early July, we hope to get a consolidated view after consultations with the industry and the Left parties.

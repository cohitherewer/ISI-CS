 Racist hits make heroine of Shilpa

 AMIT ROY 

 London, Jan. 16: Shilpa Shetty has become the story on Celebrity Big Brother, with 9,600 complaints an unusually high number registered that the Bollywood star has been subjected to alleged racist behaviour by three of her female housemates. 

 Keith Vaz, the Labour MP for Leicester East, a city with a large Indian population, took the controversy up a gear by raising the issue in the House of Commons. 

 He tabled an early day motion which read: This House views with concern the comments made about Big Brother contestant Shilpa Shetty by other housemates; believes that Big Brother has a role to play in preventing racist behaviour in the Big Brother House; regrets that these comments have been made; and calls on the programme to take urgent action to remind housemates that racist behaviour is unacceptable. 

 Vaz explained why he had intervened: I have been contacted by constituents who have expressed concern that apparently racist comments in the Big Brother House have passed without any response from the Big Brother programme. We would not tolerate this kind of racism on other types of television programme and we should not do so on a programme that is watched by millions of people.

 The number of complaints received by the media watchdog, Ofcom, escalated overnight from 200 yesterday to 7,600, the highest number Big Brother has attracted in its history.

 Ofcom is the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications industries, with responsibilities across television, radio, telecommunications and wireless communications services. It will publish its findings in due course, it told The Telegraph yesterday, but post transmission. 

 Channel 4, the television network which broadcasts Celebrity Big Brother, has received another 2,000 emails and calls. 

 Most centre round the alleged racism or bullying inflicted on the 31-year-old Bollywood actress by three housemates Jade Goody, 25, who has become a celebrity after appearing in a Big Brother episode in 2002; Jo Meara, 27, who used to be in a pop group called Steps and now breeds dogs; and Danielle Lloyd, 23, a glamour model who has talked endlessly about her footballer boyfriend, Teddy Sheringham, 17 years her senior.

 Jades boyfriend, Jack Tweedy, has also attacked Shilpa, as did Jades mother, Jackiey before the latters eviction. 

 Although CBB trades on personality conflicts to make the programme interesting, Channel 4 is now under pressure to decide whether the borderline into racism and bullying is now being crossed. 

 Shilpa, who, one assumes, has had a privileged, pampered, cosseted life in India, has now been called the Indian, whatshername, c..t, a complete w..ker f..g Paki, and a dog. 

 Danielle, pretty, blonde but with a strong Liverpool accent which sometimes is a little difficult to decipher, was unhappy with Shilpas cooking, complained the chicken she had prepared was pink and underprepared (it probably was), and said she used onions rather a lot. 

 She said that Shilpa had touched other peoples food you dont know where those hands have been. 

 Jo suggested that Indians were thin because they were ill as a result of undercooking their food. 

 Channel 4 said in a statement: The social interactions and dynamics of the group are one of the key parts of the Big Brother story and viewers have a right to see these portrayed accurately however this is balanced with our duty not to broadcast material that may cause unjustifiable offence. We take this matter very seriously and Big Brother does not tolerate bullying or racist abuse in any form. Big Brother is closely monitoring all the housemates and will take appropriate measures to reprimand such behaviour where necessary. 

 Todays Daily Star, a tabloid newspaper, led its front page with the following headline: Celeb BB In Race Row. 

 It made a perceptive point: six times as many complaints had been made about the treatment Shilpa had received than had been made about the coverage of Saddam Husseins hanging.

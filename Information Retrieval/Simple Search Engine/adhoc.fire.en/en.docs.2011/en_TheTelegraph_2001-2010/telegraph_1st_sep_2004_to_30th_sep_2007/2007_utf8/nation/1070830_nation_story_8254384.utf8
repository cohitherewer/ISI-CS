 126 have nothing to do with 123: Antony

 SUJAN DUTTA 

 New Delhi, Aug. 29: The defence establishment wants to insulate its $10-billion order for fighter aircraft from political and diplomatic pressures. 

 Defence minister A.K. Antonys instructions to his officers to keep the process of buying the aircraft above board after the competition was thrown open yesterday translate into a simple inequation: 123 is not 126. 

 The nuclear deal has got nothing to do with defence procurement, Antony said. We are not going to be influenced by anything or anybody but by the requirements of the air force. The choice will be made on merit only. I have instructed that it (the procurement process) should be transparent at every stage, he said hours after the requests for proposals were handed over to representatives of the bidders. 

 The 123-126 parallel is drawn mostly by critics from the Left who see the India-US civilian nuclear deal under the 123 Agreement as a means to blood India into a strategic alliance with the US. 

 The invitation of bids for 126 multi-role combat aircraft from two US companies, apart from four others, is also the first time in decades that American companies are participating in a race to bag a big military order from India.

 The six bidders for the order who have to send in their proposals by March 3, 2008 have welcomed the ministrys requests for proposals. 

 An Indian Air Force team was at the MAKs Moscow air show that concluded last week where the MiG 35 was displayed and its capabilities showed off. (The army chief, General J.J. Singh, who is also the chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, will be leading a tri-service delegation to Russia next month.) 

 In a statement, the Boeing Company said it welcomes the invitation to participate in Indias multi-role combat aircraft competition.We look forward to studying the request for proposal document in detail and in concert with our F/A-18 Super Hornet industry partners. 

 The Swedish company Saab, which is competing for the order with its JAS 39C Gripen, also said: We look forward to the competition process and are confident that Gripen will meet, or exceed, every operational requirement raised by the Indian Air Force, said Tony Ogilvy, Gripen Internationals director, India. 

 Selecting the Gripen to equip its air force will provide India with the worlds most cost-effective, new-generation, multi-role combat aircraft in full operational service.

 Lockheed Martin, the makers of the F-16 Fighting Falcon, said its response would be tailored for the IAF. We have been anticipating possible sets of requirements for the past several months, it said. We will now analyse the actual requirements in detail.

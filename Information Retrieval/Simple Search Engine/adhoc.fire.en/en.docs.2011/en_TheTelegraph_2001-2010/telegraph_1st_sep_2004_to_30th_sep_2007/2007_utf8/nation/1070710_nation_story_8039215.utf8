 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Leap for lean and mean cop 

 To those weary of seeing pot- bellied policemen doing the rounds, head constable Anil Salian is a refreshing sight.

 The 48-year-old, an athlete who has stuck to a tough fitness regimen for several years, is an ideal of sorts for his rotund colleagues. 

 At a competition organised by the Veterans Athletic Federation of India in Bangalore last month, Salian bagged silver medals in the high jump and 800 metres, besides a bronze in the 400-metre race. Salian now has the opportunity to represent India at the 21st Malaysian Open Masters Athletics Championships this month. But he hasnt found a sponsor. My trip will cost around Rs 40,000. But for me collecting the sum has been a struggle, he says.

 Salian, posted at Mumbais Pant Nagar police station, wakes up at 5am and jogs for an hour. At his age, many may find the regimen demanding, but Salian has no problems. It is not easy to keep up with the physical fitness regimen, but as a policeman, its not impossible either. 

 Enrol to go places

 It could be the ideal course for travel junkies. Delhis Jamia Milia Islamia university is offering courses in travel and tourism management, the first by a university in Delhi. 

 Students will learn cutting edge best practices followed in the travel industry internationally, apart from field trips. Practical knowledge of some foreign languages Spanish, Portuguese and French will also be imparted. 

 The undergraduate course, called a certificate course, requires the applicant to score more than 45 per cent in the Class XII board exams. The fee is Rs 13,000. 

 The diploma course, for postgraduate students, requires a graduation degree in any subject. The fee for this programme is Rs 16,000. The last date for applications is July 31.

 On shaky ground

 Many in Hyderabads apartments may be living in a house of cards. 

 It has been revealed that hundreds of flats in Cyberabad have not been issued occupancy certificates from civic bodies. The problem has shed light on the increase in illegally constructed buildings on encroached land. 

 Apartments are being occupied, sold and bought illegally without certificates, said a municipal corporation official. 

 A recent review has shown that none of the newly built complexes have been issued the certificates since last year. That means many of those who have moved into new houses over the past few months should not be there.

 Courts have ordered a crackdown on the illegal structures but civic authorities complain that political interference has prevented the demolition of some 1,200 buildings. 

 Blueline check

 Blueline bus drivers, blamed for several fatal accidents in the capital, will have to undergo fresh training and pass a fresh test, the Delhi government has announced. 

 The month-long training will start in 15 days and will be conducted by the Delhi Transport Corporation, transport minister Haroon Yusuf said. 

 Blueline drivers will have to relearn, he said on Monday. Following the training, Yusuf said, all drivers will have to appear for a test. 

 Only after the fresh test will they be given permits, he said. 

 The decision comes after three persons, including an 11-year-old boy, died in the past five days in accidents involving these buses.

 Delhi: Its sixty years since India gained independence, and for those in a reflective mood Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of the Mahatma, provides an insight into the life of the Father of the Nation. At the India International Centre auditorium on June 11 at 6.30pm.

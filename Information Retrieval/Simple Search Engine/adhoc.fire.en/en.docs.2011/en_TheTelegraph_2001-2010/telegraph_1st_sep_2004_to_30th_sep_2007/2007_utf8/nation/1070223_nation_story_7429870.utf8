 Tax raids on Mumbais elite

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 22: The Page 3 crowd withdrew into a shell today after the third largest income-tax raid in three years targeted doctors, spa-owners, interior designers and advertising professionals in Mumbai and Thane.

 Seven hundred IT professionals panned across Mumbai and Thane to raid over 200 premises and 40 businesses in these two cities, said S.S.N. Moorthy, the director-general (investigation), income-tax department.

 The raids, which began early in the morning, continued into the night.

 A well-known doctor couple involved closely with beauty pageants found the taxman at their door. One-stop shops for slimming, beauty and cosmetic treatments and high-profile spas were among the businesses searched, a tax official said.

 As news of some among them being searched filtered out, party regulars refused to take calls or comment on the raids that have come days before the budget.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram said he did not know about the raids because he was in a meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs.

 But the Central Board of Direct Taxes stepped in with a denial after rumours that stock-brokers had been raided brought the sensex down. No searches are being conducted on stock-brokers and other stock market intermediaries, spokesperson A.K. Sinha said in New Delhi.

 Moorthy seconded him. Doctors, service providers, diagnostic centres, caterers, interior decorators and spas were being raided, he said, not stock-brokers. 

 In Pune and Thane, real-estate players were searched. IT firms in Kochi and a flour mill in Delhi were also raided, Sinha said.

 The raids were based on our internal investigations and vigilance reports. We were aware of the irregularities and were waiting for the right time. It was a highly organised operation, said a senior official in the income-tax department (Mumbai circle).

 Sources said the real estate boom brought builders and others connected with real estate and infrastructure under the scanner.

 Property rates in Mumbais prime localities match those of Manhattan. A comparison between the asking rate for property prices in Mumbai and Thane and the taxes paid by builders clearly revealed tax evasion, said a senior IT department official.

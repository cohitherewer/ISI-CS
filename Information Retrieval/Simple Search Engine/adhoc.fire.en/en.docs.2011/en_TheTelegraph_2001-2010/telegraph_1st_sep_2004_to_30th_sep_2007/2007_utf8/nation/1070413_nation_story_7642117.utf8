 BJP savours CD relief

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, April 12: BJP strategists were triumphant today after managing to get the hearings on the controversial CD issue deferred by using election commissioner Navin Chawlas bias against them as the reason.

 Nominations for the seventh and final round of polling in Uttar Pradesh are to be filed by April 20. A day before that, the poll panel will announce its decision on whether Chawla can play referee in the CD row. 

 The BJP believes that the possibility of a strict action such as de-recognition and freeze on election symbol after the final round of nominations is very remote.

 When the panel meets on April 19, the party will push for the matter to be taken up after the filing of nominations. 

 However, if Chawla gets a clearance to sit in judgment on the CD issue, the BJP will move the Supreme Court. The order will be immediately stayed because of Chawlas obvious bias against us, said a senior leader.

 Party strategists say they arent concerned about the threat of the interim order, which the Congress believes will be passed against the BJP. They would tell us to behave properly, ask the police to ensure that the CD is not circulated and everyone would be happy, the leader said. 

 He seemed to suggest that mild warnings like these wont cripple the partys election machinery.

 General secretary Arun Jaitley, spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who will present the BJPs case during the hearings, know there isnt much to gain by focusing on the anti-Muslim CD allegedly distributed by senior Uttar Pradesh leader Lalji Tandon.

 They believe they have a strong case in questioning the impartiality of Chawla, whose removal the BJP has already sought through a petition filed in the Supreme Court.

 Away from the back-to-back strategy sessions in party offices, rivals were in no mood to let the CD dust settle. The Congresss Kapil Sibal said he had assurances from the commission that it would order the seizure of the controversial anti-Muslim CD and prevent its distribution.

 On the demand that Chawla should be kept out of the hearings, Sibal said the BJP should approach the high court with the charges that it has against the election commissioner.

 Druggie Kate set to gather Indian Moss

 Kate Moss

 London, Aug. 27: Druggie supermodel Kate Moss may soon be unleashed on India because a retail tycoon who thinks the world of her is poised to bring his department stores to India. 

 Sir Philip Green, the retail entrepreneur, has apparently signed an agreement with an Indian partner and is said to be planning to launch his Bhs (previously British Home Store) brand in India, initially in Mumbai and Delhi. 

 Moss is linked with Topshop, another retail chain owned by Green for whom the supermodel has designed a line of clothes. 

 The waif-like supermodel with a chequered past is best known in Britain for her on-off relationship with druggie pop singer Pete Doherty, but her very notoriety has been exploited by Green to push his brand image. She has managed to boost her 30m-a-year earnings in the process. 

 Moss, 34, a single mother with a daughter from a previous relationship she was once caught snorting cocaine on candid camera is the best known face for Topshop, which Green also wants to bring to India along with Bhs, that occupies the middle market. Topshop, in contrast, established in 1964, has more of young image. 

 I have always been a big fan of Topshop and regularly shop there, Moss has said. I love what they stand for and am very excited at the thought of working with them. Its going to be great fun. 

 Although Greens initial foray will be with Bhs, it seems inconceivable he will not use Moss to promote his clothes in India. TopShop has over 300 stores in the UK. 

 Green has spoken of his admiration for Moss: Kate has a unique position as a true fashion icon and I look forward to helping develop Kate Moss for Topshop into a global brand. 

 Bhs has signed a deal with Al Maya Group, which has run Bhss Dubai franchise for more than 20 years, the Sunday Telegraph reported yesterday. L.K. Pagarani, a Dubai-based Indian businessman, runs the Al Maya Group. 

 Green is on record that he wants to expand TopShop into India and elsewhere. Our plan is to develop Topshop into a global brand. 

 Both Tesco and Kingfisher have been looking to set up operations in the country, while US supermarket group Wal-Mart announced a franchise deal earlier this month with Bharti, the Sunday Telegraph said. Foreign multi-brand retailers are prohibited from operating stores but can set up franchise operations in the country. 

 It also said: India is experiencing a retail boom amid strong economic growth. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects retail sales in India to nearly double over the next five years. 

 It also pointed out: Bhs will join a host of UK retailers either setting up in the country or looking to develop their operations there. Mothercare has made significant strides since entering the market last year. It recently said it hoped to open 100 stores in India within five years. M amp;S is also looking to develop a large franchise operation.

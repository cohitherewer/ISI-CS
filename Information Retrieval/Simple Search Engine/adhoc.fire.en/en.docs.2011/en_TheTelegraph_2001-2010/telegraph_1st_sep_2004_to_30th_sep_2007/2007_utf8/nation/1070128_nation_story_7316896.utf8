 Clean-up funds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 27: Calcutta and other cities seen to be lagging behind in their handling of waste disposal and management have received a gentle nudge from the Centre. But its one theyre unlikely to mind.

 The urban development ministry has cleared five projects worth Rs 528.19 crore for Calcutta, Thane, Vadodara, Guwahati and Faridabad. 

 A project costing Rs 56.69 crore has been approved to ensure better management of waste in all municipalities under the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Area. The funding is to be shared equally by the Centre and the state government. 

 While the local authorities can distribute the funds for various smaller projects, the aim of the funding for Calcutta is to bring the city on a par with the other three metros (Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai) on waste handling, a senior ministry official said. 

 The ministry is yet to decide on over a hundred projects proposed by several states the ones cleared are considered the most urgent. 

 Sanitation of cities is known to be a priority with urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy. 

 Developing new methods to dispose solid waste so that it does not mix with ground water is to be the focus of the project in Calcutta, ministry officials said. 

 The ministry will release the funding in instalments. Its central monitoring and sanctioning committee that finally decides on the clearance of projects has recommended that Rs 2 crore of the amount allocated to Calcutta be released initially. 

 Ministry sources said the next instalment is likely to be released only in the next fiscal. 

 The Centre has also allocated Rs 20 crore as additional assistance for Bengal. 

 The funding for the waste disposal project is under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission the UPA governments flagship programme aiming to make Indias cities comparable to cities in the developed world.

 Along with this, schemes worth over Rs 1,900 crore have been cleared for Bengal under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission this year. 

 In all, projects worth nearly Rs 10,000 crore have been sanctioned under the mission since the UPA came to power.

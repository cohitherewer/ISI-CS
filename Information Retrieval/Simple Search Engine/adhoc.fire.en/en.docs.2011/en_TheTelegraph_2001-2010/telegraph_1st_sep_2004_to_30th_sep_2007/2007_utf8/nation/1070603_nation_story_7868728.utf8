 Lull in mayhem, fear on highway

 On the Delhi-Jaipur highway, June 2: A charred, blackened truck, and miles of deserted roads.

 After five days of violence, silence had descended on the 160-km stretch from Shahjahanpur, the first town in Rajasthan, to the Pink City. Shops were open, but there were no customers. The few that had ventured out had fear on their faces.

 What can I say? Its all politics, rued Ram Lakhan Singh in Kotputli, where one person died in the Gujjar violence over reservation.

 Nobody ever thinks of providing food for those who cannot afford even a days meal.

 The highway, where traffic has always been heavy, resembled a forward border area where only those who are needed are permitted.

 In Behror, the burnt truck stood as a stark reminder of the horror that the highway witnessed till yesterday.

 Vehicles did ply on the highway today, but only a few. The eyes stretched for miles for a glimpse of another.

 At Behror, the armys presence inside Midway, the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporations resort, was an indication of the governments mood. We are here and we will be here till peace is restored, said a jawan, his finger on the trigger of his rifle.

 While the armys presence along the highway has brought a semblance of normality, it has scared the quota warriors.

 They (the soldiers) are not trained to save people. They have made it clear that they will take immediate action at any sign of trouble. We know what that means. We are staying at home now. It is the job of our leaders to thrash out an understanding with the government for Scheduled Tribe status, said Ram Lakha Singh at Manoharpur as the jawans, who stood nearby, warned him to stay away from the road.

 If the protesters were frightened, police were wary, too.

 Twice they stopped the vehicle of this correspondent, once at Pawta and then in Jaipur, to ask about conditions on the highway.

 Aapko to koi problem to nahi hui. (Hope you didnt meet with any problems.) Is everything OK? they asked.

 For the record, only two buses full of stranded tourists were flagged off to Delhi from Jaipur today, escorted by the army till the border with Rajasthan.

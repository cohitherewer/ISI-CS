 Panchayat annuls wedding, seizes baby

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Sept. 1: A Haryana caste panchayat has snatched a week-old baby from its parents after annulling their marriage because they are from the same gotra or clan.

 The Katalhedi village council in Karnal district, which ordered Pawan and Kavita to separate or live like brother and sister, said it had handed the infant boy to another couple but refused to disclose their name.

 Sarpanch Rajesh Kumar had earlier said he would personally take care of the baby.

 The decision by the khap panchayat a traditional elders council distinct from an elected panchayat has found support from the state archaeology, museum and archives minister. They (the parents) should have kept the traditions in mind. Its their fault, minister Meena Mandal said.

 Hindu customs forbid marriages within a gotra. Pawan and Kavita, both from the Valmiki gotra, had fled to Mumbai last year following threats after their marriage. They were summoned by the panchayat after they returned recently.

 The husband and wife can go back to their parents or live like brother and sister. The panchayat will look after the baby, sarpanch Kumar said.

 Kavita was forced to tie a rakhi on her husbands wrist, and Pawans family was fined Rs 65,000. I dont know what to do, Pawan said.

 District superintendent of police A.S. Chawla denied any knowledge of the incident. No one has filed any complaint but I will look into the matter, he said.

 Karnal deputy commissioner B.S. Malik was unavailable for comment, so was chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. The district administration has been asked to investigate, an official here said.

 Caste panchayats wield enormous power across northern India, settling marital and property disputes and punishing crime. They have been known to hand over a mans wife to satisfy some shibboleth, and to order beatings and even executions.

 No aspect of life escapes their scrutiny or edicts. After Indias World Cup debacle, a khap panchayat in Haryanas Jind banned youth from playing cricket in 28 villages.

 Hooda has defended the institution many times, saying village communities need these panchayats in times of crisis.

 In June this year, a khap panchayat forced a same-gotra couple, Manoj and Babli, to drink pesticide even after Punjab and Haryana High Court had ordered police protection for them.

 The same month, another such couple, Anita and Sonu, were lured back to their village in Rohtak and stabbed to death in public.

 In February, 19-year-old Gudia and her physically challenged husband were chopped to pieces under an Agra panchayats orders for the same offence.

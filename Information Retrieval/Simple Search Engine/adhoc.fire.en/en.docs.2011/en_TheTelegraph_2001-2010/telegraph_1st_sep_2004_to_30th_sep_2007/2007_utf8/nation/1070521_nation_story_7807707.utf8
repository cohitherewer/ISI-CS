The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Eye on terror borders, through Calcutta

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 Nancy Powell

 New Delhi, May 20: Western powers are keenly eyeing Indias tough eastern neighbourhood these days, with Calcutta a choice stopover to debate terrorism and religious extremism both emanating from within as well as from neighbouring countries like Nepal and Bangladesh.

 Soon after being named US ambassador to Nepal, Nancy Powell was in Calcutta a few months ago to discuss the impact of ISI-inspired cross- border insurgency with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 Junior British foreign minister Kim Howells, too, visited Calcutta, and Guwahati where he met chief minister Tarun Gogoi to talk about Ulfa.

 Powell, one of Americas key intelligence officers, is well known in South Asia, having served as political counsellor at the American embassy in Delhi, the deputy chief of mission in Bangladesh and US ambassador to Pakistan one year after 9/11.

 She returned home a couple of years ago to join the National Intelligence Council as its South Asia specialist.

 It was in this capacity that Powell travelled to Calcutta to meet Bhattacharjee. Sources said she was interested in hearing how the CPM and the Bengal government viewed and dealt with terrorism and fundamentalism.

 It is no secret that the Americans are hugely concerned with Islamic fundamentalism these days and believe that Indias east is the new frontier that must be watched. Powell wanted to know how the Left government looked at these issues of security, a source said.

 Security analyst Ashok Mehta feels that Powells appointment as Nepal envoy is an indication of Americas heightened interest in looking at Maoist insurgency through the prism of its global war on terrorism.

 The Americans are hugely apprehensive that the Maoists played such a central role in the peoples movement against the monarchy last year, Mehta said, adding that they view the insurgency in Nepal and the extremism in Bangladesh as key manifestations of their war against terrorism.

 Nepal is also a good place to watch Tibet as well as Chinas growing influence in that country, Mehta said. Chinese ambassador Zheng Xianglin was the first foreign envoy to present his credentials to Prime Minister G.P. Koirala rather than the king.

 As for the British junior minister, he was in Guwahati a few days ago to inaugurate a modern information centre, but used the occasion to tell journalists that the UK was concerned about insurgency and terrorism in Indias Northeast.

 You live in a tough neighbourhood surrounded by countries which are facing difficult times, Howells said. 

 Referring to Bangladesh and Nepal, he pointed out that the situation would become worse if they became failed states.

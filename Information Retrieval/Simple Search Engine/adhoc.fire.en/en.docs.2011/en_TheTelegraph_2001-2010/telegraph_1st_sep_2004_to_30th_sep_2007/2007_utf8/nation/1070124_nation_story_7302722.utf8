 Warrant against Lashkar conduit

 New Delhi (PTI): A Delhi court has issued 

 warrants to produce Tariq Ahmed Dar, who was deported from 

 Bangladesh three months back, before it on Wednesday.

 Delhi police were supposed to bring Dar, who is said to have won a Mr Dhaka contest three years ago, to the court on Tuesday, but couldnt do so as they were too busy with preparations for Republic Day programmes. Jail authorities will now bring him to court.

 Dars counsel, Naushad Ahmed Khan, argued before the court that the police had failed to prove his clients guilt so far despite having kept him in illegal custody over the past three months.

 Dar was arrested at New Delhi airport on the suspicion of being a Lashkar-e-Toiba conduit.Two arrested Laskhar militants had named Dar.

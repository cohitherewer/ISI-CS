 Mamata salvo

 Calcutta, Aug. 23: Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee today said the UPA government should accept the CPMs challenge and prepare for mid-term polls. 

 The Union government is surviving on CPM support. If the Left withdraws support, the Centre would turn into a lame-duck government. So, it would be better for the Congress to face elections, she added.

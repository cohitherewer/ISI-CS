 NRI cop faces jail for lying

 London, Sept. 1 (PTI): An Indian-origin policewoman faces a jail sentence after she was found guilty of claiming insurance by lying that she had been robbed of her cellphones.

 Davinder Gill, 30, was convicted by a jury of obtaining property by deception.

 She allegedly made four such false claims over a three-year period. She had earlier pleaded guilty to charges of obtaining property by deception in 2005 and 2006, and another count of attempting to obtain property by deception in 2004.

 Gill told the court that on two occasions her phone had been stolen but she was too lazy to report them.

 City court judge David Elvin, while granting her bail yesterday, warned Gill he was considering all options and adjourned the sentencing for October 9.

 As a police officer if these offences had been committed in the line of duty it would most probably be a custodial sentence, he said.

 Badal appeal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, May 21: Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal today said Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh should apologise to defuse tension in the region.

 In no mood to play intermediary in solving the controversy caused by Gurmeets portrayal as Guru Gobind Singh in an advertisement, the chief minister said the Dera chiefs action had hurt the sentiments of Punjabis.

 Badal has been trying to make radical Sikhs understand the gravity of the situation and has been pleading with them not to incite passions. The Akal Takht, the highest Sikh temporal body, yesterday succumbed to pressure from radicals in the Sant Samaj, an umbrella organisation of Sikh religious heads.

 Apart from calling a bandh in Punjab tomorrow, the radicals got Akal Takht priest Joginder Sigh Vedanti to announce their demand for closure of Dera branches in the state by May 27.

 I appeal to everybody to maintain peace. If an apology from Gurmeet can solve the problem, then he should come forward to offer his hand of peace. What are babas meant for? For peace, of course. It is not a question of bending down. A good preacher is never big or small, but humble, Badal said.

 On whether he would consider the request of the Dera officials to broker peace, Badal said the governments duty was to maintain law and order.

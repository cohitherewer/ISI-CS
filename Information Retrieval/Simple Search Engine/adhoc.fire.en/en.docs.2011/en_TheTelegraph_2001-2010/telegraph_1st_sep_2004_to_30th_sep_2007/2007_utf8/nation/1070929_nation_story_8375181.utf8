 Rahul requests, Singh serves up

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

New Delhi, Sept. 28: Rahul Gandhi proposed, Manmohan Singh delivered in two days.

 With the rural job scheme extended across India at Rahuls request, his cheerleaders in the party have been touting it as yet another manifestation of the Amethi MPs commitment and determination to boost the partys aam aadmi agenda.

 Official sources, however, tried to play down the new Congress general secretarys role in pushing the decision. Rahul had on Wednesday requested the Prime Minister to implement the job scheme in every one of the countrys 595 rural districts.

 The sources said Rahul did not wish to project the move as an individual success and would caution his colleagues against airing such a view. They dismissed the theory that the young MPs interventions signalled a larger role for him in government decisions that might alter the party-government equation.

 The Congresss objective is to play up the aam aadmi theme, build its campaign around the rural job scheme and other social initiatives and, crucially, claim the credit for them rather than let the Opposition usurp it.

 Rahul and other young MPs Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sachin Pilot and Sandeep Dikshit stressed the last point, as did Jairam Ramesh, Prithviraj Chavan and Salman Khursheed, at the first meeting of the future challenges group yesterday.

 When Rahul and the other general secretaries met the Prime Minister on Wednesday, they had mentioned how BJP state governments were passing off the Centres social initiatives as their own.

 Many in the Congress feel that in the past three years, the party apparatus has done nothing to counter this.

 The first big challenge Rahul and his colleagues have identified is to market and sell initiatives like the rural job scheme, Bharat Nirmaan and the National Rural Health Mission as the governments gifts to the common man. 

 Only then, at election time, will the slogans hawking the Congresss commitment to Bharat ka naya nirmaan (building a new India) sound credible.

 The focus on the flagship social schemes may also take the edge off the Left attack on the Centres pro-US policy and its alleged failure to contain the anti-poor price rise. It will help cool the heat generated by the debate on the nuclear deal and the Ram setu, a Congress official said.

 One of Rahuls first objectives is to shake the Congress organisations up from their partial stupor in states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

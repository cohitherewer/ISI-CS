 Life amp; Dhoni in math

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 Easy numbers 

 New Delhi, June 7: School mathematics will no longer just be about numbers. 

 Often dubbed boring and mechanical, the new math textbooks prepared by the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) have a flavour of social concerns added subtly between the numbers. 

 From gender sensitivity to the concept of sharing, students as young as those in Class III will be exposed to a blend of real life and fictitious stories through which math will be taught. The change will be introduced in this session.

 Class III students will also learn to prepare a timeline through the real life story of Dhanbads Pedki Devi. 

 The wife of a farmer, Pedki talks about her childhood, the time she broke her foot while climbing a tree and about her marriage. 

 At 35, my world came to a stop. My husband fell ill and died. His brothers tried to take away our farm. They beat me badly and said I was a witch, she tells students in her page-long testimony. 

 Pedki recalls that she first saw a police station when she was 40, that she learnt to read and write only at the age of 45, and two years later, she got her daughter married. 

 In one of the exercises, students are asked: Can we share? This is followed by the story of a mummy bird who wants to distribute 12 grains equally among her babies. This way, she, and the students, are taught division.

 We dont want to segregate different subjects and create boundaries between them. We want students to think about the society they are living in while studying every subject, an NCERT official said. 

 Other stories seek to break stereotypes. The Class IV book has a real life story and pictures of Kiran, who was married off at 13 and whose father stopped her from studying. 

 Today, the Patna woman is a successful scrap dealer. I hated math. Today, math is useful for my work, she says in the book. 

 To save the textbooks from an excess of serious issues, the NCERT has injected a dose of cricket, too. Commentators are shown discussing a cricket match, where a batsman named Dhoni, on 96, hits a six to reach his century. Next, students are asked to write his score after the hit.

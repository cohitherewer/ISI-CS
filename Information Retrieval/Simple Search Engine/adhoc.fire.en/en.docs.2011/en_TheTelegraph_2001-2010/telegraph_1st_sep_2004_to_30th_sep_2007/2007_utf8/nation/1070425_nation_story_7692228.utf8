 Chandigarh, April 24: A travel agent, Harbhajan Singh, was arrested from Maqsoodan near Jalandhar and 34 passports seized from his residence in a raid today.

 Harbhajans wife Joginder was also arrested. Some of the passports seized carried fake US visas.

 Two travel agents from Punjab who had links with BJP MP Babubhai Katara and are suspected to be part of an international human trafficking racket are still absconding.

 We are interrogating Harbhajan and Joginder to see if they have any links with Katara. Harbhajan is believed to be one of the major travel agents operating illegally in the region, Kapurthala SSP Rakesh Agarwal said.

 According to the police, the arrests followed a complaint lodged by one Pritam Singh that Harbhajan had failed to send his son abroad after taking Rs 8.15 lakh from him.

 The police are verifying whether the passports seized from Harbhajans residence are authentic. The visa stamps seized are of very good quality and it is not easy to tell they are fake once they are stamped on the passports. We have information that some more passports both fake and real and visa stamps of countries such as the US, Germany, France, Italy and Canada are in the house. We are looking for them, a police officer said.

 The police are also probing Harbhajans links with two other travel agents, Joginder Singh and Santu Masih. Joginder and Santu had put a tie-up of the Kapurthala-based woman, Paramjeet Kaur, and a Hoshiarpur boy, Amarjit Singh, in touch with Katara so that they could illegally migrate to Canada using passports of the MPs family members.

 Following Kataras arrest, the police have identified more than 350 travel agents against whom complaints of cheating and fraud are pending and launched a crackdown on them.

 The travel agents are mostly from the Jalandhar, Nawanshahar, Ludhiana, Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur districts, where people aspiring to go abroad are willing to pay handsomely.

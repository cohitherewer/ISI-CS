 Help at hand turns heist master

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Mumbai, June 27: Suresh Jain thought he was leaving his jewellery shop in safe hands when he left the keys with his domestic help of two years.

 He returned to find his trusted lieutenant gone and jewellery worth Rs 60 lakh missing possibly the biggest heist by a domestic help here. 

 Jain is cursing himself but there are many who think he should thank his stars. Had he been around when his shop was burgled, they say, he might not have even lived to tell how he was betrayed.

 Like Jagdish Tukaram Kadam, 60, and his 55-year-old wife Pratibha. The elderly couple were murdered by their domestic help for Rs 10 lakh that Jagdish had got after his voluntary retirement.

 While petty thefts by domestic helps are not uncommon, incidents like the murder of the Kadams have shown that the more desperate are even ready to kill. It suits them fine if their victims their employers happen to be old.

 Take the case of Mehroo Dosu Sandha. The 75-year-old was strangled in her Malabar Hill house in south Mumbai by her 18-year-old domestic help from Bihar, Umesh Mondal, who then ran away with a suitcase full of silver crockery.

 Advocate Waris Pathan says the city is vulnerable to crimes committed by hired helps as most youths work long hours and senior citizens are left alone at home. Elders and children are at the mercy of watchmen and domestic helps.

 Police say they have always stressed the importance of registering domestic helps with the force. People should do this as it makes the servants aware that their details and photos are with the police, says an officer with Oshiwara police station near Andheri.

 But south Mumbai resident Koel Shah says: Forget my servant, I am myself not comfortable with the idea. I dont want to have anything to do with the police. Knowing the way the government functions, I am sure one visit to the police station will not suffice.

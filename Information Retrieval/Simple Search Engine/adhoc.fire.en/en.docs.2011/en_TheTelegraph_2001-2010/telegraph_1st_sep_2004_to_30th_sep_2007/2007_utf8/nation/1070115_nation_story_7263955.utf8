The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 For scientists, its time to plug the gap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Ananthamurthy

 New Delhi, Jan. 14: Kannada writer Udipi Rajagopalacharya Ananthamurthy had an unusual audience as he spoke about 1,000 years of Kannada literature biologists, physicists and computer scientists. 

 Ananthamurthy is now visiting professor at the Centre for Contemporary Studies (CCS), a two-year-old department of the Indian Institute of Science (IIS) in Bangalore, where scientists can experience what some of them used to think were forbidden zones. 

 At the centre, scientists have listened to a talk by financier George Soros, picked up lessons in Indian history, and received filmmakers as well as economists. Next week, a talk is scheduled on fiction and politics in England during the 1930s and its relevance to India now. 

 Integrating the pure sciences with social sciences has been my lifes dream, said Raghavendra Gadagkar, chairman of the centre whos also a biologist at the IIS studying the social behaviour of insects for many years. 

 Now, the knowledge commission wants a bigger effort to bridge the gap between the natural sciences and social sciences. It has urged the government to set up a National Science and Social Science Foundation (NS3F) with an annual budget of Rs 1,250 crore. 

 There is very rigid compartmentalisation... and little or no interaction between researchers in natural sciences and social sciences, Sam Pitroda, chairman of the commission, said in the recommendations sent to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 

 The commission has said the Rs 1,250-crore funding would allow NS3F to support carefully selected projects that address unsolved problems connecting natural sciences with the social sciences. 

 India will be the first country to have such an organisation, Pushpa Mitra Bhargava, vice-chairman of the panel told The Telegraph. Knowledge is seamless. Society is science-based and advances in science and technology have societal implications. 

 The commission has said the foundation will be expected to promote studies investigating relationships of science with other areas such as economics, sociology, politics, art and literature. It will also support studies on the social, political, legal, moral and ethical implications of science. It has said the NS3F should work towards having at least three to four Indian scientists or social scientists produce work in six years which should be worthy of a Nobel prize. 

 But some scientists say it is not clear whether a foundation and funding would be the best way to integrate the two branches of knowledge. Making the education system more flexible may be another way to do this, Gadagkar told The Telegraph. 

 Indias education system, which forces students to pick between science, arts, or commerce courses at the end of 12 years of school, has long been viewed by the scientific community as a key obstacle to flexibility and integration. 

 Were handicapped. When we get higher degrees, doors should open up. Instead, here they just close down, Gadagkar said.

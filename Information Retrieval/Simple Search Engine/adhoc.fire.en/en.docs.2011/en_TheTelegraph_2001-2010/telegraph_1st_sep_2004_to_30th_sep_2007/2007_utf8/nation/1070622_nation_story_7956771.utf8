 PIL turbulence, timed to takeoff

 Goyal: Bumpy ride

 Mumbai, June 21: An old controversy over alleged links with gangster Dawood Ibrahim returned to haunt Jet Airways boss Naresh Goyal today, a week before the airlines rights issue and a month before its plan to start US flights.

 Hearing a public interest litigation filed by one Mohammed Furquan, a division bench of Chief Justice Swantanter Kumar and Justice S.C. Dharmadhikhari issued notices to Jet Airways.

 It also asked a responsible Mumbai police officer to be present before the court at the next hearing, and adjourned the case till July 19. 

 Soon after the adjournment, reports began circulating that the court had ordered an inquiry.

 However, Jet Airways said in a statement: The report that an investigation has been ordered by the high court is totally baseless, incorrect and mischievous. We have so far not received any intimation from any quarter of any proceeding or order that may have been passed.

 Our enquiries reveal that one Dr Furquam, who had filed two similar PILs earlier, has once again moved Bombay High Court.

 The airline said the judges have adjourned the matter to enable some of the respondents to get instructions from the respective departments and have director notice to be served on us.

 Alleging a nexus between Goyal and the gangster, the petitioner, who claimed to be the editor of a New Delhi-based Urdu fortnightly, Sach Bilkul Sach, demanded a CBI probe.

 The petition does not contain any exhibits to support the allegations, but refers to news reports which said the intelligence bureau had filed a report on the alleged nexus.

 The petition has not been admitted by the court yet, and the matter is at an inquiry stage, public prosecutor Usha Kejriwal told The Telegraph. A petition is admitted only if the court feels the charge holds some merit.

 Last year, Goyal won security clearances from US authorities after a nearly two-year investigation into a similar charge that was filed in the US to stymie Jets entry into that market.

 Rival airlines are also looking to break into the lucrative air travel segment even though they are hemmed in by a clause that prevents new airlines to fly abroad until they have five years experience.

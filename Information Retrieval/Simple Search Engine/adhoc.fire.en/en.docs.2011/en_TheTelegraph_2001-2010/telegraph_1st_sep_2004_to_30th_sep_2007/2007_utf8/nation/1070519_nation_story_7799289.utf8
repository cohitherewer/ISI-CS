 SC bench split on death for godman

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 18: The Supreme Court was today divided over the death sentence to self-styled godman Swami Shraddhananda, who had killed his wife by burying her alive in their house in Bangalore in 1991.

 A division bench of Justices S.B. Sinha and M. Katju referred the matter to a larger bench. Shraddhananda is facing a death sentence for killing Shakereh Khaleeli, who married him after divorcing her diplomat husband in 1985.

 Although the two judges had no doubt over his guilt, Justice Sinha believed the crime did not fall in the rarest of rare category so as to warrant capital punishment. Justice Katju, however, was of the opinion that the trial court and the high court had rightly decided to sentence Murali Manohar Mishra, popularly known as Swami Shraddhananda, to death.

 Shakereh, the granddaughter of the former diwan of Mysore state, was sedated and buried alive by Shraddhananda who wanted to grab her property, including the palatial bungalow in which they were living.

 Shraddhananda, who hails from Madhya Pradesh, told Shakerehs daughters that their mother had gone abroad. One of the daughters, however, lodged a missing report in 1992. The case was solved in 1994 when the body was dug out on the basis of disclosures made by a servant.

 The godman was arrested on April 30, 1994, and put on trial before a Bangalore court. The court pronounced a death sentence, which was later confirmed by the high court.

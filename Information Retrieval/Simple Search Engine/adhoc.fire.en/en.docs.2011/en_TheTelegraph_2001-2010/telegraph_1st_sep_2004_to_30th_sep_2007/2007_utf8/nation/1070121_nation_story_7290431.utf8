 Shilpa in Big Brother: Making history

 London, Jan. 20: The career of Jade Goody, Shilpa Shettys principal tormentor on Celebrity Big Brother, lay in ruins today after the 25-year-old former dental assistant was chucked out for being a racist and a bully. 

 Few companies will want to touch her now. 

 Her words to the Bollywood star, whom she had called a fg loser, have come back to haunt her. 

 Meanwhile, an earnest debate was raging in Britain today about the rights and wrongs of screening the allegedly racist content of Celebrity Big Brother, following Jades eviction last night by the biggest margin in the history of this show. 

 With newspapers and politicians campaigning to have Jade booted off the show, 82 per cent of viewers voted to do just that, against 18 per cent for Shilpa. 

 Ratings, which began at 7.1 million when Shilpa went into CBB on January 3 and slipped to below 3 million, rocketed to 7.8 million viewers for last nights eviction. 

 Normally, the evicted contestant emerges to face good-natured cheers and jeers from the crowd waiting outside Big Brother House and is then interviewed by the shows presenter, Davina McCall. 

 Last night, Channel 4 dispensed with the crowds because of security concerns. 

 Ladbrokes betting spokesman Nick Weinberg said: Jade is the most hated housemate in the history of the show. 

 McCall, who shares an agent with Jade, was slated in the media for not being aggressive enough in her questioning of Jades mother, the first housemate to be evicted. 

 Stung by the criticism, McCall was tougher with Jade who was suitably contrite after being shown footage of her worst tirades against the Bollywood actress, whose beauty and steadfast refusal to descend to the level of Jade have won her many admirers in Britain and not just among Indians. 

 Todays Daily Mail led its front page with a relieved headline, Britains big vote for Shilpa, and a glamorous photograph of Shilpa. 

 The Channel 4 board will be meeting shortly to discuss issues arising from the latest controversy. 

 British tabloids could scarcely contain their joy at the ouster. A Bigot and a Fake, was how the Daily Mirror summed it up, while the Suns headline was Goody Riddance: Bully Jade booted out. The Sun leader said: Incredible as it may seem, last nights vote was the most important in Britain since the last General Election.

 Jade was shown her last onslaught against Shilpa. Her departing contribution was to nickname Shilpa Shilpa f***awhiler and Shilpa Poppadom. After watching it, Jade was apologetic, which she must be for a while if she is to repair her shattered career. 

 According to a post-eviction poll on Sky Television, 83 per cent of respondents believe her career appearing on reality shows, writing ghosted columns, promoting products and playing a council house girl made good is over. 

 In all honesty, I am disgusted with myself witnessing what I have seen, she confessed. 

 She conceded: I look like a complete and utter, nasty, small person. I am not a racist and I sincerely apologise to anyone I have offended out there.

 Widow seeks probe

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, June 26: The widow of Haren Pandya, the former Gujarat home minister whose alleged killers were yesterday sentenced to life, has sought a reinvestigation into the murder.

 Jagruti expressed dissatisfaction at the faulty investigation by the CBI, saying the agency has not been able to establish the motive and identify the mastermind.

 Her father-in-law Vitthalbhai Pandya had yesterday pointed fingers at chief minister Narendra Modi for the murder of Haren, who was a dissident in the BJP.

 Jagruti said the CBI only followed the line of investigation set by D.G. Vanzara, the encounter specialist now in jail charged with the murder of two people.

 Vanzara, who conducted the preliminary investigation, had fabricated evidence to show that Pandyas murder was an act of terrorism to avenge the 2002 riots, she said.

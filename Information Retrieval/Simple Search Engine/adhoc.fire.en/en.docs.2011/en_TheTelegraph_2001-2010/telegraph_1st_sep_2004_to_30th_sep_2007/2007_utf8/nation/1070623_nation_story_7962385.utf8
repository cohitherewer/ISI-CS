 Princess versus snoops

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Yashodhara Raje

 Bhopal, June 22: Yashodhara Raje Scindia, Gwaliors princess MP, has called up the Madhya Pradesh intelligence chief to ask why she was being kept under surveillance.

 But chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, director-general of police A.K. Puar and IG (intelligence) Surinder Singh said Yashodharas movements were not being watched. 

 Why should we do that? asked Chauhan while inaugurating a state-level meet of kotwars village-level government officials who keep records of births and deaths.

 Yashodhara, however, is unconvinced and plans to call on BJP leaders L.K. Advani, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Rajnath Singh. 

 Sources close to her said the state BJP leadership had turned against her following the partys defeat in a recent Assembly bypoll in Scindia pocketborough Shivpuri.

 Yashodhara was the Shivpuri MLA until March, when she became Lok Sabha MP from Gwalior. 

 In Shivpuri, Yashodhara had grand designs. She wanted to nominate her protg for the byelection. The idea was to keep the seat warm for her MTV jockey son Akshay Bhansali Scindia, who made several visits to the constituency. 

 Yashodharas detractors within the BJP got wind of her plans and moved swiftly. 

 Acting against her wishes, they poached a Congress leader, Girish Gautam, for the June 2 bypoll. Yashodhara was so angry that she left for the US, refusing to campaign. 

 The June 5 verdict saw the BJP conceding the seat to the Congress. 

 Yashodhara returned last week and openly accused Chauhan of betrayal, claiming the chief minister had promised her that the Shivpuri candidate would be of her choice. 

 She also targeted state ministers hailing from the region Vajpayees nephew Anup Mishra, Narottam Mishra, Rustam Singh and Madhya Pradesh BJP chief Narendra Singh Tomar of conspiring against her.

 In this situation, the presence of two state intelligence officials at her well-guarded Rani Mahal in Gwalior infuriated her. According to the verbal complaint lodged with the state intelligence chief, Yashodhara alleged that when she was discussing a water crisis with Gwalior corporators, she noticed two unauthorised persons.

 Her aide told her they were from secret police. Yashodhara quickly ordered their arrest but before her loyalists could move, the duo sped away on a motorcycle.

 Senior police officers said the presence of intelligence officers at a politicians house was nothing unusual. After all, she was discussing the water crisis which has the potential of becoming a law-and-order problem. Why does she think we were keeping a watch on her as such? an official asked.

 Family retainer Sardar Angre, however, disagreed. He said it was extraordinary that the BJP regime was keeping an eye on its own MP. Have they forgotten that she is Amma Sahebs daughter? he asked, referring to Yashodharas legendary mother Rajmata Vijayraje Scindia.

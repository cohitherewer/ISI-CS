 Ban-cricket call echoes in south

A village in Haryana, Cup-winning captain Kapil Devs home state, isnt the only place ready to banish cricket.

 Anger against the game is also rising in Chennai, where PMK activists hit the streets demand ing a five-year ban. The protesters asked for greater primacy to be given to traditional Tamil sports, instead of investing huge sums in an Englishmens game of 11 gentlemen.

 The PMK, which has a huge following among the Vanniyars, one of the OBCs, organised a mock show at the memorial hall where party workers posing as stick-wielding traditional sportsmen were seen driving away those who were dressed as Indian cricketers.

 PMK leader S. Ramadoss railed against the cricket fad gripping the nation, saying it should be replaced with passion for football, hockey and kabaddi. He urged the state to make sure schools and colleges encourage desi sports.

 he anti-cricket brigade had another good reason: With millions glued to television during a cricket match, Ramadoss reasoned that countless man-hours are lost.

 Private eye on cheating

Private detectives have been snooping around. There are also closed-circuit TVs in each room. Special squads are checking if everything is in order. No, this isnt a high-security zone revving up, but examination halls. 

 Fed up with complaints of copying in the second pre-university examination (10+2), the Karnataka State Secondary Examination Board has hired detectives to keep an eye on students. Those taking more interest in their pockets, socks, shoes and watch straps than putting pen down to the answer sheet are potential suspects. 

 The closed-circuit TVs have been installed largely to deter teachers from helping their favourite students. Mobile teams who pay surprise visits form the third layer of security. The measures are paying off only 100 students have been caught and debarred this year for copying. The figure had been 1,000 over the past decade.

 Babus face CAG fire

The babus of Andhra Pradesh are struggling to set the record straight. The records they are supposed to keep to show how the taxpayers money is being spent the right way.

 A Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report handed in last week holds civil servants responsible for causing the exchequer a loss of Rs 6,762 crore. Thats the kind of money the state is struggling to find for its dams and farm projects.

 The heads of departments havent bothered to remove discrepancies in accounting practices, in spite of being alerted with 9,695 inspection reports and 24,525 audit observations. It is the CAGs duty to check transactions and verify if important records are being maintained. 

 Mostly, these are about the money allotted to departments and the manner in which it has been spent. It is a tragedy that many IAS officers and department heads have not even sent reports, the CAG fretted.

 Path-breaking

Mumbai can look forward to another world-class high-speed corridor. Plans have been laid out for a 14-lane road from Bhaba Atomic Research Centre in Mumbai to Kalamboli in Raigad, on the outskirts of the city.

 Access to the 25-km stretch, estimated to cost Rs 700 crore, will not be open to all because of security considerations over the atomic centre. Speaking about the plan in the Assembly last week, PWD minister Anil Deshmukh said Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority would plan the project and invest Rs 500 crore in it. He claimed the multi-lane road would be the first of its kind in the country.

 Arjun was not racing: Father

 Kolkata, March 12 (PTI): Arjun Atwals father today said the golfing ace was not involved in any high-speed street race in Florida and did not know the person who died in the mishap on Saturday.

 Harminder Atwal said he spoke to his son after the accident. He is a trifle nervous, but otherwise he is ok.

 He said the police only recorded a preliminary statement from Arjun and did not have any plans to proceed on the matter. As Arjun was an eyewitness, the police recorded his statement. And that was the end of the matter. It is wrong to say he faces high-speed driving charges, he said.

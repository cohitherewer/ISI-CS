 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Festival fuss over famous daughter

M. Karunanidhi isnt known for hasty declarations, but he didnt waste too much time in announcing his poetess-daughter Kanimozhi as his deserving literary heir.

 Few would quarrel with that, but the Tamil Nadu chief ministers timing and choice of venue has kicked up a lot of dust.

 Karunanidhi was speaking at the first-ever Chennai Sangamam, a festival that has become the confluence of streams of Tamil folk art. The event played a big role in taking these art forms directly to the people. Kanimozhi is seen as the brain behind this show.

 But just a few days after the carnival, Kanimozhi unwittingly found herself locking horns with the Ficci Ladies Organisation, which claimed it had floated the idea of the Sangamam much before Kanimozhi thought of it. 

 In the scramble for credit, however, an important question was lost. Why is Karunanidhi not being as forthright to at least name, if not anoint, his political heir?

 NRI hubbies smoked out

Hyderabad police are hunting down absconding NRI wife- beaters. Last week, a special team caught Mohammed Azizullah. The all-woman squad lay in wait at the Mumbai airport, where he landed to try and give the police the slip.

 The 50-year-old, brought to Andhra last week, is charged with beating his wife for dowry and abandoning her in Hyderabad before leaving for Dubai two years ago. 

 We have alerted Interpol, which has taken serious note of those involved in domestic violence by issuing over 100 red-corner notices. It is watching their movements, says Kantha Rao, deputy commissioner (south zone). 

 More than 340 cases of wife-beating and dowry harassment have now been registered with the city police against husbands in the US, UK, Australia and Dubai. 

 The majority of these truant NRI hubbies are software engineers, doctors and businessmen from the Reddy or Kamma community, where the practice of taking and giving dowry has taken a ruthless edge, says Rao.

 School shift row in court

Parents of those studying at Arya Vidya Mandir (AVM) Girls School at Santa Cruz are an angry lot. They have taken the school management to court for its decision to merge the school with another AVM School, Bandra and make it co-educational from April. 

 Seven parents have filed a petition in Mumbai High Court challenging the state governments clearance to the merger. They have contended that the private school didnt need government sanction in the first place. 

 The trouble began when new handbooks were issued to students, saying the school will become co-educational from April 1. It also said girls from Standard III to X would attend classes at the AVM School in Bandra (West). Those in Standard II and below have been told that their classes will be held at Santa Cruz, along with boys. 

 Gift for a cause

Sonia Gandhi clapped and Usha Uthup sang. Now how about buying a necklace or top to help the cause of the girl child? 

 Internet service provider Sify has decided to donate profits earned from its special online womens store on March 8 International Womens Day to an NGO working with underprivileged girl children. 

 The womens store, offering a range of apparel, gift items, jewellery, beauty care products, home furnishings, books, magazines, watches, electronic items and more, can be accessed at www.sifymall.com. Nanhikali, the NGO, has been working for the education of destitute girls since 1996. It has 12,000 of them now.

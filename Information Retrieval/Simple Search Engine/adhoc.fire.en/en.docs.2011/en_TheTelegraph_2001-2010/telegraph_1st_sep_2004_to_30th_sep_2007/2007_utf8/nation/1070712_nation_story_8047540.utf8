 Suicide probe

 MUZAFFAR RAINA 

 Srinagar, July 11: Investigators probing the death of Captain Megha Razdan have summoned her former course-mate in Delhi, raising suspicions about a love triangle. The 26-year-old was found hanging at her flat in a Jammu army camp last week.

 The deceaseds mobile has been seized and based on the call records, the officer is being quizzed by the court of inquiry, said a source in the army. Police will also question him. Initial investigations have thrown up a long list of calls made by the officer, a police official said.

 A PTI report said the head of the police team probing the death wrote to the commanding officer of Meghas Tiger Division asking the officer to appear before them. The letter was written on July 9, a week after her death.

 Megha, her husband Captain Chaitanya Bhatwadker and the officer were course mates during training in Pune. The officer isnt from the same unit but all three are from the engineering wing, the source said. 

 The police is waiting for the forensic reports of Meghas purported suicide note and other diaries recovered from her room. The army, on other hand, expects the viscera test report to help determine the cause of her death. 

 The Police and the army are co-operating and sharing information. The reports will also be shared, the source said.

 Income tax quiz for Daler 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, March 11: Pop star Daler Mehndi was quizzed by income-tax officials minutes after his show in Surat ended last night.

 The taxmen had arrived just as the programme was about to begin at the Sardar Vallab Regional Institute of Engineering and Technology and wanted to question Mehndi on what the organisers were paying him and if he had cleared his tax liabilities. But college authorities persuaded them to wait till the show was over.

 The singer later claimed to know some of the officials and said they had come to see the programme. But a senior tax officer confirmed that Mehndi had been quizzed and they were satisfied after talking to him, although he refused to disclose how much he had received for the show. Its a students function and there is no question of making money. Mehndi said. 

 Unofficial sources said the singer was paid Rs 6 lakh.

 Chhindwara (Madhya Pradesh), Jan. 30: When the rest of the country was busy with the centenary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhis satyagraha, two South Africans, W.A. Jacob and A. Gordon, were beaten up in a tiny tribal village here for no apparent fault of theirs.

 The duo was intercepted and attacked by a group of Bajrang Dal activists in a village called Bhajipani on the ground that they were carrying beef.

 Chhindwara DIG Ashok Awasthi, however, told The Telegraph that the meat seized consisted of three broiler chickens and one and a half kg of uncooked pork.

 Gordon and Jacob, employees of Joy Construction, a mining company engaged by the Western Coalfields Limited, were going to Nagpur to catch connecting flights to Calcutta and Johannesburg, respectively. Travelling in a hired Bolero, they were intercepted at Bhajipani by the group, which began thrashing them the moment their vehicle was stopped. Driver Irfan tried to bail them out but was also beaten up.

 Eyewitness accounts said the group, while raising religious slogans, robbed the duo of their mobile phones, cash and a Rolex watch. Confirming this, Awasthi said: Yes, we have registered cases of dacoity.

 Awasthi said his men had arrested eight persons, and cases against several unnamed persons have been registered. Among those arrested is Dev Kumar Chowdhary, a local Bajrang Dal leader.

 While xenophobia and loot appear to be prime motives, police said they were probing other angles, too like the possibility of the villagers trying to settle scores with Joy Construction. The company had reportedly sacked a number of daily wagers recently on the ground of lazy conduct.

 Some villagers hinted at the possibility of extortion being the motive. They accused some Sangh parivar outfits of seeking protection money from companies operating in the area. It is possible that Joy Construction defaulted or refused to pay monthly protection money, said a local resident who did not want to be named.

 Badly bruised, Jacob left for South Africa while Gordon, the project manager, went to the Coal India office in Calcutta to take up the issue, the police said.

 Chhindwara is the parliamentary constituency of Union commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath, who is trying to promote the country and his home state as an ideal business and tourist destination. Sources close to him said incidents like these were a blot on the states reputation. 

 Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan is currently on a business tour to Tel Aviv to invite foreign investors.

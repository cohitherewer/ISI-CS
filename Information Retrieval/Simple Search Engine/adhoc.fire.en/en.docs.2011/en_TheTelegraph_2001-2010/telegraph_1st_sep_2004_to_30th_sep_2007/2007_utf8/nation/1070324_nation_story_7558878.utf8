 Smart questions for IIT entrance

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 23: The three lakh students who appear in the IIT joint entrance examination on April 8 will face questions that demand more analytical and reasoning skills compared with past years.

 The examination papers have been reduced from three to two, with each carrying questions from all three subjects: physics, chemistry and mathematics. The duration of a paper would be three hours instead of the earlier two.

 Unlike before, when all questions carried negative marks, some this time will not.

 The examination papers this year will test the students analytical and comprehension skills more than before, said Joy Deep Mukherjee, spokesperson for FITJEE, a leading coaching school for IIT aspirants. The focus will be on correct and reasoned arguments.

 Teachers say the candidates mustnt try and second-guess the paper-setters by picking specific parts of their subjects to study. The papers will cover all the areas in each subject.

 They, however, suggest that there are areas in each subject the students will do well to focus on.

 For instance, in physics, some of the important chapters are mechanics, fluids, heat and thermodynamics, waves and sound, optics, modern physics and electrostatics.

 In chemistry, the students should focus on inorganic qualitative analysis, co-ordination chemistry, chemical bonding, physical electro-chemistry and the whole of organic chemistry.

 In mathematics, the key areas are complex numbers, probability, vectors, parabola and hyperbola in geometry, and application of derivatives as well as differentiation in calculus.

 Mukherjee warns students against making blind guesses. The students should give enough thought to each of the alternative questions. They should attempt questions they can fully answer.

 There are over 4,000 seats in the seven IITs. The number is expected to increase this year as the institutes begin implementing the 27 per cent quota for the other backward classes.

 According to the coaching school, the rise in examinees will outstrip the rise in seats, with the seat-candidate ratio falling from last years 1:55 to 1:74.

 The IIT entrance examination system has seen many changes over the years. Last year, the Union human resource development ministry had introduced a one-stage examination replacing the earlier two-stage system that included a screening test before the main examination.

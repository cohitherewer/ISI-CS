 Valley cut off

 Srinagar, Feb. 26: The Kashmir valley is grappling with a crisis as its only road link with the country has been cut off for the last six days. 

 The 300-km Srinagar-Jammu National Highway was blocked on February 21 after landslides damaged a stretch of this crucial link at Panthihal, 130 km from here. 

 The closure has led to severe shortage of essential commodities including vegetables, milk, pulses, mutton and chicken.

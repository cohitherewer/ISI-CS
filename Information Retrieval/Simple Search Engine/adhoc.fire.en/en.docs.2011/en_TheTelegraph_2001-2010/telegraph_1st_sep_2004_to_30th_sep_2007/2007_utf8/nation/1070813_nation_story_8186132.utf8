 Only facts on House floor

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 New Delhi, Aug. 12: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to make a factual and not a political statement on the nuclear deal when Parliament meets tomorrow.

 Sources said the Prime Minister is likely to stick to a clinical presentation as he does not want to exacerbate the standoff with the Left in any way.

 Singhs statement in both Houses will be made in the afternoon, provided a political storm over Goa does not derail the days proceedings.

 Under the circumstances, the Prime Minister will essentially iterate details of the 123 Agreement that have already been put out in the public domain by national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and Indias nuclear establishment.

 First, Singh will state that the agreement meets all the requirements and addresses all the concerns of the House.

 He will point out that the agreement is only about civilian nuclear energy issues between the two countries, how the US has agreed to uninterrupted fuel supplies to Indias safeguarded civil nuclear energy reactors and how Washington has promised to commit alternative supplies from Russia, France and the UK in case the agreement has to cease because of unforeseen circumstances.

 He is expected to point to his own statement on August 17 last year, including one by Sitaram Yechury who had then said that if Indias top scientists were happy, the Left would also be satisfied.

 The Prime Ministers statement will imply that Indias strategic independence will not be compromised and that the 123 Agreement has nothing to do with Indias military programme. 

 Other speakers may come up with more assertive statements during the debate that will take place on Tuesday and Wednesday in Parliament.

 No threat: Pranab

 External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee said there are serious differences with the Left on the nuclear deal but these could be resolved through talks.

 There is no threat to the government. We are trying to sort out the differences with the Left, he said in Hooghly.

 The Left parties would not withdraw support, Mukherjee said. The Left is supporting us from outside to keep the BJP at bay, he said.

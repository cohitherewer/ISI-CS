 Maya sets lunch date with PM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 24: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over lunch on Saturday.

 The Bahujan Samaj Party leader will be visiting Delhi tomorrow for the first time since being sworn in chief minister on May 13.

 Congress sources could not confirm if Sonia Gandhi would be present at the meeting in the Prime Ministers residence as she is scheduled to campaign in Goa on that day.

 A source in the Uttar Pradesh government said Mayavati was unlikely to make any other political calls during her visit. There is no meeting scheduled with Sonia or Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

 The source said Mayavati would raise three or four important issues with Singh relating to economics, agriculture and development.

 Congress leaders see in the meeting a positive signal from the BSP chief in the run-up to the presidential election.

 The BSPs chunk of over 60,000 votes in the presidential electoral college is expected to give the Congress an added cushion. 

 But more than numbers, the Congress wants to make a larger political point of having a Dalit ally on its side in the countrys most politically crucial state.

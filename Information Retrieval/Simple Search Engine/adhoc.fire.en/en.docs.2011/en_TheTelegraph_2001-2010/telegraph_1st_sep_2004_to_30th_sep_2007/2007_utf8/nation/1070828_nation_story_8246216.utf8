 Congress gets company

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 27: L.K. Advani has gifted the Congress the climbdown it had been waiting for.

 Expecting no major retreat in the Lefts stand, Congress sources admitted that the partys greatest fear was total isolation in Parliament if the BJP took a strident stand.

 It would have underlined the Congresss isolation before the country, all the more because the Lefts principal contention is that if a majority of the MPs are opposed to the deal, what legitimacy does it have? said a Congress minister. 

 Advanis declaration that the BJP had no objection to a strategic partnership with the US so long as it served Indias interest took care of the Congresss problem to an extent. 

 The BJP carried the views enunciated by Advani in Hyderabad forward in a discussion at the Indo-US Forum of Parliamentarians in the capital. 

 When Congress spokesman Abhishek Manu Singhvi pleaded that the Indo-US relationship should not be pegged to the deal, his BJP counterpart agreed. 

 There is a whole big world in the Indo-US relationship which we should not overlook. Indo-US amity was initiated by the NDA government and if the Congress takes it forward, we are sure to support it, the BJPs Ravi Shankar Prasad said.

 However, when the debate takes place in Parliament, there is an unstated understanding in the UPA that its attack should target the BJP, not the Left.

 The Congresss star speakers such as Kapil Sibal and Singhvi have already mustered their arguments against the BJP.

 A principal point the Congress has been stressing was how the NDA government had clinched a series of agreements with the US but Parliament was never taken into confidence.

 The spadework for the deal was carried out by the NDA government but we got a much better bargain from the US than they had hoped for, Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh said.

 The other cause for some cheer in the Congress was the fact that the BJPs Maharashtra ally, the Shiv Sena, openly backed the deal. 

 So did the Biju Janata Dal. Its Rajya Sabha member, B.J. Panda, spoke glowingly of the deal at the forum and said it marked a complete change of paradigm by making available energy that had been denied to us.

 Parliament apart, the Congress feels that the BJPs anti-deal postures had not gone down well with the Opposition partys urban middle and upper class constituencies. The worldly aspiration of these classes are inspired by the US, a source said.

 Industry, too, has been flummoxed by the BJPs opposition to the deal, according to Congress sources.

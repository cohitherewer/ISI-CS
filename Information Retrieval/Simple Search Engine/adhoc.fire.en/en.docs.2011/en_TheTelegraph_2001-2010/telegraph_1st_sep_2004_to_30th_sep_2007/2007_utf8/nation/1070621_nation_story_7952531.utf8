rescue

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 20: True to the Hindi-Chini Bhai Bhai spirit, tourism and culture minister Ambika Soni today rushed to the rescue of a visiting Chinese minister as he run into a barrage of questions on black-topping an existing road to the Everest base camp.

 Chinas culture minister Sun Jiazheng was here to sign a cultural exchange programme that includes festivals in both countries and visits by artists over the next two years.

 After the ceremony, he was asked about the possible environmental impact of the road project. 

 Sun appeared ready with an answer, but Ambika Soni was still keen to help.

 Through his interpreter, the Chinese minister asserted that building infrastructure for transport was important for the development of the region and the convenience of its people.

 At this point, however, Soni cut short the interpreter, telling reporters that the Chinese and Indians were here to sign a cultural exchange agreement and that was all that had been discussed at the meeting.

 I would appeal to the media to restrict their questions to art and culture, she said. 

 A short while later, Sun and his delegation were ushered to lunch, an India-China affair.

 Answering another question, Soni said the tourism ministry was still pushing for visas on arrival for visitors from some countries. The home ministry which has objected to it for years is now said to be looking at the proposal more favourably.

 As a possible initial step, the Centre had introduced five-year multiple-entry visas for tourists from 18 countries.

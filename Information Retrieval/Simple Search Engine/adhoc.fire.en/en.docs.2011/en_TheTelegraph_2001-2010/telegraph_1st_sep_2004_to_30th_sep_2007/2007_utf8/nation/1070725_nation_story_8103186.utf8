 Girls body in bed box

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 24: A final-year engineering student recovering from a foot injury at home was found dead last Friday, her trussed-up body stuffed into the storage box of a bed.

 Snehal Gavare went missing on July 19 from her home in a Dombivili neighbourhood. Parents back from work that evening did not find the 21-year-old in the house, where she was cooped up since hurting her leg a month back.

 Kalpana and Hindurao Gavare lodged a missing persons diary the same night.

 But it was Kalpana who got the shock when she stumbled on the body while trying to tuck in a garment that had been sticking out from the storage box. The mouth was gagged and the hands had been tied behind the back.

 Kalpana, a schoolteacher, recalls having received a blank SMS from her daughters cellphone on Thursday evening. I was in a meeting so I couldnt call her back. When I returned home, she wasnt there. When I called, her cellphone was not reachable, she said.

 Preliminary post-mortem reports indicate that the death was caused by asphyxiation. Police suspect the involvement of two or more assailants and believe the victim knew them there were no signs of forced entry.

 The police have found the missing cellphone, but not the SIM card. Call details are being studied for clues.

 Snehals friends have told the investigators that she had a boyfriend, Hiren Rathod, and that the couple planned to get married. Hiren, a Voltas employee, knew Snehal since December 2005. He had studied at the same college.

 The police said that Hiren was in office on Thursday, but they are trying to determine whether he could be involved. We have found that the two had been planning to get married, said senior inspector Prakash Kawade of Dombivilis Ramnagar police station.

 What has intrigued the police is that the assassins took time to stuff Snehals body inside the bed and even went as far as rearranging the clothes and other items. This has raised many questions about the intention, said Kawade.

 The police have also found evidence to suggest that the Gavares did not have a happy marriage. Two years ago, Snehals elder sister, Sheetal, who is studying in the UK, had lodged an assault complaint with the police against her father. This was done on behalf of her mother. 

 SC rap for police

 The Supreme Court has asked for the suspension of policemen who fail to register FIRs on citizens complaints. 

 The apex court cited an incident at Connaught Place, where a gang of bikers who had created terror were arrested after considerable delay, as a classic case of police inaction.

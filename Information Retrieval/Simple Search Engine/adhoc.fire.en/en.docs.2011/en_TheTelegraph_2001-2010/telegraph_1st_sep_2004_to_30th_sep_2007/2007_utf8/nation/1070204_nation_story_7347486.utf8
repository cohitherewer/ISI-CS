 Long tongue 

 Kochi, Feb. 3 (PTI): A man whose tongue was about 13.5 cm long and 12 cm wide claimed to be the longest in the world was shortened by doctors after a surgery.

 An abnormal growth of blood vessels had caused an enlargement of the tongue and lips, due to which Suresh Kumar, 44, could not close his mouth properly, speak or eat normally for 29 years, said doctors who did the surgery in December. 

 The doctors said Suresh was suffering from hemangioma, a congenital tumour of blood vessels, because of which his tongue was unusually large.

 Rejig push for nuclear command

 SUJAN DUTTA 

 New Delhi, Aug. 11: A parliamentary report on defence has set the ball rolling for restructuring the countrys nuclear weapons command that was on the anvil in any case after Indias nuclear installations are placed under a safeguards regime following the 123 Agreement with the US. 

 The parliamentary standing committee on defence has said in a report that the Strategic Forces Command (SFC) theoretically the custodian of all nuclear weapons and their delivery systems should be given adequate flexibility. 

 The committee made a specific mention of the SFC but said all defence formations like it should be given the responsibility and the powers to take decisions on measures to counter new military threats. 

 The standing committee report was prepared before the 123 Agreement with the US was initialled. 

 But the timing of its release is just right for the defence establishment and the Nuclear Command Authority (NCA) to begin reforming the military-nuclear set-up. The NCA was created on January 4, 2003. It is headed by the Prime Minister. 

 Following the deal and a safeguards agreement that India will have to sign with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Delhi will have to separate its military and civilian nuclear facilities. Civilian facilities will be subject to international safeguards and inspections. 

 The SFC was set up in 2003 but was proposed to be created shortly after the nuclear tests of May 1998. Like the Integrated Defence Staff, the Unified Command and the Defence Intelligence Agency, it is also a tri-service agency staffed by the three forces. 

 A review committee and a group of ministers after the 1999 Kargil war had recommended that all these agencies should be headed by a chief of defence staff. But neither have the armed forces articulated their final views on the recommendation nor has the government been able to work out a political consensus on creating the post of chief of defence staff so far. 

 Since 2004, the SFC has been under the Nuclear Command Authority. It is temporarily based in Delhi but a secret headquarters for it is to be formed elsewhere. 

 The parliamentary committee that placed its report yesterday has also called for a review of all the tri-service commands. A team of experts should examine the working of each of these organisations to ensure their efficiency and also to have synergy, it said. 

 The Defence Intelligence Agency, which primarily collates inputs from defence attaches in Indian missions, should also strengthen surveillance through satellites, the report recommended.

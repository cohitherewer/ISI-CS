 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 House revived, home missing

 A new House to frame laws, but no homes for those elected to it Andhra Pradesh has a housing problem.

 The legislative council, wound up in 1985 when N. T. Rama Rao found it stalling his laws, was revived recently. Now, authorities are struggling to find ways to allot the councils 90 new members government quarters. Trouble is, a third of the 400 quarters have been razed to make way for a skyscraper; an equal number of them are occupied by leaders who lost elections two years back. We have issued notices. The deadline to vacate is March 31, says legislative affairs minister K. Rosaiah. 

 The YSR government claims it has no money for legislators houses. With irrigation projects of Rs 60,000 crore and plans for 40 lakh houses by 2009, it may not be lying. Recently, it pawned a stadium to fund a sporting event.

 But the new members neednt despair. Till they are given a place, they might just have to choose between Nizam Club or Fateh Maidan Club. The homeless have rarely been so lucky.

 Tube on its way south

 Upscale south Delhi is likely to get the Metro on time, thanks to the Commonwealth Games. Underground stations are planned for Hauz Khas, Green Park and Malviya Nagar by March 2010. The plan is part of the efforts to turn Delhi into a world-class city for the Games.

 The metro connects north, east and west, but those in the citys south have often complained about being left out.

 Most of the Games venues are in south and central Delhi, while the Games village is in the eastern part. Sources in the urban development ministry said the link to the south is essential and delays in construction of the Metro wont be permitted.

 Larsen and Toubro is building this phase, and sources say the company had to face little red tape that often dogs such massive infrastructure projects.

 Nursing a miracle

 For Prema, midwifery couldnt have been cheaper. And, for government hospitals, where babies should ideally be born and mothers taken care of, this was a reminder that the healthcare system is yet to deliver the goods.

 When the 30-year-old from a Cuddalore village went into labour recently, her relatives rushed her in a three-wheeler to the government hospital at Nellikuppam. But to their shock, they found no doctors or nurses there. 

 They realised they would have to get to Cuddalore district hospital. As they were racing to the town, Prema couldnt bear the pangs, forcing her folks to stop midway.

 After that, it was native ingenuity and maternal instincts at play. A flimsy screen, made from saris pulled out of Premas bag, was strung up as the women accompanying her turned midwives instantly. A beautiful baby girl was born right there. Perfect delivery.

 Ammas tips

 Farmer suicides are giving Vilasrao Deshmukh sleepless nights. But the Maharashtra chief minister now has help from an unusual source Mata Amritanandmayi.

 Amma, as she is affectionately called by her devotees, met Deshmukh on Thursday, and announced a Rs 200-crore plan to deal with farmer suicides in Maharashtra, Kerala and other states facing an agricultural crisis. 

 But the problem cant be solved through economic packages alone. What is needed is social and spiritual interventions so farmers realise that suicide is not the way out, Amma said. Deshmukh couldnt have agreed more.

 Delhi: The beaches of the Mediterranean, the heights of the Himalayas and the long autumn nights of Finland, in brown, red, blue and white artist Devendras extracts are on display at the Lalit Kala Academy from 11 am to 7 pm till March 20.

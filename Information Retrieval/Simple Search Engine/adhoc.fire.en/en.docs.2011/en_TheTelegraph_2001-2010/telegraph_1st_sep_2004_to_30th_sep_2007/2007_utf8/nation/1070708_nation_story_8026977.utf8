 Rahul on Cuba health mission

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 7: Rahul Gandhi was in Cuba this week to study the islands healthcare system and see which of its aspects could be assimilated in India. 

 The Congress MP was keen to learn how Cuba handles its HIV-AIDS programme, given that its entire health administration is financed by the state. 

 The trip came about after a suggestion from UNAIDS, with which his mother Sonia Gandhi has been associated. 

 Rahuls sojourn was interspersed with official meetings, including one with Cuban foreign minister Felipe Perez Roque on Tuesday. 

 He also met the president of the Cuban parliament, Ricardo Alaracon and health minister Jose Ramon Balaguer. But there has been no word yet on whether he met Fidel Castro or his brother Raul. 

 The official media stressed on Rahuls lineage with references to Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia. 

 The website of Radio Habana Cuba quoted Rahul and the Cuban foreign minister as discussing the positive development of the ties between the two countries as well as healthcare. 

 The Cuban healthcare system is a near reversal of the one in India the entire population of the island receives free preventive, curative and rehabilitation.

 The services range from primary care, routine medical checks and dentistry to hospital care, which require the use of highly sophisticated medical technologies. 

 Although an aide of Rahul admitted it would not be possible to replicate the Cuban model overnight even partially, the young MP might be looking at whether he can implement aspects of it in the healthcare services he has started in Amethi, his constituency. 

 Besides, he reportedly believes that despite the takeover of health by the private sector, the state can still intervene meaningfully through programmes such as the National Rural Health Care Mission and increased budgetary allocations.

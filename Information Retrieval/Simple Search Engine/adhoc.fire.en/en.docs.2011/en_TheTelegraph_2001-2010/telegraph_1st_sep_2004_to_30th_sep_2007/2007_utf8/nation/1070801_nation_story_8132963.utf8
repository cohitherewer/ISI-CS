 New Delhi, July 31: Sanjay Dutts lawyers could explore any or all of three distinct legal options to save the actor from the six-year prison term pronounced today, legal experts say. 

 Sanjays lawyers in Mumbai said they would seek relief from the Supreme Court. 

 A petition seeking bail is almost certain to be the first step to be taken by the lawyers, the experts said. Bail will allow Sanjay to move out of the Arthur Road jailhouse, and get back temporarily at least to his film projects. 

 Unlike fellow convicts in the 1993 Bombay blasts case who have been convicted under anti-terror law Tada, Sanjay, the experts say, stands a better chance of being granted bail. 

 Even the convicts under Tada are entitled to bail, but since Dutt has not been convicted for terrorist activities, he is likely to stand a better chance of bail, lawyer and human rights activist Teesta Setalvad said. Setalvad has handled several terrorism-related cases. 

 Simultaneously, the lawyers are likely to appeal in the Supreme Court against the judgment convicting Sanjay under the Arms Act, for the illegal possession of an AK-56 rifle and a revolver. 

 The actors chances of bail increase if the appeal is admitted as it implies that the court believes there is merit in re-evaluating the case. 

 If bail is denied, Sanjay will have to spend time in prison while the appeal is being argued in the apex court. 

 Finally, the lawyers may also seek probation. They will have to appeal to the Supreme Court that his conduct in jail he has already spent 18 months out of the six years he was today sentenced to has been exemplary, so he should be put on probation. 

 In India, we do not have a system where a court can commute a sentence. Only the President can commute the sentence. Courts can only grant probation, lawyer Indira Jaisingh said. 

 Under probation, Sanjay will be out of jail but will need to spend the full duration of his sentence as a model citizen without breaking any law. Even a traffic violation can get him back in prison to serve the remainder of his term four-and-a-half years since he has already spent 18 months in jail.

 So his lawyers are likely to seek probation only if they are convinced he is unlikely to be exonerated by the apex court. 

 The appeal for probation will come once it becomes clear to Dutts lawyers that he will be found guilty under the Arms Act even by the Supreme Court. Appeal for probation is tantamount to accepting guilt, Jaisingh said. 

 Lawyer Prashant Bhushan called the sentence against Sanjay harsh. 

 But Sanjays lawyer Satish Maneshinde told reporters in Mumbai the actor was prepared. We had prepared him, Maneshinde said, adding that the legal team would be further reinforced before the appeals in the Supreme Court.

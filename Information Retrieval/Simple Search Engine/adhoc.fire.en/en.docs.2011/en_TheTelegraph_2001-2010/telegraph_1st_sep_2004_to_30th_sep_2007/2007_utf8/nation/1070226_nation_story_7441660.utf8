 CBI rush to meet Q date

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 25: Under fire for its two-week delay in announcing Ottavio Quattrocchis detention in Argentina, the CBI today scrambled to give an impression that it had stepped on the gas to bring the fugitive Italian businessman back to India.

 The investigative agency said a two-member team would leave for Argentina on February 28 to file the extradition case against the last remaining Bofors accused. The journey is expected to take almost a whole day.

 The extradition request must be initiated by March 7 before the 30-day deadline from the day of detention passes. Quattrocchi was held on February 6 on the basis of an Interpol red-corner notice.

 The CBI, now in a rush to prepare the papers for the extradition proceedings, indicated it would take two more days to finish the job. Some of the documents, mainly relating to the Bofors case details and Quattrocchis alleged involvement in it, have been handed over to the foreign ministry.

 But there is scepticism in Delhi over the strength of the CBIs case. Despite Bofors being a huge political scandal, the legal case does not stand firm on its feet even in India. All Quattrocchis co-accused have either died or been exonerated by Delhi High Court.

 The CBI has already lost one extradition case against the Italian in Malaysia, and Delhi was last year accused of helping him get his London bank accounts defrozen.

 People associated with the case in the past believe that the CBI has not found anything new that may be presented to Buenos Aires.

 The governments delay in making Quattrocchis detention public has given the Opposition a stick to beat it with during the budget session.

 The Opposition is expected to raise the issue in Parliament tomorrow, when the railway budget is to be presented. V.K. Malhotra of the BJP said his party had asked for suspension of question hour in the Lok Sabha on the issue.

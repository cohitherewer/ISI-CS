 Preity can plead, city wont vote

 Mumbai, Feb. 1: The memory of the floods and train blasts prodded and Preity Zinta pushed. But Mumbai remained unmoved.

 The city recorded the lowest turnout among the 10 municipal corporations that went to the polls in Maharashtra today, languishing at 45 per cent while Thane and Pune saw 60 and suicide-wracked Vidharbhas Akola and Amravati topped at 65.

 Zinta had made an appeal through a newspaper asking Mumbai to vote, and many had thought the recollection of the mismanagement after the July 2005 deluge and the blasts last year would stir the voter into action.

 But apart from a brisk few hours in the western suburbs that bore the brunt of the 2005 cloudburst, the booths stayed largely forlorn.

 Yet, if the polling stations lacked in substance, they di-dnt lack in style. The star cast of voters at Bandra West would have left the line-up of candidates miles behind on the popularity charts.

 Sanjay Dutt, Aamir Khan and Zinta stood in the queues; so did veterans Saira Banu and Rishi Kapoor and filmmakers Kunal Kohli and Rakeysh Mehra.

 Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, who has virtually been living on the sets of Kaun Banega Crorepati, stayed away. But santoor maestro Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma turned up, as did another maestro. Fresh from his hundred at Vadodara, Sachin Tendulkar voted with wife Anjali.

 If Bandra West was about glamour, Bandra East was serious business. Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray stepped into the booth near his Kala Nagar residence just before noon, with son Uddhav and daughters-in-law Rashmi, Smita and Madhavi.

 For the Sena, this election is a battle for survival after the rebellions by Raj Thackeray and Narayan Rane. Stray violence between the supporters of Raj and Uddhav was reported from central Mumbai and the western fringes.

 If Mumbai ignored some of its memories, the voter list forgot the states first citizen. Governor S.M. Krishna couldnt vote because his name was missing from the rolls. Raj Bhavan and the state election panel traded blame for failing to get Krishna transferred from the Karnataka rolls.

 Lyricist Gulzar met the same fate despite being a voter for the last 30 years.

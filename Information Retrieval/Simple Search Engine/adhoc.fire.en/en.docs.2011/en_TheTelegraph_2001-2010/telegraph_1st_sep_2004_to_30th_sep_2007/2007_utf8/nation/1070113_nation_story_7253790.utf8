The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Rush after kit horse bolts

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 12: Calcutta police have rushed a team to New Delhi to challenge the bail granted to a suspect in the faulty medical kit case.

 But other officers said that if the same alacrity was shown in the investigations, such a scurry to the Supreme Court could have been avoided.

 Ghanshyam Sarda, the brother of prime accused Govind, was granted bail yesterday by Calcutta High Court after a test report could not find fault with kit samples, which the police said were either past their use-by date or were tampered with.

 The blow to the police came despite chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee finding the charges grave enough to ask for a CBI probe and police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee terming the alleged racket an act of genocide.

 The police had expressed concern that thousands of people might have been given blood tested with faulty Hepatitis B and C and HIV kits. 

 A senior IPS officer blamed complacency of investigators for the setback in the court. 

 The detectives work has been sloppy. Why did they not send samples of the faulty kits to the National Institute of Biologicals (NIB) as well as the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) so that the reports could be matched? he asked. The NIBs report had given the kits the clean chit. 

 Even after seizing hundreds of faulty kits, the investigators sat for a over a month before sending them to the NIB, he said.

 Such was the complacency that they did not seek expert opinion before sending the samples to the NIB, he said. 

 The police are expected to contest the bail in the Supreme Court tomorrow. We are not satisfied with the NIB report and are waiting for a reply from them about the presentation and the format, an officer said.

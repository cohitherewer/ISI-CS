 Torn between study amp; baby, doctor hugs death 

 ANANYA SENGUPTA

 Mumbai, April 11: A young 

 doctor has killed herself and her six-month-old daughter, 

 unable to come to terms with early motherhood that stood 

 in the way of higher studies.

 The tragedy brings into sharp focus a problem many a woman face: how to juggle career and home without one affecting the other.

 Radhika Harote, 26, jumped off her seventh-floor apartment in suburban Mumbai last night, shortly after poisoning to death her daughter Siddhi, police said. 

 An MBBS, Radhika wanted to pursue the masters course in surgery. However, her mother apparently persuaded her to postpone her plans and have a baby. She had been married to Sameer Harote, a surgeon posted near Nagpur, for two years.

 Radhikas family has told us that she was upset about the birth of the baby less than two years after her marriage and saw it as a hindrance to her studies. There were certain complications during the delivery and she suffered from chikungunya during pregnancy, said T. Shinde, the investigating officer at Charkop police station in western Mumbai.

 A few months after Siddhi was born, Radhika decided to realise her dream. But she couldnt get enough time to study for her postgraduation exam, the officer said. Frustrated, she decided to take her life after killing her baby. 

 Radhikas case is not an isolated one. Swati Thathe, a 24-year-old teacher, had to look after her ailing in-laws at home. When the pressure got to her, she had a nervous breakdown in her school.

 After recovering, Swati became irritable and short-tempered. She once hit a student and was suspended from school. Soon after, she leaped to death from her apartment.

 When she came to me, she was suffering from borderline anxiety. She had threatened to commit suicide more than once, but no one took the symptoms seriously, said psychiatrist Harish Shetty.

 The problem is that working women in our country are expected to be perfect in their household chores, even at the cost of their careers. 

 Having a baby, taking care of the husband and the in-laws are expected to be their prime focus. More and more highly educated women in this country are falling prey to suicides because they have this constant urge to find meaning in life through their careers while the people around them feel otherwise, he added.

 Psychotherapists say lack of emotional support is the primary reason why these women are becoming afflicted by depression. 

 Besides, the profile of the Indian woman has witnessed a sea change, according to experts. They are more confident and ambitious. When they dont get what they want, they feel depressed and cheated, the experts say.

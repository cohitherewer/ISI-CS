 Murder over cuppa

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Feb. 25: Blood was spilt over tea and juice in a swanky Guwahati restaurant this evening as a conversation between three men turned into an argument and one of them ended up with a bullet in his neck.

 Waiters and other guests at Hotel Ambarish were dumbstruck as one of the two men who were with the victim fired the fatal shot and fled. 

 A waiter at the restaurant said everything happened in a trice. I heard a gunshot and turned around to see the guest slumping back in his chair. I cant tell you more. We are all in a state of shock. 

 One of his colleagues said the man with the firearm warned those present in the restaurant there were about 10 more customers against trying to come near him as he hurried out. Stay put or I will shoot, he quoted the man as saying.

 But according to a second eyewitness, the killer walked out of the restaurant without uttering a word while the other man contemplated what to do. 

 On being confronted, the third man told me he was going to inform the police about the incident. He said the same to the security personnel at the gate. As the guards rushed up the stairs, he disappeared, the witness said.

 Additional superintendent of police Rajen Singh said the victim was Mohammad Akhtar Shah from Imphal West, according to the driving licence found on him. Some other documents found on him indicate political connections in Manipur. 

 The trio had gone to the restaurant at Ganeshguri, among the busiest areas of the city, in a white Santro around 6 pm. Waiters told the police that the victim used to visit the restaurant occasionally. 

 The police have conjectured that the killer did not return in the car. We presume it was his companion who drove away. We are trying to trace the vehicle, a member of the investigation team said.

 The police team arrived at the scene of crime 45 minutes after the incident. 

 Hotel Ambarish, barely a km from Dispur, is known to be one of the favourite haunts of politicians. Its first brush with scandal was when the late Digen Bora, a minister in the erstwhile AGP government, was found unconscious in a room with a couple of women.

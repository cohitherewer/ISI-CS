 Harass rap on world tour operator

 - Rs 80000-fine slapped 

 The Champs Elysees, a popular tourist destination in France

 New Delhi, March 11 (PTI): A couple from Delhi who were stranded in France and overcharged during a world tour have been awarded Rs 80,000 as compensation by the state consumer commission after it found the international tour operator guilty of unfair trade practice.

 The compensation must be paid within a month, the commission ruled.

 When a person is in a foreign land, he is completely at the mercy of the tour operator and to extract extra money without having informed the customers about the actual cost causes mental agony, harassment and emotional suffering, said the commission, headed by Justice J.D. Kapoor.

 Dismissing the tour operators appeal, Justice Kapoor said: The impression was given that the complainants would incur the cost as per the brochure, but they were stranded in a foreign land and various demands were made which doubled the cost of the tour.

 B.L. Gupta and Saroj Gupta, residents of Rohini, had booked an international tour package with Club-7 Holidays in May 1995 and paid them for air tickets and other facilities, including food, lodging and sightseeing. 

 But they were left stranded in France and were neither given proper accommodation nor vegetarian food as promised by the operator, the complaint alleged.

 The Guptas were also charged extra on the pretext of increased air fare and towards food and lodging in London.

 In the year 2000, a lower court had directed the tour operator to pay Rs 80,000 to the Guptas, which included a refund of the sum overcharged under different heads and compensation for mental agony and harassment.

 The operator who denied adopting any unfair trade practice had appealed against the award to the state consumer commission.

 It argued that the Guptas were supposed to pay extra sums for visa insurance, taxes and some other services. But the commission rejected the plea.

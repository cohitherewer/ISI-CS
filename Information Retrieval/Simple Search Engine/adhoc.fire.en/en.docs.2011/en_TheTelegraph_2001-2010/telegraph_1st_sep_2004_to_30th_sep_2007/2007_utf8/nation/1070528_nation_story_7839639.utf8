 Karat smells ploy in minority panels

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 27: The governments move to form panels to implement the Sachar committee report is a tactic to postpone acting on its recommendations for Muslim welfare, the CPM said today.

 With the decision by the Union cabinet to constitute four committees to go into the details of the Sachar committee report, the whole issue has been postponed indefinitely, party general secretary Prakash Karat said. 

 He said the UPA government had failed to take any practical steps to implement the recommendations. 

 Seven months have passed since the Justice Rajinder Sachar Committee submitted its report to the government. But the government has not taken any action or practical steps on it so far. The government is not sincere. There is a need for will power, Karat told a convention on the Sachar committee report. 

 The panels findings had highlighted the low socio-economic and educational status of Muslims, who account for 13.4 per cent of the countrys population.

 On May 17, the cabinet, while approving the recommendations, decided to set up the four expert panels.

 One committee would examine and determine the structure and functions of an equal opportunity commission. Another would recommend an appropriate diversity index to promote diversity in living, educational and work spaces. 

 The third would plan and monitor implementation of a comprehensive programme for skill and entreneurship development. The fourth would devise strategies to address deficiencies in civic amenities and infrastructure in towns with a substantial minority population. 

 As an indication of the Centres lack of political will, Karat pointed out its failure to hold a discussion on the Sachar report in the budget session despite the Prime Ministers assurance to Left leaders.

 The Prime Minister had assured a CPM delegation that the Sachar report would be discussed in the budget session. But unfortunately no discussion has taken place. 

 The CPM leader also rejected the UPA governments claim that the report could not be discussed because of the BJPs opposition and frequent disruption of House proceedings. If the ruling party had wanted, it would have been discussed in Parliament.

 Karat also asked the UPA government to debunk the campaign of the BJP on Muslim appeasement and give people the true picture about the condition of the community in the country. 

 Referring to the post-Godhra riots, Karat said the CPM had asked the government to tell the Supreme Court that except the Best Bakery case, all others should be handed over to the CBI. But so far, the home ministry has not taken any step on that, he said.

 Rolls Royce of a toilet

 The seat and its controller

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: If you want to live life king-size, Yoshinori Tanaka has just the throne to start you off on your day.

 The Rs 26,000 toilet-seat cover comes with a heater, a drier, a special spray nozzle and a deodoriser.

 At a technology fair in Delhi, where vendors of fancy cars and hand-held gizmos are jostling for eyeballs, the Japanese salesman has been trying to entice people to upgrade a crucial but unsung part of their daily life.

 Ive heard that Indians are soon going to have a lot of money, which is why were here, Tanaka says in broken English to visitors to his stall at the India Engineering and Technology Fair.

 We hope to firm up a distributor by the end of this year, adds the representative of Inax Corporation, the Japanese advanced toilet-seat manufacturer.

 Attached with a multi-functional sensor, the toilet seat offers the comfort of what Tanaka describes as a three-jet posterior wash on a heated toilet seat.

 It also features a special feminine wash a separate, special nozzle to eject a softer spray of warm water. The heater comes with a temperature sensor that prevents overheated water from being sprayed.

 When the jobs done, the user can look forward to a blast of warm air to keep everything fine and dry. A fan sucks out odours while a nozzle spurts a deodorant into the bowl.

 Most fair visitors, looking for the sleekest cars and latest electronic gadgetry, first seem puzzled when a smiling Tanaka beckons them to his Rolls Royce among toilet seats. But their doubts dont last long.

 The low-wattage, mechanised seat is built to the strictest safety standards for years of trouble-free use not to speak of peace of mind says the brochure that Tanaka hands to his visitors.

 The lid wont ever bang shut but will gently lower itself onto the seat when a sensor detects that the user has finished.

 Tanaka hopes to start by selling his product to five-star hotels and multiplexes and perhaps shopping centres. But he hopes to eventually invade the urban Indian home.

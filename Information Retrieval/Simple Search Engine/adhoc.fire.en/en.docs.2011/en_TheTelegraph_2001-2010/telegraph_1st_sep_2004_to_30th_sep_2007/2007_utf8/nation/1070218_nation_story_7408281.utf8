 Congress fires legal barbs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: As the Congress today pitched for Presidents rule in Uttar Pradesh, Kapil Sibal harped on three legal arguments.

 The Union minister said the Supreme Court verdict did not confine itself to disqualification of the 13 the first group among the 40 rebel BSP members who crossed over.

 Recounting events before Mulayam Singh Yadav proved his majority, Sibal said on August 27, 2003, 13 BSP legislators had informed the governor that they would support the Samajwadi Party. It was then that Mulayam was told to go in for a trial of strength.

 But S.P. Maurya, a BSP legislator, had soon after pointed out to the Speaker that the 13 rebels did not constitute the one-third needed to legalise a split and should be disqualified. The BSP had 109 members.

 Sibal said the court had held that the so-called split was illegal. It referred to a majority judgment of Allahabad High Court that if the 13 original rebels were disqualified, the remaining defectors, too, would be because at no stage did they constitute a one-third group to fulfil the requirements of the anti-defection law.

 Sibals second argument was that the floor test Mulayam was seeking on February 26 was illegal because the court deemed his government to be illegal.

 The third argument Sibal made had to do with the Bommai judgment of the apex court, which held that a floor test alone could establish whether a government had lost its majority. This was not relevant in Mulayams case, he said, because it has no meaning for a party and a CM who never came to power or came in through illegal means.

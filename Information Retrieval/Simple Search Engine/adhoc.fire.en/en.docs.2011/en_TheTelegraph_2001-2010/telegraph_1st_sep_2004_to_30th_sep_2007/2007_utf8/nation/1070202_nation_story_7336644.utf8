 Essar pipeline fire kills 4

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Feb. 1: A flash fire in an oil pipeline in Jamnagars Essar refinery killed four labourers last night.

 The fire broke out around 12.30 am when at least 100 contract labourers were welding the pipeline at the Vadinar terminal, from where crude oil is supplied to the main processing unit.

 The blaze lasted only 10 to 15 minutes but generated enormous heat, charring the four to death and injuring 16, five of them critically. The companys fire brigade extinguished the fire in 40 minutes.

 The seriously injured were airlifted to Mumbai and admitted to Lilavati Hospital. Three others were taken to Jamnagars Guru Govind Hospital.

 The main refinery, 3 km from the accident site, has not been affected by the fire and is functioning normally, said a spokesman for Essar Oil.

 Jamnagar superintendent of police Piyush Patel said a case of accidental death has been registered. Government fire safety and health officials are carrying out a probe. 

 The company, too, has set up a four-member team to probe the fire, which burnt a small portion of the pipeline. The pipeline is expected to be fixed in the next three days. 

 Essar sources said a naphtha leak might have caused a spark that grew into the blaze.

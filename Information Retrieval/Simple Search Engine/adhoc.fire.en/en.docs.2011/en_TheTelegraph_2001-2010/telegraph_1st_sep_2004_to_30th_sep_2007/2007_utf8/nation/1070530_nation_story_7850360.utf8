 Uneasy tidings for Sanjay

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 29: In some ways, Ehsan and Ayub Qureshi faced the same charges as Sanjay Dutt in the 1993 Bombay blasts.

 The Qureshis were given a five-year jail term today and fined Rs 25,000 each. The punishment was the minimum they could have got.

 But the Munnabhai star has his hopes pinned on the probation lifeline.

 Like Dutt (in picture), the Qureshis were guilty of possessing firearms in a notified area under the arms act. But unlike the actor, Ehsan was convicted under the anti-terror law. Ayub was also guilty of aiding a terrorist act.

 Dutt had acquired an AK-56 rifle and a 9-mm pistol from Abu Salem in January 1993, two months before the blasts. The Qureshis bought the weapons after the explosions.

 Dutt might be given the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, because he wasnt convicted under the anti-terror act. This act is meant for first-time or juvenile offenders and cannot be applied to those convicted under the anti-terror act.

 The actor has been summoned to the special court on June 1. 

 Judge Pramod Kode said he was giving the Qureshis minimum punishment because they had procured the weapons after the blasts.

 Another accused, Zamir Qadri, was given life term for helping Tiger Memon with the arms landings.

 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 No sour grapes, just more wine

When deputy chief minister B. S. Yediyurappa uncorks his brand of finance management while presenting the Karnataka state budget next week, one cant complain that it will be old wine in a new bottle. 

 In fact, the wine bottle may move from the smelly confines of liquor stores to brightly-lit department store shelves.

 The aim is to encourage grape growers. Vineyards around Bangalore and Bijapur have been producing good-quality grapes for years. And with stable prices and good returns, the government wants other farmers to switch to grapes. Now, with an amendment, the government hopes provision stores would be able to sell wine.

 Six years ago, a similar move to place beer on department store shelves by then chief minister S.M. Krishna met with opposition from all sides. 

 Krishna had to abandon the move after he failed to convince people that beer was a harmless drink with low alcohol content.

 AIDS stalks tribal troupes

Highways and red-light areas are old AIDS danger zones. Now, a Visakhapatnam tribal belt crawling with HIV positives is giving the Andhra government sleepless nights.

 A recent report of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has set alarm bells ringing on the growing number of patients among the Dhimsa dancers.

 Random tests last month showed that 90 per cent of 10-member troupes women and men between 20 and 30 were positive. 

 According to district officials, tribal girls participating in programmes meant for tourists are among the most vulnerable. Others end up in flesh trade. 

 The Naco report has singled out tourist spots like Tyda, Anantagiri and Araku Valley as the sites where the outbreak is much higher. 

 The Andhra Pradesh AIDS control society is trying to encourage use of condoms, says G. Ashok Kumar, the director of the society.

 Newborn tips the scales

Underweight babies are common, while overweight ones delivered by mothers suffering from diseases, like diabetes, are handled with extra care.

 But doctors at the ESI (Employees Service Insurance) Hospital in Chennais K.K. Nagar early this week were dumbstruck when a healthy mother gave birth to a beautiful girl weighing 5.75 kg. The average birth-weight for a healthy kid is 3 kg.

 Since the mother was too exhausted after such a heavy delivery and was in no position to breast-feed the child, she was put on a glucose drip. 

 The newborn was put through ECG, ultra-sound and thyroid tests.

 She has some company when it comes to tipping the scales, but in faraway China. A 6-kg kid was born there recently.

 Cup cheers

The concept of sports bars may be in its infancy in India, but many bars, pubs restaurants and malls here are gearing up to cash in on the contagious cricket fever. 

 Gurdeep Singh, general manager of Trip With Us, a Vasant Vihar bar, calls the 32-inch flat screen TV he has installed a sure-shot investment. Many usual clients have told us they would love to watch the World Cup with friends over a beer or two, he says.

 Malls arent about to be left behind either. The fan shopping shouldnt miss the action, says Rakesh Luthra, manager of Parsvanath Metro Mall in Pitampura. 

 There is a slight problem, though. The matches will start after 8 pm Indian time, and liquor licences are available only till midnight.

Delhi: An evening on March 12 may be an opportunity to catch Kathak dance virtuoso Shovana Narayan at the Kamani Auditorium where she will perform a Kathak ballet, Mera Safar, based on a poem by the late Ali Sardar Jafri that probes metaphysical questions of life and death.

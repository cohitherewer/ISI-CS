The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Enter, the child warriors of reservation

 - Students to street fighters

 Lathis in hand and stones in their pockets, they prowl the deserted Agra-Jaipur highway. Until two weeks back, they had been lost in books. Now, they are foot soldiers, the walls of defiance.

 Meet the children on the frontlines of Rajasthans battle for domination. They are Meenas and Gujjars, but they are also what they arent supposed to be at this age: street fighters.

 We want to go back but cant do so till the quota issue is settled. Our elders want us to stay at the forefront of the agitation. Pehle hama goli lage gi, phir unko (We will be the first to face the bullets, then it will be the turn of elders), says Krishna, 13, in Theekra, a Meena-dominated village.

 In Sikandara village, where Gujjars are a majority, schoolchildren squat on the road clutching stones to be hurled at window panes of vehicles that refuse to stop. 

 We dont want guns, but education. We want our just demands to be implemented and that is to get jobs, says Ramchander, a 15-year-old leading a band of protesters.

 Asked if they liked what they were doing, the boys said they had no choice. I should have been engrossed in my school books. We dont like what is happening. But we have been told we have to create trouble to ensure our samaj enjoys a better future, says Omprakash, only nine.

 The boys let this correspondents car pass, saying they had orders not to create trouble for the media. Please carry on. Dont worry about the smoke. They are from tyres of buses we had torched earlier, says Seeta, 11, as he signals to others to remove the blocks.

 At Etah village, Banwarilal and Rajhans patrol the highway, but unlike the protesters elsewhere, the Meena boys only want to find out about the condition in the rest of Rajasthan from those passing by. 

 Saab, what is happening? We are told things are bad. We dont have any information. Please help our village. It has Gujjars and Meenas. Both are living in fear, says Banwarilal. 

 Rajhans says he has been waiting in the unbearable heat to hear about what has been happening in the state. The paper wallahs havent been coming since the trouble began last week. Our studies are getting hampered, he complains. Etah village, where most are educated, is the only one in Dausa free of a blockade.

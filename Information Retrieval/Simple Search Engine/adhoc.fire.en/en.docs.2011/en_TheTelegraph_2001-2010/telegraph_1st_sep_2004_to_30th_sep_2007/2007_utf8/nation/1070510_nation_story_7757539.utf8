 Most jobs in informal sector

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 9: Nearly 72 per cent of workers in cities and 82 per cent in villages are engaged in the informal sector.

 The findings have emerged in a study by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO), which suggests the sector, comprising small proprietary and partnership firms, is the largest employer. 

 Thats what we believed all along. Most of these people are self-employed. It means the corporate (organised) sector hasnt been generating too many jobs, said S.P. Gupta, former member of the Planning Commission. 

 The government has been worried that, in spite of reforms, new jobs are not being created in the organised sector.

 The survey covered the non-agricultural sector and a part of agriculture, too, but left out large areas like commercial gardening, horticulture and dairy jobs. Together, these account for 52 per cent of all jobs in the farm sector.

 The findings suggest there is some shift to non-farm jobs in rural areas, analysts say. With agriculture contributing only 18-19 per cent to the GDP (national income), one cant depend on farming alone. With many opportunities in construction, housekeeping and vegetable vending, people are moving to these sectors, said an analyst.

 The non-agricultural sector accounted for 87 per cent of workers and agriculture for the rest. Nearly 98 per cent of the workers were engaged in non-agriculture jobs in urban areas against 79 per cent in villages. 

 Outside agriculture, over 80 per cent of the workers were involved in informal activities in manufacturing.

 A disturbing finding was that 59 per cent of the regular wage employees, in cities and villages, had no job contracts. Nearly 79 per cent of casual workers had no unions.

 In real estate, renting and allied activities, 87 per cent of the rural male workers and 78 per cent of urban male workers were in the informal sector. For women, the figure was 79 per cent in villages and 64 per cent in urban areas. 

 Ninety-one per cent of women in villages had jobs in rural areas. For men, the figure was nearly 75 per cent. The numbers, economists said, show that women are not as willing to relocate to towns in search of work as men. The proportion of workers in cities who found jobs nearby was 90 per cent for men and 93 per cent for women.

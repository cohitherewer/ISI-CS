 Kidnap amp; rape in lovers haunt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 18: A 15-year-old girl sitting with her boyfriend in a favourite but isolated lovers haunt in north-east Mumbai was whisked off from under his nose and allegedly raped last evening.

 Sneha (name changed) and Sandeep Chowdhary, 21, were sitting on steps leading from a bridge across Thane creek when two men hit the youth on his head, hustled his girlfriend into a fishing boat and rowed away into the nearby mangrove forests.

 This morning, Sneha filed a complaint against four men at a police station in Mulund. The Class X student, who just sat her board exams, was reported missing by her boyfriend yesterday.

 Police sources said Sneha and Sandeep, who works with a courier company, had gone to the spot after watching a 3.30 pm movie. The girl has been sent to JJ Hospital for tests.

 In her complaint, Sneha said two more men had joined the kidnapper duo in the boat and raped her between 8.30 pm and 3 am deep inside the mangrove forests. When she woke up this morning, she found the four sleeping. As the boat was anchored, she clambered off and ran to the closest railway station at Vikhroli.

 Sneha then called up a relative and narrated what had happened. She walked into the police station around 4 am and filed her complaint.

 Last evening, Sandeep, who fell unconscious after being whacked with a bamboo stick, rushed to his friends after coming round. Together they contacted a beat constable patrolling the bridge, who relayed a missing person message to Navghar police station.

 After Sneha filed her complaint, a full-fledged investigation has been started.

 Suspicion on adopted kin

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 PC Ram

 Guwahati, July 1: The adopted daughter of slain FCI executive director P.C. Ram was named a suspect as police today scrambled to wrap up an investigation that made little progress when the official was alive in Ulfa captivity.

 Sources said June Murmu, who is in her early twenties, might have introduced Ulfa militants masquerading as contractors to Ram not long before the abduction. 

 A member of the probe team confirmed that June was under the scanner but did not elaborate. As of now, we can only say that we are not ruling out her involvement in the abduction of Ram. At the same time, we do not have any conclusive evidence. 

 June is an Adivasi girl from Baksa district and used to stay with Ram in his rented Guwahati apartment. 

 The investigators are convinced that Ram was held captive in Baksa for the better part of the two-and-a-half months since his abduction from Guwahati.

 Senior police officials are, however, at a loss to explain why search teams could not trace the FCIs senior-most official in the Northeast for such a long period. The operation also involved the CRPF and the army. 

 Ram was abducted on April 17.

 We had information about several of the locations where Ram was kept but his abductors managed to sneak away before we reached these hideouts, deputy inspector-general (central-western range) G.P. Singh said in Nalbari.

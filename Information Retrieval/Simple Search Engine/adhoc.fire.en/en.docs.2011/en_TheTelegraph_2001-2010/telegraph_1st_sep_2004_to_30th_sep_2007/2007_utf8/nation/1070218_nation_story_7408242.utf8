 Jeers amp; cheers for Dhaka emergency

 Mukherjee: On a Saarc trip

 Dhaka, Feb. 17: When Dhakas combative media recently ran reports about army excesses in both Bengali and English soon after emergency was declared in Bangladesh on January 11 newly installed chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmeds advisory council reportedly debated what kind of preventive action should be taken to still the democratic clamour from other, copycat journalists.

 Soon, though, the US and British embassies in Dhaka had issued stern statements in favour of freedom of the press. 

 The new government, sensitive to what the international community would have to say about overt censorship, let the matter go.

 So when Indian foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee comes visiting on Monday to invite President Iajuddin to the Saarc summit in Delhi in April, he will find this robust city on a knife-edge, straddling both truth and speculation.

 On one hand, both journalists and political activists are treading a fine line between caution and irreverence for authority. Many refused to come on record on the matter of the media stories, though all of Dhaka ostensibly knows exactly what happened.

 On the other, even a short walk around the city centre brings you face to face with another incredible truth. The people, among the poorest in the world, with first-hand experience of martial law even in independent Bangladesh, seem to be rooting for the emergency imposed by army chief Lt. Gen. Moyeen U. Ahmed.

 For a start, the army is wielding a determined broom to cleanse public life from the criminalised cesspool of politics, into which Bangladesh had almost been willing itself for the last few years.

 At last count, 19 ministers from the major parties, the BNP and the Awami League, have been arrested on charges of massive corruption. 

 Another 60,000 people have also been detained so far, among them bureaucrats, tax evaders, smaller activists, and it is said even doctors and teachers, all because they were stealing public funds.

 Soldiers are all over Bangladesh these days, inspecting factories and godowns for such evidence. Relief material donated by foreign governments, such as blankets, tin for construction roofs and sheds, medicines and even sports goods have been forcibly removed by these soldiers from homes of the rich and powerful. 

 So far, the people are applauding with both hands. 

 The army performed a minor miracle in January when it dismissed the Khaleda Zia government and took matters in hand, said a salesman in a big Dhaka store.

 For example, when the all-powerful Tariq Zia, son and heir of former Prime Minister Khaleda, was recently put under house arrest because he was ostensibly planning not one but three coups against the army in the short month since his mother was divested from power, even Dhakas intelligentsia was fully on board.

 So far, the clamour against human rights abuses hasnt begun. Major countries like the US, Britain, India, Pakistan and China have largely held their peace because the army has preferred to work behind the scenes.

 There is an emergency in Bangladesh today, but there is no army rule. And at least for the time being, that is worth all the difference.

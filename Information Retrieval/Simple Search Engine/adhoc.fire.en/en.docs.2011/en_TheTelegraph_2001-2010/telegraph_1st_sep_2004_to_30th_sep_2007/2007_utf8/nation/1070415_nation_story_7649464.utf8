 Now, catch Tyson in Bollywood number

 Mumbai, April 14 (PTI): He is remembered for chewing off a piece of Evander Holyfields ear, but boxer Mike Tyson is all set to make a name for himself in a totally different field as a Bollywood item song hero.

 Producer Feroze Nadiadwala has invited Tyson (in picture) to star in a promotional video for his comedy thriller Fool and Final.

 We thought Mike Tyson would be the perfect choice for this promotional video because the film does have an element of boxing in it. Also all the stars of the film, including Sunny Deol, are huge fans of the boxer, said Nisha Chattani, a media consultant for the film.

 Directed by Ahmed Khan, the movie stars Sunny Deol, Shahid Kapur, Ayesha Takia, Viveik Oberoi and Sameera Reddy. Deol plays a boxer in Fool and Final that is scheduled for a June release.

 Ahmed himself will shoot the video and Tyson will fly down to Mumbai in early June to shoot it. The video will primarily be released as a promotional item, but it could be included in the film as well, she said.

 While the details are still being worked out, Chattani said the video would be very unique and will also feature all the stars of the film.

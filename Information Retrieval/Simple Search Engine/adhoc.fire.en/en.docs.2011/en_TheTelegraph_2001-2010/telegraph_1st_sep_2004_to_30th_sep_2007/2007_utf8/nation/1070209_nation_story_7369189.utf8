 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Spy scam: Live another day

 A spicy tale of sex and espionage has Delhi and Chennai agog, but the man at its centre will be relieved to hear the Centre saying live and let live.

 The private secretary to junior home minister S. Raghupathy, repatriated to his parent IPS cadre in Tamil Nadu allegedly over secret trysts with a woman UK mission official, may have fallen into a honey trap, intelligence agencies believe.

 Sources said Shakeel Akhtar, privy to weekly Intelligence Bureau reports and talks with Naga militants, was filmed meeting the suspected MI6 spy at posh Delhi hotels and a government guest house. That he wasnt seen passing any information has saved his bacon.

 Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi has echoed the Union home ministry stand that Akhtar had asked to be shifted but Jayalalithaa claims RAW has information the official passed on secrets. Karunanidhi showed off photographs of Jayalalithaa handing Akhtar, a state police hero, several awards.

 With love, from farmers

 As Valentines in Europe say it with roses on February 14, farmers here would hope they keep doing so.

 Forty million roses would make it to supermarkets in Europe and Japan via Bangalore before this Valentines Day. 

 Around 10 million Red Crests, Red Saints, Red Bests and Red Fashions some of the 130 varieties grown in Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu flew out last week.

 Although aided by the Tamil Nadu agency Tanflora, the tech capitals proximity to Dharmapuri has made the farmers prospects better.

 A young romance can blossom or a failing one sail through a thorny test because of a little red rose. So the packing and the transportation of the flowers have to be done with care that can match the feelings of a Valentine. 

 Not to mention the fragrance, which can make the beloveds Yes all the more easy to obtain.

 Canine catwalk

 Every dog has his day. And if he happens to belong to a wealthy Mumbaikar, he will also have a fashion parade thrown in.

 The citys socialite set headed to the St. Stanislaus School ground in Bandra on February 3 and 4 for the Bombay Presidency Kennel Club Dog Show. 

 As the pooches strutted their stuff, their parents preened with pride.

 For most of them, pets are to be pampered. 

 For my dog, it is these meets and shows that provide fun and frolic. I even take her for dog picnics. She is special, so she deserves special treatment, says one of the owners.

 Not all dogs were competing, though. Some like Bruce, a Great Dane, had come for the experience. 

 When it comes to brilliance, it is the original breed that overtakes the rest. I will not mind my son marrying a girl from another caste, but for Bruce, I always insist on the original breed and will never compromise on that, said his owner.

 Peace flag

 Munnabhai did it with flowers. Now, Bangaloreans are indulging in a bit of Gandhigiri with flags. 

 And the ubiquitous red-and-yellow Kannada flag that Karnataka has adopted is doing the needful keeping marauding mobs at bay. 

 The city has seen violence breaking out at the drop of a hat. First, it was screen icon Rajkumar, who stoked the Kannadigas passion with crowds going on the rampage on the day of his funeral. Then Saddam Husseins hanging almost sparked a communal riot.

 The peace flags can be seen fluttering on autorickshaws, BPO cabs, private cars and buildings. 

 Delhi: If you are in the capital, dont miss the red fragrant roses President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam loves so much. The Mughal Gardens will be open to the public from February 10 to March 18 between 10.30 am and 4.30 pm except on Mondays and on March 3 and 4.

 Lives, not bugs, smoked out

 Many recoiled in shock after learning about at this tragedy last week. An elderly couple and their Chettinad-style house were gutted in a blaze sparked by a mosquito coil.

 The bodies of Chinnapa Chettiyar, 87, and his bed-ridden wife Mutthalaachi, 80, were pulled out of the smouldering structure by fire-fighters in a Sivaganga village.

 The couple had been staying alone in the spacious, high-roof house, supported by teak wood pillars, which the flames licked first as they swallowed the 125-year-old edifice.

 A milkman passing by in the wee hours noticed the inferno and informed the fire brigade in neighbouring Thiruvaadaanai.

 It took the blaze busters five hours to douse the flames but not the haunting images of the house on fire.

 More teeth for drive

 Ever since two kids were mauled to death by stray dogs, the leash is off the hunt for the killer pack. 

 Each morning, canine catchers fan out across the city, hoping to get truckloads of the bite-happy culprits.

 One team from Keralas Malabar region, and another from Ahmedabad, are helping in the drive. The 20 Malabar men blend into the locality and take the strays by surprise.

 The Gujarat gang is more observant it spends hours studying the packs before picking out the ferocious and netting them.

 Each Malabar hunter carries a copper wire, of an arms length, which is deftly strung around the canines neck. Its vice-like grip keeps aggressive customers at bay. 

 The drive has left animal lovers fuming. They accuse unlicensed meat and poultry shops of dumping waste in residential areas and attracting the hungry hordes. Too many watchdogs, did someone say?

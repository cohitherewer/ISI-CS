 IIT lesson to Bengal on land use

 A STAFF REPORTER

 IIT Kharagpur

 Calcutta, June 14: IIT Kharagpur will advise the Bengal government on how best to use the land around the town, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said here today.

 The institute will look at West Midnapore district, especially the area around Kharagpur, and identify the types of land. It will also suggest the uses that these plots can be put to, including the possibilities of industrial and commercial projects, the chief minister said. Bhattacharjee was speaking to his colleagues who are part of the state cabinets core committee.

 Last year, Paschimanchal Unnayan Parishad a regional development board had roped in the IIT to conduct a survey of 74 blocks in five districts. Its report covered crop patterns, irrigation, education and power.

 With several steel companies showing interest in setting up plants in Burdwan and Purulia, the government is trying to improve infrastructure in these areas. The focus is on improving links with Asansol.

 The chief minister is planning a third bridge over the Damodar to connect Asansol with Purulia. This will help Bhushan Steel, which is setting up a plant in Salanpur, near Asansol, PWD minister Kshiti Goswami said.

 The chief minister spoke of the problems some investors are facing. The Jindals, who are setting up a steel plant at Salboni, are grappling with water scarcity. The firm will lay pipelines to bring water from the Rupnarayan river.

 The Emami group is facing the same problem at its paper mill in West Midnapore. Bhattacharjee said the company has decided to bring water from the Subarnarekha.

 Port plan

 The chief minister hoped the Centre would soon clear a deep-sea port in the state. He had pushed for it during his meeting with the Prime Minister earlier this month. 

 Bhattacharjee, however, ruled out the area off the Sagar Island where the port was planned earlier as a site because there is a problem in getting the right depth. The location will be near the Digha or Sankarpur coasts.

 Bhattacharjee asked his ministers to send their views on the proposal for a mega chemical hub drawn up by commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen last month.

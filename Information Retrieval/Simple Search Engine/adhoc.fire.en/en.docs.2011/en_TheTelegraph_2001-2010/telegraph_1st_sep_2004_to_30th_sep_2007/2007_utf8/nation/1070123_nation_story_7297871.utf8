 Change of life by 30 in women

 New Delhi, Jan. 22 (PTI): A study has found that Indian women are now attaining menopause as early as the age of 30.

 The report, compiled by T.S. Syamala and M. Sivakami of the Institute for Social and Economic Change in Bangalore, also pointed out that women living in rural areas are more prone to premature menopause. 

 It is of great concern that women are attaining premature menopause. Some are attaining it as early as 30 years, Syamala said. 

 Early menopause may be a risk factor for earlier mortality from diseases related to decreased oestrogen levels and may promote incidence of osteoporosis, heart diseases, diabetes, hypertension and breast cancer. 

 The report, which was presented in Parliament, said that 3.1 per cent of women in the country are already in menopause by the age of 30-34. This rises to 8 per cent for the age bracket of 35-39. The incidence of menopause is quite rapid after the age of 40-41.

 In urban areas, the proportion of women in premature menopause is lower (16.1 per cent) than in rural areas (18.3 per cent). 

 Syamala said those who marry late need not panic as they have children late, resulting in delayed menopause. She added that the proportion of women who are in menopause decreases considerably with the increase in education.

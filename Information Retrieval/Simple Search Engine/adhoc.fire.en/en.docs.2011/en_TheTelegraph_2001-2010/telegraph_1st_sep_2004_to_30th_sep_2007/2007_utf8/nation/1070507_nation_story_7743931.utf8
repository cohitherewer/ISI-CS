 Arjun eyes VP chair, but madam silent

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, May 6: Arjun Singh isnt averse to becoming Vice-President, he said last week, his interest in the post being seen as a desire to take a break from electoral politics.

 I want to serve the Congress with all my dedication. Whatever work the party will give me, I would like to do it with full sincerity, the Union HRD minister said when asked if he was open to being nominated to the post.

 He might be ready for the job, but it is not known if the party leadership will oblige. Not when the three-time Madhya Pradesh chief minister, governor and AICC vice-president is caught in the quota logjam. 

 Insiders say Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh might also look at Pranab Mukherjee, Sushil Kumar Shinde and Karan Singh as potential candidates.

 Many in Madhya Pradesh, Arjuns home state, believe he is trying to resurrect himself at a time when his stature within the party has diminished. 

 In recent years, Arjun has not been perceived to be close to Sonia. Senior party leaders say he hasnt recovered from the shock of May 18, 2004 when Sonia turned down the Prime Ministers job and named Manmohan.

 Soniajis choice showed Arjun was not even a favourite. It exposed the myth that he was her eyes and ears. Congressmen realised he was not even in the know of things, a former chief minister said. Another defining moment, he added, was Sonias resignation from the Lok Sabha over the office-of-profit controversy. Unlike other party leaders, Arjun wasnt privy to her decision.

 Then came the quota row. The Congress leadership is divided on the ministers attempts to take credit for OBC reservation, whose fate now rests in the hands of the court.

 His detractors in Bhopal say Arjuns carefully cultivated image as a catalyst of change is often aimed at gaining popularity without benefiting the sections he champions.

 In 1981, a year after he became chief minister, Arjun appointed the Ramji Mahajan commission to conduct a survey on OBCs. Based on the findings, which showed that only 2.2 per cent of OBC children made it to Class IX in 1981-82, the panel recommended 35 per cent reservation in educational institutions run or aided by the government. It also proposed that 35 per cent of government, semi-government and public sector jobs be reserved for OBCs.

 Arjun enforced the proposals, but the decision was stayed by Indore High Court within months. Successive Congress regimes in the 1980s did little to get the stay lifted Arjun himself was at the helm thrice during this period.

 Thirteen years later, in 1994, the proposals were put into effect, partially, when Digvijay Singh was chief minister. He announced a 14 per cent reservation and managed to get around court. 

 Described by many as the politician among politicians, Arjun will now have to wait for Sonia to hand him the Vice-Presidents post or to keep him where he is.

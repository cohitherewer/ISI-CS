 Moral froth at pub in tech city

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, May 6: Culture cops of Bangalore have shifted focus from language to lager.

 Athena, the basement pub at Leela Palace Hotel, was shut down last night by vigilantes for promoting un-Indian culture. 

 A fringe group called the Karnataka Yuva Vedike, which had been fighting for the primacy of Kannadiga, had forced another city hangout, Club Cabana, to down shutters a week before. 

 Bipin Chandra, who was at Athena when the moral brigade barged in, said some employees and customers tried to resist the 80-strong mob but they were outnumbered. Pub culture is not our culture. Get out and stay out, declared the intruders.

 While some of the activists guarded the entry to the pub, others ensured that those inside were pushed out. The red-and-yellow Karnataka flag was unfurled amid slogan-raising by the group.

 Although police soon arrived and the activists were arrested, the damage had already been done. In the commotion, liquor bottles, glasses and furniture were broken.

 Manoj Kumar, regional manager of Indage Hotels that runs Athena, said the activists came in a truck and entered the pub at 11.15 pm.

 They just walked in and forced us to shut down. We have not done anything illegal. We have a licence to run the place till midnight. As customer safety is a priority, we told our patrons to leave the premises. The pub is open today, Kumar said.

 Pub-owners in the city are worried that such incidents might hurt efforts to get the closing hour extended beyond 11.30 pm. 

 The state tourism department had recently written to the government to redraft excise rules to allow pubs and restaurants to serve liquor for at least an hour more. The deadline for premier hotels is 12 midnight, while restaurants have to close at 11 pm.

 Tourism department sources said they were determined to ring in the changes. Bangalore is an international city. We cannot close down this early, a source said.

 Salmans turn at sleepless night

 Salman: Keeping aloof

 Mumbai, Aug. 23: Sanjay Dutt is out on a breather but buddy Salman Khan is holding his breath.

 Salman today flew to Jodhpur to face the verdict of a court tomorrow on his appeal against a conviction in a poaching case.

 A lower court had in April 2006 sentenced Salman to five years in jail for killing a chinkara in September 1998. The actor then had to spend three days in jail before bail was given. The chinkara, a protected species under the Wildlife Act, is sacred to the local Bishnoi community.

 If the sessions court upholds the lower courts order, Salman may have to spend at least seven days in jail, lawyers said.

 Salmans lawyers will have to approach the high court with a revision petition. But till the judgment is made available, the high court will not be able to take the case up an issue that has prompted the Supreme Court to grant bail to Sanjay.

 We certainly will use the precedent of the Supreme Court granting Sanjay Dutt bail without the operational order. But even that may mean at least a weeks stay in jail, said Hastimal Saraswat, the actors lawyer.

 But the lawyer expressed hope that such a situation would not arise and Salman would walk free. 

 Salman, who headed for Jodhpur accompanied by brother Sohail and some friends, was said to have been unusually quiet over the past week, which has not been a good one for him. 

 He had set high hopes on Marigold, but the cold box-office response and the anxiety over the court case had started telling on him. He has been aloof. He is difficult when he sulks, but those who love him understand his mood swings and are standing by him, a friend of the family said. 

 Salman does have a lot to worry about. The Rajasthan government is pushing for an exemplary sentence to keep out other celeb hunters and pacify the powerful Bishnois but the actors lawyers are falling back on a forensic report that claims that the animal killed was not a chinkara.

 We have said that the forensic report of the animal does not prove it to be a chinkara. Moreover, if four people can be freed by the court on lack of evidence, how can Salman alone be found guilty? Saraswat asked. 

 But Mahipal Bishnoi, the advocate for the Bishnois, said the argument would not wash.

 They are doubting the forensic science lab report. Their argument is that the report does not say clearly whether the blood found at the place of killing is the same as the blood and remains of the chinkara found at the Ghoda farmhouse. I am sure the court will reject it, he said.

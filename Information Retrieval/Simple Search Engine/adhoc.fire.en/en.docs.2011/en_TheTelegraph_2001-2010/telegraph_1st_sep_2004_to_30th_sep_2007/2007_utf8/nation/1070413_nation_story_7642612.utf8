 Territory test for butterfly Ajit 

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 The UP Poll Boiler 

 Lucknow, April 12: Ajit 

 Singh faces the tough job of holding on to his Jat support 

 base when western Uttar Pradesh votes tomorrow.

 The Jats can make the difference 

 in at least 40 of the 58 seats that will be up for grabs 

 in the second phase of the Assembly polls. Ajit had inherited 

 this caste vote bank from his father, former Prime Minister 

 Chaudhary Charan Singh, but his string of opportunistic 

 alliances over the years has turned away many supporters.

 One of Ajits biggest worries 

 will be the array of Jat candidates, including some of his 

 former loyalists, fielded by his rivals. While this makes 

 a division of Jat votes likely, another threat is the new 

 consolidation of Dalit votes, such as the Jatavs, 

 by Mayavati. The Bahujan Samaj Party won 16 seats from the 

 region in the 2002 Assembly polls, while Ajit and his then 

 ally BJP bagged 11 each.

 This time, Ajits Rashtriya 

 Lok Dal is going it alone after alliance talks broke down 

 with the Congress, its 1999 Lok Sabha poll partner to which 

 Charan Singh was vehemently opposed. In the 2004 parliamentary 

 elections, Ajit had tied up with the ruling Samajwadi Party. 

 Its this habit of jumping 

 from one boat to another that has prompted many of his loyalists 

 to leave him. The RLD will be fighting some of them tomorrow.

 For instance, in the Jat heartland 

 of Chaprauli in Baghpat, associated with Charan Singh the 

 way Rae Bareli or Amethi are linked to the Gandhis, Ajits 

 candidate Ajay Tomar is pitted against the BSPs Gajendra 

 Munna, who was RLDs MLA in 1996.

 The BJP and Samajwadi Party, too, 

 have fielded Jat candidates from the constituency.

 In Barnawa, Samarpal Singh, twice 

 elected on RLD tickets, is the Samajwadi candidate while 

 his closest rival Satyendra Solanki, who has always been 

 opposed to the RLD, is Ajits candidate. The BSP, too, 

 has fielded a former Ajit loyalist. Such switches of personnel 

 and loyalties have taken the sheen off Ajits key planks, 

 such as a support price for sugarcane farmers and the demand 

 for a Harit Pradesh state.

 Maya math

 Mayavatis trump cards come 

 from opposite ends of the caste spectrum. She had successfully 

 organised the Dalits especially the extremely backward 

 Jatavs before the previous polls. This time, she is also 

 wooing the upper castes and has liberally distributed tickets 

 among Brahmins, Thakurs and Kayasthas.

 With the BSP chief having scaled 

 down her tirade against the upper castes, she is expected 

 to gain a slice of the Brahmin votes. 

 Mulayam stakes 

 The Samajwadi Partys vaunted 

 Muslim-Yadav axis could be dented by the emergence of the 

 United Democratic Front, formed by the imam of the Delhi 

 Jama Masjid, Ahmad Bukhari. Haji Yaqoob Quereshi, who used 

 to be in Mulayams ministry, is contesting on a UDF 

 ticket, threatening to split Muslim votes in Meerut.

 Mulayam, however, is trying to 

 convince Jat voters that he is the true political heir to 

 Charan Singh, a line that should worry Ajit.

 Kalyan card

 The BJP is eyeing a vote bank 

 that overlaps with Mayavatis Brahmins, Thakurs and 

 non-Jatav Dalits. What the Jatavs have done for the BSP 

 the BJP hopes the Lodhs will do for it.

 The Lodhs, like Jatavs, are one 

 of the most backward castes even among the Dalits. Former 

 chief minister Kalyan Singh is from this caste and his son 

 is contesting from Debai, a constituency that has returned 

 Lodh candidates almost every time since 1957.

 Tikait ticket

 The Congress will be hoping that 

 the alliance with Bahujan Kisan Dal, the political wing 

 of Mahendra Singh Tikaits Bharatiya Kisan Dal, brings 

 in a few seats.

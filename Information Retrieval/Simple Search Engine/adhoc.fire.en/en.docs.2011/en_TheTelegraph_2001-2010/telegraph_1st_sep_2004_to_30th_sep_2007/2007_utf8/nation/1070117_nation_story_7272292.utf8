 Hindus in Europe fight for swastika 

 London (Reuters): Hindus in Europe are joining forces to oppose German calls for a law across the European Union banning the display of Nazi symbols, saying the swastika symbolises peace and not hate.

 Hindus in Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Italy plan to visit each EU member state, European Commission leaders and members of the European Parliament to garner support for a pressure group.

 Germany plans to use its presidency of the EU to launch an initiative which could lead to common laws across the bloc making it a crime to deny genocide and display Nazi symbols.

 The swastika has been around for 5,000 years as a symbol of peace. This is exactly the opposite of how it was used by Hitler, said Ramesh Kallidai of the Hindu Forum of Britain.

 It is almost like saying that the Klu Klux Klan used burning crosses to terrorise black men, so therefore let us ban the cross. How does that sound to you? 

 Slap stick for Gujarat judge

 Ahmedabad: Senior Gujarat High Court judge B.J. Sethana who had slapped his colleague has been transferred to Sikkim. 

 The decision was taken on the last working day of former Supreme Court Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal. 

 The Supreme Court collegium recommended Sethanas transfer to Sikkim, considered to be an insignificant and punishment posting. 

 Last Thursday, Sethana had invited his colleague Justice Pradeep Majmudar and his wife for a cup of tea. After a heated debate over some old issue, Sethana reportedly slapped Majmudar. 

 School torture

 Chennai: The Tamil Nadu government has banned corporal punishment in schools across the state. 

 The order came following complaints of physical torture in schools. A girl recently killed herself on the school premises after her teachers had allegedly pulled her up for bad performance. 

 Maoist ceasefire

 Hyderabad: Maoists in Andhra Pradesh have announced a ceasefire that could last six months to a year. The decision comes following reverses, capture of key cadres and the death of rebel top guns in encounters over the last two years. 

 Damages for call 

 New Delhi (PTI): Mobile users who feel harassed by unsolicited calls and SMSes from their service providers, banks or telemarketers are entitled to a minimum compensation of Rs 25,000, the Delhi consumer commission has ruled. 

Goa will celebrate its traditional carnival from February 17. Around 30,000 tourists are expected during the four-day-long extravaganza. Special carnival parades will also be held.

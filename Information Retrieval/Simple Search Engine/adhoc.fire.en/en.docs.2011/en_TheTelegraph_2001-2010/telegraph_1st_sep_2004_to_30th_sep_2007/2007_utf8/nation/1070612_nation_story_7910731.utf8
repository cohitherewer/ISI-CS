 Dinner with hint of deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mayavati, Sonia

 New Delhi, June 11: Mayavati hosted a dinner for Sonia Gandhi and the Prime Minister at her home tonight, with the scent of a deal on the presidential race hanging in the air.

 Sources said the Bahujan Samaj Party leader agreed to back the United Progressive Alliance nominee and endorsed the candidature of Union home minister Shivraj Patil, believed to be the Congress chiefs choice.

 Mayavati herself dropped a broad hint after the meeting when asked about possible differences between her and the Congress leaders.

 Had there been differences, would it have been possible to have the meeting for two hours? the Uttar Pradesh chief minister told reporters after seeing her guests off. The talks took place in a very good atmosphere, she said.

 The Left parties will meet in Delhi tomorrow to work out their response. Some Left leaders are believed to have doubts about Patils winnability.

 Sonia, who returned from the Netherlands today, met Manmohan Singh and senior party leaders A.K. Antony and Ahmed Patel. She and the Prime Minister were together at Lalu Prasads residence, too, where they greeted the railway minister on his 60th birthday. Antony and Ahmed are part of a team, headed by Pranab Mukherjee, that is negotiating with other parties to garner support for Patil.

 Patils chances received another boost with NCP chief Sharad Pawar stressing that his party would not oppose the Union home ministers nomination.

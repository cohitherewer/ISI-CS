 Chennai, July 4: The 15-year-old boy who had allegedly been allowed by his doctor parents to perform a Caesarean section surrendered before the juvenile justice board in Tiruchirappalli today and was granted bail.

 Dileepan Raj, whose parents were denied bail by a sessions court yesterday, has been asked to stay with his maternal grandmother in Manapparai, 40km from Tiruchirappalli.

 An attempt to enter the Guinness World Records, the Caesarean section was allegedly conducted on March 25 on an unidentified woman at Mathi Surgical and Maternity Nursing Home in Manapparai, which is run by Dileepans parents K. Murugesan, a surgeon, and Gandhimathi, a gynaecologist.

 Murugesan and Gandhimathi were arrested on June 25 following an inquiry by the divisional revenue officer. Tiruchirappalli district collector Ashish Vachhani had ordered the probe.

 Dileepan, a higher secondary school student, went into hiding after that. He later moved the Madurai bench of Madras High Court for anticipatory bail. 

 But the court directed him to approach the juvenile board as he is a minor.

 Dileepan was accompanied by two of his lawyers when he turned himself in before the juvenile justice board. 

 As he was entering the boards premises, Dileepan tried to cover his face with a cap, but some photographers knocked it off. 

 The boy then shielded his face with his hands and put on the cap again. But the photographers pushed it off. 

 The chairperson of the juvenile board, D. Sujata, initially remanded Dileepan in custody in a juvenile home till July 18. Only when his lawyers produced a probation certificate did she grant bail to the teenager. Sujata then directed him to stay with his grandmother and be present before the juvenile board as and when required.

 Murugesan and his wife are the main accused in the case. Tamil Nadu police later included Dileepan. 

 On May 6, Murugesan had shown a CD of his sons surgical feat to local doctors at a meeting of the Indian Medical Associations Manapparai branch.

 Outraged, the doctors wrote a secret letter to the IMA, seeking action against Murugesan. But the scam broke last month when the letter was leaked to a Tamil magazine.

 Murugesan had later boasted about his sons achievement in a telephonic interview to the magazine. It is now part of the evidence against him and his wife, who were arrested under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 308 (culpable homicide), and for gross violation of professional ethics under the Indian Medical Council Act. 

 The CD is still missing.

 Murugesan now claims that he had performed the surgery while his son watched.

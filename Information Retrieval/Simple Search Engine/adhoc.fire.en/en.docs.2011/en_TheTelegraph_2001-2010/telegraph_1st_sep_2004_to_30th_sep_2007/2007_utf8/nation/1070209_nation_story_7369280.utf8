 Advani dewy on Pak again

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: Memories of the uncharacteristic speech in Pakistan that has cost him so much seem to have spurred L.K. Advani to further uncharacteristic acts.

 Advani (in picture), whose praise of Mohammad Ali Jinnah during his May-June 2005 cross-border trip forced him out of the party chiefs chair, has dashed off sweet letters to President Pervez Musharraf and former Pakistan Prime Minister Shujaat Hussain.

 He has thanked Musharraf for the Rs 2-crore renovation of the Shiva temple complex in Katas Raj near Lahore, and invited Hussain to visit sufi mystic Khwaja Moinuddin Chishtis dargah (mausoleum) in Ajmer and Delhis Akshardham temple.

 The letters revive memories not only of Advanis controversial Pakistan visit but also his alleged role in spoiling Musharrafs chance to visit Ajmer Sharif in July 2001.

 In an interview to a magazine last year, Musharraf said he had planned to visit the dargah during the Agra Summit but could not because India refused to sign a joint declaration and the talks collapsed.

 Advani is widely held responsible for the summits failure, so he could be indirectly blamed for scuttling Musharrafs dargah trip. But to Hussain, he writes: It would be my pleasure to invite you to visit India at your earliest convenience so that we can together visit Ajmer Sharif and Akshardham.

 To Musharraf, he expresses his deep appreciation for the trouble his government had taken to renovate the 2,300-year-old temple complex in Katas Raj. Advani, at his invitation, had flagged off the renovation just a couple of days after his Jinnah remark.

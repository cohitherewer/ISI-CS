 Priya taps fond family friend

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Priya: Support at last

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: Congress MP Priya Dutt today met an old friend of the family, Sonia Gandhi, to discuss her brother Sanjay Dutt who has been jailed in the 1993 Bombay blasts case.

 Congress sources said the half-hour meeting at 10 Janpath was a morale-booster for the Dutt family, which has been cold-shouldered by the partys Maharashtra leaders.

 Although the Congress has not yet taken an official stand on Sanjay in public notwithstanding minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshis statements of support for the actor the sources said Priya was told the family would get every possible legal assistance.

 Sonia is believed to be very fond of the late Sunil Dutt and his children.

 It was this association that helped Dutt saab weather the bad times when Sanjay was in trouble and (Sharad) Pawar was making things worse for him. He knew Soniaji was on his side, a party leader said.

 The sources said Sonia did not see Sanjay as just another criminal.

 When Manu Sharma, son of Congress minister Vinod Sharma, was about to be convicted in the Jessica Lal murder case, the Haryana leaders desperate efforts to get an audience with Sonia had come to nothing.

 Instead, the Congress president had written to home minister Shivraj Patil urging legislation to prevent witnesses from turning hostile, as had happened in the Jessica case.

 Sonia had earlier betrayed her soft corner for the Dutts by fielding Priya from Mumbai North when the constituency fell vacant after Sunils death, the sources said.

 The Congress president had then asked Sanjay Nirupam, a known enemy of Sunil, not to make things difficult for the daughter.

 Priya was the lone young MP, apart from Rahul Gandhi, who was asked to speak at the Congresss Hyderabad plenary in January 2006. Although her speech was rather lacklustre, Sonia had listened intently.

 After todays meeting, Priya drove to Claridges for lunch before apparently returning home to Pandara Park. Her staff told the waiting journalists the MP was out with friends. Both her cars were parked inside, though.

 Later, the staff said the MP had been advised by her lawyers that speaking to the media could jeopardise her brothers case.

 Priya had arrived in Delhi yesterday and met science and technology minister Kapil Sibal, who had been Sanjays lawyer when he was put in jail the first time. Sibal was then in the Opposition.

 Party sources insisted it was a meeting between a daughter and a close friend of her father, and that Priya didnt come to seek legal advice.

 Sunil Dutt is believed to have been a fine cook and Sibal had earlier spoken highly of the delicious meat curries he used to serve at his farmhouse in the winter months.

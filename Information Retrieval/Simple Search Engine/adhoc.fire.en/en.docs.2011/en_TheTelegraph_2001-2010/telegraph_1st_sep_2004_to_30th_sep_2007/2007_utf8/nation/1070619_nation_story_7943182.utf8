 Plan for 7000 village courts 

 Srinagar, June 18: Seven thousand courts will be set up in villages all over the country in the next few years to ensure that justice reaches the poor, Supreme Court Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said today.

 Our judicial system is very good, but I confess that many benefits are trapped by the rich, he said at a campaign to spread legal awareness in Jammu and Kashmir. 

 Balakrishnan said a bill was being drafted to set up such courts, which would be headed by a judicial officer of the rank of a junior judge. The Centre and states will bear the cost equally.

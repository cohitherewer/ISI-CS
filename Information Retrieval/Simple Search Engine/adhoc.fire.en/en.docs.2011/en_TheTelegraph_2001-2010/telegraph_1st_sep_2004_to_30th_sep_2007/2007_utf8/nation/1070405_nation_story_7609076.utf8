 Common calendar for varsities

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 4: All universities under the UGC will soon have a common academic calendar.

 First-year classes for all courses other than professional ones will have to begin by the first week of August. For second-year students, the classes cannot start later than the third week of July. The universities will have to declare all results by the last week of June. 

 There will be a flexibility of two weeks in beginning professional courses for second-year students. The schedule can be made more flexible, keeping in mind the requirements of project work and summer school internships in professional courses.

 Universities at present have different academic schedules. 

 The new calendar will apply to all universities established or incorporated under a central act, a provincial act or a state/Union territory act, and also to all institutions recognised by or affiliated to such varsities.

 The decision on a common academic calendar was taken by an expert committee. The new schedule will come into effect after it is published in an official gazette.

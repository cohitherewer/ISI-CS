 174509: the mark of armys failure

 Dinjan (Assam) Jan. 11: The gun with a bipod is displayed today inside the nerve centre of army operations in Upper Assam here, the headquarters of the 2 Mountain Division. 

 It isnt smoking any more since it was last fired on the night of January 5 exactly a week back but piecing together the story of the gun offers an insight into what the current drive against the United Liberation Front of Asom is about.

 It is a Universal Machine Gun, presumably manufactured in China, though there are no markings on it that give away its origins just a number etched on its breech 174509. 

 The butt is wooden and a round box magazine feeds belted AK56 bullets that are suspected to have been fired by Ulfa militants on a group of Bihari workers that night at Govindpur.

 A phone call to the 2 divisions operations room minutes after the killing rang alarm bells. Lt Colonel Shikhar of the 6 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles (Jakrif) was despatched with a patrol of 30 soldiers. They drove 60 km down the Dhola road in Tinsukia district that leads into Arunachal Pradesh.

 We dismounted as we approached a landmark and switched off the headlights, a subedar in the officers patrol recalls. Then we walked in separate lines through the fields. The night was dark but we did not want the alert to be sounded, so we made slow progress.

 After midnight, the patrol now in teams of three approached Telok Tea Garden. Their informant had mentioned that at least two, probably three, of the killers had fled in that direction. 

 Sometimes, they have a getaway vehicle, usually a motorcycle, says Major Aman Sharma, also of the 6 Jakrif. The men were asked to lie down and take position, one soldier at the mouth of every row of tea bushes. 

 We have been doing this in Assam for a long time, says the major. Tea gardens look very dense but if you lie down, you have a clear field of vision between the rows of bushes.

 He did not explain how they could see through the dark. Somebody must have carried a night vision device. The eyes have to get used to the dark. 

 One Johnny thought he heard the sound of something dropping into water ahead of us, he continued. 

 The patrol focused there. Sure enough, there were two youths wading through the edge of a pond. A UMG is very heavy and, with a box magazine with some 100 rounds, it makes for slow progress, says Sharma. They were probably trying to throw the gun into the pond or conceal it somehow. 

 Fire! the order went out. But it was too late: the killers vanished into the night. When the patrol ran ahead, they found the UMG 174509. 

 In addition to its box magazine, they found another that is used for shoulder-firing, a set of batteries rigged up to charge mobile phones and iron pellets.

 The 6 Jakrif now displays the arsenal among several such hauls by army units of the 181 brigade commanded by Brigadier Binoy Poonnan. Much of the warlike stores are reminders of similar and often bloody encounters since the suspension of operations was called off on September 25 last year. 

 A few instances: Operation Steel Fist (December 30 and 31) in which two were killed, anti-malaria medicines, 500 gm of RDX and a pistol were found; Op (short for operation) Navratra near Rathnipathar, the night the army resumed its drive after the ceasefire broke down yielded an Austrian hand grenade, another Chinese pistol; and Op Dhullijan in which three were killed and the haul included a DVD player.

 Our strike rate rate of success in nabbing/killing Ulfa cadre has gone up by 48 per cent since operations began, says army chief General Joginder Jaswant Singh.

 But despite the high kill ratio, Operation Rhino II the name for the counter-insurgency drive in Assam since 1997 is one of the longest ongoing military offensives by the Indian Army with no end in sight. 

 The capture of the UMG explains why. First, the army is dependent on intelligence real-time information that it can act upon. Had the patrol reached Govindpur in time, the killings could have been prevented; if it was not able to reach the village in time but had been a little faster, the killers might have been caught. 

 UMG 174509 signifies a failure it is not a success story. In other words, counter-insurgency has reduced the army into a police force.

 Second, and this follows from the first, the army cannot work on its strengths. If Ulfa was an outfit wanting to take on the might of the army conventionally, the 2 Mountain Division would be far superior. It has more sophisticated weaponry, more troops who are better trained and helicopters. 

 But all of that counts for just so much in the dark of an Upper Assam night. A helicopters belly can be ripped apart by a desperate youth on the ground firing from a weapon such as the UMG174509.

 The army fights back, mounting operation after operation. The migrant worker can only flee.

 Stage set for early fission in House

 Sibal: Opening stand

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: The nuclear deal will be debated in Parliament tomorrow and the day after, if the NDA permits.

 The decision to advance the discussion earlier scheduled on September 10 and 11 was taken by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee.

 The Rajya Sabha will have the debate first, tomorrow. The Lok Sabha will follow on Friday. Speculation that Parliament would be adjourned sine die next week ahead of the scheduled date of September 14 followed the decision, but parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi denied this.

 He said the debate was brought forward to take the edge from the Oppositions campaign that the government did not want a discussion, as that would expose the Left-UPA contradictions.

 Outside Parliament, the Congress geared up to take the Left head-on, starting in Bengal.

 On the Prime Ministers directive, Kapil Sibal will address the media in Calcutta on Saturday and then in other metros. The science and technology minister is part of the UPA-Left committee to discuss the nuclear deal. 

 The Congresss independent input is that the urban elite and the middle class, sold on the great American dream, are unhappy with the Left for opposing the deal. The party is working to consolidate its support among these sections. 

 We want to keep the nuclear deal alive in their minds so that if the Left suddenly brings down the government, we can expose them, said a Congress leader.

 The BJP, stung by feedback that its persistent disruptions of Parliament have not gone down well with the thinking class, is veering around to the view that it should not block a debate. Party sources said they would allow the House to function normally something that has not happened this session. 

 For the record, Rajya Sabha MP Sushma Swaraj said the BJP-led NDA would take a call at its meeting tomorrow morning. However, it is learnt that party leaders have informally assured the government that they will not disrupt proceedings.

 Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie, the two MPs who have consistently attacked the deal, will be fielded to speak on it.

 Sibal is expected to be the opening speaker for the ruling coalition. Others lined up include Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Rashid Alvi and Satyavrat Chaturvedi. 

 The UPA-Left panel on the nuclear deal is likely to have its first meeting between September 9 and 13. The Lefts anti-US protests the alliance is running a campaign against the deal and the participation of American naval forces in military exercises with India should conclude on September 8. The CPM and the CPI have raised the pitch against the government and the Prime Minister.

 Mukherjee, who is also the panels convener, will leave for Thailand and South Korea on September 14 and then travel to the US for the UN General Assembly. Asked if the committee will be time-bound, he said: There is no time frame but we will have to work as expeditiously as we can. 

 A question on whether negotiations with nuclear watchdog IAEA and the Nuclear Suppliers Group would be put on hold in the meantime a Left demand drew a sharp retort. Where have you got hold of the words on hold? If you have invented them, you have to explain.

 Kalam for N-power

 In Mumbai, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam subtly underlined the importance of nuclear power in Indias move towards energy security by 2020 and energy independence by 2030.

 On a day the BJP disrupted Parliament on the deal and the Left kept up its tirade, the former President said India needs to dramatically scale up its nuclear power targets.

 Energy is important for development, he said at the launch of the golden jubilee celebrations of Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.

 India generates 4,500MW of nuclear power now, and has a target of reaching 7,400MW by 2010. It has set a target of 24,000MW by 2020. We need to plan for 50,000MW by 2030.

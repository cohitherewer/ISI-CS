 Bengal CPM draws line on cricket

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 16: By turning down Subhas Chakrabortys proposal to contest the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) election, the CPM today made it clear again that no leader or minister can take such decisions without the partys approval.

 Our party operates on the basis of collective leadership and no individual can take decisions that involve the partys policy, state CPM secretary Biman Bose said. 

 The CPMs refusal to allow Chakraborty to contest the CAB poll apparently reflects the partys decision to distance itself from cricket politics. 

 During the earlier CAB election (the contest between Jagmohan Dalmiya and Calcutta police chief Prasun Mukherjee) we said that the party had no role in it and we iterate the position this time too. The party is least concerned about CAB, Bose said.

 On that occasion, the chief minister had publicly supported Mukherjee and described Dalmiyas re-election as a victory of evil force. Then, even though Chakraborty acted as a mediator he did not conceal his support to Dalmiya. 

 This time, however, the situation has changed substantially. Not only is Dalmiya not a candidate, he has also been expelled from BCCI. Also, the chief minister does not seem to be directly involved in the election, though Mukherjee is still widely perceived as Bhattacharjees candidate. 

 On the other hand, Chakraborty continued to fire salvos against Mukherjee for failure as the citys top cop as well as his ambition to occupy the hot seat in CAB. Since Chakraborty claimed to have taken the decision to contest in consultation with senior leaders such as former chief minister Jyoti Basu and Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, it appeared to have a factional overtone. Boses remarks suggested that the party would not allow any leader to force his personal agenda on it. 

 However, if his comments are interpreted as a public snub to Chakrabortys maverick way of functioning, Boses constant advice to the police to be more pro-active can also be construed as a tacit endorsement of Chakrabortys complaints against the police commissioner. 

 Bose declined to comment on Mukherjees candidature for the CAB presidents post, but provided a window on his views. He said that had the city police been more pro- active, they would have been able to gather prior intelligence about sudden and sporadic incidents of violence like the Trinamul Congress attack on the WBIDC office to protest land acquisition.

 The CPM state secretarys stress on the top cops responsibilities in maintaining law and order may touch a chord among the sports ministers supporters, but it is almost certain that the party would not mount any pressure on him to step aside and let Chakraborty get away with his agenda.

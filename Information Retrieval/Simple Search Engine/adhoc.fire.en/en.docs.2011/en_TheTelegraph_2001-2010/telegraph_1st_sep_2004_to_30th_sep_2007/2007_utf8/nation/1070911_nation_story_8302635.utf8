 Mob blinds bike-jackers

 Nawada (Bihar), Sept. 10 (PTI): A mob today gouged out the eyes of three youths who snatched a motorcycle in a chilling reminder of the Bhagalpur blindings. 

 The three, aged around 18 years, were caught by the mob near Shritala, about 40km from here, after they seized the motorcycle at gunpoint from one Saket Kumar.

 Saket offered no resistance to the pistol-toting threesome but used his mobile phone to inform a relative whose village fell on the way the thieves took.

 A mob was waiting for the three and they were dragged off the stolen motorcycle as soon as they appeared, punched and kicked before their eyes were pierced and gouged out with a sharp tool, Shritala police station officer in-charge Manoj Kumar said.

 A police team managed to rescue the youths before the mob could lynch them.

 Manoj said an officer of Buniyadganj police station in the neighbouring Gaya district confirmed that the three, identified as Pintu Singh, Guddu Singh and Rakesh Singh, had criminal antecedents.

 The three were rushed to Nawada Sadar Hospital, from where they were referred to Patna Medical College and Hospital. 

 A case against unidentified persons has been lodged for the blindings.

 Manoj said though Saket who was robbed of his motorcycle had said the three had guns, none was found on them as the mob took them away.

 He said while one of the snatchers, Pintu, was a Class IX student of DAV School in Buniyadganj, Guddu was from Gaya and Rakesh from Fatehpur, also in the same district.

 Eyes of scores of undertrials were gouged out and acid poured on them in Bhagalpur district by the police in the early 1980s.

 Todays incident came close on the heels of a policeman tying an alleged thief to a motorbike and dragging him for some distance in Bhagalpur.

 Suicide for English

 M.R. VENKATESH 

 Chennai, March 28: There were many reasons why Satheeshwaran should not have eaten the poison seeds.

 Life had been good to the strapping youth of 19 from Coimbatore. He was a budding engineer and stood a step away from achieving the glory he craved: Guinness World Records endorsement for a strength feat the Limca Book had already certified.

 Yet one shadow had kept crossing his visions of a future life of glamour he couldnt speak English well enough.

 He was depressed that he could not give media interviews in English, a police officer said about the boy who killed himself on his uncles farm last Monday.

 Speaking over the phone, Satheeshwarans uncle drew the picture of an ambitious young man for whom fame wasnt coming fast enough.

 He was impatient at the delay in getting the Guinness endorsement. And his poor spoken-English skills had given him an inferiority complex, Krishnamurthy said from Elur village, 88 km from Coimbatore.

 Satheeshwaran, an enthusiastic bodybuilder and powerlifter, had made it to the Limca Book of Records last year by doing 153 backhand push-ups in a minute 20 more than the world record police and the youths family said today.

 The second-year student of electronics and communication engineering in Suguna Polytechnic had been displaying his prowess at public functions in Coimbatore.

 But he needed money for the video footages he needed to shoot in line with Guinness specifications, and it was difficult getting sponsors.

 He had asked a state minister to arrange a show before chief minister M. Karunanidhi in Chennai, Krishnamurthy said. 

 Efforts were also under way to organise shows in Delhi before a national audience.

 The minister had promised help, but these things take time in government, Krishnamurthy said. Satheeshwaran didnt have the patience.

 He had seemed all right when, a few days ago, he had gone to his uncles village. He was enjoying himself after a hearty chicken-sambar meal on Sunday and we had given him enough money for the return journey to Coimbatore the next day.

 But Satheeshwaran suddenly decided to visit my brothers farm on Monday afternoon. He was all alone when, in what must have been a sudden bout of depression, he crushed the oleander seeds and swallowed them.

 The boy, however, managed to stagger back home. He was throwing up and admitted what he had done.

 Jammu, July 15: The Line of Control should turn into a Line of Peace and Kashmir into a zone of cooperation, not conflict, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said today.

 Borders cant be changed, but they can be made irrelevant. There can be no question of divisions or partitions, but the Line of Control can become a Line of Peace with a freer flow of ideas, goods, services and people, Singh said at Jammu University where he was conferred an honorary Doctor of Letters.

 Land and water resources could be tapped for the benefit of people from both sides of Kashmir, he said, turning the state from a region of conflict to one of conciliation. 

 Our dialogue with Pakistan seeks to end the bitter legacy of the past 60 years and begin a new chapter in bilateral relations. I hope and believe that Jammu and Kashmir can become a symbol of India-Pakistan cooperation rather than conflict, he said. 

 While there are huge opportunities for the two countries to work together, Singh said these could only be harnessed if terrorism and violence ended permanently.

 Real political power in a democracy comes from the ballot box, and not the barrel of a gun. We are firm in our resolve to fight terrorism and to end the blackmail of terror in this peace-loving state.

 The optimism about a New Kashmir came with a call to separatist leaders, including those of the Hurriyat Conference, to take part in talks with the Centre. These leaders have stayed away from the three round table conferences held since last year.

 I hope they recognise the historic significance and the transparent sincerity of the process and join the talks in future, he said. 

 A panel on the states relations with the Centre, set up during these conclaves, will present its report soon. I hope this report will also address the issue of effective devolution of powers among different regions in the state.

 Singh stressed it was important for any power-sharing scheme to meet the aspirations of people in the states three regions Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. 

 I believe it is possible to pursue the development of Jammu and Kashmir while respecting the legitimate aspirations of the people of each of the three regions, the Prime Minister added.

 Later, laying the foundation of a colony for Kashmiri Pandits who fled the Valley, Singh said he shared the pain of the migrants. The enclave on the outskirts of Jammu will give the Pandits a long-awaited housing solution.

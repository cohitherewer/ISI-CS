 Havan heat on Sidhu

 New Delhi, Feb. 12 (PTI): BJP candidate Navjot Singh Sidhu, who seeks re-entry into the Lok Sabha from Amritsar tomorrow, has come under Sikh attack for allegedly performing havan (a fire ritual), an act forbidden by the faith, at home.

 The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, controlled by leaders opposed to Shiromani Akali Dal chief Parkash Singh Badal, today wrote to the Akal Takht, the highest Sikh temporal authority, accusing Sidhu of religious wrongdoing and demanded action against him.

 Delhi gurdwara committee chief Paramjit Singh Sarna, who accuses the Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP combine of promoting Sangh ideology, recalled that Badals supporters had opposed a DSGMC-organised trans-border procession to Nankana Sahib in 2005 on the ground that it had a gilded palanquin as one of its main features. Those who were opposed to the palki procession should now take a stand on Navjot Singh Sidhu, Sarna said.

 Jindals test waters for land price cut 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 13: The Jindals are exploring the possibility of persuading Bengal to rework the price of land for their steel project at Salboni, a government official said.

 JSW Steel will need 4,800 acres for the 3-million-tonne plant and a 600-mw power station. This will bring the state an investment of Rs 35,000 crore, its largest ever, over 12 years.

 The land issue could figure in talks that managing director Sajjan Jindal plans to hold with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings on Wednesday.

 Theyve sought a reduction in land prices, but most businessmen try to do that. Im sure they will agree eventually, said land reforms commissioner P.K. Agarwal, who discussed land acquisition with JSW officials recently.

 According to a valuation by the West Midnapore collector, a salami of Rs 75 crore (95 per cent of the market value) must be paid for the vested government land leased for 99 years. There will also be an annual rent of 0.3 per cent. 

 However, a JSW official denied the price had been set. He said the money spent on land would not form a big part of the project cost.

 Our agreement gives the government about a year to hand over the land. It has not indicated any price. So I cant comment if its high or low. Land cost will not constitute a significant part of the project cost anyway, the official said. A survey of the plot is on for the past five weeks.

 State officials said the Jindals have sought details of the governments deal with the Tatas on the Singur land. 

 If the Jindals want the government to lower the land valuation, the land reforms department can do nothing. The decision will have to be taken by the cabinet, said land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah.

 Temper tips for Bengal teachers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 16: The government has undertaken a training programme to educate teachers against corporal punishment, worried over increasing reports of student thrashing. 

 School education minister Partha De told the Assembly today the government was all the more concerned as it felt that such behaviour by teachers and the high dropout rate among students were linked.

 We are making all efforts to retain each and every student. The tendency to beat up little boys and girls among some teachers is dangerous because first-generation learners will not go to school if they feel scared of their teachers. Therell be no one at such homes to persuade them to return to school, said De.

 Schoolteachers will be given anger management classes and taught how to motivate children to study. The teachers will also be trained in dealing with parents. 

 The process to conduct such a training has already started. Well include as many teachers as possible in the exercise, De said, replying to a question by the CPMs Pradip Ta. 

 Corporal punishment is banned in schools. According to the law, a teacher might even be dismissed for this. But the minister could not recall a single instance of such a punishment. 

 The training will include lessons in responding to accidents in school and in the face of natural calamities or fire hazards.

 Island in zone of no development

 Calcutta, Sept. 4: Experts today warned that setting up a mega chemical hub on the mud island of Nayachar would violate coastal and environmental laws.

 Although seen as relatively stable and gradually growing in size, as an uninhabited island it falls under Coastal Regulation Zone 1 (CRZ 1) where development is banned.

 No development work can be undertaken in such uninhabited coastal zones unless specifically cleared by the Centre, said Sugata Hazra, the director of the School of Oceanographic Studies in Jadavpur, who is also a member of the state Coastal Zone Management Authority.

 The estuarine island, 3km east of Haldia and 15km from the sea, comes under the coastal authority since it has a salinity level of little under 10ppt (parts per thousand). Areas with salinity levels of 5ppt and above fall under the coastal authority.

 Development is allowed in already developed CRZ 2 areas like Digha. It is also permitted to a small extent in partially built-up CRZ 3 areas like New Digha and Sankarpur or CRZ 4 areas like the Andamans, which are detached islands and need some development to be self-sufficient. But it is banned in the uninhabited CRZ 1 areas.

 The island is also home to five varieties of mangroves, which have played a major role in stabilising it and preventing coastal erosion over the years. It has a sizeable forest cover, Hazra added. 

 Officials said cutting down mangroves to build a chemical hub would not be ecologically sound.

 In need of around 10,000 acres of contiguous land near Haldia, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government is banking on Nayachar as its lone hope, especially after yesterdays meeting with political parties where the island was declared the obvious choice.

 The government has concluded that acquisition of 10,000 acres in any other area would be impossible at this point. The search for an alternative site began after the choice of Nandigram fell through.

 Yesterday, asked about reports that the island ran the risk of instability, industry minister Nirupam Sen said the soil could be technologically modified to make it suitable for development.

 The 16,000-acre island is home to a tourist bungalow and a prawn cultivation project. Some 400 fishermens families live here, of whom 500 work in the prawn project. Another 200 come from outside to work every day.

 The state has to get the proposal vetted by the coastal authority, which will forward it to the Central Coastal Zone Regulation Authority for clearance. Clearance from the Union forest ministry would also be required.

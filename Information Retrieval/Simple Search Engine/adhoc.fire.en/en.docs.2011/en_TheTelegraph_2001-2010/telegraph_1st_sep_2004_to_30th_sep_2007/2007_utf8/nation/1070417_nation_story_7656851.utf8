 Changes in public records act likely

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 16: The law that governs which government files get trashed and what gets preserved is going to be changed. 

 The culture ministry has proposed amendments that take into account some documents worth saving might be emails.

 The ministry has suggested amendments to the Public Records Act, 1993, and the Public Records Rules, 1997, to take up the challenge of managing e-records. Apart from that, the public records law needs to be examined to see if it is in sync with the new Right to Information Act, officials say.

 The public records act and rules ban government departments from destroying documents that are more than 25 years old, unless they have been appraised.

 The National of India, under the culture ministry, and similar bodies at the state level are required to keep tabs on public records, and help government departments separate worthless files from those that must be saved.

 The documents considered to be of permanent nature but no longer required by the department which created them are then shifted to the archives for safekeeping. There, they can be seen by research scholars.

 The acts definition of public records includes material produced by a computer but the act and rules do not elaborate how e-records will be picked for saving or deleting.

 The process of amending the act and the rules is now at a preliminary stage. The culture ministry will collaborate with the department of personnel and training to come up with a draft of the proposed amendment. This could take a year, an official said. 

 The review of the act and rules will also consider spelling out how the national archives, with branches in states, will share the responsibility of helping government departments manage their files.

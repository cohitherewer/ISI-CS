 Cheat charge off Monica

 Bhopal, July 16: A Bhopal court today cleared Monica Bedi of passport fraud, but the starlet who wants to be a news anchor will have to wait a while before she takes a shot at realising her ambition. 

 A Hyderabad court had sentenced her in another passport forgery case and a little more than a year is still left of her prison term.

 In Bhopal, chief judicial magistrate Ajay Shrivastava said there wasnt enough evidence to nail Monica and rapped the prosecution for its failure to book passport officials who had issued her a fake document.

 The case against Monica had been registered in November 2001 for allegedly using the fictitious name Fauzia Osman.

 As soon as the magistrate announced the verdict, Monica, extradited from Portugal in November 2005 along with gangster Abu Salem, smiled and whispered something to her lawyer P.C. Vedi.

 Vedi later said she told him the verdict was unimaginable.

 She was depressed and lost before the verdict was pronounced. It came as a pleasant surprise to her and to me, too, Vedi said.

 He said Monica, who spent a tense weekend reading the Bible and offering puja, had all along maintained that the charges against her were not justified. The prosecution failed to produce a single witness, Vedi said.

 Asked what Monica intends to do once she got out of jail, Vedi said she was keen to become a news anchor and would also like to resume her Bollywood career.

 The acquittal in Bhopal came two days after her lawyer alleged that a spy camera was secretly trailing her inside her Central Jail barracks, a charge denied by Bhopal jail authorities.

 Monicas sartorial taste also came under public scrutiny when two Congress MLAs in Madhya Pradesh raised the issue in the Assembly. They wondered how she could be so fit and fine while in jail.

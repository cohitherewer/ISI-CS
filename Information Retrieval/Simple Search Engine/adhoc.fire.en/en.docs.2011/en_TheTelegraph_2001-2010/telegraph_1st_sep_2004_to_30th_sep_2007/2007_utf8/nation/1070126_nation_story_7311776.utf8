 Bottle no bar to insurance

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 25: You cannot be denied mediclaim payment just because you are a drinker, the Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has ruled.

 You can be denied only if the doctor certifies that the disease was caused solely by taking intoxicating drugs and alcohol in heavy quantity, Justice J.D. Kapoor stressed.

 Insurance companies should change their mindset and should not be bogged down in the old and orthodox views about drinking habits of society and persons living in modern days of stress and strain, he said. 

 A moderate amount of alcohol, up to four drinks a day for men and two drinks a day for women, is actually better than not drinking at all, the judge said quoting a study on the subject. The study says moderate drinking reduces the risk of death from any cause by about 18 per cent.

 So even if a patient drinks every day in moderation, he cannot be denied mediclaim benefits.

 The study also found that when a man and a woman drank the same amount of alcohol, the woman recorded a higher blood-alcohol level, the judge said. But he added that he had referred to the study for the purpose of insurance claim and for no other purpose, nor as an advisory or a suggestion.

 Justice Kapoor said the same study had also found that things changed radically when consumption exceeded these levels.

 The commission was hearing a petition by Oriental Insurance, which had refused to pay the medical expenses of Karan Sehgal who had taken out a policy for one year.

 Sehgal was admitted to hospital in October 2004 after he vomited blood half-a-dozen times and complained of pain in the abdomen. The discharge summary mentioned that he used to take alcohol but didnt say how much.

 The commission rejected the companys petition, saying it was common for people to drink at social gatherings.

 The commission noted that insurance companies gave out policies only after a panel of doctors ruled out pre-existing disease, yet they later sought to invoke the exclusion clause.

 The list of donts in the present case, common to almost all policies and companies, included congenital defects, venereal diseases and the use of intoxicating drugs and alcohol.

 An order by a state consumer commission is binding on all district consumer courts in that state. It has a persuasive value in other states unless there are contrary decisions by their own state commissions.

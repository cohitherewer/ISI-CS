 Pre-primary relief to Delhi kids

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: School children in Delhi will now have only one year of pre-primary education, beginning Class I at the age of five, the government announced today. 

 The cabinet decision comes four months after Delhi High Court had asked the government to ensure that children start formal school education once they turn four. 

 Children will now be granted admission to nursery only after their fourth birthday. We have agreed to the courts demand, central education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely said this evening. 

 The court had set up a committee of experts headed by CBSE chief Ashok Ganguly to examine nursery admissions, after parents complained that children were facing admission pressure too early. 

 The committee had submitted a proposal to the court in March suggesting a mechanism, under which the pre-primary classes, popularly known as nursery and kindergarten, were to be compressed into one year.

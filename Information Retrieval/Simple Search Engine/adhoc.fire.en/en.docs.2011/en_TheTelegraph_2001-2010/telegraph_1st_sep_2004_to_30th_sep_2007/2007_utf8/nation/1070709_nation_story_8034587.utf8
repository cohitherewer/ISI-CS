The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Polite tenant, skilled doctor 

 The apartment block (top) where Mohammed Haneef (below) used to live on the Gold Coast 

 Melbourne, July 8 (PTI): When Mohammed Haneef moved into his new apartment in Australia in September, his meagre possessions were packed in plastic bags. 

 For weeks, the 27-year-old, now a suspect in the failed UK terror plot, and wife Firdous slept on the floor till a bed and a couch were delivered, the Courier Mail reported today. 

 There was no TV in the Gold Coast apartment and one of the two rooms seemed to be set aside for prayers, with religious posters in Arabic and English on the walls. 

 Haneef always paid his $250-a-week rent on time and was polite to the point of being meek, the paper quoted the apartment blocks managers, Steve and Meryl Boscher, as saying. His unit was a short walk from the Gold Coast Hospital where Haneef worked.

 When he turned up to apply for the unit, speaking flawless English with a British accent, Haneef had no photo identification but had his Queensland health employment contract, the Boschers said. They only needed to make a quick assessment of his character and look at his salary to give the nod. 

 The Boschers cannot recall his exact pay, but remember it exceeded the average salary of most residents. Haneef certainly didnt blink when asked to pay four weeks bond and two weeks advance rent, they said. 

 Neighbours found him a hard-working doctor at the accident and emergency ward. He did 10-hour shifts, eight times a fortnight. They fitted in, a hospital employee said. 

 Alarm bells rang only once, when a colleague was surprised by Haneefs ability. He was working with a specialist on a patient who required surgery for a serious prostate problem.

 I couldnt understand why, if he was so good, he had ended up in a dead-end job like this. The Gold Coast Hospital is not seen as a hotbed in the medical world, she told a colleague. 

 Haneefs face was known at the Arundel mosque, the Gold Coasts only one, said imam Imraan Husain. He has been coming to the mosque but not that strictly. My impression of him is a very peaceful, spiritual person. 

 A cousin in India said Haneef had been appalled at the 7/7 London bombings. She told The Sunday Times of London: I remember Mohammed saying, Because of these bloody people, others will suffer. Now innocent Muslims will be double-checked everywhere they go. People like us work so hard to earn the respect of society and look what happens.

 Haneef was the familys breadwinner, another relative said, and was putting brother Shoaib through engineering college in Bangalore. His father died a decade ago, and he has a mother, brother, sister, wife and child to look after.

 House search

 Australian police today searched Haneefs residence and the home of Mohammed Asif Ali, who was questioned but released without charge.

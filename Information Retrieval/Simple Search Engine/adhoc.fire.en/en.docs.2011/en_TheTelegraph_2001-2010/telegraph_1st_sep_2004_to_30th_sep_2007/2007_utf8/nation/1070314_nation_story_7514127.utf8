 Marry, but after 30: GeNew

 New Delhi, March 13 (PTI): Marrying in haste and repenting at leisure is out for GeNew: they feel the right age to get hitched and have kids is the thirties.

 You could call it a sign of the changing times or shifting priorities, but almost 79 per cent Indian youngsters questioned for a recent survey have vouched for the thirties, higher than the global figure of 77 per cent.

 The new generation is more career-oriented and reluctant to assume other responsibilities before their career objectives are fulfilled, said Sarang Panchal, executive director, South Asia of AC Nielsen, which did the survey.

 He said the growing trend was possibly fuelled by people reaching a degree of stability in their careers around 30. Besides, Indian women were getting more career-oriented and less willing to place family before their jobs.

 The survey threw up another surprise fewer youngsters looked on it as the goal of their lives. Only 53 per cent in India said it was a life goal, one of the lowest in the Asia-Pacific region.

 But for 61 per cent people globally, marriage remained a major goal, with 87 per cent Indonesians giving it priority. 

 The survey found Indians more willing to accept working mothers, with 73 per cent saying they could hold jobs. This is, however, less than the 89 per cent vote Chinese working mothers got.

 But the one thing that remained constant amid these changes was marriage was for a lifetime. A high percentage in the Asia Pacific region vouched for this, surprisingly more men (76 per cent) than women (64 per cent). About 87 per cent Indian respondents said they preferred marriages that only death would part.

 Marriage still holds a special place in the hearts of people. About 87 per cent respondents in India felt marriage is meant for life. This is much higher than the 72 per cent figure for Asia Pacific and the global figure of 70 per cent, Panchal said.

 About 94 per cent Indians intended to have children after marriage, the highest in the region. 

 Almost 92 per cent believed children whose parents remained married were happier and more stable than those whose parents were separated.

 Jodhpur, Aug. 29: Salman Khan was today forced to spend another long night in Jodhpur Central Jail after a judge hearing the actors chinkara bail plea recused himself from the case.

 Justice G.K. Vyas of Rajasthan High Court refused to hear the application amid high emotion and legal drama, apparently because he was the counsel for the veterinarian who did the post-mortem on the chinkara.

 After Vyas directed Salmans lawyers to approach another bench, the team sounded Justice H.R. Panwar out. The case has been listed for hearing tomorrow.

 The court will hear our plea tomorrow, Salmans lawyer Dipesh Mehta confirmed after coming out of the court. The stars sisters, Alvira and Arpita, were also present.

 If Salman does not get bail tomorrow, he might have to spend the weekend in jail. A lawyers strike has been called by the Jodhpur Bar Council on Friday.

 Usually, judges call for trial court records which could take up to a day. Nevertheless, it is the discretion of the judge, high court lawyer Anil Kaviraj said.

 The application may then come up for hearing on Monday. If Salmans lawyers do not manage to convince the court that day, the star will have to spend Janmasthami on Tuesday in jail, too.

 With the judges decision being seen as a setback to Salman, the high court corridors were buzzing with speculation on when he would finally emerge from the barracks. Salman has very few sympathisers even outside the Bishnoi community. 

 For many in Jodhpur, teaching Salman a lesson has virtually become an ego issue. It is as though a fiercely proud community wants to show a spoilt brat from Mumbai that in Jodhpur he is not above the law.

 Salman is likely to spend another anxious night after eating the bhindi and roti that is on the dinner menu. Whether he is praying silently for release is anyones guess, but jail authorities claimed he had given up reading in his quest for spirituality.

 The actor lost his appeal in the Jodhpur district and sessions court against the five-year sentence in the chinkara poaching case handed out by the chief judicial magistrate on April 10.

 Tatas 

told to 

clear off 

highway

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, May 28: The demolition squad at Munnar has asked the Tatas to vacate a 0.75-km stretch of a national highway by May 30 or face eviction.

 A notice was sent to the regional manager of Tata Tea this morning by the Devikolam-based assistant executive engineer for planting tea in violation of lease rights.

 The stretch, on the Kochi-Madurai highway, runs through the companys tea plantation. However, K. Suresh Kumar, picked for the demolition job at the hill resort by chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan, has granted a hearing to the Tata representative on Tuesday.

 The firm was found to have encroached on either side of the road running through its contiguous estate. The area (on both sides of the stretch) is 2.53 acres, valued at less than Rs 5 crore.

 The Tata firm was reportedly given 56,000 acres, of which 23,000 are for plantation and the rest for firewood. 

 A state-sponsored survey by the National Remote Sensing Satellite of the Tata land is expected to be completed in another three months. Sources say the survey will show how much of the area is being used for activities other than tea.

 Achuthanandan, undeterred by controversies generated by his detractors, has taken his demolition drive into the second phase. And the heat is now on the Tatas, who have leased the largest stretch of land at Munnar.

 The chief minister was quoted as saying in a recent interview that big sharks must be snared first. Tata Tea has grabbed 50,000 acres of prime land in Munnar. I have asked the special task force to get it vacated at the earliest, he said.

 Tata Tea has denied allegations it encroached land or misused lease rights. The firm recently handed over control of the estate to Kannan Devan Hills Plantations, a company floated by workers.

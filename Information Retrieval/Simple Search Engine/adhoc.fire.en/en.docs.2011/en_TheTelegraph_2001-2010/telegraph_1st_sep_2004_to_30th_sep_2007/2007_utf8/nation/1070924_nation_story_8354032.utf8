 Nod for infertility drug amid warning of deformity 

 G.S. MUDUR 

 New Delhi, Sept. 23: Indias drug regulators have approved a drug called letrozole for infertility treatment in women although Novartis, its original manufacturer, has warned doctors not to prescribe it for this purpose. 

 The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation has allowed the use of letrozole for induction of ovulation in infertile women as an additional use.

 The drug was earlier approved only for treatment of breast cancer in post-menopausal women. 

 However, advisories sent by Novartis to doctors in India and elsewhere have cautioned that there have been reports of congenital defects in the infants of mothers exposed to letrozole for the treatment of infertility. 

 Its surprising Indias drug control agency has approved this product for infertility treatment, said Chandra Gulhati, editor of the Monthly Index of Medical Specialities, India, a journal on drugs. 

 Even clinical studies are ethically questionable because the drug is contraindicated for pre-menopausal women.

 Novartis issued advisories after doctors in North America and India began to give this breast cancer drug to treat infertility and reported success, more than four years ago.

 The company had warned that letrozole should not be given to women who are still in a pre-menopausal status, or during pregnancy and lactation, because of the potential for maternal and foetal toxicity and foetal malformation.

 Drug control officials said the approval was in response to an application by an Indian manufacturer of generic drugs . It is based on clinical data submitted by the local manufacturer, Mamidanna Venkateswarlu, the drugs controller-general of India, told The Telegraph.

 We have no information about the advisory by Novartis. If they have a concern, they should share it. Well examine it. 

 A spokesperson for the local manufacturer, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, said many clinical trials in India and several other countries over the past two years support the use of letrozole in the induction of ovulation to treat infertility. 

 The company said there is no difference in the overall rates of congenital malformations among newborns from mothers who had conceived after using letrozole or another drug called clomifene, the conventional drug for infertility. 

 Several doctors in India said they were unaware of the advisory. Weve never been informed about problems with the drug, said Prakash Trivedi, the chairman of the infertility section of the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Societies of India. 

 No one has kept track of the number of women who have received letrozole for infertility in India illegally before April 10, 2007, the date when it was approved for this use or legally after that date. 

 If this is a safe and effective drug for infertility treatment, why isnt the original innovator (Novartis) promoting it for this use? Gulhati said. 

 The market is much bigger and more profitable in the US and Europe than in India. 

 A Novartis spokesperson told The Telegraph that with even currently available research and clinical data, the company believes it would not be appropriate to use letrozole. for fertility treatment.

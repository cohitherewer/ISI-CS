 Sriharikota/New Delhi, April 23: The Indian Space Research Organisation broke into the global market for full-fledged commercial launches with a roaring start today as its workhorse rocket successfully ferried an Italian astronomical satellite into orbit.

 The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)-C8 lifted off from a launch pad at 3:30 pm, leaving behind a thick trail of white smoke and high-decibel rumbling, and injected satellite AGILE into orbit 23 minutes later.

 Isro scientists led by chairman G. Madhavan Nair and their Italian counterparts watched the flight path of the PSLV from the mission control centre as each of its four stages behaved as intended before letting go of AGILE in an equatorial orbit about 550 km above Earth.

 This was the 10th consecutive successful flight of the PSLV. Although Isro used the PSLV earlier to launch satellites for Korea, Germany, Belgium, Argentina and Indonesia, the AGILE contract is the first exclusive commercial launch won against stiff international competition. All previous foreign satellites that had piggybacked with Isros own satellites as the main passengers were smaller.

 Nair called the missions success a historic moment for Indias space community and praised the Italian Space Agency for picking Isro to launch its satellite despite a very complex competitive environment.

 A European scientific satellite has been put in a precise orbit by a totally Indian-built rocket system. We have again proved the reliability of our launch system and weve made it cost-effective and delivered on time, he said.

 Its an intense emotional moment for us. You cannot imagine anything better, and it was better than what we even expected, said Giovani Bignami, president of the Italian Space Agency who witnessed the launch.

 Describing Isros achievement as the beginning of a new phase of collaboration between Italy and India in space, Bignami said the launch marked an important score for India. Isro has shown a remarkable degree of calm and professionalism, which is what we wanted.

 Although Isro did not send its own satellite this time, it used the flight to test advanced launch vehicle avionics a complex network of onboard electronics, computers, and sensors that will be used in the control and navigation of its future launch vehicles.

 AGILE is intended to be a powerful and cost-effective satellite to study enigmatic objects in astronomy remains of dead stars, black holes and gamma ray bursts that represent some of the most energetic phenomena in the universe.

 The astronomical satellite is expected to serve the global scientific community for three to four years, Nair said. As in previous launches of foreign satellites, Antrix, the commercial wing of the space department, bid for it.

 Antrix officials declined to specify the value of the contract, but officials earlier said that launches from India will be cheaper than commercial launches offered by Europe, Russia or the US.

 Mumbai, Sept. 28: Call them Twenty20 parties. No introductions and slow starts, no sleepless nights spent planning and working out the budget just get off the blocks straightaway.

 And they are for the young.

 While thousands of Indians descended on the streets after the ICC World Twenty20 triumph, many teens and twenty somethings never stepped out of their homes. Armed with computers, they partied through the night, online.

 Log on to Orkut and Facebook and you can get a taste of the celebrations that kicked off moments after the victory. An Orkut community called Chak De Indian Cricket Teamrox was created at 9.33pm on Monday, less than an hour after the win.

 Facebook, another social networking website, set up a community called Chak de India 24 September 07 Historic Day. Showing a fine strike rate, it registered 409 members in two days.

 We log in at the same time to have a blast online. What better way to celebrate the victory than to create communities hailing our heroes? People from other countries will feel so jealous, especially those whose teams lost to us, said Rahul Chedia.

 The young men and women say online parties are great fun without the hassles of a real-world bash.

 We dont spend a penny. No cover charges, no girlfriend trouble, no deadlines. Except that if I am online from home, I have to go easy on the drinking part. Otherwise its fun, said Ankush, 20.

 How do you start or join an online party?

 All you need to do is post a scrap on the community page informing everyone of the time and date of the party. Then they can manage their schedules and be ready to exchange scraps, Ankush said.

 Imagine an Indian sitting in America, sharing his joy at the victory with you through scraps and messages online. I couldnt have gone and partied with him at a disco, but here on Orkut we can share this glorious moment.

 Muzamil Ahmed, a fan from the UAE, has posted a global invite on Facebook for a party on September 28-29.

 Several online communities have been created and dedicated to Mahendra Singh Dhonis champions. They are well spread out, with members from India, America, the UAE and other countries.

 The three men currently ruling the world of Twenty20 cyber parties are Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh and the temperamental S. Sreesanth.

 The Kerala pacer has over 20 communities dedicated to him on Orkut. One of them, called Sreesanth Dancing Sensation, has 815 members who pay homage his dancing skills and on-field antics.

 The sites are clear about the most memorable moment of the ICC World Twenty20 Yuvrajs six sixes in an over.

 Dhoni, whose captaincy is a popular topic of conversation at most parties, has a fan club on Orkut called Dhoni Repeats a Kapil with over 60,000 members.

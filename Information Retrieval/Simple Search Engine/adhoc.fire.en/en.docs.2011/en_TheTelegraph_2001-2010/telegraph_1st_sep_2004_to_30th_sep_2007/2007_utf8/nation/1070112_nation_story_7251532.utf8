 Liz plans pink wedding

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

Mumbai, Jan. 11: Elizabeth Hurley has planned a pink wedding. So whats the big deal, you might wonder. She wants all her guests in pink, too!

 Not just that, they have to be dressed in Indian outfits.

 But lest her international celeb friends go pale with panic, Liz has thoughtfully sent them an orientation pack and decided to set up a store housing Indian designer wear, where they can shop before they drop in at her wedding.

 The most talked-about event on Mumbais social calendar will take place at Rajasthans Devigarh Palace on March 9. 

 Victoria and David Beckham, Sir Elton John and a host of other American and British celebrities will watch Liz tie the knot with multi-billionaire businessman Arun Nayyar. The couple would have walked up the aisle a week before on March 3 at Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire.

 While the ladies are expected to wear pink sarees or other traditional Indian attire, the gentlemen will sport pink turbans on the main wedding day. On all other occasions, the dress code has been mentioned to be glamorous and fabulous, said a former Mumbai model and columnist who is on the guest list.

 The note part of the orientation pack listing the dress code also asks the invitees not to worry. All Indian clothes can be bought when you arrive in India, where they will be much nicer.

 The bride and groom are reportedly planning to set up the private wedding shop at Mumbais Hilton Towers Hotel, the former model said. But the hotel administration refused to confirm it.

 Top Indian designers will contribute traditional Indian wedding outfits to the store. The main colours would be various shades of pink. There will be outfits for both men and women and tailors at hand to make immediate alterations. There will be sherwanis, turbans, sarees, ghagra cholis the whole range. It will be a huge opportunity for Indian designers to showcase their work and everybody is excited. Liz herself is putting together the collection for the store, said the former model.

 Arun, incidentally, is a textile magnate and his 40-year-old model-actress fiance has recently turned designer. 

 The six-day wedding extravaganza will include two parties in Mumbai, followed by a mehendi ceremony in Rajasthan, a moonlit dinner, a black-tie pre-wedding party and the nuptial ceremony for which Liz will wear a Rs 3.2-lakh pink saree by Tarun Tahiliani. 

 She has ordered 13 outfits designed by Donatella Versace and Indian designers for her wedding bashes.

 The orientation pack lists the various Indian functions in detail and also mentions a pre-wedding cricket match between the brides and the grooms friends.

 And last but not the least, a word of caution from the soon-to-be Indian bahu: Dont forget to bring mosquito repellents and a travel iron.

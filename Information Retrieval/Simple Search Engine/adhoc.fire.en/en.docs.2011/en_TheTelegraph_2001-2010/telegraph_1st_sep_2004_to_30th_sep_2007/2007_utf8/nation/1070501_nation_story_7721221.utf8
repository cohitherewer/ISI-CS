 Tongue trouble

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 30: Union rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, who had threatened to pull out Nitish Kumars tongue, had to eat his words today.

 Besieged by rivals in the Lok Sabha bristling at the insult to the Bihar chief minister, Raghuvansh reluctantly said the remark was just a turn of phrase. 

 No tongues were being pulled out, he said, adding the words were not to be taken in their literal sense. It was just a muhawara (an idiom) popular with villagers.

 Janata Dal (United) leader Prabhunath Singh raised the issue during zero hour, demanding either an apology from Raghuvansh or his expulsion from the ministry.

 Raghuvansh withdrew his statement but went on to explain the logic behind it. Nitish and his colleagues, he complained, had been accusing Union ministers of hindering the progress on a project to widen Bihar highways.

 But few in the House had the patience to hear him out. The BJPs V.K. Malhotra cut him short by asking: Did you say it or not? Tell us.

 Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said whatever the provocation, such words shouldnt be used. I do not approve of it.

 Lanka terror on Saarc plate

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 28: India will reiterate the need to find a political solution to the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka in the wake of the LTTE air raid when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh meets Sri Lankas President Mahinda Rajapakse during next weeks Saarc summit.

 Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon told a news conference today that India is very concerned about the situation in Sri Lanka and we hope to use our conversations at the Saarc summit to encourage Sri Lanka to find solutions to the conflict.

 The Saarc summit, to be held here, is likely to focus on a sub-continental approach to dealing with terrorism, considering that India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan have been its victims for several decades. 

 Menon pointed out that the LTTE attack on an air force base near Colombo earlier this week was a manifestation of the 250-year-old ethnic conflict, implying that Colombo needed to work hard at finding a political, not a military, solution to it. 

 Tension has been brewing between Delhi and Colombo in recent months, precisely because India feels that Rajapakses government is unwilling to push for a political solution.

 India has repeatedly said Sri Lanka should abandon its unitary constitution in favour of a more federal structure that takes into account the aspirations of the Tamils in the north and the east, but Colombo has so far turned a deaf ear.

 Delhi feels that if the situation worsens, Tamil refugees would probably begin pouring into Tamil Nadu, thereby creating a humanitarian crisis for India. 

 The humanitarian consequences really worry us, Menon said at the news conference. 

 Asked if India and Bangladesh would also focus on terrorism during their bilateral talks at the Saarc summit, Menon said yes. 

 While Dhaka has sent signals that it will take action against Indian insurgent camps within Bangladesh, Delhi hopes the talks between the Prime Minister and Bangladeshs chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed will yield a firmer commitment against terrorism.

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Block VIP on road, take a hit

Road bullies are of all shapes, forms and status. And in Mumbai, even the bodyguards of VIPs can throw their weight and blows like those they protect.

 A complaint was recently lodged against a bodyguard of Nilesh, revenue minister Narayan Ranes son for causing hurt and criminal intimidation.

 The trouble began when Nileshs car was overtaken by some bike-borne youths. Irritated with their refusal to give way to the VIP vehicle, the bodyguard stopped the boys and demanded an explanation. 

 We are told there was a heated argument, after which the bodyguard allegedly hit one of the youths and also threatened him, a senior police official said.

 The security officer involved in the incident wasnt named, but a complaint was filed against him under Sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation).

 Million-dollar gesture

Charity begins at home. But for some, it could well start with weddings. ADMK MLA S. V. Shekhar didnt really donate a million dollars to a cause that has been close to his heart. Instead, he went ahead and organised mass weddings for the physically challenged.

 Some 80 parents met and fixed at least 10 alliances for their handicapped children across the table at the Thirumana Utsavam. It means a marriage festival in Tamil.

 The event, held at the Sanskrit College in Shekhars Mylapore constituency, was organised with the help of a charitable trust. And, the actor-turned-lawmaker did the honours himself, lighting a traditional lamp and basking in the glow of the admiration.

 Flyover fetish before Games

Delhi may have lost the Asian Games to South Korea s Incheon, but the capitals government seems as enthusiastic as ever about the 2010 Commonwealth Games. 

 In the latest of a slew of infrastructure projects planned for completion by the time the Games come around, as many as 19 flyovers are to be built during 2008-09.

 Responding to criticism from city planners that the government was neglecting the citys larger development by focusing too much on the Games, officials say only five flyovers are directly related to the sports event. 

 Only five of the 19 flyovers are on the route from the Games Village (now being built in east Delhi) to the main stadium where events will take place. The rest will benefit ordinary people. The Games are merely being used as a target to push ourselves on the task, said a senior official of the Delhi government. 

 Green wedding

No electricity, no plastic and no expensive exotic food that isnt a marriage bash many would be excited about.

 But Akhil Shah and Namrata Kothari, who got hitched recently, broke new ground with their green wedding.

 The 1,500 guests at the Chembur venue were ushered in to the strains, not of the usual shehnai, but Darpa, a slender wind instrument made from dried gourd.

 At sunset, the flickering lights from castor oil lamps lent the place a surreal feel. Marigold, mango leaves and fronds of coconut palm adorned the mandap. 

 ne guest remarked this was how wedding pandals might have looked like in pre-electricity days.

Delhi: Treat yourself to a visual extravaganza at the India International Centre annexe with Pranab Basus latest exhibition of abstract paintings in acrylic, oil and water.

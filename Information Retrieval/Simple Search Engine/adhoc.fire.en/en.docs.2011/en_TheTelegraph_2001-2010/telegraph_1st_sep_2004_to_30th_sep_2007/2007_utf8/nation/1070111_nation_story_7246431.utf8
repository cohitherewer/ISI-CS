 New Delhi, Jan 10: The government today placed all airports across the country on high alert after receiving intelligence inputs that Kashmir militants may try to hijack an aircraft before Republic Day. 

 A civil aviation ministry spokesperson said all airports have been on alert for the past four days due to the threat perception.

 The civil aviation ministry today held a series of meetings with officials of the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), intelligence agencies, the home ministry and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) to take stock of the situation.

 Officials said the BCAS has instructed the CISF to introduce a second layer of baggage checks and body searches to cope with the threat. 

 BCAS sources said the special screening procedures would continue for at least this month.

 Airport officials said among other things, there would be stricter control on access to airports, heightened surveillance, peripheral security, increased profiling, x-ray and physical checks of hand baggage and restrictions on carrying liquid and gels on board.

 Carrying fluids will continue to be banned on flights and only 100-ml transparent water bottles will be allowed.

 Quick reaction and disaster management teams have been activated at all airports while bomb disposal squads and sniffer dogs have been brought into the major ones.

 Special armed teams have been asked to patrol the city-side, the technical term for non-operational areas in airports, as well as in areas like the cargo complex.

 Officials also said, as a long term measure, they are trying to beef up other security systems by streamlining airport access with the help of smart cards, introducing passenger profiling and strengthening of cockpit doors of aircraft of state-run airlines.

 Security agencies have already started monitoring passengers by installing closed circuit televisions in many airports.

 They have also asked airlines to install sophisticated communication systems on planes so that cabin crew can communicate with ground staff during a hijack, sources said.

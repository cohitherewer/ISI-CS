 CM holds up new-age Left 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 19: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today defended his vision of industrialisation and development by dubbing it ei juger bampantha (the Left politics of this age).

 Addressing a rally organised by Citu, the CPMs labour wing, at Shahid Minar, the chief minister sought to silence his critics by asserting that the path hes chosen to tread on is the one the party should follow at present.

 Transformation from agriculture to industry, rural to urban is inevitable. We must move ahead in industry and join the competition among states to get investments because we need to create more jobs for fresh graduates. We are doing it without ignoring agriculture.

 At the same time, he made it clear he wasnt forcing his policies on the unwilling. If people dont appreciate our efforts, we will not force them. We have to ensure people arent in tears bearing the pain of development. The comment was addressed to those who accuse him of being harsh and hasty in his development drive.

 Bhattacharjee sought to make a distinction between the protests in Singur and Nandigram. In Singur, he said most farmers supported the move to set up the Tata Motors unit. In Nandigram, the people failed to appreciate the governments plan to turn the area into a second Haldia. 

 He expressed regret for the March 14 police firing and said no land would be acquired there. But he left no doubt that the proposed chemical hub originally planned in Nandigram would come up elsewhere. He will visit Haldia on April 24 

 Bhattacharjee will hold discussions with Left academics, writers and artists on April 21, his first meeting with them after the Nandigram violence.

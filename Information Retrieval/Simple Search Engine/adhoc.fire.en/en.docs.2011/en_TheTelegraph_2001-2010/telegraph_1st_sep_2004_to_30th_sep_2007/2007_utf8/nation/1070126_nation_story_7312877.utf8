 Blasts on R-Day eve

 OUR BUREAU

 Jan. 25: At least two persons were killed and 10 injured as Ulfa carried out a series of blasts in several districts of Assam on the eve of Republic Day.

 A suspected Ulfa militant was blown up when the bomb he was carrying on a bicycle accidentally exploded at Borhatjan in Tinsukia district around 5 pm.

 A senior police official of the district said it was evident from the incident that the outfits activists were ferrying bombs, probably intended for use tomorrow. 

 Ulfa militants also struck at a busy market near the Radha Krishna temple in Kamrup district around 6.30 pm. One person, identified as Kushal Baniya, was killed and eight people were injured when a powerful improvised explosive device exploded at a bus terminus. 

 The police suspect the bomb was kept in a bicycle. 

 Around the same time, militants set off another explosion at Kachari basti in Guwahati. The bomb had been concealed in a dustbin. No casualty was reported. 

 Ulfa militants exploded two other bombs at isolated places in Hajo and Rangia. There was no casualty. 

 Dispur further hardened its stand against the rebels today. Governor Lt Gen. (retd) Ajai Singh said they would have to first surrender their arms and ammunition before their demand for the release of five jailed senior leaders could be considered. 

 Earlier, the government had merely laid down the condition that Ulfa would have to give an undertaking that it would sit down for talks if it wanted its leaders released. 

 Gen. Singh said there was no possibility of the government declaring a ceasefire again. They are not interested in holding talks, though the government has kept its doors open, he said.

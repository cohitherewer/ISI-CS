 Malaria hope in deadly gas

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, May 20: Carbon monoxide may help combat life-threatening cerebral malaria, scientists have said after showing that the poisonous gas can protect mice from the deadly complication.

 The experiments on mice were done by scientists in Portugal. 

 At the Institute of Molecular Medicine in Lisbon, Maria Mota and her colleagues have shown that carbon monoxide is able to prevent a sequence of biochemical events that lead to cerebral malaria in mice infected with a parasite called Plasmodium bergei, which mimics the disease caused by Plasmodium falciparum in humans. 

 Inhalation of a non-toxic dose of carbon monoxide protected all the infected mice who were likely to get cerebral malaria, Mota, a biologist who specialises in malaria, said. 

 The infected mice were kept in special chambers where the carbon monoxide level was 250 parts per million, a dose completely non-toxic for the mice, she said. 

 In a report published last Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine, the scientists said their findings may lead to a new treatment strategy to suppress the pathological changes associated with cerebral malaria, an infection that kills over a million people worldwide each year. 

 In India, health authorities have had to deal with cerebral malaria in eastern and northeastern states. In the mid-1990s, Rajasthan had an outbreak of cerebral malaria. 

 In malaria infection, the destruction of red blood cells leads to the release of a molecule called heme into the blood. The new research shows that this free heme is a key cause of the complications of cerebral malaria. 

 The scientists have shown that the protective effect of carbon monoxide is through its ability to prevent the accumulation of heme in the body. Mice that have high levels of this enzyme are protected from cerebral malaria, while mice that lack it succumb to it.

 Jaitley cheer for Modi

 New Delhi, July 20: Arun Jaitley has been put in charge of Gujarat as the BJPs central representative in a move that signals Narendra Modi would have a free run in his state in the run-up to the Assembly elections.

 Jaitley and Modi are close political and personal associates and go back to the days when the Gujarat chief minister was a state functionary trying to gain a toehold in Delhi politics. 

 He latched on to Jaitley who was already picked as general secretary by L.K. Advani and regarded as one of the rising stars with Sushma Swaraj and the late Pramod Mahajan.

 BJP president Rajnath Singh announced Jaitleys new responsibility. The general secretary was assigned the charge of Uttar Pradesh after the BJPs rout in the last Assembly polls. 

 With two plum states on his worksheet, Jaitley has become one of the most powerful members of Rajnaths team, despite the party chiefs earlier attempt to sideline him. 

 Jaitley was dropped from the panel of spokespersons in a move that was meant to bring the media-savvy leader down by a notch or two.

 His new mandate was also seen by BJP insiders as Rajnaths way of buying peace with Modi whose wings, too, he tried to clip when he dropped him from the parliamentary board, the partys highest decision-making body.

 Modi faces a fresh wave of dissidence from the BJP four months before the elections. It was evident when 15 of his MLAs reportedly voted for Pratibha Patil in the presidential election and another 15 played hookey. 

 Although the total number of dissidents, 30 by most reckoning, is not enough to topple his government Modi still has the support of 100 central leaders were concerned about the damage they could do in the elections, specially if they were denied tickets.

 It is believed that Modi is disinclined to oblige Rajnath and has made it clear that, as in the last election, he would not brook any active intervention from Delhi. 

 In the circumstances, when even Rajnath would not wish to annoy Modi, Jaitley was seen as the best candidate for a perfect Delhi-Gandhinagar fit. 

 There was another reason for asking Jaitley to oversee Gujarat, said the source. Jaitley was seen as a bridge of sorts between Modi and the RSS. 

 Neither Modi nor the Sangh have any love lost for each other. But the BJP does not want the RSS and the VHP to work against it to spite Modi.

 Pune/Mumbai, Aug. 22: Five hundred days in jail is agony enough, but the last three must have been the most excruciating for Sanjay Dutt.

 As hundreds of fans cheered outside Punes Yerwada jail, waiting for their hero to emerge from behind the prison gates, the Bollywood star was resigned to one more night behind bars.

 Given a reprieve on Monday by the Supreme Court, Sanjay will have to wait till tomorrow to walk free because the warrant for his release could not reach the jail by the 5pm deadline.

 Mumbai terror court judge Pramod Kode, who had convicted the actor in the Bombay blasts case, ordered his release today but bail formalities took up almost the entire day.

 Earlier, delay in acquiring a certified copy of the apex courts bail order and reaching it to Mumbai had prevented the stars release.

 Sources in the Pune prison said Sanjay who spent 16 months behind bars in the early nineties could hear his fans cheering. He is very frustrated, and understandably so. He can hear all the chaos happening outside, said activist Asim Sarode, who has interacted with Sanjay.

 While Sanjay steeled himself for another long night, a lawyer for the actor said he wanted to visit the Dagadu Seth Ganesh temple once he was released. 

 Sanjay has visited this temple before and wants to go there again, the lawyer said.

 In Pune, the fans had been keeping watch on a yellow box where release warrants have to be deposited by 5pm.

 Away in Mumbai, Sanjays lawyers Satish Maneshinde and Farhana Shah produced a copy of the apex court order before Kode, who directed them to file separate bail applications.

 Outside Yerwada, as news broke that the lawyers were still in court at 4.30pm, hopes began fading.

 In Mumbai, Maneshinde said he would leave for Pune early tomorrow. Sources said Sanjays sisters Priya and Namrata and his girlfriend Maanyata would accompany him.

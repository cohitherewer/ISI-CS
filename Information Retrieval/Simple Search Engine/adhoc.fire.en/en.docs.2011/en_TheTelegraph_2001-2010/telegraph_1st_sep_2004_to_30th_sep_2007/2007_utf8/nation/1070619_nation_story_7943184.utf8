 Murder glare on ticket checkers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Thiruvananthapuram, June 18: A magistrate has ordered framing of murder charges against six ticket examiners who allegedly pushed a youth around before he fell off a train.

 The incident occurred on the Kanyakumari-Mumbai Jayanti Janata Express, around 25 km from here, on June 9 when the squad caught Santosh, 18, with an expired season ticket. 

 Co-passengers accused the TTEs of pushing him off the train but railway authorities said he jumped and drowned in a lake.

 Todays order by chief judicial magistrate S. Soman came on a petition by rights activist Joemon Puthenpurackal. 

 The officer in charge of Thiruvananthapuram police station has been asked to book Khader Hussein, Ananthakrishnan, Vishnu Sankar, S. Laxmanan, B. Nachimuthu and R. Gopinath. All are from Chennais special squad.

 Three of the TTEs were roughed up by passengers while the others escaped into adjoining coaches. The passengers forced the train to a halt near Kadakkavur station.

 Santoshs decomposed body was fished out of the lake after two days. When his body was being taken in a procession to his village, protesters picketed the railway station, demanding action against the ticket examiners.

 Home minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan then asked the crime branch to probe the incident.

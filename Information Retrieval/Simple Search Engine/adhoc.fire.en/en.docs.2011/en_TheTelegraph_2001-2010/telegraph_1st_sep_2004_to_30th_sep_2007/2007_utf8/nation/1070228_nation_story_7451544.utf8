 Red lights halt Tiwari run

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

Dehra Dun, Feb. 27: As the three hundred-odd Congressmen zoomed around in their cars, red light flashing, the man on the street fumed.

 Today, the voters anger at the lalbattiwala image of the state government showed in the results as the N.D. Tiwari regime was swept out of power in Uttarakhand.

 The BJP appeared set to reclaim the hill state with a tally of 35 in the 71-member Assembly, while the Congress ended up with 21 of the 69 seats that went to polls.

 We have to take a straight look at the factors that caused our defeat. We had honoured some leaders with facilities and perks when we came to power in 2002 . But they turned over-ambitious, said a sullen Harish Rawat, the state Congress chief.

 They chose to give their personal ambition precedence over the interest of the party when election came. The result is all before us.

 Sources say there were around 300 Congress leaders who enjoyed such perks and moved around in red light-fitted cars because Tiwari wanted to keep members of all factions happy.

 But the people were not impressed. They found their voice in folk singer Narendra Singh Negi, whose album Nauchhami Narayan became an instant hit. With both hands he loots the coffers, (and) distributes red lights like peanuts, Negi sang as he lampooned Congress politicians.

 Dejected Congress leaders also blamed internal squabbles for the defeat. In fact, Rawat, who wanted to be the chief minister, seldom agreed with Tiwari, and their rivalry spilled on to the streets.

 Another factor was the presence of 32 rebels who, after being denied tickets, either turned out for the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal, Nationalist Congress Party and the Bharatiya Janashakti Party or contested as Independents.

 Today, the result of their unpatriotic act hardly surprised party leaders. The secular vote got split due to them, said state unit spokesman Surendra Agarwal.

 The BJP also gained from its Hindutva focus and its campaign that highlighted the plight of the poor in the hill districts.

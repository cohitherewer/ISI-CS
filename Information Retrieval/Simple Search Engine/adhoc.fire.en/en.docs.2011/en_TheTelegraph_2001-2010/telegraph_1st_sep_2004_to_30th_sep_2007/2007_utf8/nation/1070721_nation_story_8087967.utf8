 Minister balm for doctor family

 Firdous: Fighting on

 Bangalore, July 20: Mohammed Haneefs family today met minister of state for external affairs Ebrar Ahmed, who said Delhi was very concerned about the way the terror accused was being treated in Australia. 

 Ahmed met the doctors wife Firdous Arshiya, mother Qurrainthullain and brother Shoaib at a hotel last night when he arrived here on his way to the port city of Mangalore. 

 The minister lent a patient ear to the family and consoled a weeping Firdous, who spoke to him at length. Haneefs mother said her son was not the kind of radical the Australians were alleging him to be. He was a God-fearing person who had come up because of sheer hard work, she said.

 Ahmed told the family about Indias stand on the case. He added that Manmohan Singh had spoken to his Australian counterpart. The Prime Minister was touched by the images of Haneefs solitary confinement. 

 A Kerala MP, Ahmed had earlier played a key role in the release of three Indians kidnapped in Iraq. 

 Senior state police officers and members of central investigative agencies also met the minister to brief him on the progress in the probe relating to Kafeel Ahmed, another suspect in the failed UK car-bombing. His hard disk is being analysed by the police here.

 Police commissioner N. Achyut Rao said it would take at least a week to make sense of Ahmeds hard disk. 

 As for the letter rogatory issued by Australia for information on Haneef, Rao said it still had not reached authorities here.

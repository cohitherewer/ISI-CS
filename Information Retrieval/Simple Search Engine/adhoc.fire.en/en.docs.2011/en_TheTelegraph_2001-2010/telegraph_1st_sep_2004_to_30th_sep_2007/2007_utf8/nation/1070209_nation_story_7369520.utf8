 Cocaine blow to Fardeen

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 8: Bombay High Court today rejected Fardeen Khans plea that he be sent for detoxification and granted immunity from prosecution in a cocaine seizure case.

 The actor (in picture) is charged with attempting to buy cocaine from a drug peddler in 2001. With todays order, he will have to face a regular trial and, if found guilty, could face a 10-year sentence

 Under Section 64 (a) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, if an addict, accused of possessing drugs in small quantity for personal consumption, seeks to undergo detoxification at a recognised institute, the government can grant him immunity from prosecution.

 Fardeen had argued that he was about to buy only one gram of cocaine from Nasir Shaikh when the two were arrested on May 5, 2001, for personal consumption.

 But Justice S.C. Dharmadhikari said there was no material on record to prove that the actor was an addict and was buying a small quantity of cocaine. Nine grams of the drug was seized during Shaikh and Fardeens arrest.

 The court also upheld the prosecutors submission that no evidence was produced on Fardeens treatment for de-addiction at a government-recognised institute.

 Fardeen, who is not in India, wasnt available for comment. 

 Breather for Sanjay

 The special anti-terror court today granted Sanjay Dutt time to surrender till further orders in the Bombay blasts case even as the CBI demanded the maximum punishment of 10 years in jail for the actor.

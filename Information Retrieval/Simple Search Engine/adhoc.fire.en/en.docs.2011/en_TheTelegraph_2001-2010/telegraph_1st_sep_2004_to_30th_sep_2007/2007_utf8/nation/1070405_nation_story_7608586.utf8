 Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan at the premiere

 London, April 4: Aishwarya Rai, in a bride red sari, and her fianc, Abhishek Bachchan, who put in a surprise appearance, held hands when they attended a special screening of the film Provoked at the Empire Leicester Square in London last night.

 Ushers got very irritated with the excited behaviour of fans who would not stop snapping away at Bollywoods golden couple days before their wedding.

 Please sit down, they appealed in vain, were already very late starting the film.

 When the lights came back again at the end of the nearly two-hour-long film, onlookers were pleased to find Aishwarya still sitting there, although she had seen the movie at least twice before. 

 But Abhishek clearly had not, and must have been keen to see Aishwarya in one of her most talked about and critically acclaimed roles.

 No doubt, Abhisheks behaviour towards women is impeccable but the film provides an object lesson in how husbands should not behave.

 Aishwarya plays the role of a real-life Punjabi housewife, Kiranjit Ahluwalia, who poured petrol over her sleeping husband, Deepak, one evening and set him alight. 

 For the offence of murder, she received a mandatory life sentence but as the tale unfolds, details emerge of the 10 years of domestic violence and humiliation that Kiranjit had suffered before being provoked into striking back.

 Some of the harrowing scenes of Kiranjit being struck repeatedly by her husband probably made for uncomfo- rtable viewing for some members of the large Indian audience.

 Kiranjit herself was present, along with her two sons, one of whom broke down as he recounted how the tragedy had devastated the family.

 When the director, Jagmohun Mundhra, came on stage to introduce the key members of his cast and crew, Kiranjit offered a stark but effective message to the women in the audience: Do not suffer in silence the way I did.

 Kiranjit has just returned from a trip to India she undertook with Mundhra. 

 Also present yesterday was the actress Nandita Das, who was the star of Mundhras earlier film, Bawander, and who this time plays a social worker belonging to the Southall Black Sisters, a womens organisation which campaigned successfully for Kiranjits early release.

 In the UK, the film is getting a general release on April 6. In India, it will be released not only in English but also in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Punjabi. 

 It has also been dubbed in Chinese, Spanish and Thai, and other potential buyers such as Japan are expected to do the same.

 Earlier at a news conference, Aishwarya explained she had agreed to take on the unglamorous role of a battered British housewife because this was a story that needed to be told to a much larger audience. This was why she had from the outset also pressed for Provoked to be released in as many Indian languages as possible.

 She added: I felt an incredible sense of responsibility.

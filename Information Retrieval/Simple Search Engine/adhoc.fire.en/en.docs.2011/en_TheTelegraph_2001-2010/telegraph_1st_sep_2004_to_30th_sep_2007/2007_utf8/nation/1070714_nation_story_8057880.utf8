 Comrades edit Karat plainspeak

 Prakash Karat

 Thiruvananthapuram, July 13: Kerala CPM mouthpiece Deshabhimani has edited out an admission by party boss Prakash Karat that the newspaper accepted Rs 2 crore from a tainted businessman.

 In the July 8 issue of Peoples Democracy, the CPM weekly published from Delhi, Karat writes that party members and supporters have not appreciated the deposit of Rs 20 million from a lottery operator who faces criminal charges.

 The translated version in Deshabhimani, carried on July 3, drops this sentence. The party organ in Bengal, Ganashakti, hasnt carried the article.

 The CPM state committee, at an end-June meeting attended by Karat, had decided to return the money after a media expose landed the party in its biggest-ever financial scandal. 

 Karats tough stand against accepting tainted funds makes it unlikely that he would deliberately omit the sentence to spare the party embarrassment in Kerala. Or that he would ask Deshabhimani editor V.V. Dakshinamurthy, close to party state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan, to edit it out.

 The omission is a partial relief to the dailys general manager and Vijayan loyalist E.P. Jayarajan, under attack for taking the money.

 Also, Peoples Democracy carries the article with the double-deck headline Kerala: No Wrongdoing Will Be Tolerated, Attempts To Defame Party Will Fail while Deshabhimani omits the first part.

 It makes another change. Karat writes that the money was not a donation but came in the form of special deposits sought from advertisers at 5 per cent interest. He adds that the sum was deposited in the name of two persons on behalf of the lottery businessman.

 The two persons Karat refers to are the sons of lotto king Santeago Martin. But Deshabhimani shies away from directly referring to Martin, translating the passage as: Rs 20 million was accepted from two lottery businessmen in their capacity as advertisers.

 Martins business premises in Coimbatore were recently raided by Tamil Nadu police and he is believed to be in hiding.

 Probe order

 A special court today directed the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau to probe the allegations that Deshabhimani had accepted Rs 2 crore from a lottery dealer. 

 Enquiry commissioner and special judge K. Sasidharan Nair also ordered an inquiry into the charge that the former executive of Deshabhimani, K. Venugopal, accepted Rs 1 crore from a Kochi-based private financial firm.

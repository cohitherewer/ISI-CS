 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Class, look whos popping up

 Students will catch what jailbirds missed and their learning hours are unlikely to have a dull moment now, thanks to Rakhi Sawant.

 Denied permission to donate computers for inmates of Mumbais

 Arthur Road

 Jail recently,

 Rakhi has found

 a way to champion

 her charity-cum-PR

 cause. The

 item girl will

 now donate

 the 10 Pentium

 4 computers

 to students

 of five needy

 schools on

 the outskirts

 of Mumbai.

 But Rakhi does not want her act of charity to be forgotten and she has found a novel way to drive the point home. Every time a student switches on a PC, Rakhi, clad in a red bustier and in her signature seductive pose, will pop up on the screen.

 Apparently, Rakhi has personally approved the desktop design. Over to Operation Boiling Blackboard.

 A Cupful of biryani

 Team India, you have nothing to lose but the World Cup, a biryani and a sherwani!

 Hyderabad is cooking and stitching up a storm to greet Dravids Devils if they perform well. Some famed joints in the city are planning to prepare a special biryani and a side dish named after the players.

 Whether the biryani will eventually make it to the tables will depend on how the team performs as the Cup matches progress in the West Indies. We will name the biryani after the players only if they play well and win matches, says Mohammad Abdul Ghani, the general manager of the iconic Bawarchi.

 If Bawarchi will say it with biryani, the Mukhdoom brothers will do so with sherwani. The family, famed for its sartorial acumen, will work on sherwani valued at Rs 50,000 for each of the players if they win the Cup.

 We are also planning a special sherwani with zardosi and glass work for the best performer, says Fayaz Moinuddin, one of the Mukhdoom brothers, said. 

 Wedding for Rs 51

 A man who spent Rs 51 to marry his love launched a book on lavish wedding plans here recently.

 The tall, elderly man in a turban was picked for the occasion not because of the irony but because he was the governor of Tamil Nadu, Surjit Singh Barnala. Mine was a love marriage, a simple one, way back in 1954 with an expense of Rs 51 only Rs 51, he said, much to the amusement of the wine-and-cheese audience that had gathered at the Adyar Boat Club for the launch of The Wedding Planner (Penguin).

 Written by Reena Singh, a Delhi-based event management consultant, the book deals with various aspects of wedding from drawing up the first plan to dreaming up the exotic honeymoon with the more mundane formalities of obtaining marriage certificates thrown in between. 

 Water meters

 Political parties have launched a campaign against setting up of water meters in Vijayawada town.

 Led by the Telugu Desam, the parties have formed a committee to conduct a door-to-door drive to explain the dangerous consequences of water meters. In the past, political parties in Andhra Pradesh, including the Congress, have opposed setting up of electricity meters in rural areas.

 Committee leaders alleged that the government was trying to collect charges for water, which is natures gift, and that the move to install water meters was a part of World Bank conditions for sanction of loans.

 But municipal commissioner Gulzar says he has the governments support to go ahead with the plan.

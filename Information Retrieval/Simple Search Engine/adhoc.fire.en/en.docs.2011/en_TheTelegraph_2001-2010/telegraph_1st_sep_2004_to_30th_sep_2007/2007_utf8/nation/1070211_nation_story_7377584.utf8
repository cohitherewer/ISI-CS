 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Girls locked in dads hell-hole

 Hyderabad: A 32-year-old father had locked up his two teenage daughters in a room for the past two months.

 Asma and Najma, both 16, had to eat, live, sleep and relieve themselves in the same room of their shabby tin-roofed tenement. Neighbours got a whiff of foul play from the stink near their house at Bhagat Singh Colony on the outskirts of Hyderabad and called police.

 When brought out, the sisters were in a daze and almost starving. The father, Anwar Miyan, has been booked under the domestic violence act and his daughters have been sent to a residential school.

 After the death of his wife, Anwar Miyan, a daily wager, became cynical, said a police inspector.

 V-Day? Senas watching

 Mumbai: Its that time of the year again when young lovers need to watch out for not only prying parents, but Mumbais self-appointed moral police.

 The Shiv Sainiks are whetting their swords as couples make plans for Valentines Day.

 A Sena tradition now, they are out to ensure theres no romancing on February 14. The youth wing of the Sena has been asked to tell students in colleges to refrain from celebrating this western concept. We have also advised shopowners not to sell Valentines Day goods, says a Sainik. 

 But the students think wars not quite fair on a day for love.

 I think its preposterous to see the Shiv Sena going berserk about this celebration. What westernisation are they talking about? Dont they celebrate Mothers Day? Dont they cut cakes on their birthdays? If they do, they desperately need to know that these are western concepts as well, fumes Riya Anandwala, a third-year student of journalism at the National College.

 If they are so patriotic (as they say) and dont believe in such expressions of love, then tell them to wear only khadi. They are a bunch of hypocrites.

 Friends wage cancer war

 Mumbai: Friends, they say are for life 23-year-old Rajiv N. may vouch for it.

 A first-year student of South Indian Educational Society College, Rajiv was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, a rare variety of cancer, three years ago. 

 His parents reduced themselves to paupers, spending over Rs 1 crore for the treatment. But the cancer kept coming back, each time worse than before. 

 In the ceaseless battle against the disease, Rajivs friends pitched in the way only they could organising a rock band competition to drum up support and raise money. 

 Rajiv, who is now undergoing treatment in the US, needs Rs 25 lakh more. 

 His father, Narayan Bhattarajan, works for Godrej. Mother Mallika, who was with HSBC, took voluntary retirement after Rajiv was diagnosed with the disease.

 Everything else might fail, but not their hope.

 Munna clone

 Hyderabad: Telugu hero Chiranjeevi, who starred in Shankar Dada MBBS, a Munnabhai rip-off, is into Gandhigiri, too. Directed by choreographer Prabhu Deva, the shooting for Shankar Dada Zindabad has begun in Hyderabad and guess what made the opening shot. The star lip-syncing on a yellow motorcycle with his mate sitting in a carriage attached to the two-wheeler.

 If Munnabhai has Circuit as his sidekick, Shankar Dada has ATM.

 The street lingo of Mumbai is replaced by the Telengana slant here.

 Poor second! That is going to be the verdict from those who do not count themselves among Chiranjeevi fans.

Bangalore: If you are planning a trip to Bangalore, dont go on Monday. A dawn-to-dusk bandh over the Cauvery water-sharing verdict will paralyse the city and the delta areas of Mandya, Mysore, Hassan and Chamarajamnagar. Police will deploy additional forces to keep mischief-makers at bay.

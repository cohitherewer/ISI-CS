 Srinagar, April 21: Kashmir is coming to Calcutta to woo jittery tourists back.

 A series of militant attacks last year that left a dozen dead, including seven Bengalis, has led to a slump in the tourist inflow from the state.

 Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad is now heading to Calcutta on a special mission to allay peoples fears and give them confidence to visit his state. His government is organising a series of roadshows. 

 The CM is scheduled to leave for Calcutta in the first week of June where we are jointly organising a Kashmir show with the West Bengal government, tourism director Farooq Ahmad Shah said.

 We are expecting the presence of Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and other dignitaries from the state in the show. We took up the issue with visiting Bengal MP Mohammad Salim this week and there has been good progress on that. 

 The Valley is cashing in on the rich relationship Kashmiris share with Bengalis. A lot of our people go to that state to sell shawls and other handicraft items, and the movement of people between the two states has never stopped, Shah said.

 The tourist count slid to around 4.5 lakh in 2006, two lakh less than the preceding year, and the terror attacks on the eve of the roundtable conference kept Bengalis away.

 Tourists from Bengal are crucial for the survival of our tourism industry and we are trying hard to restore their faith in us. After last years unfortunate incidents, they have almost stopped coming, said Habib-Ullah Mir of the Kashmir Hoteliers and Restaurant Owners Association. 

 We recently approached our CM and asked him to personally accompany us to get them back and he has agreed to do so, he added.

 The Kashmir government and people in the tourism trade, however, are hopeful the Bengalis will return.

 Mir said a roadshow was held in Calcutta in January, where the response was good. Bengali tourists come to Kashmir all through the year, but during Durga Puja there are expectations of a better inflow. We are preparing in advance to seize that opportunity, he said.

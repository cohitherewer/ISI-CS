 Oxford entrance tests to get tougher

 AMIT ROY 

 Best of brightest

 London, March 25: Oxford University intends applying a whole raft of new entrance tests to identify the brightest pupils from the increasing numbers who now achieve the top A grade in their Advanced (A)-level school leaving finals. 

 But head teachers as well as the university itself admit this will put even more pressure on students who dream of winning a place at Oxford.

 The problem for Oxford and for Cambridge is that the proportion of school leavers who get straight A-grades in their finals has been steadily going up over the years. If everyone is doing brilliantly, how do you choose the best? 

 The vast majority of university hopefuls takes three or four A-level subjects. A typical combination might be mathematics, advanced mathematics, physics and chemistry for those hoping to study science at university. 

 Those hoping to pursue arts might go for English, French, geography and art. 

 Once, only the brightest got straight A-grades in all their subjects and, more or less, walked into Oxbridge, assuming the face-to-face interview with their would-be tutors at their first-choice college wasnt a disaster. 

 Based on predictions of how well a student would perform at A-level, colleges made conditional offers. Thus, a bright student might be made a conditional offer of 2 Bs to get into, say, Christ Church, when the tutor would be reasonably confident the candidate would almost certainly get all As. 

 By 1986, the proportion of students who got three grade As had reached 40 per cent. Now, any Oxbridge hopeful who does not achieve all As would probably feel like a failure. Even the good non-Oxbridge universities now expect their candidates to get straight As when they apply for such sought-after subjects as, say, English at Bristol University this is what Jemima Goldsmith, then 21, was studying when she met her future 42-year-old husband, Imran Khan (she ditched her course to marry him but returned later to finish her degree). 

 Oxford has now decided that it needs its own entrance tests to weed out candidates who swot hard enough to get the top grades at A-level but who, in the opinion of dons, are not quite good enough for the university. 

 Since conditional offers are made even before students sit their A-level examinations, dons almost have to play God, but Oxford seems determined to reduce the number of candidates summoned for interview based on the entrance tests.

 Not everyone is happy. Head teachers and top private schools attacked the reforms, which they argued would pile more pressure on schools and students.

 Mike Nicholson, Oxfords admissions director, said: The ability to achieve three grade As is no longer the end point in the admissions process. The potential to achieve three grade As will allow them to enter the race for a place. 

 It is unlikely the aptitude tests will help students of Asian origin, apart possibly from the Chinese. Under parental pressure, Indian children do well in exams but experience has shown they are not necessarily good at lateral or independent thinking. 

 Nicholson said the university was introducing aptitude tests for mathematics, computer sciences, English and probably PPE (philosophy, politics and economics), the subject Benazir Bhutto read. 

 Candidates already sit entrance tests in history, law and medicine. 

 Nicholson acknowledged that there were concerns that the extra tests would put more pressure on schools and teenagers. 

 I wouldnt necessarily disagree, he said. However, we are looking at ways to identify potential. With a student who looks a bit weak on all the other criteria, we will look at the test result. If the result confirms that, then they would probably not be shortlisted. Ultimately we will reduce the number of interviews. 

 Representing head teachers, John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, condemned Oxfords decision to introduce more tests. 

 He said: We already have far too many examinations in this country, creating huge pressure for young people of all abilities. 

 The elite private schools also criticised the huge proliferation of admissions tests and Oxfords plans to cut back on interviews. 

 Geoff Lucas, secretary of the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference of top independent schools, said Oxfords decision was an inevitable result of the governments failure to reform the A-level examination system. 

 Its understandable, totally predictable and deeply regrettable, he said.

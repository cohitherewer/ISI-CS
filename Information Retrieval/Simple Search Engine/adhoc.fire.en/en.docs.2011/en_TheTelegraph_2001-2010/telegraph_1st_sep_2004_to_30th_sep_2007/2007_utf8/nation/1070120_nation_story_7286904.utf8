 STAR stars put in papers 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan 19: The top honchos of STAR TV India Peter Mukherjea and Samir Nair are believed to have put in their papers. 

 The departure of the duo follows last weeks sudden exit of Michelle Guthrie who was replaced by Paul Aiello as chief executive officer of STAR TV Hong Kong. 

 Guthrie was with STAR for six years and was pitchforked into the CEOs job in November 2003, replacing Jamesh Murdoch who had moved to head BSkyB in the UK. 

 When Guthrie left, there was speculation that Mukherjea and Nair would also leave but it was immediately squelched by them. 

 When the news first hit the media, Nair had said he was not planning to leave as he was busy with the launch of the next edition of Kaun Banega Crorepati with Shah Rukh Khan as the new anchor. 

 While Nair is said to be joining NDTV, Mukherjea is believed to be joining hands with Mukesh Ambani to launch new channels. 

 According to the grapevine, Mukherjea could flag off the venture on his own initially or as a joint venture to be brought under the Reliance umbrella at a later date. 

 In March last year, STAR India was split into two separate divisionsSTAR Group India and STAR Entertainment India. Earlier, Mukerjea, who was chief executive officer of STAR India, was named the chief executive of STAR Group India, while Nair, who was chief operating officer of STAR India, was made the chief executive of STAR Entertainment India. 

 Aiello, who had a fairly long stint with Morgan Stanley, joined STAR last year and was responsible for developing strategic and business directions.

 Guthrie is credited with spearheading the successful foray into India and China.

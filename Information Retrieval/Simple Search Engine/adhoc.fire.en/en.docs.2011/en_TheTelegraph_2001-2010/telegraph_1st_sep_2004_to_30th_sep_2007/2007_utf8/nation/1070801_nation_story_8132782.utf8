 Hope hype and sucker punch 

 Sanjay shock after friends acquittal for good behaviour raises expectations

 Mumbai, July 31: As the days first sentence was delivered, Sanjay Dutt smiled and patted friend Russi Mulla.

 Outside, TV channels were going ballistic and the film stars fans sighing in relief.

 Mulla, charged under the Arms Act like Sanjay, was walking free for good behaviour and there was no way the court could now differentiate in the actors case, the TV anchors were saying.

 Most of their array of experts agreed. One was 99 per cent certain that Sanjay, too, would get probation. 99.99 per cent, said another.

 A lawyer who suggested that judge Pramod Kode had the right to serve up a different sentence was met with impatience about technical points.

 An unhappy few grumbled about a dark day when a celebrity was being luckier than lesser beings, and some in the courtroom were whispering about political pressure. But everybody agreed on what the outcome would be.

 Till the sucker punch landed.

 When the judge called out Sanjays name, the actors face was shining with expectation. Seconds later, he looked as if he couldnt believe his ears.

 Kode had provided a hint, though, as he let Mulla off against a payment of Rs 1 lakh and a like surety.

 The 76-year-old spare parts trader, convicted of illegally possessing a 9mm pistol and trying to destroy it, had acted under Sanjays influence and faced no past charges, the judge said.

 A few minutes later, Kode was telling Sanjay he hadnt merely committed a crime but got three others to do so, showing a high element of criminality.

 As the actor broke down and tears ran down his face, his friend Yusuf Nulwalla joined his hands in prayer, hoping for a lesser term. He got five years rigorous imprisonment plus a fine of Rs 25,000 for his role in aiding Sanjay get rid of an AK-56 rifle.

 Kersi Adajania, who was given the rifle by Nulwalla and had tried to destroy it in his factory, got two years rigorous imprisonment and a Rs 25,000 fine. It was his son who broke down this time.

 Its the character

 Kode said a convicts character was crucial to a probation plea, and that Sanjay kept bad company. He was close to gangster Anees Ibrahim and had attended a party thrown by underworld don Dawood Ibrahim in Dubai.

 He said the affidavits by Bollywood personalities such as Dilip Kumar in Sanjays support were of no use since there was evidence against the actor.

 The judge added that Sanjays acquisition of the AK-56 and 9mm pistol apparently to defend his family during the January 1993 riots in Mumbai could not be termed noble as it was against the law.

 I must say (that) for every citizen, laws of the nation shall be respected. If you dont, I dont expect you to be called a moral person.

 Kode accepted that the crimes by the actor and his friends were not anti-social, ghastly, inhuman, immoral or pre-planned, but they were still an eminently dangerous act since the weapons Sanjay kept were capable of mass destruction.

 Bail blow

 When Sanjays counsel Satish Maneshinde made a last- ditch appeal for a delayed surrender, arguing that his clients conduct had been excellent, Kode turned towards special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam.

 I appreciate his conduct but a person sentenced to more than three years cannot be granted an extension of bail, Nikam said.

 On his way out of the court, the actor shook hands with the prosecutor and said: Thank you, sir.

 The court, however, accepted the movie stars plea that he be lodged in the Arthur Road Jail here, and ordered a separate cell for him. 

 When the actor said he feared for Nulwallas safety, Kode said he, too, would have his own cell at the central Mumbai prison. 

 On August 2, Kode will hear another application by Sanjay not to be moved out of the Arthur Road Jail at any time during his term.

 Kode gave the star a last concession, allowing him to meet his family and close friends and speak to his daughter Trishala who lives in the US.

 Vehicles feel price pinch

 Cess trouble

 New Delhi, March 1: Indians waiting for the budget to drive down prices before driving out of the showroom in their dream car were in for an unpleasant surprise: led by Maruti, almost all auto companies have raised prices.

 Luxury carmaker Skoda was the only exception it is cutting up to Rs 24,000 on its models. 

 For the rest, the 1 per cent education cess imposed yesterday was too much to digest even the cut in peak import duty did not help. 

 We have decided to pass on the impact of the education cess to customers, ranging from Rs 500 on an Indica to Rs 1,200 on a Safari, a Tata Motors official said today. 

 Hyundai said it would follow suit, but was still working out the quantum of the rise. Due to a 1 per cent increase in education cess in the Union budget, Hyundai cars would cost more to the end-consumer, Hyundai Motors India managing director H.S. Lheem said. The hike will come into effect once the company clears all existing bookings, he said.

 Like the consumers, the carmakers, too, had been waiting for the budget, looking for concessions an excise duty cut and phasing out of the central sales tax topped the list they could pass on. 

 Maruti, which was the first to announce a price rise yesterday, is even keeping a two-week window open for customers who had deferred purchases till after the budget. It is holding the price rise till March 15 to spare them the extra pinch if they buy now. 

 Rajeev Chaba, president and managing director, General Motors India, said: The budget has largely not met the demand of the industry. On top of it, a 1 per cent cess has been imposed. Companies will have to pass on the burden.

 Prices across all its models from hatchback Chevrolet Uva to luxury sedan Chevrolet Optra went up today. The increase in prices will be between Rs 600 and Rs 1,500, a senior company official said.

 The steepest increase announced was for the Honda CRV, which became costlier by Rs 10,000. We are not touching the prices of our sedans City, Civic and Accord as the import duty cut on components more or less balances out the education cess burden, Honda senior general manager Jnaneswar Sen said.

 Ford, too, is considering raising prices of Fiesta and Ikon. For Endeavour, they will study the impact of the duty cut.

 Skoda alone was swimming against the tide. We have been reviewing the price implications with the recent budget impact. A reduction up to Rs 24,000 is expected across various models with effect from March 1, managing director Karsten Bogun said.

 The company today reported a marginal dip in sales during February, at 644 units as against 652 units in the same month last year.

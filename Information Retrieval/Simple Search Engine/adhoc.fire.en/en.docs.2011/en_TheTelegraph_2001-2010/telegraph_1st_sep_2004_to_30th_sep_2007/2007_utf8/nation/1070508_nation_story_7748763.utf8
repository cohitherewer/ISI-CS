 Court heat on Dawood sister

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 7: A sessions court today pulled up police for failing to arrest Dawood Ibrahims sister Hasina Parkar on charges of cheating and intimidation and told them to put her behind bars by May 16.

 Hearing an anticipatory bail plea by co-accused Chandresh Shah, additional sessions judge A.V. Nirgude turned his ire on a crime branch official when he said a warrant was yet to be issued against Parkar. 

 The judge then directed the police to arrest her before May 16, when the case will be heard next.

 Earlier, Nirgude asked prosecutor R.V. Kini why the dons sister was roaming free.Without naming Parkar, Kini said: Whenever we make an attempt (to arrest someone), we get a call from higher-ups. 

 Kini later requested the court not to put his comments on record, and the court assured him that they would be deleted.

 The crime branch had lodged an FIR against Parkar and a group of seven developers and agents for allegedly extorting money from another developer, Vinod Avlani, last month. 

 Avlani lodged a complaint saying builders Krishna Milan and Sandeep Shukla had borrowed Rs 1 crore from him for funding a slum rehabilitation project. 

 The project was a non-starter, but they did not return Rs 30 lakh of the amount they had borrowed, he said. He alleged that Parkar had mediated the deal at her Nagpada residence.

 Nirgude today reiterated that an extortion case could not be made out against Parkar and the others. He said the case should be treated as one of cheating and criminal intimidation.

 The judge had made the observation at the previous hearing as well. 

 Nirgude had said there was no evidence of extortion against Parkar if the complainant had received Rs 70 lakh of the Rs 1 crore he had lent. 

 He had directed the crime branch to lodge a case of cheating and criminal intimidation instead.

 Cousins killed on way home

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: Fifteen hours after two teenaged schoolboys were reported missing, Delhi police found their bodies in a wooded area, sparking fears that extortion rackets in western Uttar Pradesh could be spilling over into the capital.

 The police have arrested four men who they believe kidnapped the cousins for ransom but ended up killing them in panic once they realised the cops were on their trail. The boys were kidnapped yesterday as they were returning from school. The bodies were found today, around daybreak, by a search party, deputy commissioner (north-east) Devesh Srivastava said.

 Fourteen-year-old Chetan Swaroop and Sahil Goyal, 13, students of east Delhis Sarvodaya Modern Boys School were lured into tasting ice-cream lollies laced with sedatives while walking back home, police said.

 Their families started receiving ransom calls around 4.30 pm, about two hours after the boys are believed to have been kidnapped. The kidnappers wanted Rs 4 lakh for each boy to be deposited at a location some five kilometres away (in east Delhi), said an officer.

 By then, however, the families had informed the cops and their phones were being tapped. Although Srivastava claimed the police arrested the four after the bodies were found, sources told The Telegraph the men themselves led the police to the place in Delhis ridge area where the bodies had been dumped.

 Vijendra Singh, 18, Mohammad Nadim, 18, Shakeel, 20, and Vinod Kumar, 22, were arrested last night, and took us to the bodies early this morning, said an official.

 Last year, Adobe India CEO Naresh Guptas three-year-old son Anant was kidnapped but was released after paying Rs 50 lakh as ransom.

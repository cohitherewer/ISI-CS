The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Mama, teach the teacher a lesson

 Delhi: Faith 

 in her childrens

 academic

 capabilities

 is something

 Rekha Kohli

 has in plenty.

 Unhappy with

 her childrens

 performance

 at school,

 Kohli, an

 east Delhi

 resident,

 has used

 the Right

 to Information

 Act to inspect

 service

 files of

 their teachers. 

 The mother of two also wants to attend some classes with her children to inspect the work of teachers as they teach. 

 In her application, Kohli says she has no doubt about her childrens abilities if they are doing poorly at school, the teachers must be responsible. 

 The two schools the Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Nand Nagri, where her daughter studies, and the Government Boys Senior Secondary School her son attends are none too pleased. Neither is the Delhi governments directorate of education. The government and the schools refused to give information. 

 he Central Information Commission has reprimanded the Delhi government. But it has also pointed out the limitations of the act to the mother: she can inspect files, but there is no provision for her to attend classes.

 Cleaning glasses for a party

 Mumbai: Lets

 go party tonight,

 goes the chart-topper.

 And thats

 what two Mumbai

 teens wanted

 to do since

 they heard

 the KANK song.

 Premchan Kumawat, 17, and Yogesh Papnoi, 14, saw a newspaper ad where a pub promised a good time for Rs 2,000. They tried to borrow from friends but there wasnt any luck there. 

 Thats when they decided to test Surat, which could be a cheaper party destination. But they didnt make the cut there either.

 On Wednesday, Kumawat called up a classmate and asked for Rs 2,000 saying he wanted to party, a police officer said. The girl refused.

 The two then worked at a fruit juice stall in Andheri to raise money for a party. 

 But someone tipped off their school. When the police arrived, the boys were cleaning glasses.

 Queen of jewels

 Hayderbad: You

 can take your

 pick on whether

 Angelina Jolie

 or Catherine

 Zeta Jones

 will look

 more resplendent

 in the Nizams

 ruby-and-diamond

 choker, but

 Manolya Onur

 wouldnt

 mind either

 of them. 

 The ex-wife of the VIIIth Nizam says an American producer wants to make a film on her. And both Mrs Brad Pitt and Mrs Michael Douglas would fit the bill. 

 She is in the city with daughter Niloufer because Nizam Mukaram Jah has moved the high court against a family courts cool Rs 15-crore divorce settlement. The high court has granted her an interim relief Rs 2 crore and $10,000. 

 The mother and daughter are a hit in the party circuit. At Jubilee Hills and Banjara Hills, they match the silk with the stones gifted by the Nizam in the good ol days. 

 Saris make me feel young, she says. 

 SMS cop

 Chennai:

 They 

 have netted

 many a cyber

 crook, but

 this proved

 to be their

 toughest chase.

 A set of cyber

 cops was recently

 asked to snoop

 on their colleague

 who was allegedly

 sending indecent

 messages to

 a lady officer. 

 The woman, who works as a computer operator at the suburban Selaiyur police station, complained to police commissioner Lathika Saran about inspector Selvakumar, saying he sent her obscene SMSes from a few desks away. 

 The commissioner put the cyber sleuths on the job. A case has been registered and Selvakumar has been suspended. Last heard, the SMSing cop has gone on medical leave.

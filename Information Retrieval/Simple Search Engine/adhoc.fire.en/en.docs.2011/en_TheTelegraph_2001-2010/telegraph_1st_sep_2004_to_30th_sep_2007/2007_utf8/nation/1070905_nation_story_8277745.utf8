The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Model in hospital

 New Delhi, Sept. 4 (PTI): Gitanjali Nagpal, the former model found asking for money on the streets of the capital, has been admitted to Vimhans Hospital.

 Gitanjali, under the care of the Delhi Commission for Women, was admitted late last night after permission from the metropolitan magistrate.

 She is supposed to present herself before the court tomorrow, but it is unlikely that she would be able to do so given her state of health. So the commission will seek time for her appearance, commission chairperson Barkha Singh said.

 Vimhans doctors yesterday said she was suffering from fear psychosis.

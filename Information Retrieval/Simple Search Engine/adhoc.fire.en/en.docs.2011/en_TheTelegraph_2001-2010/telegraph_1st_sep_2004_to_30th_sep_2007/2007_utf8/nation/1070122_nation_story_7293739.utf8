 Sari snares pious thief

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Jan. 21:Shakila Bee is a god-fearing gold-snatcher. But she chose the wrong time to appease the goddess.

 The 22-year-old, who stalked gullible women at shrines in Andhra Pradesh, was caught last Wednesday after she had just walked into the Kanakadurga temple in Vijayawada dressed as a Hindu and offered a sari that cost Rs 5,000 to the local deity.

 What gave her away was that amavasya was two days away. No Hindu woman would make such an offering before new moon day, said a priest at the temple who alerted the sleuths on the lookout for the pious thief.

 I wish I had consulted some of my friends about amavasya, a crestfallen Shakila, who had been earlier sentenced twice for petty offences, told the police after her arrest.

 The resident of Krishna district had been on the wanted list for the last three years. She would befriend women, who wore gold ornaments to temples, and win their confidence with her pious looks and glib talk. 

 Invited to their house, she struck at the slightest opportunity, said Vijayawada city police commissioner C.V. Anand. The total worth of the stolen gold ornaments came to about Rs 10 lakh.

 Asked why she offered saris at temples, Shakila said though she came from a poor Muslim family, she had been brought up in a Hindu society in Vyuuru town of Vijayawada district.I became a thief because of my familys economic condition, but I am a god-fearing person, she added. By offering saris, she said, she hoped to appease the god in whose temple she would befriend her victims.

 Hero meets star, on date after date

 Jodhpur, Aug. 29: Dholaram Bishnoi finds his fate intrinsically tied to Salman Khans.

 A hero of sorts in his village Khejarli, Dholaram is involved in eight cases against hunters. His first case in which he caught a group cooking the meat of a deer and attacked them seems to be always listed on the same day as the actors.

 Ironically, Salman who is behind bars for killing a chinkara is one of the most hated figures in the Bishnoi community. 

 My wife says that I only go to see Salman Khan and not for the hearing, Dholaram says with a smile.

 Today, too, while a Rajasthan High Court judge refused to hear the stars plea, the farmer was waiting outside for his turn.

 I have been beaten up with lathis many times, he says. The police get so excited when his case comes up. The problem is that because of his case, mine often gets deferred.

 While Salmans hunting habits seem to have grabbed eyeballs across the country, in Khejarli, a 45-minute drive from Jodhpur, such incidents are quite common. The problem is, like in the case of Salman, witnesses often get tired of going to court year after year. In our area, at least one person gets killed every year trying to save animals, says Sukhram Bishnoi, a retired schoolteacher.

 The Bishnois are fiercely protective about their environment. Acquainted with every section of Indian wildlife laws, they will go to any lengths to save wildlife, as Salman would have learnt the hard way. 

 We started the original Chipko movement about 250 years ago. Over 300 people died protecting trees, Sukhram says proudly.

 This is a legend villagers of Khejarli never seem to tire of repeating. The Maharaja of Jodhpur, Abhay Singh, was building a fort and needed lime kilns. The authorities wanted to cut down Khejadi trees as they are supposed to be the best to bake lime. My ancestors refused to let it happen, Sukhram says. 

 The Bishnois of this village, mostly farmers, remain committed to the green cause. It doesnt matter if the deer eat our crops. We have to protect them, says Dholaram. 

 The irony doesnt end there. The Bishnois, most of whom havent seen a single film in their life, are glued to the screen when Hum Saath Saath Hain is aired. But it is not for Salman, who had made a chinkara his game while shooting for this film in 1998.

 There is one scene in the film in which M.L. Bishnoi does kanyadaan. They may have cut it, but that is the only reason why we watch the film, says Sukhram.

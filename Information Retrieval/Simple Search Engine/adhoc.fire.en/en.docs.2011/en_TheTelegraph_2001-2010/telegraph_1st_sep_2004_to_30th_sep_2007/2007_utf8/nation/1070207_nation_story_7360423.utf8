 Indian scientists skip global climate meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: Not a single climate change scientist represented India at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change meeting in Paris last week that drew over 300 delegates from 113 countries, IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri said today.

 The IPCC had issued a summary of its fourth assessment report on the future of the planet at the meeting, predicting higher temperatures and adverse climate for centuries to come. At least five Indian scientists had served as scientific authors in fashioning the report.

 But only a senior diplomat from the Indian embassy in Paris represented India at the meeting, Pachauri said. There was no one from the ministry of environment and forests the agency responsible for coordinating climate change activity. 

 In sharp contrast, China sent 10 specialists, Pachauri said.

 But sources said the ministry of environment and forests had recommended that two senior climate change scientists both from government institutions should represent India at the meeting.

 One of the scientists confirmed that both had received letters from the ministry, but could not go because no one seemed to know who was going to pay for the trip.

 Its a shame that India could not be adequately represented, the scientist said. We need to be a part of the global dialogue on climate change.

 Its unfortunate, but for many policy makers in India, global warming is still a long-term issue, said a senior atmospheric scientist in an academic institution.

 Ideally, the science component of climate change should have been handled by the ministry of earth sciences or ministry of science and technology, the scientist said. But its been with environment for historical reasons.

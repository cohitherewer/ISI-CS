 Karnataka row 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 29: The BJP today sought to deflect attention from the Karnataka crisis by making fun of Congress prince Rahul Gandhi.

 The party, under media glare following reports of internal struggle in the southern state, said extension of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme to the whole country was a graduation gift to Rahul, who was appointed a general secretary earlier this week.

 BJP general secretary Ananth Kumar and Karnataka deputy chief minister B.S. Yediyurappa are both said to be nursing ambitions of becoming chief minister. 

 BJP spokesman Ravi Shankar Prasad dismissed the reports of a power struggle and said Yediyurappa was the only chief ministerial candidate. 

 The timing of a police complaint filed by a BJP minister, B. Sriramulu, against chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy has also raised eyebrows.

 Sriramulu, who held the tourism portfolio, resigned today as part of a compromise formula to placate the Janata Dal (Secular), the BJPs coalition partner in the state. 

 The BJP leader had alleged that the chief minister was behind a conspiracy to eliminate him. The complaint had angered Dal (S) chief H.D. Deve Gowda, who warned the BJP that the power transfer on October 3 would not be smooth.

 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Maran effect tells on phone service

 Phone lines in Chennai arent buzzing like they did a few months ago. Some say it is because Dayanidhi Maran isnt in charge.

 That might not be a joke, after all. Since the communications minister lost his job to the DMK family feud, life for BSNL customers hasnt been easy. 

 Lines are going dead (even after payments), complaints are going unattended and bills arent reaching on time. Harried subscribers are often seen queuing up to collect duplicate bills (many are hardly legible).

 Insiders say one of the culprits is a courier firm that recently bagged a deal to deliver bills. The job was earlier with the Department of Posts part of the ministry that Maran headed.

 The company has messed up in the very first month, but BSNL insiders say it should be given a month more to get its act together.

 But what about customers whose phones are being snapped because bills arent being delivered on time? May be, they should try and get Maran back.

 College barons in tax loop

 After real estate barons, its the turn of the education czars of Hyderabad to feel the heat.

 Dozens of institutions, often promoted by corporate entities, have sprung up in Hyderabad with branches across the state after the Telugu Desam Party government opened up the education sector to private players. 

 But, as they rake in the moolah, many have been playing truant with the taxman. Mumtasir Ahmed, director-general (investigation) of income tax in Andhra Pradesh, says a probe has been launched into institutions that collect exorbitant fees and donations. Some were even found to be claiming exemptions on false grounds or flimsy pretexts.

 Searches conducted in 2006-07 on nearly 48 such institutions threw up undisclosed income of Rs 334.45 crore. This year, the figure could touch Rs 500 crore.

 Some private professional colleges take donations of Rs 45 lakh for a seat. 

 Abductor cops caught

 Kidnappers had a field day in Hyderabad last week. That is nothing unusual. But one gang didnt turn out to be kidnappers, after all. It had policemen on a private mission.

 Two sons of an oil merchant were whisked away, and the ransom demand was Rs 1.98 crore. When city police raided an apartment in search of the hostages, they were stunned to find two constables from a police station in Guntur. The duo allegedly carried out the job to recover the dues the oil merchant owed a seed supplier. The policemen were promptly taken into custody.

 In another incident, three persons were spirited away by men in three Sumos in a kidnapping straight out of a crime thriller. The same day, a father and a son were taken away by the hired goons who also ransacked their home. City police commissioner Balwinder Singh has formed special teams to fight the menace. 

 On smooth rails

 Like the civic bodies working to ensure Mumbaikars have a hassle-free monsoon, the railways are ready with their plans to fight the downpour and the deluge.

 Tracks have been cleaned, more pumps installed along the rails and new drains laid.

 Western Railway will install 32 high-pressure pumps at key locations at a cost of Rs 29 lakh. About 30 km of drains have been made along the route to prevent water logging. 

 The stretch between Mumbai Central and Borivali stations has been raised to keep water from gushing on to the tracks. 

 Railway authorities say they have also cleaned culverts and old drains.

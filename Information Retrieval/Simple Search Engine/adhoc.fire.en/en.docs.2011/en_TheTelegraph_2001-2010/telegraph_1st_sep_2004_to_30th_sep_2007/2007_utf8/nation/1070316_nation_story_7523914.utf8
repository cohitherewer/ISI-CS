 Model governor deals blow without parallel

 Calcutta, March 15: Not fire-breathing Mamata Banerjee, but quiet and constitutionally correct governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi may have hit Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee the hardest for the Nandigram tragedy. 

 Without blame-fixing, as he put it in his statement, Gandhi put the government in the dock in no uncertain terms.

 In doing so, Gandhi became the first governor of Bengal in 30 years of the Left Fronts rule to indict the government within constitutional norms. 

 Not taking notice of the events in Nandigram would have been constitutionally improper and politically incorrect for any governor. But Gandhi went one step further when he questioned the wisdom of the governments action, sticking to constitutional protocol.

 Usually a governor would seek reports from the state government before sending his own to the Union home ministry. This time, Gandhi issued a statement on his own even before he formally heard the chief ministers version. Nor did he wait for the statement that Bhattacharjee was to make on the Nandigram incident in the Assembly.

 Gandhis action was, however, different from earlier cases when Bengal governors were critical of the state government on various issues. 

 The worst case of the governor-government row happened during A.P. Sharmas tenure at Raj Bhavan in 1983-84. The difference came out in the open over Sharmas choice of Santosh Bhattacharya as vice-chancellor of Calcutta University, overruling two Front nominees. 

 But Sharma, a former leader of Congress trade arm Intuc, did not quite forget his political post when he joined issue with the then Jyoti Basu government.

 The other governor, who rubbed Basu the wrong way, especially on the issue of illegal migration of Bangladeshis into the state, was T.V. Rajeswar, currently the governor of Uttar Pradesh. Basu once dismissively referred to Rajeswars police background he belonged to the IPS.

 It is generally agreed in political circles that Gandhi has strictly adhered to his constitutional role. Coming from such a governor, his censure of the government is unprecedented in the Lefts long rule.

 The chief minister said he has high regards for the governor and claimed that he had a correspondence with Gandhi on the Nandigram issue. He added that the copy of the report, which is being despatched to the Centre, was sent to him. Gandhi also spoke to him before he visited the Tamluk hospital. 

 Several front leaders also appreciated Gandhi for taking a bold stand vis-a-vis the Nandigram issue.

 The governor has done his bit by condemning yesterdays massacre in Nandigram through a public statement, said senior RSP leader and PWD minister Kshiti Goswami.

 Forward Bloc leader and agriculture minister Naren De echoed Goswami and said Gandhi had acted in accordance with constitutional norms. 

 The Opposition parties spoke highly about the governor. Gandhi has rightly censured the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government for the genocide in Nandigram, said former Bengal Congress chief Somen Mitra.

 Partha Chatterjee, Trinamul Congress MLA and leader of the Opposition, too, praised the governor. He recounted that Gandhi had thrice visited Mamata Banerjees camp at Esplanade where she was on fast for 26 days in December.

 The only discordant note was sounded by state transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. I have doubts if the governor has the constitutional authority to issue a public statement on the working of the government, he said. 

 Gandhi today paid a visit to the Tamluk district hospital to enquire about the condition of the injured undergoing treatment there. He assured them of proper medical care and assistance.

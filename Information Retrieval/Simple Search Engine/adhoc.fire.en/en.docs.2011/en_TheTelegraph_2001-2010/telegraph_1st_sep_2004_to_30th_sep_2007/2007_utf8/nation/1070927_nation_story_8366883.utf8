 Attacked doctor still critical 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: Police today began investigating whether possible family tension was behind the attempted rape and murder of a lady doctor in her hostel room at a government hospital on Friday night. 

 The 26-year-old doctor is barely alive and has been placed on a ventilator at Balaji Hospital, police sources said.

 The door of the victims hostel room had not been forced open. That automatically makes us suspect that the culprit was known to the victim, a police officer said. 

 One of the victims sisters and her husband found the doctor unconscious and complained to the police. 

 We are not suspecting anyone in particular. But we are investigating if there had been any financial disagreement in the family, the officer said.

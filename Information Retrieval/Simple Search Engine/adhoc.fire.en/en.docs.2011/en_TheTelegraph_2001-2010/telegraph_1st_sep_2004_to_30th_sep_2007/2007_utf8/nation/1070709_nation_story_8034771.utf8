 Ambulance to evict squatter

 Ghulab Abdul Nahim had been holding on to his government quarters long after he retired. Several notices asking him vacate didnt work. Finally, an ambulance did the trick.

 Nahim had claimed all these years that he couldnt leave the house because his mother was too ill to move. But when the ambulance pulled up, the ailing lady sat up and told officers of the eviction squad she was fit.

 Nahims case highlights the problem that the governments estate department, in charge of the quarters, has faced in showing the door to those who overstay. The rent is a pittance, too. Nahim, for instance, forked out Rs 350 for a house that would have fetched Rs 10,000 

 Around 17,600 government quarters are believed to be under illegal occupation in the Andhra Pradesh capital since the past 12 years, with many of the illegal occupants being IAS and IPS officers. Some are former legislators. Most of the squatters have a huge influence in the administration, said estate officer Gopala Reddy. 

 Green fears in rain order

 Mumbais green brigade has seen red in a new order the monsoon procedure applied to cut down weak trees.

 The new regulation is meant to help residents who are in danger from trees that could be uprooted easily by the strong monsoon winds and the incessant downpour. But environment activists are worried the rule will be used to fell trees that obstruct the citys countless billboards.

 The order, passed by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation after heavy rains last week caused 450 trees to fall, allows its quick-response squads to cut trees within 24 hours. Normally, applications to fell trees go through several checks at the civic body before clearance from top officials.

 There are fears the 24-hour order, meant to be an emergency measure, will be used to feed vested commercial interests.

 Power punch

 Delhi residents facing harassment from private electricity distribution companies now have help at hand. 

 Flooded with complaints concerning the Reliance-owned BSES which took over much of the capitals electricity infrastructure four years back the Delhi government will provide legal assistance to those who wish to fight back. 

 Called the Office of Electricity Consumer Advocate, a cell of lawyers employed by the capitals government will represent residents at any legal forum in their battle against harassment. 

 Common complaints against the private electricity provider include cases of residents being over-charged, or fined for non-payment of bills already paid. The government has also come under attack from several groups of citizens who accuse the authorities of shrugging off its responsibility since the 2003 privatisation. 

 Speed link

 After the metro, Mumbai has more to look forward to.

 Next on the fast track is a train that covers the 900-km stretch from Mumbai to Nagpur in only three-and-a-half hours. Now, the journey takes over 12 hours.

 Last month, the state government announced the formation of a committee of experts to examine aspects of the high-speed corridor. The panel will also explore the possibility of starting such rail links cruising at 500km per hour and based on magnetic levitation to other key Maharashtra towns.

 Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said government agencies like Cidco and Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority will help push the project. 

 Bangalore: If she delighted you in the Shah Rukh-starrer Kabhi Haan, Kabhi Na and if you listened to her albums later, watch another aspect of the actress-singer come alive on canvas. Suchitra Krishnamoorthy showcases her paintings at Renaissance Gallerie, Cunningham Road, till July 10.

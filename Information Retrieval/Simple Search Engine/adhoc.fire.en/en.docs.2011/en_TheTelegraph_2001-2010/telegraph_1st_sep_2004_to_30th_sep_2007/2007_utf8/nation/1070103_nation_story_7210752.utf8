The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Ladies more keen than lads to step out of parent shadow

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 2: Your girlfriend will love it when you tell her this. More young women would like to be seen as givers in society than men, who would rather take home that fat pay packet from a dreary job. But both would earn for family, not fun. 

 The concluding part of The Telegraphs survey of the youth in five cities, carried out by Mode, is that more ladies want the money to step out of their parents shadows than lads.

 Young men appear to idolise Scrooge, keen to stash away their earnings in retirement schemes, but neither sex feels under pressure to catch up with peers on salaries.

 Dont ask your girlfriend if she would like to watch a movie. She would, almost as much as you. Books and music will interest her, too, but girls do not seem to be as keen as boys on pubbing with friends.

 Live-in relationships are cool. Almost as many men and women think that way, though more guys are keen on love marriage. 

 Didnt we already know it? Neither is ready to write off arranged alliances, though.

 Breaking free of parents is also fashionable. Casual sex is the way to go only for a small section of men, about 29 per cent. 

 But theres a twist here: more graduates, than college-goers, crave for it.

 Almost as many men and women are put off by meddlesome parents and prying partners.

 Both would like that appreciative glance at their looks, though more women would like to be praised for their knowledge. 

 Young ladies fancy a career at an MNC, and thats true for those in college and the graduates. Homesick girls better watch out guys are more likely to hop on to the earliest flight to Silicon Valley. More men (17 per cent) than women (14 per cent) prefer to work abroad.

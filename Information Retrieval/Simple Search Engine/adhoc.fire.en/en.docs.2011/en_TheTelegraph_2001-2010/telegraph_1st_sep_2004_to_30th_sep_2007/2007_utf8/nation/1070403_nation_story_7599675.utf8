 Jamshedpur, April 2: A man was duped into buying a bottle of red fluid that was passed off as blood at the threshold of Jamshedpur Blood Bank today.

 Shiv Narayan Chowdhary was rushing into the bank to pick up blood for his wife Rekha admitted in Sai Nursing Home with appendicitis and a stone in her gall bladder when a tout accosted him.

 The tout convinced Shiv he would be wise to buy blood from him, as procedures in the bank were long-drawn and time-consuming. But he would have to pay Rs 50 more for the instant service.

 Not smelling a rat, Shiv, who makes a living by selling cakes in Adityapur slums, forked out Rs 800 and handed him the hospital requisition slip and an icebox.

 I paid immediately and asked him to arrange the blood as soon as possible, Shiv said.

 In 30 minutes, the man was back with the bottle of + blood and a receipt. 

 Shiv, kept satisfied with a cup of tea as he waited outside the bank, raced back to the nursing home only to be told by the doctor that the blood was fake.

 The liquid he got me was a mixture of water and red colour, resembling aalta that women put on their feet, Shiv, a resident of Adityapur, said.

 Asked how he had not seen through the racketeer, Shiv said: His frequent and free movement in and out of the blood bank made me think he was genuine.

 Police have registered a case against unknown persons operating a fake blood racket based on Shivs statement. The incident has been brought to the notice of the blood bank authorities.

 Senior medical officer S.K. Singh said sale of fake blood was rampant outside the organisation but technically the bank has nothing to do with it.

 Despite my request to hospitals and nursing homes to ensure blood is procured only from inside the bank, it is being bought from outside, the medical officer said.

 Singh said steps would be taken immediately to install closed-circuit televisions in the bank and restrict entry of visitors.

 This is the only blood bank in the Singhbhum region. It sells about 36,000 units a year.

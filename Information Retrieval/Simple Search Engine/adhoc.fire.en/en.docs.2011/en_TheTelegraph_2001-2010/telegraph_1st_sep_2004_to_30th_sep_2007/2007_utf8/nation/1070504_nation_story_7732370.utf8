 Mumbai, May 3: Bombay High Court today asked Mumbai police commissioner Dhananjay Jadhav to examine lapses, if any, in the investigation and prosecution of the Alistair Pareira hit-and-run case. 

 No concession can be made to the state for such insensitivity in a case where seven people lost their lives, a division bench of Chief Justice Swantanter Kumar and Justice S.C. Dharmadhikari said, asking the commissioner to file a detailed report by June 6.

 On April 13, a sessions court had sentenced 21-year-old Pareira, a Bandra businessmans son, to six months simple imprisonment for rash and negligent driving and causing injury. Pariera was acquitted of the principal charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder because the prosecution could not produce enough evidence.

 On April 19, the high court had pulled up the prosecution for its shoddy handling of the case. It decided to intervene and issued notices to Mumbai police to probe if Pareira had got away lightly.

 An allegedly drunk Pareira had run over pavement dwellers on Carter Road, killing seven and injuring eight in the early hours of November 12, 2006, while dropping six friends home after a party at a five-star hotel.

 The judges today asked the prosecution why it had not examined any of Pareiras friends, who had witnessed the incident. Prosecutor Anuradha Marelikar had examined only 18 of the 40 witnesses, even excluding the three policemen who were the first to reach the spot.

 The judges asked Pareira, who was present in court today without his lawyers, how he managed to deposit Rs 5 lakh for his bail so quickly within half and hour after the sessions court judgment. 

 The courts line of questioning indicated that it was trying to probe if Pareira knew in advance the exact amount he would need to deposit. Pareira replied that his father had arranged the amount. But the court said it should be investigated.

 The bench also took the state government to task and said it should treat the rich and the poor equally. Equality begins at the door of the state, the judges said.

 They asked the state counsel what action the government had initiated against the investigating officer for the inept handling of the investigations.

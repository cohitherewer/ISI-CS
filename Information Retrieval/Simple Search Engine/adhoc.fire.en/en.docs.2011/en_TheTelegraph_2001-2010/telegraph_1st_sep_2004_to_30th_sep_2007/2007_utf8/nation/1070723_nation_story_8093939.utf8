 New Delhi, July 22: Delhi police commissioner K.K. Paul has sought security cover for himself and his family as he fears an attack from one of his inspectors.

 Paul, according to a communiqu from the Delhi police headquarters, said he faces a threat from inspector Balbir Singh who had opposed his action of suspending inspector Devendra Manchanda last year. Singh has been absconding since he spoke out against Paul in October.

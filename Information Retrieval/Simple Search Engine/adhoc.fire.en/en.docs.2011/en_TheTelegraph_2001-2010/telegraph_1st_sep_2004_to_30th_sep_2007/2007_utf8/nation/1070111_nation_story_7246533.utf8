 Govt hardens stand on army teeth

 Antony: Tough measures

 Rangapahar (Nagaland) Jan. 10: The defence ministry has practically ruled out a repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act in the wake of the Assam carnage and the decision to give the army sweeping powers in a renewed drive against Ulfa. 

 Defence minister A.K. Antony said here at the headquarters of the armys 3 Corps today that when our soldiers are operating in such difficult situations, they need special protection. We are in consultations with the home ministry, if needed, to give it (the army act) a human touch. 

 The 3 Corps is responsible for a large swathe of the Northeast and all of Manipur, which has been in ferment over the scrapping of the act. 

 The killing of soft targets like Hindi-speaking migrants in Assam has strengthened the defence ministrys case against diluting the act even though Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had himself taken the lead in the governments internal discussions.

 I am just coming from Assam where more than 60 people have been killed, Antony said during his stopover here as part of his two-day visit to the region. 

 It is a heinous crime. The poorest of the poor have been killed for no reason. We (the army) are not interested in participating in this kind of activity (counter-insurgency operations) because the armys primary job is to guard the borders. But when the army is called, they need this kind of protection, he stressed.

 The legislation has to stay, but we are not against giving it a human touch, the defence minister added. 

 The Justice Jeevan Reddy Committee had recommended that the army act be scrapped, but it had also added that the government should consider amending the Disturbed Areas Act to give it more teeth, particularly on granting some kind of immunity to soldiers while they are in counter-insurgency operations. 

 The defence ministers observations have effectively put paid to any move to repeal the act. 

 Antony also said that despite cordial relations with Myanmar, it was too early to speculate on a Bhutan-type operation against militants based in that country.

 In December 2003, the army had co-ordinated with the Bhutanese army to launch Operation All Clear a hammer-and-anvil military move against Ulfa camps in the kingdom. 

 Even now, some of the troublemakers are getting shelter in Myanmar and Bangladesh. But recently we have been talking to Myanmar and our relations are becoming more cordial, he said.

 In Guwahati, thousands of soldiers backed by helicopters have launched a major offensive against Ulfa bases in the jungles of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

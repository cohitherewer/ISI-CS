 Credit card glare on bank

 New Delhi, May 13 (PTI): ICICI Bank has been accused of making at least one false promise to its credit card customers and not following some guidelines set by the RBI.

 The preliminary report by the director-general of investigation and registration under the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission said the bank had issued more than 50 types of special credit cards but did not explain their features, benefits and liabilities. 

 Some of these cards were the solid gold card, Bajaj capital card, Help-Age India card, Kingfisher card and the Amway card. In some cases, special customers were promised free lifetime cards by direct sales agents of the bank, but were charged annual fees.

 The panel has already recommended action against HSBC and Citibank for not following the guidelines.

 An ICICI bank spokesperson said it had not been given an opportunity to present its case. We did not get any query nor were asked to clarify these points, said Charudatta Deshpande, head, corporate communication.

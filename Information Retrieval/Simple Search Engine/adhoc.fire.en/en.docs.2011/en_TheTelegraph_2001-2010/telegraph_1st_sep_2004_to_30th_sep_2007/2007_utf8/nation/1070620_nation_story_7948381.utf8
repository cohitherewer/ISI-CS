 Rahman at show, minus a suitcase

 Rahman, Shilpa: Count your bags

 London, June 19: British Airways, which mislaid six of Shilpa Shettys 10 suitcases just before she was due to perform at the IIFA events in Yorkshire recently, today lost A.R. Rahmans luggage just before the formal opening of his musical. 

 The composer, who had to undertake some last-minute shopping in London, landed at Heathrow on BA flight 224 from Washingtons Dulles airport minus one of his two suitcases. 

 The one suitcase that arrived unfortunately didnt have much, said Rahman, as he headed in a cab for Oxford Street and Bond Street with his assistant Simon Long to see what he could buy before the opening night of the 25-million West End musical, Lord of the Rings, for which he has partly composed the music. 

 He had hoped to look elegant in his Indian clothes but BA has put paid to that, just as the airline did with Shilpa. 

 The composer had made the mistake of putting many of his valuables into his now-missing suitcase to avoid being harassed at Dulles. 

 You know what American airports are like its like going through nuclear checks, said Rahman, who arrived in London after a concert in America. 

 I put my laptop in there, with all my music, my CDs and DVDs, plus the Indian clothes I was going to wear for the next two-three days, Rahman told The Telegraph. 

 The Daily Mail newspaper has been running an anti-BA campaign for its habit of losing luggage. Todays report BA baggage fiasco leaves 6,000 cases in the rain said: British Airways was last forced to drive a mountain of luggage across Europe by lorry after losing 6,000 cases in a baggage-handling fiasco. 

 When Rahman contacted BA, the airline shrugged off his query. They told me they have no idea where my luggage is. Its not in London and its not in Washington. I am happy today since my musical is opening tonight but this will hit me tomorrow. 

 Lord of the Rings, an adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkiens novel, which made a very profitable transition to the screen, is said to be the most expensive musical staged in Londons West End. 

 It features a 45-ft-diameter, 1-million stage with 17 hydraulic lifts underneath it and has been previewing at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. 

 The lavish three-hour adaptation reportedly had preview audiences screaming with fright as a 30-ft tarantula squirted ink over the front rows and orcs invaded the auditorium. 

 Kevin Wallace, the producer, said today: To our ears in London, this music has a sense of the exotic, but not to the world at large. We were blessed in Rahman, blessed as a genius to write and also blessed he agreed to collaborate with Varttina (a Finnish folk music band) and bring these two ancient traditions, fusion of music. Its a great gift, nobody writes a melody as well as this guy. We are also grateful for the mount of time AR has had for us over the years.

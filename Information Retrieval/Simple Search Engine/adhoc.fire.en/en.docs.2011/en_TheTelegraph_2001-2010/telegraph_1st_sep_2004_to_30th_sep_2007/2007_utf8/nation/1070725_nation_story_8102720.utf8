 PM nuke concord drive

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 24: The UPA government has started to hardsell the nuclear agreement by sharing the details with senior Congress ministers of the Manmohan Singh government.

 At a meeting chaired by the Prime Minister today, his national security adviser M.K. Narayanan briefed Pranab Mukherjee, Shivraj Patil, A.K. Antony, P. Chidambaram, Arjun Singh and Sushil Kumar Shinde.

 It was apparent that the Congress, which heads the government, was keen to project a united front on the deal, privately critiqued by some Left-of-Centre voices in the party.

 HRD minister Arjun, who was associated with this political stream, spoke after the meet and said he was confident Parliament would endorse the deal.

 The Constitution does not require Parliaments assent for foreign treaties but, mindful of the political implications of a major Indo-US pact at home, the Prime Minister shared every relevant development with both the Houses.

 Tomorrow, the cabinet committee on political affairs would be briefed by Narayanan and foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon, who were engaged in the negotiations.

 Besides the five designated members of the cabinet committee on security affairs the Prime Minister, foreign minister, home minister, finance minister and the defence minister the political affairs body includes Arjun Singh and key representatives of allies such as Sharad Pawar, Lalu Prasad and T.R. Baalu.

 An agreement in the political affairs body is seen as a prelude to evolving a larger consensus.

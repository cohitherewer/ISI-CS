 New Delhi, March 31: Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major who took over as the chief of air staff today said he would work to transform the Indian Air Force (IAF) into an aerospace force.

 Major, who was chief of the Eastern Air Command, replaces Air Chief Marshal Shashindra Pal Tyagi who retired today. Major is the first helicopter pilot to head the IAF.

 Tyagi, given a send-off at air headquarters, said he was happy to have served in the force for four decades. But he leaves in the knowledge that his efforts to induct 126 multi-role combat aircraft quickly have been frustrated. He was hopeful that the global tender would be out by the end of the current fiscal year but the government has not done it yet.

 But Tyagi sought to make amends for the IAFs falling strength by stitching up a deal in double-quick time to buy 40 additional Sukhoi 30 MKI aircraft from Russia.

 Tyagi has been quoted several times in the last two years as saying the tenders for the 126 fighter aircraft will be out shortly. Asked why the tenders were held up, he said today: I dont know. I think somebody else should answer the question. 

 That somebody else is Air Chief Marshal Major. 

 Soon after assuming office, he said the tenders will be out soon. But he did not spell out the details, aware that the issue is a political and maybe even diplomatic hot potato.

 Major chose, instead, to put the transformation of the IAF into an aerospace force on the front-burner. The government is still undecided on the IAFs proposal to create a separate aerospace command that would bring under it space-based assets now controlled by various government agencies.

 It is only through the employment of space-based application that we can be more effective beyond our shores, Major told senior officers in his order of the day.

 Hardware may give us the capabilities, but it is the man behind the machine that can give us the winning edge, he added.

 Major has served in the IAF for 39 years and caught national attention in 1992 for a dare-devil rescue of 11 tourists stranded in a disabled cable car in Himachal Pradesh.

 He was the chief of the Eastern Air Command headquartered in Shillong since September 2005. Last year, the India-US air exercises in Kalaikunda were conducted under his leadership.

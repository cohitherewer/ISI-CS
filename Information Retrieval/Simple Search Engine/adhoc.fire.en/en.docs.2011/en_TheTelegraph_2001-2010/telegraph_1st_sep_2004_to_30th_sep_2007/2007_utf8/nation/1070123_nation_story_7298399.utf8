 Bad tidings ahead of Cuttack clash

 - Telecast tussle between Nimbus amp; DD reaches court

 OUR BUREAU AND PTI

 New Delhi, Jan. 22: Before Rahul Dravids boys troop to the field, another battle will be fought over the men in blue between men in black.

 Public broadcaster Prasar Bharati and private network Nimbus Communications will see each other in court tomorrow after they failed to reach a deal tonight on live telecast of the India-West Indies one-day series.

 If Delhi High Court gives no directives, cricket lovers who are banking on Doordarshan to bring home live Wednesdays face-off in Cuttack will be disappointed again. Yesterday, millions of them had missed Indias 14-run victory in Nagpur in the first of the four-match series.

 The Cuttack match may not even be seen on Doordarshans direct-to-home service. So far no DTH service is buying Neo Sports, the Nimbus sports channel.

 Nimbus, which paid the cricket board $612 million for exclusive rights to all BCCI-organised matches in India till 2010, approached the high court this morning, challenging government guidelines which compel private broadcasters to share live feed of important sports events with Doordarshan.

 Prasar Bharati, on its part, filed a caveat in the Supreme Court and the high courts in Mumbai and Delhi, saying the courts should take no decision unless they hear its side of the story.

 Delhi High Court fixed the hearing for tomorrow.

 Nimbus chief executive officer Digvijay Singh came over to the office of Prasar Bharati CEO B.S. Lalli for the latest round of talks this evening, several hours after the matter had reached the courts. As expected, both stuck to their positions.

 We offered Prasar Bharati that they can have live feed of the matches if they encrypt signals or else they can go in for a 15-minute delayed feed, Singh said after the talks.

 However, since they do not agree to both of these, all I can say is they can come to the stadium with their equipment and go live if they believe they are so entitled under the guidelines.

 Asked if this would not be illegal, he said: Let them first do it, then we will see.

 DD director-general L.D. Mandloi ruled out live recording from the stadium. How can we do it without an agreement? Its not possible at all.

 Even before his meeting with the Nimbus CEO, Lalli had told reporters Prasar Bharati could not accept the 15-minute gap. That would be like offering people stale bread, he said. 

 And encryption, he argued, was a technical nightmare: it would mean Doordarshan would stop being a free-to-air channel. And, in any case, installing decoders for 1,400-odd DD transmitters would take a long time.

 Nimbus argues that it is willing to let the matches be seen live on Doordarshans terrestrial channels, accessed through rooftop antennas. But unless the signal is encrypted, the terrestrial channel can also be seen over Direct Plus, DDs free DTH service.

 This, the sports channel claims, would result in a big loss in advertisement revenue.

 In the high court today, Nimbus said imposing conditions for sharing feed were arbitrary and whimsical and the guidelines also violated its fundamental rights under Articles 14 (right to equality) and 19 (right to trade).

 In Calcutta, information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who yesterday accused Nimbus of being unpatriotic, questioned the BCCI move to sell exclusive rights to the company as terrestrial rights were not under the cricket boards jurisdiction.

 Ahmedabad, April 2: Narendra Modi may go on garlanding Gandhi statues, the Congress will not let him pedal away with a piece of the Mahatmas legacy.

 The party yesterday flagged off the 13-day Mahatma Gandhi Sandesh Cycle Yatra from the Sabarmati Ashram to spread the Mahatmas ideas and expose the Gujarat chief ministers communal and divisive politics agenda.

 The 250 cyclists, seen off by veteran freedom fighter Nirmala Deshpande, will cover 537 km across five districts of western Gujarat and Saurashtra, considered BJP strongholds. 

 The yatra will end on April 13 at the Mahatmas birthplace Porbandar, where Congress president Sonia Gandhi will address a rally.

 The flag-off was attended by a galaxy of freedom fighters as well as Congress MP Priya Dutt, Sonias political adviser Ahmed Patel and the AICC general secretary in charge of Gujarat, B.K. Hariprasad.

 Modi had begun the year by mentioning the Mahatma at every function, trying to exploit his name to play his favourite game of stoking Gujarats asmita (pride). 

 Currently, he has been campaigning aggressively, addressing at least one convention every week in some part of the state.

 The yatra is the Congresss reply. 

 The party will try to pep up its workers by getting either a Union minister or a senior All India Congress Committee leader to address rallies at places where the riders halt for the night.

 The state Congress is also trying to draft Rahul Gandhi, Kapil Sibal and Mani Shankar Aiyar to join its poll efforts.

 Its time we began spreading Gandhis message, Priya Dutt said. You will see many such programmes being organised and more frequently.

 Let every heart become the temple of Gandhian thought, Deshpande said.

 But Gandhian Chuni Vaidya was sceptical. Its fashionable to talk about Gandhi and his thoughts, but what is important is that we practise Gandhian values the simple living that he preached. As he used to say, his life was his message.

 I do not see that happening. To me, this appears to be just politics. Many of the cyclists may be here because they want a party ticket for the elections.

 Yatra co-ordinator Maulik Vashnav insisted that all the riders are Seva Dal workers. They are selfless and committed to the partys programme. They believe that Gandhi is not the past but the future.

 Advani does 

a Draupadi 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Advani

 Ayodhya, May 6: In the Mahabharata, Draupadi vowed not to tie her hair till Dushyashan was killed. Now its L.K. Advanis turn.

 The BJP leader today said he would not utter Jai Sri Ram until a proper Ram temple is built at the site of the makeshift one.

 I think I will utter Jai Sri Ram only once a proper Ram temple is built in Ayodhya. Now there is a makeshift temple. But we want a proper temple to be built, the BJP leader said.

 Advani, campaigning for BJP candidate Lallu Singh, a four-time MLA from Ayodhya, addressed a rally as part of the last leg of his campaign that also took him to Gorakhpur. The states seven-stage election ends on Tuesday.

 When he arrived at the rally to chants of Jai Sri Ram the war cry for temple hardliners from BJP supporters, Advani sensed the issue was on the minds of voters. 

 The former BJP president recalled how the Ayodhya movement changed the course of his life, that of his partys and the countrys history. The familiar refrain that Ayodhya is more than a political issue wasnt missing, either. 

 Let there be no confusion about the importance of Ayodhya in the BJP. We are committed to building the temple and I appeal to members of other communities to join the movement for its construction, said Advani, whose last visit here was after the July 2005 raid on the makeshift temple. 

 Then, too, he had called upon people to work hard to build a proper temple. Today, Advani offered prayers at the makeshift temple before leaving for Delhi. 

 On Friday, Kalyan Singh, projected as the BJPs chief ministerial candidate, had visited the site. 

 Talking of ways to resolve the temple dispute, Advani said he preferred an out-of-court settlement, through a Hindu-Muslim dialogue, to a judicial solution. A court order, he said, might not be acceptable to either community.

 The former deputy Prime Minister denied accusations he was against Muslims and said he was only opposed to Islamic terrorism.

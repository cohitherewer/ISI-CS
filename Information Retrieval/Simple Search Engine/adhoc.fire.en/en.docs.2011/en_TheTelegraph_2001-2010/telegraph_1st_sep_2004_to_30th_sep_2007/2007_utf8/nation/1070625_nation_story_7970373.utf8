 No ramp walk in schools, were Indian

 Bhopal, June 24: Fashion shows have been banned in schools and girls colleges of moral Madhya Pradesh.

 The education departments guidelines for the academic session beginning July warn institutions against holding such shows as part of annual day celebrations or on any other occasion. The reason: fashion shows are alien to Indian culture.

 These events can lead to vices. Educational institutions are sacred places like temples and mosques. Their sanctity must be maintained at all costs, said BJP spokesperson Archana Chitnis.

 Any school or college that defies the order will stand to lose recognition or affiliation, the guidelines add.

 BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh has in the past banned sex education in schools and the sale of eggs, meat and liquor in holy cities all in the name of Indian culture. It is also considering a ban on a vibrating condom.

 Does the Madhya Pradesh government think the fashion and entertainment industry is worthless or illegal? asked the principal of a girls college who did not want to be named. 

 Neighbouring Gujarat, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, which are also ruled by the BJP, have not imposed a ban, she pointed out. Are they lacking in cultural nationalism? 

 If schools and colleges and their students are chafing at the ban, the ruling BJP is sure it has done the right thing. 

 There are far better ways of developing personality than participating in these so-called fashion parades, said Chitnis, who as minister for school education had called for such a ban and now feels vindicated. 

 I tell all girls the same thing. Do well in education. Have values and remain close to your roots. This will lead to all-round personality development.

 Technically, co-education and boys colleges can still hold fashion shows now almost an annual ritual in all colleges because the guidelines are for girls institutions only. But after the warning, its unlikely anyone would want to risk the governments wrath.

 The three-and-a-half-year-old BJP rule in Madhya Pradesh has seen several fashion shows and cultural evenings coming under attack from mobs. It began in December 2003, the month Uma Bharti took over as chief minister. 

 On December 31, Bajrang Dal activists staged a noisy protest against a fashion show at a hotel in Indore. Valentines Day was the next target. 

 Dozens of other incidents followed over the years. On April 23 this year, singer-composer Shankar Mahadevan had to call off his concert midway after Bajrang Dal activists stormed in saying his songs were vulgar and the sound too loud for their comfort. Most of the time, police have been silent spectators. 

 Now, state ministers Kamal Patel and Kailash Vijayvargiya are waging a campaign against the sale of vibrating condoms, which they describe as a sex toy.

 They also want action from the Centre and reassurance that condoms are solely for birth control, not pleasure.

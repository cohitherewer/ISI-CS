 Macho? Finding a wife wont be easy

 G.S. MUDUR

New Delhi, Aug. 8: Men seeking long-term relationships may be better off sporting healthy faces than touting machismo. A new study has shown that women view masculine men as unsuitable long-term partners.

 The study by psychologists in the UK has bolstered previous findings that highly masculine men have difficulty in long-term relationships. It has also shown that health is a stronger signal for potential long-term relationships and personality.

 Healthier faces were perceived as more ambitious, committed, faithful, warmer and as better parents in the study, conducted through a web-based experiment to find out how and what facial features influence perceptions of attractiveness.

 The results, published in the latest issue of the journal Personality and Individual Differences, contradict previous suggestions by some scientists that machismo signals fitness. Masculinity may buy you romance, but not necessarily tip top physical condition. Instead, women see a healthy guy as fit for family life, said David Perrett, professor of psychology at the University of St Andrews. 

 This study confirms the link between masculinity and the lack of commitment, Perrett told The Telegraph. It also points to the importance of health in decisions involving the choice of a partner. 

 Men with masculine facial features such as a square jaw, large nose and small eyes were viewed by the studys participants as more dominant, less faithful, worse parents, and with personalities less warm than men with feminine features. 

 They also viewed men with feminine features such as wide eyes and thin or curved eyebrows or full lips as less likely to cheat on partners and more committed in relationships.

 Scientists believe such studies of perceptions of attractiveness will provide fresh insights into evolutionary biology as well as throw up new leads that may help in counselling and psychology. 

 Evolutionary biologists have assumed for long that masculinity is an indicator of healthy, good genes. Our findings do not support that. We find that masculinity and health are two independent factors, Lynda Boothroyd, the lead author of the study, said. But, unlike masculinity, health doesnt appear to have a drawback in terms of perceived attractiveness. 

 The psychologists asked volunteers to evaluate digitally altered pictures of male faces on a computer made to look more masculine or more feminine and assign personality traits, including sexual behaviour and parenting potential, to them.

 Previous studies have suggested that men with high testosterone levels a measure of masculinity have difficulty in maintaining good quality long-term relationships.

 Colour and complexion are among facial features signalling health, said Perrett who has been engaged in research on perceptions of attractiveness for over a decade.

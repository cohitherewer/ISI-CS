 Tarmac bonus for Mayavati

 OUR BUREAU

 Mayavati

 New Delhi, April 16: Mayavati can drive straight up to the ladder of a plane at all airports across the country.

 The privilege to the Bahujan Samaj Party chief has been extended in a decision taken recently by the home ministry. 

 The move comes at a time when the Congress, after parting ways with the Samajwadi Party, has been looking for ways to court Mayavati, seen as a front-runner in the race to form the next government in Uttar Pradesh.

 The order is likely to kick up a controversy as the ministry has not explained what makes the BSP chief special.

 Three categories of VIPs can drive straight to the tarmac: those who are highly threatened individuals with NSG protection or are ill; and those who deserve the privilege for protocol reasons.

 The President, Vice-President, Prime Minister and serving chief ministers are allowed to drive up to stairs of planes. 

 Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi was included in the list on health grounds. So also former Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basu. 

 Mayavati does not fall into any of these categories. She had sought such permission a few months ago, but the government kept a decision pending, BSP sources said. 

 A fresh assessment of her security in the Z-plus grade was made recently. 

 Ministry sources said the request from Mayavati was not new. But it was not granted as the ministry did not see any threat to her.

 This time, the nudge came from higher ups, sources said, adding the directive was given to to the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security.

 Mid Day hearing in January 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: The Supreme Court will hear on January 16 the appeal of the four Mid Day journalists sentenced by Delhi High Court to four months in jail on contempt charges. They will remain free till the hearing.

 City editor M.K. Tayal, editor Vitusha Oberoi and printer-publisher S.K. Akhtar were convicted of publishing articles alleging that former Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwals sons benefited from his order on the sealing drive against commercial establishments in the capital. 

 Cartoonist Irfan Khan had drawn a sketch of the judge. 

 Execution of the sentence is stayed till further orders, a two-judge bench said. It rejected an appeal by activists to implead the four in the case. They said the high court order violated freedom of the press.

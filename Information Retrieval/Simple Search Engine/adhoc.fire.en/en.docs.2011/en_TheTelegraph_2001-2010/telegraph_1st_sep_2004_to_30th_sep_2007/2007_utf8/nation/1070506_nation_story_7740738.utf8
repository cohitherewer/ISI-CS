 New Delhi, May 5: Rahul Gandhi today said he had a post-poll strategy in mind for Uttar Pradesh, which is likely to throw up a hung House, but would not disclose it.

 As he spoke to the media during his Gorakhpur roadshow, the Amethi MP added that the decision on any post-poll alliance would be taken by party president Sonia Gandhi and her senior colleagues.

 Who will form the government, what will be the role of the Congress after the elections and how the Congress will be involved in it will be decided by the Congress president and the senior leaders, a release sent later via email by Rahuls media department quoted him as saying.

 I have my own opinion but would not like to share it. Our aim is to take the party ahead in the state and the decision which helps us to do so will be taken by the senior leaders.

 A senior Congress source in Delhi said the partys first preference would be to try to explore all possibilities for government formation even if the verdict was fractured.

 The party is clear about certain broad elements of its strategy. First, a reconciliation with the Samajwadis is ruled out, at least in the near future. 

 Second, any pact with Mayavatis BSP would depend on the actual numbers. If the BSP crosses 160 and needs another 40-odd, the Congress would consider approaching her. Exit polls predict that the Congress would improve on its 2002 tally of 25, but not by much.

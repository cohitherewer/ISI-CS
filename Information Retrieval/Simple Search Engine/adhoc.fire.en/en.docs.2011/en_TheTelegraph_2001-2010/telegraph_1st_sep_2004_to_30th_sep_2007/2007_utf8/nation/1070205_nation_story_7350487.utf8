 Knowledge cell feud reaches Left court

 Sam Pitroda: Dictatorial?

 New Delhi, Feb. 4: Split by policy issues like quotas and education reforms, the Prime Ministers showpiece body for education, the National Knowledge Commission, is now rocked by feuding at the top.

 Its vice-chairperson, P.M. Bhargava, yesterday met CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan to seek the Lefts help in his battle against chairperson Sam Pitroda.

 Bardhan will write to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh about Pitrodas style which critics dub unilateral and dictatorial. He has asked Bhargava to also inform Singh about how the six-member commissions functioning has been marred by tensions.

 The battle has as much to do with ideological issues as with personal feuds.

 Manmohan Singh had conceived, created and nurtured the commission despite frowns from the Union human resource development ministry, which saw it as a rival that would chart its own policies in education.

 When human resource development minister Arjun Singh came out with his brainchild, the 27 per cent reservation for other backward class (OBC) students, the commission was caught up in the countrywide storm.

 Two of its then eight members, Andre Beteille and Pratap Bhanu Mehta, resigned. The stand by the commissions majority anti-quota lobby, which included Pitroda, drew the Left closer to Arjun.

 At his meeting with Bardhan, Bhargava is believed to have reeled out a string of complaints against the commission chairperson. 

 Pitroda, he said, does not take into account the opinion of the other members.

 When Pitroda handed a report by the commission to the Prime Minister last month, Bhargava had boycotted the event, saying the panels members were not involved in drafting the report.

 Bhargava has dismissed the report as just a bundle of letters and reports already sent to the Prime Minister. He alleged that Pitroda had ignored repeated requests from him for more discussions on the paper on higher education.

 This part of the report suggested an overhaul of the current system, which involved stripping the University Grants Commission of all powers except that of disbursing funds.

 In the UGCs place, the commission recommended a professional regulatory body that would include academics and not bureaucrats. The HRD ministry has remained non-committal, but Arjun cant be too happy.

 I have dissociated myself from the note on higher education and have submitted a separate note, Bhargava said. Pitroda showcaused me after I spoke to the media.

 Pitroda could not be contacted for comment.

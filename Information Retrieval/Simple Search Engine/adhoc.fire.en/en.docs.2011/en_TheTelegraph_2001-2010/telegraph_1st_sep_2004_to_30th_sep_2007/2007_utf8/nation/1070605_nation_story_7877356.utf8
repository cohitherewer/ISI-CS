 BMW lawyers suspended

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 4: The Supreme Court Bar Association today suspended senior advocates R.K. Anand and I.U. Khan, who have been accused of attempting to influence a witness in the BMW case.

 The association has decided to suspend the two as an interim measure and issued showcause notices to them. 

 The Bar Council of Delhi has also sought their response to the TV channel expose showing alleged collusion between Khan, representing the prosecution, and Anand, the defence lawyer. If they are found guilty of misconduct, the council can suspend or revoke their licence to practice.

 Association head P.H. Parekh said a three-member panel, including himself, would look into the matter and submit a report within a month.

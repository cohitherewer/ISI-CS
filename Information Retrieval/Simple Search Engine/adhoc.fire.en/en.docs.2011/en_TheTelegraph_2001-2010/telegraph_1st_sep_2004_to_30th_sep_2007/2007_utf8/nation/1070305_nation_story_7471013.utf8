 Samjhauta test for Pak

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, March 4: India will not reveal the hard evidence it has on the Samjhauta Express and Mumbai train bombings or the Malegaon blasts at the March 6-7 talks in Islamabad, officials say.

 The three-member team led by K.C. Singh, additional secretary in the foreign ministry, will only provide basic evidence like mob- ile transcripts and confession statements at the talks on a joint anti-terror mechanism.

 India wants to gauge the Pakistani response before revealing its hand, the officials said.

 This would be a test case. We dont want to open up everything, including hard intelligence details, only to get a firm denial and let everything go in a limbo, a source said.

 If there is a positive signal and Pakistan seems sincere in taking forward the Havana declaration between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President (Pervez) Musharraf to have a joint anti-terrorism mech-anism we will work out how to share the solid evidence.

 Officials had earlier told The Telegraph that intelligence agencies had mobile intercepts and details of conversations between those involved in the Samjhauta blasts and their collaborators across the border. 

 They had named the Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed as the prime suspects.

 The sources said the Indian team would try to persuade the Pakistanis to agree to an extradition treaty and other systems that would allow each of the neighbours to get their hands on accused hiding in the other country.

 One is a mutual legal assistance treaty, under which Delhi can get witnesses and accused from Pakistan to attend trials in Indian courts, and vice versa. 

 Another is an agreement to act on Interpol red-corner notices issued at each others request.

 Officials here believe that if India and Pakistan manage to put in place these systems even in the long run, it would help India get its hands on its most wanted, like Dawood Ibrahim.

 They admit that bringing Pakistan round would be difficult, but say a beginning should be made.

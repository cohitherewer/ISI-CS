 Four birthdays for aspiring CM

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 V.K. Malhotra

 New Delhi, Jan. 28: The BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, Vijay Kumar Malhotra, celebrated his 76th birthday this afternoon for the fourth time in the last two months.

 The first event to celebrate his birthday was held on December 19 at which A.B. Vajpayee, L.K. Advani, Rajnath Singh and RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan came to congratulate him.

 The second was held at former Delhi chief minister Sahib Singhs house earlier this month. Then the BJPs newly-elected MP Shahnawaz Hussain threw a party for him on January 25. And today, Malhotra himself invited people over for lunch.

 Characteristically, the BJP members have discovered a term for the birthday celebrations that go on for months. They are calling it the amrit mahotsava, a lot like the sahastra chandra darshan (spotting of the thousand moons) event that the late Pramod Mahajan organised last year to celebrate Vajpayees 81st birthday.

 The expression amrit mahotsava, that goes for Malhotras birthday, apparently refers to celebrations relating to a persons 75th birthday.

 Malhotras official date of birth, according to his short biographical sketch submitted to the Lok Sabha secretariat, is December 3, 1931. That makes him 76. However, his party insists he is 75, the age to qualify as an amrit mahotsava candidate.

 The logic behind a section in the party going to such lengths for him is that he wants to be projected as the chief ministerial candidate for Delhi.

 Since Madan Lal Khuranas ouster, the BJP is left with very few choices for this post. Among the Delhi leaders, Sahib Singh proved such a disaster as chief minister that most in the party believe he was responsible for the BJP getting wiped out in the capital for 10 long years. Delhi unit president Harsh Vardhan has strong RSS backing, but he does not have a popular profile and lacks charisma.

 BJP president Rajnath Singh is personally hoping Arun Jaitley would take on the job. But that remains at the level of wishful thinking as Jaitley moving into provincial politics translates into elimination of a strong political challenge for Rajnath.

 Malhotra knows this and is hoping that he will stand a chance. He comes with strong credentials, having been the chief executive councillor, Delhi administration (chief minister in protocol), and a member of the metropolitan council of Delhi for 10 years.

 Hence, it is raining birthdays for Malhotra. The difficulty is there is a year more to go for elections to be announced to the Delhi Assembly. That could be a tad too long for the politics of birthdays to bear fruit for the Delhi veteran.

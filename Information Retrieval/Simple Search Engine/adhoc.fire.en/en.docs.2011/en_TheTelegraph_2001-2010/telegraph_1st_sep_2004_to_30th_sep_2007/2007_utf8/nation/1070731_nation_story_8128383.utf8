 Colleague axed for Haneef link

 Melbourne, July 30 (PTI): An Indian doctor who worked with Mohammed Haneef at Gold Coast Hospital and was interrogated in connection with the failed UK terror plot has been suspended.

 A Queensland health spokesperson said today that director-general Uschi Schreiber had suspended Mohamed Ali with pay after receiving information from Queensland police.

 Schreiber said the information did not relate to terrorism allegations but the matter had been referred to the crime and misconduct commission and the medical board of Queensland, according to the media here.

 Ali was taken into police custody shortly after Haneef was detained on July 2 but was released after questioning. 

 Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Keelty said there was nothing to suggest that Ali had committed a crime and he was free to return to the community.

 The doctors were both recruited from Liverpool in England and sponsored on 457 work visas by Queensland Health.

 The spokesperson said Ali was suspended on Friday evening, around the same time Haneef was freed from Wolsten Correctional Centre after the terror charge against him was dropped. 

 Ali will remain suspended until the investigation against him is complete, the spokesperson added.

 Plea to doctors

 Fearing that overseas doctors may turn their backs on Australia following the Haneef episode, Queensland premier Peter Beattie has appealed to them not to do so.

 I appeal to all of those foreign-trained doctors who we need to provide day-to-day medical services to Queenslanders to stick with us, he said.

 Beattie feared that immigration minister Kevin Andrewss handling of Haneefs case could jeopardise Queenslands recruitment campaign for foreign-trained doctors, an ABC report said today.

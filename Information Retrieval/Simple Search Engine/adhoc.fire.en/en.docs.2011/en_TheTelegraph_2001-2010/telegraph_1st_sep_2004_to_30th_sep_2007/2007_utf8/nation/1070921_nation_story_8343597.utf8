 Srinagar, Sept. 20: A government officer found to be a US citizen has been arrested in Srinagar.

 Aijaz Ahmad Bhat headed the Jammu and Kashmir governments forest corporation until recently. 

 The Indian Forest Service officer was arrested after a crime branch raid recovered a US passport from his residence with a valid Indian visa till 2013, said additional superintendent of police Ghulam Haider Badana. Bhat has been sent to 10 days police remand.

 It is quite evident that he is a US citizen, Badana added.

 The IFS officer had gone on unauthorised leave from government service in the nineties and shifted to the US along with his family.

 He acquired US citizenship in 2000 and was working there in a private company. He returned to the Valley last year to get back his employment, a crime branch source said.

 Bhat applied for an Indian passport early this year and was about to be issued one when the regional passport office in Srinagar received an anonymous letter saying he had surrendered Indian citizenship in 2000, sources said.

 The passport office informed the crime branch, which registered a case and started a probe.

 In June last year, Bhat was appointed officer on special duty with the forest corporation after his return from the US and made its managing director two months later. 

 He appears to have been favourably accommodated by the government as he surpassed over a dozen senior officers, the source said.

 The crime branch is investigating if government officials knew about his US connection, putting the role of finance minister Tariq Hameed Qarra, who was forest minister when Bhat was appointed, under scanner.

 Qarra, however, said the decision to appoint Bhat was taken by the state cabinet. 

 If intelligence agencies and the Government of India could not, how was it possible for me to find out (that he was a US citizen)? the minister asked.

 The officer was removed from the post of corporation chairman on September 4 and attached with the general administration department after the state government ordered a probe into an alleged timber scam.

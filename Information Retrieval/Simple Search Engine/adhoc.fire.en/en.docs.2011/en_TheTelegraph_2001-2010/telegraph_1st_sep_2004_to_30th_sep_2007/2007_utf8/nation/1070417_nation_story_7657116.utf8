 Time running out for cancer girl

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 The Tata Memorial Cancer Hospital

 Mumbai, April 16: The cancer-stricken girl who was allegedly raped just before surgery at the Tata Memorial Cancer Hospital in November may not live to see her attackers punished.

 Ruksana Khan (name changed), 16, suffering from recurrent bone and soft tissue cancer in the spine, may have just two months to live, a doctor treating her said. He didnt say if her unwanted pregnancy had made matters worse.

 Her lower limbs are virtually paralysed because of pressure on her spinal chord. The disease is incurable. She is hardly in a condition to survive beyond two months, the doctor said.

 Ruksana had undergone surgery at the hospital on November 18 and December 11 last year. After she was diagnosed as pregnant on April 7, Ruksana alleged she had been raped while lying in the operation theatre under sedation before the first surgery.

 She claimed that being semi-conscious at the time, she didnt remember the act of rape, but recalled two ward boys talking obscenely about her and touching her private parts.

 Lawyers said that with time running out for Ruksana, police ought to act fast on her complaint.

 The court can order the police to complete investigations quickly. Also, her statement should be recorded in front of a magistrate as soon as possible. Her parents can pursue the case from then on, lawyer Farhana Shah said.

 Ruksana, who was discharged after her operations but came for periodic check-ups, has been sent to a relatives place with her four sisters. Her father, Kamal Khan, fears the scandal might hurt his other daughters marriage prospects.

 A further test on her by JJ Hospital on Saturday, however, has prompted some to question her allegation. The new test shows the foetus is over 27 weeks old, which means Ruksana conceived sometime early in October.

 She could still have been raped at the Tata Memorial, though, because she was admitted there on October 4. The police say fresh tests will be done on her.

 Why should my daughter lie when she knows she is not going to live? Kamal asked.

 He added that the family had asked Tata Memorial doctors about the bulge in her stomach earlier, too, but they had explained it away as a result of the operations. They said it was normal.

 We are looking at all possible angles, inspector Dinesh Kumar Verma said.

 The allegation has brought the security of female patients in city hospitals under the scanner.

 Non-medical persons are in and out of OTs, admitted Tata Memorial director Katayun A. Dinshaw. But all they do is wheel the patient out after surgery. Well find out if there were any outsiders in the OT that day.

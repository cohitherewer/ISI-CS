 Law board lines up Babri fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Rabe Hasan Nadvi

 Chennai, Jan. 9: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board today criticised the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in Uttar Pradesh, saying that even 14 years after the Babri Masjid was demolished the culprits were yet to be brought to book.

 Briefing reporters on the agenda of the law boards three-day conclave beginning here tomorrow, the bodys assistant general secretary Abdur Rahim Qureshi said that at the time of assumption of office, Mulayam had given an assurance that he would issue a notification giving jurisdiction on criminal cases relating to the demolition to a court at Lucknow.

 Expressing anguish that the chief minister had not kept his word, the law board said it was a sad commentary on the rule of law and administration of criminal justice in our country.

 The Muslim community will play a significant role in deciding Mulayams prospects when Uttar Pradesh goes to polls later this year.

 The criminal cases had been covered by two FIRs under the jurisdiction of two different courts Rae Bareli and Lucknow and the CBI filed a common chargesheet clubbing the two FIRs.

 Allahabad High Court had directed that the Uttar Pradesh government, in consultation with the court, should issue a notification conferring the jurisdiction to one of the courts to try the cases under both the FIRs, for which a single chargesheet has been filed.

 We will deliberate at this conference in what way the government of Uttar Pradesh should be made to issue this notification, Qureshi replied to a query, but did not elaborate.

 The list of accused in these criminal cases includes BJP leaders such as L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi as well as Ashok Singhal and Vishnu Hari Dalmia of the VHP.

 The law board will also take up for detailed consideration a report on Babri Masjid cases prepared by Zafaryab Jilani, a senior advocate of Lucknow, before finalising a decision on how to expedite them.

 The cases include those on the title deed of the disputed structure and the criminal cases arising out of its demolition on December 6, 1992.

 The law board panels report on a bill proposed by the National Women Commission on compulsory registration of all marriages would also be discussed, Qureshi said.

 Stating that such compulsory registration was not practical in a country like India, law board president Maulana Mohammad Rabe Hasan Nadvi and Qureshi said the law board cannot compromise on the Shariat.

 They also iterated their opposition to a uniform civil code.

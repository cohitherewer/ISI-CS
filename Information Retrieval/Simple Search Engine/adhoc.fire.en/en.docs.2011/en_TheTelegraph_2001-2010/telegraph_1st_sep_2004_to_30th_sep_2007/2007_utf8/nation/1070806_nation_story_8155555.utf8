 Al Qaida makes India a legitimate target

 Osama bin Laden

 Dubai, Aug. 5 (AFP): Al Qaida has warned in a new video that India and US diplomatic missions were the terror networks legitimate targets.

 In the footage compiled by al Qaidas production arm As-Sahab, a narrator said the targeting of Tel Aviv, Moscow and Delhi is also our legitimate right and accused India of killing more than 100,000 Muslims in Kashmir with US blessing.

 It also singled out US missions in oil-rich Gulf states as potential targets.

 We shall continue to target you at home and abroad just as you target us at home and abroad, Adam Gadahn, a wanted American member of al Qaida, said in the video.

 Gadahn, who is believed to be in Pakistan, carries a $1-million reward for his capture and he appears along with Osama bin Laden on a US wanted poster featuring 26 faces of global terrorism.

 The video was posted on lauramansfield.com, an American website that monitors terror groups.

 These spy dens and military command and control centres from which you plotted your aggression against Afghanistan and Iraq, and which still provide vital moral, military, material, and logistical support to the crusade, shall continue to be legitimate targets for brave Muslims... unless you heed our demands, Gadahn, an American convert to Islam who has been indicted for treason in the US, said.

 Stop the crusade and leave the Muslims alone, he added.

 In a message to the Americans and their crusader allies, Gadahn said: The amount of respect we have for your international law is even less than the respect you hold for Shariat, and our observance of it is comparable to your observance of Shariat.

 How can we comply with a law which contradicts divine law in whole and in part? Gadahn asked.

 How can we recognise a law which states that the embassy or consulate is for all intents and purposes an inviolable fortress which the host country has no right to enter or monitor and when our Shariat commands us to liberate every handspan of Islamic land occupied by the unbelievers?

 The one-hour 17-minute video was shown about two months after Gadahn asked the US in another Internet video to withdraw troops from Muslim land or face attacks worse than that on September 11. 

 The video included clips from old speeches by Osama bin Laden and his right-hand man Ayman al-Zawahiri.

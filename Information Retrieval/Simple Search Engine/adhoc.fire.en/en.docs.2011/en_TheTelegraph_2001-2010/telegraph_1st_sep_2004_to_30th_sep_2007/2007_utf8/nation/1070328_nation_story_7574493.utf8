 Jurassic-era frogs in India face extinction

 Threatened?

 New Delhi, March 27: In the forests of southern India, wildlife scientist Karthikeyan Vasudevan has found evidence for the long-held suspicion that India is losing its frogs, including some whose lineages go back to the Jurassic era.

 Studies by the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehra Dun, scientist have shown that shrinking forests are taking a toll on the variety of species and the density of frogs in patches of forests along the Western Ghats.

 The density of frogs has reduced significantly in these forests because of fragmentation, Vasudevan told a scientific meeting of the Asian chapter of the Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation in Mahabalipuram earlier this month.

 Forests become fragmented when patches are cleared for plantations, said Vasudevan who has been monitoring amphibians in India for the past eight years. Hes counted a variety of frogs and toads wrinkled stream frogs, bush frogs, forest-floor dwelling frogs, and tree-climbing or gliding frogs, among others.

 Scientists expect to find about 150 frogs per hectare in undisturbed forests, but the number has dropped to about 80 in small forest patches. 

 One set of studies in the Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve and the Annamalai hills in Tamil Nadu has suggested that fragments of forests smaller than 50 hectares are the worst affected and offer little hope of retaining their frog populations.

 Some of the threatened frogs are relics of ancient lineages that date back to 160 million years the Jurassic era, Vasudevan said. Two such species are Indirana brachytarsus and Nyctibatrachus beddomeie.

 The loss of frogs could cause insects to resurge, he said. Frogs are voracious insect eaters with some frogs eating up to 50 insects in a single day and help maintain a balance in the population of insects.

 Scientists have cautioned they do not have enough information about the role of frogs in the ecosystem to predict the impact of a massive decline in the number of frogs. 

 Many natural extinctions have taken place in the past, but human-caused extinctions are far too rapid for evolution to compensate, said Ravi Chellam, director of the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment, Bangalore.

 An international team of scientists had reported two years ago that 122 species of amphibians have disappeared from different parts of the world since 1980 and 1,856 of the total known 5,743 amphibian species are endangered.

 Amphibians are highly sensitive to changes in the habitat, said Priya Davidar, Indian representative of the Asian chapter of the Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation. 

 Studies from elsewhere have shown that frogs and toads may be in greater danger than birds and mammals.

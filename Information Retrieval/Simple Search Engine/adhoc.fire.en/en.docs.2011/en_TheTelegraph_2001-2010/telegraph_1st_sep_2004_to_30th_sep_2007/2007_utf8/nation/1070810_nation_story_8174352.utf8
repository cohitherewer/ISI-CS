 McNugget? Its the name that tastes best

 Aug. 9: Marketing managers always thought they knew better than Shakespeare. Now theres scientific proof that packaging is everything and a McNugget by any other name just doesnt taste as good.

 A group of children handed food samples from McDonalds preferred the taste of those wrapped in the fast-food chains familiar golden arches to identical samples in unmarked paper packaging. 

 The experiment, conducted on 63 children aged three to five, proves that even the very young are swayed by brand preferences.

 Kids dont just ask for food from McDonalds, said Thomas Robinson of Lucille Packard Childrens Hospital, which carried out the study jointly with the Stanford University School of Medicine.

 They actually believe that the chicken nugget they think is from McDonalds tastes better than an identical, unbranded nugget.

 How strongly the children preferred the right wrapping correlated with the number of TV sets they had at home and how often they ate at McDonalds.

 While the findings show that companies bombarding kids with advertisements on food, beverage, clothes and toys on TV know what they are doing, they are likely to fuel debate on the practice. 

 In the US, where obesity rates are rising even among under-eights, there is likely to be greater pressure on food and beverage companies to cut back on marketing to children. 

 Its really an unfair marketplace out there for young children, said Robinson, the lead author of the research, published in the of Pediatrics amp; Adolescent Medicine. Its very clear they cannot understand the persuasive nature of advertising.

 Dont blame just the kids, though. Cheeky tests show that adults are no better. The literary world made a mockery of Shakespeares lines: Whats in a name? That which we call a rose/By any other name would smell as sweet.

 In January last year, a newspaper sent the opening chapters of two Booker prize-winning novels to 20 London agents and publishers, pretending they were from manuscripts by new writers and seeking a publishing contract. One of the novels was Stanley Middletons Holiday, from 1974; the other V.S. Naipauls 1971 In A Free State.

 Many didnt reply at all, and the ones that did mostly rejected both. Nobody recognised either writer.

 Governor probe calms art varsity

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, July 13: Gujarat governor Nawal Kishore Sharma has stepped into the M.S. University row over an obscene art exhibition, and the campus is showing signs of returning to normality.

 Fine arts students have called off their 64-day agitation against the suspension of dean Shivaji Panikkar. Deepak Kannan, who had replaced him but put in his papers last week, withdrew his resignation today. 

 Sharma, in his capacity as Visitor to MSU, yesterday appointed a fact-finding committee to probe the May 9 attack on the exhibition. Right-wing activists led by the BJPs Niraj Jain had vandalised controversial paintings that featured gods and goddesses.

 Fine arts student Chandramohan, whose works had been targeted, was arrested and Panikkar suspended for refusing to close the exhibition.

 Economist Y.K. Alagh will head the panel that will have Gujarat University vice-chancellor Sudarshan Iyengar and painter Haku Shah as its members. Shah is an alumnus of the fine arts faculty.

 Kannan and Panikkar called this a positive development. The faculty echoed them. We are confident that it will be a stepping stone to a deeper inquiry that is required, said teacher Iftakar Ahmed.

 Minority loan push to banks

 New Delhi, July 20: The finance ministry has called a meeting of chief executives of banks to persuade them to increase lending to members of minority communities.

 The meeting slated for August 1 with finance minister P. Chidambaram and top North Block mandarins will review the performance of banks as well as seek to increase lending to minority businesses in 121 districts identified as having significant minority population. 

 Calcutta, Howrah, central Delhi, Lucknow and Bhopal figure in the list of priority districts where the government wants banks to increase both lending and the number of branches in minority areas. 

 Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Assam top the list of states that have districts with minority concentration. 

 The Congress-led government has been pushing for greater financial assistance to the minorities, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes ever since it came to power. 

 These groups have traditionally been part of the ruling alliances support base. 

 A committee set up by the government and headed by Justice Rajinder Sachar had looked into the socio-economic and educational backwardness of Muslims across the country and suggested various remedies, which included attempts at financial inclusion and reservation in the security forces. 

 Two months ago, the Reserve Bank of India had also told bankers that they should increase lending to minority communities as part of priority sector lending. 

 Banks allow such lending to financially disadvantaged people like farmers, artisans, SC/ST businessmen and women. It follows the US example of positive discrimination in favour of the Black community.

 However, many believe the move violates a code drawn up by the RBI which states that banks will not discriminate on the basis of age, race, gender, marital status, religion or disability. 

 The Centres policy of reservation for SC/STs, OBCs and minorities in commercial contracts has been questioned by the Supreme Court. 

 The apex court has asked the government to explain why preferential treatment was being accorded to them in awarding railway catering tenders.

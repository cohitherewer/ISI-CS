 First blow to Valley truce

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Jammu, Jan. 17: Pakistani troops opened fire to help a group of militants intruding into Indian territory, violating a three-year-old ceasefire along the Jammu and Kashmir border.

 The incident, which occurred at Matkulla post in Akhnoor, 50 km from Jammu, early this morning involved eight to 10 militants. The sneak-in bid was foiled, but two Border Security Force jawans were injured in the crossfire.

 It is the first violation of ceasefire in three years on the international border in Jammu and Kashmir, said BSF additional DIG (Jammu) K.S. Chauhan.

 The ceasefire along the LoC and the 198-km border in Jammu and Kashmir has been effective since November 26, 2003. The Pakistani rangers supported them (the militants) by giving them cover-fire. The Pakistani troops opened heavy fire on our soldiers at Matkulla, Chauhan said.

 TNT haul near Mumbai station

 Mumbai: A day before the city will host the Mumbai Marathon, police seized 6.5 kg of the highly explosive Trinitrotoluene (TNT) near Andheri railway station on Friday night and arrested four persons.

 Mumbai police chief Anami Roy, however, ruled out any link between the seizure and the alert the city had received about a possible terror strike on Republic Day. 

 Acting on information that a group might try to sell an explosive substance, a special squad led by encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma laid a trap near Andheri railway station around midnight. A woman, Sakhubai Gaikwad, 45, and Gautam Telore, 42, arrived near the station and waited near a BEST bus stop. 

 The police team sent constable Desai as a buyer to the two. Desai handed over a plastic bag containing bogus and genuine currency to Gaikwad. Following a signal from Desai, the police team swooped on the duo.

 Additional commissioner (western region) Bipin Bihari said this was the biggest haul of TNT in the city. The police were checking if the explosive was stolen from the armys training centre at Deolali in Nashik, he added.

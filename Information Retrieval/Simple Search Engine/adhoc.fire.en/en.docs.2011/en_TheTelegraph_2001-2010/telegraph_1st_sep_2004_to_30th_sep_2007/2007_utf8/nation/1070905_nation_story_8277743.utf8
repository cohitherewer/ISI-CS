 Lucknow, Sept. 4: A neighbour suspected to have raped and murdered a three-year-old girl was dragged out of his home and lynched before polices eyes in Lucknow this morning.

 Shiv Mohan, whom the girl called uncle, had lured her into his home last evening with the offer of a bar of chocolate. Around 9am today, more than 12 hours after she had disappeared, her naked body was found in the bathroom of the 30-year-old carpenters house.

 The man appears to have been a paedophile. He was convicted of raping a 12-year-old girl five years ago. But he got bail after three years when he appealed in the high court, said Chiranjeev Sinha, Lucknow circle inspector.

 Officers said the lynching reflected public anger at the increasing instances of child abuse in the state, capped by the discovery of the bones of 20 children at a Noida house last December.

 A crowd of 1,000 people had gathered around Shiv Mohans house. They refused to hand him over to the police and beat him with sticks and stones till he died, said A.K. Jain, inspector-general of police, Lucknow range.

 He said Riyas father Ratnesh Singh had received a call in the morning. The caller said his daughter was safe and would return home in the evening.

 The call was traced to Shiv Mohans house. He obviously wanted to mislead the girls family. He is suspected to have raped the baby before murdering her, Jain said.

 A constable who reached the house, where the unmarried carpenter lived with his 68-year-old blind mother, found the girls body. As the news spread, people of the locality gathered in large numbers.

 According to a survey by the Union government, some 55.73 per cent of boys and 44.27 per cent of girls under five years face sexual abuse in Uttar Pradesh.

 The National Survey on Child Abuse particularly mentions nine states, including Bihar, where the figure for boys is 52.96 per cent and for girls, 47.04 per cent. Across India, more than a fifth of all children are victims.

 The police point to the vagueness of the child abuse laws. A senior officer cited a case where the appeals court witnessed hairs being split on whether a seven-year-old girl could be said to possess modesty that could be outraged.

 The punishment, too, is too light, officials said. If the abuse falls short of physical rape, the maximum sentence is two years. For rape, it is seven years.

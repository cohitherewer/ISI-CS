 Chandigarh, May 15: The nectar of humanitarianism is threatening to rip apart Punjabs secular fabric.

 Furious Sikhs and followers of an influential sect comprising Sikhs and non-Sikhs clashed for the second day over an advertisement showing the groups head dressed as Guru Gobind Singh and preparing amrit, to be distributed among followers.

 The ad released by the Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda, which sparked clashes in Bathinda and left at least 20 injured since yesterday, also issued a code of conduct different from Sikh tenets, claiming it would revive humanitarianism among the masses. 

 The Sikh religion forbids depiction of any living man or woman as any of the 10 gurus.

 The Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, which maintains gurdwaras in Punjab and other parts of the country, has termed the advertisement offensive.

 Guru Gobind Singh began the ritual of giving nectar to baptise Sikhs or others who chose to become Sikhs. The people will retaliate if someone else starts considering himself to be the guru, an SGPC spokesperson said.

 The Akal Takht, the highest Sikh temporal body, also voiced anger. At a meeting today in Amritsar, it, however, appealed for peace. We appeal to all sections to remain calm, head priest Joginder Vedanti said.

 Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, whose depiction as the tenth Sikh guru triggered the violence, defended the advertisement, saying he was only working towards making a human being better. If somebody drinks the offering and becomes a better human being, humanity would be the gainer, he said.

 Yesterday, Dera followers who had gathered at the Bathinda local administration office to protest government apathy, clashed with Sikhs who had assembled at a nearby gurdwara to burn an effigy of Gurmeet. 

 The Dera followers had come with sticks and iron rods, a district official said.

 Today, apart from the violence in Bathinda where the sect has a large following, Sikhs and Dera followers spilled onto the streets of Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Moga, Patiala, Mansa, Sangrur and Muktsar.

 In Amritsar, followers of the Damdami Taksal, a Sikh seminary, brandished swords and shouted pro-Khalistan slogans to protest against the advertisement.

 The Dera has a strong following in Punjab and played a vital role in ensuring that the Congress was not decimated in the February state polls. 

 It had issued a diktat to followers to vote for the party at the request of then chief minister Amarinder Singh, allegedly with an offer to bail out Gurmeet who is facing a CBI probe into allegations of murders and sexual exploitation of women followers.

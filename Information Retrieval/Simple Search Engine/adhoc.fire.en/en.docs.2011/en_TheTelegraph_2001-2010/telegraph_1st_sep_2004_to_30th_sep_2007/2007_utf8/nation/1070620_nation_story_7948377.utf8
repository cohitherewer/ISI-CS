 London, June 19: It is like the beauty contests of a few years ago. Put an Indian girl in and she wins. The same now with books. An Indian author only has to contest to win. 

 Last night, in London it was an Indian journalist from America who walked away with non-fictions richest prize, worth 30,000, for doing a Michael Moore-type demolition job on American (mis)rule in Baghdad. 

 Judging by all the anti-American stuff Rajiv Chandrasekaran has revealed, one hopes for the authors sake that his residence status in America is secure. 

 Commenting on the book, Imperial Life in the Emerald City (published in the UK by Bloomsbury; 12.99), the New York Times Book Review called it: Absolutely brilliant. It is eyewitness history of the first order. It should be read by anyone who wants to understand how things went so badly wrong in Iraq. 

 This is generous praise, considering Chandrasekaran works for the opposition newspaper, The Washington Post, as an assistant managing editor. 

 From a shortlist of six up for the Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction for 2007, managed by the BBC Four television network, Chandrasekaran was named the winner at a dinner at the Savoy Hotel. 

 Chandrasekaran told the Bloomberg agency: This was a total shock. I just got married and my wife and I finished our honeymoon late Saturday night, so I told her to rest at home in Washington while I went off to be a finalist. 

 He added that he never went to Iraq with the intention of writing a book. I went to run the Washington Posts bureau in Baghdad. As I witnessed first hand the degree to which the US failed to plan and then commit the adequate resources to reconstructing Iraq, it became clear to me that I had to write this book, I had to tell the story of what happened during those crucial first 15 months. 

 Perhaps one day, Chandrasekaran will share with other journalists how he managed as the Baghdad bureau chief of his paper to file daily on a fast-moving story and yet have time to gather material for a book. But he did manage to make a note of many of the absurdities of American life transplanted in the middle of a war zone. 

 The author, who now lives in Washington DC, was his papers bureau chief in Baghdad from April 2003 to October 2004, responsible for covering the American occupation of Iraq and supervising a team of Washington Post correspondents. He lived in Baghdad for six months before the war, reporting on the UN weapons-inspection process and the build-up to the conflict. 

 He has now exposed the US aide who based Baghdads new traffic laws on those of the state of Maryland, downloaded from the Internet; the contractor with no previous experience who was paid millions to guard a closed airport; the people with prior experience in the Middle East who were excluded in favour of lesser-qualified Republican Party loyalists; the 24-year-old who had never worked in finance yet was put in charge of revitalising Baghdads stock exchange.

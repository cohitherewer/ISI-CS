The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Sena in President dilemma

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 16: On Friday, the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna headlined the news of Pratibha Patils presidential candidature as Historic moment, Marathi President. 

 But today, the editorial in the Bal Thackeray-edited paper was ambiguous about the partys stand. It said: Though the Shiv Sena had adopted the Hindutva ideology, it has never abandoned the Marathi asmita (pride), and in Pratibha Patil, a Maharashtrian would have the privilege to become the President. 

 The media is now concerned about the Marathi pride. But when we raise the banner of Marathi pride, these people oppose us, the editorial said. We will take a decision after considering what is in the interest of the nation as well as Maharashtra.

 Since Patil emerged as the UPA presidential nominee, the Shiv Sena, a key NDA constituent, has been in a dilemma over whether to support the candidature or remain true to its stand of encouraging the appointment of Maharashtrians in top positions. If it supports Patil, it is certain to upset the BJP. 

 Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray went into a huddle at his residence last night with son Uddhav and senior Sena leaders like former Lok Sabha Speaker Manohar Joshi.

 After the meeting, Joshi said: Though we discussed the issue in detail and arrived at an informal understanding at the meeting, Balasaheb will make a formal announcement about our partys stand on June 19, the partys foundation day.

 Maoist four surrender

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, March 25: Four Maoist leaders, including a kingpin alleged to have staged a dramatic 2004 jailbreak in neighbouring Orissa, laid down their arms today.

 Merugu Sambaiah, 55, Durgam Ramanaiah, 30, his wife Bellamkonda Sarakka alias Kala, 24, and Dara Saraiah alias Sekhar, 30, surrendered this morning before Warangal superintendent of police Soumya Mishra. 

 Ramanaiah, who had escaped from Koraput jail, and Sambaiah were carrying a reward of Rs 2 lakh each on their heads. 

 Ramanaiah said he wasnt in good health and had to look after ageing parents. 

 Sambaiah spoke of his disillusionment with the way Maoists had lost touch with the masses. The top leaders are under an illusion. The masses are not with the party now.

 Ramanaiah, an arms instructor holding training camps until two months ago, hails from Warangal. He had been focusing on Bastar (Chhattisgarh) and the Andhra-Orissa border. 

 Sambaiah, a colleague of PWG founder Kondapalli Seetaramaiah and associated with the movement since 1975, also belongs to Warangal. He went underground in 1980 and was shifted two years later to Bastar, where he was working as an area commander. 

 Ramanaiahs wife Kala conducted training camps for the women members of Chaitanya Natya Manch, a Maoist cultural troupe.

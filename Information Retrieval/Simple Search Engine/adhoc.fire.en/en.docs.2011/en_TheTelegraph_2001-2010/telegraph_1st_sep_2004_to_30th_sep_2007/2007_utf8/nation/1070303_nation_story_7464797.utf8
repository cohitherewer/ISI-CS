 Jamshedpur, March 2: Tata Steel boss B. Muthuraman was at the wheel of his Merc, with group chairman Ratan Tata by his side and two guests from Britain in the back seat.

 Jim Leng and Philippe Varin, the chairman and CEO of Corus Group Plc, the company Tata Steel took over in India Inc.s largest overseas acquisition, were given a tour of Jamshedpur today. Corus shareholders are expected to stamp their seal on the deal by next Wednesday. 

 This wasnt the first time they were in the Steel City Leng and Varin had made a secret tour about a year ago. 

 I came as a innocent man, Leng smiled, asked about his last visit. 

 Jamshedpur will celebrate Founders Day tomorrow the birth anniversary of Tata Group founder Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata. The programmes lined up tomorrow will set the stage for year-long festivities because Tata Steel and the city turn 100 on August 26. 

 Leng took in an exhibition on Jamsetji Tata which he had inaugurated earlier and stopped at the last leg, showcasing Tata Steels latest victory the takeover of Corus. Will there be a whole new panel on Corus the next time we come here? joked the man who will be deputy chairman of Tata-Corus.

 The $11.3-billion acquisition took Tata Steel from 56 to five in the world ranking of steelmakers with an increased capacity of 23.5 million tonnes a year.

 The exhibition was titled Celebrating Globalism A Tribute to the Founder.

 The guests had arrived from Mumbai in the afternoon with Tata, and appeared to be hitting it off well with him. Leng suggested the four including Muthuraman hold hands as they had done on October 20 when Tata Steel and Corus agreed to a buyout before CSN came and rocked the boat for a while. They also signed autographs by the dozen.

 Arun Gandhi the groups head of mergers and acquisitions who took the Corus deal through a nail-biting 12 rounds of bidding in January was there, too.

 Jubilee Park opened 50 years ago on the citys golden jubilee was lit up today. Later, the celebrations were wrapped up with a fireworks display at Beldih Golf Course.

 The visitors seemed to like what they saw in Jamshedpur, where the crowds were out in full strength. 

 There is space for gods, too, Leng quipped while reading about churches in the city. He described his experience at Jubilee Park as staggering.

 Tata would only say: I am very proud to be an Indian.

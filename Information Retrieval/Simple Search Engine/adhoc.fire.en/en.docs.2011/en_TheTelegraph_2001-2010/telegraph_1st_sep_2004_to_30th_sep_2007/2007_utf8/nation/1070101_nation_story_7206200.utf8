 Keep the prosperity curve going: PM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Manmohan Singh

 New Delhi, Dec. 31: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today asked people to sustain the upward curve of prosperity in 2007 while expressing confidence in the countrys economic development on the eve of New Year.

 The New Year gives us an opportunity to dedicate ourselves to the consolidation of gains of the past and work for new horizons of progress and development, Singh said. 

 India enters 2007 with a sense of confidence and purpose, he said, adding that economic prosperity should be inclusive and must not ignore the underprivileged and weaker sections.

 We need to sustain the upward curve of economic prosperity, which should be inclusive and bring succour to the underprivileged and weaker sections of society. 

 Singh also greeted Muslims on the eve of Id-ul-Zoha, saying Hazrat Ibrahims shining example of selfless sacrifice should inspire everyone to subordinate self-interest for the greater good of humankind.

 Id epitomises the spirit of sacrifice and sharing, he said, adding that it is an occasion to reaffirm our responsibility towards the less privileged sections of our society. 

 In his New Year message, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam exhorted people to spread happiness everywhere by helping the needy. 

 On the occasion of New Year, I extend my greetings and best wishes to all my people in India and abroad, he said. 

 In his message for Id, Kalam said it is indeed a day of remembrance of the great sacrifice and a thanksgiving day to the Almighty who has bestowed everything on humanity.

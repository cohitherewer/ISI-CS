NATION BRIEFS

 Chennai, Aug. 26: Four pilgrims died and two were injured in a ropeway accident in the temple town of Palani on Sunday.

 The crash occurred when the hook of a cable-car gliding up the hill shrine came off the cable, sending it crashing into another car down the rope. Under the impact, the second car plunged 40 feet and smashed into a rock.

 All four victims were in the second car.

 Power to the ropeway was switched off and over 20 pilgrims stuck in other cable-cars were rescued with the help of police and fire-brigade personnel. 

 The ropeway with 14 cable cars was built by a Calcutta firm over a year ago to help manage the rising number of pilgrims at the shrine, 425km from Chennai.

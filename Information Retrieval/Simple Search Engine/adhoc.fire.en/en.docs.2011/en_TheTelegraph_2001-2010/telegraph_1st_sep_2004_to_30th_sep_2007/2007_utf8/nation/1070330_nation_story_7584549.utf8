 Venugopal verdict

 New Delhi, March 29 (PTI): Delhi High Court today ruled that AIIMS chief P. Venugopal, a heart surgeon, cannot hold two posts and terminated his position as professor in the cardiology department. 

 The verdict came on petitions filed by the NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation and the government.

 However, it said the directive will come into effect after two weeks. The court also held that Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss could be nominated to the governing body of the institute.

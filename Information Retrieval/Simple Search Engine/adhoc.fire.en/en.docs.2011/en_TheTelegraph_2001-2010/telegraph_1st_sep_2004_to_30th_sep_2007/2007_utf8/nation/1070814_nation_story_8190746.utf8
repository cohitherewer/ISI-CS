 LK dials, PK picks up 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 (Top) Advani, Karat

 New Delhi, Aug. 13: The BJP today sought to pull off a coup of sorts in the season of posturing by seeking cooperation from the Left in blocking the nuclea r deal.

 Opposition leader L.K. Advani called up CPM general secretary Prakash Karat this morning and sought a concerted drive against the deal.

 Any floor coordination is far-fetched sources said the BJP leader was told the Left would have its own tactics but this is the first formal conversation between two leaders at two extreme ends of the political spectrum.

 A few days ago, it was unthinkable that Advani would dial Karat and the CPM leader would pick up the line. 

 But such is the level of posturing that everybody has jumped into the nuclear pond to fish in troubled waters.

 It remains to be seen how far the BJP itself will go in opposing the deal as some NDA stalwarts were kept in the picture while negotiations were going on in the US. Perhaps, Advani called Karat certain of a Left cold-shoulder, which would help the BJP claim that the party was willing to go the extra mile to block the deal but the others were reluctant.

 Advani told Karat that the NDA had sent a fresh notice to the Speaker for a debate under Rule 184 which entails voting and the Left should extend support in national interest.

 Karat is learnt to have said he was out of Delhi for some days and will have to update himself on the issue. But he did ask Advani to send the copy of the draft. 

 Advani said he had sent a copy to Basudev Acharya, the CPM leader in the Lok Sabha. Sources said BJP leader Sushma Swaraj also had a meeting with CPM Rajya Sabha MP Brinda Karat and requested her to back the Opposition on the nuclear deal.

 Brinda, sources said, was not averse to the idea of blocking the deal and did not rule out acceptance of voting either. 

 The Speaker had rejected the earlier notices for a debate under Rule 184 as the language made it hard for him to accept them. The notices had sought ratification of the deal in Parliament for which there is no constitutional provision. But the fresh notices only ask the government to renegotiate the deal.

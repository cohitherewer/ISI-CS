 Heavenly wedding busies Sun City

 Jodhpur, March 8: Sun City seems to be slowly waking up to Liz as a business opportunity. Local brands want that push from her. 

 Opposite Umaid Bhavan Palace, the heritage hotel where the couple and their guests are staying, is a cluster of Rajasthani art emporiums and export houses. On one such, on the seventh floor of Rani Handicrafts Private Limited, hangs a large sign welcoming Liz and Arun.

 We just wanted to honour the couple, says Ashok Khurana, manager. We also know we could promote ourselves this way, he says. Well be very glad if Liz Hurley drops in but she may not get the time. Ye business kum publicity zyada hai (less business, more publicity).

 The nearby Gems and Art Plaza, too, has something similar in mind. The shop, which specialises in kundan jewellery, has selected some pieces for Liz in case she visits. 

 The local emporiums could have got the message from Liz herself. She has got good deals by selling herself as a brand puller: a free wedding venue in Gloucestershire and a 1-million deal with Hello magazine for exclusive wedding reportage. Stepping down from Vijay Mallyas Kingfisher Airlines flight could also be called a form of brand promotion. 

 Not just the emporiums. We got a call from Umaid Bhavan, says Arvind Singh of Rajasthan Safa House, which sells banaye-huye safa (pagri), readymade dhoti, kameez and other wedding gear. 

 Its a busy day, winding lengths of nine-metre bandhni or saffron cotton into turbans. He has supplied 125 of these saffron pagris to Liz and Nayar to be worn by their guests at the wedding ceremony tomorrow. Each pagri costs only Rs 250 but hes a celebrated name today in his biradari.

 In another part of the city, Pappu jootiwala is a famous man. He has fitted out many celebrities, including Sachin Tendulkar, but has also supplied about 200 pairs of mojris to Umaid Bhavan. 

 His claim is contested by another jooti seller. In that case, I must say that my brother also worked on tabletops at Umaid Bhavan Palace. Rivalry is brewing.

 The wedding show suffered a slight setback today. Bollywood landed in Jodhpur with overzealous photographers pouncing on Preity Zinta who staged a dance performance for the couple. Securitymen beat reporters up and a scuffle followed.

 At Jodhpur, more guests trickled in, including designer Rohit Bal and socialite Parmeshwar Godrej. Industrialist Gautam Singhania, who arrived yesterday, was sighted landing again today. He apparently went to a breakfast in Agra.

 Tomorrow, there will be three pundits conducting the marriage ceremony, one of whom will translate the mantras into English.

 Liz had selected the overall theme of the wedding: marriage in heaven.

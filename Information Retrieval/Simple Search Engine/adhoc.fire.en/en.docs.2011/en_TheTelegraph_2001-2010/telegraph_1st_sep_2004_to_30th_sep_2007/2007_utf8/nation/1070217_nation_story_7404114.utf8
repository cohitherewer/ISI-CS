 Delhi fast lane for research visas

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Feb. 16: Delhi will soon empower its ambassadors and high commissioners to grant one-time five-year research visas to foreign scholars, speeding up a process often seen as slow and overcautious by governments abroad.

 A research co-ordination committee (RCC) of senior officials is trying to sift innocuous research subjects from the potentially troublesome, and friendly countries from the rest.

 When both lists are drawn up, they will serve as a ready reckoner for the Indian envoys abroad as they hand out quick research visas through what will be called the green channel.

 Controversial subjects and areas of research, and countries that cannot be termed friendly, will be placed in the red channel, marked out for thorough scrutiny of applications.

 Applicants, however, will be given a time-bound clearance or rejection, a senior official said.

 US ambassador David Mulford had recently accused India of not being very welcoming to American students.

 He said the visas of several students on Fulbright scholarships had been pending for the past six to nine months.

 Government sources denied that the research visa regime had been fast-tracked because of US pressure.

 The RCC, which will meet once a month to clear the backlog of research visa applications, cleared 558 of the 926 pending applications at its last two sittings, a source said.

 Only 15 were rejected and of them, eight were from Fulbright scholars.

 The source added that of the 926 proposals, 76 were from Fulbright scholars.

 The RCC has decided to also give foreign researchers a one-time grace period of six months after the expiry of their five-year visa to allow them to complete formalities, such as receiving their certificate.

 The RCC, headed by the Union human resource development secretary, is being assisted by senior officials from the foreign and home ministries, the Indian Council of Historical Research and the department of agricultural research and education.

 All higher education-related departments are co-ordinating with the committee to demarcate the subjects. The details of the system are being drawn up and would be put before the Union cabinet soon, sources said.

 Foreign researchers already working in India, too, will get a concession. They can get their extensions from the local foreign regional registration offices instead of travelling all the way to Delhi.

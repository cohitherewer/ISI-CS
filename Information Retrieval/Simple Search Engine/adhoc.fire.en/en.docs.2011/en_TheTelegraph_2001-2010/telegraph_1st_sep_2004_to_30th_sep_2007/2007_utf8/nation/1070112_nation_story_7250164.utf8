 Calcuttas Presidency College: Grand old age of 150

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: This year marks the 150th anniversary of the 1857 revolt. But the British who crushed that uprising also laid the foundation of the university system the same year. 

 The universities in the Presidency towns of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras came up. The National of India is celebrating 150 years of that legacy. Other institutions like the Calcutta Madarsa (1781) and Benaras Hindu College (1792) had also been set up during the Raj, but these were largely the result of individual initiatives.

 The three universities, modelled on the University of London, were set up with British interests in mind, but they sent out graduates who began leading the freedom struggle.

 These are the twists and turns in history, said Planning Commission member Bhalchandra Mungekar today as he inaugurated an exhibition of records to mark 150 years of the Presidency universities. Calcutta, Mumbai and Chennai will hold the exhibition after January 31.

 Many institutions of higher education have come up after Independence, but the pre-eminence of the three universities hasnt diminished. A tenth of all graduates still come from these universities and their affiliated colleges, though the country now has 350 universities and 1,700 colleges. 

 On display at the exhibition are blow-ups of faded certificates given out in the early years of the Presidency universities, including one handed by University of Bombay to one S. K. Nariman on January 7, 1888.

 Yellowing pages from the Charters and Regulations of the London University a blueprint that served as the foundation of the three universities are also on display.

 Also grabbing attention are the words of H. H. Wilson, Oxfords first Sanskrit professor and the first English translator of the Rig Veda, before a House of Lords committee in 1854. I do not know what is meant by a university in India; if it is to consist in wearing caps and gowns, and being called Bachelors of Arts and Masters of Arts, I do not see what advantage is likely to accrue from it.

 There are documents that detail British initiatives made before the Presidency universities were set up. One of them is a provision in the Charter Act of 1813 allocating Rs 1 lakh for the development of educational institutes.

 Also featured is a minute by Bengal governor Warren Hastings supporting the establishment of a madarsa in Calcutta. It says: An institution for 100 scholars would cost the exchequer Rs 10,000 per month at the utmost.

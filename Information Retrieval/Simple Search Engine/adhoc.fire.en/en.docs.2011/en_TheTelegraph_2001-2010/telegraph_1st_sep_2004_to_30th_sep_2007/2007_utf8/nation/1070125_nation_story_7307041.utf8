 Night trial for office-goers

 BASANT RAWAT

 Ahmedabad, Jan. 24: Its 6.30 pm, time for Nikunj Tapasia to return home from work and put his feet up.

 But last Friday, the computer engineer headed straight from his office to the Ahmedabad rural court, where his case was being heard.

 It was his fourth visit to the court since night courts were set up in Gujarat on November 14 last year the first experiment in the country to allow people like Tapasia to attend proceedings after office hours.

 The case against Tapasia he had grievously injured a man in an accident three years ago had been dragging on, forcing him to repeatedly take time off work to be present at court. But for the last four hearings, he hasnt been complaining.

 Earlier, I had to apply for casual leave whenever I was summoned by the court. But ever since my case was transferred to a night court, I have been to coming to court after my work hours, he said.

 An hour after he had walked in, a cheerful Tapasia emerged from the courtroom, saying he had been acquitted. Decisions in the night courts seem to be faster. Now I dont have to suffer any more.

 The objective behind starting courts that would function for an additional two hours, from 6.15 pm to 8.15 pm, was to speed up disposal of cases as well as to help working people. Thirty-one lakh cases are pending in Gujarat, state law minister Ashok Bhatt said.

 The idea was mooted by Narendra Modi in 2005 at a meeting of chief ministers, high court chief justices and Supreme Court judges.

 Later, the state law department, in consultation with the Gujarat High Court chief justice, formed the Evening Courts Rules, 2006. All the judges and judicial staff in the 42 night courts in seven districts are paid 25 per cent extra.

 For starters, these courts are dealing with about 20,000 petty cases relating to family and property disputes, dowry, liquor ban violations and accidents. One such court has just resolved a one-and-a-half-year-old marriage dispute.

 Priti Shah, a 24-year-old executive with a leading private bank, was being blackmailed by a TV artiste who claimed to be her husband. He had managed to get a marriage certificate from a Mumbai court.

 Pritis counsel Deepak Shah said the self-proclaimed husband had been asking for money to agree to a divorce. The court ruled in favour of Priti.

 The night courts have been a success, senior counsel Arvind Pandya said. Not only the litigants and defendants but the junior advocates, too, are happy. They are excited by the chance to handle the cases. Senior lawyers only deal with serious cases in regular courts.

 Critics say the night courts may be helping office-goers, but they arent enough to clear the backlog. The real solution lies in appointing more judges.

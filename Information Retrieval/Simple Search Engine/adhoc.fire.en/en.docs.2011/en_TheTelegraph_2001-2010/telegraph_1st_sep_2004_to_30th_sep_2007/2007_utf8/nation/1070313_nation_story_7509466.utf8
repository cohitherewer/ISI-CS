 Navy date with Japan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 12: A flotilla of the Indian Navy will participate in war games with the Japanese and the US Pacific Command in April in a first of its kind trilateral drill. The Indian Navy flotilla has left for the shores of Japan.

 But the Indian Navy will not participate in a drill with the Chinese with whom elementary military exercises began last year. 

 Apart from mountaineering expeditions that the Indian Army has conducted with help from the Chinese, the navy has held a search and rescue (SAR) drill with the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army Navy (PLA Navy). 

 A navy source said the decision not to have an exercise with the Chinese was not intended to convey a diplomatic snub. Its just that that could not be fit into the schedule, he said.

 The trilateral naval exercise is to take place even as Mukherjee readies to visit Japan as external affairs minister.

 Chennai on toes after Bengal SEZ tryst

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Chennai, March 21: The Nandigram violence has put the DMK government in Tamil Nadu on guard with chief minister M. Karunanidhi declaring that mischievous propaganda against special economic zones would not be tolerated.

 We will implement the suggestion mooted by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam that SEZs should be developed on wastelands to the maximum extent possible so that arable lands are not disturbed, Kar-unanidhi (in picture) told a news conference today. 

 In the same breath, the chief minister warned that anyone carrying on a calculated or motivated campaign aga-inst the very creation of SEZs will be dealt with as per law.

 Karunanidhi quoted Kalam as saying there are about 15 crore acres of wasteland in the country that could be utilised to develop SEZs. The DMK concurs with the Presidents views in full, he said.

 Referring to agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathans appeal yesterday to create agriculture-related SEZs to help retain prime plots and highly productive farmland for agriculture, Karunanidhi said it was a good suggestion and a possible way out of the SEZ impasse.

 But one cannot say do not set up industries at all. India is an agriculture-based country and both have to coexist. Its equally important to note that water is necessary to protect agriculture, and with several states deprived of sufficient water for irrigation, the first priority should be to nationalise our rivers, he said. 

 However, the chief minister ruled out fresh talks on the Cauvery row with Karnataka, which has been sulking over getting less river water. He said that with the Cauvery dispute tribunal giving a verdict after 17 years, the situation did not warrant fresh talks.

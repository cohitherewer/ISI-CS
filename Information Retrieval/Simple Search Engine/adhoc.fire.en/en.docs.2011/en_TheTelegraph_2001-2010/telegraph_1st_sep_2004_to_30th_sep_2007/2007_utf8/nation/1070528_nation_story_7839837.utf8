 Crikey, pianists heart is missing!

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, May 27: The broken bones and oozing blood were no problem. What shocked the orthopaedist was that the pianist had no heart.

 The X-ray plate was clear on that point: there was a lung on the left side of Dilip Singh Dodias chest and not much else.

 How can a man survive without a heart, and where was all that blood being pumped out from?

 The 32-year-old pianist had been rushed to the Chahar Trauma Centre in Ratlam, a small town in Madhya Pradesh, after a road accident on Friday.

 The patients right leg had multiple fractures and he needed immediate surgery. So we did the mandatory X-ray on the left of his chest. When I saw the picture, I was in a panic, Dr Yogendra Singh Chahar said.

 The orthopaedist immediately summoned his colleague Dr Ajay Jain. A little bit of exploration and the puzzled frown on the cardiologists face was replaced by a smile.

 Dodia has an extremely rare congenital condition called dextrocardia, in which ones heart is on the right side of the chest instead of the left.

 Jain joked: You might say his heart is in the right place, which may be a good thing for an artiste but a rather nasty surprise for a doctor treating a medical emergency.

 I had read about it in my textbooks but never seen a real-life case, Chahar said. He was unsure whether Dodias dextrocardia is accompanied with situs inversus.

 One problem with having the heart on the right is that the liver, also on the right, might cramp it from below. But in situs inversus, all ones organs switch positions, leaving the chest and abdominal cavities looking like mirror images of those of a normal person.

 Which means the liver and appendix are on the left, and the spleen and the stomach on the right.

 We shall wait till the patient is better before we inspect his abdominal organs, Chahar said.

 Dodia said he and his family had no idea that his heart was on the right side. I never noticed it.

 He said that he had all his life lived in the village of Bakhatgarh in Dhar district, more than 250 km from Bhopal, and had never been examined at a hospital before. 

 I had come to Ratlam to get train reservations for Mumbai, a city to which he travels regularly to play the piano at stage shows.

 Jain said Dodia was in good health and his heart was functioning normally. 

 Dextrocardia happens because of a genetic condition. The embryos primitive heart tube folds in the reverse direction and the hearts apex is positioned on the right, not left.

 One person in 7,500 has dextrocardia with situs inversus while one in 29,000 has dextrocardia in isolation, Jain added. Those with only one of the conditions are likelier to have congenital heart defects than those with both.

 But most patients, with dextrocardia alone or together with situs inversus, lead a normal, healthy life, Jain said.

 The name is derived from the Latin dexter (the right side) and cardio (of the heart).

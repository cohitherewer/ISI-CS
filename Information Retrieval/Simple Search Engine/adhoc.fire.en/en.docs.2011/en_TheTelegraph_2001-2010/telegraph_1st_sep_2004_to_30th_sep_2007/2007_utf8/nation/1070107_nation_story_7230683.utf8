 Bid for trade in BrahMos

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The BrahMos missile 

New Delhi, Jan. 6: India is likely to renew joint efforts with Russia to export the BrahMos missile to third countries despite a protest registered by Moscows state arms export agency at a secretary-level meeting in New Delhi last month.

 The renewal of efforts will coincide with the visit of Russian defence minister Sergei Ivanov to Bangalore and New Delhi. Ivanov will lead a Russian defence team on January 23 and 24 before joining Russian President Vladimir Putin who will be the chief guest at Indias Republic Day ceremonies on January 26.

 Shortly before the joint secretaries of India and Russia met in New Delhi, Rosoboronexport, through which all arms transactions with India are routed, criticised a drive by BrahMos, the anti-ship missile-producing joint venture, for trying to edge Russian missiles out of the market. The BrahMos, named after the Brahmaputra and the Moskva rivers, has been held up on more than one occasion as an ideal for the India-Russia military partnership.

 It was initiated in 1995 by Indias Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russias NPO Mashinostroyna to develop supersonic cruise missiles.

 India has been trying to export the BrahMos to at least five countries. It has made presentations in Malaysia, South Africa, Kuwait, Chile and Indonesia. Indias drive to promote the BrahMos led by the head of the joint venture, missile scientist Sivathanu Pillai is guided by its policy of strengthening defence cooperation with friendly third countries. 

 Rosoboronexport was probably miffed because it apprehended the campaign to sell the 300-km-range BrahMos could tell on its efforts to sell its own missiles to Malaysia. The BrahMos basically an anti-ship missile will also have an air force variant that is in an advanced stage of development. The Indian Navy has already installed the BrahMos system on its warship, the INS Rajput.

 Defence sources said talks on Indian participation in Russias fifth-generation fighter aircraft project were also likely during Ivanovs visit. The Russian defence ministers first halt will be in Bangalore where he is expected to visit the Hindustan Aeronautics facility. Moscow is understood to be insisting on a commitment from India that its air force will buy the fifth-generation aircraft.

 A team of the Indian Air Force and HAL made a presentation on the project to defence minister A.K. Antony recently. The futuristic project is designed to develop an aircraft that is a generation ahead of the Sukhoi 30MKI (now with the Indian Air Force) and rival Americas F-35 joint strike fighter programme.

 Court glare on Pareira let-off 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 19: Bombay High Court today pulled up the prosecution for shoddy handling of the Alistair Pareira case and decided to intervene to find out if the businessmans son had got away lightly after running over seven pavement sleepers.

 A division bench of newly appointed Chief Justice Swatanter Kumar and Justice S.C. Dharmadhikari ordered the Maharashtra government to submit all documents related to the case, including post-mortem, forensic and injury reports.

 In a hard-hitting observation, the bench said there couldnt be a greater slur on the system and issued notices to the state government, Mumbai police and investigating officer S. Phulsundar, asking them to explain the loopholes in the investigation.

 An allegedly drunk Pareira, returning from a party with friends last November, had run over 15 construction labourers sleeping on Carter Road in Bandra, killing seven, including a pregnant woman and two children.

 Last week, a sessions court sentenced him to six months imprisonment for rash and negligent driving as the prosecution failed to prove the more serious charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which could have seen Pareira go behind bars for 10 years. 

 The police couldnt even prove the drunk driving charge.

 The high court today asked why it should not examine the correctness, legality and propriety of findings and judgement of the sessions court. There is a possibility of miscarriage of justice, the bench added and sought a reply by May 3.

 The court placed restrictions on Pareira leaving Mumbai and directed him to surrender his passport.

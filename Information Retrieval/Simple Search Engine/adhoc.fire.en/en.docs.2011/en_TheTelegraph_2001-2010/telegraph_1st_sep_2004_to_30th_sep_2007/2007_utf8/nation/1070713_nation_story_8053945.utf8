The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 The forgotten sale of Gandhi papers

 AMIT ROY 

 A Gandhi letter auctioned by Sothebys and (right) the manuscript Christies returned to India

 London, July 12: Another valuable bundle of Gandhi documents came up for sale, this time at Sothebys, but on this occasion the auction went through today without anyone at India House or anywhere else noticing. 

 A Sothebys spokesman told The Telegraph: Lot number 17 was an autographed manuscript by Gandhi in which he discusses a range of political and cultural subjects. It had a reserve price of 25,0000 to 35,000. 

 It went to a private buyer for 45,600, the spokesman added. 

 This is not the first time that auction of Gandhi memorabilia has come and gone without stirring much interest in India. 

 The auction of Gandhis article in Urdu Harijan at Christies was stopped just before the sale last week after the intervention by the Indian High Commission, acting on instructions from Delhi. 

 This time, it seems no one had looked at the Sothebys catalogue. 

 It contains a long description of the draft with revisions of a series of articles for Young India discussing a range of political and cultural subjects: the caste system. 

 Gandhi is quoted as declaring that untouchability is surely disappearing amp; with its disappearance the way to swaraj is becoming safe and easy. 

 There are also references to the khadi campaign (A mountain of yarn balls and A widows gift); and the effects of the colonial education system, which has emasculated the English educated Indian. 

 Gandhi observed dryly that the process of displacing the vernacular has been one of the saddest chapters in the British connection. 

 There are other references to the ongoing non-violent protest in Mulshi, where villagers were threatened with dispossession from their land; Another Secret treaty, a comment on the secret treaties signed by the British government during World War I; and Too late!, a response to the Tilak Swaraj Fund and a temperance campaign. 

 How this treasure trove slipped through the net unless the private buyer was acting on behalf of the Indian government (which seems unlikely) is a mystery because the catalogue is an easily available public document. 

 There are also 11 autograph letters signed by Gandhi (as MK Gandhi, or Bapu), and one autographed postcard. 

 The bundle comprises six letters to Badrul Hasan, discussing his work for Gandhis campaigns (I am delighted you expect to collect Rs 25,000), his writing (You dont concentrate enough amp; therefore your argument does not flow freely) for Young India, dispensing advice on a range of subjects, and encouraging him to learn Gujarati and traditional spinning. 

 There are also two letters and a postcard to Dr Jafar Hasan, on subjects including the Urdu and Hindi languages (I am the author of the definition of Hindi ... as being that language which is spoken by the Hindus amp; the Muslims of the North amp; written either in Devnagri or Persian script), and his work on Hindi poetry; and three letters to other members of the family, including one letter on the death of Badrul (I loved him as my son. He was a young man of great promise amp; I had built high hopes on him). 

 Another bundle is described thus by Sothebys: 12 autograph letters signed, including letters by: Muhammad Iqbal, praising and discussing Jafar Hasans book on Hindi poetry, in Urdu, 1 page, 1930; Sri Aurobindo, on spiritual matters (These are matters of great delicacy and subtlety which it is difficult to explain in the terms of ordinary experience), 1 page, 24 January 1931, together with notes in Urdu discussing Aurobindo and Mother; Sarojini Naidu, sending condolences, 2 pages, 21 April 1931; and nine other letters in English and Urdu. 

 Sothebys says the documents contain a powerful and vigorous series of articles written during the satyagraha campaign of non-cooperation (1920-22), during a visit to Gujarat in one of Gandhis many pilgrimages through India. 

 Gandhi wrote: There can be no Satyagrah in an unjust cause. Satyagrah in a just cause is vain if the men espousing it are not determined and capable of fighting it and suffering to the end and the slightest use of violence often defeats a just cause. Satyagrah excludes the use of violence in any shape or form whether in thought speech or deed. Given a just cause, capacity of endless suffering and avoidance of violence victory is a certainty. 

 The auction house says: In the piece quoted above, Gandhi draws inspiration from a local campaign by peasants against land dispossession, and scorns any compromise which would disadvantage the poor (I daresay the problem of disease and poverty can be easily solved ... if the decrepit humanity were shot and their bodies utilised for manure.) 

 It also says: Gandhi writes in characteristically moral, uncompromising, and optimistic terms about subjects close to his heart. He is ferocious in response to revelations of a secret treaty that had been signed by the British with the Hashemites during World War I, and takes double-dealing in the Middle East as indicative of moral corruption at the heart of the British government. 

 Sothebys has included the following quote from Gandhi: If it is true it shows the depth to which the British ministers descended for the purpose of gaining their end. And now that the end is secured they treat their own written word as so much waste paper. Is it any wonder that millions of Indians have lost faith in Great Britain and refuse to cooperate with her so long as she will not retrace her steps and purify herself of the corruption that is eating into her moral being. 

 Sothebys adds: These articles were printed together in April 1921 in Young India. Gandhi was the general editor of this weekly journal and many of his writings appeared there, including the three inflammatory articles which led to his conviction for sedition in 1922. As well as the manuscript, the album includes a series of letters that chart Gandhis relationship with a young Congress activist apparently working for Young India. These letters reveal both his immense goodwill towards the young man, and also the severe standards he set for those who would follow him. 

 It appears that India has lost an important part of its history.

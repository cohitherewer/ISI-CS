 Health charge glare

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: The 2006-07 Economic Survey released today said 15 states in India have successfully introduced user charges in government hospitals, but public health experts warned that the scheme is hurting the poor.

 The survey said the user charges are a fraction of charges in the private sector and are levied only from patients from families above the poverty line, while the poor continue to receive free or highly subsidised services.

 Assam, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Orissa and Bengal are among the states where government hospitals charge for diagnostic services, bed costs and surgical procedures. 

 The funds from user charges are intended for use in the maintenance of hospital buildings, improving cleanliness and hygiene, purchase of medicines and minor repair of equipment, the survey said.

 It said user charges are a definite way to raise resources to support health care delivery and improve the quality of health services. 

 However, public health specialists have challenged the claims that user charges improve the quality of health care services. All evidence shows that user charges are driving the poor away from public hospitals, said Abhay Shukla, convener of the Peoples Health Movement, a network of NGOs.

 A study from Andhra Pradesh has demonstrated that the use of government health facilities dropped by 20 per cent after the introduction of user charges, Shukla said.

 The free services for the poor is only on paper. It doesnt work in reality, said Anoop Saraya, professor of gastroenterology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

 Those who need free services often arent in a position even to ask for below-poverty certificates, Saraya said. 

 Doctors also argue that in the middle of seeking treatment, it is impractical to expect families to scramble for documents.

 A recent survey in Maharashtra by a Mumbai academic institution has shown that less than 6 per cent of people who approached government health facilities actually made use of the free services, Shukla said. In Maharashtra, where 25 per cent of the population is below poverty line, this proves that exemption is not working, he said. 

 There is no study to show that user charges have improved the quality of health care or patient satisfaction, Shukla said.

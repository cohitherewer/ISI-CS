 Race row

 London, Jan. 23 (Reuters): Channel 4 found itself at the centre of another race row today following comments about slavery by a former boarding school student in its latest reality TV show Shipwrecked.

 Viewers tuning into the programme during the weekend heard contestant Lucy Buchanan saying she was quite for the British Empire... and quite for slavery and things, but thats never going to come back. Describing herself as a traditional girl with traditional values, the 18-year-old from York shocked fellow participants by saying that black people were like, really bad.

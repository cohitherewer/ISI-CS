 Chicken drought

 Mumbai, March 27 (PTI): Digging into a succulent leg of chicken at an eatery here may be a bit difficult, thanks to a strike by wholesale poultry traders that began last week.

 We have hardly been getting any consignment of chicken. So, we are pushing lamb and fish, said Amitabh Chowdhury, manager of Fountain Sizzlers in south Mumbai, famous for its chicken dishes. He said the outlet was using its stored stock to cope with the dip in supply.

 The manager of a Bandra eatery famous for Chinese cuisine said poultry items were struck off its menu yesterday.

 A wholesale poultry trader said the strike began on March 23 to protest a decision by farmers not to reduce the price of poultry.

 Poultry farmers usually decrease prices of chicken after winter as demand is lower in summer. But this time they refused to do so, leading to the strike, said Wasim, a wholesale trader in Crawford Market.

 Nimitz runs into storm

 New Delhi, June 30: What the Left couldnt do, the weather has. 

 Monsoon storms over the Arabian Sea the same ones that are submerging Mumbai in floods have stalled an American warship on its way to Chennai, forcing the worlds mightiest country to concede defeat and seek a sudden replacement.

 The USS Princeton, a guided-missile carrier, is part of the same fleet as the USS Nimitz, the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in the middle of another storm one that is political in nature.

 Although US and Indian government officials have clarified that the Nimitz does not pose any radiation threat to India, the Left has been demanding that it be forbidden from docking at Indian ports. 

 The Nimitzs second visit in two years, the Left has alleged, was particularly symbolic of the aggressiveness of the US. But the defence ministry has described the port call as a routine affair. Ten nuclear-powered ships and submarines from France, the UK and the US, a ministry statement said, had earlier visited Indian ports.

 Unfortunately for the Left, the Nimitz, which was leading the Princeton by just a few nautical miles, escaped the storms.

 The Princeton, though, got caught in the storms, which officials at the Indian meteorological department say are likely to intensify further over the next two days.

 Some 4,000 US Navy officials on board the Nimitz were to be brought to shore by the Princeton, which was to have arrived at Chennai by tomorrow.

 The USS Pinckney, picked as replacement, is expected to arrive tomorrow.

 With the Princetons progress slowed down, the US Navy asked the Indian government for permission to allow the USS Pinckney right now in the clearer Indian Ocean as a replacement. 

 The process of allowing the Pinckney a destroyer finally got over yesterday, with officials allowing it to dock at Chennai after sailors from the Nimitz are transferred on it.

 The Pinckney, which shares its San Diego base with the Nimitz and the Princeton, is expected to arrive tomorrow.

 Mom, 14, leaves baby to die in toilet

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, July 6: A 14-year-old schoolgirl, taken to hospital by her parents after she complained of stomach pain, quietly slipped away to the toilet and gave birth to a girl.

 She left the baby on the dirty toilets cold floor, where it bled to death, and walked back to the outpatient department as if nothing had happened.

 There, the doctor who had examined her before she went to the toilet had just broken the horrifying news to her parents that their daughter was pregnant.

 Neither the doctor at Osmania General Hospital here nor the parents knew that the girl had already given birth.

 On the doctors advice, the parents took the girl to a maternity home 2km away. There a second shock awaited clothes store assistant Nagayya, 38, and housemaid Pushpa, 30.

 Your daughter has just delivered a baby, the obstetrician who examined the girl, a Class VIII student at a private school, told them.

 The stunned parents, struggling to come to terms with the events of the past couple of hours since their daughter had returned from school yesterday, listened in a daze as the doctor said she needed to be admitted for bleeding and weakness.

 The girl refused to answer any questions till Pushpa threatened suicide. I left the baby in the toilet of Osmania General Hospital, she mumbled.

 Seeing the dilemma of the illiterate and poor parents, the hospital informed police, who found the dead baby in a corner toilet at Osmania.

 The babys umbilical cord had been neatly cut and tied, raising the suspicion that a hospital employee, perhaps a nurse, had assisted the delivery.

 The doctors at the maternity home had at first suspected an abortion, but it has turned out to be much worse, inspector P. Ramaseshiah said at Afzalganj police station.

 A case has been lodged against the girl under IPC 318, which deals with concealment of birth by secret disposal of bodies. It carries a two-year term or a fine or both.

 The girls school is at the centre of the investigation into how she had got pregnant.

 The parents said they hadnt suspected anything.

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 19: The Supreme Court has dismissed a plea by Vikas Yadav, main accused in the Nitish Katara murder case, for a stay on his conviction in the Jessica Lal murder so that he can contest the Uttar Pradesh polls.

 This is not the only case against you, the court said. Vikas had contested the last elections.

 Vikas was relying on the apex courts recent order in Navjot Singh Sidhus case, in which the former cricketers conviction was suspended in a road rage case, allowing him to contest the Amritsar Lok Sabha by-election.

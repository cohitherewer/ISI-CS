 - EC issues notice for anti-Muslim comments; Party passes buck to state unit

 Rajnath Singh 

 Lucknow/New Delhi, April 5: 

 The Election Commission today sent the BJP a show-cause 

 notice and filed an FIR against party chief Rajnath Singh 

 and its senior Uttar Pradesh leader Lalji Tandon for allegedly 

 circulating anti-Muslim CDs.

 If the charges hold, the party could be de-recognised and its symbol frozen.

 Party sources tonight confirmed receiving the notice, addressed to Rajnath. He has been asked to reply to the accusations by 3 pm on Friday.

 Senior leaders Arun Jaitley and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi have gone into a huddle to finalise a response.

 The action in Delhi followed the FIRs in Lucknow under the Indian Penal Code and the representation of peoples act.

 Yesterday, the chief electoral officer of Uttar Pradesh had written to the BJPs state unit asking for a copy of the CD after media reports said they were being circulated. The request wasnt met.

 Today, BJP leaders were happy to see the anti-Muslim propaganda polarising voters. By evening though, the fear of a poll panel action began to gnaw away at the optimism.

 The Congress called for derecognition of the BJP, while former Prime Minister V.P. Singh complained to the poll panel about the communal CDs.

 Through the day, the partys national spokesperson, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, denied receiving any official communication from the commission.

 Asked about the CD, Rudy blamed the partys state unit, especially its spokesperson Manoj Mishra, for inadvertently provoking communal tension.

 It was an inadvertent error by an individual. It is an act of omission at the state level. The individual responsible is being punished. The party isnt responsible, Rudy said.

 However, the CD that the BJP now claims was the handiwork of a state functionary has been around for over four months.

 The CDs floating around now are only a lengthier version of the one officially distributed during the BJPs national executive in Lucknow last December.

 Not only were the offensive and communal CDs released to the media, they were also screened, unofficially, at the venue.

 The current video CD was officially released by Tandon along with 14 other discs as part of the partys campaign material.

 State unit spokesman Mishra may have been responsible for adding more material but, essentially, it is the same CD that was distributed at the BJPs national executive.

 Hung signal

 An NDTV opinion poll has forecast that the BSP will emerge as the single-largest party with 150-160 seats, but says the elections will produce a hung House.

 The opinion says the Samajwadi Party will get 140-150 seats, the BJP 55-65, the Congress 30-40, and others 10-20. 

 According to the opinion poll, which covered 16,000 voters in 133 seats, 40 per cent of the voters say Mayavati would make the best chief minister. Thirty-six per cent favour Mulayam for the top job.

 Advani loads minority gun

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Aug. 26: Lal Krishna Advani today blamed the repeal of a tough anti-terror law and the UPAs pampering of minorities for the increase in terrorist activities, though investigators havent yet named any suspects for last nights blasts.

 The former BJP chief visited the sites of the twin explosions that claimed over 40 lives and also called on the injured in city hospitals before meeting party workers.

 Advani said after Jammu and Kashmir, militants have targeted Mumbai and Hyderabad. Existing laws were not adequate to tackle the menace of cross-border terrorism, especially those aimed at an entire city, he added.

 The UPA government had sent a wrong signal by repealing the Prevention of Terrorism Act, he said, and called for the terror act to be revived.

 Only then can we stop the terrorist elements from doing things like the one in Hyderabad last evening, he said.

 After an emergency meeting of the Andhra cabinet, the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government said it would revive a tough state law, which had lapsed two years ago.

 Advani accused the UPA of promoting minorityism as a tool to get votes. Minorityism is a dangerous cult, pursued by the present regime simply for cultivating them as vote banks and jeopardising the security of the country, he said.

 Yesterdays attack on innocents in Hyderabad, both at Lumbini Park and Gokul Chat Bhandar, highlights this threat, he added.

 It is shocking that the Andhra government had not taken action against several persons in spite of advance warning by intelligence agencies again and again.

 Home minister K. Jana Reddy, however, said, the alert given by the Intelligence Bureau was of a general nature for the entire country and not particularly for Hyderabad.

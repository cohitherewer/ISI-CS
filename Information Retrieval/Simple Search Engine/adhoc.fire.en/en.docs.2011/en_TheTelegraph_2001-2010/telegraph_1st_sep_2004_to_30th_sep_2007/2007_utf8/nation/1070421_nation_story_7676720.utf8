 CPM breathes fire at Cong 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 20: The CPM, under fire over land acquisition in Bengal, has trained its guns on the Congress-led government in Delhi for pursuing anti-poor policies.

 In the latest edition of Peoples Democracy, the party mouthpiece, the CPM has warned the central coalition not to take the Lefts support for granted. The Congress leadership shouldnt take the support of the Left for granted by posing the threat of the BJP, the CPM has said. 

 The Congresss policies are creating discontent and helping the BJP. The CPM opposes all those political and economic measures that create the grounds for communal forces to feed popular discontent, the party says.

 The CPM has reaffirmed its support to the UPA government, if only to keep the BJP out of power, but warned it against straying from the common minimum programme and policies the Left has endorsed.

 Jyoti Basu left no doubt the support would stay. Despite differences on fundamental issues, we arent thinking of withdrawing support to the UPA as the BJP will use the opportunity to stage a comeback, he said in Calcutta today. With no Third Front in sight, the Marxists believe it is their political responsibility to keep the BJP out. 

 The CPM hasnt concealed its fears that the Centre might be making the BJPs return easier. 

 There is a disconnect between what the people and the Congress mass base expects and what the UPA government and its ministers are striving for, the article says. 

 The CPM also highlights the waning support for the Congress, citing its poor performance in the Punjab and Uttarakhand Assembly polls and the setback in the Delhi corporation elections as examples.

 Among members of the Union cabinet, the attack is the fiercest on finance minister P. Chidambaram, commerce minister Kamal Nath, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar and civil aviation minister Praful Patel. Even Planning Commission deputy chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia hasnt been spared. 

 The finance minister is criticised for glibly talking of a 10 per cent growth rate while doing little to rein in inflation. Nath is censured for trying to bring FDI into retail by hook or crook. Pawar is criticised for not getting the FCI to procure enough wheat even as private traders corner the crop. 

 Foreign policy has also come under attack. The bilateral negotiations with the US for the nuclear cooperation agreement are being held despite serious opposition to the conditions in the US legislation, the article says.

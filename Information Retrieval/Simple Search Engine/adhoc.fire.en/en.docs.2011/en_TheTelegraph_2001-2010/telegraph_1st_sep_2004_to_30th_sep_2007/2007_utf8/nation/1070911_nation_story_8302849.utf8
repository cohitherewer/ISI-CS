 Priyanka plea in SC

 Priyanka Chopra has urged the Supreme Court not to take any decision on her feud with former private secretary P. Jaju without hearing her side of the story. 

 The actresss lawyer, P. Narasimhan, filed a caveat in the court on Saturday. 

 The Indore bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court had acquitted her of the charge of having Jaju threatened by don Chhota Shakeel. 

 Jaju is expected to appeal in the Supreme Court against the acquittal.

 The case against Priyankas father, Ashok Chopra, is still pending. 

 Ashok Chopra, could not appear in a lower court hearing the case as he was suffering from cancer, prompting it to issue a non-bailable warrant, which is still effective. 

 Jaju had filed a case of criminal intimidation against them under Section 156 of the IPC. 

 He alleged Priyanka had had him threatened by Shakeel. He claimed Priyanka owed him Rs 1.37 crore, a figure she had contested.

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Skinny brigade raises eyebrows

 Shoppers at one of Delhis most popular retail markets got some free eye candy last week. Six models dressed in stylish, skinny jeans and invaded the Shoppers Stop store at Ansal Plaza, as part of the retail chains countrywide Do your Denim campaign. 

 It sure encourages you to purchase clothes when you have sexy people dressed in them, gushed Ragini Mahendroo, a student shopping at the time. 

 But the six models who like to call themselves the Skinny Brigade have their share of critics, too. 

 Shoppers Stop is promoting the idea of being skinny. It isnt the best thing to do, considering the growing number of cases, especially among girls, of eating disorders, said Dr Rachna Sachdeva of Max Healthcare hospital. 

 Doctors have warned for some years now that cases of anorexia nervosa the desire to stay lighter than the prescribed body weight because of a perception that one is obese are increasing in the metros. So is bulimia, in which people throw up to stay thin.

 Scholarship thieves booked

 It was a scholarship scheme that did not reach poor students, but a motley pack of greedy officials and their cronies.

 Early this month, the crooks had their day of reckoning when 17 of the 23 accused were packed off to jail, including prime accused Motiya Naik, a college secretary who will cool his heels in prison for 10 years.

 The scam goes back to the days when N. Chandrababu Naidus Telugu Desam was in power. Around Rs 50 crore, meant for students, was siphoned off by a clique of government officers, college employees, advocates and government accountants.

 Fake bills in the names of fictitious institutions and bogus beneficiaries (students) were furnished. The case took a bizarre twist when Sambhavi, a complainant, became an accused in the case. But she died before the trial opened.

 IAS officers lap it all up

 Tamil Nadu is racing to bridge the digital divide. And it is the IAS officers who are lapping up a bonanza in the rush.

 The states 295 officers will get laptops that will give them access to official information and data even after office hours, all at their fingertips.

 This is expected to be of great help when they handle an emergency.

 M. Karunanidhi handed the first of the sleek gadgets to chief secretary L.K. Tripathy last week. The chief minister oversees postings and transfers of top officials.

 The laptops will be in the personal possession of officers, which means all files, even those from previous meetings, can be retrieved whenever required.

 The state is spending Rs 2.24 crore on the laptops as part of its e-governance drive, prompting many to remark that an officers raj is now in force in the state. Next in the line for the laptops could be the IPS officers.

 Case study

 He once gave citizens the protection of law, but he can do little to ensure his own house is safe.

 A retired Bombay High Court judge returned to his flat in an upscale area of the city to find gold ornaments missing from his locker.

 Police are working out the value of the items, but initial estimates say it could be substantial.

 The heist in the Prakash Solal Shahs Cuffe Parade flat occurred early in June. 

 The incident grabbed the attention of the lawkeepers also because Shah, 82, is the father of sitting judge A.P Shah.

 Chennai: A rare collection of photographs by Nandini Valli is on display at the Alliance Francaise in Chennai till June 27. Valli secured a degree in photography from the UK.

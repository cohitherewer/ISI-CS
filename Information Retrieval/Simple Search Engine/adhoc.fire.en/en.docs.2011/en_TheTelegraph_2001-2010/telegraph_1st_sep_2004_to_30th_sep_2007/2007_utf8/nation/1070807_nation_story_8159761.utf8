 Dinner to devour differences

 Sonia Gandhi: Peace meal

 New Delhi, Aug. 6: Sonia Gandhis allies may be arming to take on the Congress over the Andhra police firing deaths, but she is busy drawing up the dinner menu.

 The UPA chairperson today decided to go in for a round of dinner diplomacy, inviting the Left and the Bahujan Samaj Party for a meal at the Maurya Sheraton on Wednesday.

 The occasion is being dubbed a show of solidarity in the run-up to the vice- presidential election on August 10.

 The UPA-Left combine is expected to have a smooth poll run as it has a majority in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, but sources said Sonias intention goes beyond the dinner.

 It is clear she is keen on consolidating the unity achieved in the presidential election or, at least, not frittering away the gains, a Congress member said.

 The Left-UPA unity was a contrast to the divided and sub-divided Opposition, he added.

 The NDA, which came apart in the presidential election, has shown no signs yet of regrouping. The BJP is under strain after chief Rajnath Singh reportedly went on record on RSS intervention in party matters. The third front remains a loose collection of leaders pursuing different ideologies and not knowing whether they should go with the NDA or the Left.

 In a meeting with general secretaries last week, Sonia had said the Congress should keep intact its strength in states where it did well in the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls. At the same time, it should work hard in states where it was in decline Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and try to retain allies in areas where its presence was negligible.

 She is believed to have stressed that while the party should keep striving for a majority of its own, coalition politics could not be shaken off in a hurry. Hence, allies were important.

 In a sense, she settled the debate of going alone versus having a coalition which has agonised us for long, a general secretary said.

 The sources said the Congress was mentally prepared to go into the 2009 elections as part of the UPA. They felt that none of the allies, including the NCP, would ditch the Congress barring unforeseen circumstances.

 An example of the NCP-Congress inter-dependency was visible in Goa where Sharad Pawars party stuck on as smaller allies walked out of the government. Pawar also indicated that he wanted to tie up with the Congress for the Gujarat elections.

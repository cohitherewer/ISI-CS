 Bengal ban looms on plastic bags

 SIMI KAMBOJ

Calcutta, March 29: Get ready to say goodbye to the plastic bag in which you carry home the box of sandesh or the fruits and veggies from the neighbourhood bazaar.

 Bags less than 40 microns thick and measuring less than 18 inches by 12 inches are to be banned in Bengal. 

 A notification will be issued after a meeting that environment minister Sailen Sarkar will hold on April 5 with civic body chiefs, the India Plastics Federation, the association of cottage and small scale industry, pollution control board officials and the police. 

 Curbs are already in place on bags less than 20 microns thick, but the order is widely violated.

 Environment secretary M.L. Meena said the move will help enforce the existing curbs on bags less than 20 microns thick better because it will be easier to identify the banned bags.

 We will extend the ban to bags below 40 microns after a Jadavpur University study recommended it. Unless we make the rules stringent, the ban will continue to be flouted and drains will remain clogged, said Meena. 

 A panel of officials of the environment department, pollution control board and the police will monitor the ban.

 The ban on plastic less than 20 microns thick and measuring less than 8 by 12 inches has been clamped under the Plastic Recycling and Reuse Act, 1999. Its violation can be punished with fines that can go up to Rs 1 lakh or with imprisonment that can be as long as six years. 

 Officials say plastic bags less than 20 microns thick have no recycling value and are discarded carelessly. Good-quality heavier bags are easier to recycle. Also, people will not throw them because they can be stored and resold, said Meena. 

 Smaller bags, the ones handed out by sweet shops and fruit sellers, normally have a thickness of five to seven microns and cost only 10 to 20 paisa. However, the larger and thicker bags cost at least Rs 3. We hope the rise in prices of larger bags will discourage the use of plastic, said a senior environment department official.

 There is a blanket ban on plastic bags in Himachal Pradesh. 

 Last year, Maharashtra issued an ordinance banning all plastic items less than 50 microns thick. This followed the July 2005 deluge, when plastic choked sewers and hampered efforts to drain out water.

 95% chance Bobs body will talk

 New Delhi, March 21: Forensic pathologists say their science has advanced to levels where the cause of death can be determined in 95 per cent of autopsy cases and the post-mortem on Bob Woolmer may also yield answers in time. 

 Without releasing details of even the preliminary autopsy findings, Jamaican police said on Tuesday that they are treating Woolmers death as suspicious and are continuing a full investigation. 

 Pathologists who are routinely asked to get bodies to talk say that while every case is unique, sudden or unexplained death almost always leaves behind tell-tale signs in blood, organs, or tissues. 

 Only two to five per cent of autopsy examinations remain inconclusive where the cause of death cannot be ascertained, said G. Pradeep Kumar, professor of forensic pathology at the Kasturba Medical College in Manipal. 

 It happens sometimes that we may find abnormalities in the body that we cannot pinpoint as the cause of death, or some conditions may just not leave any signs, Kumar told The Telegraph. 

 For instance, doctors say, arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) a heart-related condition that sometimes causes sudden death may not show up in an autopsy. 

 Sudden death from arrhythmia may lead to an inconclusive autopsy, said Mahabalesh Shetty, a forensic pathologist in Mangalore. 

 Doctors say most toxins are usually easy to detect. Some are apparent even in the colour of blood or in the odour that may emanate from the tissues. Cyanide, for instance, turns blood into pink red, while carbon monoxide poisoning gives blood a cherry red colour and insecticide poisoning leads to a kerosene-like smell in the body, a pathologist said. 

 A stroke leaves behind signs of haemorrhage or dead tissue in the brain. A heart attack leads to certain enzymes.

 Without such easy-to-recognise signs, doctors resort to toxicological analysis of blood, liver, kidney, urine, or stomach contents. A toxic substance may be degraded in the liver or the kidney and should be detectable as a residue in such organs, Shetty said. 

 The toxicological analysis typically takes three to four days depending on the load of work that an analytical laboratory has piled up. Some single shot tests can rule out or detect the presence of up to five potentially toxic compounds. 

 Kumar said the proportion of unsolved deaths despite autopsy varies anywhere from 2 per cent to 5 per cent around the world, determined by facilities available. Its higher in developing countries where cold storage and other laboratory facilities may not always be available everywhere.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Jamait claims mediation plea

 DHIRENDRA K. JHA AND BISWAJIT ROY

 New Delhi/Calcutta, April 2: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee apparently wants the Jamait Ulema-i-Hinds national leadership to mediate between his government and the Nandigram protesters, but the outfit is playing hardball.

 The Bengal chief minister is believed to have sprung the request at the 20-minute talks yesterday with the Jamait general secretary at Banga Bhavan, but Maulana Mehmood Madani declined to make any commitment.

 The chief minister asked me to help defuse the impasse in Nandigram following the March 14 killings, Madani told The Telegraph. But I told him we will have to first talk to the local Jamait leaders in the state.

 The Jamait is part of the Bhumi Uchcched Pratirodh Committee that is at the forefront of the unrest in Nandigram, which has a sizeable minority population.

 Madani claimed he told Bhattacharjee the Jamait would not go to the talks table alone. Rather, it would abide by the collective decision of all 29 organisations in the committee protesting land acquisition. I asked the chief minister to talk to all the constituents of the committee, not just the Jamait leadership, he said.

 Bhattacharjee also tried to explain the corrective steps he was taking in Nandigram and the special measures for uplift of the minorities. But I told him the two are different issues and to break the Nandigram stalemate, he must initiate the dialogue with all the constituents, Madani said.

 In Calcutta, Bengal Jamait secretary Siddiqullah Chowdhury began whetting knives against the chemical hub the chief minister proposes to shift out of Nandigram into Haldia. We will oppose the chemical hub even if it comes up in Haldia. Many industrialised countries have banned these highly hazardous industries as they have a deadly impact on human lives and environment, Chowdhury said today.

 Citing the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster, he said the Jamait proposed to mobilise peoples green brigades against the hub. We will decide our course of action on April 4 and plan demonstrations in Haldia, he said, hinting he would like to keep the issue burning till next years panchayat polls.

 Chowdhury has invited Madani to Nandigram to show him the sugar-coated lies told by the chief minister and CPM leaders about the March 14 firing. He claimed the CPM leaders had tried to impress Madani by stressing on their efforts to get the Sachar committee recommendations implemented in Bengal and elsewhere. 

 But he indicated he would not mind discussions with Bhattacharjee as talks are part of the democratic system.

 Sandalwood thief shot in army school

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai/Pune, July 11: On a day Mumbai remembered the victims of the July 11 blasts, jawans at the National Defence Academy in neighbouring Pune were battling an unusual threat not AK-47-wielding militants but sandalwood thieves armed with choppers and axes.

 A security patrol of jawans foiled a big sandalwood theft on the 8,400-acre campus of the military academy at Khadakvasla, 24km from Pune, early this morning, and shot dead one member of a gang of 12 to 15 thieves, police said.

 Police sources said the armed robbers entered the high-security campus around midnight to chop sandalwood trees located near staff quarters. A woman belonging to a guards family spotted them and raised an alarm.

 To stop the woman from alerting the patrol, the group assaulted her. But the security personnel heard her and confronted the robbers. When one of them tried to attack a jawan, he fired in self-defence, killing a thief, additional commissioner Rajinder Singh of Pune police said.

 The identity of the thief could not be immediately ascertained, Singh said, adding sandalwood thefts have been sporadically reported in Pune.

 Defence officials were unavailable for comment.

 A gang of sandalwood thieves had poached trees a few months ago at Aga Khan Palace that houses memorials of Mahatma Gandhi and his wife Kasturba. Other such thefts had been reported in Punes forest areas in the past.

 Last week, Mumbais anti-terrorist squad intercepted two trucks carrying 244 logs of red sandalwood worth Rs 20 lakh near the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust. The trucks were coming from Andhra Pradesh.

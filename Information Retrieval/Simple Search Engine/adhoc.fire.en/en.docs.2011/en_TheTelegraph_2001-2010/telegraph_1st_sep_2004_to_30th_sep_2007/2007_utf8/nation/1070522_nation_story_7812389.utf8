 Cable bill cut-off plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 21: Monthly cable charges could be frozen at Rs 250, plus taxes, if Trai has its way.

 The broadcast regulator is toying with the figure in its first review of cable tariffs in non-CAS areas since freezing charges in October 2004.

 But before the die is cast, talks will be held with broadcasters, multi-system operators and cable operators.

 Trai released a consultation paper on tariffs in non-CAS areas today. It has asked for suggestions by June 4. 

 It wants to know how the right tariff should be set, how inflation should be taken into account and whether a ceiling on monthly bills is a good idea. Its figure of Rs 250 is based on a 2004 survey that put the average monthly bill at Rs 176.

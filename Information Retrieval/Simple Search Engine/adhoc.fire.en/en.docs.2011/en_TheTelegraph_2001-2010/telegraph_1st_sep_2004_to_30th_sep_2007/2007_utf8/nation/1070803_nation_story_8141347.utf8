The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Leave hope flickers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: The government today woke up to an archaic service rule framed by the British to grant leave travel concession to military personnel and scrapped it. 

 Sixty years ago this month, the British departed from India, but military personnel were granted the concession every alternate year only up to 1,450km roughly the distance from Delhi to Calcutta or Mumbai. 

 It has taken a spurt in suicides and fragging the act of killing a superior in the army to bring about the change. 

 Studies by the Defence Institute of Psychological Research (DIPR) have listed 171 reasons contributing to high stress among soldiers in hardship areas.

 Defence minister A.K. Antony woke up to the rule during his visit to Kashmir last week, where soldiers repeated the complaint he had heard during tours of the Northeast. 

 Under the rule, Madras Regiment soldiers (for example) all of them recruits from the south were able to cover only a fraction of their travel costs if they were posted in Siachen, the Valley or in Arunachal Pradesh.

 Since the DIPR pointed out in multiple studies that high stress in counter-insurgency areas often led to suicides and fragging, Antony decided to ease some of the pressure.

 Under the new rule, soldiers in field postings will be eligible to take leave and visit their hometowns twice a year without distance restriction.

 Bus waits for Sidhu

 Sidhu: Relieved 

 New Delhi/Chandigarh, Jan. 13: Indias cricket selectors had kept Navjot Singh Sidhu flitting in and out of the national team. But his party selectors are ready to delay their poll line-up till they know for sure whether he can be fielded.

 If the Supreme Court accepts Sidhus plea for a stay on his conviction, he is sure to be renominated for the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat, from which he resigned last month after his conviction.

 At the BJPs central election committee meeting last evening, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh agreed with the partys minder for Punjab, Arun Jaitley, that Sidhu was an automatic choice.

 Sidhu, freed from a Patiala jail today after the apex court gave him bail yesterday, is convicted of causing the death of a man in a street brawl in 1988. His appeal against the verdict comes with a request for a stay on the conviction.

 If the Supreme Court grants the stay during the January 17 hearing, Sidhu will be eligible to contest the February 13 bypoll, to be held with the Assembly elections.

 The BJP will not name the candidates even for the Assembly segments from Amritsar until the court hearing.

 Sidhu is so popular that if he contests, we dont even have to campaign for the other candidates in Amritsar, a leader said. If he is allowed to contest, we dont have to worry too much about who we field. If he is not, then we have to be very careful.

 The BJP list, therefore, names only 15 candidates though the party will contest 23 Assembly seats. The central election committee will meet on January 19 to pick the remaining eight, including the nominees for Amritsar Central, North and West seats.

 Walking out of the jail where he spent two nights, Sidhu told a crowd of supporters he would campaign for the BJP-Shiromani Akali Dal alliance even if he cant contest.

 Amid cries of Sidhu zindabad, the maverick TV commentator was back to his best. I will bow before the law but never before this Raja (chief minister Amarinder Singh) who has robbed the state. I throw a challenge to him I will campaign for the BJP and the Akali Dal, he said.

 The BJP has picked its candidates for the eight Assembly seats in Manipur. The Uttaranchal list is yet to be declared.

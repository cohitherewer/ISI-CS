 New Delhi, April 23: The questions might be short and the tone polite, but Delhi police officials insist that the interrogation will be gruelling.

 Those at the receiving end wont be ordinary criminals, but four Lok Sabha members suspected of involvement in a trafficking racket that was exposed with the arrest of BJP MP Babubhai Katara.

 Tomorrow could bring a big breakthrough. Honestly, most of us cant wait, said an official.

 Named by key suspect Sunderlal Yadav during interrogation, Mitrasen Yadav, Ashok Rawat and Mohammed Tahir Khan (all from the BSP) and the BJPs Ramswaroop Koli will initially be questioned individually, the officials said. 

 The MPs will be asked for details of their foreign travels, the reasons for the trips and their association with travel agents. 

 They have all been asked to bring passports belonging to them and their direct families. In the initial part, the interrogation will focus on their travels in the past, an official said. 

 Delhi police have seized at least 30 fake passports in raids across the country, 18 of them from Katara. 

 After the police quiz them on their past visits abroad, the MPs will be asked pointed questions based on information gathered from Sunderlal.

 The police suspect the MPs might deny knowing Sunderlal, a paan shop owner. In that case, Sunderlal will be brought before each of them.

 We will question Sunderlal Yadav and the particular MP face to face. Officers trained at noticing subtle facial or body expressions will be observing their interactions, the official said.

 The police are also thinking of bringing the four MPs in the same room at this stage for some specific common questions. 

 Asked whether the MPs would be arrested if they fail to appear tomorrow, Delhi police spokesperson Rajan Bhagat said their replies are awaited. Law will take its course. Arrest is the last step.

 On Kolis statement that he had not visited any foreign country, Bhagat said: He will have to explain that to the interrogators.

 Later tomorrow, the police plan to take Katara to his constituency, Dahod in Gujarat. This trip is aimed at identifying the Gujarat link in the racket BJP officials, travel agents, etc, an official said.

 Alliance lesson for Congress

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: Smart alliances had lifted the Congress to power in 2004 and alliances scripted the triumphs in the Maharashtra, Assam and Tamil Nadu state polls that followed.

 That knowledge seemed to rub salt into the Congresss wounds as the three-year dream run was snapped by todays civic poll rout.

 The party realises it had dug its own grave by taking a struggling Sena-BJP lightly and focusing on settling scores with ally Nationalist Congress Party.

 Congress sources said it was beginning to dawn on the leadership that spiting an ally was counter-productive, and that the folly of going solo had given the Sena-BJP a hoist-up.

 Our calculations went haywire, a source said, accusing central minders and state leaders of misleading the high command. The feedback from Margaret Alva, Prabha Rau and chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh was that the Sena and BJP had been hit hard by the Uddhav-Raj Thackeray clash and Pramod Mahajans death. The Congress just had to walk into the vacant space, making sure the NCP didnt grab too much of the pie.

 So the bosses in Delhi took scant notice of the complaints of Muslims being harassed after the Mumbai and Malegaon blasts and the charges of state government bungling after the July 2005 deluge.

 Now, the Congress is focused on retaining power in Uttarakhand and Manipur, and then in Goa. Sources said only a miracle would keep Amarinder Singh in power in Punjab.

 The party believes that in Uttarakhand, chief minister N.D. Tiwari has a lot to show on the development front. But sources admitted that his not being in the fray may dilute the advantage, especially by splitting the Brahmin vote in favour of the BJPs B.C. Khanduri.

 The Congresss stakes wouldnt be very high in Uttar Pradesh.

 Sonia arms Pranab for Pak trip

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 Pranab Mukherjee

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee travels to Pakistan on Saturday, his hand to negotiate with President Pervez Musharraf considerably strengthened by Congress president Sonia Gandhi herself putting a stamp on the Prime Ministers idea of soft borders between the two Kashmirs at the Congress Working Committee meeting last month.

 So when Mukherjee meets Musharraf on January 13 besides Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and foreign minister Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri and discusses a resolution of the Siachen dispute and the Prime Ministers impending trip to Pakistan, among a variety of issues, he will speak from a position of strength cleared at the highest levels of the party.

 At the CWC meeting last month, Sonia wanted her Kashmiri partymen to tell her what they thought of the Prime Ministers initiatives with Pakistan on one hand, and between the Centre and Srinagar on the other.

 She is then said to have indicated to the Kashmir group informally set up consisting of leaders as varied as Karan Singh, Saifuddin Soz, Ghulam Nabi Azad and M.L. Fotedar that she was in agreement with the view that people from both parts of Kashmir should be allowed to meet each other as much as possible, short of redrawing maps on the ground.

 That is why, over the last week or so, Mukherjee has met a wide cross-section of Kashmiri leaders in the capital, from the Abdullahs of the National Conference to Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad.

 Yesterday, the Prime Minister had a quiet meeting with Peoples Democratic Party chief Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, and intends to meet Hurriyat leaders before Mirwaiz Umer Farooq travels to Islamabad next week to meet Musharraf.

 Interestingly, Mukherjee, the acknowledged number two man in the Manmohan government, has never been to Pakistan. This is his first visit to that country.

 On the cards, over January 13-14, is a substantive, bilateral visit where both sides will give and take and hope to find new solutions to decades-old issues from Siachen and Sir Creek to Manmohans visit to Pakistan, possibly even before the Saarc summit in April.

 Official sources here indicated that Pakistan was now amenable to authenticating ground positions of Indian troops in Siachen on maps. They pointed out that it was possible to afterwards jointly develop the actual ground position line beyond where it stops at grid reference NJ9842.

 The sources also pointed out that besides terrorism, a number of other areas needed to be negotiated. For example, India was not going to accept the Pakistani position of joint management and control of Kashmir. Instead, it wanted some form of joint, consultative mechanism, which could discuss issues of interest from ecology to health.

 The bird flu doesnt respect borders, the sources said.

 Besides Islamabad, Mukherjee will also travel to Taxila, the ancient seat of Buddhist learning. By doing so, he will be breaking one rule in the current India-Pakistan relationship and making a new one.

 Indian diplomats are currently not allowed to step beyond the precincts of Islamabad Pakistans tiny capital city, only somewhat larger than the area between Nandan and Writers Buildings in Calcutta.

 Travelling to Taxila, which is about 70-odd km from Islamabad, is expected to demolish this rule. Indian diplomats hope this tourism site will henceforth be open to permanent travel.

 In return, Pakistani diplomats in India want to break free from New Delhis stifling restrictions and be allowed to travel to nearby hip Gurgaon and even Noida.

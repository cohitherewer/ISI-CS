 Cop in net for rape in curfew 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Feb. 4: A constable was arrested today for allegedly raping a woman he had offered to help in riot-torn Gorakhpur.

 On January 29, Jaswant Singh barged into a house in the towns Vikas Nagar after hearing cries for help. Once in, he found the 21-year-old alone but, instead of helping shield her from attackers who were on the prowl that night, Singh allegedly raped her. He has been suspended.

 Coming days after revelations about how the police helped keep the Nithari killers out of the laws reach, the rape has fuelled tension in violence-wracked Gorakhpur. Curfew was imposed in the town after communal clashes.

 Inspector-general Jagmohan Yadav said the woman has been sent for medical examination after a complaint from her mother. The incident is unfortunate but weve taken prompt action.

 Police sources say the communal clashes, ignited on January 27, could have been nipped in the bud had the political parties cooperated, but politicians trying to polarise voters ahead of the Assembly polls have made it difficult.

 The rape occurred as political parties traded charges on who was responsible for fomenting trouble. The violence increased after local BJP MP Yogi Adityanath was arrested for allegedly sending armed cadres to terrorise people from another community. He is still in jail, but his supporters are causing trouble. 

 Senior BJP leader Kalyan Singh was arrested in Barabanki while he was on his way to Gorakhpur, but was released later.

 Rain shadow on rice

 New Delhi, June 29: The monsoon rainfall this year is likely to be 7 per cent below average and Indias grain basket region in the north-west may be the worst hit, weather scientists predicted today. 

 In a revised forecast, the Indian Meteorological Department said rainfall over India is likely to be 93 per cent of the average of 89 cm a value slightly lower than what the IMD had predicted earlier this year, but still within the range of what it defines as normal rainfall. 

 The IMD today also issued forecasts for four geographical regions of the country, predicting that the rainfall would be 10 per cent below average in the north-west and 2 per cent below average in the northeastern states. 

 July rainfall which is important for crops is expected to be 5 per cent below average. 

 The forecast for the northwestern region is not good, but it is consistent with the 7 per cent below average forecast for the country as a whole, said Madhavan Rajeevan, the director of the IMDs National Climate Centre in Pune. 

 Agricultural scientists said below average rainfall is likely to increase the cost of cultivation. Rice is a major monsoon season crop, particularly in Punjab where 2.5 million hectares of land is under rice cultivation from June through early October. 

 Farmers here wont let their crops suffer they will turn to pumping groundwater which will mean higher costs on diesel because electricity is generally scarce during this season, said Raj Kumar Mahey, professor of agronomy at the Punjab Agricultural University in Ludhiana. 

 In such a situation, crop yields are unlikely to reduce, but profit margins for farmers will decrease, Mahey told The Telegraph. We saw this happen in 2002 which was a drought year the impact was more on cultivation costs than on yields, he said. 

 The IMD forecast is calculated statistically with the help of near and distant weather parameters that influence the monsoon. Scientists said they had lowered their original forecast by two points to 7 per cent below average because two weather parameters sea surface temperatures in the southern Pacific Ocean and atmospheric pressure at sea level in the northern Atlantic appear to be slightly unfavourable for the monsoon rainfall. 

 The monsoon hit Kerala four days ahead of the normal date of June 1, and since then has advanced across southern, central and eastern India, touching parts of Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi on June 28.

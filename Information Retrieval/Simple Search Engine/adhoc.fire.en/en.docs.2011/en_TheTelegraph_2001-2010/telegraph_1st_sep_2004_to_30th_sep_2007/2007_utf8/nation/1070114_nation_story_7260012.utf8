 Civic tussle splits allies

 Mumbai, Jan. 13: Seat-sharing talks between the alliance partners in Maharashtra the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party for a pre-poll alliance in Mumbai, the biggest of the 10 municipal corporations going to polls on February 1, failed today. 

 Leaders from both the parties insisted that the breaking up of the alliance was limited only to the municipal elections, and would not impact the governments in Maharashtra or at the Centre. 

 The Congress and the NCP had already decided to contest elections on their own in six of the 10 civic bodies, but intense seat-sharing discussions were on for the civic polls in Mumbai, Thane, Akola and Nashik where the Shiv Sena-BJP combine was in power. 

 The Congress-NCP leadership in Akola in Vidarbha region managed to stitch together an alliance but the two parties will contest against each other in the rest of the nine civic bodies, including Thane, Ulhasnagar, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Solapur, Nashik, Nagpur, Amravati and Mumbai. 

 In Mumbai, the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance has dominated the civic body elections since it first came to power in 1985. But the alliance has been on a decline after a crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in 2004. Sensing that rebellions within the Shiv Sena and the death of Pramod Mahajan, the architect of the alliance, had weakened the saffron alliance further, the Congress-NCP combine decided to move in for the kill.

 Sharad Pawars NCP had won only 14 seats in the last civic election in Mumbai, with the Congress bagging 64, the Shiv Sena 104 and the BJP 36 in the 227-seater corporation. 

 The seat-sharing negotiations, which began a fortnight ago and involved central leaders like Praful Patel and Margaret Alva, opened with the NCP demanding 100 seats, and the Congress willing to concede only 44. The Congress finally agreed to let the NCP contest 65 seats. However, the NCPs claim for two seats now held by the Congress eventually led to the break-up. 

 While the drama over the break-up in the ruling alliance was unfolding, the Mumbai Congress headquarter was abuzz with rumours that MP Priya Dutt had threatened to resign over being sidelined in seat-sharing talks. 

 However, Mumbai Congress chief Gurudas Kamat, accompanied by AICC secretary Siddarth Patel, denied the reports.

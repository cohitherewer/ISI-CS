 Mulayam Singh Yadav and Ajit Singh: No love lost 

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: Wary of Ajit Singh, the Congress is adopting a cautious approach in Uttar Pradesh.

 But the party feels that imposition of Presidents rule in the state may prove a double-edged sword.

 It believes the end of the alliance with Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) would loosen chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavs stranglehold on the administration in a state going to elections soon. But there could be a surge of sympathy if the chief minister is ousted through central rule.

 A Congress general secretary said they couldnt trust Ajit Singh fully because of his tendency to switch sides before every election after striking the best bargains he could get. 

 Once elections are over, there is no guarantee that Ajit Singh will honour the alliance and not back the winning side to be part of the next government, the general secretary said. 

 A few months ago, Ajit Singh tried to get a place in the Union cabinet in exchange for withdrawing support to the Mulayam Singh government. But the plan came unstuck because he bargained for portfolios held by senior Congress ministers. The party didnt agree.

 Sources say a pre-poll pact will not help either side much because of ground realities. The Congress is looking to revive its old Brahmin-Muslim-Dalit alliance. It is also trying to win the support of some of the most backward castes as well. Ajit Singhs Jat votes do not fit into this scheme of things, sources in the Congress said.

 The Congresss strategy should be to go back to the people and fight all seats alone. Any pact, big or small, doesnt help because votes ultimately never get transferred. At least that is what the Congresss experience has been, said party general secretary Digvijay Singh.

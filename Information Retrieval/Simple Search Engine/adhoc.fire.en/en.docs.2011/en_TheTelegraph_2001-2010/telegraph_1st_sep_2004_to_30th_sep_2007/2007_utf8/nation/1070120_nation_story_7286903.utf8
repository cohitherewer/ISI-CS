 Wadias gun fools scanner

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 19: Air-India today suspended an employee at Mumbai airports baggage clearing section for failure to detect a pistol and 30 bullets in the baggage of Nusli Wadia, whose group owns GoAir, on January 13.

 Wadia, the chairman of Bombay Dyeing, was questioned by Dubai airport customs after the licensed but undeclared pistol and ammunition were found.

 Wadia, who travelled on Air-Indias Flight 717 from Mumbai to Dubai, was quizzed for 45 minutes by customs officials after showing his licensed weapon. 

 In a statement, Wadias office blamed a domestic help for the fiasco. The statement said that on January 13, Wadia was scheduled to take an Emirates Airlines flight at 7.15 pm, but it was rescheduled for the next day. He then decided to fly by Flight 717 at 2.15 pm.

 Since he had to leave in a great hurry, he asked his help at home to pack his bags. The help inadvertently packed a wash bag containing a licensed firearm, which was lying in his closet unused for several years. It was very similar to one containing his washroom articles in his check-in bag, the statement said.

 It added that the bag was checked in at Mumbai airport and cleared normal security procedures. On arrival at the Dubai airport, the firearm was discovered to Mr Wadias great surprise and shock while retrieving his luggage, the statement said, terming it a freak accident.

 An Air-India spokesperson said: Security is our topmost priority. We have taken a serious view of this incident. Aviation sources said Wadia could be prosecuted by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security under the Aircraft Carriage of Dangerous Goods Act for travelling with dangerous items.

 Aviation officials said the Prime Minister, the President and the Chief Justice of India are the only VIPs not frisked at the airports in the country.

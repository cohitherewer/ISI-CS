 Ottavio hearing date deadline

 Buenos Aires, March 6 (PTI): The Argentinian judge to whom Bofors accused Ottavio Quattrocchis papers have been forwarded has about a fortnight to decide when to begin the hearing. 

 Quattrocchis lawyer Alejandro Freeland has yet to receive confirmation that his client will face an extradition hearing in Misiones province, but expects to hear from the authorities there in the next 24 to 48 hours.

 Attempts to seek Quattrocchis extradition moved a step forward yesterday after the Argentinian government cleared the 250-page file submitted by India, which was then flown to El Dorado city to be examined by the local judge.

 The judge, according to Argentinian law, will set a date for a hearing within 15 days of receiving the papers.

 Freeland said he has yet to be given access to the CBIs paperwork and remained sceptical about its contents.

 Left call for better nuclear deal

 Calcutta, Sept. 20: CPM ally Forward Bloc today said it does not want to precipitate early polls over the Left-Congress nuke deal spat, reports our special correspondent.

 All we are asking for is a better Indo-US deal. We have told the government to wait for the US Congress to amend the countrys energy act of 1954 to ensure uninterrupted nuclear fuel supply to India, said Debabrata Biswas, the Bloc general secretary and member of the Left-UPA committee on the deal.

 Biswas said the Left would pin its hopes on nationalists within the Congress.

 The RSP, another Left partner, feels the time is not ripe yet to sever ties with the UPA. We are not exactly optimistic about the outcome of the Left-UPA joint mechanism. Nevertheless, we arent saying let us pull the plug immediately, central secretariat member Manoj Bhattacharya said.

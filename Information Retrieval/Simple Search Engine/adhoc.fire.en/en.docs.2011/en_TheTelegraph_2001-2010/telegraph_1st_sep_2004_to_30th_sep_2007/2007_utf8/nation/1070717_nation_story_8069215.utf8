 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Plan rewards late payments

 What happens when you dont pay a fine in time? No, you dont have to pay extra. Instead, you get to pay less than those who stick to deadlines. At least in Delhi. 

 In the latest display of why Delhi is the political capital of India, the Centre slashed the fines to be paid by all those who violated the June 30 deadline of the new Master Plan. 

 Less than 1 per cent of over 5 lakh Delhi residents who have to pay the fine couched in the friendlier term of conversion charges to continue to run commercial establishments in residential localities have paid up. Instead of penalising those who havent, the urban development ministry has decided to slash the fine determined on the basis of the illegally built-up area by three-fourths. 

 The Master Plan, introduced earlier this year, has already legalised most of the illegally run establishments and unauthorised construction that were targeted during demolition and sealing drives last year. 

 If we dont help residents, the purpose of the Master Plan will be defeated, minister of state for urban development Ajay Maken said. 

 Voice to text, instantly

 A private engineering college promoted by a computer industry czar is going where few of its peers have gone before it is creating a software that converts voice into Tamil script and presents it directly on the screen of a PC. 

 The path-breaking plan by SSN College of Engineering, set up by NIIT man Shiv Nadar, could help narrow the digital divide by giving computer illiterates a chance to be a part of the infotech revolution.

 All that a native speaker has to do is sit in front of a computer and say whatever he wants to, through a microphone. His words are automatically turned into text on the screen as they are uttered.

 The software even picks up minute differences in intonation and diction. And still generates the correct words.

 Big players like it small

 Unlike most politicians who turn their birthday celebrations into events that resemble election-time rallies, two powerful men in Andhra prefer to keep it low key.

 hief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy and Telugu Desam boss N. Chandrababu Naidu might not agree on where the state is headed, but they share a common trait: both have made it a point to slip away from the public gaze on their birthdays.

 YSR celebrated his 58th birthday last week in faraway Maldives quietly, with only his family in tow. Last year, he spent the day at his farmhouse in Kadapa.

 Naidu used to famously take off with his close relatives to hill resorts and destinations in other states like Shimla and Kumarakom, Kerala. At other times, he hopped across to the Gulf and the US that was when his son was studying there. 

 By contrast, the supporters of other politicians and film stars, Chiranjeevi is an example, set up blood donation camps and organise public feasts for the poor and homeless.

 Smart tickets

 Southern Railway has decided to give its high-paying passengers a different experience not inside the trains, but right when they book their tickets at the counters.

 Those travelling by first class AC will be given computer-generated tickets in glossy colourful envelopes much like the airlines have been doing for years.

 An order to this effect was issued last week. The colourful covers are now being printed and should be at the reservation counters this week. The covers, adorned with pictures, will highlight the railways achievements.

 Bangalore: Listen to your favourite musicals this Tuesday. The list includes The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady, Grease, Fiddler on the Roof and Les Miserables. Presented by the William Joseph International Academy for Performing Arts at 7pm at Chowdaiah Memorial Hall. Call 9844119956 for tickets.

 Third-party damper

 K.P. NAYAR 

 Washington, Feb. 12: India and Pakistan will both claim victory in the World Bank-appointed neutral experts verdict on the construction of the Baglihar dam in Jammu and Kashmir, but the real import of Raymond Lafittes judgement will be to discourage Islamabad from seeking third-party mediation on disputes with Delhi, including Kashmir.

 In April 2005, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had personally interceded with Pervez Musharraf during his visit to New Delhi to withhold Pakistan from approaching the World Bank for mediation on the validity of constructing the 450-mw Baglihar Hydropower Project under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960.

 Musharraf agreed but went back to Islamabad and gave in to pressure at home to seek third-party mediation on Baglihar as a test case and a new precedent in settling disputes with India. 

 Today, after nearly two years of work, the expert appointed by the World Bank a signatory to the 1960 treaty handed over his report to Indian and Pakistani diplomats in Berne to be conveyed to their governments.

 Lafitte, a professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, cleared the project itself to be in conformity with the Indus Waters Treaty, rejecting a claim to the contrary by Pakistan. At the same time, he asked India to reduce the height of the dam by one and half metres, conceding one of the objections raised by Pakistan.

 India has not yet officially commented on the report. But Pakistans minister for water and power Liaquat Ali Jatoi hurriedly called a news conference in Islamabad to claim that Lafittes report is Pakistans victory on the issue and a proof that India had violated the Indus Waters Treaty.

 In approaching the World Bank, the argument in top levels of the Pakistani establishment was that no dispute with India had ever been resolved to Islamabads satisfaction through a bilateral process, and that third-party mediation was in Pakistans interest.

 A verdict by Lafitte proclaiming Baglihar to be in violation of the Indus Waters Treaty or suggesting fundamental changes in the design of the dam or the hydel power project would have prompted Pakistan to similarly stall the 330-mw Kishenganga hydro-power project and the 600-mw Sawalkote Hydroelectric Project, which could bring immense economic benefits to Jammuand Kashmir. Lafittes report is highly technical and deals with issues such as gated spillways and construction of parapets and heights of turbine installations. 

 But that did not prevent Islamabad and Delhi from fighting inch by inch to get their positions accepted by Lafitte in view of the potential of the verdict to influence the overall course of India-Pakistan dialogue, according to World Bank officials.

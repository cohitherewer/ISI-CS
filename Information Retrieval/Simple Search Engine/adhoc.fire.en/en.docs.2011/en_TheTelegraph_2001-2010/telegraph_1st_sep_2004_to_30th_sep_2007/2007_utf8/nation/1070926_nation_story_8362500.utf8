The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Karunas Onam olive branch

 Malayalis of Chennai were jubilant this Onam. In a goodwill gesture, M. Karunanidhi conceded their long-pending request to declare the festival a holiday, even if the order wasnt made binding.

 In Coimbatore, Kanyakumari and Niligiri districts, bordering Kerala, Onam has been a holiday. But Chennai, home to a large number of Malayalis, had so far been denied a day off. 

 This time, though, the scowls on many faces gave way to smiles and the celebrations appeared to have greater vigour. There was instant applause for Karunanidhi, who was seen to have put inter-state problems with the neighbouring state the festering row over the Mullai Periyar dam issue and the creation of a new rail division at Salem (Tamil Nadu) by bringing some Kerala pockets into its fold behind him and honour the sentiment of Malayalees. 

 In Onam programmes across Chennai, the chief minister and daughter Kanimozhi received a warm welcome amid hopes the holiday declaration would create the trust needed to solve the old problems between the two states.

 Turning point with buses

 Buses with low floorboards will soon be seen across Delhi. Over the next two months, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) plans to introduce 500 of them on routes across the city. 

 The floorboards of these buses are merely a foot above street level. The existing ones have steps about two feet high. The new buses have been structured keeping in mind the needs of the elderly and the differently abled. 

 The buses are not entirely new; they have remained restricted to a few routes. 

 Five low-floorboard buses ply between Connaught Place and the Indian Institute of Technology in Hauz Khas.

 This route, number 620, was successfully used as a trial run for the new buses. Earlier this year, such buses were also introduced in the congested Chandni Chowk area. 

 MLA kitty for English skills

 A minister who couldnt make it to college is spending government funds at his disposal on spreading English language skills.

 Sericulture minister S. Shivanna dropped out after Class XII but he has ensured that copies of his Learn and Teach English dossier reach school students in his constituency.

 The initiative has been financed from the local area development fund, a kitty available to all MLAs but used mostly to finance basic amenities like roads and bus shelters.

 When countries such as China and Japan are imparting English to their children, India should not lag behind, Shivanna says. A little investment is all that it takes. 

 The minister has earmarked Rs 5 lakh for the knowledge project. I do not want the children in my Assembly constituency to lag in the job market when they grow up merely because they lack English language skills, Shivanna says. The easy-to-learn dossier isnt all. The students will soon be getting free dictionaries. 

 On fast lane

 There is hope for Delhiites who have to stand in never-ending queues to get vehicle registration papers and licences.

 The government has decided to set up six more regional transport offices across the city. When these come up, there will be 13 such offices to manage the rush. 

 Sukhdev Vihar, Vasant Vihar, Hauz Khas, Suraj Mal, Burari and Wazirabad are the locations for the new offices. These will also have traffic-education centres to sensitise people about road rules and safety norms. Over three lakh licences are issued every six months in the capital. 

 Delhi: Students of Sri Ram Centre for Performing Arts present Spartacus, the immortal tale of a slave who rebelled against the powerful Roman empire, this Wednesday. The venue is the Centre for Performing Arts on Safdar Hashmi Marg, near the Mandi House Metro station. Time: 6.30pm.

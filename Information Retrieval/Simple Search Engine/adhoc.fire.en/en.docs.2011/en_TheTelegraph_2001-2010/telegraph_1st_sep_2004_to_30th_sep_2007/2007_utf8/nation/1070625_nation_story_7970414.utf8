 Rain shiver in Mumbai

 Mumbai, June 24: Old Mumbai is living in dread but New Mumbai is seeing an opportunity in the rains lashing the metropolis.

 At least five persons lost their lives in rain-triggered incidents, mostly roof and wall cave-ins, as normal life sunk in the seasons first big downpour over the weekend.

 Old buildings and shanties were the biggest death traps. A partially demolished building collapsed in the Grant Road area last evening, killing two persons and injuring as many.

 This morning, two died and three were wounded after a wall caved in on tenements in Chembur. A six-year-old girl perished in a similar incident in Kandivali, police said. 

 But as many waded through waterlogged streets and markets saw a scramble to stock up on groceries, some lunged at straws of hope.

 These were the much-maligned cable operators, laid low by the DTH revolution. The cable operators claimed they were getting calls from customers for set-top boxes and renewal of subscriptions after thunderstorms caused problems in DTH antennas.

 DTH customers were frustrated as many of the antennas do not work properly during lightning and thunderstorms. We have been flooded with calls from our old clients asking for set-top boxes or renewal of cable connections, said Mohammed Hassan Alichi of Gems Cable Vision in the upscale Pali Hill area of Bandra. 

 Dish TV admitted snags but said these were being fixed. A Tata Sky official echoed him. These are one-off cases. We have serviced all our mini-dishes (antennas) before monsoon. There is no large-scale problem, said Ashish Babu, head of corporate communications at Tata Sky.

 As the downpour revived dark memories of the July 26, 2005, deluge, anger at the civic authorities began to swell.

 But Jairaj Phatak, commissioner of Brihanmumbai Corporation, blamed the waterlogging on excessive rain. The drainage system can deal with rainfall of 40mm per hour. Beyond that limit, there is bound to be some waterlogging, but it should clear out within an hour or two. The average rainfall today was around 300mm.

 Mayor Shubha Kaul insisted that the civic body was ready for any eventuality.

 Local trains, Mumbais lifeline, were running up to 20 minutes late a big delay for the average officegoer. 

 Flights were running late up to two hours but, barring a few services to Ahmedabad and Jaipur, there were no cancellations.

 Grim forecast

 The roads were free today because it was a Sunday, but those hitting the streets on Monday should expect snarls. The Met department has forecast more rains over the next 24 hours.

 Ahmedabad, May 14: A CNG bus turned into a fireball yards away from where a truck rammed an LPG tanker this evening, roasting at least 28 people to death.

 The state transport bus was behind the truck which, along with the tanker, burst into flames after the 6.45 pm collision in Anand, central Gujarat. The leaking LPG set the bus, too on fire.

 Most of the dead were passengers of the bus, travelling from Mehsana in north Gujarat to Godhra, but at least four local villagers standing nearby were killed, too.

 About 30 injured were being treated in hospitals in Anand and Vadodara tonight, with four stated to be critical.

 Although fire brigade personnel counted 28 deaths, state law minister Ashok Bhatt confirmed only 24. But the minister, who has rushed to the accident site at Vasad, 6 km from Anand on National Highway 8, admitted that the toll could be higher.

 Rescue operations are still on and the death count will be known after we take all the injured to hospital, which is our priority at the moment, Bhatt said.

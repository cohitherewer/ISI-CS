 Blame on bed or bash for bad back

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, Feb. 16: Some say the soft-till-you-sink hotel beds he slept in during the West Indies and Sri Lanka series could be the culprit.

 Others say the surprise wife Anjali organised at his favourite Martins Corner the celeb shack restaurant on Goas Betalbatim beach and the Crab Butter Garlic he gorged on there could have taken its toll.

 How his favourite Goan dish could have played spoilsport is anyones guess, but with all of India worrying about Sachin Tendulkars sore back, opinions are flying fast and loose.

 Whatever the case, it certainly does not seem like a serious condition to me. I read in the papers that Sachin is in Mumbai. If his back problem was anything major, he would have contacted me, said Mumbai-based orthopaedic surgeon Anant Joshi.

 Sachin has been under Joshis care for years.

 His back problem first showed up during the Chennai Test in 1999 when Pakistan was touring India. India lost that Test despite a gritty century from Sachin. 

 When the problem surfaced again later that year during a training camp before the teams departure to Sri Lanka and Singapore, Sachin started consulting doctors.

 Sports medicine doctors suspect Sachins back problem could be linked to a bio-mechanical injury resulting from the high-velocity rotational activity that using a heavy bat Sachin uses one entails.

 A senior sports medicine doctor said heavy bats put batters at risk of injury to a region of the lower back called the pars intra-articularis.

 This is the thinnest region of the vertebrae, said Jaspal Sandhu, president of the Indian Association of Sports Medicine. High speed rotational activity puts both batters and golfers at risk of injury to this area.

 The recommendation for injuries to the pars intra-articularis is adequate rest, lasting up to four weeks.

 IIT, IIM grants for minority students

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 21: The government today cleared a new scholarship scheme for students from minority communities studying at elite technical institutes such as the IITs and IIMs.

 The government will select 20,000 students from minority communities every year to grant them scholarships, which will come in two forms maintenance allowance and course fee. Thirty per cent of the scholarships will be reserved for girls.

 The cabinet committee on economic affairs has endorsed the project drafted by the ministry of minority affairs. 

 The Rs 761-crore merit-cum-means scheme is particularly aimed at students in IITs, IIMs and AIIMS, said finance minister P. Chidambaram. 

 The scholarship pattern is based on existing schemes for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates. 

 An income ceiling has recently been imposed on the caste-based scholarship only SC/ST students whose parents earn less than Rs 2 lakh per annum are eligible. The minority scheme does not have an income ceiling as of now. 

 Five communities designated as minority Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis and Buddhists will be covered by the scheme. 

 Apart from the IITs and IIMs, the scheme would apply to select engineering colleges, management schools, law institutes and medical colleges.

 The announcement is part of a series of steps taken by the UPA government for the social uplift of the minority groups. A scholarship scheme for higher secondary and senior school level education is also in the pipeline.

 In a rush to fulfil promises made in the Common Minimum Programme, the government has cleared a minority upliftment plan in which key projects would be specially directed at the marginal communities. 

 Redefining the word minority as well as the role of the national commission for religious and linguistic minorities, and a 15-point programme are among the projects on the table.

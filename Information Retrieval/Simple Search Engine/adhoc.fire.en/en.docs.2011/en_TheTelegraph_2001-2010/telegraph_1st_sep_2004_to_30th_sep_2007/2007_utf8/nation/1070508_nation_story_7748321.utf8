 PM meets Left on President poll

 Manmohan Singh

 New Delhi, May 7: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh got the ball rolling on the presidential election by holding consultations with Left leaders over the weekend.

 Singh met the CPM and CPI general secretaries, Prakash Karat and A.B. Bardhan, separately on Friday and Saturday.

 Left and Congress sources said the broad points on which they agreed were that A.P.J. Abdul Kalam should not get a second term and that Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat should not be elevated to the Presidents post.

 According to the Left sources, Karat and Bardhan made it clear to the Prime Minister that they wanted a political incumbent in Rashtrapati Bhavan, a person who understood the Constitution and politics and not an apolitical intellectual.

 The Left leaders indicated to Singh that they were not keen on putting up a nominee but would rather let the Congress throw up two or three names, which could be discussed with UPA allies and other secular parties to evolve a broad consensus, they added.

 The two are believed to have emphasised that the Tamil Nadu allies, the DMK and the PMK, should be firmly on board so that there was no hint of a north-south divide on the candidate.

 They also pressed for the need to get the support of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and, if possible, the Samajwadi Party, despite the Congresss acrimony with Mulayam Singh Yadav. 

 Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh had told a press conference last Saturday that if the Left proposed its candidate, his party would be willing to back him. 

 The partys strategy would depend on the outcome of the Uttar Pradesh elections and on the permutations and combinations that emerge in case of a hung Assembly.

 The political establishment believes that if the Congress helps install Mayavatis BSP in power, there is little or no chance of getting Mulayams help to elect the next occupant of Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 Vijay Krishna, a Lok Sabha MP of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, circulated a note to his party colleagues, asking them to back former Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basu for the job. 

 However, RJD chief Lalu Prasad told The Telegraph today: That may be his personal initiative. We will take a call only after holding wider consultations with the Congress, UPA and the Left.

 Asked if the Congress had thought of any names from the party, a source said: Our leaders have been preoccupied with the Uttar Pradesh elections so far. Some discussion could take place tomorrow or the day after.

 The matter might be discussed on May 11 in Chennai, where the Congress, Left and UPA leaders will congregate to celebrate the golden jubilee of M. Karunanidhis legislative career. 

 The Prime Minister, Sonia Gandhi, Karat, Bardhan, Lalu Prasad, Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan and Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar are expected to attend the event that will end with a public meeting.

 Karunanadhi, the Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK boss, is expected to host a dinner for his allies that night. Sources said it would be followed by a discussion on the presidential candidate.

 Yerwada, reel to real 

 ANANYA SENGUPTA

 Sanjay Dutt and Tabu in a still from Sarhad Paar

 Pune, Aug. 6: Sanjay Dutt has been to Yerwada jail and back.

 As a Bombay blasts convict, he landed behind its bars last Thursday. But as an Indian PoW in a Pakistani jail, he was there four years ago.

 Thanks to director Raman Kumar, who cast Sanjay as a Sikh soldier who strayed across the border and was jailed in Sarhad Paar, the star got his first taste of Yerwada in 2003.

 It was a pleasure working with Sanjay. He played an army man called Ranjit Singh, who was declared missing in action after he accidentally crossed the border. I showed the interiors of Yerwada as a jail in Punjab as I couldnt get to the actual location, Kumar said.

 At that time, however, Sanjay did not have a six-year jail term staring at him. He shot for the film for some 10 days and left.

 People who live near Yerwada still remember Sanjays towering frame relaxing on a bed of rocks just outside the jail, as he took a breather between shots.

 I saw him about four years back. He was shooting for a film here. He was standing and smoking with his foot propped on a rock in front of this very jail, recalled movie buff Avinash Singh as he waited for a glimpse of his beloved baba.

 I havent been able to see him this time. I know that if I see him, I will feel the difference. At that time, he had a nice physique and stubble all over his face. But now, in pictures in the papers, he looks gaunt and tired.

 Sarhad Paar, which had Tabu playing Sanjays girlfriend and Mahima Chaudhury his sister, was released last year but bombed at the box office. 

 It was touted as the first major film to be released simultaneously in 500 theatres in India.

 Nimbus Communications, which produced the film, had begun with a budget of Rs 15 crore. But the budget is believed to have skyrocketed because of delays caused by Sanjays court cases.

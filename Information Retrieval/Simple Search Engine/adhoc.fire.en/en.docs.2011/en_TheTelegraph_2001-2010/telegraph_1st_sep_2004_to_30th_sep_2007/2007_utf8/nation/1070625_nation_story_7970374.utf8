The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Left eyes Shekhawats post

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 24: Left parties are expected to start the next round of discussions for the election to the Vice-Presidents post soon after the presidential poll ends.

 The CPM, CPI and their allies have already indicated that if the Presidents post goes to the Congress, that of the Vice-President should go to a non-Congress UPA candidate. Congress sources have confirmed that as of now, party leaders have accepted the Lefts proposal.

 A senior Left leader told The Telegraph that though no names have been discussed even informally between them, they were clear that the criteria used to choose a presidential candidate should be repeated in this case with an addition: the person should be able to conduct the House. The Vice-President is also the Rajya Sabha chairman and presides over the proceedings of the Upper House.

 Needless to say, the candidate should be political, secular and experienced but need not necessarily be a member of Parliament, said the leader, pointing out that Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, who is now the Vice-President, came straight from the Rajasthan Assembly to the Rajya Sabha.

 Going by the process of elimination, it appears that the Left has a lead over UPA constituents in staking claim to the post.

 There were reports that the DMK and the BSP, both weighty allies, may pitch for it. 

 DMK chief M. Karunanidhi had his finance minister A. Anbazhagan in mind.

 The Tamil Nadu chief minister wanted to ensure an honourable exit for his long-time comrade before he handed over the reins of power to his son M.K. Stalin. His worry was how Anbazhagan, who is older than him, could possibly work under Stalin.

 But Anbazhagan reportedly put his foot down and insisted he would not move to Delhi.

 For a while, the Congress believed that BSP chief Mayavati might ask for the Vice-Presidents post for one of her senior Rajya Sabha members, Gandhi Azad. But the word from the BSP was the lady did not want a parallel power centre in Delhi or anoint any member to a post that would unshackle him from her regimen and rules.

 No third candidate

 The third front would not field a candidate for the presidential poll, Om Prakash Chautala, one of its leaders, said today. One thing is certain: we will not put up our candidate. We dont want to become the subject of a joke, he said.

 Online air ticket fraud caught

 Mumbai, Jan. 25 (PTI): A person who booked over 15,000 air tickets worth around Rs 13.47 crore on the Net using stolen credit card data has been arrested.

 Imran Ahmed Shaikh, 27, was picked up on Tuesday for his involvement in a group that booked tickets online by stealing data on credit cards used in hotels and malls.

 The group used the card number, expiry date and the unique customer verification value (CVV), printed on cards, to buy tickets of Kingfisher Airlines and sold them to others at discounted rates.

 Mumbai polices economic offences wing, which is probing the case, said the group had booked 15,255 Kingfisher tickets between June 2005 and November 2006. 

 The police said they are looking for Samir Kasam Shaikh, a relative of Imran and the suspected mastermind. Samir had allegedly floated a company KGN Aviations along with two associates. While Samir usually booked tickets from a cyber cafe in central Mumbai, the other two helped sell them, the police said. 

 Samir had been arrested by Thane polices crime branch in a cheating case in February last year, but was freed on bail within a week. 

 Imran, booked under Sections 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating), was produced before a local court, which remanded him in police custody till February 7.

 Zubair Chaudhary, legal adviser to Kingfisher Airlines, had gone to the police last month after complaints from people who were billed for tickets they never purchased.

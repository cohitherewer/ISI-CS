 Sheila faces migrant music

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN AND CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, May 10: Chief minister Sheila Dikshit today apologised for her remarks against Delhis heartland migrants after Pranab Mukherjee asked her to.

 Inaugurating a 21st-century flyover in west Delhi yesterday, Dikshit had complained about how the burgeoning migrant population was burdening the capitals infrastructure.

 In the Lok Sabha today, Opposition members rocked the house with their protests against the chief ministers comments.

 In a CD supplied by the chief ministers office, Dikshit was quoted as saying: Delhi is considered to be the most prosperous city. People from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and other states come here. What to do? Yahaan koi kanoon nahin hai, ki hum kahe tham jao, mat ao (there is no law here so that we can tell them to stop coming).

 She added: They come here to earn their daily bread. But once in Delhi, nobody, be it a bureaucrat or politician, wants to leave. 

 Even some Congress MLAs, especially those with origins in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, joined the Opposition in demanding Dikshits resignation, forcing the House to be adjourned. 

 Mukherjee, the external affairs minister and leader of the Lok Sabha, then summoned Dikshit to his office, where parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi was also present.

 They told her that nothing short of an apology would do, given the sensitive nature of her comments. 

 They pointed out the political significance of the migrants, who usually vote in large numbers for the Congress. 

 The BJP accused Dikshit of double standards. She came to the CMs seat with votes from the very people she is accusing of over-populating Delhi and stretching its infrastructure, said Delhi BJP chief Harsha Vardhan. 

 Vardhans ally in Maharashtra, Bal Thackerays Shiv Sena, often ups the ante against migrants from other states into Mumbai. But that clearly was not on Vardhans mind.

 An initially reluctant Dikshit agreed to apologise at a news conference. The chief minister said she did not intend to hurt anybodys sentiments. 

 I am fully aware of the contributions made by people coming from outside, especially from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, to the development of Delhi, she said. 

 RJD chief Lalu Prasad said the matter should now be closed.

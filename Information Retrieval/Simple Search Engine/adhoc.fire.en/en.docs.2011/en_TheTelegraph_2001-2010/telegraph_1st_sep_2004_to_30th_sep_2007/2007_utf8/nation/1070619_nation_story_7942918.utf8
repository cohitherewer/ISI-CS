 Hugs and handshakes? Not in school, please

 ANANYA SENGUPTA 

 PDA problem

 Mumbai, June 18: Boys and girls who hug each other after a basketball win will be in trouble at Jamnabai Narsee School. And at Vibgyor High School, even handshakes are out.

 The two co-ed schools here have warned pupils against PDA (public displays of affection) in writing, dividing opinion among teachers, students and parents.

 Jamnabai, run by the Narsee Monjee Educational Trust in Vile Parle, declared in its annual calendar a zero tolerance policy for display of affection which is not acceptable to society at large.

 Vibgyor of Goregaon, in the parents manual on its website, prohibits any unwarranted touching among students. And, of course, any midriff-baring.

 Both principals have promised harsh punishment for violation.

 We have to be very careful dealing with teens on the verge of adulthood. Its so easy for them to get carried away. They watch movies, flip through magazines and are exposed through the media to all that is happening, Jamnabai principal J. Vas said.

 Recently they were all discussing the kiss between Aishwarya Rai and Hrithik Roshan (in Dhoom 2) and the Shilpa Shetty-Richard Gere kiss (at an HIV/AIDS function). They still dont understand the significance of physical contact. They have to be reined in.

 Rustom Kerawalla, Vibgyor High trustee, agrees. We have banned all forms of touching. Students mustnt think its cool to hold hands and hug in school.

 Some parents believe the ban would tickle their childrens curiosity about the other gender. I have sent my boy to a co-ed school so he learns to interact with girls. He knows where to draw the line, one said.

 Another differed: Its important that children understand its not necessary to touch and hug your classmates to interact with them. I agree with the schools.

 The students are none too happy. I have studied in a co-ed school all my life. We treat female classmates just the way we treat our male friends, a boy said.

 We are casual with one another; we backslap one another when we win a competition and hug when we are ecstatic. Its not done with bad intentions, said another.

 Myrtle Barsa, sociology teacher at MMK College, welcomed the bans. She said that as a teacher with the State University of New York earlier, she had been shocked at the extent of PDA among the students.

 Parents should understand our society is different. Our children havent been exposed to sex education. Parents are hesitant to discuss sex with their children, she said.

 This means kids learn through imitation, which can be dangerous. They have to be prepared to deal with their feelings first. I hope undergraduate colleges, too, take this on board.

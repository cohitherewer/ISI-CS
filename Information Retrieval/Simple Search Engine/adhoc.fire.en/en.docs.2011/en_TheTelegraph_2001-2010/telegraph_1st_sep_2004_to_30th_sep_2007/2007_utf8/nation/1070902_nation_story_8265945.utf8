 Spyker banks on Indian spark

 Sept. 1: The Spyker F1 team that MP and tycoon Vijay Mallya is set to acquire has had a troubled history in Europe, full of pit stops at every corner.

 Now it hopes to hit the fast track, powered by the fuel of booming economy and great opportunity that India offers.

 Dutch luxury sports car maker Spyker Cars NV had acquired the F1 team, then named Jordan, from the Midland Group for $106.6 million (Rs 438 crore) in September 2006. Midland had bought it from the legendary Eddie Jordan.

 Spyker Cars has been cash-strapped after a net loss of 29.9 million euros (Rs 167 crore), and expects to make a loss this year, too.

 The F1 team posted a loss of 13 million euros (Rs 73 crore) and is bottom of the table with no points after 12 races this year. Adrian Sutil of Germany and Sakon Yamamoto of Japan are its two drivers.

 India has a booming economy and is a country with great opportunity. I am looking forward to make this a competitive Indian-Dutch combination, said Spyker director Michiel Mol, Mallyas partner who will own half the company.

 With the resources Vijay Mallya brings I am confident the F1 team has a very bright future.

 In the middle of August, Spyker had announced it might sell some or all of its F1 team. Mallyas UB Group has annual revenues of over $3 billion (Rs 12,330 crore) and a market capitalisation of about $5 billion (Rs 20,550 crore).

 Onward to India

 The acquisition is likely to boost Mallyas efforts to bring F1 to India. F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone has begun talks to put India on the racing map.

 F1 track designer Hermann Tilke, who has designed the new circuits at Shanghai and Bahrain, recently visited India to consider the options, one of which is a street-race circuit in Delhi like the one at Monaco.

 Mallya recently got Ralf Schumacher of the Toyota F1 team to meet Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit.

 The businessman is the chairman of the Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India, the government-recognised national sporting body, and the Motor Sports Association of India, the current FIA association for India.

 Karthikeyan link

 Indias association with F1 has been tenuous: Narain Karthikeyan was a rookie driver for Jordan in 2005 and is now a test driver with Williams.

 Since Spyker traces its history to Jordan, Indian racing aficionados may long to see Karthikeyan clamber back into a hotrod on race day.

 Karthikeyan, however, is a brand ambassador for Tata Motors and much will depend on whether the parties can resolve all the issues.

 Indias other F1 connection is through Tata Consultancy Services, which teamed up with Ferrari in December 2004. TCS provides IT and engineering services to Scuderia Ferrari for the development of F1 cars. 

 It also provides IT solutions for the racing cars popular cousin, the Ferrari sports car.

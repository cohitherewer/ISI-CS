 Amar quotes price: machher jhol

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, May 19: When Mamata Banerjee spotted Amar Singh in Parliaments Central Hall on Wednesday, she was a bit intrigued. 

 Like many others, the Trinamul Congress MP, too, had heard that the Samajwadi Party general secretary was in hospital, ailing and incommunicado. 

 Mamata went up to him and bluntly asked what he was doing in Parliament. Amars answer was if she wanted an update on his life and times, he should be treated to a nice Bengali meal.

 Mamata invited him to one the next day. Mindful that Amar was diabetic, she rustled up a meal of boiled rice and machher jhol without embellishments like bhaja and chutney.

 Mamatas gesture would have passed off as another gracious overture to an old buddy except that the whole thing happened in the backdrop of the capitals big political preoccupation this summer: who will be the next President? 

 A source close to the Trinamul leader refused to say what was discussed because it was supposed to be a one-to-one meeting. 

 But considering that Amar had made statements on the Samajwadi Partys behalf a day before on the presidential poll and Mamata was proactive on the NDAs behalf, a fair surmise was that the issue would have figured at the 45-minute lunch meet.

 While Amar had told reporters that his party would not back an NDA nominee, he was reportedly ambiguous on how it would handle the UPA candidate, especially if he was from the Congress. 

 He only said the Samajwadi Party would support a Left candidate. 

 The BJP had approached him a day earlier. The buzz in the party circles was if Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat was put up, Amar might root for a fellow Thakur. 

 Mamatas choice for the next Rashtrapati Bhavan incumbent was Atal Bihari Vajpayee. She proposed his name at an NDA meeting earlier this week but Vajpayees office negated it in a statement the very next day. 

 BJP sources, however, stressed that she was irrevocably a part of the NDA. 

 Amars isolation in the Central Hall Mamata was one of the few who went up to him was in stark contrast to the adulation heaped on Satish Chandra Mishra a day later. 

 As soon as Mayavatis political aide, a Rajya Sabha MP, took his seat, he was mobbed by everybody. So much so that P. Chidambaram and Motilal Vora had to wait their turn to shake hands with the former lawyer.

 While Chidambaram spent a couple of minutes with Mishra, Vora was with him for over 10 minutes. The reason? Mayavati is supposedly keen to send a heartland Brahmin to Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 The Congress doesnt have too many of them since the pedigreed Brahmin families, which sent luminaries like Kamlapati Tripathi, H.N. Bahuguna, Uma Shankar Dikshit and Rajendra Vajpayee, have lapsed into political oblivion. 

 The only remnant from the era is N.D. Tiwari. But the former Uttarakhand chief minister is not a favourite of Congress president Sonia Gandhi. 

 Vora is a Brahmin from Madhya Pradesh. While he doesnt have lineage on his side, there is no doubt about his loyalty to 10 Janpath.

 Fresh blot on Bangalores face

 ANIL BUDUR LULLA

 An autorickshaw burnt by the mob on Sunday

 Bangalore, Jan. 22: Bangalore has had a long history of communal clashes, with vote-bank politics alleged to be the main culprit.

 Sundays flare-up in which a 12-year-old fell to bullet injuries added another blood-stained chapter to that history. The incident, at an RSS meeting, came two days after former Congress MP C.K. Jaffer Shariefs rally to protest against Saddam Husseins hanging had turned violent.

 With a sizeable Muslim population and an equal number of Hindus, Shivaji Nagar and its neighbouring Bharti Nagar and Fraser Town form the citys most sensitive belt. For their rallies, Sharief and Sangh chose that very area, which can turn into a battlefield even over an India-Pakistan cricket match. 

 Roshan Baig, a Congress MLA from the neighbouring Jayamahal Assembly constituency, said he knew there would be violence on Sunday. I got many calls on my mobile warning of clashes. I even visited the police commissioners office to inform police, but no one listened, he alleged.

 The police said that they were prepared for any eventuality but were caught unawares as some rallyists unleashed violence before entering the sensitive core. 

 The 12-year-old victim of police firing remained unidentified today, with no one coming to claim the body despite an ex gratia of Rs 1 lakh to his family announced by state home minister M.P. Prakash.

 Prakash held Sharief responsible for Sundays clash, which saw at least 100 buses and many private cars set on fire. We will act against all those who were responsible, even if they are peoples representatives, he said.

 However, the minister refused to comment on why the police had allowed the Sangh rally despite tension in the area since Friday. A police officer, on condition of anonymity, said the green signal came as the government did not want to hurt the ego of its coalition partner, the BJP.

 The man in the eye of the storm, Sharief, pleaded innocence. Punish me if I have done wrong. What can I do if some misguided youths take to the streets, he said. 

 The former MP, who was apparently trying to revive his flagging political career through his pro-Saddam rants, is now clearly on the back foot. A group of Muslims gheraoed him today at a hospital he visited.

 The last time the city saw such fury spilling on the streets was during Kannada film icon Rajkumars funeral. The rampage left eight persons dead, seven of them in police firing.

 Neighbouring Mangalore got its first taste of communal violence after some RSS activists stopped a truck carrying cattle to an abattoir.

 The Baba Budangiri hills in Chikmagalur, too, have been simmering with a dispute raging over a Sufi shrine.

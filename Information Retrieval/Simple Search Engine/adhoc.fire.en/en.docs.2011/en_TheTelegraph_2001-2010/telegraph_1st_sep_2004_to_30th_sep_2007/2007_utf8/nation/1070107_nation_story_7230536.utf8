 Forensic tests

 Ahmedabad, Jan. 6: Moninder Singh Pandher, the main accused in the Noida killings, and his servant today underwent lie-detection and brain fingerprinting tests at the Gandhinagar forensic laboratory. 

 However, their narco-analysis test will begin only after doctors give the go-ahead as Pandher has been found to be a diabetic during his physical fitness examination at the Gandhinagar civil hospital.

 Laboratory officials could not specify when these tests would be over.

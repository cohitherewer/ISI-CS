 Do-gooder nun in drug spot

 The price you have to pay for being a Samaritan! A Catholic nun, who takes classes for inmates of the Madurai Central Jail, landed in a spot when she was found carrying a packet of ganja and a SIM card. 

 Sister Cherry Beena, though, thought it contained medicines for a prisoner, according to prison officials.

 An elderly lady, introducing herself as a relative of an AIDS-afflicted inmate, had approached Beena as she was about to enter the prison, an official said. She asked the nun to hand over the packet of medicines to the prisoner.

 Beena, who has been taking classes regularly at the jail for over a year, could not believe her eyes when guards at the prison gate fished out the ganja and the SIM card. 

 During interrogation, the nun said she was not aware of the contents. The officials said they have taken a statement from the nun and the convent authorities can take action against her if they want.

 They added that social workers coming to the prison would be thoroughly frisked in the future.

 Slimming lessons in schools

 Catch em young and make em slim.

 After a decade of targeting middle-aged and over-the-hill women, a weight loss centre has decided to nip the fat in the bud.

 Vandana Luthras Curls and Curves has joined hands with four schools in Noida to curb obesity among children. 

 Our focus will be, quite simply, on educating the children through innovative programmes about the benefits of remaining fit and slim, said Rekha Sharma, the chief of the centres research wing. 

 Ryan International School, Cambridge School, Delhi Public School and Amity International School have signed up with VLCC, she added. 

 The programmes will target trans-fat present in plant oils and dairy and meat products which is responsible for most coronary diseases. 

 Research shows that the age at which the average human develops heart diseases is getting lower, and it is a major cause for concern, Sharma said. 

 Loot, in the name of God

 Want to see God? The question is a sure to turn heads. Imtiaz and Usman cashed in on it and how!

 Usman would draw peoples attention on the road and throw this question. His partner in crime Imtiaz, pretending to be a passerby, would show interest.

 According to the plan, Usman would then ask Imtiaz to leaving his chain, rings and other belongings behind. 

 An incense stick in hand, he would set off for his date with divinity as others would stare in disbelief. Disappearing for a few minutes, Imtiaz would run back screaming that he has seen God.

 An unsuspecting victim would follow suit, only to watch the incense stick turn to ash and no God in sight. In the meantime, the duo would run off with his possessions. 

 But the good times didnt last too long. The cons are now cooling their heels in jail.

 Holiday? Too hot

 When the heat political and otherwise gets to M. Karunanidhi, he heads to visit his daughter in Bangalore. 

 But this summer has turned out to be more scorching than he had imagined, forcing him to think twice about his annual trip. 

 First, theres the family feud an apparent one between his two sons over whos the better heir to the DMK throne and the out-in-the-open clash between Karunanidhi and his great nephew Dayanidhi Maran. 

 Another boiling issue is the Cauvery dispute with Karnataka. With Karunanidhi not mincing words after the river tribunals final award in favour of his neighbour, Kannada activists have threatened to stage a protest and gherao him if he sets foot in the Karnataka capital.

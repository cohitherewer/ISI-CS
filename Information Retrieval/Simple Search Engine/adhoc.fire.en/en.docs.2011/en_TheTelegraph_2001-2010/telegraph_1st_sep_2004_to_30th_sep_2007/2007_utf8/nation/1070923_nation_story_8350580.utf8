 Rahul set for baptism

 Rahul Gandhi 

 New Delhi, Sept. 22: Rahul Gandhis induction as a Congress general secretary looks almost certain and not too far away.

 Congress chief Sonia Gandhi is expected to announce organisational changes next week before leaving for the UN general assembly, sources said.

 Earlier, it was believed the changes would be made after state units were revamped. But nothing much has been done barring the replacement of Delhi Congress chief Ram Babu Sharma by J.P. Aggarwal two weeks ago.

 Now with snap polls looming, the party feels it would be a better idea to shore up the central organisation first. Rahuls formal entry at this point would be the perfect antidote for a besieged party, the sources said.

 There has been a sense, of late, that the organisations political reflexes are not quick enough. It has also been found wanting in shaping responses to topical issues.

 Rahul is, however, unlikely to be burdened with a specific responsibility like minding a state. He may be put in charge of frontal organisations the National Students Union of India or the Seva Dal as this will give him the space to interact with workers across the country.

 The workers of frontal organisations were the Congresss foot soldiers till decades of being the ruling party created other power centres. Rahuls induction is expected to galvanise these outfits.

 The sources said the sooner Rahul was brought in, the better it would be for him. Recalling how he had been put on the Uttar Pradesh campaign trail too late, a source said: We dont want to repeat the experience.

 The Congress shake-up could also decide the role of two former chief ministers who are now general secretaries: Digvijay Singh and Ashok Gehlot.

 Gehlot has indicated he would like to return to Rajasthan. But many feel his backward-caste antecedents may again end up damaging the party as none of the major communities Jats, Rajputs and Meenas are happy with him.

 The Congress is undecided on what Gehlots designation would be if he went back. Some said state chief B.D. Kalla, a Brahmin, could be changed but opinion was divided on whether Gehlot was the best replacement.

 Digvijays return to Madhya Pradesh could be more problematic. He would have to contend with many power centres, including Jyotiraditya Scindia, Suresh Pachauri, state unit chief Subhash Yadav and Arjun Singhs son Rahul.

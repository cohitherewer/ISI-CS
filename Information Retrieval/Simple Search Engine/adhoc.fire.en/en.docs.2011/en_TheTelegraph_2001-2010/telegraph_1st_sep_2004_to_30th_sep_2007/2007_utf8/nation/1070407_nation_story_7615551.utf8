 Sarabjit sister on fast unto death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, April 6: Dalbir Kaur, the sister of Sarabjit Singh who is a death-row convict in Lahores Kotkapura Jail, today began a fast unto death to protest against the governments false assurances on securing his release.

 It is now or never. I have also written to the Prime Minister that if steps are not taken to repatriate Sarabjit, I will commit suicide in front of his residence, threatened Dalbir, who lives in Bhikhiwind village near Amritsar. 

 Similar letters have been sent to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Opposition leader L.K. Advani, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, home minister Shivraj Patil, Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and Amritsar MP Navjot Singh Sidhu as well as the National Human Rights Commission.

 Sarabjit is charged with spying for the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in Pakistan and involvement in blasts in Lahore and Multan that killed several people. The Pakistan government says Sarabjit is actually Manjeet, a RAW operative. Dalbir, however, denies her brother had anything to do with RAW and claims that a drunk Sarabjit strayed into Pakistan on August 28, 1990. It is a case of mistaken identity, she said over the phone. 

 The entire family has been living on false assurances. We were told by the foreign minister that Sarabjit would be released on January 11. Two months have passed and there is no word from either the Pakistani or the Indian government on the issue.

 In her letter, Dalbir said the government did not seem interested in getting Sarabjit released. She also urged the President to send a special envoy to Pakistan to visit the jail and provide medical aid to Sarabjit, who is in solitary confinement there.

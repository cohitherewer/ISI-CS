 Jail for ex-CM

 Nar Bahadur Bhandari

Gangtok, May 28: Former Sikkim chief minister Nar Bahadur Bhandari was sentenced to a months simple imprisonment and fined Rs 5,000 by a special court that found his income disproportionate to his assets. 

 If the fine is not paid, the president of the Sikkim Pradesh Congress Commi- ttee will have to be in jail for another 15 days. 

 Bhandari, in his late sixties, was present in court today when special judge S.W. Lepcha read out the sentence. 

 The former chief minister, however, was granted bail after he furnished a personal bond of Rs 25,000. 

 On Saturday, the special court had found him guilty of amassing Rs 22 lakh during his stint as chief minister from 1979 to 1984, when his known sources of income during that period was a little above Rs 5 lakh.

 The Rs 22 lakh included Rs 15.22 lakh spent on a five-storey house. 

 The CBI, which probed Bhandaris assets, had pleaded for a maximum term of seven years, but Bhandaris counsel had argued for a lesser sentence citing his clients age and failing health. 

 Bhandari has decided to appeal in a higher court.

 Monica music

 A Bhopal court on Thursday played sweet music to Monica Bedis ears by upholding her acquittal in a passport case and passing severe strictures against the government machinery.

 Bhopal district sessions court judge Renu Sharma said the government should take action against those responsible for issuing the fake passport. 

 A lower court had earlier said Monicas complicity in the fraud could not be established. The government had appealed against the order in the higher court.

 But the sessions court on Thursday concurred with the earlier order of acquittal.

 Monica (at the Bhopal court in PTI picture) profusely thanked the judiciary, saying the judges observations sounded like sweet music. 

 Justice has been done, said the aspiring actress who got sucked into a relationship with gangster Abu Salem.

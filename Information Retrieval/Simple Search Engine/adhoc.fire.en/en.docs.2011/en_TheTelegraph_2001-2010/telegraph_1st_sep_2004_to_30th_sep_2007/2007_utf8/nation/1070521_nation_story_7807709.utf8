 Son-of-soil raid on rail test

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 20: The son-of-the-soil virus has passed from the uncle to the nephew.

 Activists of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), the breakaway party floated by Bal Thackerays nephew Raj Thackeray, today disrupted a railway recruitment test being taken by several north Indian candidates.

 Alleging that the share of sons of the soil in the job pie is shrinking, the activists raided the venue of the test. Around 300 students from different parts of the country were taking the test.

 A group stormed Punes Abasaheb Atre Prashala, one of the test venues, and allegedly beat up the candidates from north India and tore their answer sheets. It was all planned. We did this to protest the fact that not one of the 300 candidates belonged to Maharashtra. The recruitment advertisements didnt appear in any local papers, MNS spokesperson Shishir Shinde said. 

 But Shinde denied his men beat up any student. We have a style of forcefully entering a venue, and when we do so, people automatically get frightened. We didnt let the examination take place, Shinde said. Why should we beat anyone? Our grievances are against the central government and not against outsiders. 

 Police, however, contested Shindes claim, saying some students who hesitated or refused to hand over their answer sheets were manhandled.

 The centre in-charge has filed a case against the MNS activists, and the police later arrested eight of them. The railways denied Shindes allegation, saying that in line with norms, advertisements had been placed in local newspapers and Employment News, which is available throughout the country.

 There has been no favouritism. Around 14,000 candidates had applied for the exam and about 50 per cent had come for the tests in Punes 27 centres. We have had no problems in other places, a Central Railway spokesperson said.

 Asked whether the examination at the centre would be cancelled in view of the disruption, he said the railway authorities have not taken any decision so far. The railway spokesperson said the test was conducted to fill vacancies for motormen, loco-pilots, signal and telecom engineers. 

 Prashant Suri, who hails from Delhi and works as a producer with a television channel in Mumbai, reacted to the disruption with dismay. Its very unfair to play with the career of hundreds of students who are just looking to appear for an exam. What was the wrong they committed? Why beat and harass them? It has happened before and I am sure, its going to happen again.

 On May 26, 2003, Shiv Sena activists disrupted a similar examination at the Childrens Academy High School at Malad in suburban Mumbai, claiming that Marathi-speaking people were not being called for the test.

 About 25 activists had entered a classroom and tore question papers. The agitation was organised by the Sthaniya Lokadhikari Samiti, a Sena outfit fighting to safeguard jobs in public sector undertakings for Marathi-speaking people.

 Raj was then part of Bal Thackerays Sena. The latest attack is being seen as an attempt by the younger Thackeray to stake claim to the legacy of the Sena patriarch who had launched a son-of-the-soil campaign, mainly targeting south Indians, in the early sixties.

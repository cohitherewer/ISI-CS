 Probe into Sanjay lawyers tape talk

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sanjay Dutt

 Mumbai, March 17: A sting operation today showed Sanjay Dutts lawyer purportedly questioning the different verdicts handed to the actor and his co-accused in the Bombay blasts case.

 In the footage, shot by news magazine Tehelka and aired by a TV channel, Satish Maneshinde apparently says: People in the chain have been convicted under Tada, but he (Sanjay) has been spared. Even people who didnt know what was in the bag have been convicted under Tada.

 If the Supreme Court (where the actor may appeal his conviction) asks me the person who delivered the weapons, Baba Chauhan, was convicted under Tada, what about him (Sanjay)? I dont have an answer.

 The BJP said the case against Sanjay should be reopened, and deputy chief minister R.R. Patil announced a crime branch inquiry into Maneshindes statements.

 The lawyer said they have selectively aired portions of the tapes, adding that he was planning legal action. 

 Tehelka said it was ready to hand over the tapes for any probe.

 Legal experts said the lawyers comments reflected his personal opinion that would have no impact on the case as he had not criticised the court or the verdict.

 In November, Dutt was cleared of Tada charges and convicted under the Arms Act. The court said the CBI had not proved that the AK-56 seized from him was from the cache used by the blast plotters. 

 Tada charges were dropped also against three of Sanjays friends: Russi Mulla, Kersi Adajania and Yusuf Nulwalla.

 But Baba Chauhan, Samir Hingora and Zaibunissa Kazi, who transported and stored the cache of AK-56 rifles, were convicted under Tada.

 The footage also shows former police officer Y.C. Pawar and former city police chief Mahesh Narain Singh. Pawar purportedly says he was stopped from probing Sanjays involvement further.

 Singh is shown saying the police had phone records that the actor had made seven calls to Dawood Ibrahims brother Anees in Dubai before the rifles were delivered to him. The TV channel alleged that the CBI hadnt argued these points well enough in court.

 Some 69 co-accused had earlier applied to the court seeking parity with Sanjay.

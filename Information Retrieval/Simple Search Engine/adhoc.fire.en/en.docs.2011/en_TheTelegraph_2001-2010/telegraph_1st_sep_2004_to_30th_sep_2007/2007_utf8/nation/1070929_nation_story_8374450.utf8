 New Delhi, Sept. 28: Sanjay Dutt has travelled from Yerwada jail to 7 Race Course Road, in just about a month.

 Accompanied by girlfriend Maanyata, Sanjay today walked into the Prime Ministers residence where Manmohan Singh released Mr and Mrs Dutt: Memories of our Parents, written by the stars sisters Namrata and Priya.

 Sanjay, convicted for illegal possession of arms and out on bail, could easily have passed off as one of the many Congress netas who attended the high-power book launch.

 Among those present were Sonia Gandhi, Shivraj Patil, Sushil Shinde, Ahmed Patel, Mani Shankar Aiyar, Prithviraj Chavan and Murli Deora. Also seen were Meghnad and Kishwar Desai, who Priya said sparked off the idea for the book.

 Like the politicians, Sanjay wore a white kurta, a white salwar and a black jacket.

 From the waiters to the politicos, all vied for his attention. 

 Main Jagdish Tytler hoon, said the Delhi MP, in mock deference to the actor as he was being whisked away. Sanjay stopped to hug him.

 The publishers, who invited Sanjay, and the party knew his presence could lead to uncomfortable questions being thrown at the government.

 We knew it could be a bit of an embarrassment, but how can we let his late parents down? They meant so much to the Congress, a senior minister said.

 Perhaps, all in the Congress also knew Priya and Namrata would not agree to launch the book without Sanjay.

 Each one of them (Priya, Namrata and Sanjay) has tried to live up to the hopes and aspirations of their parents in their own way. I wish each of them a long life of unstinting public service, Singh said.

 Sonia recalled how Sunil Dutt had worn himself out doing sadhbhavna yatras.

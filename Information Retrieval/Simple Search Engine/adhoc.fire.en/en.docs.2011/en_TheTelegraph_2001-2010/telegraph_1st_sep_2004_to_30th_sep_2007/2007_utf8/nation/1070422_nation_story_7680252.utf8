 Secret talks in hills

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Coonoor (Tamil Nadu), April 21: The talks are being touted as top secret but the players, both Indian and Chinese, look cheerful and relaxed.

 Not a bit of the strain of holding the ninth round of India-China border talks shows as national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and Chinese vice-foreign minister Dai Bingguo stroll around the Taj Garden Retreat that nestles prettily amid the misty Blue Mountains.

 No one, not the Intelligence Bureau sleuths or other security personnel, who has converged on this remote hill station in the Nilgiris will tell why the two delegations have picked Coonoor for their talks.

 Most just shrug away the question. Others say talks as top secret as these call for a location as removed as this. These are highly confidential talks and top secret parleys, an official said.

 Whatever the reason, three halls in the Taj Garden Retreat have been booked for the two-day talks that began today. This is the first time the Indian foreign ministry is hosting such an event in Tamil Nadu.

 The retreat, which was taken over by the Taj Group of Hotels in 1991, comprises quaint British-type cottages with tiled roofs. It is tucked away in a pretty corner of a posh residential area in Bedford in the Nilgiris district.

 It is still not known to us in which cottage Mr Narayanan and Mr Dai will be talking, a hotel official said.

 Dai, who is Beijings special representative for the border talks, was in good humour when he arrived after a two-and-a-half-hour drive over bumpy hill roads from Coimbatore to Coonoor.

 Narayanan and some members of his team, which includes ambassador to China Nirupama Rao, landed earlier in a chopper.

 Dai is being assisted by San Yusi, the Chinese ambassador to India.

 The Chinese vice-foreign minister, who had come with plans to mix business and pleasure, could not visit Kotagiri this evening because of heavy rains in the forest there.

 There could be a damper on his plans to go to Botanical Gardens in Ooty tomorrow because a group of Tibetan refugee traders selling woollen accessories has decided to go on strike.

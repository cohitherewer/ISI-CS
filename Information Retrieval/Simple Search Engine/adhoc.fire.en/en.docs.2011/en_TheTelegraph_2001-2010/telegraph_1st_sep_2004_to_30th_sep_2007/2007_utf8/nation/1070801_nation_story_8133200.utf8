 On D-Day, 

the colour Richa loved

 Mumbai, July 31: On judgement day, Sanjay Dutt put aside past habits to choose what his first wife, the mother of his only child, preferred to see him in.

 The movie star wore white, discarding the blue shirt that has almost been his trademark during court appearances.

 Many of his friends thought he should wear the same old shirt. But Sanju seemed to have made up his mind about wearing the colour Richa loved to see him in, an aide said.

 There have been many women in his life, but Richa has always had a special place in his heart.

 Hours earlier, the actor had packed his current girlfriend, Mannyata, off to South Africa to spare her the media glare.

 Richa had died of brain cancer not too long after their marriage. Sanjay is very close to their child Trishala and spoke to her for half an hour before leaving for court.

 As the Honda City rolled into the court, it seemed to drive the media and the assembled thousand-odd onlookers into a frenzy. The car reversed gear immediately and drove off, leaving everyone puzzled.

 Minutes later, it was back. Sanjay stepped out resolutely amid the popping flashbulbs and headed for the walk-through metal detectors, his fans screaming his name from the crowded rooftops and tree branches.

 The actor stumbled, leaned on a policeman for support and came up with a lopsided and awkward smile. He then almost forgot a routine he must have become used to: a body check by security. No, he wasnt carrying a wallet but only some loose cash, which he held up for inspection.

 Once past security, he strode towards the courtroom with hardly a sideways glance.

 Sanju, relax, someone cried.

 Its hard to relax today, he answered to no one in particular and stepped into the courtroom.

 It was past 11pm. The judge hadnt arrived but the silence was palpable. 

 Dutt took his seat in the dock and waited for the other accused his friends Russi Mulla, Yusuf Nullwala and Kersi Adajania who arrived soon. Nods were exchanged and the quartet sat down together on a side bench close to a window, their backs turned to the wall. Nullwala began praying while the rest stared at their hands, tension oozing out of every vein.

 Mulla was called first and when the judge let him off on the probation officers report, Sanjay broke into a smile and patted his friend in the back.

 A buzz went around the courtroom and the reporters allowed in with their mobiles for the first time began text messaging furiously, their fingers tapping out a statement of hope that must have been resonating through Sanjays mind.

 But within seconds, excitement had turned to suspense. The judge announced he was separating Mullas sentencing from that of the others because he felt their offences were of disparate levels.

 Sanjay went red in the face. He stood very still, staring now at the floor, now at the ceiling. He then stepped into the witness box.

 As the actor stood ramrod straight, listening to judge Pramod Kode read out his statement, it was impossible not to be reminded of Munnabhai as he had stood before his college dean in a chapel, confessing his sins.

 Then the tears began streaming down. With every passing moment it was becoming more and more clear that this was not his day. Even a bail extension was not in sight.

 Sanjay pleaded with folded hands for leniency and then walked out with his lawyers, looking every inch the lost, big child many have always seen him to be.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 No to award from looters

 Fernandes: Insulted?

 Aug. 17: Remo Fernandes believes politicians dont rock but only rob, and isnt afraid to say it.

 The singer has refused a Goa government award in protest against the loot of the state by its ministers, Opposition leaders and other politicians.

 Over a decade ago, the rock star had sung Politicians dont know to rock roll, but his snub to the government today wasnt prompted by doubts about its knowledge of music.

 I refuse this state award or reward as a sign of protest against the government of Goa as well as the Opposition, both full of ministers and politicians involved in large-scale attempted rape and sale of Goa, Remo wrote to the art and culture department.

 The Goan singer, whose lyrics have often poured scorn on politicians, made it clear that his current salvo was restricted to those in his state.

 His letter mentioned the Padma Shri he had gratefully accepted from the Centre last January, and saluted the non-politician President with the rock-star locks who had handed it to him.

 I had the privilege of receiving the Padma Shri from the hands of then President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, one of the most honest, upright, wise, qualified and dignified gentlemen in India, Remo said.

 Now, receiving an award from the government of Goa... would be an insult to Mr Kalam, to the Padma Shri award, as well as to me.

 Remo has often triggered controversy by appearing to mock politicians. In 1986, he sang Hello Rajiv Gandhi at an official function for visiting Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. 

 Little good boy have a duty towards their mothers, he crooned, before advising Rajiv to come to Goa every month so the government would complete a stalled project.

 The same year, Remo sang Mr Minister, a satire on those who get elected and forget their promises.

 The singer, however, has also questioned the logic of choosing him for the award, which was to be given tomorrow. The Goa government does not recognise achievements of a person at the state level and then rewards the person after he or she receives an honour at the national level. 

 Remo has asked the government to donate the Rs 50,000 cash component of the award to an NGO, Goa Bachao Andolan.

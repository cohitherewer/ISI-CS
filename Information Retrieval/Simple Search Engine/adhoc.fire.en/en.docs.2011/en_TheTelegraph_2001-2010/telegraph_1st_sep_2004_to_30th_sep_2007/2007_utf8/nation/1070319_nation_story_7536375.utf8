 Explosives at Tata site

 Chinsurah, March 18: The recovery of six explosives from the Tata Motors small car project site in Singurs Gopalnagar-Bosepukur area today created a flutter, reports our correspondent.

 Police and bomb experts were called in after one of the explosives went off around 3.30 this morning, leaving a hole in the boundary wall of the project site.

 The area has been cordoned off and a manhunt is on to identify who could have left the explosives there. Some officers said outsiders could have planted them. 

 Experts from the bomb squad collected the explosives from a hole and later defused them.

 Anuj Sharma, DIG, Burdwan range, said the explosives appear to be IEDs, but we are getting expert opinion.

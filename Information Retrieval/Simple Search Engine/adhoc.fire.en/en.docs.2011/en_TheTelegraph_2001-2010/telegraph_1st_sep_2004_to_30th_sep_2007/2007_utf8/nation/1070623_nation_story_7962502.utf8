 Push for Dawood

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 22: India will press for Dawood Ibrahims deportation from Pakistan and voice concern over infiltration in Kashmir when home secretaries of the two countries meet next month.

 As security officials finalised the agenda for the July 3 talks in New Delhi, the consensus was the Dawood issue should not be allowed to die down.

 Pakistan has always denied his presence on its soil.

 Delhi will also push for the deportation of other fugitives. A list of 38 criminals was handed over during the last round of talks in Islamabad, but Pakistan has been silent.

 Cross-border terror will top the agenda for the talks. Home secretary Madhukar Gupta will visit the Valley next week to review the security situation and prepare documents for next months discussions.

 Blind-faith stampede kills 11 at quacks ashram

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Jabalpur, Sept. 6: Eleven devotees waiting to meet a quack known for his miracle eye cures were today killed in a stampede at his ashram, 35km from Jabalpur. 

 The rush, that left hundreds injured, occurred when a downpour forced many of the 20,000 devotees to scurry into a narrow path leading to the ashram of Sarota Baba, famed for his cataract removals and bloodless surgeries. The baba is so called because he uses a sarota, the pincer-like tool used to cut betel nuts.

 State health minister Ajay Vishnoi, who hails from Jabalpur, gave the quack a clean chit even as he ordered a magisterial probe. 

 Collector Sanjay Dubey said lack of proper arrangements sparked the rush. Vishnoi announced a relief of Rs 50,000 each for relatives of the victims. 

 Tragedies involving devotees arent rare in Madhya Pradesh. In April 2005, over hundred people were washed away when a dam suddenly released water in Dewas. Last October, at least 40 devotees drowned because of the same reason in Seondha, 250km from Bhopal.

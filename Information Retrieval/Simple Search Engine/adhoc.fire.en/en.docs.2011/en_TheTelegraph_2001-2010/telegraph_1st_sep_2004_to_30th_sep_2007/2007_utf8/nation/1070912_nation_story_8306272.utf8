 Death in sky, dive into sea

 Sept. 11: Tragedy and an embarrassment have struck the Indian defence establishment basking in the afterglow of the path-breaking war games.

 An Indian Air Force training aircraft crashed near Hyderabad today, killing a trainee pilot and the instructor.

 The accident coincided with a revelation that the Indian Navys aircraft carrier, INS Viraat, survived a scare after one of its onboard Sea Harriers plunged into the water on the last day of the five-nation Malabar war games in the Bay of Bengal. 

 Squadron Leader Bhagat, 33, and trainee pilot U.C. Pathi, 26, were killed after their Kiran Mark I aircraft turned into a ball of fire about 10 minutes after take-off from the runway of the Air Force Academy at 3am today, an official source said. The bodies were unrecognisable. 

 The crash of the Sea Harrier aircraft occurred during the day on Sunday. A navy source said Lieutenant Commander A. Jains aircraft was being recovered about to land after a sortie with US aircraft during a drill on the last day of the war games. 

 Lt Commander A. Jain felt a loss of power in the aircraft even as he was poised for landing.

 He managed to veer away from above the flight deck of the Viraat and ejected as the aircraft plunged into the sea. The ejection seats in the Sea Harriers allow pilots to bail out at the last minute. Jain was picked up by a rescue helicopter in minutes. 

 The incident is an embarrassment for the Indian Navy because it happened in the presence of contingents from the navies of Japan, Australia, Singapore and the US.

 Earlier this year, a Sea Harrier twin-seater had crashed off Goa, killing one pilot but the other ejected in time. 

 The Sea Harriers are Indias only onboard combat aircraft of the navy. They were first acquired in 1983.

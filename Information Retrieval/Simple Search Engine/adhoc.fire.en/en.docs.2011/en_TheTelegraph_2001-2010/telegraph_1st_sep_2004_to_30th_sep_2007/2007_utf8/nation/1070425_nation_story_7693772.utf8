 Push to nuke deal before US poll brake

 OUR BUREAU

 Menon, Burns: Running against

 time 

 New Delhi, April 24: Key negotiations will be held on May 1 to finalise the Indo-US nuclear deal when foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon meets US under-secretary for political affairs Nicholas Burns in Washington.

 Delhis envoy to Singapore, S. Jaishankar, will be joining Menons delegation. The inclusion of Jaishankar, who has led the Indian side in the talks so far, indicates the seriousness of the meeting.

 India would like to retain the right to test nuclear weapons, but the problem is that under US law, any country that does so loses the right to any further nuclear cooperation.

 It now seems that both sides might simply sidestep any direct mention of Indias desire to keep its moratorium unilateral as well as the consequences that could follow. Such omission would allow both administrations to save face with their own hawks.

 The so-called hardline Indian position on testing could be a bargaining position, too, even if its an extreme one.

 A section of the Indian establishment feels that having gone so far with India on nuclear cooperation, the Bush administration could soften if Delhi now offers minor compromises.

 And, if minor compromises with the US end up in major gains for India, it would make Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appear a strong leader.

 Delhi realises that it must finalise the deal over the next few weeks. Soon, the Bush administration will go into election campaign mode and interest in India will flag.

 The key is to put just enough pressure on Washington so that it is able to still ignore its own non-proliferationists.

 Failure is not an option, a government source said, adding that the nuclear deal has so far been the only major achievement of the United Progressive Alliance government in foreign affairs.

 The inability to settle the issues with Pakistan or the border problem with China has increased the pressure to arrive at a compromise with the US on the nuclear deal.

 Menon is actually going to Washington to participate in a Global Issues forum with his counterpart, Paula Dobriansky, on April 30.

 Export rap

 A US jury has found a Pennsylvania-based company guilty of illegally exporting defence items to India in 2003-04, an AP report said.

 Electro-Glass Products was charged with sending 23,000 solder glass preforms, components of military night-vision equipment, to Pune-based Be-Delft Electronics, a join venture of state-owned Bharat Electronics and Delft Instruments of the Netherlands.

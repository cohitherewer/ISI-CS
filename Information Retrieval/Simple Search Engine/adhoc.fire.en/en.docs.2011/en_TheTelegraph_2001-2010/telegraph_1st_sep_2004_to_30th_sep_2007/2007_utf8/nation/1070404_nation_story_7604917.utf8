 Ship hijack

 Nairobi, April 3 (AFP): Pirates have hijacked an Indian cargo ship anchored at Somalias main port Mogadishu and taken it northwards up the coast, a maritime official said today.

 The hijackers took control of MV Nimatullah and its 14 crew members on Sunday. The official said the identity of the pirates remained unknown, but that they had demanded an unspecified ransom.

 The ship was ferrying 800 tonnes of household goods.

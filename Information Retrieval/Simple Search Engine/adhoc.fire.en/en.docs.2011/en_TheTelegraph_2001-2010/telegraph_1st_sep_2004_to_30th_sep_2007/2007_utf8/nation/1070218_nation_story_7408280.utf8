 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Little brains with big ideas

Deborah Hakewan has developed an electronic traffic simulator to help students brush up their road rules. And she is all of 10.

 The girl from Nigeria is among a bunch of children whose innovations are drawing gasps of admiration from visitors at the Indian Engineering and Technology Fair in the capital. 

 It isnt just a teaching tool though, the soft-spoken Deborah explained. I have incorporated technology whereby the traffic lights turn green out of turn for emergency vehicles ambulances, police vans and fire engines. 

 Next to the 10-year-old, her mates from Nigeria and new-found friends from Sri Lanka are busy in their stalls. Their seemingly simple inventions like a bucket that has a valve to prevent water from overflowing are vying with fancy cars for attention.

 Marketing their products and applying for patents in a poor country like Nigeria isnt easy, said Sunday Jeshurun, Deborahs teacher. 

 The children have help though the World Intellectual Property Organisation is organising training programmes at the fair to educate and assist them in preserving their intellectual property.

 Wiser after idiot marathon

Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy had to pay a heavy price for calling N. Chandrababu Naidu an idiot in the Assembly. The repartee from the Opposition leader was, hold your breath, three and half hours long.

 The former roommates the chief minister and Naidu graduated from the Sri Venkateswara University in Tirupati are always at loggerheads both in and out of the House.

 A recent debate on a motion of thanks on the governors address turned particularly ugly, with Naidu accusing Reddy of a hand in a teachers scandal in his native Kadapa district. 

 Neeku a paparla ku buddi ledu (both you and the newspapers that reported it are idiots), a fuming YSR replied on the floor of the House. 

 A pandemonium followed. Things calmed down only when the chief minister withdrew his comment. 

 To appease Naidu, Speaker K.R. Suresh Reddy allowed him to speak till he was tired. And the Telugu Desam Party boss ensured the 210-minute marathon left not only him, but his audience tired as well.

 Cooking up a Cauvery curry

Dont be surprised if a boiling sambar pot stands in your way. And please dont be startled if you have to slam the brakes for a camel train to pass. 

 Kannadigas are furious at being told to release more Cauvery water for Tamil Nadu and are putting their own people in trouble to give vent to their anger. 

 MLA Vatal Nagaraj rode a buffalo to the Vidhana Soudha to make his point. There are women with empty pots and men with drums making themselves heard here and there. For 11 days, a group of families cooked their meal on the Bangalore-Mysore highway, had it and dispersed. 

 blood donation camp was held in the heart of the city. The organisers said the blood would be sent to Chennai. The reason: We would rather give away our blood than water.

 Smile at 6 sharp

The Mexican Wave may have been waved a goodbye, but another kind of wave is waiting to sweep Mumbai. 

 If the Brahma Kumaris has its way, the city will smile in unison on March 4 at 6 pm sharp.

 The Smile-a-Moment campaign launched on Friday at Shanti Udyan in Sion aims to spread peace. 

 It will culminate on March 4, when people from all over Mumbai will be asked to smile at 6 pm. 

 The purpose is to create a smile wave that spreads all across Mumbai. Everyone can participate by filling in a letter indicating their positive intent of how many smile-a-moments they will donate in a day, said Sudha Murthy, an official of the Brahma Kumaris, which describes itself as a spiritual organisation.

Bangalore: Latin hip-hop group Ozomatli will perform at Ambedkar Bhavan on February 19. The Grammy winners will take the stage at 7.30 pm.

 Passes are available at World Space Lounge, Forum Mall, American Center (Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan building) and at The Opus.

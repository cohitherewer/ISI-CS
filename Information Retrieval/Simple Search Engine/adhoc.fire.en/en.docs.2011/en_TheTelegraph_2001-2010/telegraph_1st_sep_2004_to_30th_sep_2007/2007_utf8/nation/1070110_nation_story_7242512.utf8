 Chartered financial analyst mark off

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jan. 9: The Association for Investment Management and Research (AIMR), now called CFA Institute of Charlottesville, Virginia, US, has been refused registration of the collective trademark chartered financial analyst in class 36 in the UK.

 This order was passed on the basis of a recent application filed by the Chartered Insurance Institute of the UK opposing registration by AIMR of the chartered financial analyst mark. 

 The trademark authority in the UK has disallowed AIMR the use of the term. 

 The crux of the Chartered Insurance Institutes representation was that the use of the word charter might mislead the public into believing that the mark was approved or regulated by a professional body established by the Royal Charter. 

 Under international classification of goods and services for trademarks, class 36 is applicable to services in insurance, financial and real estate affairs, among others. The class does not include services such as accountancy which is class 35. 

 The decision of the trademark authority in the UK bars members of AIMR to use the designation chartered financial analyst in the UK. 

 A collective trademark is indicative of membership of an organisation which is involved in offering services in the corresponding class.

 Trademark applications of AIMR under class 36 to use the words chartered financial analyst are still pending in several other countries, including Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong and India.

 A student who has applied for the AIMR diploma said the recent development has led to confusion among them as they do not know what would be their status in the light of the recent reports on the decision of the trademark authority of the UK. 

 We do not know what is the status of the diploma at present, said Anirban Raychoudhury, a student.

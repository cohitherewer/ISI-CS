 Bengal hunt for formula

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 20: Bengal CPM leaders are trying to work out a face-saving compromise on the nuclear standoff, party sources said today.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was in touch with the governments crisis manager, Pranab Mukherjee, as well as CPM chief Prakash Karat and politburo member Sitaram Yechury through the day, they said.

 At todays Left Front meeting in Delhi, the CPMs allies are believed to have climbed down from their demand for immediate withdrawal of support.

 A leader who attended the discussions said the allies had suggested giving the government time till the second week of September, when the International Atomic Energy Agencys board of governors meet in Vienna. Delhi has to get its negotiations into gear by then for an India-specific safeguards regime if it is serious about operationalising the nuclear deal.

 CPM veteran Jyoti Basu declined to comment on the possibility of withdrawal of support, but iterated that the party should not be in a hurry to decide on a divorce.

 It is a serious issue. I cant comment before the central committee decides, he said.

 But asked about the possibility of a mid-term poll, he said the question does not arise now, explaining that the government would not be facing a trial of strength in the House anytime soon.

 The Parliament debate on the nuclear deal would not entail voting, Basu said. The Lok Sabha Speaker has already made it clear.

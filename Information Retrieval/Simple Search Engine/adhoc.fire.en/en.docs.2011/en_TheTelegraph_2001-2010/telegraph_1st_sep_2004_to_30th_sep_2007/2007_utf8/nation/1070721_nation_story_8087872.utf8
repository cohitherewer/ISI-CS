 Missing mentors letter found

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, July 20: The mystery behind the disappearance of Baba Ramdevs mentor has deepened with the recovery of a letter whose authenticity appears suspect.

 The note, written by Mahant Shankerdev and being examined by handwriting experts, suggests two possible reasons for him going away.

 In the letter, Shankerdev speaks about his unbearable pain from chronic lung and spinal tuberculosis. But he does not say how leaving the ashram would make him feel better or if he has gone to an undisclosed place for treatment.

 The suspense has increased with a mention about loans that Shankerdev says he has to repay to some of the ashrams inmates. But one person he has named died 40 years ago.

 Shankerdev has begged pardon from Yashdev Shastri, Bali Ram, Hari Dass, Chakor Dass, Nirwanji, all inmates, for not returning the money he had taken from them as loan, said Hardwar superintendent of police Ajay Joshi, who is heading the probe.

 But what has puzzled the police, which stumbled on the letter during a search of Shankerdevs room last evening, is the reference to Ram, the sadhu who is dead.

 The question nagging investigators and inmates alike is: Did Shankerdev not know that Ram is not alive? Most of them at the ashram feel it is highly unlikely.

 Shastri, another sadhu named in the letter, is with Ramdev on his overseas trip that has now taken him to the UK. 

 We have doubts about the authenticity of the letter. That is why we have sought expert opinion on it, Joshi said.

 Ashram chief and Ramdevs trusted associate Acharya Balkrishna confirmed that Shankerdev had been suffering from chronic problems in his lungs and spine.

 But he was surprised at the mention of unpaid loans, saying Shankerdev was himself one of the signing authorities for clearing cheques on behalf of the ashram. It is unlikely that he would not be able to repay the money. 

 How can the guru of one of the richest yoga gurus (Ramdev) suffer from this kind of financial crisis? another inmate at the ashram wondered.

 We have intimated all branches of the ashram about Shankerdev. Ramdev, too, has expressed concern over his gurus disappearance under such mysterious circumstances, said Balkrishna.

 Ramdev is believed to have called up Uttarakhand chief minister B.C. Khanduri, expressing anguish over the disappearance of his guru and requesting a quick probe.

 21 foetuses found

 Bangalore, Aug. 5: Ragpickers found 21 foetuses wrapped in plastic when they opened two bags of bio-medical waste this evening, reports our special correspondent.

 The bags had been dropped in a gutter around 4km from MG Road, the city centre.

 Police initially refused to reveal that the bags contained foetuses, but were forced to admit it after state womens commission chairperson Premila Nesargi intervened.

 The foetuses, each wrapped separately, were stuffed in two bags containing used cotton and syringes. They have been taken to the government-run Victoria Hospital for sex determination tests.

 The incident comes soon after an illegal abortion racket was busted in Orissa last week.

 Initial investigation has brought a nursing home in Kundapur, near Mangalore, under suspicion. A receipt mentioning its address was found in one of the bags.

 The police said the bags were dumped by a travel agency van, which operates daily between Bangalore and Kundapur, and the ragpickers immediately set about opening them. 

 The police suspect the bags were loaded on to the van at the nursing home.

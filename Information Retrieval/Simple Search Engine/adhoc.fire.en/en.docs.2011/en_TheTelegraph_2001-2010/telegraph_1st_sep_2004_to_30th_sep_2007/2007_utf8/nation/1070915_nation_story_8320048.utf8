 Ram rajya vs temple

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The Congress, forced to bow to Ram in the Sethusamudram controversy, may try to draw a distinction between Ram rajya and a Ram temple.

 Party strategists have drawn up several tentative arguments and slogans that will be fine-tuned and used if the BJPs campaign gets shriller.

 For instance, the Congress will challenge the BJP to demand scrapping of the navigation project. They wont dare do that Jayalalithaa will chew them up, a source said.

 Well also turn the BJPs slogan of mandir waheen banayenge (well build the temple right there) on its head, a general secretary said. Well say the Sangh parivar has sworn never to build a temple anywhere in the country, so they are offering the Ram setu as a consolation prize.

 The Congress will say it stands for Ram rajya (ideal government) rather than a temple, another source said.

 But true to its grain, the Congress will be reactive rather than pro-active because its leaders feel the BJPs offensive has been partly blunted by the governments swift action in withdrawing the affidavit.

 Spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi today dismissed the BJPs demand for an apology from the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi.

 They did not file the affidavits. But they should be congratulated for acting so fast when they recognised that the offending paragraph was an erroneous reflection of a stand (on Ram), he said.

 Asked to clarify the partys stand on Rams historicity, Singhvi hid behind a legalistic stand: The issue of Ram, his authenticity, existence or otherwise, is not relevant to the court proceedings. It is completely foreign to the issue.

 Sources said the Congress was keen to avoid the Ram trap, because this will take us down the slippery slope of answering related questions on whether Ayodhya was his birthplace and why a temple should not be built there.

 Ram is a matter of individual faith, Singhvi said.

 Beggar bequeaths Rs 1 lakh in coins 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, March 9: Pity Ismail Khan didnt live to see this, but the Muzaffarnagar mendicant might have liked to know that hed given many a tycoon a run for his money.

 The 65-year-old died donating over Rs 1 lakh in coins hed collected as a beggar to a trust. 

 Reports of his death came on a day the Forbes list of the worlds richest appeared to lack space to accommodate Indias swelling coven of billionaires.

 He was a true dervish but it is sad that we could discover this after his death, Maulana Rafiq Ahmed, imam of the Khatauni mosque near Muzaffarnagar, a town made infamous by Imranas fight against a rapist father-in-law and the diktats of an orthodox band of clerics.

 Strictly speaking, Ismail was no beggar: three bighas of land and a tiled house with brick walls didnt make him one. But he chose not to live off the plot hed inherited, singing Sufi songs under the shade of a patchy umbrella hed received as a gift from generous souls.

 A spot near the Khatauli mosque, 20 km from Muzaffarnagar, had been his home since the 1980s, when hed arrived after working 20 years for an imam in Meerut.

 As the doors to his house were opened, few would have imagined that Ismail chacha, as he was fondly called, would leave behind a treasure trove. The coins, his lifes big savings, had been kept in a sack and inside a box. Apparently, hed kept his modest properties a secret.

 We have found thousands of coins worth at least a lakh, some new clothes and two gold ornaments, said Imtiaz Ahmed, a member of the trust that will get the money. He could have enjoyed whatever he had inherited but he did not do it, said teacher Moinuddin Rahman. 

 Locals said Ismail, believed to be suffering from amnesia, had been fighting lung congestion and high fever over the past week. He was found dead early Thursday.

 Ismails grave near the mosque is heaped with flowers and other offerings. This (his life) is a modern miracle, muttered Imtiaz, too moved to say anything more. 

 Away from the farewell in Khatauli, another India was getting ready to take the baton from Japan for being home to the largest number of individual billionaires. 

 A record 36 desi tycoons, including 14 newcomers, have made the cut in 2007. It hardly matters that Ismail isnt one of them. Hes too big for Forbes.

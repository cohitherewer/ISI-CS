 Sanjay: Hearing blow

 Aug. 9: No Friday freedom for Munnabhai.

 Locked up in jail for the past nine days, Sanjay Dutt will have to wait longer to know if he can walk free on bail after the Supreme Court today said it would not take up his plea tomorrow.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan made it clear that the court had only listed the matter to be mentioned on Friday, when a date would be formally fixed for hearing the stars plea.

 The clarification came after senior counsel Fali S. Nariman, who appeared for the actor, complained that the matter had not been listed for hearing tomorrow despite the courts directive.

 The test of patience for Sanjay, sentenced to six years in jail in the Bombay blasts case, came on a day another bench, headed by Justice B.N. Aggrawal, said the apex court would not discriminate while dealing with those convicted in the case.

 The assertion came after a lawyer, Mustaq Ahmed, said Sanjay cannot be given any special treatment while hearing other bail applications.

 Fodder for Cong to fire at Pawar

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Pawar

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: Sharad Pawar has become a bone in the Congresss throat that it can neither swallow nor spit out.

 As the UPA government supposedly went into a fire-fighting mode against inflation, Congressmen asked what good would the Prime Ministers intentions yield unless Pawar listened and cooperated with him.

 Even the stray well-wishers the Union agriculture minister and Nationalist Congress Party president had in the Congress felt that Pawar would not do this and were no longer prepared to defend him privately, that is.

 The provocation for the latest round of anti-Pawarism is the spurt in food prices, coupled with the sorry state of the alliance in Maharashtra.

 The Congress feels that Pawar refused to heed the suggestions of Manmohan Singh and P. Chidambaram to build a buffer stock of wheat through imports in 2006 and calibrate onion prices after last years bumper crop.

 But analysts said it is unfair to blame Pawar for the rise in food prices. Several complex factors such as the tussle between the rice and wheat lobbies and aggressive wheat purchase by private players played a key role in pushing up prices, they said.

 But in politics, perception matters more than statistics, and the Congress is making the most of it.

 Now the chicks have come home to roost. Unfortunately for us, its not Pawar who will get the flak but the Congress because it heads the central coalition, said a Congress office-bearer.

 The finance minister reportedly expressed his annoyance, though in a guarded manner, at Thursdays cabinet meeting by saying that the foodgrain crisis had caused prices to escalate. 

 The agriculture minister was unmoved, according to sources.

 Congress sources insinuated that Pawar deliberately looked the other way on prices because he wanted to help his farmers in Maharashtra (it remains a major onion producer) and fix their party politically.

 The Congresss problem was while the Prime Minister reportedly had a good working relationship with Pawar, party chief and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi did not have one. So when something seriously political has to be discussed with him or the NCP, its done by Ahmed Patel or Priya Ranjan Das Munshi (an old friend of Pawar), said a source.

 Sonia deals directly with the leaders of the other UPA allies such as Lalu Prasad, M. Karunanidhi, Ram Vilas Paswan and even the Left, if the need arises. But Pawar is a no-no. 

 The absence of a Sonia-Pawar hotline meant the others, including Singh, did not have the degree of authority needed to handle him when a crisis arose and, therefore, he pretty much did what he wished to.

 Kafeels dream

 New Delhi, July 16 (PTI): Kafeel Ahmed, the key accused in the failed UK terror plot, had dreamt of constructing a housing complex on the outskirts of Bangalore where the Shariat would prevail.

 An analysis of his computer hard disk showed a detailed project, officials carrying out his background check said. Kafeel, who drove a blazing jeep into Glasgow airport, wanted to buy five acres in or around Bangalore for the complex, they added.

 An engineer by profession, Kafeel had been visiting several religious and secessionist websites, including that of the Jamat-ul Dawa, the parent organisation of the Lashkar-e-Toiba. He had also been attending religious meetings and opposed the modernisation of Islam, sources said.

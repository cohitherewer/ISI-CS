The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Calcutta for IT, Bangalore for MNC

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 1: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will be glad. Twice as many young Calcuttans want an IT job than those who dream of being on the rolls of a foreign multinational.

 Bangalores political guardians, though, should be worried. Their youth prefer MNCs to software by two to one, and yearn to flee abroad, whether to study or work.

 The Mumbaikar, hooked to Bollywood and the metropoliss glamorous nightlife, loves his city the maximum.

 A survey of the youth in five cities by The Telegraph has thrown up a mix of the expected and the surprising.

 The Calcuttan is not a go-getter, caring only moderately for money, which he would spend on his family. But only after squirreling a portion away an old-fashioned idea that Chennai scoffs at.

 The Mumbaikar would rather spend his money to get some fun for himself. The Delhiite cares the most for cash and is the least tolerant of meddlesome parents he is the Calcuttans opposite.

 The Calcutta youth is happiest curled up with a book or listening to music, after a home-cooked meal, and his longing to be seen as knowledgeable does College Street and Coffee House proud. The Delhi dashers idea of a good evening, however, is eating out and watching a movie.

 And while the Calcuttan is careless about his dress, the Delhiite would give an arm and more to be noticed for his looks and clothes. But unlike the brand-savvy Mumbaikar or Chennaiite, any outfit will do for him so long as its showy enough.

 If opposites attract, Calcuttans should be falling for Delhiites. But the Bangalorean may be worth a look she is the most spiritual and keen to serve others. 

 Whoever he chooses, the Calcuttan must make the first move. He alone is romantic enough to vote for the love marriage all the rest would leave it to their parents.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Diplomat for all seasons 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: Considered one of Indias ablest diplomats, Ronen Sen has handled some of the most sensitive national assignments in his nearly 40-year-old career.

 He has been ambassador to Russia, Germany and London and has served in the atomic energy department. As joint secretary in Rajiv Gandhis PMO, he was among the young Prime Ministers closest aides. 

 Ironically, it was Atal Bihari Vajpayees government which appointed him ambassador to the US in April 2004. Today, BJP leader Sushma Swaraj demanded that Sen be summoned to the parliamentary bar and made to apologise. 

 When the NDA lost power in the elections that followed a month later in May 2004, Sens political appointment was approved by the new government a testimony to his wide circle of friends cutting across political circles. 

 He has been a key mover behind the nuclear deal, travelling to Delhi every other month to speak to both Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh.

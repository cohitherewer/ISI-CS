 Army trial in test-fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 23: A new regiment of the Indian Army that is being specially raised test-fired the BrahMos cruise missile in Orissa yesterday, confirming that the artillery wing is being restructured and expanded.

 When the Indian Army begins inducting the BrahMos cruise missile likely from August the missile group of its artillery wing will be its custodian. 

 With defence scientists who have designed the BrahMos missile supervising the launch and asking the army to carry it out, it was an opportunity for the nucleus of the new army formation the missile group to test itself

 This is the third missile group that the army is raising. The first two the 333 and the 444 were raised for the Prithvi and the Agni II missiles. The BrahMos is a different class of missile cruise, not ballistic and calls for a special set of skills from the regiment that will be responsible for it.

 This was the third of 14 tests of the missile that is for the army. 

 The BrahMos was originally intended as an anti-ship cruise missile and most of the tests have been for the navy.

 The missile groups would report to the army headquarters directly but would also be expected to act in co-ordination with the Strategic Forces Command, a tri-services command.

 The BrahMos would be able to carry a 300-kg payload and deliver a nuclear warhead.

 The BrahMos variant for the army is being made capable of being launched from a Tatra truck as well as from a railway flatbed wagon. 

 The missile with a range of 290 km is touted by its manufacturer, the India-Russia joint venture company (also named BrahMos), as better than the US Tomahawk. The Tomahawk is subsonic and the BrahMos supersonic.

 Yesterdays test was overseen by the officers who are raising the army regiment Lt General B.S. Pawar, a commandant at the School of Artillery, Deolali, and Major General V.K. Chaturvedi, additional director general (artillery).

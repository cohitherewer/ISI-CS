 Shibu Soren

 New Delhi/Ranchi, March 14: Former Union minister and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader Shibu Soren was refused bail by Delhi High Court today, throwing his membership of Parliament at stake due to continued absence from the House. 

 A division bench of Justices Manmohan Sarin and S.L. Bhayana, dismissing Sorens plea for suspension of his life sentence in the murder case of his private secretary Shashinath Jha, observed: It cannot be said at this stage that the case is bereft of any evidence implicating the appellant. 

 There are no special circumstances warranting suspension of the sentence. The bench added: While human liberty is sacrosanct, we cannot overlook the fact that the appellant has been convicted after a detailed and elaborate trial. 

 JMM MP Sudam Marandi said the party was aware that if the prescribed time limit for absence lapsed, Soren could lose his membership of Parliament. JMM leaders in Delhi and Jharkhand are in touch with each other and will soon meet to decide how the party will act in the eventuality, he added.

 A Delhi trial court on December 5, 2006, had sentenced Soren and four others to life in jail for Jhas abduction and murder. After resigning as a minister and his subsequent arrest, Soren has been unable to attend Parliament.

 The high court, which fixed April 5 for final orders, directed the CBI, a prosecuting agency in this case, to prepare documents within 15 days.

 The CBI had opposed Sorens bail plea and suspension of sentence on the ground that he had masterminded the abduction and murder conspiracy.

 Soren was apparently shocked when party leaders broke the news to him at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences where he is undergoing treatment.

 But he remained stoic, the leaders added. Nothing to worry about. Keep doing the party work diligently to strengthen the organisation, Soren murmured.

 Party sources said Soren had skipped lunch and was tense from the morning, apparently hoping for a favourable verdict.

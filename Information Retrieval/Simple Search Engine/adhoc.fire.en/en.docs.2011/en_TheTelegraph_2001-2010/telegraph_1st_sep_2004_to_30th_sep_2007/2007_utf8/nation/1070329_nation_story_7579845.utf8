 New Delhi, March 28 (PTI): Hardening its stand against advertisers clamouring for a revision in contracts after Indias World Cup debacle, Sony Entertainment Television today said it will not review deals already agreed.

 There is no question of any renegotiation. We have signed contracts for the long term. These are not terminable and there is no scope for negotiations, Sony executive vice-president (revenues) Rohit Gupta said.

 Calling the demand for a revision in rates prompted by an dramatic drop in viewership unfair, Gupta said the reported meeting between officials of the channel and advertisers wasnt for renegotiation of sealed contracts. 

 We dont control Team Indias fortunes or luck, so advertisers cannot ask us to reduce rate after the teams exit. If India had reached the finals, we wouldnt have asked them to pay double the rates, he said.

 His comments come in the backdrop of hopes among some advertisers that the channel would consider their demand for a rate revision following a drop in viewership.

 From the advertisers point of view, both parties acknowledge there has been value erosion after Indias exit. They (Sony) have to help advertisers overcome problem, said Sundar Raman, managing director of Mindshare, whose clients such as PepsiCo and Motorola have booked airtime on Sony for the World Cup.

 According to industry estimates, a 10-second ad slot is priced at Rs 1.5 lakh. Sony has raked in around Rs 350 crore from deals during the tournament, but industry watchers say it could have earned Rs 150 crore more by hawking last-minute slots if India had reached Super Eight. 

 Sponsor pangs

 Key sponsors of ICC tournaments are taking a fresh look at whether they should continue their association with cricket. LG has already hinted it might not renew its deal with the top cricket body after the World Cup. Other big players, like Hero Honda and PepsiCo, are expected to make up their minds over the next few weeks.

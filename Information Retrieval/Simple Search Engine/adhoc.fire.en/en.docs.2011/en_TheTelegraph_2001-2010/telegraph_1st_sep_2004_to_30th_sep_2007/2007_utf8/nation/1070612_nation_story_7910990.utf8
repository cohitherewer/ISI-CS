 New Delhi, June 11 (PTI): Deepak Gupta will not need any more drinks breaks. A sessions court today stayed a magistrates order asking him to help control traffic.

 On Sunday, Deepak had begun serving out the sentence in Delhis searing heat with two policemen. The summer job was punctuated by drinks breaks for water. The 19-year-old had pleaded guilty to drunken driving.

 Additional sessions judge S.N. Gupta stayed the punishment given to Deepak after Delhi police filed a revision petition in which they argued that the trial courts order was illegal and beyond the provisions of the law. 

 The police said there were no provisions for community services asking Deepak to help traffic police is part of it in law. Section 279 of the IPC provides a term of six months or a fine of Rs 1,000 or both. The trial courts fine of Rs 3,000 is also in excess of what is set out in the legal provisions, the petition, filed by the officer-in-charge of Mayapuri police station, says.

 A sentence that requires a person to help manage traffic is illegal and beyond the provisions of law since the job needs special training, the officer said in the petition. The next hearing in the case has been slated for July 10. 

 Deepak, who pleaded guilty to rash driving last Tuesday, was ordered by metropolitan magistrate Gautam Manan to help man the traffic at the busy Kalkaji intersection away from his Sangam Vihar home from 10 am to 1.30 pm daily for 10 days. He was also fined Rs 3,000. 

 The incident dates back to February 16, when a patrol team in Mayapuri received a call saying a Hyundai Santro had turned turtle. Deepak, trapped inside the car, was rescued but was found drunk. 

 The order, akin to a community service, given to Deepak is rare in India, but is common in the West. Socialite and hotel heiress Paris Hilton is now in jail for drunken driving.

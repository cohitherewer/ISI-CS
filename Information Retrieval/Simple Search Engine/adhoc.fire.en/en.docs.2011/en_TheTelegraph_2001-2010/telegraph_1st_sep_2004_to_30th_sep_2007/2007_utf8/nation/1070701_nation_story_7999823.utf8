 Stunned son wants to see body first

 OUR BUREAU 

New Delhi, June 30: When the news flashed on a television channel, twenty-five-year-old Pravin Rams body stiffened.

 The body of his father, Food Corporation of India (FCI)s executive director P.C. Ram abducted over two months ago by the Ulfa had just been found in Assams Baksa district, the channel said. 

 Then he looked at his mother and sister, watching the television with him, stunned. 

 The MBA student at Ghaziabads Institute of Management Technology was up the next minute, making arrangements to visit Guwahati. 

 Pravin and a cousin will be leaving for Guwahati early tomorrow, where, they have been told, Rams body will be brought. 

 Till then, Pravin says, he is unwilling to accept that his father is dead. You tell me, where is the confirmation yet, he says, his voice surprisingly steady. 

 His elder sister Neerja doesnt want to talk nor does Rams wife Padmavati Devi. 

 Ram and his driver Rabiram Basumatary were abducted on April 17 by Ulfa militants from the Ulubari area of Guwahati while returning home in Rams official vehicle. 

 The next day Pravin received a call from the militants demanding a ransom of Rs 21 crore.

 Later, Basumatary was released and the militants changed their demand two of their comrades, lodged in jails, would have to be set free for Ram to be let off. 

 Rams colleagues at FCI said they were particularly upset with the inability of security forces over the past two months. 

 We are all terribly pained and shocked. But let me say this... no matter what the terrorists do, our supply to the Northeast will not be affected. That is our commitment, FCI managing director Alok Sinha said.

 The north-eastern states have traditionally been dependent on the FCI for their grain supply. 

 FCI will soon decide on compensation for Rams family, Sinha said.

 Minority hurt seeps out on delayed action

 NISHIT DHOLABHAI 

 New Delhi, Aug. 13: The Maharashtra governments move to implement the recommendations of the Srikrishna commission may have come a shade too late. 

 As the law takes its course in Mumbai and Coimbatore, ravaged by blasts in 1993 and 1998, respectively, members of the minority community have expressed hurt at meetings in the Maharashtra capital as well as in those elsewhere in the country.

 A source said several members of the Memon community met at Memon Hall in Mumbai on July 23. A couple of weeks later, on August 10, members of the minority community met in Hyderabad to discuss the convictions in the Coimbatore blasts case.

 The sentences awarded to elusive kingpin Tiger Memons family in the Bombay blasts case have been seen as victimisation of the community. At the same time, the non-implementation of the Srikrishna commission report has brought obvious reactions to the fore, the source added. 

 A few days after the Hyderabad meeting, an umbrella organisation called Muslim Peoples Movement for Justice was formed in Mumbai. Its objective: to address the non-implementation of the Srikrishna recommendations. 

 The commissions report blames both police officials and politicians for not preventing the 1992-93 Mumbai riots, and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi has told Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh to implement the commissions report in letter and spirit. 

 Jamait Ulema-e-Hind secretary and spokesperson Abdul Haneed Noumani conceded that the strongest feelings in the minority community right now are regarding non-implementation of the report. 

 People feel that those who looted and killed during the riots have not been punished but those who committed a crime after that in response, have been punished, he said. 

 A home ministry source echoed him. The source said there is a sense of disappointment, not just regarding implementation of the report, but also on the convictions as references have been made to the riots being a result of the Babri Masjid demolition.

 There is also disappointment on the lack of strong action on the post-Godhra riots in Gujarat, the source added. 

 Noumani, however, clarified that the bewkoofi (foolishness) like that of MIM leaders in Andhra Pradesh, who wanted writer Taslima Nasreen to be beheaded, should also not be forgiven.

 Noumani said while Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia want to play safe on the report, Deshmukh is still playing games. 

 More disconcerting, however, are reports of the rejuvenation of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India, which, home ministry sources said, is operating under the guise of several small organisations. 

 One of these, the Tehfaz-e-Sharai Islam, met on August 10 in Hyderabad, a source said. The issue was the convictions in the Coimbatore blasts case. 

 Recently, 13 accused in the Mumbai train blasts declared in court that they did not have faith in Judge Mridula Bhatkar. 

 Over the past few weeks, at least four meetings have been held in Mumbai by minority organisations. Government agencies have hinted that loss of faith in the system is increasingly being observed at such meetings.

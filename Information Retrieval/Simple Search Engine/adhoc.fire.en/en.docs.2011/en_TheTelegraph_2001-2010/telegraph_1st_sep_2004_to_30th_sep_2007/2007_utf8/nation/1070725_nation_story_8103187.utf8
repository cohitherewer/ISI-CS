 Visa decision not mine: Howard

 Melbourne, July 24 (PTI): Australian Prime Minister John Howard today denied pressuring the immigration minister into cancelling Mohammed Haneefs visa or leaking information to the media designed to taint the Indian doctor, charged with recklessly supporting a terrorist group.

 Haneef was granted bail by a Brisbane magistrate last Monday but a few hours later immigration minister Kevin Andrews revoked his visa. 

 Although Andrews cited character issues, deputy prime minister Mark Vaile has admitted that the revocation of Haneefs visa was designed to keep the doctor in Australia while his court case is under way.

 Howard said he had discussed Haneefs visa with Andrews and senior members of the cabinet, but had left it to the minister to decide on a course of action.

 We discussed it and it was discussed at a meeting of the national security committee of the cabinet, but the final decision was taken by Kevin Andrews, Howard told a local TV channel here.

 He exercised his discretion and we didnt seek to direct him. But often in these situations... the minister will seek the views of his colleagues and then go away and make his or her decision, theres nothing unusual about that.

 He declined to comment on the credibility of the prosecution case against Haneef which has been dogged by claims and counter-claims about the handling of the police investigation. But Howard insisted his government was not behind the leaks intended to tarnish the defendant.

 I havent leaked any information. No member of the government, to my knowledge, has leaked any information.

 The Prime Minister ridiculed Queensland Premier Peter Beatties call for a senate inquiry into the case, saying it was a matter for the courts.

 If (the police) do something thats wrong, well, the courts will take account of that, Howard said. But for people in my position or Beatties position to be running a partisan campaign on this, which he plainly is, is quite wrong and its very unhelpful to the fight against terrorism in this country.

 Yesterday, on an ABC programme, Howard expressed confidence in the Australian Federal Police and criticised Beattie for slamming the investigation. .

 Beattie responded by telling the programme that he was simply raising issues he believed the government needed to explain. Instead of answering the question, all they are doing is trying to vilify me, he said.

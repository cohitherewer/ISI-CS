 Young Turk passes away

 When Bhairon Singh Shekhawat was among the first leaders to condole Chandra Shekhars death, the irony was apparent: Shekhawat and the former Prime Minister belonged to different states and were anchored in opposing political ideologies and yet converged on crucial aspects of their careers. 

 Like Chandra Shekhar, Shekhawat ran a minority government. The difference was while the formers dispensation in the Centre lasted precisely 120 days, the Vice-President presided over his motley one, cobbled together with splits and Independent MLAs in the pre-anti-defection law era, successfully for 10 years.

 That wasnt all. Both were Thakurs. In the post-Mandal period, the bonding was cemented by the realisation that the Thakurs of the heartland should swim together, if they had to hold their own against the onward march of the OBCs and Dalits.

 Before Chandra Shekhar breathed his last, Shekhawat was the last recipient of his munificence. It was a statement of support for his presidential candidacy. 

 His death is a political and personal blow to Shekhawat and the NDA, which included his old socialist friend, George Fernandes.

 From starting out as a socialist under the tutelage of the legendary Uttar Pradesh leader, Acharya Narendra Dev, Chandra Shekhar veered towards the Congress in the mid-sixties. He thought he could influence the partys left-of-centre stream with his radical ideas on economic and social empowerment. For a while the conviction worked. Chandra Shekhar banded together like-minded comrades such as Mohan Dharia, Krishna Kant and Chandrajit Yadav who were known as the young Turks.

 But when the radicals overstepped their brief and began fighting for inner-party democracy anathema to Indira Gandhi Chandra Shekhar was marginalised. He joined J.P. Narayan and was arrested during the Emergency. 

 The next high-point of Chandra Shekhars career was the 4,260-km-long padyatra he went on from Kanyakumari to Delhis Rajghat in 1983, hoping to become a rallying point for anti-Congressism with an eye on the 1984 elections. Trust politics and more so, Indian politics to be capricious.

 Indira Gandhis assassination in 1984 scuppered Chandra Shekhars ambitions. 

 In yet another irony, he did become the Prime Minister in 1990. The vicarious pleasure of seeing the back of V.P. Singh, his rival, was washed away by the humiliation of bending over backwards to please the Congress which kept his minority government on a leash. 

 It was marked with controversies galore. India pawned gold to avert default on the repayment of international loans, there were Hindu-Muslim riots after the first assault on the Babri mosque and to top it all, the radical Chandra Shekhar had to explain why he allowed a US transport aircraft to refuel at an Indian airport during the Gulf War.

 The last straw was being accused of using the Haryana police to spy on Rajiv Gandhi.

 Out of power, Chandra Shekhar tried to stay afloat by alternately playing Bhisma pitamah, a kind of conscience-keeper of the government of the day, flirting with the idea of forming a fourth front and even having a shot at prime ministership again in a coalition formation.

 Nothing worked. In the post-Mandal era, he depended entirely on another old buddy, Mulayam Singh Yadav, to deliver his Ballia Lok Sabha seat. He lost it just once in 1984. But during the last election, when he was practically immobile, he admitted that if he won, it was thanks to Mulayam.

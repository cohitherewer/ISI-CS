 The other side of violence: Suicides

 Srinagar, Jan. 29: Dilshada Akhtar, a mother of two, has tried twice to end her life after her brother fell to the web of violence.

 The 47-year-old is one of thousands who have tried to kill themselves during the 18 years of militancy. She has survived but many others did not. Their list swells by the day.

 For those who survive, life is no better. My brother was 14 years younger than me. I had brought him up like a son, said Dilshada at her home in Srinagar. I always feel as if he is around somewhere.

 Since the outbreak of militancy in 1989, suicide attempts have risen sharply. Medecins Sans Frontieres, a global NGO, has found alarmingly high suicidal ideation among Kashmiris. Of the 571 people it interviewed, around 34 per cent said they had thought of ending their lives in the month preceding their interviews.

 The data is alarming in a predominantly Muslim culture that regards thoughts and acts of suicide as a grave sin, says the report, Kashmir: Violence and Health .

 The malaise doesnt end with thought. Many take action. From post-traumatic stress disorders and psychiatric problems to broken relationships, poverty and failure in examinations, the reasons are varied. But chronic traumatic stress is the main factor, said Dr Arshad Hussain, a psychiatrist at Srinagars main hospital, SMHS.

 The hospital came up with an exhaustive 22-month study in 2002, which found that suicide attempts had shot up after the rise of militancy. 

 In 1985-86, such cases were less than 1 per cent of total admissions to the hospital. In 2001-02, they were around 10 per cent, said Dr D.C. Kundal, who led the study. 

 The good thing is all physicians at the main hospitals in Srinagar have been sensitised about the problem, and the help of a psychiatrist is sought in every attempted suicide case here, Dr Hussain said.

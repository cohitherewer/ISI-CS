 Delhi lessons for Yangon junta 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 19: India has begun training the Myanmarese military, surprising major western powers who condemn Yangons junta and domestic supporters of the incarcerated Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the pro-democracy movement in that country. 

 Officers and crew of the Myanmar Air Force (Tamdaw Lay) are being trained at the naval air station, INS Garuda, in Kochi. The training of the personnel follows Indias gift of three British-made BN Islander aircraft to Myanmar. 

 Defence ministry sources say the aircraft were not being given free of cost but at friendly prices. The decision to extend military support to the junta flows from New Delhis concern and perception of deep Chinese interests in Myanmar. 

 India has gifted the Islander aircraft despite the objections of the UK, the original supplier of the aircraft to the Indian Navy. A decision to supply Myanmar with more Islander aircraft primarily used for surveillance, search and rescue was conveyed by navy chief Admiral Sureesh Mehta to Yangon in May. Following that visit, Myanmarese air crew have begun training in Indian military establishments. 

 The Indian Navy is phasing out all Islander aircraft in its fleet. It had inducted 19 Islanders in 1976 from the British. 

 Ironically, overriding British and US concerns, India is aggressively pursuing its military-to-military relations with Myanmar but fights shy of publicising them. 

 The navy chiefs visit was preceded by those of defence secretary Shekhar Dutt, army chief General J.J. Singh, who is also chairman, chiefs of staff committee, and before him external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee. 

 Last year, India agreed to supply the Myanmarese junta with 105mm field guns, T-55 tanks, rockets and rifles grenade launchers with ammunition. 

 When India first decided to gift the Islanders, the British High Commissioner in New Delhi had written to the Indian government conveying the UKs disapproval. That has not deterred India. 

 Even as it trains the Myanmarese military, India is also sending the navy chief to the UK. His visit will be followed by Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major. 

 The air force is also sending six IAF Sukhoi 30 Mki fighter aircraft, a refueller and an IL 76 heavy lift transporter in a wargame called Indradhanush with the UK Royal Air Force. The team of nearly 200 air warriors will also participate in a British military tattoo.

 15 killer cops jailed for life

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Sept. 11: Fifteen policemen who killed a physically challenged man resembling his criminal brother in Mulayam Singh Yadavs home district were jailed for life today.

 The body of Raj Kumar Tiwari was thrown into the crocodile-infested Chambal and never found.

 The conviction in an Etawah court, on September 5, was secured almost entirely on the accounts of eyewitnesses and a check of police bullets used in the January 1992 murder.

 Additional sessions judge R.P. Sharma said there was no mitigating factor to award a lighter term. However, Subhas Tripathi, the policemens advocate, said he would move Allahabad High Court against the order. 

 The crime branch, which probed the case, said the policemen asked Raj Kumar, quaking in fear at the sight of armed men in uniform, to surrender.

 But the 28-year-old, who only had one hand, panicked and began to run. The guns boomed and Raj Kumar fell into the river.

 The main witnesses to the January 28, 1992, murder in Etawahs Dadra village under Chakarnagar police station were cowherds.

 The victims family alleged that the police were looking for Ram Kumar, Raj Kumars elder brother, who had many cases against him. The siblings looked strikingly similar. Ram Kumar was also killed two years after his brother in a police encounter but his death stirred no controversy. 

 Sharmas court said the investigation proved beyond doubt that the policemen killed the man and then tried to destroy evidence by allowing the body to be devoured by the crocodiles.

 The police never made any attempt to fish out the body from the river, he said. The policemen claimed that the victim had drowned.

 IPS officers rapped

 The BSP government has suspended 10 senior IPS officers and recommended similar action against two others. 

 Suspension orders were issued in connection with a police recruitment scam during the previous Samajwadi Party regime.

 Trees bear protest brunt

 Jaipur, June 6: Peace may have returned to Rajasthan, but last weeks agitation by the Gujjars has left deep scars on the ecology of the state.

 The protesters felled thousands of trees to be used as roadblocks in Dausa and Sawai Madhopur two districts severely hit by the agitation.

 Even the former hunting ground of the maharajas of Jaipur, the Ranthambore National Park, has not been spared. Trees of various sizes and species have been felled in the sanctuary.

 The green cover in Rajasthan is already sparse. The felling of trees has added to our misery. It will take years for trees to grow again. It is a national loss, a forest department official rued.

 The department has decided to conduct a survey of the damage caused to the flora and fauna during the agitation.

 At some places, the damage is irreparable. Even shrubs that sustain livestock a major source of income for the mostly pastoral agitators have not been spared.

 Rajasthan has deciduous vegetation consisting of slow-growing thorny trees, shrubs and grasses, which have adapted to the harsh conditions.

 Although Gujjar leader Kirori Singh Baisna has promised to plant saplings, some protesters admitted that using trees to block roads was not a wise decision.

 It is not easy to go by the book in an agitation of this magnitude. We will try to undo the damage by planting saplings, said Kalu Lal in Mahuwa. 

 We know it will take years for trees to grow again, but we had no choice. We could not torch more vehicles. Nor could we uproot more electricity poles, he said.

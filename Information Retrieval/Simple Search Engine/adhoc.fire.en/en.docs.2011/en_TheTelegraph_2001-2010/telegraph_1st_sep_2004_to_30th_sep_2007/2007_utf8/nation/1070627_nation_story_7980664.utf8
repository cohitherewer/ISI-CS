 Luxury chopper for farmer CM

 Meet the farmer who cant do without a Rs 60-crore chopper. Y.S.R. Reddy has tried hard to send the message that hes a farmer at heart. Only, hes a high-flying one.

 By this year, his Bell helicopter will be replaced with one made by Italys Augusta Westland. The new chopper can fly 1,000 km at a stretch without refuelling, with 15 on board. A sum of Rs 17 crore was paid to place the order.

 Officials say the new chariot in air will save the money now spent on fuel and on extra choppers used to ferry security personnel. Reddy faces threats from Maoists outfits.

 He can fly to Hyderabad from the districts directly. He can also cover more areas in a hop, says Jannat Hussain, Reddys secretary. 

 Reddys home has a helipad. At the secretariat, two choppers can land at the same time. An earlier plan to fly him to office from home did not get off the ground. But, if the threats increase, the daily sorties might just begin.

 Watch your gifts, MLAs

 Time can be the best healer, but if the wounds are inflicted by the DMK, a lifetime of bitterness might not be enough.

 Jayalalithaa was left red-faced at the ADMK executive committee meeting last week when it emerged that some of her legislators had accepted wristwatches as gifts.

 She wouldnt have had a problem as long as they were accessories, but the trouble was, they werent. The watches were goodwill gifts handed by the DMK regime at the end of the recent budget session. Apparently, costly suitcases had also changed hands.

 Karunanidhi is not our friend, but our enemy. You cant accept gifts from them, Jayalalithaa is believed to have thundered. 

 The sheepish pack did not have much of a choice. Last heard, the watch receivers were under watch.

 Admission shuttles

 Students running from college to college in the searing June heat seeking admission to Delhi University have help on hand from an unlikely source. 

 Mobile service provider Airtel has started a free shuttle service on the north and south campuses of the university. The AC vans shuttle between all colleges on a route. 

 The shuttles run between 10 am and 1 pm the lunch hour at the university. Given the hassles and trouble that students undergo during admissions, it is a logical step to help them during these tough times, says Shashi Arora, Bharti Airtels chief operating officer for Delhi. 

 Students form a significant chunk of the mobile phone users in the capital and are the section of customers most telecom service providers court.

 Airtel has also set up admission information kiosks at convenient locations on the north and south campuses.

 Stray cases

 Claws are out in the city over a planned doghouse. The state government told Bombay High Court last week that two plots had been earmarked at Vasai and Palghar, on the citys outskirts, for the relocation of stray dogs. 

 The court directed the land to be handed over to the municipal corporation. But NGOs argued that sterilisation was a cheaper option than packing the canines off. They urged that the 1 lakh of the citys 5 lakh stray dogs that they have already sterilised should not be shifted.

 The corporation said a panel headed by the municipal commissioner has been set up under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act to address the NGOs concerns.

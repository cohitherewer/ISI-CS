 Haneef visa plea

 Melbourne, Aug. 20 (PTI): An Australian court will tomorrow decide on Mohammed Haneefs appeal to have his work visa reinstated. 

 Judge Jeffery Spender of the federal court in Brisbane had on August 9 reserved judgment on the Indian doctors appeal against immigration minister Kevin Andrews decision to revoke his visa on grounds of character. 

 Andrews said he had a reasonable suspicion that Haneef had associated with terrorists, specifically his second cousins Kafeel and Sabeel Ahmed, both allegedly involved in failed bomb plots in the UK in June. 

 However, Haneefs lawyers disputed the ministers use of the word association and questioned whether any relationship with an alleged criminal, even an innocent one, would be enough to justify a visa cancellation.

 Haneef, who worked as a junior doctor, was charged with recklessly providing support to a terrorist organisation on July 14.

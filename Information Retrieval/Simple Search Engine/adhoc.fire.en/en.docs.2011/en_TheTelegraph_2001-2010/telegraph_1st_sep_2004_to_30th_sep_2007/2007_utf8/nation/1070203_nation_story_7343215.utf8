 Atal cant cap Modi unrest

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: Atal Bihari Vajpayees vote of confidence on changes in the BJP central team hasnt stopped ripples of discontent from surfacing in the party. Resentment is particularly high over the ouster of Narendra Modi from the central parliamentary board.

 Vajpayee put his stamp of approval on the reshuffle, saying it was done with a lot of thought. 

 The team has the right balance. I am satisfied. There can be a difference of opinion. But the party president has made his team after giving it required thought and has tried to maintain unity, he said.

 However, BJP president Rajnath Singh continued to be under attack from some quarters, primarily for dropping Modi, and also for removing general secretary Arun Jaitley from the post of senior spokesperson.

 Action against Jaitley is being perceived as Rajnaths attempt to remove the political challenge to his authority. Jaitley was recently denied the opportunity to contest the Amritsar Lok Sabha bypolls. 

 Sources said there was an attempt to remove Jaitley from the general secretarys post as well as taking away the spokespersons job from him. But Rajnath had to restrain himself because such action would have led to open dissention and rifts within the party.

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), too, seems to have been struck by the response to the changes, especially those concerning Modi. 

 Rajnath had reportedly consulted Suresh Soni, the RSS veteran in charge of BJP affairs and Bal Apte, another Sangh member in the BJP, prior to shifting Modi out. 

 However, the Sangh now seems to be eager to placate Modi, who has made no secret of his unhappiness.

 Rajnath, on his part, let it be known that the move was meant to be a snub to Modi and that it had the support of Vajpayee and the Sangh.A senior RSS member said there was absolutely no reason to denigrate Modi, especially at a time when Gujarat is expecting Assembly elections.

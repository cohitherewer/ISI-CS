 Indore July 6: A 45-year-old widow suffering from AIDS was raped and strangled to death.

 Police recovered Pinki Berwes naked body a few metres from her shanty at Davendra Nagar this morning. The deaf and mute woman used to work at a farmhouse nearby. 

 Forensic officials said there were several wounds on her body, including serious injuries to her private parts.

 Officials at Annapura police station, near the spot where the body was found, said they found broken bangles and other evidence that point to more than one culprit. 

 She must have struggled, an official said, adding that the crime may have taken place in the wee hours. 

 There are signs the assailants broke into Pinkis house and dragged her away. The cause of the death is strangulation. A case has been registered and a manhunt is on.

 Pinkis husband Rakesh died of AIDS 10 years ago, leaving behind two daughters. The younger one died at the age of six a few years ago. The other, now 16, doesnt have the disease.

 Meera Shinde, a social worker, said she would look after Pinkys daughter.

 SRK basmati pot simmers

 Shah Rukh: Too expensive?

 New Delhi, July 3: Shah Rukh Khan might relish basmati. But the government cant digest a campaign in which he features on behalf of rice exporters.

 A Rs 21-crore campaign planned abroad has left a sour taste in the mouth of some rice growers and exporters, who have complained to the government that the marketing blitz with the Bollywood star is far too expensive.

 But Vijay Setia, the chairman of the All India Rice Exporters Association, is firm on getting the campaign rolling. 

 I will soon seek an appointment with senior officials of the commerce ministry and explain how this campaign, to be launched in Europe and West Asia, is important for the rice growers and the industry, he said.

 The association planned the promotions along with the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (Apeda). 

 Grey Worldwide and Crayon Advertising have been picked for the job. The money is to come from the Basmati Development Fund, which is a pool of cash created by contributions from exporters.

 One of the objections raised by the government is that the entire money in the fund will be spent on the campaign. But Setia argues that there is no point in keeping the cash idle. 

 What is the use of keeping this money in a fixed deposit when we can get a definite value addition from advertising? he asked. He says Indian exporters who are enjoying good times in the world market can bring back the sum in a matter of days. 

 The Rs 21-crore campaign has been split evenly into two segments Rs 10.50 crore each for West Asia and Europe, among the largest markets in the world for basmati.

 The fund is being managed by representatives of exporters and Apeda in a transparent manner, Setia said, and made it clear the campaign will not be dropped.

 But some are upset with the associations approach. Anil Mittal, who heads KRBL, one of the largest rice exporters, has snapped ties with Setias forum, saying the Shah Rukh campaign will not benefit exporters.

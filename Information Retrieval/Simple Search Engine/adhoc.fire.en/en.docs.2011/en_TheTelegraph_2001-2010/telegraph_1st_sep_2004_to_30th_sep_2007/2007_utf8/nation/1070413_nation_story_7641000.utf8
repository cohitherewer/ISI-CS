The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Colonel, cleric in dock

 MUZAFFAR RAINA 

 Srinagar, April 12: Jammu 

 and Kashmir police today filed a chargesheet against 11 

 people for the abduction and murder of a local 

 imam.

 Five army men, including a colonel, cleric Mohammad Ashraf Khan and five policemen were charged with murder, abduction, conspiracy and destruction of evidence before the court, said investigating officer and Hazratbal superintendent of police Javed Koul.

 Imam Showkat Ahmad Kataria was among the five people killed in the Ganderbal fake encounters last year.

 The police also blamed the army for non-cooperation in the investigations. Srinagars chief judicial magistrate Mohammad Yousuf Akhoon then directed Koul to inform all accused army men to be present in court for the May 3 hearing. 

 Defence spokesman Lieutenant Colonel A.K. Mathur, however, said it is untrue that army is not cooperating. 

 This is a loose statement. We are not above the law and we will continue our cooperation, he said. 

 Kataria was allegedly abducted by forces on October 5 and taken to Bazipora in Ganderbal where he was killed in custody. The police and the army allegedly carried out these fake encounters to pass off the victims as militants for promotions and rewards.

 The scam rocked Kashmir in February after the police exhumed their bodies to match DNA samples taken from their families. The samples of Kataria and another victim, Abdul Rahman Padroo, have tested positive. 

 Senior superintendent of police S.S. Parihar, his deputy Bahadur Ram who have been named in todays chargesheet and 11 others, mostly policemen, are already in the net for their alleged role in Padroos death, a carpenter from Kokernag.

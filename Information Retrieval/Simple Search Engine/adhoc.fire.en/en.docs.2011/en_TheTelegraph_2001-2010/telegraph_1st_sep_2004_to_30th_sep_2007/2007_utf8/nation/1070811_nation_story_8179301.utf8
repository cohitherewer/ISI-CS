 Bull Laden in Bengal net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dinhata, Aug. 10: Laden has been caught and exiled. 

 The four-legged menace dubbed Laden by residents of this town in Cooch Behar was known to charge at people without rhyme or reason. 

 So when the ox was captured after daylong efforts by 20 men hired by the district administration, the town heaved a collective sigh of relief. 

 The unruly beast was tied up using sacks and packed off to Adabarighat forest, 20km away, in a truck. 

 For the past five years, Laden had been terrorising the people of this town and we in the municipality had been bombarded with requests to get rid of it, said Ranjit Saha, a Forward Bloc councillor of the municipality.

 The animal had chased Saha a few years back when he was returning home in a rickshaw. It charged and overturned the vehicle, recalled Saha, happy to see the back of the animal today. 

 Despite repeated requests to police, the animal resources department and the civic body, Laden could not be trapped.

 The people from Stationpara had approached us a few days ago complaining that the oxs antics were becoming unbearable. It had of late taken to chasing schoolchildren, entering eateries and even pointing its horns at rickshaw-vans and school buses. So we decided to capture it, said Moni Kumar Ghalay, the joint block development officer of Dinhata.

 Ladens attacks have also caused death. Resident Partha Debnath said: Haripada Majumdar, an old man, was killed after the ox butted him a month ago.

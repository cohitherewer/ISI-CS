 Ahmedabad, March 8: Like many others before them, some of the countrys brightest business brains are ready to strike out on their own. But unlike their seniors, they also want a safety net.

 They want a placement holiday for a year.

 As placement season dawned at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, today, some final year students came up with a suggestion that they should be allowed to join the process after a year. That is, if their dream of being an entrepreneur fails to take off. But for now, they would like to pursue that dream.

 This is the first time that outgoing B-school students are thinking in terms of a contingency plan, lest their venture doesnt succeed.

 IIMA placement authorities have accepted the suggestion, which means students opting out of full-time recruitment will be eligible to join the placement process in the year 2008-09, placement committee chairperson professor Piyush Sinha said.

 Sinha denied that the idea of placement holiday was born out of lack of confidence. He said the authorities agreed just to assure those who want to take the plunge that they have a second chance in case they change their mind after a year. It is just a gesture on our part.

 So far, eight students who have opted out of placement since 2005 to pursue their entrepreneurial ambitions are doing well. There is nothing to suggest that they have failed in their venture, said a member of the IIM faculty.

 In 2005, two students had opted out and last year, six students spurned fat salary packages to start their own ventures. This year, Sinha expects the number to go up substantially. However, the clear picture will be known only after March 15, when the placement process ends.

 Students say the placement holiday will motivate young entrepreneurs to take the plunge. Its a good move and promotes entrepreneurship, said one student who refused to be named.

 Sources say at least 10 to 15 students are likely to opt out if the recently-held annual venture capital conclave is any indication.

 The meet saw more than 15 students discussing and making a pitch for future business plans with banks and investors.

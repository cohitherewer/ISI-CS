 For a change, CPM holds fire and waits

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 22: After raising concerns that India was giving in to the US in its talks on the nuclear deal, the CPM today came out with a surprisingly mild response to the claim that the two sides had sorted out their differences. 

 The CPM will formulate its stand on the outcome of the recent talks after studying the details of the talks, a statement from the politburo said. 

 But it noted that the party has already said an agreement on civilian nuclear cooperation can be based only on the assurances given by the Prime Minister in the August 17, 2006, statement in Parliament. And, by not accepting those provisions of the Hyde Act which are contrary to Indias interests. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had given 14 assurances to show that India would not compromise its interests during the negotiations. 

 But the CPM and the Left had insisted that the Hyde Act, the enabling US legislation, should be amended as its provisions will be binding on the pact during future regimes.

 However, the Indian team has gone ahead despite the Hyde Act not being amended. 

 Officials of both countries have claimed that the pact was tied up this week. The CPM could still come out with a response that will not be music for the Congress-led UPA, but for now the party has toned down its rhetoric against the deal.

 Left sources said they expect the Prime Minister to discuss the talks in Parliament during the monsoon session. 

 The end-June politburo meeting of the CPM had raised three concerns:

 nReprocessing rights on spent nuclear fuel 

 nGuarantee of fuel supply if the agreement is nullified, and

 nThe condition that India should return all nuclear equipment and fuel if it carried out nuclear tests 

 The party had said the UPA government is not talking about the terms and conditions of the Hyde Act which will govern the US side.

 But a day after there were claims from Washington that the deal has been clinched but for requisite political clearances, the CPM has chosen to be more studied.

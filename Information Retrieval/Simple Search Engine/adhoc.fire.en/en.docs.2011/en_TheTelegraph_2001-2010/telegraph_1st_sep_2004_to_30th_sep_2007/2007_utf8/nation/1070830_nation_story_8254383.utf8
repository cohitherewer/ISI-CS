 Food and water link to mob fury

 New Delhi, Aug. 29: The violence that engulfed Agra this morning had more to do with divisions and frustrations in society than with the truck accident that triggered the violence, according to social scientists. 

 The researchers say India appears primed for such incidents because of two key ingredients in the recipe that allows anger over accidents to snowball into mob-driven townwide conflagrations an environment that encourages people to associate themselves with specific identities, and a sense of frustration stemming from denial of rights. 

 Such violence is not unexpected at all and were bound to see more such incidents, said A.R. Vasavi, a professor of social anthropology at the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bangalore. 

 She said the perpetrators of mob violence are often themselves long-term victims of structural violence which is not necessarily physical violence, but a deprivation and denial of basic rights. 

 Inequity, malnutrition, lack of access to good water or education, or even malfunctioning law-enforcement systems are examples of this structural violence, Vasavi said. 

 Prolonged exposure to such conditions can allow frustration to build up. The mob violence that follows accidents or incidents is only a sign of this deep frustration and anger, she said. 

 Social psychologists say another factor that often allows violence to spiral out of control is an environment that fosters group identity a situation in which people tend to associate themselves with a particular group a religion, a caste or a social class. 

 When theres underlying frustration and theres a strong sense of group identity, its easy to whip up emotions, said Rajini Konantambigi, an associate professor at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai. 

 In such situations, certain cleverly-articulated remarks can touch an emotional chord and trigger mob violence, she said. 

 Theres an irrational aspect to human behaviour and it surfaces.

 But researchers say group socialisation and seeking identity are not confined to India. This occurs worldwide across societies and cultures. 

 They also caution that it would be wrong to assume that mob violence is primarily perpetrated by the poor or socially-deprived groups. There have been instances in the past where even privileged groups have indulged in violence. 

 The anti-reservation agitation by university students last year and the Gujarat riots are examples of such behaviour by the privileged, Vasavi said.

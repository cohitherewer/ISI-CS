Trust deficit, in Pak backyard

 New Delhi, April 3: While Pakistans banker Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz waxed eloquent on reducing the quot;trust deficit quot; between India and Pakistan over Kashmir in Delhi, in Islamabad the International Crisis Group (ICG) was emphasising a similar deficit between Pakistan and the people of the Northern Areas, part of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir under its control.

 The release of ICGs report - quot;Discord in Pakistans Northern Areas quot; - on the eve of the Saarc summit may be coincidental. However, what it says about Pakistans record in the area of Kashmir under its control makes for shocking reading. While President Pervez Musharraf demands that the Kashmiris be given the right to quot;self-governance quot; - one of the key aspects of his Kashmir proposals, he gives no such right to the people of the Northern Areas.

 quot;The Pakistani military, the ultimate arbiter of the countrys Kashmir policy, has kept the strategically sensitive federally administered Northern Areas under central control for fear that even a modicum of autonomy would translate into political empowerment and demands for self-governance, quot; the ICG report states.

 The ICG, a non-partisan and non-profit international organisation headed by former Australian foreign minister Gareth Evans, works to prevent conflicts worldwide. Its reports are considered scrupulously objective and are meant to influence policy. They are, therefore, taken seriously by governments the world over.

 The Northern Areas (Gilgit and Baltistan) had rebelled against the maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir and apparently supported full integration with Pakistan. However, Islamabad continues to keep the Northern Areas outside the purview of its constitution.

 The Northern Areas have no representation in Pakistans parliament. The region is governed by the Legal Framework Order of 1994 which the ICG report describes as quot;an administrative instrument used to strengthen its hold over the region while denying its residents basic political and civil rights. quot; This is unlike quot;Azad Jammu and Kashmir quot;, or Pakistan-occupied Kashmir as India calls it, which has nominal autonomy and its own constitution.

 In 1999, according to the ICG report, the supreme court of Pakistan had directed Islamabad quot;to extend, within six months, fundamental freedoms to the Northern Areas, allowing its people to be governed by their elected representatives. quot; Yet, it points out, quot;the region is still ruled by executive fiat from Islamabad through the federal ministry for Kashmir affairs and Northern Areas, whose minister is its unelected chief executive quot;.

 The Northern Areas legislative council, which although elected, is quot;powerless, and civil and military bureaucrats run affairs quot;.

 The ICG warns that the regions inhabitants are quot;embittered by Islamabads unwillingness to devolve power to its elected representatives, and a nationalist movement, which seeks independence, is gaining ground quot;. This cannot be good for Pakistan as the Northern Areas are strategically important for it - the Karakoram highway passes through the area and it is Pakistans only border with China.

 The report says that as a consequence of denial of political rights, there is quot;rise of sectarian extremism quot;. The ICG alleges that quot;Sunni jehadis quot; engaged in sectarian strife in the largely Shia Northern Areas have had the patronage of the military quot;first witnessed during General Zia-ul-Haqs rule (1977-1988). quot; It then goes on to claim: quot;Under President and army chief Pervez Musharraf, the military has retained its alliance with Sunni Islamists for multiple goals, domestic and external, further weakening the moderate forces in a region where religious extremism was once unknown. quot;

 The report concludes: quot;The democratic deficit in the Northern Areas will not, however, be redressed while Pakistan itself remains under military rule. Alienation and discord in the Northern Areas had receded under responsive, democratically elected governments in Islamabad. In the eight year of centralised authoritarian rule, however, Pakistans legitimacy in the region is fast declining. quot;

 More deaths in tea garden

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bharnobari Tea Estate (Alipurduar), March 2: The condition of the locked-out Bharnobari continued to be bleak though some funds trickled into the Raimatang, Chinchula and Kalchini tea estates of the Dooars.

 Two persons died at the Bharnobari estate over the past 24 hours, taking the toll to 72 since its closure in December 2005. Laxman Munda, 48, of Bharnobari out-division died yesterday, while Binu Kharia, 32, a resident of Jonathan line, passed away this morning. Medical reports say both were suffering from malnutrition. 

 The deaths come a day after governor Gopal Krishna Gandhis visit to the Ramjhora garden, where seven workers of the closed estate have died over the past 12 days.

 With the 2,250 labourers unpaid for over a year, the families cant get one square meal a day, let alone pay for treatment of ailments. Six residents at Bharnobari, including three children, were admitted to the Latabari health centre yesterday all of them suffering from malnutrition.

 A few labourers have been forced to take up jobs in dolomite quarries in Bhutan, while others have left for other parts of the country in search of work. 

 I am surprised to see patta tornewale log abhi patthar tor rahe hai (pluckers are now breaking boulders), Gandhi, moved by the plight of the workers, had said on Thursday.

 Tapan Nag, the secretary of Swadhikar, an NGO, said: Under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, workers of closed gardens are supposed to get 100 days work, but labourers here got work for only 26 and received wages for 21 days. 

 According to Nag, Antyodaya cards have not been distributed among labourers, as a result of which equal amounts of foodgrain are not being handed out in the food-for-work scheme.

 P.D. Pradhan, the sub-divisional officer, however, said: Though the cards havent been distributed, the workers have been receiving ration regularly. 

 A Jomi Raksha Committee team from Calcutta visited the garden today as part of their survey of closed tea estates in the Dooars.

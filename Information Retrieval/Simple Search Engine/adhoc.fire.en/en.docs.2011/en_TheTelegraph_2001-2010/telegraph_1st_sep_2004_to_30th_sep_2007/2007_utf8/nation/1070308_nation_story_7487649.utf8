 Judges want the corrupt hanged 

 New Delhi, March 7 (PTI): Observing that everyone wants to loot this country, the Supreme Court today said the only way out was to hang the corrupt on the lamp post.

 The only way to rid the country of corruption is to hang a few of you on the lamp post. The law does not permit us to do it but otherwise we would prefer to hang people like you to the lamp post, a bench of Justices S.B. Sinha and Markandeya Katju said during arguments by the counsel for an accused.

 As counsel R. Singh tried to make a submission, Justice Katju said: Everywhere we have corruption. Nothing is free from corruption. Everybody wants to loot this country. The only solution for this menace is to hang some people in public so that it acts as a deterrent on others.

 These scathing observations came during the hearing of a bail application moved by Braj Bhushan Prasad, a dismissed employee of the Bihar government. He was allegedly involved in the Rs 1,000-crore fodder scam in which railway minister Lalu Prasad is also an accused.

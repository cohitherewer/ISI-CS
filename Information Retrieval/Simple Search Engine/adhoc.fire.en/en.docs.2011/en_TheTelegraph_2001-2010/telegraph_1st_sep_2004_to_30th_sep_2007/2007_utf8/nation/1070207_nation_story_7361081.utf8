 Multiplexes junk Parzania

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 A still from Parzania

 Ahmedabad, Feb. 6: Parzania, the film about a Parsi couples real-life search for their teenage son lost in the Gujarat riots, will not be shown in multiplexes in the state, in another show of might by the Bajrang Dal.

 The Multiplex Owners Association took the decision after producer-director Rahul Dholakia refused to allow Babu Bajrangi, a Bajrang Dal leader alleged to be the mastermind of the Naroda-Patia massacre in which 83 people died, to attend a special screening.

 The Naseeruddin Shah-Sarika starrer was released in theatres across the country except Narendra Modis Gujarat in the Republic Day week after it was cleared by the censor board.

 A special screening was held for multiplex owners in Gujarat who thought the censor boards clearance was not enough and wanted to judge for themselves whether they should show the film.

 He is neither a censor board member nor a theatre owner. So what business has he to judge the film? Dholakia argued with Manubhai Patel, president of the association.

 Dholakia, who held a meeting with association members at Wide Angle mutliplex today, said: Multiplex owners here fear some kind of vandalism if the movie is screened in the multiplexes of Ahmedabad. Hence they have refused to screen the movie They are being directed by somebody to do that.

 I am very sad at the development. This movie is about a Gujarati boy who is missing from this state. When the people of the country are watching this movie, why cant the people of Gujarat watch this movie in cinema halls? the disappointed director said.

 Patel had said he was willing to screen the film from February 9 if he got the go-ahead from Babu Bajrangi. Today, he said the multiplexes have decided against showing the film because it is likely to create disturbance.

 Babu Bajrangi said the fact that Dholakia did not want him to see the film proved there was something very objectionable in it. Dholakia, he said, fears that we will oppose and raise objection which, in any case, we will even if the film is screened in single-screen theatres. 

 Dholakia is pinning his hopes on standalone theatres. I will be approaching single-screen theatre owners. Im talking to some of them, he said, adding the film will be released in Gujarat if even one hall is ready. Shrugging off any possible threat from the Bajrang Dal, he said: If they disrupt, police will take care.

 Tendulkar in brand tussle

 OUR BUREAU

 March 17: First, Reliance lost Hutch. Now, it has lost Sachin to Hutch, at least for the duration of the World Cup.

 On the day India kicked off its campaign in the Caribbean, Sachin Tendulkar has reportedly asked Reliance Communications to withdraw all ads that have him endorsing their products.

 The star bat was forced to take the step after Hutch, one of the official global sponsors for World Cup 2007, complained to the ICC that he was indulging in what was called ambush marketing.

 The company has taken it up with the ICC, saying this is illegal. None of the players who are participating in the World Cup can endorse competition because Hutch is the global sponsor of the ICC World Cup, a Hutch spokesperson said.

 Hutch LG Electronics, Pepsi and Hero Honda are the other global sponsors wrote to the world cricket body about the ad over a week back but it has so far not taken any action, the spokesperson said.

 BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah played down the incident when contacted by The Telegraph but said Sachin had already spoken to Reliance. Yes, we are aware of the complaint. We know that under the rules no player is allowed to promote a rival company of the official sponsors during the tournament, he said. 

 We have spoken to the cricketer concerned who, in turn, has spoken to Reliance. The company, I believe, has withdrawn the ad.

 A Reliance Communications spokesperson, when contacted, said: No comments. 

 This is the second time in recent days that Anil Ambanis RCOM has ended up on the losing side. It was one of the bidders for Hutch Essar but lost out to UK-based Vodafone.

 Ambani was gracious in defeat but theres no denying his determination to beat the tough competition from GSM players like Airtel and Hutch.

 RCOM employs both CDMA (code division multiple access) and GSM (global systems for mobile communications) technologies, while Hutch Essar entirely uses GSM technology. RCOM employs GSM technology in a few circles, including Bengal.

 Renkoji pot simmers

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 New Delhi, March 10: The urn said to contain the ashes of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose will have to wait another day before it finds its rightful owner.

 In keeping with the highly-charged nature of the controversy over Boses alleged remains, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee will not be visiting the Renkoji temple, where the urn is kept, when he visits Tokyo on March 21.

 However, Mukherjee is said to have begun the process of political consultations so that the ashes can be subjected to a DNA test and, thereafter, be treated with the honour they might deserve.

 Sources said Mukherjee has spoken to Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in this connection and has also had a word with some MPs of the Forward Bloc, the party Netaji founded.

 Mukherjee, it is said, suggested that if the DNA test was positive, a fitting memorial could be built for the ashes either in Calcutta or at Red Fort in New Delhi. 

 But, the sources said, nobody wants to be seen as having taken a decision on Netajis alleged remains.

 Netajis daughter Anita Pfaff also wants the ashes back, but most interestingly, the priest of the Renkoji shrine, under whose charge they have been for the last 50 years, is ageing and wants a decision to be taken.

 It is also said the Japanese government would like India to reach a decision, especially after Delhi rejected the report of the Mukherjee Commission, which was probing Boses alleged disappearance, that the ashes were not Netajis.

 After all, a Japanese source said, 50 years is long enough to know, one way or another.

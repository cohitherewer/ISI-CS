 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Nandigram, March 22: Ten members of the Red Brigade were paid Rs 1.9 lakh in advance by a high-profile leader in East Midnapore district to recapture land in Nandigram, police said today.

 The revelation was made in a confidential report prepared by district superintendent of police A. Srinivas.

 All 10 have confessed that they were assigned the job by a high-profile leader. But they have not disclosed his name, Srinivas told The Telegraph.

 The 10 had been arrested from a brick kiln at Sher Khan Chowk under Khejuri police station. 

 Of them, Ambikesh Gorai, 53, is a CPM local committee member of Argoal in Patashpur and Kanai Das, 58, is a zonal committee member of Pratapdighi. The mastermind, however, is 29-year-old Naru Maity of the DYFI, according to the police. 

 Srinivas said the police have handed the preliminary findings to the CID, which will submit a detailed report to the court in the next few days.

 During their interrogation, the 10 confessed that they had been brought to the brick kiln on March 12 and were provided shelter by the CPMs Khejuri local committee, an official said.

 They told us that Rs 1.9 lakh was paid as advance and another Rs 2 lakh was supposed to be given after completion of the job. They had been sent to attack villagers and help CPM cadre reoccupy land in Nandigram, he added.

 The 10 also said Rabiul Hasan, the CPM local committee secretary in Khejuri, was aware of the game plan, according to the official.

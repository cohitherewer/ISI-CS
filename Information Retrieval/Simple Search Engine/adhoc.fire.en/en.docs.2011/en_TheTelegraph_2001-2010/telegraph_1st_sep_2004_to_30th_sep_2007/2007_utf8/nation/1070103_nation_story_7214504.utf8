The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Comrade clash worries CPM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 2: If Mamata Banerjee is Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees headache, his Kerala counterpart has to contend with a fellow comrade.

 Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan is wrestling with problems thrown up by CPM state secretary Pinarai Vijayan and his followers in the states LDF government.

 Party general secretary Prakash Karat told colleagues on the first day of the central committee meeting here today that the feud in Kerala was hurting the CPMs image.

 The differences within the party and government in Kerala are only damaging the partys image and immediate efforts should be taken for unity, Karat said in a report. The committee will discuss peace-making proposals for Kerala on Wednesday. 

 I cant disclose details but the politburo has discussed the Kerala situation, said party veteran Jyoti Basu. Achuthanandan had met Basu and sought his help.

 Kerala CPM leaders say the latest row involves two pro-Vijayan ministers who signed loan agreements with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) with conditions that give the overseas institution a say in decision-making.

 Achuthanandan, who stormed to power in Kerala after a high-voltage tussle with the state leadership, claims he and his other cabinet colleagues were kept in the dark about the agreements. 

 But Vijayan insists the decision was taken at the party state secretariat, and in the chief ministers presence. 

 The CPM unit in Bengal, whose regime has taken loans and grants from overseas agencies for development projects, was being seen by the Vijayan camp as a natural ally in a central committee discussion on the Kerala crisis.

 But the partys Bengal unit has its own worries. 

 Some of us, like Achuthanandan, carry our ideological baggage. Any discussion on foreign loans may open a Pandoras box, a central committee member from Bengal said.

 BJP grabs secrecy ammo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 24: The silence surrounding Ottavio Quattrocchis arrest has lifted just in time for the Opposition. 

 The budget session has just begun and the Congress is already getting it Left and Right, with a promise for more when the House convenes on Monday.

 Although the BJP has clearly taken the lead, the CPM, too, has demanded all-out efforts to bring Quattrocchi back an indication that the government cannot look to the Left for support over the issue in Parliament.

 ADMK chief Jayalalithaa was also quick to react. She described the development as a sign of time running out for the Congress.

 Calling it the perfect note to begin the budget session, BJP office-bearers passed a special resolution on Quattrocchi at their meeting this morning. 

 The resolution, like the statement issued by the CPM politburo, demanded that the Italian businessman be brought back to face trial in the Bofors case.

 The Congress connived with the CBI to save Quattrocchi. The idea behind concealing the fact of his arrest was to allow enough time to lapse so that he is released without anyone here coming to know, senior leader Arun Jaitley said.

 The Congress, Jaitley added, did not want the secret out in the run-up to elections in Punjab and Uttarakhand.

 Let us be clear, Quattrocchi is Sonia Gandhis gift to India. He was the middleman in a lot of deals, including Bofors, he said. 

 The Congress has tried to bury this embarrassing secret over the years. He was allowed to escape from India when, even after repeated requests from the CBI, the Narasimha Rao government did not allow his passport to be impounded. Then, the present government allowed his accounts to be de-frozen in a London bank.

 Jaitley said the Congress is trying to save Sonia Gandhi. The CBI is being used for the purpose.

 According to Jayalalithaa, an urgent meeting was convened by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on February 18 to discuss the arrest with top intelligence officers and senior ministers. 

 But nothing was revealed to the media though the law minister and the home minister reportedly discussed the issue, she alleged.

 The BJP parliamentary party met in the evening at Atal Bihari Vajpayees house to discuss Mondays strategy for both Houses. 

 Well make a cocktail of Lalu Prasad and the railways, a senior leader told The Telegraph, indicating that the party would disrupt proceedings on Monday when the minister presents the rail budget.

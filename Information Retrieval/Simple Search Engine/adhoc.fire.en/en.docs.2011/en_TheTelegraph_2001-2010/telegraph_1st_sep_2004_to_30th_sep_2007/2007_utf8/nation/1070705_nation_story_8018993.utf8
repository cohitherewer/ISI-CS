 No tolerance for Goa raves

 Panaji, July 4 (PTI): The Goa government today said it would adopt a no-tolerance attitude towards rave parties in the state.

 You just wait and watch.... There will be no rave parties this year. Curbing trade in narcotics in the state is top among our priorities, home minister Ravi Naik said.

 Goa, a popular destination for domestic and foreign tourists, has gained notoriety for drug trafficking and rave parties organised along its 105km coastline.

 We are taking all possible measures to tackle the drug menace. The government will go to the root of the problem and book the main offenders, Naik said.

 All foreigners who overstay in Goa under false pretexts will be asked to leave the country immediately.

 Even if they are held back because they have some petty cases filed against them, we will drop the charges and ask the foreigners to leave, Naik said.

 The government has also decided to clamp down on foreign students, especially Nigerians, who arrive here with student visas and are involved in drug trafficking.

 We will check their (students) attendance and if they are regularly absent, they will be asked to pack their bags, he said. 

 Data obtained from police reveal that the anti-narcotics cell, a special section commissioned to curb drug trade since 1997, registered 24 cases involving 25 Indians and 10 foreigners in 2006.

 Police stations had booked seven cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and arrested eight Indians and three foreigners.

 Naik said the drug cases have nothing to do with tourism, but are purely a law and order situation.

 The genuine tourists would not be at discomfort while those with perverted minds will not be tolerated, the home minister added.

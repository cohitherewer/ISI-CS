 Patna, May 20: An executive of Tata Indicom died after he was allegedly thrown from a tenth-floor apartment where he had gone to meet a central administrative tribunal judge today.

 Police said the death was a result of the scuffle with robbers who broke into the apartment but neighbours said several questions remained unanswered.

 Inspector-general Rajvardhan Sharma told The Telegraph that Tata Indicom assistant general manager Suresh Mahto had gone as a guest to administrative tribunal judge Sadhna Shrivastavas house in the upscale Buddha Colony. 

 The inspector-general said the robbers barged into the judges flat around 3.30 pm and began robbing jewellery and cash. Suresh tried to resist, Sharma said, quoting the judges domestic help. 

 The domestic help and other members of Sadhnas family have told the police that the criminals, who were armed, pushed Mahto onto the terrace.

 He lost his balance, fell from the 10th floor and died on the spot. 

 Eyewitnesses said Mahto had only his underwear on. No other clothes were found on his body that lay in a pool of blood, they added. 

 The police did not explain why a man resisting a robbery was dressed that way or whether the assailants had stripped him. 

 Nor was any explanation given on how the alleged robbers could break into a top officials house in broad daylight.

 Mahto had come to Sadhnas house from Lucknow, where he was posted, this morning. He had registered himself as Sadhnas guest in the visitors register. Some neighbours said Mahto was a frequent visitor.

 Sadhna, in her early forties, is single. 

 Inspector-general Sharma said: Further investigations are in progress.

 Mahtos body has been sent to Patna Medical College and Hospital for post-mortem. 

 One of the suspected robbers was arrested later but no details were given on the place or time of his capture or how the police tracked him down.

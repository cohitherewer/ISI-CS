 House attack

 Bangalore, Sept. 18 (PTI): Suspected Sangh parivar activists hurled a petrol bomb and stones at the house of M. Karunanidhis daughter Selvi in Bangalore tonight.

 The 50-strong group that attacked the house was shouting slogans against the DMK chief for his remarks on Ram, police said. They also pasted a poster on the house condemning Karunanidhis statement questioning Rams existence. 

 Two security personnel were injured in the attack that damaged windowpanes. 

 Selvi and her husband Selvam, who heads the Sun TV groups Kannada channel Udaya TV, were in Chennai.

 A Tamil Nadu government bus bound for Bangalore was set on fire at Bommanahalli, about 35km from here.

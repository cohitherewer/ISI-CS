 Calcutta, Feb. 2: The CPM will seek reservation for Dalit and OBC Muslims and ask the Centre to provide incentives to industry, business groups and educational institutions aimed at encouraging the entry of Muslims, party sources said. Congress leaders have made similar suggestions.

 While asking the UPA government to clarify its position on reservation and other affirmative action for Muslims, the party will tell its governments in Bengal, Kerala and Tripura to take up action plans for Muslims. Separate allocations will be sought within central plans.

 Insiders say the CPM politburo is likely to finalise a charter of demands for the development of Muslims at its February 12 meeting. Based on the Sachar panels findings and recommendations, these plans will seek to improve their education, employment, social justice and security.

 The Sachar committee said Muslims lacked education and job opportunities, even in Left-ruled states. On some counts, they fared worse than scheduled castes.

 The CPMs central leadership has set up a panel comprising the partys Muslim MPs and leaders to fine-tune its policies for minorities before the Uttar Pradesh polls. Its members are talking to Muslim organisations like Jamait-e Ulema-e Hind, Jamait-e-Islami, MIM, IUML, Milli Council, NGOs and intellectuals to understand the needs and aspirations of Muslims in India.

 The Sachar committee report has underlined the fact that no inclusive growth is possible if the largest community among minorities lacks the opportunities to fulfil their educational and livelihood aspirations. 

 Our party wants the Centre to develop the institutional mechanism and policy framework to create a democratic space for the community. This will help fight the fundamentalists and isolationists, CPM central committee member Mohammed Salim told The Telegraph. 

 The party feels its secular credentials will not be compromised if it seeks reservation for Dalits and OBCs in the community. The Sachar committee report said Muslims are divided into three main groups along caste lines Asrafs (descendants of foreign nobles and higher-caste converts), Ajlafs (equivalent to Hindu OBCs) and Arzals (equivalent to Hindu SCs). 

 Muslims comprise 15.7 per cent of the countrys OBCs, but 40.7 per cent of Muslims are backward castes. The Sachar panel has favoured putting Dalit Muslims on the SC list. Or, it says, they can be recognised as most backward classes. This could be carved out of the general OBC cate-gory.

 But the CPM seems to be divided on whether the Constitution should be amended to facilitate reservation for all Muslims, regardless of class and caste. Some fear the party could be accused of playing the politics of religion or minorityism. 

 Party leaders have pointed out that the share of Muslims in Bengal government jobs is only 4.2 per cent, though they make up 25.2 per cent of the states population. 

 There is no quota for Muslim OBCs in Bengal. In Kerela, 10 to 12 per cent of government jobs are reserved for them, the leader said. Only 12 states sent data on employment of Muslims to the Sachar panel. Bengal had failed to provide complete data in usable format.

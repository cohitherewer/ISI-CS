 Space salute to Gandhi

 Ahmedabad, Sept. 20: To the cheering students she was an Indian pure and simple, but Sunita Williams probably didnt mind the inaccuracy.

 If space travel had taught her one thing, the Indian-American said, it was that there are no borders.

 When I was in the space station, 400km from Earth, this planet looked so beautiful, full of colours: red, green and blue. Amazing shapes, no borders, Sunita said at Sabarmati Ashram this evening. Borders are only in our minds.

 She added: Mahatma Gandhi knew this without going to space.

 Sunita, who landed in the country this morning on a six-day visit, was accompanied by father Deepak Pandya, a doctor who had emigrated to the US in the 1950s. She was overwhelmed to see so many children, who waved to her from the audience.

 She started off with a namaste and switched to English for a brief speech, which her sister-in-law translated into Gujarati.

 On the dais with Sunita and her relatives were state Congress leaders.

 The children could not even get close, let alone quiz her about her space walk. A girl collecting messages to be handed over to the visitor was rudely shooed away by security.

 Before leaving after an hour, Sunita wrote in the ashrams visitors book: Borders are only in your minds.

 She came up against a barrier at her next destination, Nehrunagar, where she was to garland a statue of slain minister Haren Pandya, her cousin and a bitter enemy of chief minister Narendra Modi. Sunita could not even get off the car as a huge crowd surrounded the vehicle for half an hour.

 Only four to five policemen were posted, said Harens father Vitthalbhai. 

 Sunita was driven to Vitthalbhais home and returned later tonight to pay homage to her cousin.

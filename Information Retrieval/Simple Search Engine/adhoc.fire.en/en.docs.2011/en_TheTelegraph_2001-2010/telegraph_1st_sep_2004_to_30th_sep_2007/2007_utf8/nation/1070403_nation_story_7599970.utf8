 Mumbai set to lose power-cut immunity

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 DARK DAYS AHEAD

 Mumbai, April 2: A summer of daily power cuts is looming over Mumbai.

 Officials of power utilities today said the metropolis, so far insulated from the load-shedding tormenting the rest of the state, could be plunged into darkness for one to two hours as the authorities grapple with a power crunch across the state.

 The shadow fell over Mumbai on a day a government committee presented a report towards making the city an international finance centre.

 Sporadic power cuts were reported last week in areas covered by Reliance Energy, like Bandra. 

 Given the 150-200 mw shortfall this summer, the state has no alternative but to snap power connections for an hour or two every day. 

 If implemented, this could be the first time since the 1971 India-Pakistan war that Mumbai would have to suffer voluntary power cuts.

 Power cuts for one or two hours across the city is likely to be enforced during the next two months, Tata Power managing director Prasad Menon told reporters.

 Menon promised to make last-ditch efforts to purchase additional power from captive power units. But, he added, it was doubtful if that would be enough.

 Officials said the utilities may now have to turn to states like Uttar Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh and Orissa to source the required power at a higher rate, Rs 7 per unit. 

 State secretary for power Rahul Asthana had yesterday convened an emergency meeting of power utilities. Top officials of Tata Power, Reliance Energy, the Bombay Electric Supply and Transport and state utility Maharashtra Generation Company (Mahagenco) were present.

 Tata and Reliance supply 1,700 mw and 500 mw, respectively, to Mumbai, while Mahagenco supplies power to the rest of the state.

 To meet the rising demand for power in Mumbai, Tata had procured 200 mw of power from Jharkhand, Sikkim and the Hyderabad-based Lanco. Still short by 200 mw, Tata drew from the Mahagenco grids during peak hours last month.

 At yesterdays meeting, Mahagenco officials complained that with Tata drawing power, the load-shedding schedules for the rest of Maharashtra were going haywire. Asthana then served an ultimatum on Tata to arrange for an alternative source by April 4.

 Maharashtra, facing an estimated shortage of 5,000 mw this summer, had to implement power cuts ranging from four to 12 hours as early as February this year. 

 The rural areas have been the worst sufferers, going without power for even 14 hours on some days.

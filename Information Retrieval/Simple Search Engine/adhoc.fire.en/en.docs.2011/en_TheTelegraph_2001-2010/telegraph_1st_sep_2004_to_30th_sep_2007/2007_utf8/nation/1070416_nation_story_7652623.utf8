 Varun seals lips on family

 Varun: Gandhis missing

 Pilibhit, April 15: Varun Gandhi is part of the Uttar Pradesh battle, but he isnt exactly crossing swords with cousin Rahul.

 I cant use foul words against a family from which I have inherited my title, he says when asked about his perceived softness towards the first family of Indian politics.

 Those words havent only disappointed those looking for some election entertainment, but also local leaders of the BJP for whom hes holding roadshows in Pilibhit, the constituency that has sent his mother Maneka to Parliament. 

 There are other signs of the showdown shyness. Yesterday, not long after hed launched his campaign at Puranpur, Varun left when Rahul arrived to a huge crowd.

 The BJP gave away tickets for Assembly seats in the constituency after consulting Maneka. Varun, sources say, has vowed to see most of the eight candidates through. His campaign themes: development issues, price rise and the hardship of people. The Gandhis are missing.

 The BJP, which Varun joined with his mother in 2004, doesnt appear too upset. We respect his sentiment. But other BJP leaders are compensating with their tirade against Sonia Gandhi and the UPA, says senior leader B.K. Gupta. He says he is happy with the way Varun has taken on candidates with an anti-social background.

 Varuns relations with the BJP arent the best. Having failed to field him for the Lok Sabha from Madhya Pradeshs Vidisha, apparently because of resistance from local workers, it decided to give him a ticket from Mirzapur. Varun refused. 

 He could have contested from Mirzapur, an eastern Uttar Pradesh constituency with a sizeable Brahmin population. Varun was a good choice because he could have won by using his youth and crowd-pulling abilities, said a BJP general secretary. If that happened, he said, Varun would have matched Rahul as a key player in Uttar Pradesh. 

 But Varun has his own reasons. I am not familiar with Mirzapur. I would like to work for a constituency I am familiar with.

 India to raise visa issue

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 16: Commerce minister Kamal Nath today said he would raise the H-1B visa issue with US trade representative Susan Schwab at the G-4 meeting in Brussels tomorrow.

 Nath said it would be difficult for India to enhance its commitments in the services negotiations in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) unless there was forward movement by trading partners like the US. 

 He said the US move on utilisation of the special H-1B visa by Indian IT companies was aimed at restricting movement of skilled professionals and would have an adverse impact on the rapidly expanding services trade.

 Services are an important component of the breakthrough in the WTO negotiations and any move which vitiates the current progress will only frustrate the progress in bringing the round to a successful completion. 

 I would like to assure Indian industry that India will not subscribe to any WTO conclusion without a satisfactory outcome in services, he said.

 In previous discussions, I have informed ambassador Schwab that while India continues to liberalise its services economy, it expects at least equal movement from important trading partners like the US in areas of our interest like Mode-4 which cover the movement of professionals, he said in a written statement issued here.

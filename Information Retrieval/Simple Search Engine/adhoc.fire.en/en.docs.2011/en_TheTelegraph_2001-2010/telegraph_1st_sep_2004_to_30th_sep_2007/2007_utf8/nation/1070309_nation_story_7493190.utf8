 Swiss blow to Q probe

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 Quattrocchi

 New Delhi, March 8: The CBI probe to track the Bofors kickbacks allegedly received by Ottavio Quattrocchi has hit a wall with the Swiss authorities refusing to offer any assistance to India on grounds that the long-drawn prosecution has failed to produce a conviction. 

 As may be taken from the decision dated Jan. 24, 2007 (which has become final in the meantime), it is not possible under Swiss law to continue a matter of money laundering when the prosecution of the underlying crime has not resulted in a conviction so far and its continuation is now barred by the rule of lapse of time, the agency said in an affidavit before the Supreme Court today.

 The CBI rejected charges it wasnt doing enough to extradite the Italian businessman after he was held in Argentina on February 7. It also brushed aside charges it had held back information about the detention during a hearing last month. The submissions made on February 12 were specifically made on the plea seeking to retrieve the money Quattrocchi withdrew after the freeze on his United Kingdom accounts was lifted, it argued. 

 The CBI pointed out that it had taken steps for the extradition immediately after being informed about the detention. Quattorocchi was held a day after Interpol apprehended him at the Iguazu International Airport in Misiones. The steps for the extradition were being taken since February 7, before the February 12 hearing, the CBI said.

 However, the agency was silent on the date when the chief metropolitan magistrate before whom the case is pending was informed about the detention. 

 Reports on the extradition efforts are being sent to the magistrate.

 A fresh non-bailable warrant against him was obtained from the magistrate on February 24, a day after reports of the detention first appeared in the Indian media.

 The CBI said it had gone as far as requesting the Interpol not to release Quattorocchi after receiving a confirmation about his arrest on February 8. Extradition documents had been sent to Argentina through diplomatic channels on March 1, well within time, it said. 

 The agency accused advocate Ajay Agarwal, who moved the plea seeking immediate steps to ensure extradition, of filing a baseless application aimed at gaining publicity. 

 Agarwal, who had also filed an appeal against the acquittal of the Hinduja brothers in the Bofors case, was doing nothing less than carrying out a full fledged media trial, the CBI said. The Delhi lawyer had contested the verdict after the CBI failed to file an appeal.

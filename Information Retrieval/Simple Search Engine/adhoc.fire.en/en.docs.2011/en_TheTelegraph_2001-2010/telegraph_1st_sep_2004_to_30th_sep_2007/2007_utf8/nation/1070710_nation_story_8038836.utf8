 Boss versus Big Bosses

 - Cong Member moves hc over photos

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, July 9: Rajnikanth should be worried guest appearances by two political leaders threaten to upstage the superstar in his mega blockbuster. If it doesnt get banned, that is.

 A Congress member has petitioned Madras High Court for a ban on Sivaji-The Boss on the ground that it defames Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh.

 M. Sathiyamoorthys argument is that a photograph kept on the office table of the movies villain, Adikesavan, shows him flanked by the Prime Minister and the Congress president.

 This clearly defames our Congress leaders not just within Tamil Nadu and the country but all over the world after the films grand release in several countries, Sathiyamoorthy, who is also a lawyer, said.

 What the PIL, expected to be heard tomorrow, has ensured is that audiences will now keep their eyes skinned for the picture, which the petitioner says appears in four scenes.

 Several film buffs said they had not noticed the photograph when they watched the film. I dont remember seeing such a photograph of the villain, said Saidai Anbudasan. 

 Why should I have noticed, anyway? The film is a grand piece of entertainment, thats all. Rajni looks much younger in it and people are enjoying the film for its entertainment value.

 The petitioner says the photograph can be seen every time the hero, played by Rajnikanth, meets Adikesavan, the avaricious head of a private university that charges a huge capitation fee. The hero wants to start a university that will impart free education.

 Another moviegoer said he remembered Rajnikanth visiting the villains office, but just once and not four times. 

 People hardly notice such things (like a photograph lying inconsequentially on a table) in a film like this, he shrugged.

 They do if they are Congress loyalists, believes Sathiyamoorthy. 

 He said the film had bewildered party supporters by portraying their leaders as supporting bad people and gave the impression that the villain belonged to the Congress. We dont just want these scenes deleted but a ban on the movie, he said.

 The petitioner has sought a compensation of Rs 50 crore to be paid to the state Congress from Rajnikanth, producer AVM Saravanan and director Shankar.

 S.C. Babu, the CEO of movie production house AVM Productions, said he could react only after seeing a copy of the petition. 

 But he added: The PIL is not against the film per se. Its against the star, the producer and the story writer-director.

 The film had generated enormous hype across the state, with Rajnikanths fans dancing on the streets during its recent global release.

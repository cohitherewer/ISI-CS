 Civilians 

disobey Naxalites, shot dead

 SHASHANK SHEKHAR

 Bokaro, April 7: Six persons, including four civilians, were killed in a Maoist attack on the CISF camp at Khasmahal, 300 metres from Bokaro Thermal Township, yesterday. 

 Heavy explosives and grenades had ripped through the seven rooms in the camp while a CISF truck, parked inside the camp, appeared to have borne the brunt of a mine blast.

 After resisting the attack for four hours, the outnumbered CISF personnel abandoned the camp. 

 The Maoists used country-made rocket launchers to keep reinforcements away. Molotov cocktails, can bombs and grenades were used to keep people indoors while public address systems ordered the CISF men to surrender. 

 The Maoists were after the cache of assault rifles delivered to the camp a few weeks ago. But the consignment had been removed and the Naxalites failed to lay their hands on it. 

 Police today found a rifle, a mobile phone and cartridges left behind by the Naxalites. 

 A landmine was used to blow up the Pilpilo bridge around 8 pm yesterday. The deafening sound was the signal for the attack to commence. 

 A tree was felled to block the road at Kanjkiro and landmines were laid on the Gandhinagar highway. The rebels poured diesel and grease along the road. 

 The Maoists were led by six zonal commanders, including three young women. 

 The civilians were shot dead when the truck and the dumpers they were travelling in did not obey the Naxalites command to stop. All the three vehicles skidded on grease and came to a halt before the cowering civilians were dragged out and shot. 

 The additional home secretary of the Union government, Vinay Kumar, promised all help to Jharkhand to fight the rebels.

 Whale or cod oil, miracle sells

 New Delhi, March 28: Standing on the sidewalk of a busy office area in central Delhi, Mohammed Shaidul Islam dips his hand into a bottle containing a greenish liquid, and then bends over to massage a customers aching ankle.

 The rub-down over, he offers him a button-sized, disc-shaped fish bone as a long-term remedy. The bone, he explains, has to be tied tight to the part of the body that is in pain.

 Scooterists, cyclists, auto-rickshaw drivers and their curious passengers, apart from pedestrians, form his motley clientele, but Shaidul is no ordinary masseur. 

 Hes a fourth-generation peddler from a village in Bengals Murshidabad district who has travelled across India and Nepal, selling what he claims are bones and oil extracted from the mighty whales of the Indian Ocean.

 But before the alarm bells start ringing at the International Moratorium on Whaling, Shaidul clarifies these are actually remnants of cod fish.

 People wont know cod fish here. So we tell them that we are selling whale bones and oil, said his 18-year-old nephew Mohammed Amir Sheikh.

 Some two dozen customers hear him spill the truth, but that does not take away their faith. They turn their attention back to Shaidul and his business is safe.

 The duo hails from Jangipur village in Murshidabad, where, they say, almost all of the roughly 2,000 families have been peddling cod products in city squares for generations. Its what our forefathers have always done, smiled Amir.

 He started at the age of 10 soon after failing his Class IV examinations and can flaunt business cards received from customers from Mumbai, Calcutta, Delhi and Bangalore in India, and even Kathmandu and Pokhara in Nepal. 

 quot;Weve also done good business in smaller towns like Jamalpur (in Bihar) and Muzaffarabad (Uttar Pradesh), Amir said.

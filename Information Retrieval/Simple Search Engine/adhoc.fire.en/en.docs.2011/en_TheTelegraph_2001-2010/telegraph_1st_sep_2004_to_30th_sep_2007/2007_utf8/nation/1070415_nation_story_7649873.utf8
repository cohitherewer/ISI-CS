 Ripples at home over Uma pullout

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhopal, April 14: BJP leaders in Uttar Pradesh may be elated over the prospect of Uma Bhartis homecoming, but in her home state Madhya Pradesh, it is thumbs down for the sadhvi.

 Yesterday, Uma said she would withdraw all her partys candidates from the Uttar Pradesh elections to prevent a split in the BJPs votes.

 Both the BJP and the Congress in Madhya Pradesh appeared worked up over Uma today, though for different reasons.

 Senior ministers in the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government looked lost for words. 

 Most ministers who used to flaunt their proximity to Uma severed all links with her in November 2005 when she was expelled from the BJP. 

 A minister, who did not wish to be named, said: Didi agar aayi to hum gaye (If she comes, we will have to go out). Another leader said: She has a reputation for settling scores.

 The Congress, too, sounded worried. While AICC functionary Digvijay Singh put on a brave face saying Umas return would not make a difference in the state, senior party leaders conceded off the record that her homecoming would upset their calculations.

 In the past year, a defunct state Congress has been counting on a triangular contest, with Uma acting as spoiler and shoring up the partys prospects in the 2008 Assembly elections. Now, if she comes, she will be adding votes instead of cutting them, a state leader said.

 Chief minister Chauhan did not comment on Umas gesture but sources said he would not favour her immediate return to the BJP.

 Stephens quota revamp

 New Delhi, June 13 (PTI): St Stephens College today announced a new reservation formula for Christians and the introduction of a separate quota for Dalit Christians.

 Forty per cent seats in the college will now be reserved for Christian students as against the earlier 32 per cent, and 25 per cent of these will be set aside for Dalit Christians, principal Rev. Walson Thampu said today.

 Ten per cent of the total 400 seats will now be effectively reserved for Dalit Christians according to the formula that will be implemented from the next academic session.

 The quest for social justice prompted the college to have the reservation system in place. Besides, the bulk of the Christians in north India belong to the Dalit community and they can now take advantage of the facility, Thampu said.

 Fifteen per cent seats will be reserved for SCs, STs, differently abled students and children of defence personnel.

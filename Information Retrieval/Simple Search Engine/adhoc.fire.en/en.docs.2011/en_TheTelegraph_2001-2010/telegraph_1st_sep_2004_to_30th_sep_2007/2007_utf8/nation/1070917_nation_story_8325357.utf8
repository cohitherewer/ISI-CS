 US nudges, nuclear chief silent

 Vienna, Sept. 16 (PTI): The US today said it was important for India to negotiate a safeguards agreement with the IAEA even as atomic energy commission chief Anil Kakodkar refused to say whether he would hold talks with the nuclear watchdog.

 I will not speak anything on it now, Kakodkar, who arrived here today for the annual meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said at the IAEA headquarters.

 Finalising an India-specific safeguards agreement is one of the key steps for operationalising the deal, which has been mired in controversy.

 While Kakodkar remained tight-lipped, US energy secretary Samuel Bodman nudged India to fulfil its obligations under the nuclear cooperation agreement. It is important that both India and the US complete these processes by working with the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

 The comment came in response to a query on whether India can become a party to global nuclear energy partnership (GNEP) when it develops a dedicated facility for reprocessing fuel under the deal.

 We are looking forward to working with India, Bodman said. India has a lot of contribution in the development of technologies required under the GNEP and if they desire to join, we appreciate and will be successful in accommodating India. 

 India did not participate in the GNEP meet where 38 countries were represented.

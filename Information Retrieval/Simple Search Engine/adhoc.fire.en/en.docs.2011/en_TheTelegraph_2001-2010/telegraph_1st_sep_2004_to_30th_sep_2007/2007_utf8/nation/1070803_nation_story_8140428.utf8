 Doctor fears for visa

 Aug. 2 (Agencies): After Mohammed Haneef, his friend and colleague Mohammed Asif Ali fears losing his Australian work visa.

 Questioned by police last month over his relationship with Haneef but let off without charge, the doctor was suspended from his job last week over discrepancies in his employment history.

 Ali admitted forging some extra months of work history to gain employment in the UK, from where he had moved to Australia. I have regrets. I shouldnt have done it basically; I shouldnt have done that.

 He has been given 21 days to respond to a show-cause notice. 

 But he denied any involvement with any terrorist organisation and said he had never raised the issue with Haneef, against whom terror charges were dropped last week but whose visa remains cancelled.

 We are just normal friends, professional friends looking for a good life, a good career, he said. I have no other intentions apart from just working, just leading a peaceful life, theres nothing else I wanted from Australia.

 After police commissioner Mick Keelty said Ali remained a person of interest, the doctor fears his work visa might be cancelled. Im scared that something might happen in the future. They might take my visa at any time basically.

 Haneef dossier

 Media reports in Australia said leaked intelligence documents showed Haneef was regularly in contact with Islamic radicals under surveillance by British spy agency MI5.

 The doctor made contact using medical chat rooms, international phone cards and phone boxes, according to the documents. 

 Haneefs lawyers have asked for the full dossier to be made public. Every day there are new leaks and claims that can only come from official sources, his lawyer Peter Russo said. 

 The leaked dossier alleges he spoke to suspects about a project and a purpose before the failed UK bombings. 

 In Bangalore, deputy police commissioner Gopal Hosur rejected a media report that an Indian police file said Haneef had alleged links with al Qaida. That is all incorrect and false, Hosur said.

 Married mud on Modi

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 8: A Gujarat BJP rebel has begun digging up dirt about Narendra Modis family with infighting in the broken BJP house peaking three months to the elections.

 Somabhai Patel yesterday claimed that the chief minister hid his marriage he left the spouse column blank in an information booklet put out by the Gujarat legislature secretariat in 2005.

 It is a well-known fact that Modi has a wife who is a school teacher. And we know that he has not divorced her. So why hide it? Patel asked yesterday.

 The allegation comes at a time Modi is hemmed in by dissidents in the party unit. So bitter is the infighting that personal attacks, once taboo in Indian politics, are no longer out of bounds for dirty tricks departments.

 Modi has always claimed that he is a bachelor on the odd occasion that he has broken his silence on his marital status. Being single is a condition for being an RSS pracharak, which he was in the early nineties.

 However, his detractors have been claiming that Modi was wedded to a primary school teacher in Unja in Mehsana district of north Gujarat. He was apparently married off in his teens, much before he joined the RSS.

 Patel yesterday raked up the marriage in the context of womens empowerment. He questioned how Modi could be committed to the cause, given that he had deserted his wife and concealed his marriage.

 A womens rights group today fanned the fire, dubbing the chief minister a hypocrite and vowing to expose his duplicity. One who does not acknowledge his own wife, how can he champion the cause of women? asked Ila Pathak, the head of the Ahmedabad Womens Action Group.

 This is the first time in his five-year tenure that the chief minister has faced such a below-the-belt attack. 

 Sources said the Modi issue had reached Delhi BJP circles with national party president Rajnath Singh summoning Gujarat unit chief Purushottam Rupala yesterday. Rupala said the high command was assessing the matter. 

 There was no official reaction from Modi but Gujarat BJP spokesperson Vijay Rupani said: It only shows their (the rebels) mentality. They have nothing substantial to say against the chief minister, so they are stooping low and talking about a dead issue.

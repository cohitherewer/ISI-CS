 Speeding Daler in tinted trouble

 Tinted glass on your car windows can work against you, as Daler Mehndi found out recently. Delhi traffic cops prowling the streets for violators of tightened traffic laws implemented from last week stopped a sports utility vehicle cruising down Rajpath with tinted glass windows. 

 The police were about to book the driver, when Daler and his friends popped out. The Punjabi pop star told them he wasnt from Delhi and had no way of knowing the new rules the high court has banned tinted glass windows except in cases where the occupant has a certificate validating his need for privacy. 

 The car had a Delhi registration. It was also speeding more than the permitted 50 kmph, said sub-inspector Gajinder Singh. Daler, in Delhi to perform in a concert at Rashtrapati Bhavan, may have got away if it was only speeding. But the windows slammed the door on that chance. Any constable who sees Daler might be slightly lenient, Singh said.

 Students in power play

 As a dark summer looms on Mumbai, some bright minds at D.G Ruparel College at Matunga have decided to help the city conserve power.

 At least 35 students will launch a campaign telling households about ways to save electricity that, too, as part of their academic project.

 Students who have been pursuing the minimum comparative vocational course will offer suggestions on how the use of electricity can be minimised by using electronic appliances the right way. 

 Each student will visit a house every day and tell families about ways to conserve electricity. Data on how appliances affect monthly billing patterns will also be collected, said V. Godbole, the professor who is overseeing the project. 

 A month later, the same families will be asked if the tips are working. The difference in the bills for the two months will prove if the students have succeeded in their mission.

 Resort train chugs along

 The Darjeeling toy train isnt the only one of its kind that the railways take pride in. 

 On Sunday, Matheran, a popular hill resort 100 km from Mumbai, celebrated the centenary of its own light train. The service starts from Neral at the base of the hill.

 Minister of state for railways Naranbhai Rathwa, who presided over the programme, inaugurated an exhibition on the link and promised a rail museum at the site. He said bigger trains will be run on the route once work on the hill tunnels is started.

 Railway officials reminisced about the days when Matheran link was built by Sir Aadamjee Peerbhoy. Hussain Peerbhoy, His grand- son and his family were felicitated by Rathwa at the event. India Posts released a series of memorabilia to mark the occasion. 

 Soft landing

 The cloud of a Centre-state spat over the makeover of the Chennai airport appears to be lifting. Recently, the state sent the central government a plan under which 700-800 acres can be acquired for a second runway.

 A technical team of the civil aviation ministry will vet the proposal before a final decision is taken.

 The new runway at the Meenambakkam airport is to be laid on the other side of the Adyar river. A new terminal is also coming up.

 The state wants a new airport and had shortlisted two sites one at Oragadam and the other near Sriperumbudur. But the Centre shot down the idea saying it wouldnt be viable.

 Chennai: Lovers of Carnatic music have an evening to look forward to. Papanasam Ashok Ramani will give a concert at the Youth Hostel in Adyar. The show is on April 18. The venue is near Second Avenue, Indira Nagar. The show begins at 6.30 pm.

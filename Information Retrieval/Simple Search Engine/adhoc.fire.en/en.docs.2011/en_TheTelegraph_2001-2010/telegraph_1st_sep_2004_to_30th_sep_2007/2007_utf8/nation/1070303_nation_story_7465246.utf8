 72-yr-old fined for contempt

 New Delhi, March 2 (PTI): A 70-year-old woman has been fined Rs 35,000 for contempt of court for defying two undertakings she had given Delhi High Court.

 Savithri Goenka had promised court she would vacate the flat of a person called M. Bhalla, located at Hailey Road here. The court had last week asked her to pay for causing unnecessary delay in complying with the undertakings.

 The court fails to appreciate the conduct of Savitri Goenka in remaining defiant in not complying with the undertakings given by her by way of affidavits on two occasions, Justice S. Murlidhar said.

 The fact that Goenka is a 70-year-old lady cannot possibly excuse her from complying with the solemn undertaking given by her to this court, the court said.

 The order came after Goenka failed to appear in person before the court on a contempt petition filed by Bhalla.

 Goenka had, in two separate affidavits in December 2003 and in January 2004, stated she would vacate the flat.

 However, when she did not vacate it in spite of her promise, Bhalla moved a contempt petition before the court.

 Karat call to arms in judiciary battle

 New Delhi, March 30: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat has urged the Centre to open talks with all national parties to meet the challenge of judicial intervention.

 The Prime Minister must consult all political parties in order to work out measures to meet the judicial challenge, Karat said after inaugurating a convention organised by his party on the Sachar committee report here today.

 The CPM leader was referring to the Supreme Court stay on the 27 per cent OBC quota in central institutions of higher education. 

 We should be able to meet the challenge (from the judiciary) squarely, he said. He indicated that court orders were impeding the access to education for a majority of people at a time when loss of state control over private institutions meant millions were shut out.

 Karat warned of the threats posed by the judiciary to some of the CPMs key demands. The party, for instance, wants OBCs among Muslims to be entitled to reservation. 

 It has also sought quotas for Dalit Muslims, though human resource development minister Arjun Singh has ruled out the idea. 

 There is no provision for religion-based quotas in the Constitution. But we can see how to include Muslim OBCs in the official list, Singh had said at a conference earlier this month.

 The CPM has prepared a charter of suggestions to improve the educational and economic status of Muslims after the Sachar report highlighted their relative lack of progress. 

 The final list will be drawn up after feedback from the delegates who attended todays convention.

 Karat cited the Supreme Courts judgment in the Inamdar case that struck down reservations even in institutions run by states. It is a double blow to the disadvantaged sections. 

 The CPM is of the view that affirmative action is a must to improve the condition of Muslims, but Karat said court interventions in legislative procedures were casting a shadow on its prerogative. 

 We dont want the Sachar report to be just another document. The UPA government must act on it, he said. 

 The report had shown that the Muslims were not doing well even in Left-ruled states such as Bengal. Karat didnt explain why this was the case, but only said Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has asked the Planning Commission to create a sub-plan for Muslims, similar to the one it prepares for tribals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Officer sorry

 Calcutta, March 21: Land reforms commissioner P.K. Agarwal had to apologise to the deputy secretary in the commerce and industry department, Jiban Chakraborty, this evening for throwing him out of his chamber during a meeting in the morning.

 The meeting, in Agarwals chamber, had been called to discuss a state-wide census on small tea-growers in Bengal. Agarwal was reportedly miffed when he saw that commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen had not turned up but sent a junior officer instead.

 A war of words erupted after which Agarwal asked Chakraborty to get out.

 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Time to call it a day, governor

 Gubernatorial posts are meant to offer out-of-work politicians cosy sanctuaries. But for some, like S.M. Krishna, the realisation dawns a little too late in the day.

 The Maharashtra governor may retire from active politics after three years of efforts to get back into the limelight.

 Pushing 75, the former Karnataka chief minister till recently nurtured hopes of leading the Congress pack in his home state and used to divide time equally between Bangalore and Mumbai. On his numerous visits, he would spend much of his time sermonising on Karnataka politics and suggesting the way ahead for the Congress. 

 Recently, though, there were some signs of a change of mind. It is time for seniors to make way for the second-rung leaders in Karnataka. It is inevitable, Krishna told the gathering at the inauguration of a hospital. 

 Finally, many felt they had heard the swansong as the suave politician, known for his sartorial sense and trademark wig, appears to get ready to ride into the sunset.

 Brakes on fast cop

 With a declared salary of Rs 20,000 a month, Vipin Kumar owned two massive bungalows, three fancy cars, six firearms and had lakhs stashed away in bank lockers. 

 Thanks to the power of his uniform, and his shrewd business sense.

 The CBI arrested Kumar, a Delhi police sub-inspector, just as he was haggling for a bribe with a man accused of stealing a car. The officer had initially asked the accused to cough up Rs 2 lakh for his freedom, but finally settled for a more modest Rs 25,000.

 Ironically, Kumar is the one who now finds himself behind bars.

 The CBI believes Kumars three cars a Hyundai Santro, a Maruti Zen Estillo and a Toyota Corolla could well be stolen vehicles. The six firearms, apart from his service revolver, are also illegal. The joyride is over for Kumar. 

 Swayamvar on the web

 Looking for your soulmate? Log on to the Internet, not to search for a life partner but to tie the knot right away.

 Bharat Matrimony, a marriage portal based in Chennai, is organising an online swayamvaram (mass marriage event) that will cut through geographical barriers.

 According to Muruguvel Janaakiraman, the founder and CEO of the portal, this will be the first such on-line rendezvous. The first community to benefit from the move will be the Agarwals. 

 The unique interface will be extended to other groups across the country gradually.

 To participate, one must be a registered member of the portal. 

 While the site has community-based search options, its officials say online swayamvarams will soon be lined up for youngsters who do not have any special preference for finding a partner in their own group.

 Bus block

 According to court orders, the brakes will be slammed on the blood-spilling Bluelines, but the road ahead is uncertain.

 The Delhi government, asked to take the buses off the streets by 2012, told Delhi High Court recently that its own fleet of DTC buses will not be enough to meet the requirement.

 Transport minister Haroon Yusuf said the government could ask the court to delay the withdrawal. 

 The court wants the government and the state-run DTC to purchase 3,000 buses in three months so that the Bluelines can be phased out within the deadline.

 Delhi: Watch Krishna, a dance-drama on the life of the Lord, at Kamani Auditorium this Tuesday at 3pm. The event is organised by the Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra. The venue is next to Mandi House, accessible by the Metro. Tickets for Rs 500, 300, 200 and Rs 100.

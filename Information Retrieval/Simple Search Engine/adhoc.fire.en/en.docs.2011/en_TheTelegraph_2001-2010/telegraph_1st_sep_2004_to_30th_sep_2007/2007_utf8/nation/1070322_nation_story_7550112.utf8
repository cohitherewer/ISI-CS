 Top court to settle CBI probe tussle

 New Delhi, March 21: A Constitution bench of the Sup-reme Court will decide whe-ther courts can order a CBI probe into incidents like the Nandigram firing without the consent of the state government.

 A three-judge bench headed by Justice B.N. Agrawal today referred to a larger be-nch a Bengal government petition challenging a Calcutta High Court order of a CBI inquiry into the alleged killing of 11 Trinamul Congress sympathisers at Chhoto Angaria village in 2001.

 Last Thursday, the high court ordered another CBI inquiry on the police firing in Nandigram the previous day. A high court lawyer, Kalyan Bandhyopadhyay, has filed a caveat to pre-empt the state government from obtaining a stay on the probe without opposition.

 While Bengal has not made any announcement, that a caveat has been filed suggests the petitioner is afraid the state will oppose the CBI probe into the firing. A caveat is filed to ensure the court does not pass an order without hearing the petitioner. 

 The high court had acted on its own in ordering the Nandigram inquiry, but the CBI probe into the Chhoto Angaria killings allegedly by CPM workers was ordered on a public interest litigation by the Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights. Bandhyopadhyay is a lawyer for the committee.

 The government filed an appeal against the March 30 order on April 7, 2001. The state said the court should not have directed a CBI investigation as it had already been handed over to the CID. It further argued that the order was in conflict with other legal provisions. 

 Although the appeal was pending, the apex court had not stayed the CBI inquiry.

 The bench headed by Justice Agrawal felt that the question of law had to be settled by a Constitution bench. Such matters had been coming before the court frequently. 

 In 1995, a three-judge be-nch of the apex court in the Sampta Lal case, about the death of two boys in Bengal, had upheld the power of co-urts to order a CBI probe without the consent of the state. 

 The bench headed by Justice Agrawal had the option of following the precedent but could not review the decision.

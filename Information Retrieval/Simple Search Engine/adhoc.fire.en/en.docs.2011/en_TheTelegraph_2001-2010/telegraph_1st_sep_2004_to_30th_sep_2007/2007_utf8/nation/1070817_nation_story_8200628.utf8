 Mumbai, Aug. 16: Customers have started besieging Nokia stores across the country and firing in emails after the cellphone maker announced a worldwide product recall of 46 million batteries on Tuesday.

 The BL-5C model batteries were made by Matsushita, the Japanese electronics giant, between December 2005 and November 2006. The recall was announced after reports that about a hundred of them had overheated on recharge.

 We have had people queuing up since morning today to enquire about their batteries. Over 200 people came, but there have been just two cases of defective batteries so far. But we are not sure if those two purchased original batteries, said the manager of the Nokia Priority Shop at Marine Lines in Mumbai.

 What has complicated the problem is that Nokias cellphones, which have 49 per cent market share in India, are widely sold in the grey market. It is very difficult to guess whether the customer has an original Nokia battery or not, said a company official.

 Any Nokia customer in India can approach us in three ways, said Devinder Kishore, director, marketing, Nokia India. The customer can send us an SMS to 5555 after typing in BT followed by space with the 26-digit code on the battery. He can also call us at 080-30303838 or log on to our website, www.nokia.co.in. 

 In the two days after the issue of the advisory, Kishore said the companys website received about 20,000 hits. We have received close to 1.45 lakh SMSes till 12.30pm today and approximately 4 to 5 per cent of these are suspect batteries, he said.

 We have already updated our dealers. As soon as we receive an SMS, we tell the customer whether the battery is defective or not. If it is, we ask for the customers postal address and courier a new battery across, said a Nokia official.

 We expect the customer to get the replacement battery from Nokia within 10 days.

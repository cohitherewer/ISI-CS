 Wiser, Saif shuns puff

 Mumbai, Feb. 26: Barely a week since stories of his illness swamped the print and electronic media, Saif Ali Khan is back on his feet.

 Theres bad news and good news, says Saif. The bad news is that it was a blood clot in my heart. The good news is that its been fully cured. The cardiologist came on Saturday morning to take my ECG test and it was all clear.

 Saif left Lilavati Hospital yesterday. But Ill have to take it easy for a while. Nothing strenuous and certainly no smoking any more. In fact, my doctors told me my condition was brought on entirely by smoking. It causes deposits in the artery, which caused that clot. Ive decided to quit smoking completely.

 Today Saif and his heart have become the best of friends. Yeah, you can say that again. Its been a time of revelation for me. Though I came out unscathed, this hospital experience served up a healthy warning for me. 

 I need to correct a few things in my life, mainly the smoking. There I was, with genuinely ill people, people who were suffering from cancer and chronic heart ailments. It just made me so conscious of my own life and my responsibilities.

 The ceaseless surge of concern has moved Saif. I was so glad to see my family and so many of my friends from the film industry visiting me in hospital. I now intend to use my rest period writing each of them a personal thank you note.

 So has the experience made Saif more compassionate? I guess so. I never visited anyone in hospital. Now Ive decided to change that. It matters so much to have people who care for you when youre down.

 Saifs one immediate regret: I couldnt host the Filmfare Awards. In fact, it would take me a couple of weeks to get back to normal.

 BJP sees stain that will not wash

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The controversial Ram Setu affidavit has been withdrawn but the BJP is convinced the gains from the controversy will stay with it.

 The BJP leaders said the Congress would not be able to wash the stain for a long time or go ahead with the planned Sethusamudram project in a way that harms the Ram Setu.

 They said the Centres request for more time in court to explore alternative routes showed the problems it was facing after the uproar caused by the affidavit, which said there was no proof Lord Ram ever lived.

 The dominant view was that the Centre had come under pressure to review the Sethusamudram plan. 

 Apart from bringing the issue into sharp national focus, the governments intentions have come under suspicion. There is more pressure on the Centre to change the alignment, a senior BJP leader said. 

 General secretary Arun Jaitley echoed him, saying the setus destruction would now come at a heavy political cost. There was no way the Centre could go ahead with the plan, which was not desirable on economic, environmental or religious grounds, Jaitley said. 

 The government, he said, had finally understood the power of nationalist sentiments after trampling on majority views for three years.

 The BJP leaders felt the problems began much before the setu row. They were of the view that the Centres move to accept the proposals of the Sachar Committee, which went into the reasons for the lack of development among Muslims, led to a pro-Muslim bias in policies. 

 This would make it easier for the BJP to convince people about the anti-Hindu mindset of the secular UPA regime, they said.

 This (the setu row) will stick on the Congress. The message is out and the withdrawal of the affidavit has only a technical significance, the BJP leader said.

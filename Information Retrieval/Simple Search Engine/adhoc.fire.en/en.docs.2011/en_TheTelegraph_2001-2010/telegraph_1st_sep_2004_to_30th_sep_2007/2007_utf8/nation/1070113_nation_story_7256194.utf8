 Afzal at Kalam mercy

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 Afzal

 New Delhi, Jan. 12: Mohammad Afzal today exhausted his last judicial option to cheat the hangman when the Supreme Court dismissed his petition that claimed he had been denied a fair trial.

 The fate of the Parliament attack plotter now lies entirely in the hands of the executive, which has the power to grant a pardon. If the President, who formally heads the executive, rejects Afzals mercy petition, he will be hanged.

 With the matter now out of the courts, the government cannot cite any legal hurdle to a decision on the mercy petition. But the President, who is bound to act on the governments advice, does not face a deadline.

 The apex court, however, had in an earlier case held that an execution after an unreasonable delay violated the convicts right to life, and in such instances the death sentence should be commuted to a life term. So, if his hanging is put off far too long, Afzal will have the right to approach the apex court again. But how much delay is unreasonable is to be decided case by case.

 Afzal had first sought a review after the Supreme Court upheld his death sentence, passed by the trial court and confirmed by Delhi High Court. But the apex court didnt find anything wrong in its earlier ruling.

 He then played his last judicial card, moving a curative petition a provision devised by the Supreme Court itself, in a 2002 judgment, to cure a gross miscarriage of justice.

 One can invoke this extraordinary jurisdiction of the apex court only if a designated senior advocate certifies that a court order had violated a settled law. Afzal had argued that the court had ignored the fact that he was not defended by a competent lawyer and, therefore, did not have a fair trial.

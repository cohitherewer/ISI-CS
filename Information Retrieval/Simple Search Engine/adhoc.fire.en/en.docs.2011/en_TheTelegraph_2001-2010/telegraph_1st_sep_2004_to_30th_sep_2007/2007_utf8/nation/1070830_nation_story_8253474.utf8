 Turf tussle tells on AIIMS

 New Delhi, Aug. 29: The scream of protest from Suraj Sharma, a young doctor, drowned out the sob of Ratnaben Patel as she was turned away from the outpatients department at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

 Suraj, 23, wants his MBBS degree from AIIMS immediately to fulfil his ambition of studying at the Harvard Medical School this year. Ratnaben, a resident of Anjar in Gujarat, is desperate for an endoscopy. Both are victims of the latest round of a cold war between the AIIMS administration and the health ministry. 

 The striking doctors ensured that all departments, other than the casualty wards, remained closed today, while the hospital administration and the government traded charges over a delay in handing out degrees to students.

 Health minister Anbumani Ramadoss and AIIMS director P. Venugopal decided to distribute the degrees on September 25 after a meeting this evening. By then, though, thousands of patients like Ratnaben had left, unattended. 

 The scene is likely to be the same tomorrow as talks to break the stalemate failed late tonight amid signs that the doctors could move court to get their degrees quickly. It takes almost two years for the degrees to be given. This year, it has taken unusually long because the health minister refuses to sign, said AIIMS Resident Doctors Association president Kumar Harsh.

 In a letter written to Venugopal last night, Ramadoss said he could not sign the degrees as they were illegal. The documents were signed by Dr Sandeep Aggarwal, a registrar appointed by Venugopal in violation of the AIIMS act, the minister said. 

 Under the AIIMS act, the institutes governing body, not the director, appoints the registrar. Aggarwal has already been removed and the governing body has reinstated Dr V.P. Gupta, one of Aggarwals predecessors. The minister said in the letter that the onus of rectifying the degrees was on Venugopal.

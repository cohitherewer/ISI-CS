 Bangalore, July 4: Dr Zakia Ahmed stoutly defended her younger son Sabeel, one of the seven doctors being held in connection with the UK terror plot, but what stood out was her silence on her first-born, Khaleel, who too she said had been questioned.

 Khaleel, a doctor who followed his younger brother to the UK and drove a taxi part-time, has not been named in any British media report. 

 I spoke to Sabeel yesterday after his arrest for less than two minutes. He called from a different number. Since it was a UK number, I picked it up. He told me he was safe and that everything was all right, said the mother, a respected physician who used to teach at Bangalore Medical College.

 Zakia did not ask her son why he was arrested she already knew, having telephoned Sabeels friends when he didnt make his daily call home on Saturday.

 But she did ask him if he was involved. Everything is fine. I will be back soon, is what he told her.

 A police spokesperson in London said Sabeel would be questioned till Saturday, when a decision will be taken on whether to charge him.

 I have talked to his friends and solicitors who have told me there is nothing much (in the case against him) Zakia said.

 She said she used to speak to Sabeel every day since he left India. He went to Portugal just last month to present a paper. He was always studious and serious.

 Sabeel is doing his MD in surgery at the Warrington hospital in the Liverpool area, from where he was arrested soon after the thwarted car bomb attack on the Glasgow airport. 

 Zakia and her husband, Dr Maqbool Ahmed, who, too, has retired from Bangalore Medical College, were looking for a bride for the 26-year-old who graduated in 2003 from the Dr B.R. Ambedkar Medical College and Hospital the same institute where Mohammed Haneef, the suspect detained in Brisbane, had studied.

 The family knew Haneef very well, Zakia said, as Maqbool sat quietly in their single-storey home. He was Sabeels senior and used to come home often. They are very close friends, especially after moving to the UK.

 A PTI report said the families are related.

 Sabeel left for the UK in 2005 to do his MD. Khaleel left a year later, Zakia said.

 Khaleel, who is two years older than Sabeel and is married, was picked up late on Tuesday night when he was driving a taxi, she added.

 But the Ahmeds would not give away any more about Khaleel. His wife was not with him, but nothing more is known about her.

 Ambedkar college principal Dr B.R. Ramesh said: Sabeel was an average student and took six more months to finish the course as he had failed in one paper. He had been admitted to the college on a payment category seat, he added.

 Sabeel was outgoing and friendly. He was good in sports and participated in extra-curricular activities. He passed out in 2003 and also did his internship here till 2004.

 Ramesh added that the college would continue to believe its former students were innocent unless proved otherwise.

 Haneef wife

 Haneefs wife Firdous insisted today her husband is innocent. Its just that his SIM card and Net connection were used by one of the suspects. Asked how she knew that, she had no answer. 

 An engineering graduate, she had recently returned from Brisbane to deliver a baby girl. Standing inside the door of her parents house, she said: He was coming to see his daughter who was born on June 26.

 Firdous, whose father Ishtiaq Ahmed is an Airports Authority of India contractor who runs the two parking lots at the Bangalore airport, could not say why her husband had bought a one-way ticket when he was only coming home for a short holiday. 

 She said she had not spoken to Haneef after he was detained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Beeline for reborn cleric

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 1: 

 Politicians in Kerala hailed Abdul Nasser Madhani as a martyr 

 after his release but cautioned him against going back to 

 the extremist politics the fire-breathing cleric was once 

 associated with.

 In the bipolar Kerala politics, ranged between the ruling Left coalition and the Congress-led Opposition, Madhanis electoral appeal remains inscrutable. 

 But rival front leaders are leaving nothing to chance as they line up for the massive civic reception being organised by the Peoples Democratic Party for its chairman on a beach here tomorrow evening.

 The anxiety of the Left Front was evident in a CPI ministers rush to the ancestral house of Madhani in the southern Kollam district this morning to share the good news with his parents. Ironically, it was a Left Front government that had turned him over to Tamil Nadu police in 1998.

 Caution came from chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan, who said: Its a tremendous relief that Madhani had been exonerated but he should work towards building a secular democratic India.

 More forthright was Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) state president Panakkad Mohammed Ali Shihab Thangal: He had come into politics espousing extremism which we abhor. But we welcome his release since his days of unjust incarceration are over.

 The League will be keeping a wary eye on Madhani, though the dissident space has already been occupied by another group.

 In the first flush of freedom, Madhani sent moderate signals. 

 If at all there have been any lapses in my previous conduct, Ill rectify them. I will work for the welfare of all people, especially the downtrodden. Ill adhere to secularism, he said.

 Back in the nineties, Madhani was a small-time cleric who aroused Muslim youths to frenzy at post-prayer public meetings, attacking the saffron brand of politics and berating the League leadership for deceiving the community for the sake of power.

 Madhani later set up the Islamic Sevak Sangh as a counter to what he described as the militant, fascist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). He lost one of his legs in a bomb attack blamed on the RSS, following which his popularity soared and his influence spread to pockets in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

 But Madhani had ended up a pawn in the hands of fringe groups that were ranged against the moderate League. The radicals left him in the lurch after he was picked up by Kerala police in 1998 in connection with an alleged communal speech.

 Nine years later, Madhanis release is a defining moment both for him and the state: it gives him the benefit of long years of introspection to abjure the politics of communal hate and emerge as a mainstream politician.

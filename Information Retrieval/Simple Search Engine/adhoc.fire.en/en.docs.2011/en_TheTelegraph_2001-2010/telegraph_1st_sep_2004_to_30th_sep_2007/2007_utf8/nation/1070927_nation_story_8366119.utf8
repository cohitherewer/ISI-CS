 Mumbai, Sept. 26: India, India, the 35,000-strong crowd chanted in unison.

 The stadium roared approval when a local orchestra belted out the number Sabse aage honge Hindustani.

 Then, as the open-top bus rolled into the BCCI headquarters next door with the winning team, Chale chalo from Lagaan and the nations new anthem Chak de, Chak de India had Wankhede on its feet. 

 Nationalism ruled.

 Its a proud moment for the country. Cricket is a religion for us. It binds us together. They have retained the pride of the country and its no mean task. I would never in my dreams greet politicians in a similar fashion. You cant equate this nationalist fervour with any other event, said 15-year old Pratyay Ubale, vice-captain of the cricket team of GD Somani Memorial School.

 Politician R.R. Patil did try though, equating the T20 World Cup win with war. They played like warriors and snatched the cup from Pakistan, the deputy chief minister said. 

 Not everyone had war on their minds some were thinking of the last World Cup win. Its a historic moment. India was outstanding and this victory is awe-inspiring because we waited for it for 24 years, said businessman, Kunal Sharma, who was 19 when Kapil Devs team brought home the Cup. 

 If Yuvraj Singh had grabbed a Tricolour from a fan during the victory lap on Monday and Harbhajan Singh had wrapped himself in one today, most schoolchildren waiting at the stadium had the national flag painted on their cheeks and waved one in their hands. 

 I have been to this ground before, but I have never seen so many youngsters here. Its a nice feeling to see this generation feels this way about the game. If something brings us together, its cricket, said Dinesh Ahuja, a schoolteacher.

 The fans went into a frenzy as Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his team began their victory lap. Hundreds of fans seated in Divecha Pavilion next to the stage broke through the barricades and poured into the ground.

 This team is truly Team India. Each one of us finds a place here its well represented. Its truly India, said Ehetesham Haq, wearing a Tricolour kurta and waving the Indian flag.

 Close shave for IITs

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, March 29: The Indian Institutes of Technology will have an easier time than the management schools.

 The IIT admission forms this year did not ask for OBC identification. The plan was to ask OBC students to tick a box on the examination scripts at the Joint Entrance Examination, scheduled for April 8. Now all we have to do is scrap the box, said an IIT Kanpur administrator. 

 Will the IITs push for an increase in seats this year? IIT Delhi officials say they are unlikely to do so, unless the Centre gives the funds it promised for the quota implementation. 

 If the Centre now refuses to release the money, it would be impossible to increase the seats. We do not, as of yet, have any plans to increase the fees, an IIT Delhi official said. 

 Vice-chancellors of other central universities like Delhi University and Jawaharlal Nehru University said the Supreme Court decision would give them more time to develop infrastructure, were the quota to be implemented in 2008-09.

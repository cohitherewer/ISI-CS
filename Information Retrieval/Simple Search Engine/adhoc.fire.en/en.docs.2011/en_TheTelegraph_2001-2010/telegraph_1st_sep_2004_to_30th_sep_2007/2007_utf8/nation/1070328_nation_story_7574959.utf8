 Govt portal on RTI misleading

 New Delhi, March 27 (PTI): The department of personnel and training, the nodal agency for instructions on the Right to Information Act, has been misleading government offices with its website saying file notings do not come under the laws ambit.

 The central information commission has made it clear that disclosure of file notings under the act can be made.

 The issue once again came up before the commission after the Presidents secretariat on an RTI application of S.S. Bhamra, an assistant there denied information pertaining to certain file notings, saying the website talks of non-disclosure of such file notings.

 We have earlier advised DoPT (the personnel department) to remove this misleading information.... We expect them to do so immediately if the result of this inclusion on their site has been to mislead even... the office of the President of India, said chief information commissioner Wajahat Habibullah.

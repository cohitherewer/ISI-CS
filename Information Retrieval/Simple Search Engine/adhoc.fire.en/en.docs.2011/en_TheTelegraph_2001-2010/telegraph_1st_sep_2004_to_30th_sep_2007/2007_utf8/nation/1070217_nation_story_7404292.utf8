 Interpol alert bid for 7/11 accused

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, Feb. 16: The anti-terrorist squad is trying to get Interpol red-corner notices issued against 11 absconders charged in last years attack on the citys local trains. 

 Nine of them are foreign nationals and two Raheel Sheikh and Rizwan Daware are Indians. Our first priority is to get Shaikh and Daware. We wanted to get notices issued against all at the same time, but since the process is time consuming, we have prioritised the list, said assistant commissioner of police Jai Jeet Singh of the anti-terrorist squad (ATS).

 The ATS has sent the necessary papers to the CBI, the nodal agency in the country for forwarding such requests to Interpol.

 On November 30, 2006, the ATS filed a 10,000-page chargesheet in the July 11 serial train blasts, naming 30 accused. Thirteen of them are in judicial custody and two are dead. Among the absconders, two are Indians, four Bangladeshis and nine Pakistanis.

 Since the blasts, Delhi and Islamabad have been contradicting each other over sharing of evidence on the role of the Pakistani nationals.

 We hope the Interpol red-corner notice will help, said ATS chief K.P. Raghuvanshi, refusing to be drawn into the question of evidence-sharing with Pakistan.

 The biggest hurdle for investigators right now is to decipher the source of funds used in the bomb blasts and investigations show that Sheikh and Daware can tell us that, he said. The other unsolved question is about the place from where the explosives were sourced.

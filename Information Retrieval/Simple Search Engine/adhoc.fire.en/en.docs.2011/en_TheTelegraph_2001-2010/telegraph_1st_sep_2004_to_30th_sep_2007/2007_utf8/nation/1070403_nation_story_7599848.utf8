 Court snubs Medha plea

 New Delhi, April 2 (PTI): The Supreme Court today declined to pass any order on a Narmada Bachao Andolan plea seeking to restrain a non-government organisation, which has filed a PIL accusing it of receiving foreign funds, from approaching the media.

 Why are you (NBA) bothered about press reports. You should just ignore them, a bench of Justices C.K. Thakker and Altamas Kabir told the Medha Patkar-led NBA.

 The organisation had objected to recent news reports related to the pending PIL filed by Ahmedabad-based NGO National Council for Civil Liberties. 

 The reports referred to affidavits filed before the apex court by the Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat governments, supporting the NGOs allegation that the NBA was creating political instability in India with foreign funds.

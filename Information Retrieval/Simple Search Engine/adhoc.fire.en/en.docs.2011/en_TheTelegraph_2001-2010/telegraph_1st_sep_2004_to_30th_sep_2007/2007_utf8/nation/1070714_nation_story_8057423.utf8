 Vietnam scourge on Nimitz heels 

 Kitty Hawk to anchor in Left backyard

 Nimitz Then 

 Kitty Hawk Now 

New Delhi, July 13: The USS Nimitz, the American nuclear-powered aircraft carrier that anchored off Chennai earlier this month and had the Left ranting against it, will be back in Indian waters in two months, this time in the company of another supercarrier, the USS Kitty Hawk. 

 If the Nimitz, as the CPMs Prakash Karat said, is the symbol of US aggression against Iraq and Afghanistan, the Kitty Hawk is a symbol of aggression against the Left. In the late-1960s, aircraft from the Kitty Hawk flew sorties over North Vietnam, bombing the Viet Cong, the Communist liberation warriors led by Ho Chi Minh who the Left in India supported so avidly. 

 Both the Nimitz and the Kitty Hawk will be in the Bay of Bengal for wargames hosted by India in the first week of September.

 Even more to the chagrin of those who dissent against India-US military relations, the two American vessels are to lead ships from five nations, including Indias flagship, the INS Viraat, in a wargame that will simulate the manoeuvres of carrier strike group. 

 Indian Navy sources have confirmed that the Nimitz will be back even as Lt General Jeffrey B. Kohler, director of the US Defence Security Cooperation Agency that promotes US military sales, is in Delhi, explaining to Indian defence officials the intricacies of American arms transfer processes. 

 This month, the Indian Air Force global tender for 126 multi-role combat aircraft will be issued. The F/A-18 Superhornet aircraft, a squadron of which is based in the Nimitz, is one of the contenders for the order that will run to more than $10 billion. 

 On board the Nimitz on July 1, the commander of the Nimitz-led Carrier Strike Group 11, Rear Admiral Terry Blake, had told The Telegraph that India-US naval coordination is now so advanced that the two navies are able to function in a strike group. 

 The last Malabar exercise demonstrated that, he said. But, he emphasised, these drills were to be practised regularly. It is important to keep at it, he said. 

 Indian Navy sources said the September drill will be in three dimensions meaning on the surface, underwater and in the air. Submarines and aircraft will simulate offensive and defensive manoeuvres along with nearly 20 ships. 

 The September exercises in which analysts see a nascent Asian Nato, an alliance against China are to be hosted by India. The defence ministry in Delhi denies any intention to advertise a posture that could be interpreted as hostile to China and points to the small but growing peaceful military confidence building measures with Beijing. 

 The September wargames will be held in the Bay of Bengal between Visakhapatnam and the Andamans. The drills would be in international waters (more than 12 nautical miles from the Indian coast). 

 So long, the Malabar series of exercises have been confined to exchanges between the Indian and the US navies, barring the embedded vessels of countries friendly to the US (read its coalition partners). But this is the first time India will participate in and host an exercise as large as this. 

 Naval headquarters sources in Delhi confirmed that the INS Viraat, which is usually based in Mumbai, would be deployed to the east coast for the wargames. The Viraat is the largest ship in the Indian fleet. 

 The Indian Navy is expecting 20 ships from the five countries Australia, Singapore, Japan and the US being the others for the exercise. This is going to be a fairly complex exercise, navy sources said. With the US, we have achieved through the Malabar series a high degree of inter operability. The Indian contingent will also include destroyers and cruisers. 

 If a comparable exercise with a US war machine in the lead were to be held on land, political dissent against it would be loudly voiced. But navies typically operate away from public view and the political fallout of their activity is usually limited. 

 The Malabar exercise due in September also points to the direction that naval exchanges are being guided to since the US chief of naval operation and advocate of a Thousand-Ship Navy, Admiral Michael G. Mullen, explained his concept of the dream maritime force to an approving Indian Navy and sought access to Indian ports for warships of such a fleet. 

 The issue of access in crucial to the US Navy that forward-deploys its ships far from home in the Asia-Pacific region and wants refuelling facilities, rest and recreation opportunities for its crew that run into thousands on each aircraft carrier, and for logistics support. 

 Unlike the Nimitz, the Kitty Hawk is not nuclear-powered. It is the oldest ship in the US fleet and is home-ported at Yokosuka, Japan. The Kitty Hawk is due to be decommissioned in 2009. The exercise with the Indian Navy will be one of its last active deployments before it sails to the US via Japan. 

 In April, an Indian flotilla participated in trilateral exercises off the coast of Japan with the US and Japanese navies.

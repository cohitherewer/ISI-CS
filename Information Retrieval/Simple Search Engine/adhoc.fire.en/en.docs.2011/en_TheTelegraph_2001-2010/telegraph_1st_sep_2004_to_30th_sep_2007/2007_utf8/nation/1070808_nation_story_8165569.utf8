 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Sting squadron at tech address

 The Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi isnt a preferred destination just for students. Mosquitoes, it appears, love the elite engineering school.

 IIT Delhi has been slapped a notice by the state governments health department for violating safety norms and allowing mosquitoes to proliferate on campus.

 The notice effectively serves as a warning to the engineering school if the government finds a violation of safety rules during a subsequent random check, the IIT could face legal action.

 They produce some of the countrys future leaders, but they seem incompetent in dealing with these tiny-winged creatures, a director in the health department said.

 At the IIT, the levels of larvae were found to be over a 100 times higher than the permissible limit.

 The IIT isnt the only centre of learning that is breeding mosquitoes. Modern Schools branch on Barakhamba Road is the only Delhi school with boarding facilities. But it also tops the list of schools in violating norms meant to prevent mosquito breeding.

 Seer lights up the way

 Kanchi Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswathi has gifted Tirumalas Balaji temple a unique lighting device.

 Last week, he drove to the shrine to personally donate Malai Deepam, a 15-feet high metal lamp weighing 1.5 tonnes. The unique gift is made of panchaloha, an alloy of five metals that includes the famous Chola bronze. A traditional craftsman (sthapathi) in Tamil Nadus Kumbakonam worked on it for months. It cost the Shankaracharya around Rs 10 lakh.

 The lamp is supported by a central column and has series of smaller lamps branching out from a trunk-like shaft, lending the structure an extraordinary aesthetic dimension.

 When the 1,078 lamps are lit, traditionally with ghee and wick, it presents a glorious light pattern before the deity. After worshipping Lord Venkateshwara, Tirumalas presiding deity, Jayendra himself lit the lamp for the first time in the presence of top shrine officials.

 Plot unravels, officer in jam

 First, she signed away a prime government plot to a company that never existed. Then, she almost got away with it. But now, Chandana Khan is up against a legal wall.

 The former tourism secretary is now in a jam as the plot unravels around the shady deal in Andhra Pradesh High Court.

 The senior IAS officer allotted the land to IMG Bharata, which posed as an Indian unit of IMG, one the worlds most diversified sports, entertainment and media firm.

 The government has told the high court that Khan drafted deal papers in such a way that IMG Bharata and IMG appeared to be linked. The doctored documents cleared the way for the allotment of 450 acres in Hyderabad supposedly to build a sports and lifestyle park.

 There were other allotments, too, which add up to 850 acres. Khan signed away the plots during the Telugu Desam government. The Y.S.R. Reddy regime has since seized the land, promoting the company to move court.

 Ticket to comfort

 Mumbais lifeline, the local trains, is set to get a facelift. Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh flagged off the new and improved version that will hopefully make lives of commuters better. The new train, with a sleek look, better ventilation and a public address system, will hit the tracks by October. 

 The railways say in the next two years, 157 such rakes will roll out. Deshmukh may not have travelled in an overcrowded local in a long time but he liked the new look. 

 It looks so nice. I am sure this will go faster than the cars we travel in, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 After gun training, time to log in 

 Jan. 29: The gruelling stints at remote jungle training camps teach them all about guns and grenades. Militants of the Northeast are now having to learn to dot the www and double slash the http, too.

 Shillong is ostensibly the favourite destination of militant recruits looking for training centres where they can learn the basics of computer usage incognito. 

 A member of the Dima Halam Daogah, active in the North Cachar Hills and Karbi Anglong districts of Assam, was arrested in the Meghalaya capital recently midway through a computer course.

 Police suspect that militants of various armed groups are in Shillong for crash courses in cyber weaponry. However, the recruits avoid the more recognised institutions for fear of being noticed. The strict enrolment process is another deterrent.

 An arrested member of the United National Liberation Front of Manipur confessed to the police recently that he was in Shillong to pursue studies.

 Both the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) and Ulfa have long used the Internet for propaganda. Ulfa circulates two bulletins Swadhinata in Assamese and Freedom in English through email. The NSCN (I-M) has an exhaustive official website www.nscnonline.org that not only gives an overview of its campaign for a greater Nagaland but also contains details of Naga history and culture, a chatroom, web links and a guestbook.

 As opposed to the hazards of printing and circulating material, the Internet offers militants absolute anonymity and the advantage of easy communication. No wonder learning how to use a computer has become as important for the new-age militant as handling a Kalashnikov.

 Almost all militant outfits want their cadre to be familiar with information technology to cope with the changing times. Shillong is the favoured destination because of its road links with Mizoram, Tripura and Assam and the porous border with Bangladesh, said a police officer.

 Several militant groups, including the Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup, National Democratic Front of Boroland, NSCN (I-M) and Ulfa, have a presence in Meghalaya.

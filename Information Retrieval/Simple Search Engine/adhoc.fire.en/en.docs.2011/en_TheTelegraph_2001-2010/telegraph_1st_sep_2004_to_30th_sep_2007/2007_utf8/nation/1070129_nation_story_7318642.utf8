 Muharram crackdown in Kashmir

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Srinagar, Jan. 28: The Jammu and Kashmir government today refused to ease the 18-year-old ban on Muharram processions in Srinagar, and arrested scores of mourners after they repeatedly tried to organise marches.

 The state government had imposed the ban, in force in the heart of Srinagar, after the outbreak of militancy in 1989. The processions are allowed in other places.

 But throughout the day, scores of mourners tried to form processions, prompting police to baton-charge them and throw teargas shells to scatter them. Many were injured and arrested.

 Separatist leaders were quick to cry foul.

 We were very optimistic this time that the procession would be allowed. We had applied for permission, said Hurriyat leader and Shia cleric Maulvi Abbas Ansari.

 The government denied permission at the eleventh hour, citing possible Shia-Sunni riots.

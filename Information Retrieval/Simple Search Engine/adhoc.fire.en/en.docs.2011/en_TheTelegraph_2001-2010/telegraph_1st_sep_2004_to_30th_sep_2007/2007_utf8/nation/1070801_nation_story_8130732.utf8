The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Movie buff Kode has a kind side too

 OUR BUREAU AND PTI

 Mumbai, July 31: Pramod Dattaram Kode, the judge who sent Sanjay Dutt to six years in jail today, loves to watch Hindi films.

 He appears to have seen Munnabhai MBBS. Your father acted in Munnabhai and looked better than you, he told the actor, reassuring him the time behind bars would not hurt his career. 

 In the decade that he has conducted the Bombay blasts trial, 54-year-old Kode has played the part of the conscientious lawkeeper glorified in so many Bollywood films to a fault, not taking a day off even when his parents died.

 The judge is believed not to have missed a day in court since 1996 till last month, when a bathroom fall fractured his arm. Sometimes, he has come in on a holiday to pass an order to let an accused visit an ailing relative or attend a funeral.

 Kode has handed death to 12 people and life terms to another 20. Yet, he remains a judge the accused respect because he gives them a patient hearing. Youre like family, Sanjay told him.

 A devotee of Shirdi Sai Baba, he has allowed accused to go on Haj, carry table fans to the jail in the summer and watch patriotic films on August 15 and January 26.

 Today, he was heard telling Sanjay to be calm and quiet. Be like Gregory Peck. Act till you are 100 years, he added, after having told him a little while earlier his character was suspect.

 Kode has faced occasional criticism for being slow he starting delivering his verdict in September last year but has managed to stay out of controversy as one of the longest serving judges in a single court.

 He has plodded through 13,000 pages of oral evidence, 7,000 pages of documentary evidence and 6,700 pages of statements of the accused and has heard 685 witnesses.

 With death threats and Z-category security and an insurance cover of Rs 25 lakh one of the states most protected judges has almost no social life. 

 But when he is not holding court inside Arthur Road Jail, Kode likes to play computer games or watch Hindi films. And he clearly likes to keep people guessing. 

 Sanjay, one of 100 people convicted but the only one whose fate could grip the nation, had to wait till the final day of a 14-year trial before he was called to hear his sentence. 

 The judge could teach Bollywood scriptwriters a thing or two about writing a climax.

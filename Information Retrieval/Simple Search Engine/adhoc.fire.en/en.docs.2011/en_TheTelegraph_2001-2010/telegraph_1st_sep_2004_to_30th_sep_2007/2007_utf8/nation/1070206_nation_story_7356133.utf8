 Power test for five-day week

 Hyderabad: This is one power-packed idea facing a short circuit. Authorities in Andhra Pradesh are warming up to the idea of a five-day week to tide over a power crisis caused partly by the free electricity being given to farmers.

 An extra day at home for employees will save the state 12 per cent of its electricity, says the state commission that sets power tariffs. 

 There will also be less traffic congestion and reduced pressure on urban amenities, according to experts at the citys Administrative Staff College of India. 

 Ironically, opposition has come from government employees, who resent the proposal to scrap casual leaves and the prospect of working longer hours. Sitting at home to watch their favourite TV soaps on 52 extra Saturdays hasnt proved enough of a lure for the privileged lot.

 Lord Shiva vs forefathers

 Chennai: The latest newsmaker in Chennai is neither a film star nor a politician. Its Lord Shiva. The February 16 Shiv Ratri festival, which brings a dash of colour and gaiety to the otherwise sombre city scene, has coincided with Amavasya (New Moon Day). This has sparked a debate on the need to advance the festival by a day this year.

 Devotees sit up all night during Shiv Raatri, when special abhishekams (the ritualistic bath) are held for the Lord from midnight. But since the festival falls on an Amavasya when people remember their forefathers there is an apparent conflict of interest between the Lord himself and mortals who have left his world. 

 Experts in Agamas (manual of temple worship) believe prayers on Amavasya arent effective. The head of Thiruvavaduthurai Aadheenam, one of the states well-known monastic institutions, has urged people to advance Shiv Ratri celebrations to February 15. That should resolve the apparent conflict many are now facing in having to appease both their forefathers and the deity.

 Heritage special

 Delhi: Thirteen hundred years of creativity on show: Indias intellectual and literary ideas inscribed by hand on tree bark, palm leaves, cloth and paper will be on display at an exhibition of manuscripts in the capital this week. 

 Sixth century manuscripts from Gilgit, a 16th century Quran that fits into a palm and an illustrated tale of Vishnu etched in Assamese style on the bark of an aloe tree are among the priceless pieces of heritage to be featured.

 It will be an opportunity for people to explore our intellectual heritage, said Neha Paliwal, coordinator at the National Mission for Manuscripts, started four years ago.

 Handwritten texts of yore from legendary romances to a garland-shaped manuscript of Gita Govinda will also find a place, as will 19th century infantry manuals. The month-long exhibition at National opens on February 7. 

 Gita in Braille

 Bangalore: For Vishwanath, Gita classes meant only hearing discourses, never being able to read. Not any more. The first-ever Braille version of the Gita has just been released. 

 The man behind the feat is N. Krishnan Kutty, who was moved by the blind kids question on whether he would ever be able to read the Gita. Kutty, a retired government employee, took a year and a half to transcribe the Gita onto his computer, using a software developed by IIT Chennai.

 Rotary Club, which runs a blind school, supported the initiative. The club will distribute the volumes free to institutions for the blind across the country.

Mumbai: Savour the Goan Food Festival at Viva Paschim, Worli. Discount of 40% for International Times card members. Vindaloo, Cafreal, stuffed mussels, fish curry and more on the menu. Last day: February 17. Timings: 7 pm to midnight. For details call 24983636/ 24937059

 Success scent on Sonia turf

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Aug. 4: Rae Bareli and Amethi have helped Sonia and Rahul Gandhi reap the sweet smell of success. Now the government led by their party has returned the favour.

 The Centre today launched a project to help farmers in these two constituencies grow and process cash crops that yield essential oils used in perfumes and aromatherapy.

 The new crops will increase the wealth of the farmers by 40 per cent, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said at the Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (Cimap) here.

 The official reason for launching the Aroma Bio-village Project in these two constituencies is that both have a high percentage of saline and degraded soil, unsuitable for foodgrain or vegetable cultivation.

 Both Amethi and Rae Bareli, however, are prosperous areas peopled by rich farmers who have enough fertile land apart from the degraded plots where the aromatic plants will be grown.

 Like the projects sites, the timing of its launch is significant, too. The project is being touted as proof of the governments current stress on agriculture as a national priority ahead of the Prime Ministers August 8 trip to Uttar Pradesh.

 Manmohan Singh, who yesterday promised to come to the rescue of the nations crisis-ridden farmers, is scheduled to visit the project site in Rae Bareli. Sonia, too, during her tour of the constituency last week, had asked farmers to take the help of agricultural scientists and grow new kinds of crops.

 The project will be implemented on 20 hectares in each of the two constituencies, with 60 pioneering farmers benefiting, Cimap director S.P.S. Khanuja said. The crop grown will include lemon grass, palmarosa and vertiver.

 Cimap, a research centre under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, has trained the farmers and will provide them with the seeds and the technology to process oil from the harvest. It will also help them sell the product.

 Diabetes drug rings heart alarm

 Under Attack

 New Delhi, May 22: A drug called rosiglitazone, widely prescribed to patients with diabetes, may increase the risk of heart attacks, a new analysis of medical studies has said and urged both doctors and patients to consider its potential risks. 

 Medical researchers in the US have found that patients on rosiglitazone have a higher risk of heart attacks and even death from cardiovascular causes than patients who are on other anti-diabetic drugs or placebo (sham) pills.

 Steven Nissen and Kathy Wolski at the Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, tracked heart attacks among 15,560 patients who were taking rosiglitazone and 12,283 patients who were receiving other medicines. 

 There were 86 heart attacks among the patients on rosiglitazone and 72 in the others, the researchers said reporting their findings in the New England Journal of Medicine on Monday. 

 The researchers have described their findings as worrisome and urged doctors and patients to consider the risk of serious cardiovascular effects of rosiglitazone treatment for diabetes. 

 The US Food and Drug Administration said on Monday that it was aware of the safety issue related to rosiglitazone, but added that interim results of other studies provide contradictory evidence about the risks to patients. 

 However, the FDA has called on patients who are taking rosiglitazone, especially those who are known to have underlying heart disease, or who are at high risk of heart attack, to talk to their doctors about treatment options. 

 Rosiglitazone, approved in the US in 1999 for the treatment of type-2 diabetes, is widely used in several countries, including India, which is witnessing a burgeoning epidemic of type-2 diabetes brought about by changes in food habits. 

 Drug industry analysts said it appears to be overused in India. 

 There are specific criteria under which it can be used such as only when patients cannot tolerate other established drugs, or when the response from the established drugs is not adequate, said Chandra Gulhati, editor of the Monthly Index of Medical Specialities, India, an independent drugs journal. 

 We know patients whove just been diagnosed with diabetes, but have been asked to take rosiglitazone as the first option, Gulhati told The Telegraph. 

 Sales figures suggest that rosiglitazone prescriptions have been increasing in India, he said. Its more profitable to sell this drug than the older, established ones.

 The Cleveland researchers have said the exact mechanism through which rosiglitazone increases the risk of heart attack and death from cardiovascular causes is uncertain. But they have pointed out possible mechanisms. 

 Rosiglitazone is known to precipitate congestive heart failure. Another possible contributing factor may be its adverse effect on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or bad cholesterol. 

 The label on the FDA-approved rosiglitazone product reports an average 18 per cent increase in bad cholesterol among patients treated for 26 weeks with 8-mg daily dose compared to patients who took no drug. 

 The FDA said that while it is not asking GlaxoSmithKline, the drugs sponsor, to take any specific action at this time, it is providing the information to doctors so that they can make individualised treatment decisions.

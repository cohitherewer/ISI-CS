 Rahul: Flop show

 New Delhi, May 12: The Congresss dismal showing in Uttar Pradesh has reactivated the greybeards who were left out of Rahul Gandhis roadshows.

 Since yesterday, when early trends showed a decline in the share of seats, there were insinuations that had the young MP taken the Congresss seniors on board, it was possible that the party could have performed better.

 Sources in the headquarters at 24 Akbar Road blamed the extended Gandhi Family Limited comprising some young Rajya Sabha members purportedly close to 10 Janpath, the Lok Sabha babalog and the laptop whiz-kids for not crafting an adequately effective strategy to take advantage of the goodwill that Rahuls tours generated.

 Given the hushed reverence with which the Gandhi family members are spoken of, the sources discreetly suggested that Priyanka Vadra had a higher strike rate than her brother in her areas of work. Of the 10 seats in Rae Bareli and Amethi the Gandhis pocket boroughs the Congress won eight.

 There was no comment but a repeated mention of the fact that Priyankas long-drawn presence here made the difference between near defeat and victory.

 In 2002, the Congress had lost all the seats in Amethi and Rae Bareli. So, we started on a clean slate. But the point was that infighting was so rampant that at one point, Priyanka left a workers meeting in disgust. There were charges like how Amethi MLA Ameeta Singh was in league with the RSS and so on. But once Priyanka cracked the whip, the rebels fell like ninepins, said a Uttar Pradesh source.

 The source was, however, quick to clarify that his observation was not a reflection on Rahul. What could he do? It was too late to repair the organisation in each and every constituency, he said.

 While the state Congress was held culpable for the infighting, the Rahul brigade was criticised for strategising on the laptop without factoring the truths on ground zero. Rahuls key aides were Kanishka Singh, a former investment banker from the US, and Sachin Rao, a Michigan University product. Kanishka was by his side while Rao operated from an exclusive control room opened in Delhi.

 The sources wondered why MPs from the southern states, not fluent in Hindi, were deployed full-time to get feedback on the roadshows impact and settle local fights. The seniors were reportedly piqued at the way in which 24 Akbar Road was virtually shut off from the Rahul project. 

 The central control room and media cells, too, had no idea of what was happening on the roadshow.

 So, when he made his controversial statements on the Babri mosque and the creation of Bangladesh, for quite a while the designated media managers had no idea how they should respond to the Oppositions counter-statements. Later, a spin was put out on how Rahuls utterances were part of an evolved strategy to take on the BJP in the urban areas on the theme of nationalism and secularism.

 Sources hoped in the days to come there would be greater synergy between Rahul and the Congresss political hub.

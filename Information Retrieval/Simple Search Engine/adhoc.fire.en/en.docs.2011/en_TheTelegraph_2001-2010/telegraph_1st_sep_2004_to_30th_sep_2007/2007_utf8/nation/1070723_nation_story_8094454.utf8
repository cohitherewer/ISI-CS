 Taste of hilsa in Dhaka talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Ramesh

 New Delhi, July 22: The flavour of Bangladeshi hilsa lingered over a bouquet of promises Jairam Ramesh today presented in Dhaka, the first of which related to testing facilities for the fish at the Petrapole border near Calcutta. 

 Bangladesh has banned for six months the export of the fish, which is a favourite with Bengalis everywhere and is also appreciated across Indias fish-eating communities. This is the season that yields some of the best catch.

 On top of Rameshs agenda is a request to Dhaka to lift the ban, which came into effect this month. 

 But the minister of state for commerce is apparently not aware of Dhakas response, if any, as he made no mention of it in his speech when the India-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry was opened today. 

 He has offered Dhaka proposals to intensify trade, taking a cue from Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs statement that India would give its neighbours a stake in its economy. 

 Ramesh began by saying testing facilities for the hilsa at Petrapole the crossing near Bongaon northeast of Calcutta would follow an agreement between the Bureau of Indian Standards and the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution.

 In response, Delhi expects Dhaka to lift non-tariff barriers on Indian goods.

 India has begun modernising five land customs stations along the border with Bangladesh Petrapole, Hilli and Changrabandha in Bengal, Agartala in Tripura and Dawki in Meghalaya that would cost about Rs 320 crore. 

 The package Ramesh unveiled today was conditional on Dhaka reciprocating to at least a few of the proposals. But India was prepared to give more than what she gets. 

 He said India was reviewing its restrictions on foreign direct investment from Bangladesh. It is likely that Delhi will shortly lift these restrictions for Bangladeshi businessmen and allow them to invest on a case-to-case basis, subject to security clearance. 

 Ramesh repeated the Indian request for transit rights through Bangladesh. He also said India wanted access to a mooring terminal that recently opened in Chittagong Port.

 Among other things, we will offer Bangladesh a huge market in northeastern India, the minister said.

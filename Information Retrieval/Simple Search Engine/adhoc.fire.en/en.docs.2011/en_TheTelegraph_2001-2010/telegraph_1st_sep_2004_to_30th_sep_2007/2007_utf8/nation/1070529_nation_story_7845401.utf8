 Shinde, wrapped in DMK shawl

 New Delhi, May 28: A thoughtful M. Karunanidhi today brought to Delhi the regulation shawls and a suggestion on the presidential candidate. 

 The DMK boss has apparently indicated that he would prefer a Dalit to be the next President. An aide suggested power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde could be his choice.

 The proposal is being seen as a component of Karunanidhis own brand of social engineering by reaching out to the Dalits of Tamil Nadu, who form 25 per cent of the states population. They are largely supporters of the ADMK or smaller caste-based parties. 

 Backing a person like Shinde will be politically significant, even if it is symbolic, the aide said. 

 The only time the DMK supported a Brahmin candidate was in 1969, when Indira Gandhi persuaded the party to vote for V.V. Giri, an Andhra Brahmin, the aide said.

 However, if a non-Dalit/upper caste name became inevitable, the DMK would go along with the UPA. Theres no question of opposition or dissent. We have reviewed our attitude to high castes from time to time, the aide said. 

 Today, Karunanidhi met Sonia Gandhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and other leaders. He did not forget to gift shawls to Sonia and Manmohan.

 As word got around that Shinde was on Karunanidhis radar, there was worry in the Congress camp that the Dalit MP from Maharashtra may not emerge as a consensus candidate. A common ground could be reached, for instance, on Pranab Mukherjee. 

 Shinde lost the 2002 vice-presidential election against Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, thanks to cross-voting. He has fears of a repeat, but the DMK believes Shinde could even garner Shiv Sena votes on regional sentiment. 

 The DMK and Left agreed that if the presidential candidate was from the Congress, the vice-president should be from other parties in the UPA. Karunanidhi is expected again in Delhi on June 5 or 6. By then, the final names should be in place.

 Two more names Shivraj Patil and Motilal Vora were added to the Congresss list of candidates. However, a PTI report quoted Congress spokesperson Satyavrat Chaturvedi as saying the party was not ruling out an apolitical person for the Presidents post.

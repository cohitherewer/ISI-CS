 Hint at riot fast court

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug 9: The state government today promised to consider a fast-track court to implement the Srikrishna Commission report, which nailed political bigwigs for the 1993 Bombay riots.

 It also indicated it might set up a panel of impartial officers, headed by the state police chief, to probe why the report that indicted top Shiv Sena leaders, such as Bal Thackeray and Manohar Joshi, wasnt acted on.

 Both demands had been made by a group of minority leaders who, led by filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt and Congress MLA Naseem Khan, had met chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on July 24. Deshmukhs assurance came today as pressure mounted on him to reopen the cases against the indicted politicians.

 Khan welcomed Deshmukhs statement. Our two demands were: a panel of impartial officers led by the director-general of police, P.S. Pasricha, to probe the lapses and a fast-track court. So, we sincerely hope justice would be done, he said.

 The state government must write to Chief Justice Swantanter Kumar of Bombay High Court to set up a fast-track court.

 The inaction on the riots that killed 900 people mostly Muslims and the recent convictions again of mostly Muslims in the 1993 blasts case have laid the government open to the charge of discrimination. The state recently sought legal opinion whether the riot cases against politicians could be reopened.

 An online signature campaign started by human rights activist Teesta Setalvad, who also fought Gujarat riot cases, was made public at the Indian Merchants Chamber today.

 Eminent citizens such as Cyruz Guzder, former Punjab police chief Julius Ribeiro, ad guru Alyque Padamsee, actor Rahul Bose and minority leader Maulana Athar Ali were at the meeting.

 Ribeiro said it was impossible to find and punish every single killer, but it was possible to identify those who instigated the riots.

 We know who instigated it, he said referring to a TV interview in which Thackeray is believed to have justified the Senas retaliation.

 The Congresss poll manifesto speaks of implementing the Srikrishna report and recently, Sonia Gandhi is believed to have nudged the Deshmukh government to act.

 When the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party wrested power from the Sena-BJP in 1999, they set up a special task force headed by K.P. Raghuvanshi to reopen all the riot cases. The STF examined 1,483 cases, including 112 key ones, but filed fresh charge-sheets in only nine.

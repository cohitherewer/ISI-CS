 Reliance retail 

 layoff 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Sept. 26: After the closures, the sacking orders.

 Reliance Retail is apparently laying off 1,000 employees in Uttar Pradesh, where its stores were ordered to close after traders protests and ransacking sparked law and order fears.

 Some of the 10 stores, called Reliance Fresh, that opened last month had to down shutters almost immediately.

 We have issued termination notices to 1,000 employees. We dont have plans to leave Uttar Pradesh, but for the moment everything is on hold, a company official was quoted as saying by Reuters. Over 2,800 employees were hired and the company had plans to recruit 5,000 more.

 The backlash against the dismissals has begun. About 500 of those sacked squatted in front of the Vidhan Sabha demanding compensation from the government. 

 We hoped that the impasse over law and order will be resolved but the government hasnt broken its silence, said Randhir Srivastava, a trainee who was asked to leave. Srikant Mishra also blamed the government. I am on the streets because of the governments decision.

 Heat on Amar

 A government probe panel today recommended action against Amar Singh and 27 others over irregularities in plot allotments in an upscale Lucknow area. The committee suggested cancellation of the 28 allotments, saying they had caused the state a loss of Rs 2.3 crore.

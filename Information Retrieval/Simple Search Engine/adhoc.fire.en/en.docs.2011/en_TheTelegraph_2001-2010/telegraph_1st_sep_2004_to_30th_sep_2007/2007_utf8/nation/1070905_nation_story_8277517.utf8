 CMs new avatar: Krishna

 Modi: Holy turn?

 Surat, Sept. 4 (PTI): T-shirts depicting Narendra Modi as Lord Krishna surfaced at several places in the city on Janmashtami today.

 The T-shirts, with colour pictures of the Gujarat chief minister, were distributed by the Surat City Govinda Utsav Samiti, a body that is organising programmes to celebrate Krishnas birth.

 Samiti president C.R. Patil said: These T-shirts were supplied to us by a city-based firm engaged in the dyeing business that wished to highlight the good work of the chief minister, particularly for Surat, in the past several years.

 The firm sponsored all the 11,000 T-shirts and asked us to keep its name confidential, Patil, a BJP leader, added.

 These T-shirts have been distributed in all the 65 mandalis under the samiti.

 Samiti vice-president Ganesh Sawant said he saw nothing wrong in the Modi T-shirts.

 Youths would wear the T-shirts for the Janmashtami programmes.

 According to Sawant, the firm had initially supplied 9,000 T-shirts but when the demand for them increased, it printed 2,000 more.

 These T-shirts are a big hit, especially among children, he added.

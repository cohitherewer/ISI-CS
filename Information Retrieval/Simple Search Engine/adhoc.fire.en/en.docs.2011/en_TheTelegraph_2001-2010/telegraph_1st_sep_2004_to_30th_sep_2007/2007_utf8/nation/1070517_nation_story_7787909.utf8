 Sponsors hide cricket wallet

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 May 16: Are you nursing ambitions of becoming a cricketer? Better if you try golf.

 Cricket appears to have lost some of its sheen at least for advertisers after Indias disastrous World Cup campaign. The bitter awakening came after the BCCIs marketing team went in search of advertisers for two forthcoming offshore fixtures.

 It found that sponsors who all these years had deep pockets for the board were busy hiding their wallets.

 They are acting like a cartel. It is all a ploy to arm-twist the BCCI and pull down the basic price for the sponsorships as set by us, said a member of the cricket boards marketing committee.

 The official denied that the sponsor famine had anything to do with disenchantment of advertisers with cricket.

 This is all a bunkum being floated around to pull down the prices. No advertiser believes that cricket as a brand has lost its sheen. But the World Cup performance of Team India has given them an opportunity to get an upper hand for a while, the BCCI official added.

 But industry sources said marketers were looking beyond cricket to bond with fans. LG, one of the largest spenders on cricket till sometime ago, now keeps aside 40 per cent of its sports sponsorship and advertising expenditure for events other than cricket.

 The sources said Hero Honda, another regular cricket sponsor, is now upping its stake in golf.

 The BCCI had quoted a base price of Rs 2.45 crore per match for the three one-dayers India will play in Belfast against South Africa and Ireland in June and July.

 An electronic major, which showed initial interest in the tenders floated for the matches, said: The BCCI is over-quoting. If they think we are haggling for a good bargain, whats wrong with it? They need to bring the basic price down by a good crore.

 Contrast this with the Rs 3 crore per match base price which the BCCI quoted till before the World Cup.

 Thats not all. There are no takers for the India-Pakistan one-dayer to be played in Scotland on July 3. Dejected BCCI officials said they were in talks with an alcoholic drinks company, but nothing can be revealed about it at present.

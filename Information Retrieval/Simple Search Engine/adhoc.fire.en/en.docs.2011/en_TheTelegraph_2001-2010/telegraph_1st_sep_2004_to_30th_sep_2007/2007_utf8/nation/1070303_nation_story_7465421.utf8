 New Delhi, March 2: Rahul Dravids XI is not the only Indian team at the World Cup a 16-member squad is leaving for Port of Spain on Monday and will be there at the Kensington Oval on April 28 for the final.

 The team of bomb disposal experts from the National Security Guards (NSG) will scan cricket grounds as well as hotels where the teams are put up, on a request from the West Indian Cricket Board. It will play a crucial role in sanitising the Kensington Oval stadium in Barbados, a senior home ministry official said. 

 Senior government officials said the request for security assistance the first of its kind was cleared immediately, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh himself putting a stamp of approval on it.

 The squad will focus especially on grounds where the Australia, England, India and Pakistan teams will face off. Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua, the Providence stadium in Guyana, Sabina Park in Jamaica and Queens Park Oval in Trinidad are among them, sources said.

 The NSG team is not meant for the Indian team, but for the security of all the cricket World Cup events. Security of the Indian players will be looked after by the respective West Indies authorities and World Cup organisers, an official clarified.

 The experts will be in the Caribbean from March 7 six days before the first match is played to April 30. 

 A two-member team of senior officials from the Intelligence Bureau and the NSG was in Port of Spain from February 24 to March 1 to assess the security requirements. Based on their reports, the Union home ministry decided to send a team of 16 bomb disposal experts. 

 Other than the NSG men, two senior IB officials will also help the World Cup organisers monitor the security threat perception. 

 These officials will work along with West Indies security officials at the Regional Intelligence Fusion Centre that Interpol had helped the Caribbean countries set up to collate, analyse and disseminate relevant law enforcement information before and during the event.

 Srinagar, May 28: Mounds of garments will be destroyed in Kashmir as part of the efforts to enforce the states 10-year-old ban on fur trade.

 Nearly 32 lakh rare animals, including snow leopards, red deer, musk deer, brown bear, tigers and common leopards, were killed to produce 8.5 lakh garments. These are now being seized by the states wildlife authorities.

 The fur trade was banned in our state in 1997. Now, we have started the process of collecting 8.5 lakh garments. These will be burnt over the next couple of days and weeks, said Rashid Naqash, the wildlife warden of central Kashmir.

 Before the ban, thousands in Kashmir made a living from fur trade, selling garments in other states and abroad. Animals were killed outside the state, too, but Kashmir specialised in making fur garments, Naqash said.

 The Farooq Abdullah regime had ordered the ban under pressure from wildlife activists, but the clampdown had triggered strong protests by fur traders. Two artisans, robbed off their livelihood, reportedly committed suicide. 

 After the ban, the garments were being handed over to the authorities, but the fur traders who had to bear the losses moved court for compensation. The court has now directed the government to pay traders a compensation of Rs 9.42 crore. We are following the court directive and collecting the hides from them, Naqash said. 

 By agreeing to pay traders, the government has sent a strong message against fur trade.

 We had received suggestions that these hides should be put on sale but we have turned them down. We have decided to burn them, said A. K. Srivastava, the states chief wildlife warden.

 Govt prolongs IIM agony

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dholakia

New Delhi, April 23: The human resource development ministry is keeping the Indian Institutes of Management in suspense over admissions even after the Supreme Court refused to lift the stay on the introduction of the OBC quota from this academic session.

 We will wait for the government to withdraw its earlier directives, said an IIM academic.

 The government had asked the countrys premier B-schools to keep on hold all admissions for the 2007-08 session. Some of the IIMs wanted to release the general-category admission list on April 21, but the government stalled the move.

 The B-schools and students who have cleared the common admission test (CAT) have been on tenterhooks for almost a month since the apex court ordered the stay.

 After todays order, the HRD ministry went into a huddle but remained silent on admissions. Sources said they had another plan. 

 IIM Ahmedabad director Bakul Dholakia said, We would expect the government to take a decision pretty soon.

 If the HRD ministry revises its directives, we will be able to decide our course of action straight away, Dholakia said.

 He added that the directors of all six IIMs would meet to discuss the matter and await a fresh directive from the ministry.

 Till then, it will not be possible to make any observation one way or the other at this point of time.

 The CAT committee will meet as soon as the IIMs receive a directive. Each IIM will then put out the admissions lists on its website.

 Asked if the stay would disturb the IIMs academic schedules this year, Dholakia said: At this point of time, there is no such indication. If there is a communication by the government in one or two days, we will adjust the schedule accordingly.

 All stakeholders are interested in the welfare of the students and everybody agrees on this.

 The IIMs said there would be no expansion as envisaged under the new quota regime in this academic session. Our expansion was always related to the OBC quota. Now, there will be no expansion because there is no quota for this year, an IIM official said. 

 IIMs and IITs have been resenting the pressure being mounted on them because of the HRD ministrys OBC quota law. They had placed their arguments before the Veerappa Moily committee on reservation, and it was decided that the expansion would be carried out in three phases. It was up to each institute to plan its expansion.

 The institutes that had lined up the minimum expansion in the first phase are the least affected. For instance, IIM Calcutta was to increase 6 per cent of its seats to accommodate OBC students, which meant an addition of only 18 seats.

 The additional seats created in the IIMs will not go to any other category of students. Usually, the reserved seats for SC/STs do not go to any other category even if they are not filled, an IIM official said.

 The Supreme Courts stay has created a messy situation for both IIMs and the government. The HRD ministry, which had hoped the quota issue would pay electoral dividends, is on the back foot. But the students are the worst affected.

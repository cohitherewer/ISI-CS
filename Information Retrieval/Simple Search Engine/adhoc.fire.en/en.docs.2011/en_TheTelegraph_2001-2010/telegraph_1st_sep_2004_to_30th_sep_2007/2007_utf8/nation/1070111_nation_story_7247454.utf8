 Chennai, Jan. 10: India today launched four satellites on a single rocket for the first time, including one that will be brought back to earth to set the stage for the country to send an astronaut into space.

 The successful launch was also the first after the Indian Space Research Organisations plan to put one of its heaviest satellites into space failed last July as the rocket went into a tailspin and disintegrated soon after lift-off.

 The PSLV-C7 rocket today took off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre launchpad in Sriharikota, 90 km from Chennai, carrying two small Indian satellites and one each from Indonesia and Argentina.

 We have done it, we have done it well, we have done it correctly, Isro chairman G. Madhavan Nair said after the launch. It was a successful textbook mission and our boys have done well.

 One of the Indian satellites, the 550-kg Space Capsule Recovery Equipment (SRE-1), would test Isros ability to recover an orbiting space capsule and technology associated with the complicated exercise.

 The PSLV again proved it was a reliable, sturdy launch vehicle in its ninth consecutive successful mission today, as it majestically lifted off at 9.23 am in perfect weather.

 As the 44.4-metre PSLV-C7, which alternately uses solid and liquid propulsion systems, roared into the sky, space scientists and engineers at the mission control centre bided a nail-biting 19 minutes or so until the fourth satellite separated as planned.

 The four satellites injected into a high polar orbit at an altitude of 637 km include Indias Cartosat-2, a special remote sensing satellite, and the SRE-1 being sent up for the first time.

 The other two are LAPAN-TUBSAT, Indonesias satellite to observe the earth with two very sensitive cameras, and the PEHUENSAT-1, Argentinas small 6-kg satellite that will serve as a platform for educational and scientific experiments.

 After every stage of the burnout of the four-stage PSLV-C7, the mission control kept announcing the vehicle is going perfectly as per the normal course. 

 It also kept saying the performance of the booster motors at each stage was normal, scotching fears of a repeat of the GSLV fiasco.

 When the PSLV almost attained a circular orbit 15 minutes after take-off and shortly after injected Cartosat-2 into orbit, the first smile of relief showed on Nairs face. The scientists cheered up a little more as its solar panels were immediately deployed, indicating that the mission was half-successful.

 Less than five minutes later, when all four satellites had been injected into orbit, jubilation broke out in the control room.

 Nair went around and hugged the team leaders who had made the four-in-one historic mission possible. Over the past two months, Isro had been grappling with the Herculean task of assembling the vehicle and mating four satellites with it.

 It is a great day for the country. all the four satellites have been put in their intended orbit, a delighted Nair said, patting the team for having captured back the confidence of the Indian space programme.

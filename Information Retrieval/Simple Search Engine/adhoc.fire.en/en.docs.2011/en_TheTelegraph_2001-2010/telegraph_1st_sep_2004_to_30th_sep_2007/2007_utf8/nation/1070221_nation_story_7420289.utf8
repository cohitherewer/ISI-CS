 DRDO looks to Kalam boost

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is scheduled to return tomorrow to the defence research outfit he headed and shaped. 

 Kalam is understood to have wanted to address military scientists many of whom were his colleagues after a string of recent failures embarrassed the organisation. Among his audience will be directors of all Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) laboratories and chief controllers of its research projects. 

 The President and supreme commander of the armed forces is understood to have volunteered to address the gathering. The occasion is an annual meeting of DRDO heads. 

 Kalam, who headed the DRDO from 1992 to 1999 and earned his reputation as Indias missile man while with the organisation, is understood to have been making inquiries on the projects he began. 

 He is expected to outline his vision for the DRDO and offer words of encouragement to the scientists. The government has been concerned that slippages in DRDO projects were burdensome because of time and cost overruns. 

 The defence ministry is working on a plan that officials say will make the DRDO more accountable. It is likely to appoint nominees of the Indian Space Research Organisation and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) at monitoring positions in the DRDO. 

 The allocations for DRDO in the current budget total Rs 5,454 crore, more than the outlay for higher education. 

 Kalam founded the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) for the DRDO that was responsible for the weaponisation and equipping of the armed forces with five missiles and their variants the Nag (an anti-tank guided missile), the Prithvi (surface-to-surface battlefield missile), Akash (medium-range surface-to-air missile), Trishul (quick-reaction surface-to-air missile with a shorter range) and the Agni series of ballistic missiles. 

 He was also at the centre of Indias nuclear weaponisation projects. But nearly all the missile development programmes plus many of the DRDOs numerous projects have slipped on schedule. 

 The government last year wanted to close down the Trishul project but the DRDOs argument that India would lose its capability in short-range missile defence ultimately prevailed and the project was given an extension at the last minute. 

 Only the Prithvi has been fully inducted into the army. Among DRDOs recent failures has been the Agni III, the long-range variant in the Agni series, designed with strategic intent and a range of about 3,000 km, that could not meet test requirements last July. 

 The DRDO project for a Light Combat Aircraft is years behind schedule and has been cited by the air force as a major reason for costly imports. Only last fortnight the DRDO-assisted project with Hindustan Aeronautics for an intermediate jet trainer proved an embarrassment at the Bangalore air show when the test-pilot had to abort take-off and it crashed.

 The Shiv Sena chief was today arrested for failing to appear before a sessions court in connection with a complaint accusing him of making inflammatory remarks against north Indians.

 Human rights groups have repeatedly urged the government to take legal action against Thackeray for his provocative writings in the Sena mouthpiece Saamna.

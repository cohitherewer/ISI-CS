 Maharashtras SEZ challenge

 Mumbai (PTI): Maharashtra, which has got one-third of the 237 special economic zones (SEZs) sanctioned so far, will have to acquire 50,000 acres of additional land to meet the requirement of the 72 proposed SEZs.

 Of the 72, five have been notified, 25-plus have received in-principle approvals and the rest have been approved.

 The states nodal agency, MIDC (Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation), has got 1,40,000 acres of land in its possession and requires another 50,000 acres to meet the demand for SEZs, a state government official said.

 Of the proposed SEZs, 18 would be developed jointly by the MIDC and private players. The 50,000 acres to be acquired includes land for the SEZs to be developed by Bharat Forge, Mahindra, Videocon and the Supreme group, totalling 11,000 hectares. Pune-based Bharat Forge would require the maximum (around 6,500 hectares) land among all these SEZs, the official added.

 Plea to get bribe money back

 New Delhi (PTI): A Delhi-based contractor who helped the CBI trap an allegedly corrupt engineer accepting a bribe, has moved court seeking refund of his money used in the operation.

 Daya Ram Tyagi has sought the refund of Rs 25,000 deposited with the CBI court as evidence.

 Such money is usually released after the trial concludes, but the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) contractor has sought its return citing financial difficulties. 

 Mehroze Khan, a junior DDA engineer was arrested in September 2005 after Tyagi complained that Khan had demanded a bribe of Rs 80,000 to clear Tyagis bills.

 Mother tongue

 New Delhi (PTI): A government survey has found there has been an increase in the number of schools which prefer the mother tongue as the medium of instruction.

 The survey found over 92 per cent primary schools teach using the mother tongue, compared to about 91 per cent schools in 1996.

 Exam guards

 Shimla (PTI): The Himachal Pradesh government has decided to hire ex-soldiers to guard test centres for the school board examinations, as part of its anti-cheating drive. Teachers and staff conducting the tests have faced threats in the past because of shortage of guards.

 Wife set on fire

 Ahmedabad (PTI): A man was arrested on Sunday for allegedly setting his wife on fire in Surat city, police said. Zubeida Mokin Ansari, 22, sustained 60 per cent burns. Her husband allegedly took the step over her failure to bear a child.

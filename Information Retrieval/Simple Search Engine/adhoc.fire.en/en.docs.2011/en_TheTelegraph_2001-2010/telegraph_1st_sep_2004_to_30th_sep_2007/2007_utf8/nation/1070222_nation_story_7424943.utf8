 Thiruvananthapuram, Feb. 21: The death of 15 children and three teachers when their boat capsized in the Periyar river in Kerala has laid bare the callousness of the state government that is eager to rake in revenues from tourism without a care for safety.

 As the tiny hamlet of Elavoor, about 70 km from Kochi, bid a tearful farewell to the victims, the Kerala government today announced an ex-gratia of Rs 200,000 to each bereaved family and ordered a probe by director-general of police Ramon Srivastava. Chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan announced a judicial inquiry.

 But there has been no word either from the chief minister or tourism minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan on what they propose to do with boat operators who blatantly violate the law. Sources at the Inspectorate of Boats at Alappuzha say there are about 1,000 small boats operating at tourist centres across Kerala and half of them do not have licences.

 Thiruvananthapuram collector N. Ayyappan said none of the nearly 50 boats plying from tourism centres in the district has the licence issued by the chief inspector of boats. These include vessels belonging to the District Tourism Promotion Council.

 The sources said none of the small boats at the tourist centres has adequate safety gear like life belts and life jackets.

 In all, 110 students all aged below 10 and six teachers of St Antonys Upper Primary School at Elavoor in Ernakulam had set out on a picnic yesterday morning.

 Sivaranjini, the boat that capsized in the Bhoothathankettu reservoir near the sanctuary, was carrying 50 students though its capacity was 10. Raju, the owner and a crew member of the ill-fated boat, has gone into hiding.

 The children who survived said they saw water gushing through a leak in the boats planks when it reached the middle of the reservoir. Raju tried to steer the boat away from the artificial depths created by sand-miners, but it overturned. 

 State human rights commission chairperson Justice N. Dhinakar has asked chief secretary Lizzie Jacob to immediately submit details of the accident.

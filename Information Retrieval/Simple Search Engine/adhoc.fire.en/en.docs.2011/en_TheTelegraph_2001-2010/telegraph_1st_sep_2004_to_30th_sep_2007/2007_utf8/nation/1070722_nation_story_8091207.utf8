 Haneef deport call to save face

 Haneef and Firdous during a vacation in Australia

 July 21: As pressure mounted on the Australian government to explain the bungles in the Mohammed Haneef case, media reports said it was planning to deport the Indian doctor to save itself further embarrassment. 

 Get this guy out of Australia. The story ends there and he can become someone elses problem, a government source was quoted as saying.

 The government had cancelled Haneefs visa to keep him in detention as a terrorist after he was granted bail on Monday by a magistrate, who said she saw no direct link between Haneef and the UK terror plot he was charged with supporting.

 Since then, bungle after bungle has surfaced newspapers today said police sources had confirmed that the crucial evidence about Haneefs SIM card being at the scene of the failed Glasgow bombing was wrong putting the government on the mat.

 An angry Queensland Premier Peter Beattie described the case as sloppy. 

 Im deeply concerned about where we are, Beattie said. If they have stuffed this up, they should come clean. There are now too many questions and its just looking sloppy.

 The media has uncovered inconsistencies between what Haneef told the police and what was reported to the court. The court was told Haneef had admitted to sharing accommodation in the UK with second cousins Sabeel and Kafeel Ahmed, who are terror suspects, and that he had no explanation for a one-way ticket to India. Both claims were exposed as false.

 In Bangalore, minister of state for external affairs E. Ahamed said: This matter has not made anybody happy. Everyone is unhappy.... The legal fraternity, human rights activists and the media. Even in Australia, they are unhappy.

 We have taken the issue very seriously. Yesterday, an MEA officer met Dr Haneef in the detention centre and the doctor is in good health. 

 Imran Siddiqui, a relative, reached Brisbane tonight to offer support. Someone has to be here from home, he said.

 Siddiqui is a cousin of Haneefs wife Firdous Arshiya, who said: He will liaise with the counsel and inform the family back home on a daily basis. He is carrying documents to help the lawyers.

 Now it appears Haneef might be sent back immediately. Several government sources said they were furious with the police handling of the case and wanted to shut it down before it damaged the governments credibility further in an election year.

 Our best option is to cancel the Criminal Justice Certificate, which was issued to keep Haneef here in Australia after we cancelled his visa, and that is my understanding of what our intentions are, one government source said.

 Attorney-general Philip Ruddock, who issued the certificate, would only say he had not ruled out cancelling it.

 The SIM card had been crucial to the case the police had made out against Haneef in court. They charged him with recklessly supporting a terrorist organisation because he had given his SIM card to Sabeel a year ago. Prosecutor Clive Porritt told the court the SIM card was found in the jeep that crashed into Glasgow airport in the failed terror attack. 

 Then, a media report revealed the SIM card was found in Liverpool, hundreds of kilometres away from the bombing site, and several newspapers today said police sources had confirmed this. 

 Police sources were quoted as saying they had been aware of the error for some time but no attempt had been made to correct the public record.

 AFP commissioner Mick Keelty and ministers in the John Howard government refused to explain the matter or offer apologies. But Prime Minister Howard, who had earlier robustly defended Haneefs detention, appeared to distance himself from the case, saying any criticism should be directed to the prosecutors and not the government.

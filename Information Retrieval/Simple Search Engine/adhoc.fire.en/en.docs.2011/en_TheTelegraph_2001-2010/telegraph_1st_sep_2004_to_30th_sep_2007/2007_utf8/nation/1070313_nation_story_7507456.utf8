 EC cracks election whip

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 12: The Election Commission today directed that no more than five persons, including the candidate, should be allowed in the room of returning officers or assistant returning officers at the time of filing papers for the Uttar Pradesh polls.

 The commission warned the state government that the presence of more than five persons would be considered a violation of its directives.

 The panel also directed that no more than three vehicles would be permitted within 100 metres of the office of the returning officer or the assistant returning officer. If more vehicles were found, expenses relating to all the vehicles would be treated as part of the candidates expenditure.

 A total of 62 constituencies will go to polls in the first phase of the elections on April 7. The seven-phase elections would be held on April 7, 13, 18, 23, 28, May 3 and 8 for the 403 member House. 

 As several parties had expressed apprehension that free and fair elections would not be possible under the Mulayam Singh Yadav government, the poll panel has made unprecedented arrangements for the seven-phase electoral exercise that will continue for a month.

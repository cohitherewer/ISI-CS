 Indian sent home after assault

 Trenton (New Jersey), April 15 (AP): An Indian who had filed a brutality complaint against a New Jersey township police officer last year was deported on Thursday.

 Rajnikant Parikh was watching an illegal fireworks show when he was arrested, and authorities accused him of hitting officer Michael Dotro and telling others in the crowd to do the same.

 He was arrested again a month later by immigration officials while he was holding a rally to protest police brutality. The officials said they found an outstanding order of deportation against him.

 US Immigrant and Customs Enforcement officials said the US Border Patrol in 1995 had taken Parikh then Amit Sheth into custody. He was to be deported the following year for illegal entry, but in 1999 he obtained a visa under his current name.

 Parikh continued to fight his charges after the arrests, but New Jersey authorities found neither Dotro nor the department had committed any wrongdoing. 

 Parikhs lawyer said the deportation does not mean the legal battle is over.

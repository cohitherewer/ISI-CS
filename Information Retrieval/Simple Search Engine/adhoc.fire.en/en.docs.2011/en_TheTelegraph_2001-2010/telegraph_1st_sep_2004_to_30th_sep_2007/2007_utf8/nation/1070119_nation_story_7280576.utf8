 Ministers vote jab at CM office 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 18: The Left Front wrangle over the CAB presidents election turned murkier today with CPI minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya accusing the chief ministers office of meddling in the vote.

 I have news the CMO has sent letters to all district magistrates asking them to ensure their clubs vote for Prasun Mukherjee, he said before praising the city police chiefs prospective rival, sports minister Subhas Chakraborty, as the right man to head the state cricket body.

 Such a letter, the water resources minister added, would be highly illegal. Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said no such letter had been issued.

 Unlike the previous CAB election, where he had played an active role, the chief minister has so far not intervened this time.

 There may have been a hint of sarcasm in Bhattacharyas voice as he said he was ready to give Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee the benefit of the doubt. Possibly, the chief minister is not aware of this just as he had pleaded ignorance about the acquisition notification issued by Haldia Development Authority on Nandigram (which set off the violence)!

 Bhattacharya cited Mukherjees pressing job of handling city law and order to argue against his candidature.

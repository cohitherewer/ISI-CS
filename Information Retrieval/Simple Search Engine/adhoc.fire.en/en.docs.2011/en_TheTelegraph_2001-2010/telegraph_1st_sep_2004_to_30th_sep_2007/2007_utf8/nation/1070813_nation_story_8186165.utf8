 Karat cracks Kerala whip

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 12: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat today said the central party leadership could intervene, if necessary, to enforce discipline in the faction-ridden Kerala unit.

 The party has worked out a set of special guidelines for discussions and debates at its 26,000 grassroots branch committees that start in September ahead of the CPM state conference in February in Kottayam.

 The party politburo would be watching and could act any time to enforce the guidelines, Karat said at a news conference.

 Three months ago, in its biggest-ever disciplinary action, the CPM had suspended Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan and party state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan from its politburo because of the way they were fighting each other in public.

 Karat confirmed that the general manager of party organ Deshabhimani, E.P. Jayarajan, had been relieved of the post for his lack of vigilance that led to the newspaper accepting four deposits (of Rs 50 lakh each) from lottery operators and agents (Coimbatore-based lotto king Santeago Martins sons).

 Jayarajan, the latest entrant into the party central committee from Kerala, is close to Vijayan, who was seated beside Karat at the news conference.

 Karat, who last night met the head of the Malankara Catholic Church, Archbishop Baselios Mar Cleemis, and the Bishop of Kollam, Stanely Roman, said the CPM would work to protect the minority rights guaranteed in the Constitution.

 But we need to address issues concerning social equity while trying to harmonise it with privileges, he said.

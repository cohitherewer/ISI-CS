 Punjab pitch for GM crop

 New Delhi, Jan. 19: Proponents of genetically modified (GM) crops have picked Ravindra Brar, a farmer from Punjab, to counter what anti-GM activists claim is a global reaction against genetic engineering.

 Speaking at the release of a global status report on GM crops here, Brar, who grows wheat, guava and cotton on her 62-acre farm in Punjab, said she has benefited from GM cotton.

 The report, released today by the International Services for the Acquisition of Agribiotech Applications, said in 2006, India for the first time had more land (3.8 million hectares) under GM cotton than China (3.5 million hectares).

 The report said the number of farmers worldwide growing biotech crops had surged past 10 million in 2006 and predicted that the total area under GM crops would double to 200 million hectares by 2015.

 The coming decade is likely to feature strong growth in Asia, led by India, China and other countries, said Clive James, chairman of the board of directors of the body, a non-government organisation involved in the promotion of crop biotechnology.

 My results with cotton were very good, Brar said, but questions about the quantum of profits emerged after she claimed the switch to GM cotton had helped her increase her income by an average of Rs 15,000 per acre.

 Brar conceded her calculations did not include field preparation, diesel, sowing, picking, and miscellaneous expenses, and that the net profit may be lower than the figure she cited first. For me, doing was believing, she said about her decision to switch to GM cotton.

 The second decade of the commercialisation of GM crops, 2006-2015, is likely to feature significant growth in Asia, particularly in India and China, James said. The report quotes a US study that found the vast majority of consumers are confident about the safety of US food supply and express little or no concern about crop biotechnology.

 The future (of GM crops) looks good, said James, predicting that the number of farmers around the world planting GM crops would double to 20 million within the next eight years.

 But its a claim challenged by organisations such as Greenpeace which, only hours before the release of the report, had produced its own summary of what it says is growing evidence that farmers, consumers and governments are resisting GM crops.

 Greenpeace said the resistance has intensified since August 2006 when the US government announced that long grain rice in the US had been found contaminated with an unapproved GM rice variety.

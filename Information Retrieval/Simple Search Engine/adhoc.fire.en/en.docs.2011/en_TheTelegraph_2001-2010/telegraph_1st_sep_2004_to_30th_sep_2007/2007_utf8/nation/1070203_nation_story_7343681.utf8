 Penury condition for compassionate jobs

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 The Supreme Court

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: The Supreme Court today reiterated that compassionate employment could be demanded only in cases where the death of an employee leaves his family in penury.

 A bench headed by Justice A.R. Lakshmanan set aside a Punjab and Haryana High Court order, which had directed the Amritsar branch of the State Bank of India to hire the widow of a record assistant. The bank, which rejected the claim as the familys financial condition was not one of destitution, had moved the apex court.

 The bank was free to decide on such applications, the Supreme Court said, adding that the parameters for judging the financial condition include family pension, gratuity and compensation. 

 The apex court had made the same point while delivering another judgment last year. 

 Once it is proved that in spite of the death of the bread-earner, the family survived, there is no necessity to say goodbye to the normal rule of appointment and show favour to one at the cost of interests of several others, ignoring the mandate of Article 14 (equality) of the Constitution, the court had said while setting aside a Jammu and Kashmir High Court order.

 In the recent case, the bench said the object of providing compassionate employment was to help the family get over a sudden financial crisis. But it should not be forgotten that, like the destitute family of the deceased, there are millions and millions of other families which are equally, if not more, destitute, it added.

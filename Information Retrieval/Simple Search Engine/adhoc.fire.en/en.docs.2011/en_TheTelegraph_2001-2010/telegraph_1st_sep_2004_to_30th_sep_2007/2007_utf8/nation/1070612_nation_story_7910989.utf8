 Thank golf, Paras is a gentleman

 Paras: Turning over a new leaf

 Kathmandu, June 11: Where crown prince Paras had failed, citizen Paras seems to have succeeded.

 The wayward Nepal royal, reduced to a commoner with the monarchy stripped of its powers, has finally allowed the refined sport of golf to mellow him into a gentleman.

 At a weekend tournament at the Le Meridien Gokarna Forest Golf Course here, Paras appeared to have accepted his changed status graciously, contesting as an ordinary player and declining special privileges like a golf cart and the choicest tee-off time.

 He, however, requested the tournaments organiser, the Nepal Golf Association, to team him up with close friends, a source said. The friends included a member of the powerful Rana clan and a schoolmate who recently returned from the US with an engineering degree to head Nepals oldest private bank.

 Paras, once known for binges, reckless driving and nightclub brawls, had been introduced to golf in the hope that the genteel surroundings and cultured company would help curb his wild ways.

 But last year, he rode onto the Le Meridien course on his Harley Davidson and zigzagged across its hallowed turf as international diplomats and venerable old gentlemen watched in horror.

 When a leopard was spotted near the greens in January this year, Paras, an enthusiastic hunter, zipped across the adjoining reserve forest on his Japanese dirt bike night after night, armed with a rifle and followed by guards, hangers-on and retainers on golf carts.

 Other than golf, a dose of spiritualism may have helped bring about the change.

 Paras took part in a five-day Spirit of Golf camp organised by the Art of Living foundation last week. 

 He was on his best behaviour and interacted freely with the 25-odd participants, mostly golfers from Nepal, India and Dubai.

 He kept joking about his inability to cope with the yoga postures, a participant said, adding that Paras stuck to the strict regimen of satvic (spiritually pure) food. He stayed away from liquor, but couldnt resist a smoke or two.

 In the tournament, Paras managed to hold his own among the 80 competitors, a source in the newly formed golf association said.

 At first, we were surprised when he signed up for our first-ever tournament. We were worried the Maoists might try to stop the event, he added.

 The Maoists, die-hard opponents of the monarchy, want it abolished. The multi-party government of which they are a part has reduced Parass father, King Gyanendra, to a ceremonial ruler.

 The government is preparing to hold elections to a constituent assembly in November to decide the fate of the monarchy and form of governance.

 The Maoists, who probably see golf as a bourgeois pursuit, had recently got the 100-odd caddies of the Le Meridien course to form a union.

 Parass newfound polish bowled fellow contestants over. Several of them got their pictures taken with him and some gifted him mementoes. The prince took them to his mansion in the Gokarna forests for a drink.

 But Paras, again, stayed away from liquor, which is known to bring out the devil in him.

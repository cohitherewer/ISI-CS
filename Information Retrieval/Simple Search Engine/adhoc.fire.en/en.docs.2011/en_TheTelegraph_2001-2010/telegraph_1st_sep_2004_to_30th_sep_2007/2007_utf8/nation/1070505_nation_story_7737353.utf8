 Oxford, May 4: These days its very hard to win a place at Oxbridge but had Kamal Nath applied for a place yesterday, chances are he would have got in. 

 Just before the commerce and industry minister made an inaugural address at the launch of a trade project by the Global Economic Governance Programme, he was introduced by Lord Butler of Brockwell, Master of University College, Oxford, where the research programme is based. 

 In a previous avatar, Butler, who sits in the House of Lords as a cross-bencher, had been cabinet secretary, the most powerful civil servant in the land. 

 In fact, he had served five Prime Ministers and headed a committee which examined whether the intelligence relating to Iraqs weapons of mass destruction played a key part in the governments decision to invade Iraq (as part of the US-led coalition) in 2003 Tony Blair was cleared. 

 Last night, however, he spoke in the tones of an Oxbridge admissions tutor who had spotted a rather bright sixth former and was determined to wangle a place for him at his own college. 

 There can be no better person to inaugurate this trade project in the Global Economic Governance Programme than Indias minister for commerce and industry, began Butler, who was addressing an audience sitting at desks in the Examinations Schools in High Street this is where generations of undergraduates in formal dress have sat their examinations. 

 The Hon. Kamal Nath has been the innovator, leader and reformer of Indias trade policy since 2004. On the global stage, he has been a key figure in developing his countrys efforts to improve the global trade system, Butler went on. 

 And he added: In his current role he has been admired the world over for his political skills, his global vision and his genuine concern for sustainable development. It is a great privilege to have him here to speak to us this evening.

 Indias commerce and industry minister looked suitably modest like a Calcutta St Xaviers boy who knows he has done well in his admissions interview. 

 It is a privilege and an honour for me to be here in Oxford, an institution that has been hallowed by time and history, he responded. 

 I come from a culture that so values knowledge that it treats seats of learning as places of pilgrimage, he gushed. 

 I come to Oxford with awe, with respect and with pleasure. I come to you to speak of my country and how it engages with the world of commerce, how we perceive the new globalised world, how it perceives us and how we confront the challenges of the new economic architecture. 

 Details of what he said during an hour-long address and the question and answer session that followed, in which he dealt with Indias attempt to improve the lot of her poorest and develop inclusive policies and the countrys attempts to improve the structural flaws in the World Trade Organisation, can be left till another day. 

 Yesterday, in the city of dreaming spires, the MP for Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh, where all but 500,000 of his 1.8 million constituents lived on less than a dollar a day, he was in another, more ethereal, world. 

 It is not just that the worlds perception of India is changing, he said. Indias own perception of herself is changing. How an ancient culture engages with the new economy is one of the fascinating and exciting developments of the past decade. 

 He had been invited by Ngaire Woods, the glamorous director of the Global Economic Governance Programme, a New Zealander who is a fellow in politics and international relations at University College, Oxford. She agreed with much that Kamal Nath had to say, she confided later. At the reception that followed, while the minister mingled with academics and research scholars, Oxfords mix of Indians and non-Indians, The Telegraph suggested to Butler that his introduction had sounded almost like the citation read by Lord Patten, Oxfords chancellor, when conferring an honorary degree on Manmohan Singh in 2005. 

 Kamal Nath might well be a candidate for an honorary degree in the years to come, Butler concurred. I should think so (though) not a decision for me, laughed Butler. But I should have thought so a man of huge stature.

 He emphasised: Hes a man who is of enormous stature. 

 He explained why he had liked Kamal Naths talk: He gave today the aspect which I thought was very important to academics and policy makers, which is not just the theory of trade nor the structure, but how these issues affect ordinary people, people he represents and how it matters to people on the ground to make progress in freeing up and developing trade. That was the aspect which I thought he brought up very clearly and will be very valuable to the project. 

 He explained: The Global Economic Governance project is about the way in which we can fund experience of what works and what doesnt work between the international financial institutions and the world trade institutions in helping developing countries to get rich, what really does free up people in developing countries. 

 When it was drawn to Butlers attention that the television comedy Yes, Minister!, about the relationship between senior civil servants (including the cabinet secretary) and ministers, was exceedingly popular in the corridors of power in India, he laughed again. 

 Yes, I think we have got rather a lot of institutions in common and perhaps we have got rather a lot of traditions in common but I always think about Yes, Minister! that it captures the relationship between politicians and civil servants throughout the world, said Butler. 

 It was translated into 43 different languages and shown very widely throughout the world and an awful lot of people throughout the world identified with it. 

 Kamal Nath was accompanied by his team of senior civil servants.

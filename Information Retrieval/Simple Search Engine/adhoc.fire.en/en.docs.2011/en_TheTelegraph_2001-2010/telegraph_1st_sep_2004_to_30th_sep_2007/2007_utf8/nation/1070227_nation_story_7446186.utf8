 Park dries up, so do the birds

 Bharatpur, Feb. 26 (Reuters): For years, tourists have come to the Keoladeo Ghana National Park to gaze at shimmering, bird-flocked wetlands stretching to the horizon.

 But where there were once vast lakes, visitors now find puddles nursed by a network of stuttering diesel-fuelled pumps, which suck up groundwater from deep beneath the parched earth.

 Years of poor monsoon rains have left most of this world heritage site near Bharatpur in Rajasthan dry and cracked, while local farmers insist on getting most of what little rain water is dammed to irrigate their fields.

 This has forced most of the thousands of migratory birds that would once spectacularly descend on Keoladeo every year for the winter to make alternative arrangements elsewhere.

 Before, the skies were so full of birds it was a wonder they didnt collide into each other, recalled Mahendra Vyas, a lawyer who advises the Supreme Court on conservation issues. Now there is nothing there, he added.

 Although the park has not yet been added to the United Nations danger list, the world heritage committee warned in 2005 that if the park continues to dry up then it risks losing its status as a world heritage site.

 The situation is not good and the prognosis for the future also doesnt appear to be very encouraging, Kishore Rao, the deputy director of the United Nations World Heritage Centre, said over the phone from his Paris office.

 Delisting has not happened before but that doesnt mean it wont happen in the future, said Rao.

 When India succeeded in getting Keoladeo listed as a world heritage site in 1985, it promised to look after the unique wetlands for the benefit of humanity.

 But word is spreading, especially on travel websites, that India is failing in that undertaking. As a result, visitors are showing up in ever smaller numbers, locals say.

 February should be a busy month at the height of the tourist season; but most of the men dozing on their cycle-rickshaws at the park gates are lucky these days to get hired.

 No water, no birds, no tourists, complained Rampal Singh, who says he and his fellow rickshaw drivers are struggling on their reduced earnings. Hoteliers also say bookings are down.

 Inside the park, a handful of foreign tourists cluster around the edge of the largest stretch of pumped water, binoculars trained on kingfishers and other resident birds.

 Their disappointment at the mostly empty skies increased in proportion to the size and cost of their bird-spotting gear.

 German tourist Franziska Freitag, who had stopped off at the park between visits to the nearby Taj Mahal and Jaipur, said she was happy to have seen a python and some very beautiful owls.

 But Leif Jonasson, who had lugged several thousand euros worth of camera equipment from Sweden, said he was saddened to find that bleak reports of the parks deterioration were true. 

 Its a pity to see these small puddles. Theyre like peas in an ocean. 

 Rajasthans forestry department thinks the best solution is to top up the park with water piped in from the Chambal river, about 80 km away, or from the Goverdhan floodwater drain, about 20 km away.

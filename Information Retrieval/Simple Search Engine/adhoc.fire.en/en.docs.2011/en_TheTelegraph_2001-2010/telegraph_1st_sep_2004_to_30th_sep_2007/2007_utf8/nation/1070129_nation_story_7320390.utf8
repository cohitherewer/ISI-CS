 Wanted: monkey home

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 28: Three thousand monkeys trapped by municipal officials of Delhi are struggling to find a home where they are wanted.

 Enjoying the freedom of Delhis roads till a few months back, the simians were picked up by civic officials after a spate of complaints of citizens being attacked.

 That is where the problem should have ended for the Delhi government. But thats where it started.

 The only primate shelter in the capital, at Rajokri near Gurgaon, has a capacity of only 300. With 3,300 monkeys in the same space, the residents fight with each other for space. We cant control them any more, said Ravi Kulkarni, an animal trainer at the Rajokri facility.

 The government has been trying its best to sell the monkeys to other states. But Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan have refused Delhis offers, Anil Gupta, deputy director of the monkey trapping programme, said. We are still negotiating rates with Uttar Pradesh. We hope they agree.

 Madhya Pradesh, it seems, has had enough of Delhis monkeys. The Supreme Court, in June 2004, had ordered the Madhya Pradesh government to adopt 300 of Delhis monkeys. The Delhi government was asked to pay Rs 25,000 for the rehabilitation. The money, Bhopal has alleged, never reached it.

 So when a second batch of monkeys was sanctioned to be sent in October 2006, Madhya Pradesh responded by sending the Delhi government a bill of Rs 25,000, while informing the court that it did not wish to adopt more primates.

 One solution Gupta proposes is for animal rights activists, who complain about the conditions we keep the animals in, to simply adopt the monkeys.

 Instead of attacking animal rights activists, the government would do better to build more shelters, said Sunidhi Dixit from the People for Ethical Treatment of Animals.

 Two more shelters have been planned on the citys outskirts. They will house a thousand monkeys, Delhi environment secretary J.K. Dadoo said. But they will take time to build. We will also have to recruit people to run them.

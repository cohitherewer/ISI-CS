 Fake visas

 New Delhi, April 24 (PTI): Thirty-nine Indians, who went to Dubai on fake visas looking for jobs, today returned after being deported by the UAE immigration authorities.

 The majority of them are from Chandigarh and the first batch of 36 arrived on a Dubai-Delhi Indian flight this morning. The second batch of three came on another flight later.

 The men were detained at the Dubai international airport after they were found to be carrying fake visas issued by rogue travel agents.

 Bhopal minister logs a first 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Jan. 19: Madhya Pradesh minister of water resources Jugal Kishore Bagri and BJP MP Ganesh Singh became the first public representatives to face criminal prosecution without prior government sanction, in line with a Supreme Court judgment that said such clearances were not necessary for court action.

 The duo was chargesheeted yesterday by the Madhya Pradesh Lok Ayukta in a nine-year-old teacher appointment scam in Satna district. Bagri quit this morning after a nudge from the chief minister.

 In accordance with the ideals of my party, I take moral responsibility of the chargesheet and voluntarily resign from my post, Bagri said.

 On December 6, the apex court had ruled that a public servant can be prosecuted for cheating, forgery, entering into criminal conspiracy and other penal offences not connected with the discharge of official duties without sanction from the government. 

 Bagri and Ganesh Singh had escaped trial so far as the then MP Assembly speaker Srinivas Tiwari hadnt given his sanction to prosecute them. 

 The case dates back to 1998 when Bagri was an MLA and a co-opted member of a teacher selection committee. Ganesh Singh was the chairman. 

 The special police establishment of the Lokayukta found Bagris daughter had been picked as a Grade I schoolteacher in violation of procedures. 

 The duo was also alleged to have selected general candidates against posts reserved for the physically challenged and women.

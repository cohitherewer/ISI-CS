 Giani daughter eyes poll fray

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Giani Zail Singh

 Chandigarh, Jan. 3: He never allowed his four children a shot at politics when he was in power. They never did, as long as he was alive.

 But now, 12 years after the death of former President Giani Zail Singh, one his daughters, Manjit Kaur, has shed the doctors white robes to stake claim to a Congress ticket from the Ludhiana (rural) Assembly seat in the February 13 poll.

 There was no one looking after the interests of the Ramgharia community after my father. I want to work not only for them, but also for all people of the state. I want to fulfil the dreams that my father could not in his lifetime, Manjit said over phone from Ludhiana. 

 Manjit has sought a premature end to her service as a senior medical officer at the local Lord Mahavira Civil Hospital to make time for her new quest in life. 

 I still had two years of service but had to quit to take part in elections, she said. Manjit is embroiled in a blood bank scam at the hospital along with five others, but she denies the charges. It is an old matter and I have nothing to do with it. I am clean and the probe is over.

 Surprised at Manjits claim to the Ludhiana seat, a Congress spokesman said it was too early to take a decision. 

 The seats have not been finalised. Amarinder (the Punjab chief minister) is not here. We cant be sure that Manjit will be our candidate. There are many other claimants to the seat, the spokesman said.

 The constituency is now represented by Malkit Singh Birmi, who was once close to the chief minister but was unceremoniously removed as chief parliamentary secretary last year. 

 Manjits sister, Gurdeep, who also lives in Chandigarh, was surprised at her siblings plans to enter the electoral fray. Its a personal decision. I cant say anything, she said.

 Former vice-chairman of the Minorities Commission and a now a Rajya Sabha member, Tarlochan Singh, was also taken aback. 

 Gianiji never allowed his children to step into politics. He kept them away, gave them good education and made them self-reliant. He never wanted his children to step into politics. Never encouraged them. Manjits decision is a shocker, Singh, a close confidant of the former President, said over phone from Delhi.

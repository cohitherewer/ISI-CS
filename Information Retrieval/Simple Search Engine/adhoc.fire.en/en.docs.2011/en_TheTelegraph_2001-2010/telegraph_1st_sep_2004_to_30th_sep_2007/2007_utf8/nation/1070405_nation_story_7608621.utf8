 Bangalore, April 4: A.K.N. Prasad, the head of Indian operations of Cirrus Electronics, has gone underground after being indicted with some others for shipping closely-guarded US computer technology to India for use in missiles and weapons systems.

 Door No. 303 of the companys Bangalore office, on the third floor of a commercial complex in Jayanagar II block, has been shut for the past two days. On the wall beside the door is the legend Cirrus Electronics Marketing (P) Ltd.

 Security guards at the building told The Telegraph that two men and two women worked in the 850-sq-ft office between 9.30 am and 6 pm every day.

 Yesterday nobody came here. This morning, they came at 8 am and left shortly after. They told us they would come back by noon. They have still not come, a guard said.

 Cirrus founder Parthasarathy Sudarshan, who was arrested in south Carolina on March 23, yesterday appeared before a Columbia court for the first time. The 46-year-old is in federal custody and faces between eight and 10 years in prison if convicted.

 Mythili Gopal, the companys 36-year-old international sales manager, was also arrested but released after a court appearance. She is due to appear again on April 7 and could be jailed for five to seven-and-a-half years if convicted.

 Prasad, who works from this Bangalore office, and Sampath Sundar, the companys operations director working out of Singapore, have also been indicted by US courts. 

 Sources said Prasads lawyer told him not to show up at the Bangalore office while there was uncertainty on how an Indian citizen accused in the US would stand trial there.

 Prasad, 62, a former employee of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, was coordinating from here to ship in technology that is commercially available but whose exports are governed by US laws.

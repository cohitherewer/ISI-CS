 New Delhi/Chandigarh, Feb. 21: Sleuths have stumbled upon more phone conversations on the Samjhauta Express fire that strengthens the case against terror groups operating from Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

 Yesterday, home ministry sources said investigating agencies had intercepted mobile calls made after the blasts from Delhi to Pakistan and the two Kashmirs.

 Based on the conversations, the Intelligence Bureau and Delhi polices special cell have sent a number of teams to Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Investigating agencies in Kashmir have been briefed.

 Sources said it is now certain that the five suitcases and chemicals (sulphuric acid, potassium nitrate, kerosene and petrol) which the terrorists used to spark the fire were purchased from markets close to old Delhi railway station.

 While the chemicals were bought from Indira Market, located in Old Subzi Mandi in old Delhi, the suitcases were bought from a shop in Delhis Chandni Chowk market. The identity of the persons who bought the suitcases is being established.

 The railways, especially the Railway Protection Force, are facing flak for not having closed-circuit televisions in proper working condition at old Delhi station and on platform 18 from where the train leaves.

 Had the CCTVs been in good working condition and had recording facility, we could have got vital clues from the footage. It would have helped us to close in on those who planted the bombs, a Delhi police officer said.

 An RPF officer said the force had moved the proposal for new CCTVs several times but had not been given funds.

 Finally, the railway board is seriously thinking of releasing funds to beef up security at key stations and platforms, he said.

 Pak witness

 Pakistani national, Usman Mohammed, who was detained yesterday for questioning by Haryana police, will be a prosecution witness in the blasts case.

 Usman was handed over to Pakistan embassy officials today. He told a Panipat magistrate that he saw four persons jump off the train as it slowed down in Sonepat some 15 minutes before the blast.

 He was detained on complaints by passengers that he threw a suitcase containing an IED out of the train when it stopped at Deewana.

 In a six-page statement, he said he had opened the suitcase and found bottles full of chemicals inside. When he saw the police, he hurled the suitcase out in confusion. 

 Usman may have been in an inebriated state. But the sight of the fire and the shrieks of women, men and children made him strong enough to be of use for investigations, a Haryana police officer said.

 Police sources said Usman vividly recounted the time he had spent in the compartment and gave details about the persons he said had jumped off the train.

 We questioned him thoroughly before handing him over to enable him to go back to Pakistan, an officer said.

 A meeting between Union home minister Shivraj Patil and his railway counterpart Lalu Prasad to discuss security on trains and in stations is on the cards.

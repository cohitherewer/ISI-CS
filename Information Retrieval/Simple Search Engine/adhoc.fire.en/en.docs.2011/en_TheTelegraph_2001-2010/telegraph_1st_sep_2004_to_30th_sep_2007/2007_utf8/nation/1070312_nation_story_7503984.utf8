 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 This ones hardly monkey business

A wave of simian sympathy is sweeping Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR). The high court has been promised that monkeys being shifted to a sanctuary on the citys outskirts will have more than just a new home.

 Not all people get too much out of state budgets, but the NCR government will ensure that hungry monkeys are luckier. 

 There is budgetary support for monkeys and two persons will be deputed to ensure that they get food and water, the Delhi governments lawyer told a bench of Justice Swatanter Kumar and Justice H.R. Malhotra.

 The jury was concerned about the fate of the monkeys, saying they had to make do with food offered by devotees. That, too, came through only on Saturdays and Tuesdays, when devotees thronging Hanuman temples get generous. On other days, they fend for themselves.

 Food-collection will soon come up at shrines and advertisements in newspapers will urge people to use this facility so that food can reach the new simian shelter.

 The Bhati Mines Sanctuary had been hosting 125 new inmates till last week. Besides food, they were given healthcare that still remains out of reach for many Indians.

 Play the Ash card right

Mumbai might have got tired of hearing about Ash, but down south, the former Miss Worlds name spells big money.

 Weary of Abhi-Ash stories? Get back to the true-blue Aishwarya or, better still, check out the new IB Aishwarya Card. Actually, its the name of a credit plan the city-based Indian Bank launched on Womens Day last week.

 Under this scheme, up to Rs 1 lakh is lent to women between 18 and 50 years of age to set up a small business. Working women are eligible, too. 

 However, the beneficiaries should be those not covered under the student loan scheme. 

 The money borrowed, at an interest rate of 12 per cent, can be repaid in four years, but at least one of the girls parents must stand as a guarantor.

 Night riders make a mark

Want to play it safe while cheating through exams? Do it after the tests, as the examiner sleeps. Three class XI boys of Poorna Pragya Public School in South Delhis Vasant Kunj did just that, in possibly the most bizarre case of cheating the capital has seen in recent times.

 Fearing they might fail in their year-end Physics paper, the three 16-year olds police are not naming them because their careers will be ruined broke into the school the night on March 1. They had help, too. A carpenter broke open the safe where the answer scripts were kept.

 In all, 34 answer scripts (the entire class) were stolen, deputy commissioner of police (south), Anil Shukla, said.

 The boys escaped to a nearby alley where, while making necessary corrections, they were spotted by a night patrol team. The have been charged with theft, but got bail so that they can sit for their remaining papers.

 Womens song

Last week, as some Womens Day celebrations turned shrill, there was one young lady who pitched it just right in Mumbai.

 Shreya Ghoshal, the crooner of many chart-busters in recent years, delivered another memorable number. But this was no ordinary song it had been made especially for Womens Day. Renukaji (Choudhary) requested me to compose the song for the occasion, said Aadesh Srivastava, who set the song to tune. The number Hum ko bhi aage badhna hain, aage badho, badhte chalo, apna itihaas badalna hainHum ko bhi is being used in an especially shot video being aired on channels.

Bangalore: If you are an Iron Maiden fan and are in Bangalore on March 17, Palace grounds is where you should be. The iconic rock band is performing here for the first time in India.

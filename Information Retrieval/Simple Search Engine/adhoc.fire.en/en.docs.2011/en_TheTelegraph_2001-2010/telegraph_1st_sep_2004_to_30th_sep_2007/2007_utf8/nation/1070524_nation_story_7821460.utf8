 Poor tech student ends life

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, May 23: A Junagadh engineering college student killed himself, apparently because of financial problems.

 Sanjay Panchani was found hanging from the ceiling fan of his hostel room at Junagadhs Agriculture Engineering College today. But police arent sure whether that alone was the trigger, though a suicide note cites his familys cash woes as the reason.

 No one should be blamed for my death. I do not want to live and become a financial burden on my family, the 23-year-old wrote in the three-page note found in his pocket.

 While the note, addressed to his parents and other close relatives, speaks of the familys poor financial condition, investigating officer K.A. Parmar is not sure why Sanjay, said to be good at studies, ended his life.

 Parmar, who has already met Sanjays family, said they appeared to be well-to-do.

 The officer claimed that Sanjays father had no clue that his son, who had a job offer from a private company, would take such a dire step. His friends at the university have not been quizzed so far.

 In the note, Sanjay, who came from a village near Gondal town, has asked his younger brother to forgive him for not being able to pursue his studies. He also regretted wasting the hard-earned money of his father.

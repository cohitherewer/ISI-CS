 Caned comrades at pains to behave

 Vijayan (top) and Achuthanandan: Playing safe 

 Thiruvananthapuram, May 27: Princy Prakash Karats stick has whipped the self-confessed problem children to the straight and the narrow, at least in public.

 Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan and state CPM secretary Pinarayi Vijayan today sheepishly regretted their mistakes and behaved well. Vijayan made sure to point out that the party had raised its prestige by suspending them from the politburo yesterday.

 Achuthanandan was the first to express penitence. I accept the party decision wholeheartedly. Such ups and downs happen in public life. At times, as we strive to work for the people and the state, mistakes do happen. For us, the party is like our parents or teachers, who punish when their wards commit mistakes. It is part of the correction process, the 84-year-old veteran said on the sidelines of a conference.

 The chief minister was mum when he returned here late last night from Delhi. But this morning, asked if his suspension from the CPM politburo was because of prolonged infighting in the partys state unit, Achuthanandan replied that the action was taken for issuing public statements. We aired our differences openly on the basis of what appeared in newspapers.

 If Achuthanandan was regretful, Vijayan was contrite. But both leaders wanted to clarify that the punishment had been meted out for their open statements rather than for leading internecine battles.

 Vijayan, who yesterday scolded a reporter for asking questions, opened up at a party meeting in northern Kerala.

 Ive never encountered any action for indiscipline in the party. So when some action is taken, one is pained by it. But here, more than the pain one feels, the politburos action raises the prestige of the party, he said amid applause from party workers. 

 This is a lesson for all. Knowing the party well, I am sure this will do immense good for the organisation. The politburos message is that it will not spare anyone, however big they are, if they violate party discipline.

 But Vijayan cautioned the cadre on discipline. The party will not brook detractions from its organisational principles, he said. 

 Vijayan has embarrassing times ahead. He will have to face questions from the cadre during meetings scheduled in August in the run-up to the annual state party conference.

 Party workers have already been asking how he will preach discipline when he himself has been punished for indiscipline.

 For Achuthanandan, the action comes at a time when he is preparing to take on the Tatas for alleged encroachment in the Munnar hill station.

 A special task force is expected to issue a notice tomorrow citing a 0.75-km stretch along the Kochi-Madurai highway where tea has been planted allegedly in violation of leasehold rights. The Tatas have nearly 56,000 acres in Munnar.

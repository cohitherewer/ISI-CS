 Cruise claims school kids

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Thiruvananthapuram, Feb. 20: Eighteen school students and four teachers of a picnic party died this evening in one of the worst boat mishaps in Kerala.

 The boat capsized in a reservoir of the Periyar river, about 70 km from Kochi, around 6.30 pm.

 More than 100 students all aged below 10 and teachers of St Antonys School at Elavoor near Angamaly set out on an evening cruise on the most scenic stretch of the Periyar between the Boothathankettu reservoir and the Thattekkat bird sanctuary.

 Witnesses said over 50 children were rescued.

 Indian Navy and Kerala fire brigade personnel were still searching for more than 15 students and teachers. The group was in two boats.

 The death toll is likely to go up as the ill-fated boat was caught in a strong current in a remote stretch of the river, making rescue efforts extremely difficult. 

 Overcrowding could be the reason for the capsize. The boat had only three crew members and lacked safety gear, sources said.

 In 2002, 29 people had died in a ferry capsize in the Kumarakom backwaters in Alappuzha district. But the worst disaster in the backwaters was the Perumon tragedy.

 At least 100 people were killed when several coaches of the Island Express sank in the Ashtamudi Lake tributary near Kollam district in the 80s.

 Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan, who is on a four-day visit to New Delhi, will leave for the state tomorrow and visit the accident site.

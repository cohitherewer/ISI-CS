 Students cling to IIM dream

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI AND CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE

 Smooth then, now...: CAT candidates in 2005

 New Delhi/ Calcutta, April 13: Shocked and betrayed, Saurabh Das was preparing for the ultimate switch in loyalties from a dream he has cherished for 10 years to a future he never considered. 

 A flick on the remote and his dream was back on the road to being realised. 

 The 24-year-old has wanted to enter an Indian institute of management since he was 14. For the last four years, he has spent every day preparing for the entrance examination.

 Confidently waiting for a letter with the IIM stamp, Saurabh says he felt betrayed by the Centres diktat to keep the final list of successful IIM candidates on hold.

 My dream was suddenly rocked. I realised other B-schools would be out with their results by end-April. The Supreme Court hearing is in August, and I would have had no choice but to go to an inferior institute, he said. 

 Thats when IIM Ahmedabad director Bakul Dholakia appeared on his television screen with the assurance that general category results would be declared by April 21. 

 However, the twists and turns in this years admission process have made the Calcutta boy wary. He is still not fully convinced that the results will be out on April 21.

 The last date for submitting the fees for most of the other second-rung B-schools is after April 21. If the (IIM) results do come out by then, Ill join an IIM, Saurabh said.

 Other IIM aspirants are willing to give their dreams time as well, but only till the end of the month. April 28, 29, and 30 are the last dates for submitting fees in most other second-rung schools. If the (IIM) results arent out by then, well have to go elsewhere, said Deepak Razdan, a final year student at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. 

 The fear of brain drain to other institutes was one of the reasons the IIMs decided to draw the line on how long they were willing to wait before declaring the final results.

 Mehul Aggarwal, a BCom Honours student at St Xaviers College in Calcutta, was the city topper in the common admission test. He got a call from all five IIMs, but thinks he might not end up in any.

 I have my Part II examination from April 23. This (the IIM admission row) is always at the back of my mind and I am not able to concentrate, he said. 

 Mehul also pointed out that students have to keep costs in mind. In most of the other institutes, the initial advance is partially non-refundable and it is nothing less than Rs 30,000. We will have to take admission to other institutes as we cant solely depend on the IIMs, he said. 

 Mehuls college mate Rohit Goenka echoes him.

 The institutes which will teach us to be the best managers are not being able to manage time properly. We dont even know whether it will be out by 21st or not.

 The OBC applicants, on the other hand, feel they are being left in the lurch. 

 Politics is being played over our future, said 24-year-old Rajesh Kumar, an OBC candidate in Delhi.

 Indira loyalist back in CWC

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 R.K. Dhawan

 New Delhi, June 19: Shivraj Patil, Arjun Singh and Motilal Vora unquestioned Nehru-Gandhi loyalists all lost out in the race to the Presidents post, but family retainer R.K. Dhawan has been brought out of the woodwork.

 Dhawan was today inducted into the Congress Working Committee as a permanent invitee and put in charge of Himachal Pradesh, which goes to the polls in this year.

 The staff at the Congress headquarters promptly removed Ambika Sonis nameplate from the room she was allotted as general secretary. Soni was in charge of Himachal and Jammu and Kashmir and remained so even after she became a minister in 2006. 

 The Congress staff, however, left untouched the nameplate on the door of Ambikas neighbour in the party office, A.K. Antony. Like her, Antony had continued to be in charge of Karnataka even after taking over as defence minister. The responsibility has been passed on to M.M. Jacob, who was Meghalaya governor till recently and was today inducted into the working committee.

 But because Antony is seen as close to 10 Janpath and a rising star in the government who has Sonia Gandhis and Manmohan Singhs ears, his room was spared. 

 Dhawan, who was Indira Gandhis personal secretary and fiercely loyal, hit a rough patch after her assassination when the Thakkar Commission, which investigated the incident, famously spoke of the needle of suspicion pointing towards insiders. 

 Rajiv Gandhi later rehabilitated him and made him a minister. 

 Dhawan re-affirmed his allegiance when Sonia was attacked by Sharad Pawar and others for her foreign origin. 

 In the internal meetings of the time, he is said to have been the only one to question Pawar.

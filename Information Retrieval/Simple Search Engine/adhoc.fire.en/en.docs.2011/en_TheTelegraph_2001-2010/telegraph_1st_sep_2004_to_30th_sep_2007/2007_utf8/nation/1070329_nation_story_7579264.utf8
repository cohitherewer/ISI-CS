 Coupons to choose school

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 28: The Centre for Civil Society, an NGO that focuses on education, today launched a school voucher system which provides low-income parents in the capital the choice between a government school and a private one.

 The plan, opposed by many, seeks to test the ground for the new system, under which the government issues parents a coupon that they can submit to a school of their choice.

 No money changes hands. The voucher only moves from students to the school and back to the government, said an NGO official. To start with, the project will cover 400 slum children, whose parents will be given a coupon of Rs 300 each but only those who do not want to send their children to government schools.

 The vouchers can be used for admissions to the second, third, fourth and sixth standards from the 2007-08 academic year. 

 Those in favour of the new system say it will force government schools to be more competitive which, in turn, will lead to an improvement in the quality of education. At present, low-income parents have no choice other than sending kids to government schools, often blamed for teaching standards so poor that they are losing an increasing number of students to private schools.

 Those opposing the voucher system fear it will undermine the primacy of government schools. They argue the quality of teaching is not necessarily better in run-of-the-mill private schools. Some education experts believe that the mere presence of teachers in a classroom isnt a guarantee for quality education. 

 The money for the Centre for Civil Society project has come from voluntary organisations and individuals. There is a lot of criticism that a voucher system will end government schools. But we arent asking the government to stop funding its schools. We are only saying it shouldnt make additional investments because the system isnt working, says the NGOs Parth J. Shah.

 Shah says he will try to sell the idea to politicians campaigning for Delhis civic polls, though the human resource development ministry has turned down the proposal. 

 The Planning Commission was in favour of it. Its draft to the eleventh plan suggested that the possibility of starting vouchers could be explored. The ministry, however, had its way. The idea was dropped in the final plan.

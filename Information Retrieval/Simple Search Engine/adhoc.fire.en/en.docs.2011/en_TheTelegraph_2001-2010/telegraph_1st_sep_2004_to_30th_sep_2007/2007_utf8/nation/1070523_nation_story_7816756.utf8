 Centre mulls House leash on IIMs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 22: The Centre is planning to tighten the leash on Indian institutes of management by making them accountable to Parliament.

 Government sources said the idea behind bringing the IIMs under an act of Parliament was to monitor them more strictly. The act will be modelled on the lines of that governing the Indian institutes of technology.

 The move appears to have been spurred by the recent stand-off between the Centre and the IIMs over announcement of admission results.

 The IIMs may have cause to worry at least financially if the IIT act is replicated. The IIMs would then have to park their revenue in the governments consolidated fund.

 The IIMs are now governed by memoranda of association drawn up separately between each business school and the Centre. They are allowed to build a corpus of their own from the revenue they earn.

 The three top IIMs Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta have a corpus between Rs 70 and Rs 90 crore. 

 The Centre uses money from the consolidated fund for any sector it pleases, not necessarily education or health. This means the revenue earned by business schools could be used for other sectors.

 The bigger fear is the IIMs might lose their financial autonomy. They are now exempt from parking money in the consolidated fund by special permission from the cabinet.

 A rule, however, bars them from maintaining a corpus of over Rs 50 crore at any given time. The IIMs are expected to invest extra money in building infrastructure.

 The IIT councils, as mandated by Parliament, have to include two MPs. The IIMs may have to do the same.

 A section of policy-makers is hoping the act that is being put together will clear any confusion on what constitutes autonomy.

 The Centre has said it has no intention of meddling in the IIMs academic freedom. But the institutes cannot claim to be exempt from administrative rules.

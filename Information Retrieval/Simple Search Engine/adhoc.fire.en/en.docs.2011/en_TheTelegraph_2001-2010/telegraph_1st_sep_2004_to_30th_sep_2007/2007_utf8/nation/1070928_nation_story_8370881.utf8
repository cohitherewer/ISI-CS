 Valley fury in uniform

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Sept. 27: Soldiers beat up six policemen, critically wounding an officer, and a CRPF jawan killed a farmer in the Valley in separate incidents last evening.

 Army personnel from 33 Rashtriya Rifles stormed the Magam police post in Handwara, ransacked the place and thrashed the policemen present.

 The soldiers were apparently angered by police action against some of their colleagues who were allegedly caught selling army kerosene illegally in a nearby village. The army denied the allegation.

 Deputy inspector-general (north Kashmir) B. Srinivas said a case had been registered against the army personnel and investigations were under way. 

 Farmer Bilal Bhats death occurred in a Pulwama village where the CRPF men, angry at being refused free apples, allegedly barged into homes and beat up people last evening. When an angry crowd gathered, the jawans opened fire in panic, killing the 28-year-old.

 Left push for SEZ rethink

 A Punjab farmer protests land acquisition for an SEZ 

New Delhi, March 20: The CPM has sought a review of formal approvals given to SEZs so far and suggested changes in policy, including limiting takeover of multi-crop land, not granting land ownership to private developers and asking that SEZs larger than 2,000 hectares should be developed by the state or the Centre. 

 The suggestions, made in a note dated February 23 to the parliamentary standing committee on commerce, came even as violence was brewing in Nandigram where the Bengal government has since dropped plans for a chemical SEZ.

 It is the proliferation of SEZ proposals which has already discredited the SEZ policy and given rise to genuine concerns related to unplanned and imbalanced regional development, large-scale acquisition of fertile farmlands, massive displacement, enormous loss of tax revenue, needless government subsidies to corporates and gross misuse of SEZ land for real estate, it said.

 The note, which has already been taken up by the standing committee, also attacks the 237 SEZs that have been cleared by the Centre. 

 Out of the formal approvals granted till date, no fresh land acquisition has taken place since land already available with state governments or private companies has been utilised for the purpose. 

 This clearly shows most of these projects were about to come up anyway and the SEZ Act has been used to avail tax incentives which would not otherwise have accrued to these projects. The apprehension of industrial projects in the pipeline being converted into SEZ projects overnight has actually come true. 

 If no land has been acquired for the 237 SEZ projects that have been cleared, then it stands to reason that land had been acquired for the projects before the SEZ policy was first drafted in 2000, the CPM is insinuating. When it became evident that an SEZ policy was coming, they mothballed their proposals and decided to wait for it to evolve so that they could cream the tax benefits.

 One of the biggest criticisms about the SEZ projects is that industry wants to hog the tax benefits that the SEZ policy affords. Under the policy, SEZs are entitled to a 15-year tax holiday: this is broken into five-year slabs. In the first five years, there will be no tax. In the second slab (6-10 years), 50 per cent of the tax will be waived. In the last slab (11-15 years), the tax waiver will be 50 per cent of the profits ploughed back into the SEZ.

 Nowhere else in the country is such a tax break offered except to some infrastructure projects. As a result, there is a mad rush to set up SEZ projects to get the tax benefits.

 The note suggests that the SEZ policy should be amended so that it makes it mandatory that no land ownership is transferred to private developers. They should instead be given land on lease. 

 Land is being acquired by the state and handed over to private developers if private entities are allowed to own such huge tracts of land, it would amount to re-establishment of the zamindari system. 

 It also suggests that a ceiling of 2,000 hectares be set for SEZs larger SEZs could be developed only by state or central governments or PSUs. 

 The note, the second to be sent by the CPM to the Centre on the subject, states that acquisition of multi-crop land should be limited. 

 Earlier, the party had recommended that acquisition of farmland should be discouraged. But CPM-ruled Bengal, the state with the most fertile land, has already acquired multi-crop land for the Tata car project and the party cannot now oppose such takeovers outright.

 Close shave for Periyar backer

 Weeks before his June 3 birthday, M. Karunanidhi cant help remembering his days as a staunch Periyar follower.

 One anecdote he recounts dates back to 1973 when, as a young chief minister, he was invited to an Allahabad rally organised by Raj Narayan, a protg of Jayaprakash Narayan. 

 When he arrived, the DMK chief found the town full of posters that screamed Ramarukku Virodhi (enemy of Lord Ram) is coming. That was hardly the reception a leader from the south should have received even if one stood fiercely by the ideals of Periyar in a north Indian town. Periyar believed that the Ramayan was a work of fiction, but praised Ravan as he was a Dravidian.

 worried Raj Narayan strode up the dais when Karunanidhi began to speak and stood behind him like a watch tower. But, with his wits about him, the DMK leader managed to win over the crowd with the first line: I am not Lord Rams enemy. That honour is Ravans. In no time, he had the uneasy crowd in splits.

 Flee slur on senior cop

 His colleagues were struggling to rein in the charging mobs after the May 18 blasts, but one top cop is accused of deserting his men just when the trouble was getting out of hand.

 Assistant commissioner of police A.K. Dubey, deputed with a composite platoon of Andhra Pradesh special police and the CISF, was missing when the mob stormed into Rein Bazaar and started hurling stones.

 City police commissioner Balwinder Singh has issued Dubey a memo. The officer had left his forces when the mob from Mecca Masjid trooped in, Singh said. 

 The action against Dubey comes at a time when the polices mob-control strategies are paying off. Last week, riot-control squads ploughed through mobs and separated them. This left few protesters in the rows behind, prompting the group leading the charge to retreat.

 Unaware of VIP Salem

 Those on the Golden Temple Mail from Mumbai had an unusual co-passenger last week. But they were not aware of the VIP until a couple of hours into the journey.

 The special passenger, Abu Salem, was being brought to Delhi for a court appearance. Many in the coach realised the don was among them only when scores of media crew tried to catch a glimpse of him at stations on the way.

 But there was hardly any fuss. Nothing unusual happened during the journey. Men from Maharashtra polices anti-terrorist squad escorting Salem were very cooperative. They didnt trouble us at all, a passenger said.

 However, Viswajit Chakrabarti, the pantry car attendant, took back something to remember. 

 Kya Chhotu, mujhe chai pilaoge (Chotu, will you give me tea)? the don asked. 

 Viswajit, more than happy to oblige, served him a vegetarian meal of rice, dal and paratha. 

 Cool comfort

 This Sunday, Delhi got a respite from the searing summer heat.

 Overnight rains that caused a mercury dip sent heat-weary Delhiites flocking to the India Gate lawns, Purana Qila grounds and Appu Ghar. It isnt often that crowds pack these hangout zones at this time of the year.

 The weatherman put the maximum temperature at 37.5 Celsius, a good four degrees below normal. Anything below the fiery forties is a relief. The minimum was 21.7 Celsius, six degrees below normal.

 Along with the comforting numbers came another piece of good news: the possibility of rain or sharp showers this week.

 Chennai: An evening of pleasure awaits lovers of classical dance. Soundarya, a disciple of renowned Bharatnatyam exponent Chitra Visweswaran, will present her debut performance (called Arangetram in Tamil) at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Hall in Mylapore on May 30. Time: 6 pm.

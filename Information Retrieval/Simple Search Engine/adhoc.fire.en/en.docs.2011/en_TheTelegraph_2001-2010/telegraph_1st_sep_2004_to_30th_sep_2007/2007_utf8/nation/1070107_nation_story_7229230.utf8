 Border talks with China

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 6: India and China will get back to the negotiating table later this month to find a solution to the boundary question, which had flared up recently when Beijing staked claim to Arunachal Pradesh.

 Two special representatives appointed by the neighbours to resolve the issue are likely to hold talks in Delhi.

 Officials said the dates of the visit of the Chinese representative, vice-foreign minister Dai Bingguo, were being worked out. He is likely to meet his Indian counterpart, national security adviser M.K. Narayanan, for the talks.

 The meeting will take place in the backdrop of Chinese ambassador Sun Yuxis statement on Arunachal Pradesh made just ahead of President Hu Jintaos visit to Delhi in November.

 India had lodged a strong protest with Beijing over the envoys remark but did not let it overshadow Hus visit.

 The special representatives would seek to finalise a framework for a settlement package covering all sectors of the India-China boundary, the officials said.

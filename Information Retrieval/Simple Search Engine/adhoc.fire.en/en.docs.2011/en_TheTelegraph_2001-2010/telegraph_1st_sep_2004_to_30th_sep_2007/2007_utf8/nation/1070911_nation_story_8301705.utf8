 Ex-judge slams nuke deal 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: A former Supreme Court judge today said a government decision to strike a nuclear deal with the US without the consent of Parliament would be unconstitutional and undemocratic.

 Justice P.B. Sawant cited Articles 53, 73 and 253 of the Constitution to argue that the executive needed to get Parliaments sanction for any binding treaty.

 Sawant said that as a quick solution to the debate on the deal, MPs could pass a law that no treaty or agreement on any subject would ever be binding unless it was ratified by Parliament.

 If you have a majority, then members of Parliament could thus safeguard the rights of the people, he told a convention on the 123 Agreement attended by political leaders, foreign policy experts and scientists. 

 A former career diplomat and two scientists also told the convention the nuclear deal would steer India into a path from which it would be difficult to withdraw in the future.

 Indias overall performance would be under scrutiny. Year after year, certification would be made by the US President, said M.K. Bhadrakumar, a former ambassador.

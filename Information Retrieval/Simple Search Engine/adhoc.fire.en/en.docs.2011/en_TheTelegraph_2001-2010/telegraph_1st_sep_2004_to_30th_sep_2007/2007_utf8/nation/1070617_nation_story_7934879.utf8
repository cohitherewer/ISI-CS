 Study on Tata impact in Singur

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 16: The Bengal government has initiated a study on the impact of the proposed Tata Motors car plant in Singur.

 Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen said the study would identify how Singurs socio-economic condition would change after the plant came up. 

 We have appointed an agency to carry out the survey, he said at an informal meeting organised by Bengal Initiative today.

 Sen said he was worried about two things: marginal farmers who had not got much compensation and management of funds received as compensation. The Jindal model of investing half the compensation in annuity schemes is good but only if people accept it.

 Sen admitted that many were worried the land acquisition would harm their lives and livelihood, though the panchayat poll results were proof that more people were in favour of industrialisation.

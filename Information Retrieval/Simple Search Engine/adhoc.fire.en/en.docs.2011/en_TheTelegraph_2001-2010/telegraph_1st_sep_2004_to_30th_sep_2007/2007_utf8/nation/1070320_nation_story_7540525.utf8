 Spotlight on bad hormone build-up in Bob 

 G.S. MUDUR

New Delhi, March 19: Stress triggered by Pakistans shock loss to Ireland in the World Cup may have precipitated a fatal cardiovascular event in coach Bob Woolmer yesterday, medical scientists speculate.

 While the cause of death is expected to become clear only after an autopsy, doctors say acute stress events are known to trigger physiological changes which can culminate in fatal heart attacks or strokes.

 Chronic or even acute stress can be harmful in multiple ways, said Subhash Manchanda, a senior consultant at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi. He has spent decades studying the impact of stress on the human body. 

 Theres now strong evidence that stress leads to excess build up of what we call bad hormones, Manchanda told The Telegraph. 

 The biochemical changes associated with acute stress may lead to a rupture of fat deposits in blood vessels which may cause life-threatening blood clots, he said. Stress may also cause a rise in blood pressure, trigger irregular heartbeats, or constrict blood vessels and decrease blood supply to the heart. 

 Some medical studies estimate that stress may be responsible for one-fifth of fatal heart attacks. 

 Most cardiologists have seen patients whove suffered a heart attack after an intense stress event such as loss of temper or a loss in business, Manchanda said.

 Stress-triggered rise in blood pressure may also lead to stroke, said Prashant Joshi, at the Government Medical College in Akola (Maharashtra), who was part of an international study that has identified stress among risk factors that account for 90 per cent of coronary heart disease worldwide.

 Three years ago, scientists at the University College London (UCL) showed that sudden cardiac death from emotional stress may be caused by uneven signals from the brain to the heart. 

 The UCL researchers found that an electrical system involved in the transfer of signals from the brain to the heart may be disrupted and is capable of causing potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythms during stress-loaded events.

 For a regular heartbeat, electrical signals that travel across the heart should be smooth and even. Any irregularity in these signals can lead to irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias. 

 Normally, even in times of stress, the electrical output reaching the heart from a region of the brain called the brainstem remains even. But the UCL scientists reported in the journal Brain that the nerves may sometimes fire unevenly during stress. This disturbs the smooth electrical pattern across the heart and could ultimately cause an irregular, perhaps even fatal heartbeat.

 Some doctors have long been advocating a combination of yoga and lifestyle changes to counteract the effects of stress.

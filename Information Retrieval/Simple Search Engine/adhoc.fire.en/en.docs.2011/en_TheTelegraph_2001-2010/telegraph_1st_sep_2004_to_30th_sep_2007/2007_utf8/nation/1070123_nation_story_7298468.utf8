 STAR head to headhunter

 - Mukerjea 

 to help out wifes talent-scout firm 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Peter Mukerjea and 

 his wife Indrani: In the same boat 

 Mumbai, Jan. 22: Peter Mukerjea is leaving STAR Group India on January 31 and will now headhunt talent for media and non-media companies through INX Services where he takes over as chairman.

 INX Services is an executive search company established 10 years ago by wife Indrani Mukerjea. 

 Asked whether the company would still headhunt for STAR, Indrani said: INX Services has had a long association with STAR and that should continue. Peter will help us find the right talent for the STAR Group. 

 Its the first official reaction from the Mukerjea camp to the extraordinary developments at STAR where three CEOs have left in the space of about two weeks. 

 Indrani is going places as well: she has just been appointed regional director, Asia Pacific, for IMD International Search and Consulting. 

 The Zurich-headquartered IMD is the overseas associate of INX Services and has more than 40 offices in 26 countries. She will be the first Indian to sit on the IMD global board in 36 years and is among the youngest directors of IMD. 

 I will be stamping around the region while Peter oversees operations here, said Indrani, who is both promoter and MD at INX Services. 

 Peter Mukerjea said the move to INX was the logical one. Ive achieved everything I set out to do at STAR, he said. There are many more mountains to climb and I am confident that INX will be regarded as Indias fastest-growing company by the end of this decade. 

 The Mukerjeas have great plans for INX Services. INX is tying up with major overseas players to foray into new and exciting areas of business. 

 It is also beefing up its own pool of talent: the company is inducting Vir Sanghvi, editorial director of Hindustan Times and television anchor, and Pradeep Poddar, former managing director of Heinz India, as non-executive directors. 

 Non-executive directors add weight and gravitas to any board, Indrani added. Peter has great retail experience besides his formidable knowledge of the media business, Indrani said. 

 Pratik Basu, former MD of Buena Vista, a Walt Disney subsidiary, has been appointed executive director of INX Services. 

 INX is also in advanced stage of talks with Srei Venture Capital on investments and is working with Kotak Investment Banking to raise resources for the expansion.

 We are planning to raise the capital base of our company so that our new management structure has access to adequate funds to execute the grand plans that we have, Indrani said. 

 INX has 150 employees and five offices and has been growing steadily. Indrani said she expected to see a quantum leap in the companys growth plans in the months ahead. Given what Peter did with STAR, we are sure he will repeat that success with INX, she added.

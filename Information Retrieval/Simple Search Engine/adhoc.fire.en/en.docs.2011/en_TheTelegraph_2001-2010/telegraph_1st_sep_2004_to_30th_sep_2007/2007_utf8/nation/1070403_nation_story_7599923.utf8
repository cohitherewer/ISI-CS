 Dogs day out for fox in hospital ward

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 In dog garb

 Chennai, April 2: Tigers in sheepskin are the stuff of fable, leopards in loos arent unknown these days, but a fox in dog garb must be a first at least in a Salem hospital.

 A pet dog, full with a collar around its neck, sneaked past the gates of the St Marys Hospital campus while patients were getting ready for Sunday morning mass, loitered around the bushes for a while before making its way to the leprosy ward.

 Those still lazing in bed at that hour yesterday immediately spotted the lonely animal and sat up indulgently, some even dipping into their cookie jars to feed it biscuits.

 Taste buds tickled, the animal warmed up to the patients. Then, instead of furiously wagging its tail or excitedly running around in circles, it began making a curious howling noise.

 Taken aback, the patients looked hard and noticed its bushy tail: yikes, they had been entertaining a fox, not a poor hungry dog!

 The hospital spokesperson today burst into laughter as she narrated the incident over phone, saying the patients had only tried to be kind to what they thought was a stray scrounging for a morsel.

 The fox is apparently someones pet and strayed into our campus. It got into the leprosy ward and took the patients by surprise.

 She said the fox had fortunately not bitten or wounded anybody. The terrified patients screamed for help once they realised their mistake and the forest department took the animal away soon after the hospital authorities called them up.

 The district forest office team did not waste any time in removing the troublesome animal from the campus, she said. It was all over in 15 minutes.

 Salem district forest officer R.K. Bharathi said the fox was today released into the Kurumbupatti reserve forest as there were no takers for it. It had a belt around its neck, so it was being domesticated by someone.

 He said domesticating wild animals was an offence and the forest department would take action against the owner, if found. Training such animals to entertain people by the roadside was also an offence, he said over phone.

 Such persons could even land in jail, with a maximum term of three years rigorous imprisonment in case of first-time offence, he said. A fine of Rs 5,000 may or not be slapped.

 This is the first time in recent years that a fox had sneaked into a hospital, he said.

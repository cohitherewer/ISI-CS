 Maoists spill CPM blood

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, March 30: A group of 15 suspected Maoists today waylaid a CPM team, killing two and allegedly kidnapping four, in the jungles of Chowkishal in West Midnapores Belpahari.

 This evenings attack came after several months lull in the Maoist hub, about 230 km from Calcutta, during which the theatre of Naxalite-CPM conflict appeared to have shifted to Singur and Nandigram.

 Those killed are Rampada Singh, 35, member of the partys Belpahari local committee, and Parikshit Singh, 30, CPM member of Simulpal gram panchyat.

 The four hostages include Abani Sardar and Parikshits elder brother Kshitish, both CPM branch committee members, party sources said. Another CPM man, Shankar Nayek, managed to escape and was being questioned.

 Police said the team of seven had been cycling home to Labani village from the budget meeting of Simulpal gram panchayat when they were ambushed in the forests along the Jharkhand border.

 The twenty-something guerrillas were armed with single-barrel guns and tangis, the police said.

 They shot Rampada and Parikshit and then hacked them to death. The local CPM claims that four others were kidnapped, an officer said.

 The deputy inspector-general (Midnapore range), N. Ramesh Babu, said preliminary investigations suggest the attackers were Maoists. 

 But we are trying to find out if any other group, too, was involved. We also need to confirm whether four persons were indeed abducted, he said.

 The district CPM alleged that the attack was a joint operation by the Maoists and the Jharkhand Party (Naren).

 The Simulpal gram panchayat is controlled by the JP(N). The pradhan, Chandana Singh, went into hiding after the BDO lodged an FIR against her for embezzlement, district secretariat member Dahareswar Sen claimed.

 The CPM was building up a campaign against corruption in the panchayat. So, we suspect that the JP(N) took the Maoists help to get rid of our comrades.

 Local MLA and JP(N) member Chunibala Hansda denied the accusation.

 Jawan kills colleagues

 Ahmedabad, Sept. 10: A special reserve police jawan shot dead two colleagues and injured six others in Junagadh district this morning after he was reportedly teased.

 Mohammed Ismail Ansari fired four rounds from his .303 rifle, killing the two on the spot. The injured were rushed to a local hospital where they are said to be out of danger. 

 The 40-year-old fled after the attack but was arrested in Junagadh town, 60km from the spot in Chorwad.

 Junagadh range DIG Mohan Jha said the incident occurred at 8.30am, when the jawans, sent from Rajkot on special duty, returned to their camp after night duty.

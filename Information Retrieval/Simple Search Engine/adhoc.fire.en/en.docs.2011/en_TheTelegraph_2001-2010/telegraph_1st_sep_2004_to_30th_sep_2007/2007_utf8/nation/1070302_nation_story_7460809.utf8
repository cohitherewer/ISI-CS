 Loan relief for parents

 Parents and relatives who shoulder the burden of funding higher education of children have something to rejoice in this years budget. 

 Now, interest paid on such loans is exempt from tax for eight assessment years. However, the exemption was allowed only to the student when he or she starts repaying the loan and not to those who would generally help in raising the funds.

 This years finance bill says the benefit of deduction on interest paid on the loan would be extended to the students relatives as well.

 Mumbai, March 20: Dilwalon ke dil ka karar lootne, main ayee hoon UP, Bihar lootne expect that raunchy Bollywood number to become a chartbuster again. In Uttar Pradesh, that is.

 Pushed off stage in Mumbai, the citys bar girls are dusting their dancing shoes to draw sellout audiences on a different stage rallies across the election-bound state.

 The girls have been in dire straits since the Maharashtra government banned dancing in bars. The offer from political parties in Uttar Pradesh has come as a ray of hope. Girls are leaving everyday in groups of 10 to perform at election rallies. The parties local leaders, many of them sympathetic to us, have helped, said Varsha Kale, president of Bharatiya Bar Girls Union.

 Almost all parties are hiring the bar girls, she said, but refused to disclose the names of politicians. Her office, though, was swarming with representatives trying to contact girls willing to take up the assignment. 

 What is the harm in organising such shows? Cultural programmes have always been part of election campaigns. Whats wrong with getting bar girls to perform? 

 They are professionals who dance to popular Bollywood numbers and Bollywood songs are an integral part of Indian culture. By organising these shows, we are only helping them, said the representative of a prominent Samajwadi Party legislator from Mumbai.

 Nearly 50,000 girls in the citys over 1,500 bars lost their jobs in July 2005 when the Assembly passed a bill banning these places across the state. These bars, where nubile girls in gaudy outfits and loud make-up danced to a liquor-swilling and chips-munching crowd, gave the state Rs 150 crore in taxes. 

 Ranjan Yadav, a bar girls union member overseeing one such group due to leave for Lucknow tomorrow, says: The girls are now flooded with requests and are being paid Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.5 lakh per show. The money is usually shared by a group of 10. We are expected to participate in at least eight to 10 shows. The parties are making boarding arrangements. But we are paying for our travel. They expect the girls to travel in general bogies. That will be very uncomfortable in this heat. 

 Yadav, who sent bar girls to election rallies for Punjab polls last month, added: Maharashtra may have shut down the dance bars but Mumbais bar girls have found a new stage. They are being paid well, too.

 Flooded with offers, he insists that parties make advance bookings.

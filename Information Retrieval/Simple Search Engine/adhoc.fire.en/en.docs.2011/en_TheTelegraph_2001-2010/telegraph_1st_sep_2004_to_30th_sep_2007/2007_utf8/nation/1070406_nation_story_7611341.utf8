 Bhopal, April 5: The Madhya Pradesh Lokayukta has sought the removal and disqualification of all BJP corporators in the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) on the ground of corruption, sending shockwaves in the party.

 The move the first of its kind comes three months after the Lokayukta forced state minister for water resources Jugal Kishore Bagri to step down. A chargesheet was filed against Bagri in January this year for alleged irregularities in the appointment of schoolteachers in Satna when he was an MLA.

 In his order, Lokayukta chief Ripusudan Dayal said the BJP corporators were responsible for the Rs 85-lakh loss that the civic body incurred and the amount should be recovered from them. 

 He has also recommended that the guilty corporators be debarred from contesting elections for the next five years. The current term of the BMC is till November 2009. 

 With 39 corporators, the BJP enjoys a majority in the 66-member body. However, the mayor belongs to the Congress.

 Dayal said he had acted on a complaint filed against the corporators alleging their involvement in a faulty tender award to a company for infrastructure development in Bhopal. Now, it is up to the state government to act against them, Dayal said.

 If the ruling BJP under Shivraj Singh Chauhan dithers, the Lokayukta can file a case under a Lokayukta court or move a criminal court. 

 We are examining all aspects. I have asked the state urban development minister to look into the matter, Chauhan said today.

 The chief minister has reasons to be worried. The BMC is packed with the BJPs Young Turks, who are close relatives of influential local leaders and form the base of the partys strength in the state capital. Moreover, their expulsion and disqualification would cause acute embarrassment to Chauhan and his party ahead of next years Assembly polls.

 There are broadly three options before the BJP now. Its state government can either delay the process, fight a legal battle against the Lokayukta or opt for fresh polls.

 Those in favour of a fresh election say it will give the BJP a chance to claim the crucial mayoral post, which it had lost in 2004 because of a rebel nominee.

 But most BJP corporators are against the idea. Party leader in the BMC Ashok Pandey said he and the others would move court against the Lokayukta directive.

 Congress leader Arif Aqueel, who had filed a petition against the BJP corporators, said this is the first time so many elected representatives have been collectively accused of corruption. It shows the true face of the BJP, said Aqueel, who is an MLA from Bhopal North.

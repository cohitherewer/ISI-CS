 Ajit walks out on Mulayam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ajit Singh: Fresh fire

 Lucknow, Jan. 18: The Rashtriya Lok Dal today officially withdrew support to the Mulayam Singh Yadav government, following in the footsteps of the Congress.

 The Samajwadi Party-led ruling alliance is now reduced to 210 seats in the 403-member Uttar Pradesh Assembly, which began a special session this morning. The House has been adjourned till January 24.

 While the government still enjoys majority, this could change if the Supreme Court rules against the 2003 merger of 38 BSP rebels with the ruling party. The verdict is expected early next week.

 No one knows what the judgment will be. We will, of course, honour the Supreme Court judgment and decide our next step in the light of its directive, parliamentary affairs minister Azam Khan said.

 The RLD, which had earlier withdrawn its three ministers, submitted a letter to the governor this afternoon saying the 15-member legislature party was formally walking out of the alliance.

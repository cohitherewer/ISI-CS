 Japan blow to nuke claim

 Tokyo, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Japan has no plan to recognise India as a nuclear power but will refer to a US law allowing the sale of nuclear fuel and reactors to India to shape its strategy, the governments top spokesman said today.

 Such recognition would enable Japanese companies to participate in the construction of nuclear power stations in India, Japans Yomiuri newspaper had said earlier in a report on Prime Minister Shinzo Abes plan to visit India later this year.

 Abe would express support for the US-India agreement, giving de facto recognition to Indias status as a nuclear power, the paper had said.

 As the only nation to suffer a nuclear attack, we have placed importance on international nuclear non-proliferation based on means such as the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Japanese government spokesman Yasuhisa Shiozaki said.

 Taking this into consideration, I believe we have to decide our nations thinking through careful examination of the details of the US-India agreement, said Shiozaki, the chief cabinet secretary, adding that Japan will continue to urge India to sign the treaty.

 Supporters say the US law, signed last month, will boost strategic ties with India, which has nuclear weapons, but critics fear it could undermine efforts to stem nuclear proliferation.

 Japan, with an eye on Indias rapid economic growth, agreed last month to launch economic partnership talks and strengthen ties in a number of fields during a visit to Tokyo by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 The US had opposed nuclear cooperation with India for 30 years as India developed nuclear weapons in breach of international agreements and never signed the NPT.

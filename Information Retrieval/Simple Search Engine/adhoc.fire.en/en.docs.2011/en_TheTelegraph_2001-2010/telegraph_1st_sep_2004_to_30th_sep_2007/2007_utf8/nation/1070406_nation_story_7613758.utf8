 SC scanner on Shariat challenge

 New Delhi, April 5: The Supreme Court today admitted a PIL challenging the validity of Shariat courts on the ground that they were in conflict with or parallel to the Indian judicial system, reports our legal correspondent.

 Despite preliminary objections by the Centre, a bench headed by Justice A.K. Mathur admitted the petition filed in 2005 by advocate Vishwa Lochan Madan.

 The PIL has sought immediate dissolution of all Islamic and Shariat courts in India, saying they do not allow criminal law to have its natural run. 

 However, the Centre submitted an affidavit saying the decision of these courts are advisory in nature and in no way amounts to interference with the countrys judicial system.

 Pawar notice

 The poll panel has sought an explanation from Sharad Pawar for alleged violation of the model code of conduct in Uttar Pradesh by announcing a relief package and an export subsidy for sugar mills.

 Mumbai, Aug. 1: Arthur Road Jail had not prepared for Sanjay Dutts arrival it did not have a uniform his size, so the actor got to sleep in his white shirt and jeans last night.

 This morning, his lawyers were trying to find a way to get Sanjay out. Right now, we are looking for means to seek bail. We received the operative order of the judgment today. It will take two-three days for us to apply for bail in the Supreme Court, Satish Maneshinde said.

 The bail plea will be heard at the courts convenience. The court may take from a day to two-three weeks to give its verdict. So at this point it is not clear how long it will take Sanjay to get bail, if at all, added Maneshinde who visited him with sisters Priya and Namrata and girlfriend Maanyata. 

 Sanjay had a sleepless night with visitors jail staff and inmates and mosquitoes streaming into his 90x90ft Barracks No. 1 cell. The barracks has one large cell with 30 prisoners and three small ones. Though the gates of prison cells close at 6.30pm, an exception was made, a jail source said.

 But Sanjay kept to himself and sat quietly in his cell, staring at the wall for hours. He seemed to be in a state of shock and refused food. Later he had some fruits, the source said. 

 The one time he allowed himself a smile was when he met Munnabhai MBBS. A jail doctor called on him around 9am. When he introduced himself, the actor smiled his name was also Sanjay.

 While it tries to get him bail, the actors legal team is also fighting to keep him at Arthur Road. The jail meant only for undertrials is overcrowded it has space for 800 inmates but houses 3,000 and there is talk Sanjay might be shifted to Yerawada near Pune or Thane.

 His family is keen he should be in a Mumbai jail, so they can visit them. But these things are not easy to arrange, a jail official said. A decision will be taken tomorrow.

 Yesterday, the lawyers had requested that Sanjay and his friend Yusuf Nullwala sentenced to five years be allowed to stay together but the request was denied. 

 But a PTI report quoting a jail official said the two were together and that Sanjay was not in Barracks No. 1 or 10.

 He has been given regulation blankets. He asked for newspapers which were supplied to him, said Swati Sathe, the jail superintendent. He came with a set of foreign-made toiletries. There were towels etc that came from ITC Grand Central (the hotel near the jail where his sisters had been waiting for the verdict).

 Sanjay had also brought a change of clothes. He brought 10 packets of Marlboro Lights, three bottles of mineral water, a set of underwear and a white kurta and jeans. We allowed him to keep everything but the clothes, Sathe said. 

 Sathe attended a meeting with the inspector-general of prisons, where the actors security and the issue of shifting him were discussed.

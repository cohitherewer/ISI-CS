 Cong seals UP poll deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Alarmed at Rahul Gandhi (picture above) mingling freely with the public in disregard of security concerns during his Uttar Pradesh roadshow, the Centre has said it will advise him to abide by the rule book on protecting VIPs

 New Delhi, March 25: The Congress today officially announced its tie-up with the Bharatiya Kisan Dal, the only alliance it has struck in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh.

 The special attention the Congress has paid to farmers problems has inspired them to join hands with us, state Congress chief Salman Khursheed said at a news conference, dismissing suggestions that talks with the Kisan Dal began after the Congress failed to strike deals with other parties. 

 An alliance was already in the making when Rahul Gandhi addressed a rally in Muzaffarnagar recently with the Kisan Dals Rakesh Tikait by his side. The deal was sealed after Rakeshs father, Bharatiya Kisan Union chief Mahendra Singh Tikait, gave the go-ahead.

 The Kisan Dal will contest 65 seats with the support of the Congress. In turn, it will lend its organisation muscle to the Congress in west Uttar Pradesh.

 Rahul will revisit the heartlands western regions and hold joint rallies with the Tikaits. We will accompany Rahul till he becomes Prime Minister, Rakesh said to questions on whether the alliance will cease after the elections.

 Khursheed raised the issue of farmer suicides and referred obliquely to Amitabh Bachchans support for the Samajwadi Party, saying glitz and glamour cannot solve farmers problems.

 He said elections in Uttar Pradesh are a matter of life and death for the party and it would try to expand its base by addressing farmers concerns. The next government in the state, he added, will be influenced by the Congress.

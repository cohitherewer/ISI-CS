 Hyderabad, June 4: Congress leaders in Andhra Pradesh are looking up the land distribution programme adopted by Bengals ruling CPM to take on agitating Marxists in their state.

 A team of party legislators will leave for Bengal on Wednesday to study the programme there.

 We want to see whether the CPM (in Bengal) occupied government land arbitrarily and gave it to the urban and rural poor, said N. Kiran Kumar Reddy, party legislator and chief whip of the government in the legislature. We want to know if land-grabbing was practised in the states ruled by them (the CPM).

 The CPM, which changed sides and joined hands with the Telugu Desam Party, has launched a land agitation to grab vacant government and private land to distribute it among urban and rural poor.

 CPM politburo member and party state secretary B.V. Raghavulu said his party was a partner with the Congress in the 2004 general elections when it promised to give plots for housing to the urban poor and land to the rural poor for livelihood. Even after three years, most of these promises are not fulfilled.

 Raghavulu is facing criminal cases filed against him under the anti-land grabbing act for participating in several agitations, which have embarrassed the government.

 After the cases against him, CPM leaders recently called on Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to complain against the YSR government, alleging vindictive attitude against political agitators.

 The CPMs move to grab private land has caused discontent among farmers. Nallamuthu Chittibabu, a farmer of Ibrahimpatnam in Krishna district, died of a heart attack after the Marxists grabbed his two-acre plot.

 A fact-finding committee of the state Congress, which toured the districts affected by the CPMs land agitation, called on the chief minister today. It recommended that the government initiate action against the CPM activists whose campaign led to the deaths of the farmers, and provide compensation to the families.

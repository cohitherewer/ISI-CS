 Mittal: Charting progress

 London, Feb. 6: Lakshmi Mittals steel group has started a new experiment to show how the merger of his Mittal Steel with Arcelor is progressing by televising aspects of the process on a website called www.arcelormittal.tv. 

 This does not mean that Lakshmi Mittal is starting a new movie channel, said an amused spokesman for Arcelor Mittal in Luxembourg, where the administrative headquarters of the group are based. 

 Mittal did once invest in a Bollywood channel called B4U (Bollywood for You) he later regretted doing so and he does like to mingle socially with glamorous folk from the Hindi film industry whom he invites to his parties. 

 However, the intention of ArcelorMittalTV is to offer the groups 330,000 employees scattered across 60 countries fortnightly episodes outlining the integration process and merger progress. 

 Although aimed primarily at employees, Internet users will be able to log on, though at certain points they may have to provide personal information to gain further access. 

 The experiment is initially for four months but may be extended. 

 The spokesman conceded that if the experiment is deemed to be successful, it could also be adopted by Corus and Tata Steel, which is combining British, Dutch and Indian practices. 

 Mittal, Arcelor Mittals president and CEO, will respond to issues raised on a monthly basis, the spokesman said, though he was unsure whether Mittal would appear in person or provide written replies. 

 His son, Aditya, the chief financial officer of Arcelor Mittal who has general management board responsibility for communications, said in a statement: Post-merger integration is a significant challenge for any company. Whilst the integration of Arcelor Mittal is progressing very well and we are pleased with the progress to date, we recognise that mergers throw up a lot of questions and issues for employees. We want to deal with these in an open and transparent way in order to help foster support and trust in the new organisation. 

 He said: Effecting a successful integration is absolutely our priority for 2007. We are focused not only on integrating the companies at an operational level, but also in building a united culture for the new company. The new TV site has been designed to help us succeed in this aim. 

 Arcelor, which is the worlds second biggest steel company, has extensive operations in France and Spain, while the biggest, Mittal Steel, whose management structure has been dominated by one family, has plants in many countries but not yet in India. 

 To drive through the merger, Mittal had to agree to accept Arcelor Mittal as the name of the merged company and also some reduction of his familys influence. 

 Arcelor Mittal has welcomed the Tata-Corus merger as a step in the right direction because Mittal has long been a proponent of consolidation of the steel industry. But merging Mittal Steel with Arcelor cannot be easy. 

 The aim of the site is to provide regular and frank updates on how the integration is progressing, what challenges the company is facing and how it is working to effect a successful integration and build a truly united global industrial leader, the statement said. 

 It added: Each episode is focused on a particular region or topic and features interviews with employees talking candidly about the issues and concerns they face, as well as the successes enjoyed to date. 

 The first three episodes have already been broadcast, dealing with The Challenge, The Americas and R amp;D. 

 All visitors to the site, including employees, have the opportunity to blog their thoughts and comments on the integration process, other topical issues and event concerning the company. 

 In the first nine months of 2006, the total revenue of the group amounted to $65.4 billion, with production capacity of about 130 million tonnes representing around 10 per cent of world steel output. The company aims to grow in the Chinese and Indian markets, the statement said. 

 It has been confirmed that Arcelor Mittal will have a new brand logo, incorporating the concepts of the future and change.

 Gandhi off must-read list in UK schools 

 London, July 13 (PTI): Mahatma Gandhi, Winston Churchill, Martin Luther King and Adolf Hitler have been dropped from a list of historical figures recommended for teaching under a radical new secondary school syllabus in the UK.

 Under the curriculum to come into force next year, schools in Britain will no longer be specifically advised to focus on the four figures apart from Joseph Stalin and Benito Mussolini in their lessons on 20th century history. Specific periods such as the War of the Roses, too, have been snipped from the notes accompanying the statutory curriculum. 

 Pupils aged between 11 and 14 will study broad topics, including the World Wars, the Holocaust, the British empire and slave trade.

 The list of recommended authors includes contemporary writers such as Douglas Adams and Alan Bennett, 20th century writers, including T.S. Eliot and George Orwell, and earlier writers like Jane Austen and Charles Dickens.

 The students will also have to study at least one play by Shakespeare. And they will still learn grammar and be required to spell properly.

 Ministers had announced reforms to the curriculum for 11 to 14-year-olds to bring secondary education up to date and allow teachers more flexibility over what they teach. 

 A spokesman for the qualifications and curriculum authority said: The new curriculum does not prescribe to teachers what they must include. They know they need to mention these pivotal figures.

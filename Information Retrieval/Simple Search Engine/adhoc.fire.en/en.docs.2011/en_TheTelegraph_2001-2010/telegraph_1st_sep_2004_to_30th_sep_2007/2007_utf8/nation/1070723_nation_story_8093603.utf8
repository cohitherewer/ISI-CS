 PM balm for Bhairon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 22: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited Bhairon Singh Shekhawat at the outgoing Vice-Presidents residence this evening, taking the first step in trying to end the UPA-NDA rancour over the presidential poll.

 Shekhawat put in his papers soon after losing the election to Pratibha Patil by a huge margin yesterday, but his resignation is yet to be accepted.

 Congress sources said the Prime Minister would have called on the BJP leader last evening but could not put off his official engagements. In the constitutional order, the Vice-President ranks higher than the Prime Minister.

 The sources insisted that Singhs gesture was not just a matter of protocol. One of them said: Shekhawat is 84 and has had a long and illustrious political career. The Prime Ministers visit was an acknowledgement of his contribution and standing.

 When the National Democratic Alliance was in power, then Vice-President Krishan Kant had ended his tenure amid some bitterness. Kant, a nominee of the United Front government in 1997, had reportedly been assured he would be the NDAs presidential candidate in 2002.

 The Telugu Desam, then a key NDA ally, had pitched for Kant but his name was shot down by a BJP lobby. Later, the alliance reached a consensus over A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. Kant died of a heart attack soon after his term ended.

 A Shekhawat aide said the BJP leader had asked the government to allot him a house in New Delhi at the earliest because he was keen to leave his official residence before the next Vice-President was elected.

 The aide said Shekhawat had no intention of moving back to Rajasthan but would continue to visit the state frequently as before. Asked if he would involve himself in BJP politics, the aide said: Let us wait and see.

 A BJP source said the party would expect Shekhawat to play the role of an elderly adviser in the manner of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 The George joke that India missed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Fernandes: Lip slip

 New Delhi, March 11: Once the man used to be St George slaying the demons, as Mani Shankar Aiyar told Parliament last year. All that George Fernandes does now is repeat other peoples jokes.

 For instance, when he mentioned yesterday how Atal Bihari Vajpayee had told him many moons ago to lay off the Bofors files, he was merely passing on to the nation the banter between a Prime Minister and a cabinet chum.

 For, Fernandes insisted today, all that Vajpayee was doing was crack a joke with his days-old defence minister when he rang him up to say: Bofors file ko haath mat lagaana (Dont touch the Bofors file).

 If the Janata Dal (United) veteran had expected the country to break into a guffaw at the rib-tickler as he himself doubtless had that morning in South Block he was in for a disappointment.

 Right from the moment his quote appeared in a morning newspaper, which sourced it to a little-known website www.politicsbharat.com none seemed to spot the humour.

 When Fernandes repeated the killer before a TV channel from Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh, no one stopped him saying they had heard it before. Even Vajpayees party betrayed no hint of a smile.

 Perhaps the punch line wasnt timed right, coming just when the BJP was trying to corner the Congress over Ottavio Quattrocchi, alleged bribery conduit in the Bofors scandal.

 None from the BJP reacted officially but senior leaders especially Vajpayee and party chief Rajnath Singh are believed to have decided the joke had gone too far. Even Dal (United) boss Sharad Yadav had had enough. We told him it was too much and he should do something about it, Yadav told The Telegraph.

 Fernandes met the media at 11.30 am. He appeared harried and shaken. It was a joke. Vajpayee was joking, he said.

 The questions that followed often needed to be repeated.

 Fernandes said he had indeed read the Bofors files once but only to find out how the guns had performed in the 1999 Kargil war. It was not to probe but to procure (the gun).

 The BJP accused the Congress of blowing up the controversy. The Congress is drumming up a non-issue, said V.K. Malhotra, the BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha.

 Party leaders claimed a Congress MP had led the TV channels into misreporting Fernandess remark.

 Later, badgered by questions at a news conference, Yadav threw up his hands.

 What do you do when somebody becomes old and senile in your family? he asked. Do you throw him out?

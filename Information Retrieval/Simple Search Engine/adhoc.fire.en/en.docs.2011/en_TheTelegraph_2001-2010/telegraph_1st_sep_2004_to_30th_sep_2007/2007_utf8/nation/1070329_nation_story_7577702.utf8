 Calcutta at bottom of pay hike heap

 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE 

 Calcutta, March 28: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal may be registering the highest growth rate in state domestic product, but when it comes to rise in pay packets, Calcutta is lagging behind other metros.

 The latest salary survey report by TeamLease, a Bangalore-headquartered staffing solution outfit, reveals that in the last year, salary levels have grown by around 11 per cent in Calcutta, three percentage points lower than the national average of 14 per cent. 

 Calcutta is sixth on the salary-hike scale with Mumbai topping it by registering 18 per cent growth and Delhi and Bangalore tied at 16 per cent. 

 We tracked the salary growth of over 1.5 lakh temporary employees working across various sectors in 13 cities across India, said Rajesh A.R., vice-president, temporary staffing unit, TeamLease. 

 He added divergence in salary levels between temporary and permanent employees has narrowed over the years. 

 The survey covered 34 profiles in six industry domains like manufacturing, banking and financial services, consumer durables, fast-moving consumer goods, information technology and IT-enabled services.

 While the slow growth in pay packets may cause some heartburn among prospective employees, the industry attributes it to the law of demand and supply.

 Temporary employment has not taken off as a concept in Calcutta and so the demand is less in comparison to some other cities, which explains the lower growth rate, said Khokan Mookerji, secretary general, Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 

 Although the city is behind other metros in terms of salary growth, employers in Calcutta attach more importance to skill augmentation and reward generously, the report says. 

 According to the survey, the last year saw a 23 per cent increase in compensation for every education increment. In case of Calcutta, the growth has been around 18 per cent, after Mumbais 24 per cent and Bangalores 25 per cent.

 Among the various sectors, IT and IT-enabled services have registered the highest growth in salary levels across the country, besides being the sector with maximum temporary job prospects.

 The same trend holds true for Calcutta, Rajesh said, adding that pay packets for professionals in human resource (HR) and sales are also increasing at a rapid pace in the city. 

 We have seen that the IT and ITeS industry has had a great impact on salary levels in other industries by pushing up wages, said an HR consultant. 

 But there are money and opportunities even beyond the world of technology. 

 The TeamLease survey has highlighted that jobs in the accounts division are the most lucrative for undergraduates looking for temporary jobs, while sales offer the fattest pay cheques for post-graduates.

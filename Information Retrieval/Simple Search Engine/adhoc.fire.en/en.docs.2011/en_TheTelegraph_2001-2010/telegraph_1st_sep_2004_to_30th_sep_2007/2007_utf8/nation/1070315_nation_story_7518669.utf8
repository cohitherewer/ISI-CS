 Beauty magic formula a myth

 John Abraham: The right cues?

 New Delhi, March 14: Gait, hip sway and shoulder movements are important for both men and women, but the key to attractiveness may lie in how feminine a woman and how masculine a man is perceived.

 A new study by US psychologists has shown that perceived attractiveness is the result of compatibility of biological sex and gendered cues masculinity and femininity as specified in society. 

 When compatibility is high as in the case of a masculine male or a feminine female, attractiveness is high, said Kerri Johnson, a research scientist at the University of New York, who conducted the study with Louis Tassinary at the University of Texas. 

 When cues are mismatched as in a masculine woman or feminine man perceived attractiveness is low, Johnson told The Telegraph. 

 She said the findings, published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, show how perceived attractiveness is influenced by social perceptions and not merely by body cues. 

 For centuries, people have been looking for a magical formula for attractiveness, a set of right cues to define attractiveness, Johnson said. Our work suggests that a magical set of cues is going to be hard to find.

 The research to determine factors influencing attractiveness has focused on body cues such as the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Some previous studies have suggested that women with WHR of 0.7 where the waist circumference is 70 per cent of the hip circumference are perceived as attractive. 

 But studies in different parts of the world have thrown up contradictory findings. 

 In some societies, women with even substantially larger WHR were perceived as attractive and the search for cues has remained inconclusive. 

 The new findings may explain how body shapes deemed as attractive vary across cultures. This may be because the very cues that specify masculinity and femininity differ across cultures, Johnson said. 

 She said the bodys shape and motion give rise to basic social perceptions whether a person is male and female and whether a person displays masculine or feminine characteristics. Its these basic perceptions that form a foundation for perception of attractiveness, she said.

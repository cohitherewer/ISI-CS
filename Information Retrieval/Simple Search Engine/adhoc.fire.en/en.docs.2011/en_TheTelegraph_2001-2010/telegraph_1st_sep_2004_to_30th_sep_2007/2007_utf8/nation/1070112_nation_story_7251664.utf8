 Guwahati, Jan. 11: Wrapped in warm clothes, a newborn found abandoned in front of a Guwahati orphanage last night turned out to be the baby Monika Pegu Singh had given birth to nine days ago. 

 As police handed over the infant to her mother this morning and arrested three persons, the missing links in the story of the newborns disappearance from Guwahati Maternity Home six days ago seemed to emerge.

 Among the arrested trio T.N. Pran, Rinku Pathak and Dalim Chakravarty two are employees of another healthcare centre owned by the maternity homes proprietor. Prime accused Nirmal Das, employed with the same nursing home, is absconding. 

 A pregnant Monika had arrived in the city on January 2 to look for her missing bus driver husband and had ended up at the nursing home. Unable to clear the bill, which came to around Rs 3,000, she was discharged without her daughter on January 5 and asked to come back only when she had the money.

 A tea stall owner who saw her crying on a footpath helped her out, but the baby was no longer in the nursing home when she went back on January 7.

 Monika filed an FIR, but it was only yesterday that the police raided the maternity home and rounded up six employees.

 The baby was found just outside Matri Mandir, an orphanage, even as the police were interrogating the suspects. The man who brought the smile back to Monikas face, Kamal Sarma, contacted the cops on hearing that a woman was searching for her lost baby.

 The newborn was found with 10 pairs of expensive clothes by her side. This indicates that she was with a well-heeled family, additional superintendent of police Rajen Singh said.

 The police believe that whoever had adopted the girl realised it was a mistake and panicked when Monikas story got around.

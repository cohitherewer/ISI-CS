 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Offer respect, but only with petals

 You could well call it the great flower fuss. But for the Tamil Nadu government, this effort might be a conservation initiative that rivals those launched by Greenpeace.

 In a state where more statues (of political leaders and film icons) appear to be unveiled than rose saplings planted, a recent official directive says petals are good enough.

 So, dignitaries from Mahatma Gandhi to Sivaji Ganesan, who stare down their lofty perches at Marina in Chennai and elsewhere in the state, will have to go without the truckloads of flowery veneration. Their birthdays and death anniversaries wont be the same again. The petals will have to be offered on the photos of the icons placed below the statues.

 In its petal penchant, Tamil Nadus rulers have taken a leaf out of the books of the Delhi government, which has similar rules in place. There are other, more down-to-earth, reasons, too. Garlands gone, there will be no need to build make-shift wooden stairways that VIPs often use to reach up to the immortals on their big days in life and death. It also prevents any possible damage that such temporary structures might cause to the statue.

 In the charmed circle

 Indias snake charmers appear set to charm the world. A hundred snake charmers from Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh congregated in the capitals Central Park to play their piped instruments without any snakes in sight. For the breed, whove been struggling to make a living ever since trapping snakes was banned years ago, concerts of the kind held in the capital last week are intended to provide a new means of livelihood. 

 Several thousands turned up during the three-day concert organised by Jeevika, a non-government organisation trying to help find ways to rehabilitate snake charmers. The concert may be a prelude to bigger things. The snake charmers have got invitations from Austria to play at the Salzburg festival, while a band of Scottish bagpipers has offered to organise a joint performance, said Bahar Dutt of Jeevika. A music company is also considering recording the charmers melodies. 

 Andhra gets a beer hug

 Andhra Pradesh cant have enough of beer. And if you own a brewery there, it will be a party uncorked every night.

 Nature has done its bit, too. Long coastlines and arid zones spread over 15 districts have given beer-makers the thirsty hordes who find comfort at the bottom of a glass.

 Statistics show Andhra has left Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu behind with a record consumption of 208.84 lakh cases, including 112.88 lakh of strong beer, last year. 

 The Congress government has also removed bottlenecks. The new excise policy encourages drinking joints in large villages. Softer sales regulations have also helped, says excise minister K. Ramakrishna. New rules now allow a liquor outlet every two km in cities and 10 km in rural areas. The minister isnt being generous. Rather, he intends to raise more taxes from beer sales to pay for all the dams and canals his government has promised farmers. So, think before you raise a toast.

 Straight drive

 The scores are rising even before the men in blue pitch in. Days before the World Cup starts on March 13, gifts and endorsements are flying around like slog-over boundaries.

 ast week, Mahendra Singh Dhoni had a good catch: an open-topped Scorpio. The gift from the Mahindras was handed as a good-luck gesture. 

 sked if it will be a problem cruising around, Dhoni said: I will drive the car only at night. He even fielded a googly. When fans wanted to know if the front-seat next was reserved for a special person, the Ranchi pinch-hitter ducked it with a grin.

 Delhi: Jazz fans can today catch the Dutch quartet of Hans Mantel on the bass, Jasper Soffers on the jazz piano, Wim Kegel on the drums and Sjoerd Dijkhuizen on the tenor saxophone. Lydia Van Dam is the vocalist. The venue: India International Centres Annexe Lawns. Time: 6:30 pm.

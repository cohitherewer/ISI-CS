 CPM skips 

Jamiat 

quota meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 15: After 

 yesterdays violence in Nandigram, which has a sizeable 

 Muslim population, CPM lead

 ers today failed to turn up for a 

 conference on reservation for 

 Muslims organised by the 

 Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind.

 The Jamiat had invited 

 several CPM leaders in Delhi, 

 and politburo member Sitaram Yechury had confirmed 

 his participation on behalf of 

 his party. But neither Yechury 

 nor any other leader found it 

 fit to attend it a day after the 

 Nandigram killings. 

 The CPM and Jamiat had 

 frequently been sharing plat

 forms on issues related to the 

 socio-economic development 

 of Muslims in the country. 

 The conference, attended 

 by over 10,000 people belong

 ing to the community, was or

 ganised to demand the imple

 mentation of the Sachar com

 mittee suggestions, including 

 reservation for Muslims. 

 Congress leader and HRD 

 minister Arjun Singh who 

 skillfully skipped the confer

 ences central theme of reser

 vation for Muslims expressed the UPAs commitment 

 to implement the Sachar panel 

 suggestions.

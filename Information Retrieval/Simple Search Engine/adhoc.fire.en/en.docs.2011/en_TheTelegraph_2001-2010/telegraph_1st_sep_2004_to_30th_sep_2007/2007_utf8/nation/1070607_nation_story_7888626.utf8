The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Firm on climate stand with half-smile

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 George Bush

 Berlin, June 6: India wants to enter into a long and beautiful relationship with the US on the nuclear deal but remains coy about supporting George Bush outright on his plans to fix the climate anew for the world.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh arrived in Berlin for an extended conversation on Friday with the worlds most powerful and polluting countries at the G-8 summit.

 Some say the amount of energy the Big-8 will expend over the next couple of days will result in a lot of hot air especially since none of these nations agree on what to do with the climate outside their air-conditioned rooms.

 Clearly, these cynics have the Outreach-5 for company. The term denotes India, China, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa all of whose top leaders are in Germany to formulate a joint strategy on greenhouse gas emissions.

 Singh seems happy to be here, not only because to decline such an expensive lunch would be plain rude, but also because the invitation is a manifestation of Indias growing importance in the world.

 But if you happen to catch a half-smile on the face of foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon as he listens to the G8s promises, you will know that India still prefers the UN route.

 Officials said India would stick with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change because it espoused the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. That is, countries with larger greenhouse gas emissions should pay more to fix the problem.

 Not that New Delhi will tell Bush what it really thinks about climate change when the Prime Minister meets him the same day, especially since the nuclear deal is a more immediate agenda. Menon believes it is important to engage key countries in the world even if you disagree with them.

 Tying itself down to cutting emissions, officials say, will have a definite impact on the current runaway 9 per cent growth at home. 

 But if the West can help India with access to clean technologies that also save energy nuclear plants, for example New Delhi says it is more than willing to listen.

 Clearly, that beginning will be made if Bush agrees with what the Prime Minister tells him about their nuclear deal on Friday.

 Judge jab at SC

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Feb. 9: A Gujarat High Court judge accused of beating up another has alleged the Supreme Court denied him natural justice by transferring him to Sikkim.

 Justice B.J. Sethna allegedly attacked Justice P.B. Majumdar after inviting him and his wife home on January 11. Im the real victim but I have been projected as the villain, Justice Sethna said, alleging the apex court never gave me a chance to explain my side of the story.

 The judge is yet to decide whether he would go to Sikkim, not an ideal place for an asthma patient like him, or resign.

 Everybody knows what it means to transfer a senior judge to Sikkim, where there is actually no vacancy. Its a punishment posting, we called it kalapani, said the judge, due for retirement in July 2009.

 Justice Sethna said the allegation that he beat up Justice Majumdar was baseless. I did tell him to leave my house as he was very abusive with me and was casting aspersions on my elder brother, who is an advocate in the high court. I was naturally furious as I could not tolerate the insult of my elder brother, who is a father figure to me. He is a well-known philanthropist.

 Justice Sethna argued that his transfer goes against public interest, claiming he disposes of 20 to 25 cases daily. The Bar Association has decided not to give him a farewell party.

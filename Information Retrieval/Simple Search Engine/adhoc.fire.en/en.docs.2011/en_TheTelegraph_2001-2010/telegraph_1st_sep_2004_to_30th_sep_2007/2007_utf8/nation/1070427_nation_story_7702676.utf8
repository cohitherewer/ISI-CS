 Hurriyat six in rally net

 MUZAFFAR RAINA

 Srinagar, April 26: Jammu and Kashmir police today arrested six Hurriyat leaders following Sundays rally where participants raised anti-national and pro-Lashkar slogans. 

 The police had lodged an FIR against Syed Ali Shah Geelani and his confidants after the rally, organised to celebrate the Hurriyat hardliners return from Mumbai after a surgery for cancer.

 The rally triggered an uproar after news channels flashed reports about the presence of armed gunmen and pro-militant banners in the rally, a charge that both the police and the separatist alliance have denied.

 The police today arrested Geelanis deputy Ghulam Nabi Sumji and other senior party leaders, including Massarat Alam and Firdous Shah, during a news conference at a hotel here. 

 They have been arrested in connection with the FIR lodged against them on Sunday, DIG, Srinagar-Budgam range, Farooq Ahmad said. He, however, parried questions over Geelanis arrest.

 The Hurriyat Conference has condemned the police action. This is a naked aggression and exposes the hollow claims of the government about democracy. They (government) has levelled false allegations against us, said senior Hurriyat leader Mohammad Ashraf Sahrai. 

 The huge public response during the rally has troubled the authorities and what has followed is political vendetta, he said.

 The arrests have come as the Opposition at the Centre mounted pressure on the government to take action against Geelani.

 The BJP today demanded Geelanis arrest and staged a walkout in Parliament after leader of the Lok Sabha Pranab Mukherjees assurance that the government will make a statement could not convince it.

 In Jammu and Kashmir, the Shiv Sena condemned the rally and burnt Geelanis effigies. 

 Several separatist and militant groups, however, hailed the rally, attended by around 20,000 people, as a big success.

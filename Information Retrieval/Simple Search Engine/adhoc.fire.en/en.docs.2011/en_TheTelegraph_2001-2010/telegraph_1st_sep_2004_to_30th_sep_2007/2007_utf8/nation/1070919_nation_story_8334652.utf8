 J amp;K Citu leader missing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Srinagar, Sept. 18: The Citu vice-president in Jammu and Kashmir was allegedly abducted in Udhampur district today while he was returning from a hydel power project site.

 .P. Samyals driver Anil Kumar and the Bolero in which they were travelling are missing. 

 Udhampur police chief Ashok Sharma said a case of abduction has been filed. 

 CPM state secretary M.Y. Tarigami said the driver contacted Citu office-bearers and told them that Samyal has been abducted after their vehicle was stopped by some masked persons. The driver, he added, was also beaten up. 

 The police found this unusual. The driver called Citu officials over the landline to inform Samyal has been abducted. He did not call us and has even switched off his mobile, Sharma said. 

 According to the drivers claim, the windscreen of the vehicle was smashed and barricades were erected to stop it. We did not find any such clue on the road, the police chief added.

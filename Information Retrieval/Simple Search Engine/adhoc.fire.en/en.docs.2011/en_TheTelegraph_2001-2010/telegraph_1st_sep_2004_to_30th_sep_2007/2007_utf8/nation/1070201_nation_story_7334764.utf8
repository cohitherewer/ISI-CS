 New Delhi, Jan. 31: The Supreme Court today cleared the Centres proposal to reserve for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes 22.5 per cent of the 50 per cent seats in postgraduate medical courses that are filled through an all-India entrance examination. 

 The move will ensure that 22.5 per cent seats in all postgraduate courses approved by the Medical Council of India are reserved for SC/STs.

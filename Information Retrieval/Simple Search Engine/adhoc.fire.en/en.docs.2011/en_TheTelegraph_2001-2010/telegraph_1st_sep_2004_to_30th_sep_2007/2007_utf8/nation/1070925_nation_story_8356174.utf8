 MS becomes MS cheerleader

 MANDIRA NAYAR

 New Delhi, Sept. 24: The Prime Minister spent the last two evenings before TV watching the exploits of Indias newest idols, perhaps as a welcome break from the tensions of the nuclear standoff.

 Manmohan Singh was glued to the small screen till the last ball of the ICC World Twenty20, soaking up the triumph of another MS (Dhoni) and boys. As Pakistans last wicket fell, Singh, according to his media adviser, exclaimed: Keep it going, team India.

 Last night, the Prime Minister enjoyed the final of Indian Idol 3, a show that clearly betrays an American influence, without for once having to worry about what Prakash Karat might think.

 He enjoyed the show, the adviser said. The Prime Minister congratulated Prashant (Tamang), the winner.

 The 75-year-old Singh, who recently had prostate surgery, watched todays game flanked by his family. After Indias victory, he said: They played well and made us all proud.

 He congratulated the team, as did President Pratibha Patil, but did not forget to compliment Pakistan as well.

 Last night, too, the Prime Minister would have spared a thought for the loser. Shillongs Amit Paul, like Singh himself, now boasts a Guwahati address because of professional commitments.

 Amit was pipped by Darjeelings Prashant when counting ended for the 7 crore votes from fans, mostly from the rivals home turfs.

 Its not known if Singh permitted himself a chuckle at the thought of voters from Darjeeling, Sikkim and Meghalaya deciding what was a national poll.

 Both Idol contestants had met the Prime Minister a day before the final. Singh is learnt to have discussed musical matters with them.

 The economist-turned-politician knew everything about the talent show, said Niret Alva of Miditech, involved in producing the programme. He (Singh) said they had united people through their music and covered so many differences, Alva, who was present at the meeting, added.

 Leading lights to banish bulbs

 Some of Indias leading celebrities from the entertainment industry are expected to kick off a ban-the-bulb campaign that Greenpeace plans to launch in the capital this month. The celebrities will be expected to sign a petition to ban the incandescent light device the yellow bulb that continues to light up homes across the country but which has long been branded a power-guzzler. 

 Energy economists have often argued that compact fluorescent lamps, or CFLs, are more efficient and will help India conserve electricity. But fluorescent lamps cost many times more than incandescent bulbs. Greenpeace now plans to coax a million or more people to sign a petition that will urge the government to help phase out incandescent bulbs by introducing subsidies for CFLs. 

 The petition is to be presented to the power ministry. Besides Delhi, celebrities in other metros are also being invited to join the campaign. Greenpeace says its got confirmation, but wont say whos coming yet. 

 Crushed in speed dating

 Love beats all odds. But as Narendra Kumar learnt last week, it can beat you hollow, too. Especially, if its a case of hurried romance. 

 The 26-year-old was thrashed at the home of a girl he had known only for a couple of hours. 

 The ice cream factory worker thought he had found in Archana Singh a cool girlfriend. They hung out together and Narendra claimed Archana showed immense interest in him. I took a step forward and went home to meet her parents and introduce myself, he said. 

 But things took an ugly turn there. Archana, instead of admitting to her fascination for the young man, refused to recognise him and accused Narendra of stalking her. That, police say, triggered the beating. 

 He was let off with a fine of Rs 1,200 and a warning. But the bitterness wont go away anytime soon. After such a betrayal, Ive decided not to trust women ever again, he says.

 Trunk tribute

 When shutters were downed during a recent bandh to protest the court stay on OBC quotas, doors at a Madurai temple were closed to honour the memory of a long-serving devotee.

 Angayarkanni, the 41-year-old elephant who had become one of the endearing symbols of the Meenakshi Sundareshwarar Temple, passed away. She had been suffering from multiple problems, including lung and kidney ailments. Even a team of top veterinary doctors summoned from Chennai couldnt save her. 

 The mortal remains of Angayarkanni, who served the famous temple for over three decades, had to be lifted by a crane and taken to a garden on the outskirts of the town for the last rites. 

 A special abhishekam (bathing ritual) was performed and her body was draped in silk. Bags of salt and holy ash were shovelled into the huge pit in which she was interred. A huge draw in life, she remained that way in death.

 Flying high

 Andhra Pradesh can look forward to better airports if a pact signed between the state government and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) takes off.

 Kadapa and Warangal will be the first to benefit from the agreement inked between the AAI chairman and top state officials in the presence of chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy recently.

 The government will hand over the land for the development of the airports and provide free electricity and water initially for five years. It will also offer security to the facility. 

 AI will pay for the development, operation and maintenance of the airports, which will be equipped to handle ATR-42 and ATR-72 planes.

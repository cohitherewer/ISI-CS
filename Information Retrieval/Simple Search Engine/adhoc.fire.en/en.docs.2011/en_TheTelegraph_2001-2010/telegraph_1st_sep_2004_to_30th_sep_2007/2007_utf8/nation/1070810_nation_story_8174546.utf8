 Cable race

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Aug. 9: The M. Karunanidhi government has decided to get into the cable TV distribution business in Tamil Nadu.

 The move announced at a meeting chaired by the chief minister today is being seen in political circles as an attempt to break the monopoly of Sumangali Cable Vision, owned by the Maran family. The decision will be formalised at the next state cabinet meeting slated for August 11.

 The Marans Kalanidhi Maran and his brother Dayanidhi are the chief ministers grand-nephews and Karunanidhis family have been at loggerheads for months. Things came to head when the Dinakaran newspaper, a part of the SUN group owned by Kalanidhi, carried a report putting Karunanidhis younger son M.K. Stalin ahead of brother M.K. Azhagiri in the DMK succession race.

 Sumangali, said to control 80 per cent of the cable network business in the state, ensures maximum visibility to the SUN TV bouquet of channels. 

 All that could change now. Not only is the DMK government making a foray into the cable business, it is also launching a channel Kaliagnar TV on September 15.

 The government has decided to apply to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India to obtain a licence for running multi-system operator (MSO) as a state enterprise.

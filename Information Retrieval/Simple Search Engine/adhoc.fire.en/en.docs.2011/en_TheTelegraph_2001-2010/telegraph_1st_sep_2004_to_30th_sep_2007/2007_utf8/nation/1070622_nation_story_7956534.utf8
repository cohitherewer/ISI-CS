 Glare on credit card late fees

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 21: Anti-monopoly watchdog MRTPC today ordered a probe into commercial banks system of late fees and fines, which consumer activists feel are often used to fleece customers.

 A study claims that these banks have collected more than Rs 6,000 crore in 10 years Rs 1.64 crore a day through these extra charges.

 These come in the form of penalty for late payments and exceeding the credit limit as well as fees for services like cash advance, cash withdrawal and cheque pick-up, besides service tax on all these fees, says the study by Credit Card Holders Association of India.

 The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (MRTPC) has asked its investigative arm the director-general of investigations and registration (DGIR) to hand in its preliminary probe report within 90 days.

 DGIR had earlier accused HSBC and Citibank of delaying bill delivery and realisation of cheques towards payment just to charge an increased interest rate, a late fee and fines.

 Consumer activists say that other banks may be doing it, too. They argue that since card companies charge high interest rates in India the highest in the world they should not charge so many other fees as well.

 The commission, if it judges the practice as an unfair trade practice, can order the offending party to stop it, senior advocate Niraj Singh said.

 The DGIR will ask banks to furnish details of their income from such fees and fines, officials said.

 An HSBC credit cards spokesperson said: We have not yet received any notice from the MRTPC. If we do, we shall certainly examine it and respond to its queries.

 A Citibank statement said: We will co-operate with the relevant authorities as and when required.

 The commission has already started a judicial inquiry against Citibank, HSBC, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank for adopting unfair practices in selling credit cards. This happened after the DGIR submitted a preliminary probe report.

 The report alleged these banks were making false promises such as that of lifetime insurance while selling credit cards, without spelling out the fine print.

 The practice, it said, flouted the Reserve Banks November 2005 guidelines on credit cards and caused losses to the public.

 The DGIR also found that banks were doing credit card business through direct sales agents who worked either as independent contractors or on commission. These agents were soliciting customers without revealing their independent status, thus creating the impression that their promises were as good as (those) made by an officer of the bank.

 Car amp; smut clips stir Kavita pot

Lucknow, Jan. 4: Police today seized a car that might provide clues to the murder of Kavita Chaudhary, whose purported liaisons with politicians have now thrown up smutty video clips for voyeurs.

 The 29-year-old university lecturer from Meerut was allegedly killed by her partners in crime on October 24 over the share of spoils from their sex-and-blackmail racket that targeted VIPs.

 Kavitas body hasnt been found but the seizure of the white Bolero near Mathura railway station has pepped up the police. Officers said they had seized documents indicating the car was owned by prime accused Ravindra Pradhan, who had surrendered to Meerut police on December 24.

 Meerut police chief Navneet Sikera today doubled the list of suspects, saying the murder plot involved eight persons.

 The CDs shot by the gang, purportedly showing Kavita and politicians in compromising position, seem to have been turned into MMS clips that are circulating in the illegal porn market in cities such as Meerut, Varanasi and Lucknow.

 Take a detour, and dodge poll curbs

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, April 3: You dont fly directly to Etawah in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh from Delhi, but take a detour south to Gwalior before crossing the border into the heartland.

 Sounds absurd? But this is just what leaders on the campaign trail have been doing to get around an Election Commission cap on poll expenditure. But the limit applies only to payments made in a state going to elections.

 In recent days, Rahul Gandhi, Motilal Vora, Satish Sharma, Amar Singh, Jaya Prada, Suresh Pachauri and others have landed at Gwalior airport, en route to Uttar Pradesh. 

 The money spent on getting to Madhya Pradeshs Gwalior where there are no elections isnt, technically, a poll expense. Gwalior, used as a transit point, shares its border with Uttar Pradeshs Etawah, Mainpuri, Etah, Jhansi, Lalitpur and Agra. Some of these have functional air-strips where the leaders planes can land.

 On Monday, Rahul Gandhi flew into Gwalior with Congress leader Satish Sharma on a chartered plane and left for Jhansi by helicopter. On Wednesday, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan are scheduled to arrive. Both are headed to destinations in Uttar Pradesh.

 According to the Election Commission, this trend could challenge Section 77 of the representation of peoples act, which seeks to put a cap on expenditure by candidates and parties during elections and thereby ensure, as much as possible, a level playing field. Usually, the limits apply to amounts that candidates and/or parties spend on election campaigns, including travel bills.

 Madhya Pradeshs chief electoral officer J.S. Mathur admits the practice of hopping across from Gwalior is aimed at getting around the spending limit, but says there is no provision that prevents leaders from travelling from a neighbouring state that isnt going to elections.

 It merits closer scrutiny. But as far as present-day law is concerned, the model code doesnt apply to a state not going to polls. It is for the district authority to establish if the visitors have a specific purpose in the town they want to land in, or take off from, the IAS officer said.

 Mathur conceded that using Gwalior airport might be helping parties reduce election expenses. A few days ago, the collector of Gwalior asked me if the leaders should be allowed to land. The permission was granted, but on a technical ground because the code of conduct isnt in force in a neighbouring state, Mathur said. 

 Leaders dont find anything wrong with the hop-skip-jump routine. Manak Aggarwal, the spokesman for the Congresss Madhya Pradesh unit, says his party could include the travel to Gwalior and beyond in its expenses. I dont think it (landing in Gwalior) is a violation of any rule. It is just a matter of convenience, he added.

 Polls in the areas bordering Madhya Pradesh will be held in the first round, starting April 7. The elections will be held in seven phases.

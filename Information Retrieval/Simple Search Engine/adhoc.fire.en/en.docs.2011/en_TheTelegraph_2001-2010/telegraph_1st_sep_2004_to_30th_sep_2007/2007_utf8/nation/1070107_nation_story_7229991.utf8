The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 PM cold water on brothers hopes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Singh: Not game

 Chandigarh, Jan. 6: Before he could apply to bhabi, big brother Manmohan Singhs stern eye has stopped Surjit Singh Kohli in his tracks.

 The Prime Minister has poured cold water on his step-brothers ambitions to contest next months Punjab Assembly polls on a Congress ticket.

 Amritsar businessman Kohli, who had yesterday announced he wanted to be fielded from the Amritsar (South) seat, today told The Telegraph he would not be contesting after all. The chapter is closed, he said over his mobile.

 Congress general secretary Rajpal Singh explained that Kohlis decision not to press for a ticket follows a directive from Manmohan Singh to his family members to stay away from politics.

 The Prime Minister has also told state Congress president Shamsher Singh Dullo that no one from his family will contest any election, Rajpal said.

 Chief minister Amarinder Singh had met Kohli a few days ago to discuss his chances of contesting the elections. The meeting embarrassed the Prime Minister, who asked Amarinder who had encouraged Kohli to go public with his demand for a poll ticket and why no one had consulted him about the matter.

 Kohli is believed to have earlier told his friends he would plead his case with Manmohans wife Gursharan, who is due to visit Amritsar soon for a wedding in the family. Today, he clammed up when asked to comment on the directive from his elder sibling.

 A Congress leader said Kohli had decided to contest the polls because of prodding from his fellow traders.

 They had been telling him he would win by a huge margin because of the clean image he and the Prime Minister enjoyed. After becoming an MLA, he could seek concessions for the traders, he said.

 But the Prime Minister believes that his family members should engage in social service with no political strings attached.

 The Shiromani Akali Dal, however, tried to embarrass the Prime Minister some more by throwing Kohli a bait.

 The party hinted it might consider fielding the businessman in future elections if he joined the Akali Dal and did some service to the Sikh community in Amritsar.

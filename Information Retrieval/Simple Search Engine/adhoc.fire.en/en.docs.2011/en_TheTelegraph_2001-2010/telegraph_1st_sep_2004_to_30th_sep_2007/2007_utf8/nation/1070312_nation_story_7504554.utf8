 High court denies bail in global hacker case

 New Delhi, March 11 (PTI): Delhi High Court has refused to grant any relief to an Indian detained in Japan and facing extradition to the US for allegedly hacking emails of an American.

 Rajdutta Patkar has been held at the Kusog detention centre in Tokyo for allegedly hacking emails of an American national based in Hawaii. 

 A case was registered against him in an American court and his extradition is being sought for trial.

 The mother of the accused approached Delhi High Court seeking direction to the ministry of external affairs to intervene at a diplomatic level to secure the release of her son.

 Having considered the arguments advanced by the counsel for the petitioner (mother of the accused) as well as the counsel on behalf of the respondent (the Centre), I feel that no such mandamus (direction) can be issued (to the government), Justice B.D. Ahmed said.

 The court, while refusing to give any direction to the government, however, asked the Centre to provide all information available with the ministry and the Indian embassy in Tokyo to the mother of the accused within three weeks.

 If convicted in the US, Patkar could face a maximum jail term of five years.

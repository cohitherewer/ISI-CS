 Chauhan home

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 7: Family and friends today trickled into the home of Amol Chauhan, who was on the Kenyan Airlines flight that crashed on Saturday.

 Shooter Ashok Pandit was among the first to reach the Vile Parle address. Sharad Chauhan (Amols father), whom I have known for a long time, has shown remarkable courage and has remained composed, he said. 

 Both Sharad, Parle Group boss Ramesh Chauhans brother, and Amol were national-level shooters.

 Pandit said the last time he met the 27-year-old Amol was at the Maharashtra Shooting Range in Worli about a fortnight ago. I told him to take shooting more seriously. He promised to train harder and win gold at the next National Games.

 Amol had won two silver medals at the last Games.

 Seema, Amols wife of two years, is expecting their first baby next month. Amol, a director with Parle Products, was also the vice-president of the Biscuit Manufacturers Association.

 Rajesh Jain, the spokesperson for the association, described Amol as an articulate young man with a great understanding of the biscuit industry. 

 He said Amol showed his true mettle by fighting for the industry against the rise in prices of sugar and vegetable oil. Because of his efforts, finance minister P.C. Chidambaram raised the excise exemption on maximum retail price to Rs 100 per kg.

 Amol is the fourth member of the family to die in a plane crash. In 1964, Rameshs elder brother and cousin died when their Ahmedabad-bound aircraft plunged into the Arabian Sea. Fourteen years later, his sister was killed in an Air-India crash.

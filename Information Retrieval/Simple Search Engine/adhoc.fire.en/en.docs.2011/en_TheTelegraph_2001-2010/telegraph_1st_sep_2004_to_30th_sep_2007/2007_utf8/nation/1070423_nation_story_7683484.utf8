 Emigration law set to change

 New Delhi, April 22 (PTI): The government, jolted by Babubhai Kataras arrest in a human trafficking case, has initiated a move to make the emigration act more stringent.

 The ministry of overseas Indian affairs has decided to tighten the 1983 law to regulate emigration and rein in unscrupulous recruiting agents. 

 A bill to amend the act is being drafted by the law ministry, sources said today.

 However, the bill is unlikely to be introduced in Parliament in the second part of the budget session beginning April 26, as it will have to be first taken to the cabinet.

 The amendment will pro- vide harsher punishment for human trafficking, incl-uding an increase of the minimum prison term to five years from six months. There is also a proposal to hike the fine from Rs 1,000 to Rs 25,000.

 Confirming the move, minister for overseas Indian affairs Vayalar Ravi said the bill was in the final stages of preparation.

 The bill also provides a regulatory framework for emigration of Indian workers for employment abroad. The aim is to safeguard their interests and make the agents responsible for recruitment of every person sent abroad, the sources said.

 Soldiers molest in mask of militants

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, April 16: The protectors had turned predators, and they were dressed for the part.

 Posing as militants, Mukesh Kumar and two fellow soldiers of the Indian Army barged into the house of Mohammad Ayub in a village in Rajouri on Saturday night, police said.

 Ayub was not home.

 Mukesh, Shakeel Ahmad and Khursheed Ahmad forced Ayubs wife Noor Jahan, 45, and his 20-year-old daughter Safia to cook for them.

 Then they told the women to sleep with them, according to a complaint lodged by Ayub, who rushed home when he learnt about the incident.

 Ayub alleged that the three tore the clothes of his wife and daughter and tried to rape them, but the women fought back.

 When mother and daughter began shouting for help, the trio sensed there could be trouble. They tried to flee to a nearby forest, when Ayubs neighbours, drawn by the womens cries, gave them chase. 

 Mukesh was caught, while his associates slipped away.

 The villagers locked Mukesh in a house before handing him over to the police.

 Militants are known to disguise themselves in army or police uniform to avoid suspicion. The three soldiers act has now handed the militants proof of what they have often claimed: that government forces target people in disguise to malign the rebels.

 Ayubs son Rafiq had been killed last year, allegedly by militants. But the family now suspects Mukesh and his cronies were behind his murder.

 Noisy protests rocked Dudsaan Pain village, nestled in the hilly slopes of Thanna Mandi area, today, as villagers alleged that soldiers posing as militants have been harassing women for some time. All three belong to Rajouri district.

 A senior police officer told The Telegraph that cases of molestation and trespassing at night under Sections 354 and 458 of the Ranbir Penal Code (the Indian Penal Codes equivalent in Jammu and Kashmir) have been registered against Mukesh.

 The police are on the lookout for Shakeel and Khursheed. The officer said that when arrested, the two would be put through an identification parade.

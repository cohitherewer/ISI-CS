The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Tied at altar, but stuck in time warp

 - Life in a groove

 Bangalore, Jan. 20: Ever thought any marriage could be stuck within a time zone?

 Well, thats the case with a good many young BPO couples working to Australian or American or English time. For them, money is no longer a headache, spending quality time or finding any time at all to spend with each other is.

 The most unfortunate twosomes are those working in Australian and US shifts. When the husband comes home after the US shift at 3 am, the wife is fast asleep and when she leaves at 6 am for her Australian shift, he is snoring like theres no end.

 She gets back around 3 pm and I would have already reached office by then. Forget wishing her good night, there is no time even for sweet nothings after an exhausting days work, newly-wed Piyush Agarwal said.

 So when do they catch up? Only on weekends, obviously. With BPOs closed at that time, then is the only chance they get.

 Apart from catching up on sleep, a grocery checklist and unpaid bills are top of the agenda. So we spend some time shopping for essentials and throw in a movie or dinner. All this has to be done only on Saturday as I have to sleep early on Sunday to wake up in time to catch the office cab Monday morning, said wife Reeta, with a wry smile.

 For Ananya and Ashish Chakraborty too, the grind is similar. Married for almost two years, they do the rounds of glitzy malls on weekends and get back to their shifts on weekdays.

 BPOs and call centres mostly work within Australian, UK and US daytime hours. While the Australian shift starts at 5 am and goes on till 4 pm, UK shifts are between 1.30 pm and 1.30 am. The US timings are between 6 pm and 9 am. Employees work in six- or eight-hour shifts. Commuting takes almost three hours both ways.

 With most companies not allowing mobiles at the workplace, it is difficult to connect even in this age of instant communication. The only option couples have is to wait for the weekend break.

 Bharat Kumar, who is into outbound (he has to make calls to prospective US customers), once clicked his wife Bhavya passing by in a cab with his camera phone. I emailed her the picture and she was thrilled.

 Frankly, the romance has gone out of our lives. We seem to live as singles and follow each others instructions on post-it notes, reminding one to feed the dog or take her out for a walk before leaving for work, said Rishi, whose first wedding anniversary is coming up. I dont know if both of us will be able to get leave to celebrate.

 With nearly 4.5 lakh BPO employees in Bangalore, there are several hundred young couples in similar straits. Most weddings are a result of romance in the office where the male-female ratio is almost equal.

 I first saw Rashmi sitting in the cab. It was love at first sight, at least for me. Afterwards, I had to ward off competition and pursue her. She finally agreed to marry me after one-and-a-half years.

 But we have soon realised that being in close proximity in office was better than living together as we hardly get to even speak now, said Rahul Thimmaiah who has now moved to another company.

 Although the money is good for the 20-somethings, major decisions like starting a family have to be deferred. It is easier to make a choice on which car to buy than when to have a baby. Every time we go on short holidays, friends and relatives alike send teasing SMSes like Is it going to happen now? said Rashmi.

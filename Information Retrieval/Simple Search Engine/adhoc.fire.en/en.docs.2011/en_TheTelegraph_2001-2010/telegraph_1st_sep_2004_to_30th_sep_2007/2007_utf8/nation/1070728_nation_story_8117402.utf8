 New Delhi, July 27: Indias holy trinity national security adviser M.K. Narayanan, atomic energy chief Anil Kakodkar and foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon was put on display today to hardsell the nuclear deal with America even as top US diplomat Nicholas Burns held a synchronised briefing in Washington.

 It was the clearly reluctant but self-confessed karmayogi Kakodkar who was the focus of the hour. For the past two years, since the Prime Minister first initiated the nuclear dialogue with US President George W. Bush, Kakodkar had epitomised the scientific opposition to the deal. Today, he was put under the arclights, by Narayanan, to defend it.

 Asked if his scientists were now jubilant about Indias brand-new nuclear status, Kakodkar looked distinctly unhappy. Sitting as he was next to Narayanan, he could hardly break ranks. So he chose the middle path.

 Were all karmayogis. We will carry on our work. I could have had a huge wish list. But we are consistent with what has been achieved, Kakodkar said.

 Earlier, he had been asked if he was happy with the outcome. Yes, I am happy, Kakodkar said. I was very unhappy when I thought (some elements) wont be there. (My criticisms) earlier were part of the national position. What I am saying now is also part of the national position. I have no reason to be unhappy.

 Narayanan set the tone for the news conference, declaring that India and the US had got a very good deal that would mutually benefit both countries. He denied there were any extraneous linkages, such as the purchase of 126 aircraft by India.

 The Opposition and the Left parties were more than satisfied with the briefing they had received over the last couple of days, he said.

 Menon rejected Pakistani criticism that the deal would upset the balance of power in the region, and stressed that it was about civilian nuclear cooperation.

 Again it was left to Kakodkar to say the agreement would allow India to carry on with its domestic three-stage nuclear programme and research and development, which would remain independent.

 While the deal would enable Indias 14 safeguarded civilian reactors to receive fuel from the US and other countries, America had agreed that India would be able to keep its military programme going, he said. If Delhi wanted to continue making bombs, implied Kakodkar, it could. 

 But when a journalist from Londons Financial Times asked if the deal, in fact, allowed India to leverage its military programme even as its civilian programme carried on unabated with international help, Narayanan exhibited a flash of fury.

 I think its time that certain countries overcame the belief that we are interested in proliferation. If we need additional (fuel) for a stockpile, we know how to do it. We are not using this agreement as an excuse to enhance our strategic fuel capabilities, he said.

 In the absence of the agreement text, which will also be simultaneously released only next week after the Bush administration clears it, Narayanan read out an agreed joint statement with the US. India, it said, was ready to work with like-minded countries to fashion a new consensus on non-proliferation and realise the goal of a nuclear weapon-free world.

 Menon read out a joint statement by foreign ministers Pranab Mukherjee and Condoleezza Rice on next steps: first, India would negotiate a safeguards agreement with the IAEA and seek support for nuclear trade from the 45-member Nuclear Suppliers Group. Only after this would Bush put the agreement to his Congress for a final vote.

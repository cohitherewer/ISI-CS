The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cricket telecast

 New Delhi, Jan. 29 (PTI): Delhi High Court today refused to grant a stay on its interim order directing Prasar Bharati to telecast deferred live feed of the ongoing India-West Indies cricket series on Doordarshan.

 The court also issued a notice to Nimbus Communications on a Prasar Bharati petition challenging the order directing the public broadcaster to telecast the delayed feed.

 Fixing the matter for hearing on February 9, a division bench said it could not pass any order without issuing notices to other parties and hearing them. Staying the single-bench order would be almost like allowing the appeal, it added.

 The bench also sought to know from Prasar Bharatis counsel how the public broadcaster could challenge the interim order without disputing the revenue arrangement order. The counsel replied that the revenue arrangement was not being challenged as it was part of uplinking guidelines issued in December 2005.

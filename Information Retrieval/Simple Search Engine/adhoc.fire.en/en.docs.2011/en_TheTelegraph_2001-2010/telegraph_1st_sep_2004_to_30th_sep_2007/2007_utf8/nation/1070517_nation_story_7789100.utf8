 MP XI to scan MPs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 16: A panel of 11 Lok Sabha MPs will probe cases of misconduct and misuse of parliamentary privileges by members.

 Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, who announced the formation of the committee today, also fixed a tentative timeframe for the panel. The committee will endeavour to submit its report ordinarily within one month of the reference of any matter by the Speaker, Chatterjee said.

 The decision to set up the committee was taken yesterday at an all-party meeting Chatterjee had called in the wake of BJP MP Babubhai Kataras arrest in the trafficking case, which also threw up the names of some other members.

 Congress member V. Kishore Chandra S. Deo will head the committee. The others on the panel are Gurudas Dasgupta, Anant Geete, C. Kuppusami, V.K. Malhotra, Shrinivas Patil, Mohd Salim, Braja Kishore Tripathy, Rajesh Verma, Devendra Prasad Yadav and Ram Gopal Yadav.

 Passports dug out

 A farmer found over 600 passports buried on the banks of a Ghaziabad canal yesterday.

 Police said most of the 680-odd passports, with names and addresses from Ghaziabad district, didnt have the inside pages. He did not rule out a link with the immigration racket in which some MPs are said to be involved.

 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 On a high in IT boomtown

First it spawned farmer-millionaires. Now its throwing up peg-happy upstarts. Liquor barons must toast the infotech boom sweeping Hyderabad, especially its 24X7 new-economy hubs that drum up dollars each minute.

 Ask B.R. Meena, and you will know why the bubbly flows so thick. Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy have totted up revenues of Rs 2,200 crore from liquor sales this year. Next year, it could be Rs 2,500 crore, says the state excise commissioner whose department collects liquor taxes. Those figures arent heard of in the rest of the country.

 The numbers dont include illegal hooch, smuggled liquor from neighbouring states and contraband foreign drinks. These could yield taxes of Rs 350 crore, says Meena.

 Behind the 35 per cent rise in annual liquor consumption are dizzy salaries in infotech firms and sky-high real estate returns. The city of 75-lakh has 5,000 liquor shops and 1,500 bars. Last year, it downed a record 50 lakh cases. Liquor consumption is also quite high among migrant labourers and teenagers above 15, says the additional city police commissioner, A.K. Khan.

 Postman on a new drive

Postman in a car? Dont be surprised. If youre in Kerala, you could soon see them in electric cars threading their way through lanes delivering letters, including Speed Post and other quick-mail service items.

 Reva, the Bangalore firm that makes the cars, has orders to roll out three customised models, to be introduced next month in Thiruvananthapuram and its suburbs. 

 The red cars a colour the postal department has long been identified with will cover an average 60 km a day, ferrying up to 70 kg. It will have a driver and a postman. 

 The ground-breaking move is part of the series of new initiatives launched by the department, which is the worlds largest such network with 1,54,000 post offices.

 Teen ride cut short

Beg, borrow or steal but learn to drive. That seemed to be the zeal driving Kannan to try his hand on a stolen moped.

 The 16-year-old was trying to take charge of his destiny on the roads as a two-wheeler driver when he was police patrol and asked to furnish ownership papers. The action followed a complaint from the vehicles owner.

 Questioned, Kannan spilled the beans, saying he was tempted to try out the Bajaj-M-80 when he found it parked with its ignition keys firmly latched on the dash-board. Kannan, who works as lorry cleaner, wants to be a motorcyclist, too. 

 But, having been jolted in his trial ride, he might give up the idea or wait till he earns enough to buy a two-wheeler. For now, Kannan is in a juvenile reform school. 

 Couture spin-offs

Projects spilled off the ramp at the start of a couture carnival in Delhi this week with the announcement of a fashion district in Dwarka, the fast-growing west Delhi enclave.

 That wasnt all. A textile firm declared it would build a Rs 2,000-crore fashion village near Manesar, a Haryana hotspot not far from the capital. The initial investment, of around Rs 500 crore, will be made in the first phase of the project.

 The Fashion Design Council of India is drawing up a blueprint for the 600-acre showpiece, which will boast of a design school, textile museum, manufacturing units and showrooms. Details of the Dwarka plan arent known, but it is expected to draw large investments and big names. 

Delhi: Lovers of Western classical music can watch a film based on Italian composer Giacomo Puccinis masterpiece Turandot on March 31. Students of New Yorks Metropolitan Opera Chorus amp; Orchestra feature in the movie. The venue: India International Centre. Show time: 6 pm.

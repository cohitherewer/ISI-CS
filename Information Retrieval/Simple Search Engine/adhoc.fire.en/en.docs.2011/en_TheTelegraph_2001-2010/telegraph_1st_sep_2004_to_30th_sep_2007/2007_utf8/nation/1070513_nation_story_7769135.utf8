 Bengal low on defence ladder

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, May 12: Bengal ranks a lowly 14th in a state-wise break-up of the number of ex-servicemen. Punjab is the topper, according to statistics placed by defence minister A.K. Antony in Parliament this week.

 While these figures are not a definitive indicator that Bengalis do not opt for military service in large numbers, they definitely show that 150 years after the first war of independence in 1857 which is commemorated this week the non-martial races continue to be poorly represented in the armed forces.

 Ex-servicemen are registered with the Rajya Sainik Boards and the Zilla Sainik Boards. The defence ministry is urging police and paramilitary forces to recruit ex-servicemen in larger numbers for internal security duties.

 Roughly, 60,000 soldiers retire from the armed forces every year. 

 In Bihar, the government has raised the Bihar Auxiliary Force to combat Maoist militants. The state has recruited 5,000 ex-servicemen in November and December.

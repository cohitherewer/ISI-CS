 Blast confession on Pak table

 Islamabad, March 7 (PTI): Indian officials have forwarded to Islamabad confessions by a Pakistani national on his role in the 2005 bombing of the police headquarters in Hyderabad and requested an update on the probe at the next meeting of the joint anti-terror mechanism.

 Details of the statement by the Pakistani national with alleged links to the banned militant outfit Lashkar-e-Toiba were handed to Pakistani officials at the first meeting of the anti-terror mechanism that ended here today, said K.C. Singh, the additional foreign secretary who led the Indian delegation.

 The Lashkar activist, who was caught in a third country, admitted to his complicity in the Hyderabad blast and was subsequently deported to Pakistan, Singh said.

 India requested Pakistan to probe the case based on the confessions made in the third country and provide an update in the next meeting to be held in three months. Indian officials believe that the confessions in a third country could form a strong and credible case for Pakistan to probe.

 A suicide bomber allegedly triggered a blast at the police special task force headquarters in Hyderabad in October 2005.

 On allegations that India was helping Sindh and Baloch nationalist rebels in Pakistan, Singh said New Delhi would formally reply to the charges. 

 The material forwarded by Pakistan pertained to individuals publishing periodicals expressing their views on Balochistan and Sindh, Singh said. Being a free country, people do express their opinions but it cannot be regarded as evidence of sponsoring revolt.

 Singh also contradicted Pakistans assertions that India, during the talks yesterday, provided only a sketch of a Pakistani national suspected to have been involved in the Samjhauta blasts. 

 He said the suspect in the photograph was identified by survivors of the blast, including Rana Shaukat, a passenger from Pakistan who lost five of his children in the incident.

 Lanka minister in visa trouble

 JOHN MARY 

 Thiruvananthapuram, June 27: A Sri Lankan minister landed at the Cochin international airport without a visa and had to be given a temporary landing permit for $40.

 M.M. Mustapha, the deputy minister of higher education, arrived on a private visit this morning by a Sri Lankan Airlines flight. The Kerala Management Association, his local hosts, received him at the VIP lounge, after which he went for customs and immigration checks. 

 Immigration officials who examined his diplomatic passport found that the minister did not have the visa required for citizens of countries that are members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc).

 Mustapha told the officials he had forgotten to bring his old passport, which carried the visa stamp. The officials at Nedumbassery airport then contacted the bureau of emigration in Delhi. They were told to issue the temporary permit but only after collecting $40 as fee. 

 I have nothing against the officials. They have done their duty. It was a lapse on my part. I did not carry proper papers, said Mustapha as he waited patiently through the formalities. 

 Senior immigration official K.E. Joy claimed that neither the local police nor his department had prior information about the VIP visit.

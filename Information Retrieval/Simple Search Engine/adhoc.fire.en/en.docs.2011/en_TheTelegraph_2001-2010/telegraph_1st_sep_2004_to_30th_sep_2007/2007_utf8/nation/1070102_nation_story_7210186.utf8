 Credit quota for minorities on the cards

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 1: The Centre is clear that education and access to credit will top its agenda for bettering the lives of minorities. The Reserve Bank of India will be asked to change its guidelines for scheduled commercial banks to ensure that a certain percentage of the priority-sector advances is reserved for them.

 A well-placed government source said a figure of 15 per cent was being looked at. In September, when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had unveiled his 15-point programme for minority groups, the Union cabinet had decided that 15 per cent of the beneficiaries of all flagship social and development programmes would be minorities.

 The credit target being thought of is in consonance with this quota, although the government was loath to use the term.

 It pointed out that the cabinet note had said wherever possible (as against desirable or feasible) physical and financial targets should be laid out for the minorities.

 The Prime Ministers charter of minority uplift said: Bank credit is essential for the creation and sustenance of self-employment initiatives.... It will be ensured that an appropriate percentage of the priority-sector lending in all categories is targeted for the minority communities.

 According to the RBIs guidelines, 40 per cent of all aggregate bank advances should be part of the priority sector that includes agricultural, educational and housing loans, micro-finance and loans to small-scale industries, business, retail traders, professionals and self-employed persons. The RBIs advisory was that 10 per cent of this should be given to the weaker sections.

 The source said the governments data shows that the minorities had availed themselves of only 9.3 per cent of the priority-sector loans although their population was nearly 18 per cent. It was stressed that since the majority of Muslims were self-employed in small businesses, the guidelines should be changed to see that a separate target was set for them. It was suggested that the loans be channelled through self-help groups.

 The Sachar Committee report, which analysed data supplied by the RBI regarding priority-sector loans for 27 public and 29 private sector banks, found that the share of Muslims in the amount outstanding was only 4.7 per cent compared with 6.5 per cent for the other minority communities.

 This, the report noted, was disproportionate to the communities respective population.

 It also showed that on an average, the amount outstanding for every Muslim account was about half that of the other minorities.

 The committees study of the states revealed that efforts made by the RBI so far to extend banking and other credit facilities to minorities have marginalised Muslims and mainly benefited the others.

 Its other finding was that some banks have identified a number of areas with a predominantly Muslim population as negative geographical zones where bank credit and other facilities are not easily extended.

 The attitudinal problems, said a source, puts a question mark on whether banks will implement amendments to the RBIs guidelines, when and if they are incorporated.

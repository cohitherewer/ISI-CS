 To Tibet, via Dubai amp; China

 NISHIT DHOLABHAI 

 New Delhi, June 8: Indias greatest neighbour ensures that Indian pilgrims take the longest route to Lhasa.

 A politician and his wife had to travel 3,000 km more to reach Lhasa which is to Buddhists what Mecca is to Muslims all because he was from Arunachal Pradesh. 

 They made the trip in 2005, but it has aroused interest now after an Arunachal IAS officer was denied permission to visit China last month. 

 China argues that Arunachal is its territory, the residents of the state are its citizens and, therefore, do not require a visa. 

 After his meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao in Berlin yesterday, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had described Beijing as Delhis greatest neighbour, with whom India wanted the greatest relationship.

 But Tsering Gyurme and his wifes troubles show just how long the road to the greatest neighbour can be. He has chosen to speak about it now to highlight how difficult it is for a resident of Arunachal to make a regular pilgrimage.

 In November 2005, the couple wanted to fulfil their dream of visiting Lhasa and the seat of the Panchen Lama. But they were denied visas. The grounds were the same that Beijing applied to the IAS officers case recently.

 But Gyurme, determined to make the trip, found a way out. The former agriculture minister in the Gegong Apang ministry was also motivated by stories of his fathers trek to Tibet. 

 Usually, Indians visiting Lhasa have to get a tourist visa in Kathmandu, from where they can take the 955-km friendship highway or a flight to Lhasa. They can also fly to Chinese cities like Chengdu, via Bangkok, and reach Lhasa from there. 

 The Chinese embassy in Delhi does issue tourist visas, but only for Shanghai and Beijing.

 With little hope of getting the visa from the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu, Gyurme was advised to fly from Delhi to Dubai and then to Guangzhou in south China to get to Lhasa. 

 The detour meant he had to travel 3,000 km more than he would have if he had gone via Kathmandu.

 We reached Guangzhou and joined a package tour of 12 Buddhist tourists, 10 of whom were Chinese, Gyurme said. He and his wife were pleasantly surprised to find that they faced no cross-examination by Chinese authorities. 

 But on his return, the foreign ministry wrote to the then Arunachal chief secretary advising him not to allow elected representatives to visit China. This has upset Gyurme and other MLAs. 

 One of them, Koloreang legislator Lokam Tassa, said: My father stayed in Tibet for 14 years. Visiting Lhasa was nothing extraordinary. Now these things are almost like a dream.

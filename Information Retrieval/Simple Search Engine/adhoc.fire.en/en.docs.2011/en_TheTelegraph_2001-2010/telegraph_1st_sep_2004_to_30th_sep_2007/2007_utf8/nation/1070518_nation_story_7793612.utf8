 Quota row with larger bench 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 17: A Supreme Court division bench, which had put on hold the decision to reserve 27 per cent seats for OBC students from this academic year, has referred the matter to a larger bench.

 The bench said there were issues of considerable importance with a bearing on the countrys social life that had to be examined.

 As the suspense prolongs for students aspiring for seats in elite educational institutions, the Centre is likely to request Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan to set up an appropriate bench at the earliest.

 In the normal course, the chief justice should ask another judge to join the two-judge bench hearing the matter. 

 The Centre has been insisting on a bench of at least five judges as it is keen on getting the interim stay on the quota vacated before the matter is scrutinised and a decision on its constitutional validity delivered. That purpose would not be served if a third judge joins the bench that had refused to vacate the stay.

 But the biggest hurdle for the Centre now is that the court closes for summer vacations after Friday. Only vacation benches would sit till the court reopens on July 9. This virtually signals the end of the road for implementation of the quota this year.

 Although the government had sought a five-judge bench, Justices Arijit Pasayat and L.S. Panta, who are hearing the matter, said they were not referring it under Article 145(3) that provides for a minimum of five judges. 

 One option for the government is to request Balakrishnan to directly set up a Constitution bench a five-judge bench to hear the matter.

 But if a three-judge bench were to be composed, it would be free to refer the matter back to the chief justice for setting up a Constitution bench. 

 Justice Pasayat took note of the provisions that had been challenged and questions that have to be answered by the larger bench. 

 They include the validity of the 93rd constitutional amendment which empowers the government to set aside seats for OBC students the policy of reservation as a form of affirmative action, caste-based reservation as well as the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation by Admission) Act, 2006.

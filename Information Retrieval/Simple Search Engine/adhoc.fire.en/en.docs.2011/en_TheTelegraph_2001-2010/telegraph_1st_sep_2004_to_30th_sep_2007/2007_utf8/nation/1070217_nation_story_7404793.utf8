 Divorce? Go, try a patch-up first

 Reconciliation attempt must: SC 

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR

 New Delhi, Feb. 16: A court hearing a divorce case can force the wife or husband to personally appear before it so that it can try at a reconciliation, the Supreme Court has held.

 If the man or woman refuses to appear, the judge can issue non-bailable warrants (NBWs), the apex court said. It explained that in the light of the Hindu Marriage Act, a court was expected nay, bound to make all attempts and endeavours at reconciliation.

 The apex court, therefore, refused to quash an NBW issued by Punjab and Haryana High Court against Italy resident Jagraj Singh, whose wife Birpal Kaur has sought divorce on the grounds of cruelty and desertion.

 Singh had challenged the NBW order, saying personal appearance of the parties was not mandatory in a divorce case.

 He had argued that the high court had exceeded its powers, because the most it could have done was to pass an ex-parte order without hearing him.

 But the apex court rejected the argument, citing Section 23(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which asks courts to try all options for reconciliation before allowing judicial separation or divorce.

 If Singhs argument were upheld, the apex court said, it would virtually make the benevolent provision nugatory, ineffective and unworkable, defeating the laudable object of reconciliation in matrimonial disputes.

 Birpal had moved the high court in 2005 against a family court judgment rejecting her divorce petition. The high court had asked Singh to appear personally so that a reconciliation could be worked out.

 With Singh repeatedly ignoring its orders since November 2005, the high court on May 4, 2006, issued NBWs that were to be executed through the foreign ministry and the Indian consulate in Italy.

 The Supreme Court said that the approach of a court hearing matrimonial matters must be constructive, affirmative and productive rather than abstract, theoretical or doctrinaire.

 Delicate issues affecting conjugal relations have to be handled carefully and legal provisions should be construed and interpreted without being oblivious or unmindful of human weaknesses.

 Section 23(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act says: Before proceeding to grant any relief under this Act, it shall be the duty of the court to make every endeavour to bring about a reconciliation.

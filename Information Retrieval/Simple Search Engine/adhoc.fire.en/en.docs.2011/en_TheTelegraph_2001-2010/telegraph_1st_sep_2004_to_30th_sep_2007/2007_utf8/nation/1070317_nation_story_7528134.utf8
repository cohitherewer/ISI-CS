 March 16: Bengal governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi has the support of his peers over his expression of anguish at the Nandigram police firing.

 Two governors, on condition they wouldnt be named, questioned some CPM leaders charge that Gandhi had overstepped his constitutional powers.

 In an age of transparency and the right to information, Gandhi has done his duty. He is accountable to the people of India through the President and is entitled to share his sense of anguish, one of them told The Telegraph.

 After all, we are supposed to send monthly reports to the President and the Union government over the state of affairs, including the law and order situation.

 The other governor said the killing of innocent farmers was a grave crime and Gandhi had fulfilled his duty by publicly criticising it. Had he not done it, he would have failed in his constitutional obligation.

 The governors said there was nothing in the Constitution to stop a governor from speaking on an issue of such magnitude.

 Gandhis conduct contrasts sharply with those of the political governors who often act as representatives of their former parties.

 In Madhya Pradesh, Balram Jakhars attacks on the BJP regime have ranged from a threat to shoot the chief minister to expressions of disgust at the absence of state ministers from functions that the Congress veteran attends as chief guest.

 Bhai Mahavir, a former BJP leader, had as governor denied then chief minister Digvijay Singh a chair at a breakfast he had hosted for a visiting dignitary.

 In Uttar Pradesh, T.V. Rajeswar has built a reputation for keeping the ruling Samajwadi Party on tenterhooks, prompting chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and his lieutenant Amar Singh to periodically rush to Rashtrapati Bhavan with charge-sheets against him.

 As a representative of the President, Gandhi seems rather to have taken a leaf out of Shankar Dayal Sharmas book. 

 Sharma Congress veteran, freedom fighter and constitutional expert had as President made strong public pronouncements after the demolition of Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992.

 His directive to the government to do all that was necessary to preserve peace and ensure the rule of law might have been an unusual step for a President. But in the circumstances then prevailing, it was widely endorsed as the proper thing to do.

 When a group of journalists, including this correspondent, met Sharma for an informal chat a few days later, he had no regrets. Extraordinary events warrant extraordinary measures, he said.

 Asked if communicating discreetly to the Prime Minister would have been a better option, Sharma retorted that he needed to publicly express his disgust and share his anguish with the millions who felt the same way.

 As secretary to President K.R. Narayanan from 1997 to 2000, Gandhi has had a good opportunity to learn the art of gentle nudging without making political statements. Like Sharma, Narayanan had a formidable reputation for going public in the larger national interest.

 In his Republic Day addresses, Narayanan was wont to take a dig or two at the government over policies he thought went against the public interest.

 It wasnt the NDA alone that got a taste of his independent mind. When, in 1997, the then United Front government tried to impose Presidents rule in Uttar Pradesh after a failed attempt to dislodge the Kalyan Singh ministry, Narayanan returned the cabinets recommendation for central rule.

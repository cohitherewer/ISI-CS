 Hema in purifier gurgle

 SANJAY K. JHA

 New Delhi, Aug. 14: The incurable chatterbox used to caustic queries like Tumhara naam kya hai, Basanti? has raised a question that raises many more.

 Rajya Sabha MP Hema Malini today sprang a question on reverse osmosis water purifiers in Parliament, setting tongues wagging on whether she was plugging the products or pushing the interests of any particular company.

 The unstarred question those that get written answers she asked was whether the government is considering to bring the parts used in manufacturing of reverse osmosis-based purifiers at par with finished purifiers at nil rate of excise duty in order to compete with the imported finished products.

 The actress also sought to know if it was a fact that there was no excise duty on such water purifiers.

 If so, what are the reasons for charging full rate of excise duty on the parts being used in water purifiers; whether it is also a fact that charges of excise duty on parts of water purifiers will make finished products costlier than the finished imported products; and if so, the governments reaction thereto.

 BJP spokesman V.K. Malhotra declined comment on Hemas motive in asking such questions, saying he would have to study the matter.

 But party sources said the leadership would speak to her soon. The actress may not have been aware of the consequences of asking such questions as politics was not her first love, they said.

 Whatever the case, the way the questions have been drafted suggests she might have been helped by experts in the field. They could also be seen as concealing some kind of business interest as Hema appears in an advertisement for a water purifier along with daughters Esha and Ahana.

 Such suspicions could also be fanned by the practice of using question hour to settle corporate rivalries and influence government policy.

 Whether Hema intended any mischief is anyones guess but it is a fact that MPs are often tricked into asking questions in the House. The cash-for-query scam in which MPs were paid to ask questions is an example.

 Hema got written answers from junior finance minister S.S. Palanimanickam.

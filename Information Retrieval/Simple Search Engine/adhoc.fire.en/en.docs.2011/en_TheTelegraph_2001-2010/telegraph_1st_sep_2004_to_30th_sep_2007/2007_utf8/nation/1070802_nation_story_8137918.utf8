 BJP points Goa fraud finger at Sonia

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: The voice vote that saved the tottering Congress government in Goa hasnt silenced the BJP. 

 The BJP today filed a petition in the Supreme Court, challenging the Goa Assembly Speakers decision to restrain two Maharashtra Goa Gomantak Party MLAs from voting during the floor test.

 This, clubbed with a petition on the same matter, will be taken up for hearing on August 6. The petitions seek a stay on the Speakers order and directives to hold a fresh floor test.

 In addition to the legal recourse, the party has stepped up its political attack on the top Congress leadership for the fraud on Constitution.

 Sensing that Congress spin doctors were trying to create an impression that the party high command was not responsible for the Speakers move, the BJP was quick to drag Sonia Gandhis name into the controversy. 

 In a statement released by spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy today, the party said: The BJP holds Sonia Gandhi solely responsible for the unconstitutional and illegal action.

 It argued that Speaker Pratapsinh Rane, a loyal Congressman who had been chief minister for 18 years, had butchered democracy on direct instructions from his party high command.

 Rudy asked President Pratibha Patil to ask governor S.C. Jamir to dismiss the Digambar Kamath government.

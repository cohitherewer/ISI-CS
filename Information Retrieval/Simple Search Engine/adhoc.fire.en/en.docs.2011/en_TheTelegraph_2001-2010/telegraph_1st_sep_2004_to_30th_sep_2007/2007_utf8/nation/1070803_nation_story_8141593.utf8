 New Delhi, Aug. 2: The Indian government has deferred a decision on a request from the US defence department to try out a soldier-protection vehicle made in India with Israeli help, highly placed sources said here today. 

 The Indian Army will induct about 1,400 Aditya mine-protection vehicles in Jammu and Kashmir and in the Northeast. Each Aditya can carry upto 12 soldiers. It is designed to withstand blasts from most improvised explosive devices. 

 The Aditya vehicle is produced by the Ordnance Factory in Medak, Andhra Pradesh. It is also being considered for central and state police personnel in the Naxalite-infested regions along the Eastern Ghats. 

 The Medak factorys joint general manager, B.P. Bapu, said in Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, yesterday that the US has shown interest in purchasing the mine-proof vehicle. 

 Explosive devices planted on roads patrolled by US-led coalition troops in Iraq account for a large number of American casualties in that country. Reducing the number of such casualties is one of the prime concerns of the US military, which has been using electronic jammers onboard its surveillance aircraft to distort signals of mobile phones and radios that have been used by militants to trigger explosions. 

 We can say that it is only an inquiry. There is no decision, a senior defence ministry official said. 

 The Pentagon would like to test the vehicle before considering the possibility of inducting it. US troops in Iraq use armoured versions of the Humvee and the Hummer in larger numbers in their operations. 

 Clearly, the Indian government is mindful of both foreign policy and domestic concerns in considering requests on military equipment from the US. 

 In the past, India has not responded to the US request for troops in Iraq. 

 But diplomatically, the inquiry shows that military hardware supply can be two-way traffic. Till now, India has been seen as only a purchaser of military equipment from the US, the latest of which a warship, the USS Trenton (re-christened Jalashva). 

 The Indian Army currently uses Cassipir mine protection vehicles, originally developed in South Africa, but now also produced in the country.

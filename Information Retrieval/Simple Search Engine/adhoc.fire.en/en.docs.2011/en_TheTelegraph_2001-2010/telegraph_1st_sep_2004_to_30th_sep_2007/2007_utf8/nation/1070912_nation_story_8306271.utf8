 Sena amp; BJP pals again

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: Before the much-hyped joint news conference of the BJP and the Shiv Sena began, the cat was out of the bag.

 The venue had a Sena poster sandwiched between two huge photographs of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani, announcing truce between the two allies.

 Sena working president Uddhav Thackeray completed the formality by declaring that the differences had been sorted out and they would remain friends.

 Gopinath Munde and Nitin Gadkari, the two BJP leaders from Maharashtra who had spearheaded the campaign against the Sena and advocated separation, were present at the conference to endorse the party line. Both vowed to work together.

 The Maharashtra leaders have obviously fallen in line under pressure from the central leadership.

 Uddhav was won over by Advani and BJP chief Rajnath Singh at a lunch meeting earlier in the day. Advani served four-course Sindhi delicacies to the Sena delegation. For Uddhav, who was on a fast today, there was saboodane ki khichdi.

 Later, Advani had a separate one-hour meeting with Uddhav where all the wrinkles in the 20-year-old relationship were ironed out.

 The BJPs Maharashtra unit had been upset with the Senas negative role in the presidential election as well as with Uddhavs style of functioning. But today, Munde stressed the need for working together with greater understanding.

 Uddhav said a new generation was taking over in both parties and there was bound to be change of styles in leadership. So both sides needed to adjust.

 The allies dismissed suggestions that fear of possible snap polls and impending action on the Srikrishna Commission report which blamed several political bigwigs, including some Sena leaders, for the 1993 Mumbai riots had made them bridge their differences. Both cited the overarching Hindutva agenda, which had brought them together in the first place.

 Without divulging details about any understanding over seat-sharing or the post of chief minister, they vowed to contest both the state and the general elections together.

 A Sena delegation also called on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to ask him to reject the Sachar committees report. Uddhav told reporters that the Sena was opposed to the Sachar panels recommendations as they had the potential of dividing the country on communal lines.

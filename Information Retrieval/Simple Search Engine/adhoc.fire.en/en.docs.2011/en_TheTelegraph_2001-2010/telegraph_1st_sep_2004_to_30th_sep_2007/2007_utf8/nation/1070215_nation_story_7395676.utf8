 Slap in Mulayam face

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Lucknow, Feb. 14: The Supreme Court today disqualified 13 Uttar Pradesh legislators who had defected from the Bahujan Samaj Party to help Mulayam Singh Yadav wrest power, but the defiant chief minister rejected calls to step down on moral grounds.

 Why should I? he said. My government still enjoys majority and on February 26, when the House reconvenes, we will prove our strength again.

 The apex courts verdict will not rock Mulayams boat but is a moral blow ahead of elections as it virtually says the formation of the Samajwadi Party-led government in late 2003 was unconstitutional.

 The 13 MLAs broke away when Mayavati resigned as chief minister in August 2003 and extended support to Mulayam. Joined later by 27 fellow BSP rebels, the group of 40 later merged with Mulayams

 party. The BSP petitioned the Speaker to disqualify

 the 13, but its appeal was rejected .

 The apex court, which upheld Allahabad High Courts order that quashed the rebels merger with Mulayams party, justified stepping into the Speakers domain. The five-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, said the Speaker had erred in recognising the split.

 The judges said the Speaker committed an error so fundamental, that even under a limited judicial review the order of the Speaker has to be interfered with.

 They added that normally the matter should have been referred back to the Speaker but the Assembly was coming to an end and allowing the rebels to stay on in the House even for a day would be illegal and unconstitutional.

 A decision on the 13 had to be taken to protect the Constitution and its values and the principles of democracy, the bench added. So the 13 MLAs were being disqualified with effect from 27.8.2003.

 Mulayam welcomed the order but said he would not ask the disqualified MLAs, many of them ministers in his cabinet, to resign. His open defiance has sparked outrage among Opposition parties and several have begun approaching the governor.

 FAQs about the controversy

 What was the row about?

 It

 started with 13 BSP legislators

 breaking away after Mayavati resigned as chief minister

 on August 25, 2003. They extended support to Mulayam,

 who became chief minister on August 29, and were later

 joined by 27 other BSP MLAs. This group later merged

 with Mulayam rsquo;s Samajwadi Party (SP).

 The

 BSP, which had 98

 MLAs, petitioned the Speaker to disqualify the first

 breakaway batch of 13, as it fell short of the 1/3

 required to get around the anti-defection

 law.

 Could

 Mulayam have formed the government without the BSP

 defections?

 No.

 The SP had 142 MLAs, 60 less than simple majority

 in the 403-strong House. Still short by 20 even after

 the defections, he bridged the deficit with the help

 of 10 Independents and 11 Congress defectors.

 What

 was the Speaker rsquo;s ruling on the BSP petition?

 Speaker

 Kesrinath Tripathi (of the BJP) and later Mata

 Prasad

 Pandey (SP) ruled that since the defectors came

 to

 the House together in a group of 40, they had more

 than the 1/3 needed under the defection law.

 What

 did Mayavati do then?

 Mayavati

 moved Allahabad High Court, which in February

 2006

 termed as illegal the merger of the 40 with the

 SP

 as the first group of 13 was formed on August

 27

 while

 the rest joined later. But it referred the disqualification

 issue back to the Speaker.

 Who

 moved the Supreme Court?

 The

 BSP rebels, against the high court order. But

 the

 apex court disqualified the first breakaway

 group

 of 13.

 Can

 the other BSP defectors continue to support 

 Mulayam?

 Yes,

 because the high court has recognised the group

 as

 a separate entity.

 Will

 Mulayam lose his majority now?

 No,

 even if the 33 rebels mdash; two have died and five

 returned

 to the BSP mdash; are expelled, Mulayam will have

 the support of 190 MLAs, five

 more than the majority mark.

 Ottavio blame game on

 OUR BUREAU 

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: The blame game between the CBI and the foreign ministry on who let Ottavio Quattrocchi off the hook in Argentina has begun. 

 The question the CBI cannot answer is why Interpol did not issue a red-corner notice on the Bofors accused who has already reached Milan, his home, from Argentina, where he was detained. 

 The CBI, however, insists that extradition is the foreign ministrys responsibility. The foreign ministry says the CBIs weak case let the Italian businessman slip away. 

 The CBI is also blaming the foreign ministry for not consulting the law ministry, on this occasion as well as when Quattrocchi was in Malaysia in 2003. But the foreign ministry says Malaysias top court had rejected the CBIs plea to review a ruling and dismissed its extradition plea. 

 The CBI says it would file a new case against Quattrocchi.

 Cry for son at film party

 ANANYA SENGUPTA 

 Azhar

 Mumbai, Jan. 22: Dara Modi wants to leave Gujarat but cant bring himself to. Five years after his teenage son disappeared during the riots, he still clings to hope.

 Here, take this, he says, holding out a worn-out photograph of Azhar. I always carry it with me but if you print this, someone might recognise him. 

 He seems oblivious to the difficulty of identifying a 19-year-old youth from the picture of a 14-year-old boy.

 The Modis are in Mumbai for the premiere of Parzania -- starring Sarika and Naseeruddin Shah a film based on their tragedy. The Parsi family looked lost among the glitterati as they posed for the shutterbugs.

 Tears welled up in Daras wife Rupas eyes as she remembered the day she and her children ran out of their home in Ahmedabads Muslim-dominated Gulbarg Society.

 We were soaked in petrol. I thought it was better to be butchered than burnt at least they would find our bodies.

 I was holding Azhars hand when we ran out. My mother fell down unconscious and I let go of his hand to help her. In a flash, he was gone. He was so innocent. He was older than me but if I scolded him, he would listen, sobbed Azhars sister Binaifer, now 17.

 What hurts Dara most is that none came forward to help him trace the boy. The government washed its hands of the matter by giving him Rs 2,500 in compensation for his damaged house.

 I want to go away but I cant give up hope Azhar will come back. In case he is in Gujarat, I have to wait for him. If people watch the movie and help me find him or at least prevent this from happening to anyone else, he said and broke down.

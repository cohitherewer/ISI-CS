 Bengal link in UP arrests 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, June 21: Two militants of a Bangladesh terror group suspected to have carried out last months explosions in Hyderabad were arrested with 7 kg of RDX this evening.

 Mohammad Yakub and Nasir Ahmad members of Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (Huji) were stockpiling explosives to carry out blasts in the Uttar Pradesh capital, police said.

 The mastermind of the plot was Jallaluddin alias Babu Khan, a resident of Bengals North 24-Parganas district, whose name figured during the probe into the Varanasi serial blasts last year, the police added. 

 Yakub and Nasir hail from Bijnore in western Uttar Pradesh. 

 Yakub was the first to be picked up near the Lucknow station with 4.5 kg of RDX. Three detonator wires, two clocks, batteries and a mobile phone were seized from him. He led the police to Nasir, who was arrested from the Naka police station area of the old city an hour later. About 2.5 kg of RDX was recovered from him. 

 Huji modules have been reactivated in Uttar Pradesh over the past seven months. They have smuggled in at least 100 kg of RDX during this time, state police chief G.L. Sharma said.

 Yakub told reporters Jalalludin, believed to be the Hujis pointman in India, had sent him to Bangladesh and Pakistan for arms training six months ago.

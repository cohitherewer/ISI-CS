 Sack race at Kalam door

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: Rivals in Uttar Pradesh took their battle to Rashtrapati Bhavan today, the Samajwadi Party demanding the sack for the governor and V.P. Singh the dismissal of the state government.

 Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh, accompanied by MPs Jaya Bachchan, Ram Gopal Yadav and Shahid Siddiqui, told President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam that T.V. Rajeswar had turned Raj Bhavan into the headquarters of the state Congress.

 The governor, he said, was plotting to destabilise the government and should be sacked before he became Buta Singh II. Buta had to resign as Bihar governor after the Supreme Court ruled that his dissolution of the Assembly in 2005 was unconstitutional.

 Soon after the Samajwadi team left Raisina Hill, former Prime Minister V.P. Singh walked in with the demand for Presidents rule in Uttar Pradesh.

 VP, who is trying to persuade the Left not to oppose the dismissal of the Mulayam Singh Yadav government, was accompanied by Jan Morcha colleague Raj Babbar and Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan.

 The Jan Morcha, an anti-Mulayam front, has described the Uttar Pradesh government as an illegitimate child of the unprincipled politics of the Samajwadi and the BJP.

 The Lucknow drama had shifted to Rashtrapati Bhavan yesterday after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met Kalam after a session of the Congress Working Committee.

 The CWC had stopped short of recommending Presidents rule, demanding instead that the Mulayam government quit on moral grounds.

 Amar today continued his attack on the Congress and said party president Sonia Gandhi had been the first to congratulate him when the Samajwadi government was formed three-and-a-half years ago.

 How come we suddenly became illegal and unconstitutional? he wondered.

 He did not spare the Prime Minister either, mentioning Manmohan Singhs stint as finance minister in the P.V. Narasimha Rao government, which he said ran on bribes as had been exposed in the Shibu Soren scandal.

 Amar told Kalam his party should get the opportunity to prove its majority on the floor of the House. After the meeting, he said the President had been informed about Rajeswars role in the current controversy.

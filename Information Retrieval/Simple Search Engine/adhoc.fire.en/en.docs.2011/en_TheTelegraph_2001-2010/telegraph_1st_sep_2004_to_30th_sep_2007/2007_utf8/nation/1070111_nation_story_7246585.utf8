The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Psst! Please invite Pakistan President, not PM

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: The countdown to another chapter in India-Pakistan bonhomie begins on Saturday, when external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee travels to Islamabad to invite Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf and not, despite Saarc convention, the Prime Minister for the 14th Saarc summit likely to be held in the first week of April in the capital.

 As usual with Pakistan, though, theres a story behind the story of the invite. The fact that India is inviting the Pakistan President and not Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz to the Saarc summit indicates a new realism in New Delhi that it must deal with the real power behind the Pakistani throne.

 The story doesnt end here. It seems that some weeks ago when New Delhi was gearing up to send the invites all around, Pakistan sent a message saying it would be nice if India could invite Musharraf, instead of Aziz.

 That led to some discussion in the foreign office. The realists shrugged their shoulders, pointing out that Musharraf was where the action was, anyway. The purists argued that Saarc convention dictated that heads of government are invited, not heads of state.

 Which is why, they said, Aziz came to the last summit in Dhaka, not Musharraf. However, they conceded that the Pakistan President, who makes his own rules, attended the Saarc summit in Kathmandu in 2002.

 The realists won the day.

 In fact, for this Saarc summit, as many as three Presidents will be present besides Musharraf, there will be Sri Lankas Mahinda Rajapakse and Maldivess Abdul Gayoom along with Nepals Prime Minister G.P. Koirala. 

 Mukherjees two-day visit to Islamabad is likely to be a significant milestone in the roller-coaster bilateral relationship, although no agreements are likely to be formally signed.

 However, much is expected from the talks he will have with Musharraf, Aziz and Pakistan foreign minister Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri, all on Saturday.

 From Siachen and Sir Creek to an easing of the visa regime to a possible visit by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Pakistan in the near future, a gamut of issues will be discussed.

 Letter drama unfolds

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, April 13: The Centre claimed that it had not received till Friday evening a letter which the IIMs said had been faxed as well as couriered yesterday.

 In the letter, the management schools have asked the Centre to consider a proposal to declare the general category results on April 21 if the legal uncertainty persists.

 The HRD ministry said it would respond to the request only after receiving the letter, fuelling speculation that the government is playing for time. If the court clears the air, the Centre can avoid taking any decision that will hurt the interests of several bright students.

 IIM Bangalore director Prakash B. Apte, who had drafted the letter, said: Of course, weve sent the letter. We faxed it yesterday, and also couriered it. If they havent got the fax, theyll get the courier today.

 Ministry sources suggested the bureaucrat in charge of IIMs and IITs is on leave and the fax could have come to his office. They did not say why someone else could not take charge, considering the urgency of the situation.

 Bias slur on minority funding

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 30: While the debate on affirmative action for minorities rages, not all such communities seem to be getting benefits in proportion to their population from the funding mechanism meant for them.

 While Muslims and Christians receive financial assistance from the National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation more than their proportion in the overall minority population, Buddhists most of whom are economically backward are almost left to fend for themselves.

 Lama Chosphel Zotpa, a member of the National Commission for Minorities, has alleged that too much emphasis on politically significant communities might be the reason for the discrimination.

 Among the five notified minorities, Muslims, who make up over 72 per cent of the total minority population, account for 77 per cent of the beneficiaries, sources said. As for Christians, who account for 12.7 per cent of the minorities, 15 per cent of the beneficiaries are from the community.

 But Buddhists, constituting 4.2 per cent of the minorities, account for only 0.5 per cent of the beneficiaries.

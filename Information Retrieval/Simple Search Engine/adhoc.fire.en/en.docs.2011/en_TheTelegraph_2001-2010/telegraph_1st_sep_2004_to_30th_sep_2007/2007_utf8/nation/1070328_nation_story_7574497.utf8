 Cry to stall Sethu to save Ram bridge

 NISHIT DHOLABHAI

 New Delhi, March 27: Rams name is back to haunt the Sethusamudram ship canal.

 Yesterday, on the eve of Ram Navami, BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi asked the UPA government to stall its most ambitious naval project as its alignment would spell doom for Rama Setu, also known as the Adams Bridge.

 The Adams Bridge a series of sand-dune islets and shallows linking India and Sri Lanka south-east of Dhanushkodi near Rameshwaram is locally believed to be the bridge that Ram built to invade Lanka and rescue Sita. 

 It is to be dredged out completely to open up a direct route between the Indian east and west coasts, removing the need for ships to sail round Sri Lanka.

 Earlier, a Tamil Nadu court had asked the Centre to investigate if the chain of islets, being dredged out under the Rs 2,427-crore project, is indeed the mythological bridge built by Rams army of monkeys.

 We are not opposed to the canal, but to its alignment. Tomorrow is Ram Navami and taking this opportunity, the Prime Minister should review it, Joshi said yesterday.

 Citing a mix of religious, environmental and geopolitical reasons, Joshi argued that the Sethusamudram project threatens to destroy the countrys religious symbols, like the Dhanushkodi and Kodanda Rama temple, believed to be located in those waters.

 The former HRD minister claimed that all the religious leaders in the south to whom he had spoken regarding the project had opposed it.

 The bridge, Joshi claimed, is revered by millions of Hindus, Muslims and Christians and is known by various names like Setu Mandir, Rama Setu, Adisetu and Adams Bridge.

 Priya puts allies first

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, June 23: When Priya Ranjan Das Munshi was flooded with requests from his party for an invite to watch Pratibha Patil file her nomination this morning, he turned down most of them with a heavy heart.

 Thanks to the Election Commission, the parliamentary affairs and information and broadcasting minister had no alternative.

 Reason: Room 63 of Parliament House which the commission has chosen for presidential candidates wishing to file their nomination can seat 30 at best. And rules say rooms cannot be changed on a political whim.

 So, yesterday, Das Munshi decided that barring party chief Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, entry for other Congress leaders would be in order of seniority, region and gender.

 There was another, more important, criterion. That was, UPA allies should get preferential treatment over the Congress because of their support for Pratibha. So, for every Congress person present in the room, there were nearly two UPA representatives.

 The Congress leaders who made it to the room were Pranab Mukherjee, A.K. Antony, Shivraj Patil, Arjun Singh and Sushil Kumar Shinde. Meira Kumar, Ambika Soni and Mohsina Kidwai made up the Pratibha sorority.

 As the run-up to the poll draws to a close, the UPA has emerged a cemented alliance. Not only are the allies together, but the Congress has managed to bring the Left on board, bonded with the BSP and counts on persuading Mamata Banerjee to vote for Pratibha.

 In contrast, the NDA appears divided. Some of the BJPs allies are not enthusiastic about Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and have indicated they would team up with either the UPA or the third front. 

 Also, within the BJP, questions are being asked why barring Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Jaswant Singh and Sushma Swaraj, the others are not proactive about Shekhawat.

 The campaign against Pratibha, suspected to have been unleashed by the BJP, has set off a mixed reaction, with some wondering why the seniors had allowed themselves to get influenced by Sudheendra Kulkarni. 

 The former PMO official and L.K. Advanis political secretary is now George Fernandess political adviser. A portion of Fernandess official residence is being used as the BJPs war room for the poll.

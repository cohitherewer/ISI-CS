 Meeting on DMK crisis

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, May 12: The DMK has convened an urgent meeting of its administrative committee in Chennai tomorrow in the backdrop of the crisis in the partys first family.

 The crisis was triggered by a row on who should succeed M. Karunanidhi as the party leader, which led to an attack on a daily owned by Kalanidhi Maran, the DMK chiefs grandnephew. Supporters of Karunanidhis eldest son M.K. Azhagiri allegedly led the attack.

 Sources said the meeting would take stock of the events that led to the crisis and the uncertainty about Union IT and communications minister Dayanidhi Maran continuing in the cabinet. Karunanidhi is under pressure from within the party and his family members to seek the ministers withdrawal from the cabinet.

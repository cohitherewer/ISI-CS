 Fishy smell in Ram bridge row

 - Faith matters to Dhanushkoti, but loss of livelihood worries it more

 Dhanushkoti (Tamil Nadu), Sept. 16: In this slender lands end, faith runs strong.

 Ram, local people swear, ground his dhanush (bow) in the sands after returning victorious from Lanka. And so the name Dhanushkoti.

 Its a tale they have grown up on like the other legend of the exiled prince marching across the sea to rescue Sita from Ravan over a bridge built by Hanumans vanar sena (monkey army).

 Yet, its not faith but environment concerns that take over when it comes to the question of whether to leave Ramar Sethu or Adams Bridge untouched or demolish it and go ahead with the Sethusamudram ship channel project.

 Lets not get too much into the historicity of Ramar Sethu. If that area is demolished, it will destroy the coral reefs, leave us with no protective barrier from any future tsunami and pose a direct threat to the sacred Rameshwaram island, says Manikanda Sharma, a local priest.

 Half the people here dont know whether Ramar Bridge exists or not, says another resident, a trader, who did not want to be named.

 The bridge partly submerged islets of sand shoals that stretch across to the Lankan coast about 18km away is a matter of faith, he says, not the key issue.

 Sharma, a former trustee of the ancient Sri Ramanathaswamy temple in Rameshwaram, sums up the mood of the local people. Mostly poor fishermen, they say the Rs 2,427-crore project, dredging a channel across the sea to cut sailing time between Indias east and west coasts by nearly 30 hours, would spell ruin for their livelihood.

 Already, in the last 20 years, fish catch in this area has drastically come down, forcing us to stray into Sri Lankan waters, says a fisherman.

 If the canal is dug, what little breeding that takes place in this area will also disappear.

 Sharma, more knowledgeable than the average folk in this swampy stretch, 14km from Rameshwaram Island, is worried about environmental violations.

 We are more worried that all guidelines, including those on dumping of dredged material, are being flouted, he says.

 He emphasises the threat from natural calamities. 

A church in ruins, a battered post office and remnants of a few buildings amid little sand dunes stand as grim reminder of the 1964 cyclone or was it another tsunami? that devastated Dhanushkoti, including its quaint rail link to Rameshwaram.

 Eighty-year-old Neechal Kali, one of the few survivors of the 1964 cyclone, however thinks the ship channel would restore the glory of Dhanushkoti, now a deserted village, as big ships passing through this stretch will stimulate coastal shipping and development of small ports.

 As for Ramar Sethu, he says, even if it had been built, it must have been washed away by now.

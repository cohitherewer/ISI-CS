 Clean chit

 New Delhi, June 15 (PTI): Allegations in a documentary that prompted Denmark to halt adoptions from India are false, the countrys adoption regulator has said.

 The Central Adoption Resource Agency (Cara), an autonomous body under the women and child development ministry, said its probe shows Ramesh Kulkarni, who claimed that his children were adopted from a Pune centre without his consent, knew he was signing away his kids.

 Documents collected during a preliminary inquiry show that Kulkarni had himself approached the agency in Pune through a social worker to make his children available for adoption, it said.

 The stamp paper on which Kulkarni gave his consent is with the agency. His sister and brother-in-law signed the consent forms as witnesses. The deed was written in Marathi, Kulkarnis mother tongue.

 No adoption can be legalised in India without a no-objection certificate from Cara.

 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Cameras to trap dumping devils

 Mumbai plans to slam the brakes on fly-by-night dumping vehicles. The move is expected to bring relief to residents and civic bodies that wake up to find mounds of debris or trash staring at them on busy streets.

 The culprits, often contractors and transporters who do not want to carry their unwanted consignments to dumping grounds far away from residential areas, will be caught on two cameras the BMC plans to place at several key points.

 According to additional municipal commissioner R.A. Rajeev, the spy cameras will go a long way in curbing the menace. Contractors who dont want to travel long distances simply dump the debris on flyovers. 

 Bids will soon be invited from firms to put up the cameras.

 Officially, the BMC says around 10,000 tonnes of debris is generated in the city daily. Half of this is dumped on deserted roads. We will also issue a stop-work notice to construction firms because they are responsible for getting rid of debris in a proper way, Rajeev said.

 Threat to beauty care queen

 After film stars and cricketers, beautician Shahnaz Husain is on the hit list of terror groups. At least, she claims so.

 In a letter to the home ministry and Delhi police, Husain has asked for security, claiming she was receiving threats from militant groups. 

 The terror groups want to target me because I use ayurveda to treat my customers and these people perceive the ancient science as a Hindu cure, she said. My job is perceived by them as not being Islamic. 

 She is married to a Hindu another reason for being targeted. 

 Husain had been given X-category security in December 2005 following a similar letter but it was withdrawn four months later. She had a personal security officer with her as long as she enjoyed the privilege.

 Janata meals on right track

 The Southern Railway has hit the Morarji Desai track. It has cooked up a cheap meal plan that is close to a failed scheme the former Prime Minister had dished out 30 years ago.

 The railways are offering Janata Meals at Rs 15 per plate at Chennai Central and four other stations in Tamil Nadu, including Madurai. 

 The packages on offer are typically south Indian sambar rice (200 gm) and curd rice (200 gm). The staple is spiced up with pickles.

 Plates are provided to those who want to eat during journeys. The meals are ready by 11 am. 

 It is a nice thing, but could be made even spicier with things like papad, a passenger at Chennai Central said between mouthfuls.

 The railways have a long way to go to beat the Janata governments one-rupee meals, but few are complaining about having to pay Rs 15 in these times of high prices.

 Water-shed

 Taps could run dry in some areas of Mumbai this Friday.

 The problem has arisen because of a three-hour construction work planned at Maharashtra State Electric Transmission Companys complex in Padghe. 

 Several areas in the city and Thane that receive water between 4 am and 2 pm will face a 30 per cent cut. Those getting supplies between 2 pm and 10 pm hours will not get water at all. 

 The supply squeeze isnt the first. Earlier this week, civic bodies announced a 20 per cent cut after water levels in lakes feeding the city dropped because of a delayed monsoon.

 Mumbai: If you are a sucker for seafood, make it a point to drop in at the Grand Mumbai festival. The spread at the Grands Intercontinental will be a foodies delight.

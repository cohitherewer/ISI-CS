 Suit for Tokyo blood money

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR

 New Delhi, Jan. 25: Descendants of people killed when the Japanese ruled the Andaman and Nicobar islands have moved the Supreme Court for a share of the money paid by Tokyo to settle Indian claims after World War II.

 A petition submitted before the apex court said the Centre had received two instalments of Rs 35 lakh and nine million yen (at present, 1 yen is worth Re 0.37) from Japan in 1952 and 1963, but the money was not disbursed to the families of those who lost their lives and property. 

 The Homfraygunj Martyrs Memorial Committee, a registered society of the victims, had approached the court after the Port Blair bench of Calcutta High Court dismissed their petition without going into the merits of the case. 

 A bench headed by Justice Tarun Chatterjee, which heard the matter today, asked the Centre and the Andaman administration to file their response. 

 The committee, named after Homfraygunj village where 44 Indians charged with espionage were killed in 1944, said one-third of the 33,772 people living in the Andamans were killed after the Japanese took over in 1942. They even took their money and gave fake Japanese currency in return.

 The petitioners, who cited several killings by the Japanese during their three-and-a-half-year rule, said they had been regularly requesting the government to take up the matter with Japan but nothing was forthcoming. 

 It was only during the NDA regime that they were informed the matter could not be taken up at the diplomatic level as Japan had already paid money to settle Indian claims. 

 In 2002, when the victims families sought the intervention of then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, they were told that according to agreements signed in 1952 and 1963, Japan had paid compensation for the genocide of Indians in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. 

 The petitioners alleged that the government had misappropriated the amount.

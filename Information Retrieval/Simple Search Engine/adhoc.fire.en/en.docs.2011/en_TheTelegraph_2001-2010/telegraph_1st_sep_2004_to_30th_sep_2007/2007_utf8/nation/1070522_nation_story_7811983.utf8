 Calcutta boy goes missing from train to Mumbai

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 21: Bhaskar Majumdar left his Birati home for Mumbai on May 11. Ten days later, he hasnt reached.

 Hoping to find a job, the 24-year-old boarded the holiday special train that arrived in Mumbai late on May 12.

 Swapan Surroy, Bhaskars maternal uncle who lives in Navi Mumbais Kharghar, claims his nephew called him on the evening of May 12 from Igatpuri.

 He asked me not to come to the station, saying a lady co-passenger had offered to drop him home. He said the lady lived in Jalwayu Vihar, the complex where I stay, said Surroy, an ex-navy officer.

 He added that he had tried to warn Bhaskar against taking lifts from strangers, but the line had snapped. 

 The next day, the Surroys approached the railway police at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, but were told to file a complaint in Igatpuri, a three-hour journey.

 On May 14, Surroy received a call from the lady who claimed to be Bhaskars friend. My nephew doesnt know anyone here, he said.

 She asked if Bhaskar had reached home. When I said he hadnt, she seemed surprised. She said she had offered him a lift, but had to back out when her husband came to pick her up at Kalyan.

 At a meeting on May 15, the lady made contradictory statements about Bhaskar. She gave her name as Tina Kinle but didnt give me her exact address. She suggested we take a tantriks help, Surroy said.

 In their May 17 police complaint in Igatpuri, the Surroys said they suspected Tina and her version of events. What has fuelled doubts is that she called to find out about Bhaskar so long after she had reached home.

 Bhaskars father had a heart attack recently and his mother has been unwell since he went missing. He has a younger brother.

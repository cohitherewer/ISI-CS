 Murder tag on sex test

 Mumbai, Sept. 6 (PTI): Bombay High Court today upheld an amendment to a law banning sex-determination tests that equates pre-natal sex determination with female foeticide. 

 Sex selection should be allowed to those who have one child and want another child of the opposite sex, a petition filed by Vijay Sharma and Kirti Sharma husband and wife had said.

 But the court said sex selection would be as good as female foeticide. That society should not want a girl child... is a matter of grave concern. Such a tendency offends a womans dignity.

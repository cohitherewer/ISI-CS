 Disbelief in kid street

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, July 31: Shakeel Raja paused in the middle of picking garbage, a slushy, multi-coloured plastic in his hand, and a look of shock and helplessness in his eyes. 

 He had just learnt that his friend and role model had been sentenced to six years in jail in faraway Mumbai. 

 Ho gaya (Its happened)? the 17-year-old asked this reporter, trying hard to maintain a stoic face, as others around him left their work and gathered together, equally stunned. 

 Ten months ago, Munnabhai had injected a dose of hope in Shakeel and his friends, taking them away, for a while, from their daily struggle for survival to a world where it was possible to dream. 

 A pall of gloom descended on these rag pickers as news of the conviction reached them.

 He gave us so much happiness. What can we do for him in his time of trouble? Kuch bhi nahi (nothing at all), mumbled 12-year-old Suleiman, whose parents are Bangladeshi migrants. 

 Sanjay had come down to two slum clusters in south Delhis Vasant Vihar and Badarpur last September to share jaadu ki jhappis with children who live the street life he mimics on screen. 

 The actor spent only half an hour with the kids before rushing off to other engagements. But, speaking in his typical tapori style, he won them over in no time.

 A month later though, Sanjay was back, and this time, he spent two hours convincing the rag pickers, most of whom have been exposed to drugs and other intoxicants at a young age, to stay saaf (clean). 

 He talked just like us. He asked us to call him Sanju bhai. He just didnt come across as a big man, Suleimans 16-year-old brother Habib said.

 JNU caste plot charge

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: Accused of sexual harassment, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University today claimed that he was being victimised by upper caste colleagues jealous of his professional abilities. 

 Four senior Brahmin colleagues have had problems with me since the day I joined. I am certain they are the people behind this conspiracy. The universitys inquiry will reveal this, Chaudhury Upendra Rao said. 

 Nine students at the universitys Special Centre for Sanskrit Studies have accused Rao of making their lives miserable. 

 Rao, the head of the centre when the accusations surfaced, has been removed from his post, but continues to remain on the faculty. 

 JNU authorities refused to comment on Raos allegations. 

 We will wait till the enquiry committee conducts its investigation. Any comments now may queer the pitch, a senior official said. 

 Rao has written to vice-chancellor B.B. Bhattacharya that he has evidence to back his allegations. 

 When the time comes, I will produce it (the evidence) to the enquiry team. There are other witnesses who are aware of the caste discrimination practised by some professors at the centre, he told The Telegraph. 

 The girls, in their complaint to Bhattacharya, have said that Rao often asked them to stay back late into the evenings at the centre if they wanted any academic assistance. 

 Rao has denied all charges. 

 The upper caste professors are using these children. I have never sexually harassed anyone. My entire life... my career... it is all being sullied by these false accusations, he said.

 Javed in Gujarat probe plea

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, May 29: Lyricist Javed Akhtar and social activist Shabnam Hashmi today moved the Supreme Court seeking an independent investigation into Gujarats fake encounters and demanding prosecution of the culprits.

 In their public interest petition, Akhtar (in picture) and Hashmi have alleged that attempts were being made at the highest level to cover up the crimes and to abet the cold-blooded murders. The aim, they say, is to glorify the chief minister and brand Muslims terrorists.

 It has become a trend in the state to demonise Muslims by declaring them dreaded terrorists and, thereafter, killing them in fake encounters, they have said.

 Threat stops IIM crowing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Bangalore, March 12: The Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, today set a precedent by not revealing the highest offer at its five-day placements that ended last evening.

 In a race to outdo each other, B-schools across the country have in recent years been trumpeting the highest salary offers, which crossed Rs 1 crore last year.

 But that changed when two graduates wrote to the institute that public disclosure of the offers they had received had drawn unwarranted attention to them and they feared a threat to their lives. One of them, Gaurav Agarwal, had an offer of Rs 85 lakh from Barclays Capital, London.

 Although this years highest offer wasnt revealed officially, sources said it was $220,000 (Rs 97.3 lakh). The students name was kept under wraps.

 One of the highlights was the large number of foreign companies including Arcelor-Mittal that came talent-hunting; another was the rejection of overseas offers by five students. All five turned down top finance companies and chose Indian firms in the same line of business.

 This is certainly an encouraging trend, said Sourav Mukherjee, chairperson, placements. More and more students are doing this maybe because of better career prospects.

 We are taking up jobs that interest us; we are not looking at the salary, said one of the five, Madhurjya Banerjee.

 Manasi Prasad, who rejected her pre-placement offer from her summer internship with Goldman Sachs, said she was happier in Bangalore than anywhere else. She is joining Standard Chartered Bank.

 More senior posts were up for grabs than at any time before. Deepak Goyal, with 11 years work experience behind him, is joining Dubais Sun group as vice-president. There were several offers for the post of general manager.

 Market watchdog Sebi, taking part in the placement process for the first time, offered two graduates jobs as business analyst.

 Of the 233 students, only one opted out of the placements. Chartered accountant Mahadev Chitale will work for an NGO, Spandana, that dispenses micro-credit.

 In all, 90 companies came headhunting. Among the overseas recruiters were Arthur D. Little, Al Ghanim industries, CIC International, Development Bank of Singapore, GM Shanghai, McKinsey, British Petroleum, American Express, Citigroup and Procter amp; Gamble.

 Arcelor-Mittal offered two students jobs in Trinidad. There were 60 overseas offers.

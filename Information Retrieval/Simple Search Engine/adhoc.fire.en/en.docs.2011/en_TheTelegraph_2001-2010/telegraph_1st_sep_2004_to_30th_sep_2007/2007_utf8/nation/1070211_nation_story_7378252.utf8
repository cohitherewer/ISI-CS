 Mumbai, Feb. 10: Tears rolled down Mehjabeen Shaikhs cheeks. 

 Nobody is born a terrorist. If you can show mercy for Sanjay Dutt, why not for us? she cried, as her school-going daughters comforted her.

 Twelve years have passed since her husband Salim Mira Shaikh was arrested in the 1993 Bombay blasts case. 

 Mehjabeen was among many relatives of blast accused who gathered in Mumbai today to demand parity at law and dropping of terror charges against their kin.

 He has already served 12 years. How much more do we need to suffer? Mehjabeen pleaded at a news conference organised by Raj Babbars party, Jan Morcha.

 The relatives voiced anger that Sanjay, who has been absolved of terror charges but convicted under the arms act, has been allowed to walk home while their kin were in jail.

 Our children are in jail for 14 years, said Farooq Pawles father Abdul Hamid. Now they should be released. Amina Sayeed, sister of convict Salim Durrani, said: We do not want Sanjay Dutt to be sentenced. But others should also be freed from terror charges.

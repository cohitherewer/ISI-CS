 SP leans Left for President

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Amar Singh

 New Delhi, June 1: The Samajwadi Party will not support a Congress candidate for President but may consider backing one from the Left, Amar Singh said today.

 But the party general secretary made it clear the Samajwadis would not have a problem if the Congress, too, endorsed the Left nominee.

 The party will not vote for someone from the National Democratic Alliance either, not even Bhairon Singh Shekhawat for whom, Amar said, he had the highest regard and respect.

 The party will take a call on the matter on June 6 at a meeting in Hyderabad with its new comrades: N. Chandrababu Naidu, Jayalalithaa, Om Prakash Chautala and Brindabon Goswami from Assam. Mulayam Singh Yadav will also attend the talks.

 Whatever decision is taken will be by consensus, Amar told a news conference.

 The Samajwadi Partys 60,000-odd votes in the presidential electoral college puts it on a par with the Bahujan Samaj Party. Even the Congress knows it is no pushover.

 Samajwadi Party sources said that despite the partys enmity with the Congress and its president Sonia Gandhi, Pranab Mukherjee would have been acceptable because of his gravitas, stature and the ability to rise above party considerations.

 But they added their party had no idea if Sonia wanted Mukherjee, also the Lefts first choice, at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 Among the other Congress probables, they rejected Shivraj Patil and Motilal Vora, recalling that Vora had, as governor in 1995, sacked Mulayam and installed Mayavati as chief minister.

 Amar acknowledged that after the Uttar Pradesh poll rout, his party was pinning its hopes on the so-called third front.

 What an irony of fate! With 14 MPs we had got four plum ministerships in the United Front government; now with 40 MPs we are twiddling our thumbs. This is what political isolation does to a party. So its better to be part of a front.

 The third front would try and prove its relevance in the presidential polls and then, in the 2009 general election, could play a critical role in a fractured Lok Sabha if it managed to win 100-odd seats, Amar said.

 He refused to react to the land controversy involving Amitabh Bachchan in Uttar Pradesh. Ask the person who is concerned. I am his brother but I have not been authorised to speak on it.

 But he looked rattled and did not utter a word against Mayavati or Sonia.

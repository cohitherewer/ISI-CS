 Gold Coast backlash on Indians

 Melbourne, July 7 (PTI): Patients at an Australian hospital have refused to be treated by Indian-trained medical staff after two Indian doctors employed there were questioned in connection with the failed terror plots in Britain. 

 Gold Coast Hospital staff, including medical registrars and residents, have released a statement in support of one of the two doctors, Mohammed Asif Ali, who was released by police without charge. The second doctor, Mohammed Haneef, is in police custody since Monday night.

 Doctors at the hospital said patients had refused to be treated by several of the Indian-trained medical staff, accusing them of having some connection to terrorism, the Australian daily reported.

 Queensland health minister Stephen Robertson, however, said only a few of the hospitals employees had been subject to racist treatment, which he condemned.

 Theyre pretty bruised, Robertson said. There is a sensitivity among some of those overseas-trained doctors that they may be subject to racism. Im hoping that wont be the case. Its not the Australian way.

 While hospital administrators have said Alis position there remains secure, neighbours who have spoken to him said he was uncertain if he would be able to return to work.

 In their statement of support, his colleagues said: The police made it clear there is nothing to suggest Ali has committed any offence. We have great trust and respect for our colleague and friend, and we all offer him our sincere support at this very difficult time.

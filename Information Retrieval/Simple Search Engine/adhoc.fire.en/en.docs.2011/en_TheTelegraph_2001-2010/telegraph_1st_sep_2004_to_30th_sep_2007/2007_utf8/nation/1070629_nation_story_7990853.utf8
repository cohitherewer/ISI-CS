 Maoist scare on Kalam visit eve

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, June 28: Detonator and explosive hauls in Hyderabad and the detection of an illegal Bangladeshi worker at the Sriharikota space centre put Andhra Pradesh police on alert a day before President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams visit.

 Three boxes of gelatine sticks were seized from a house near the Indian School of Business and Infosys campus today amid fears of an impending Maoist strike to avenge last weeks killing of their deputy chief, Rajamouli.

 The detonators 3,000 of them were found 20 km away at the home of a certain Ranga Reddy, who has been arrested.

 The police also detained 30-year-old Nazeer Alimulla, a Bangladeshi welder at the high-security space centre. The man without a passport, visa or work permit was hired on June 9 with four others by Calcutta-based contract labour company Sirplus.

 The company said it had no idea that Alimulla didnt have valid papers. The police said Sirplus had hired another illegal Bangladeshi worker last year, too, for work at the space centre.

 Kalam arrives tomorrow on a one-day visit to lay the foundation for a private medical equipment manufacturing company, Care Foundation, near Hyderabad.

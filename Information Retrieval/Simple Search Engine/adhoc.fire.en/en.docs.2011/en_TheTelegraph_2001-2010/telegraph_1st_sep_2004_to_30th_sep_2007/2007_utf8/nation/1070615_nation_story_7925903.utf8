 Aqeel freed, says lawyer

 Dubai, June 14 (PTI): DJ Aqeel was today discharged in a case of drug possession about two weeks after he was allegedly caught with Ecstasy tablets in his bag at the international airport, his lawyer claimed.

 Aqeel was honourably discharged by the prosecutor (the Indian equivalent of magistrate) as there was no sustainable evidence against him, Ashish Mehta said. The DJ was reportedly discharged after Mehta argued that the contraband was planted in his bag.

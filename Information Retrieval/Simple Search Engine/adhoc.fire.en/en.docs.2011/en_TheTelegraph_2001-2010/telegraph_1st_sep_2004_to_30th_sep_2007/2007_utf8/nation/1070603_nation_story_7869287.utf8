 Bastar blackout after blasts

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Raipur, June 2: A major part of Bastar was plunged into darkness after Maoists blew up three high-tension power supply towers.

 The attack comes in the wake of a similar explosion engineered by the rebels in Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. There is already an alert at power installations in neighbouring Jharkhand.

 The Naxalites blew up the power supply towers in the dense forests of Dhourie and Farasgaon on Thursday night. The reason for the blackout was detected by a helicopter only late last evening as the terrain is inaccessible by road.

 Work to restore electricity supply began this morning. Officials said it would take four to seven days. 

 The blackout has paralysed life in tribal-dominated Bastar. Civic bodies have not been able to operate pump houses and people have had to walk miles in search of water.

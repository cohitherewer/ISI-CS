 Shilpa tormentor files for India visa

 AMIT ROY 

 Jade Goody

 London, Jan. 23: Indian government ministers may have a few other things to worry about Assam, Kashmir, investment in infrastructure, etc. etc. but, first, they will have to decide on the most important foreign affairs issue of all: whether to give Jade Goody a visa. 

 The ousted contestant from Celebrity Big Brother, who is now donning sackcloth and ashes for having given Shilpa Shetty a hard time, really means it when she says she would like to go to India. 

 A spokesman for her management agency in London, John Noel, revealed to The Telegraph: We have put in an application for a visa. We are waiting to hear. 

 It is understood that the decision will be made in Delhi. 

 This wont be Jades first trip to India. She was there in May last year when she was part of a programme for Living TV. 

 The bottles for her perfume (Shh..) are made in India, the spokesman pointed out. 

 Today, in an interview on a morning chat show, Wright Stuff, presented by Matthew Wright, who shares an agent with Jade, she indicated that she wanted to go to India in an effort to build better race relations. Im thinking about going over there because Ive been invited over there, said Jade. I dont know who by but they are high-up people. 

 The invitation was contained in an open letter to Jade Goody and friends from the India Tourism Office in London which was published in the Evening Standard, London Lite and Metro (two giveaway papers), Times, Independent, Guardian and The Daily Telegraph. 

 India does not want to provoke a riot by allowing in Jade for she has said some nasty things to Shilpa. On the other hand, having invited her, India will come across as singularly mean spirited if Jade is denied a visa. The land, which let in Salman Rushdie, should surely be able to deal with a 25-year-old mother of two who has sent her sorryness to Shilpas parents, many Indians will say. 

 The mother of two clearly wants to use India to repair her shattered image as a celebrity, whereas India could turn her into a brand ambassador. Both sides could benefit from such a trip. 

 But where would she go? 

 Indian tourism officials suggest 10-12 days in the Golden Triangle, taking in Delhi, Agra and Rajasthan (may be the Rambagh Palace in Jaipur or the Lake Palace in Udaipur, where she could have evening cocktails with a little poppadom). 

 And if she were to take in Calcutta, once the centre of the British empire young memsahibs like Jade once sailed out from England to find suitable husbands from officer ranks it would certainly be interesting to witness Jade order room service, say, at the Taj Bengal (Shorov Poppadom can wait, I want my fishfingers and chips, now!). 

 Then, according to the Indian Tourism Offices recommended itinerary, she could make her way to Ananda, near Rishikesh, in the Himalayas, which has one of the best spas in the world. 

 There she could do yoga, meditation and have ayurvedic treatment, suggested an official. 

 Given the wording of the open letter, which was noticeably Gandhian in tone, Jades visa application can hardly be turned down. 

 Dear Jade Goody, Once your current commitments are over, may we invite you to experience the healing nature of India, it began. 

 It said: Being one of the worlds oldest civilisations, our land is one where the ancient and the modern co-exist and a multitude of religions live in harmony. As a beauty therapist, you may be especially interested in visiting one of the many spas where you can cleanse your stresses away, enjoy yoga in the land that invented it and experience ayurvedic healing which promotes positive health and natural beauty. 

 The letter ended: The best way to understand Incredible India is to visit and we look forward to welcoming you soon. 

 That last wish may be granted very soon.

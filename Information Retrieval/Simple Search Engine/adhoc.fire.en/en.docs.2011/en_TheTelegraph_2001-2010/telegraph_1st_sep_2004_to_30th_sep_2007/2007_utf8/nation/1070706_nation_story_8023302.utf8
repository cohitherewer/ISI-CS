 Delhi offers probe help

 Singh (top), Brown: Standing together 

 New Delhi, July 5: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has spoken to his British counterpart Gordon Brown and offered him help to nail down the possible Indian connection in the terror attacks in the UK.

 Having been a victim of terrorism for long, India seems to be taking a proactive approach with its offer to exchange information on the Indians allegedly involved in the Glasgow incidents.

 In an interaction with women journalists in the capital today, the Prime Minister made it clear that terrorists have no nationality or religion, but was quick to warn that attempts at racial profiling must be discouraged.

 Labelling Indians and Pakistanis as terrorists, such labels should best be avoided. Terrorists are terrorists, whether they are Indian or Pakistani, Muslims or non-Muslims. One could not disown ones past, but it should not be rubbed in too closely, he said.

 Just because a couple of Indians have been picked up should not lead one to conclude that all Indians are terrorists. The community should not be targeted. That creates a new sense of grievance. I am a Sikh and I felt the trauma and hurt of my community when they were labelled terrorists, he said.

 Singh, speaking on several issues during the hour-long interaction, said in a lighter vein that his comments never got the full publicity they may deserve. The issues he dwelt on ranged from the threat Pakistan was now facing (Lal Masjid clashes) to the fact that there were no files on the matter of appointing Shiv Shankar Menon as foreign secretary.

 On the Lal Masjid crackdown in Islamabad, the Prime Minister refused to draw any similarities with Operation Bluestar. He would only say that Pakistan was already facing a very difficult situation and that he didnt want to make matters worse by commenting on it.

 However, he recalled once telling Pervez Musharraf that terrorism was a common enemy faced by both India and Pakistan. Pakistan aided and abetted terrorism in India, and now the mess within was there for all to see. The threat has turned inwards. I wish Pakistan succeeded in tackling this, he said.

 Singh said the dialogue with the neighbour was a free, frank and fearless one, but added that it had slowed down recently, not because of India but the situation in Pakistan.

 On the nuclear deal negotiations with the US, he said national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and foreign secretary Menon will travel to Washington later this month to sort out two or three remaining issues. US secretary of state Condoleezza Rices deadline of finalising the deal by the end of the year could be advanced, Singh said. 

 There were some light moments in the interaction, too. One of those was on IFS officer Veena Sikris application under the right to information act to know the procedure of appointing Menon, who superseded Sikri and 15 others, foreign secretary last year. I am an affected party, how can I comment on this, the Prime Minister said to ripples of laughter.

 He was referring to the fact that the central administrative tribunal as well as the information commissioner had called for all files related to the matter from the Prime Ministers Office. However, when the questioner persisted with the issue, Singh merely said: In any case, there are no files on this subject.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Yorkshire springs Bollywood coup

 AMIT ROY

 Harewood House which will host some of the stars.

London, June 5: Tom Riordan, chief executive of Yorkshire Forward, the development agency which works to attract business investment into Englands largest county, is a happy man.

 We beat New York, he said. 

 Winning the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) awards may not be quite the same thing as getting the Olympics but as far as Riordan is concerned, it is much more important. 

 There will be 50 events, including a joint Ficci-Yorkshire Forward global business forum on Thursday and the main Oscar ceremony on Saturday, in this years IIFA, which is spread around the Yorkshire cities of Leeds, Sheffield, Bradford, York and Hull.

 Much of the Indian investment into the UK is now routed via London but post-IIFA, Riordan hopes some of it will come Yorkshires way. On paper, at least, many of Indias infrastructural and economic requirements, especially in the field of clean energy, are met by Yorkshire. 

 At 39 and he got the job two years ago Riordan is a youthful CEO. My background is in climate change. I negotiated on behalf of the UK on biodiversity and climate change in the UK and in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, so I am well aware of the dynamics between a country like India and a country like the UK.

 With President George W. Bush now putting the heat on India and apparently becoming a late convert to the cause of climate change, Delhi may have to do a lot more to show it is with the West on the need to tackle global warming. And this is where Riordan says Yorkshire could help. 

 We have a heritage in coal extraction and in steel production and basically dealing with the environmental effects of heavy industry, he explained to The Telegraph. 

 In Yorkshire, we produce more energy than we import. We believe we can hook up Indian companies and India generally at government level with ourselves on this agenda to try and push forward the boundaries of things like carbon capture. 

 It is basically about still burning the coal but then capturing it in a way that does not put CO2 into the atmosphere either making it into a solid or a liquid or something that can be stored. 

 (At a very basic level, it would mean that the problem of pollution pouring into the atmosphere from the malfunctioning Milk Colony depot in Belgachia in north Calcutta, about which residents have complained repeatedly, would be resolved.) 

 Riordan, who is to sign an MoU with Ficci on Thursday, said: It is a huge issue for India and India is taking it incredibly seriously. 

 As to why he (as well as local authorities in Yorkshire plus the Yorkshire Tourist Board) had invested heavily in bringing IIFA to the county, he displayed the typical frankness of the Yorkshireman.

 The principal one is that India is the second fastest growing economy in the world, he said. There are huge commercial opportunities for our financial services, our environmental companies and others to build long-term relationships. The real wealth creators are business. 

 He spoke of tie-ups at an academic level, for example between universities like Calcutta and any of the nine, including Leeds, Sheffield and York, in Yorkshire (incidentally, Amitabh will be given an honorary degree along with Yash Chopra and Shabana Azmi by Leeds Metropolitan University).

 Goon gets Cong ticket

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Aug. 6: Last April, Rahul Gandhi had vowed to end the gun culture that had taken over Uttar Pradesh politics.

 Less than four months later, his party has fielded a don-turned-politician from Farrukhabad for the August 19 Assembly bypoll, triggering tension within the state Congress.

 Many party workers believe Vijay Singh, a convicted murderer out on bail, got the ticket only because he won the seat twice earlier. Singh, convicted of killing a BJP leader, first won the seat as an Independent. In the last state polls, he won on a Samajwadi ticket.

 After the BSPs victory, Singh resigned as MLA and joined Mayavatis party, necessitating the bypoll. But Mayavati showed him the door as she didnt want a criminal in her party. Singh had no option but to seek a ticket from the Congress. Unfortunately, we obliged him, said a Congress leader.

 Spokesman Akhilesh Singh, however, said the Congress could not find a willing candidate after the electoral drubbing.

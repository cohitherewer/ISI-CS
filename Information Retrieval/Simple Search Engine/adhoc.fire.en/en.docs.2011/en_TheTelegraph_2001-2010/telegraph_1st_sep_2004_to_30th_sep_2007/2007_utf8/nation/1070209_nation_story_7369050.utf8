 Take-off crash at air show, pilot safe

 Bangalore, Feb. 8: The Aero India show suffered a hiccup and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) took a knock when its intermediate jet trainer skidded off the runway and landed on its belly this afternoon.

 However, the pilot escaped unhurt.

 This is the second mishap in two weeks at the Yelahanka airbase on the outskirts of Bangalore, and both involved HALs machines.

 On February 2, a Dhruv helicopter had plummeted to the ground while practising for the show, killing one pilot and injuring another. HALs pride was dealt its first blow at the air show.

 Todays crash left its reputation in ruins.

 Squadron Leader Baldev Singh, HALs chief test pilot (fixed wing), was in the cockpit when the orange aircraft rose a few feet off the ground and slammed back on to the runway. The impact was such that one of the three tyres burst and veered the aircraft off to a patch of mud. 

 When it came to a halt, two oleos (tubular rods on which the airframe rests) collapsed and the jet trainer landed on its belly.

 Fire-tenders and an ambulance rushed to the spot. By then, Singh had opened the canopy, climbed on to one of the wings, jumped off and walked away. The jet trainers display was slotted between 3.10 and 3.17 pm. 

 We saw the pilot even as the dust settled as he had opened the canopy and jumped down. By then, the tenders arrived and sprayed water to prevent the fully-fuelled aircraft from catching fire, said an aviation expert, who was part of a team of journalists on board a business jet. 

 HAL has not given any reasons for the crash yet. Singh has been taken to hospital for a check-up. 

 The crash also gave the Americans a scare as the aircraft landed near a C17 Globemaster, P38 Orion and a C-130 Hercules, which were part of a static display.

 I wonder what would have happened if the Indian aircraft had veered off a few metres earlier. I am sure it would have hit and damaged our aircraft, a US serviceman said.

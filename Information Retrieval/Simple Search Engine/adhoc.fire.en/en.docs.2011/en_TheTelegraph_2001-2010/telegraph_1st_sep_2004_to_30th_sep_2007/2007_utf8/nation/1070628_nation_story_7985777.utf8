 Nod for Dera chief arrest

 Chandigarh, June 27 (PTI):

 The Punjab government tonight cleared the arrest and prosecution

 of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh . The nod

 came after Sikh religious heads rejected his fresh apology.

 Formal permission for the prosecution of the Dera head has been given, B.C. Gupta, Punjabs principal secretary (home), said.

 The clearance came hours after the Akal Takht, the highest temporal body of Sikhs, turned down the apology Gurmeet made for having dressed like Guru Gobind Singh.

 Panels clear N-deal, Left wants to see text

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, July 25: The Indo-US nuclear deal received the first formal and easy seal of approval within the country today with the cabinet committees on political affairs and security clearing it after the Prime Minister briefed them.

 The less easy part began in the evening when Manmohan Singh and a team of officials, including atomic energy chief Anil Kakodkar, sounded Left leaders.

 The Left leaders said they would make up their mind after seeing the text of the deal, a copy of which is expected to be given to them soon. As several technical details are involved, the Lefts think-tank will vet the text to help the parties crystallise their opinion.

 Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said Singh would soon brief BJP leaders Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and Jaswant Singh.

 The Prime Ministers Office had not contacted Opposition leaders since the Indian team returned from Washington over the weekend, opening itself to the charge of being exclusive, not inclusive.

 The Congress had made the same charge against the BJP after the 1998 nuclear tests as then Prime Minister Vajpayee did not brief his predecessors in what was described as a nationalist step. 

 All concerns of India have been reflected and adequately addressed, Mukherjee told reporters after the meeting of the cabinet committees this afternoon.

 He said Delhis bottom line on reprocessing spent fuel, lifetime guarantees of fuel supply as well as the implicit acknowledgement of Indias right to test would be incorporated in the agreement.

 The text of the agreement was shown to all cabinet ministers, the foreign minister said, adding that it would be tabled in Parliament on August 10, the first day of the next session.

 Pramod widow injects Rs 1-cr angle

 Mumbai, April 10: Rekha Mahajan today said her brother-in-law Praveen, accused of killing her husband Pramod Mahajan, had demanded Rs 1 crore from him.

 The slain BJP leaders widow made the disclosure during her re-examination by special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam. She had not revealed this in her statement to police on April 27, 2006.

 In the packed courtroom of additional sessions judge Srihari Davare, Rekha said Praveen had visited her 11th floor home in Worli 10 days before the shootout and demanded the money.

 When Pramod Mahajan asked him why he needed such a large sum and expressed displeasure, he got furious and threatened him with dire consequences, she said.

 Rekha earlier told defence counsel Harshad Ponda that she tried to push Praveen out of the house after he fired three shots at Pramod Mahajan from his licensed revolver. 

 Meetula sangitla hota, tu aikle nahin. Atta phal bhog (I had warned you, but you did not listen to me. Now face the consequences), she recalled Praveen as saying in Marathi.

 Nikam intervened at this point and sought permission to re-examine Rekha, who is among the 56 prosecution witnesses in the case. He told the judge fresh information had been given voluntarily by the witness and could lead to further evidence.

 After this, Rekha revealed that Praveen had visited her Worli apartment around 9.30 pm on April 12, 2006, and demanded the sum.

 Following the revelation, the defence counsel continued the cross-examination and accused the prosecution of tutoring the witness.

 Rekha, however, denied this, saying she had not revealed the information either to the police or to her relatives initially.

 But a few days after Pramod Mahajans death, she had apparently told his brother-in-law Gopinath Munde about the incident.

 Earlier, the defence counsel pointed out alleged discrepancies in the prosecution case and tried to establish that Rekha was not present in the house when her husband was shot and had learnt about the murder later.

 The defence claimed Rekhas police statement did not reveal details of Pramod Mahajans conversation with Munde when he was conscious and was being taken to the Hinduja hospital. Pramod Mahajan had apparently asked Munde what he had done to be fired at by Praveen.

 Rekha said she did not say as much as the police had not specifically questioned her about it.

 Pramod Mahajan was allegedly shot by Praveen, his youngest brother, on the morning of April 22, 2006, and succumbed to injuries on May 3 at the Hinduja hospital.

 Minutes after the shootout, Praveen had taken a taxi to Worli police station, 10 minutes away, and surrendered. He had also handed in his licensed revolver.

 Rekha is the first prosecution witness in the murder trial that started last month. Munde and Pramod Mahajans daughter Poonam are also among the witnesses put up by the prosecution.

 With the completion of Rekhas cross-examination, it is likely that either these two or Pramod Mahajans domestic help Mahesh Wankhede will be examined tomorrow.

 Rebels new face: laptop Maoist

 - Tech college dropouts posed as public sector 

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Jan. 13: Used to encounters with Maoists with guns, police yesterday encountered Maoists with laptops.

 The guns were there, too an armoury of rifles, pistols, grenades and rocket launchers being assembled according to the designs on three computers.

 A joint raid by three states police on a house in Bhopal last evening has thrown up the Maoist-as-techie.

 There were six of them, three young men and three women, all engineering college dropouts from small Andhra Pradesh towns such as Warangal and Vijayawada, an officer said here.

 Their neighbours in the middle-class neighbourhood in Bhopal said the six Maoists had passed themselves off as three young couples who worked with public sector companies.

 Inside the house, they had virtually built an arms factory, police said.

 They were working with two laptops, a desktop and a photocopier. We found a mountain of guns, rocket launchers and grenades. The Maoists also had designs for spare parts. After they assembled the weapons in the house, the arms were transferred to Chhattisgarh, Andhra and Orissa, said an officer who was part of the Madhya Pradesh-Orissa-Andhra police raid.

 The arrest of the six, which came on a tip-off, led to the capture of five of their comrades at a village near Orissas Rourkela. This squad of two men and three women, too, was assembling rifles.

 The arrests have revealed the latest trend among the Maoists, the police said.

 In September, the police had busted a rocket parts-manufacturing racket involving several foundries at the Ambattur small-industry zone in Chennais suburbs. This was preceded by seizures of huge consignments of rockets and launchers across Andhra.

 Now they have spread their activities to middle-class neighbourhoods in cities, an officer said.

 The arrested rebels were to be produced in courts at Bhopal, Bhubaneswar and Khammam in Andhra.

 The police said that the five held in Orissa possessed maps of the Rourkela Steel Plant and several police and Central Reserve Police Force establishments.

 Throughout last night, the Andhra police kept denying reports that they had caught CPI (Maoist) secretary Ganapati and Sudhakar, the chief of the rebels Andhra-Orissa border squads.

 Folk singer and radical activist Gadar and civil rights leader P. Varavara Rao have appealed to the state home minister for a promise that the Maoist leaders, if they are in police hands, would not be shot but produced before a court.

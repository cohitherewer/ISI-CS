 Farmer Amitabh breathes land fire

 - Bachchan says he is ready to go to jail 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Amitabh Bachchan: Others do it, why cant I?

 Mumbai, Aug. 12: Amitabh Bachchan today defended his farmland acquisitions, insisting the deals were clean and he was being singled out for attack.

 Surely, there has to be a definition, there are millions of people who own agricultural land, and who do not go down on their hands and knees and till the earth, Bachchan told television channels.

 The actors purchase of agricultural land in Uttar Pradesh was declared illegal by a state court in June. In Maharashtra, the other state where Bachchan owns farmland, only farmers are allowed to buy such land so he had got himself certified as one.

 His outburst, days after he won a national award for Black, is the first since October 2004 when he had described himself as a lowly commoner before the Nehru-Gandhi family. They are the rulers, we are commoners, Bachchan had said.

 The remarks were made after his wife Jaya spoke about how her husband had been left to fend for himself at the height of the Bofors scandal.

 Asked if his proximity to Samajwadi Party leaders Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh was the reason for recent controversies over income-tax dues and land deals, Bachchan said: Why do you only relate it today? And if you relate it that way, how would you explain it that I was hounded for Bofors. It was at that time that Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister and he was my friend.

 I fought single-handedly against the government and defeated them. I dont see why anyone wants to be political with me. Amar Singh is a person of his own merit and has his own politics. If you think by ostracising me you are diminishing somebody else, it is a fallacy.

 Asked about Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavatis statement that the land in Barabanki doesnt belong to him, Bachchan said he had a certificate from the district magistrate confirming ownership. 

 The certificate (for the Barabanki plots) was required for the land I was purchasing in Maharashtra. I submitted that to them, they studied it and they gave me a possession document. Everything was fine Two or three years later, they suddenly say the certificate is wrong. How does anyone function in a situation like this? 

 Bachchan expressed surprise how a change in government (Uttar Pradesh) suddenly requires a change in documentation. How do you function? Every time there is a change of government, everything that has passed before, or documentation that has been given to you as permission to continue doing your work, has to stop. 

 The actor chose not to mention that a previous district magistrate had dismissed his claim to the Barabanki land on the grounds that it was reserved for poor and landless peasants. But the officer was transferred by the Mulayam government and his successor ordered status quo on the deal. 

 Bachchan said he was ready to go to jail but couldnt understand how it would help anyone. If they are ready to arrest me, Ill go to jail. But I cant see what they would gain by arresting me. I am not going to fight the next election.

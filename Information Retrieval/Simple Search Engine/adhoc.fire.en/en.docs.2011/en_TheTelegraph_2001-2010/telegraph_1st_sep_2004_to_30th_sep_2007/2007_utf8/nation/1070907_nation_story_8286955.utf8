 Poll in air, aam aadmi takes pride of place at cabinet table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The 

 Union cabinet tonight came up with more lollies for the 

 aam aadmi a scholarship for poor Dalits, jobs for 

 villages and health insurance for unorganised sector workers.

 Dalit students who get admission into professional courses in private institutions on merit will have their fees paid by the government, finance minister P. Chidambaram revealed. 

 So far, the post-matriculation scholarship covered only government colleges but the Eleventh Five-Year Plan has been changed to include private institutes, he said. 

 Only students from poor families will be eligible and the scholarship will not apply to capitation-fee seats. Expenses on books, hostel fees, extra-curricular activities, etc., will not be covered.

 But the fees alone would make a big difference, Chidambaram said. In Andhra Pradesh, government medical colleges charge Rs 10,000 a year for an MBBS course while private colleges charge Rs 30,000, he pointed out. We are expanding the opportunities for SC students.

 Admission would be solely on merit, the minister said. There will be no dilution of standards.

 Rs 5,000 crore will be set aside for the scholarships there is no cap on their number and all eligible students will get one. So far, 1.3 crore students in government institutions have benefited.

 It is a very important scheme. We must ensure an increase in the enrolment because as against a national average of 10 per cent, only 5 per cent Scheduled Caste students enrol, he said.

 The health insurance scheme is aimed at below-poverty-line families with five or more members and will be launched on October 2, Mahatma Gandhis birth anniversary.

 The Unorganised Sector Workers Social Security Bill will have to be amended for the scheme. The amendment is likely to be introduced in the current session, scheduled to end on September 14 though there has been talk that it might end sooner.

 A grant of Rs 445 crore for the Rural Employment Generation Programme, projected to create 7.04 lakh more jobs in villages in 2007, was also cleared tonight.

 Last week, the cabinet had cleared the aam aadmi bima yojana (insurance scheme) for families below the poverty line. 

 Through these policies, the Congress hopes to blunt the edge of the Left and the Opposition campaign against the government. The two have accused the Centre of failing to rein in inflation.

 As relations with the Left have soured over the nuclear deal, the ruling coalition is bracing for early elections.

 Lucknows Babli and bahu

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, April 20: The aspiring actress who slashed her wrist in front of Prateeksha claiming Abhishek Bachchan had cheated her was once married to Shia scholar Kalbe Sadiqs son.

 All-India Muslim Personal Law Board vice-president Sadiq today said Jahnavi Kapoor was his one-time daughter-in-law Haya Rizvi, who left Lucknow to chase her Bollywood dreams in Bunty Aur Babli style.

 She was somewhat insanely drawn to the world of glamour. I tried for a while to cure her of her obsession. It is sad she has landed in such a mess, Sadiq said.

 Sadiqs son Kalbe Hussain ducked the media. His brother, Shameel Shamsi, said Hussain and Haya married in 1997 and had a son three years later. In 2002, they went in for a divorce after an unhappy marriage, he said. It was quite a troubled marriage. Haya could never adjust with the Kalbe family, Shamsi said.

 Haya, daughter of lawyer Mohsin Rizvi, was born in Lucknows Chowk area and spent her childhood and early youth there. Hussain claimed he was not allowed to see his son.

 Hayas father said she was suffering from depression and todays incident was apparently an outcome of this ailment.

 Psychoanalysts say Haya could be suffering from a personality disorder called erotomania in which a patient fantasises that he/she is involved with a celebrity. 

 Such patients are generally depressed and on medication, M.K. Mehta, a psychoanalyst said. Their depression is related with failure in achieving goals. They were prone to relating incidents that had not happened in a very credible manner, he said.

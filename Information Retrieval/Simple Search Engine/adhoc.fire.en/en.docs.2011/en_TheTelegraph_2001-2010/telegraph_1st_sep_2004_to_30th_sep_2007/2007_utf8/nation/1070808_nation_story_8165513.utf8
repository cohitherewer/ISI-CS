 Singh set to skip UN ritual

 New Delhi, Aug. 7: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will in all probability not attend the UN General Assembly scheduled to meet next month in New York.

 Official sources said Singh is not inclined to attend the session because there is no big attraction on the sidelines that is, no high-profile meetings that usually nudge the main event out of the news.

 The Prime Minister, the sources added, was not interested in putting in a ritualistic appearance at a yearly jamboree and indulge in some bhashan baaji (speech) for the record.

 Singh has asked Pranab Mukherjee to fill in for him. The foreign minister will probably stay on in New York till October 2, when Sonia Gandhi is expected to speak at the UN on Mahatma Gandhis legacy.

 October 2 is Gandhis birthday and India has persuaded 142 countries to co-sponsor a resolution proposing that the day be named International Non-Violence Day.

 Nobody would go on record but, in Congress circles, it is being said that the low-key Singh wished to yield the public space at the UN to facilitate Sonias high-profile international debut.

 Singh did not attend the General Assembly last year, too. He chose to be politically correct and travel to Brazil and Cuba to please the CPM and the Congresss anti-US constituency which, at that point, felt a bit uncomfortable about the Indo-American nuclear deal.

 This time round, expediency has apparently got the better of Singh in negotiating Indias place in the global arena.

 The sources pointed out that Singh has already had one-to-one meetings with the US and Russian Presidents, George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin, on the sidelines of the G-8 summit in Germany last June.

 An interaction with Pervez Musharraf could have been the only other talking point. But the word from the government was the Pakistan President was unlikely to travel to New York because of domestic pre-occupations.

 As for a meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao, Singh is scheduled to visit China in November as part of a bilateral visit.

 The sources said the Prime Minister is likely to travel to South Africa for the IBSA (India-Brazil-South Africa) summit. Next, he is scheduled to visit Malaysia for the India-Asean summit. 

 Singh, the sources said, is keen to work out a consensus formula to speed up a free trade agreement with the Asean bloc. Pakistan is reportedly pressuring Malaysia to strike a hard bargain with India.

 Back home, Singh is expected to make a statement on the nuclear deal in Parliament on August 13.

 Sources close to Singh said he has been invited to visit Bushs ranch in Texas from August 26 to 28. Singh, they added, indicated to the US President that he would visit the ranch at a mutually worked out later date.

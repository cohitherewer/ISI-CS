 Mulayam brush with trust vote first

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mulayam

 Lucknow, Feb. 25: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav may create history of sorts by seeking a trust vote tomorrow amid a boycott call by all Opposition parties and en masse resignation of BSP legislators.

 There has been no demand for the confidence vote from any Opposition party but his government has embarked on the unique trust vote after the Supreme Court disqualified 13 MLAs early this month.

 This may be the first time that a second confidence vote is being sought in a single session. Mulayam had won the first on January 25. 

 If all Opposition parties remain outside the House during the trust vote tomorrow, it will be the first such incident in Uttar Pradesh, said a former legislator.

 Even as they finalise their stand on the trust vote, hectic parleys have started between the parties on seat-sharing barely four days after the announcement of the Uttar Pradesh poll dates. Among them are the Congress, V.P. Singhs Jan Morcha and Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD).

 As part of a deal, the Jan Morcha and the RLD will share 150 seats, while the Congress will contest the remaining 253. Of the 150, the RLD has agreed to settle for 50 with the rest going to the Jan Morcha.

 The Congress has demanded all the seats of its 24 sitting MLAs, at least three seats in the constituency of each of the partys 11 MPs and 50 other seats in which it had come second in the 2002 elections.

 Although the deal is almost final, sources said a meeting between the Congress high command, Ajit Singh and the V.P. Singh-Raj Babbar combine is scheduled on Tuesday in the capital. It is believed this meeting will put a seal on the deal.

 The Congress has identified areas where it hopes to improve. In western Uttar Pradesh, the target is the Bareilly-Moradabad-Shahjehanpur belt and in central Uttar Pradesh, it is the Allahabad-Kanpur-Jalone-Mainpuri areas. Varanasi, Mirzapur-Basti, Rae Bareli-Sultanpur and Amethi have been listed as its prime focus areas.

 The RLD, which began negotiations with a demand for 80 seats, is happy with its 50. 

 The Jan Morcha, a conglomerate of 15 parties, will have 100 seats to distribute among its member parties. Key among its allies are Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party, Lalu Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Indian Justice Party.

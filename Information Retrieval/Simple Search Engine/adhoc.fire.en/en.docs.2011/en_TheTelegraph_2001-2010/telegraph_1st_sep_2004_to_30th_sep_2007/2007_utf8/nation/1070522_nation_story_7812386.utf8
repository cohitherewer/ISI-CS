 New Delhi, May 21: As the United Progressive Alliance government enters its fourth year in office, it appears that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is in the mood to reflect, introspect, speak some harsh truths and hold out hope for the next two years.

 Singh is not expected to gush over the 9 per cent economic growth, and is likely to be candid about the price rise, dwell at length on inclusive growth and steer clear of prickly issues such as reservation for Other Backward Class students.

 The Prime Minister will release his governments Report to the People at his residence tomorrow at a special programme, which will be attended by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, her party colleagues and Singhs ministers.

 The report is a ritual the government has observed for the past two years.

 The Prime Minister is expected to express satisfaction at the economic growth rate of over 8.5 per cent for the fifth year running and the recent accelerated growth of 9 per cent.

 But the report will recognise that a high national growth does not automatically address the challenges of unemployment, poverty and lack of balance in regional development. Nor does growth on its own lead to human development.

 This theme has been a refrain in the speeches the Prime Minister has made over the past one year.

 The report is also likely to state that the price rise is a matter of concern.

 A handful of ministries such as agriculture, rural development, urban development, communications, railways and surface transport might come in for praise.

 The section on foreign affairs is expected to cite on the credit side the inclusion of Afghanistan as a Saarc member, meaningful and constructive dialogue with Pakistan and the dialogue with the Persian bloc.

 The Indo-US nuclear deal will probably be projected as proof of strengthening ties, but the emphasis will be on how it would ensure Indias access to high technology and mark a turning point in its history.

 The report is also expected to dwell at length on the implementation of the Sachar committees report and the governments 15-point programme for minorities with the thrust on access to micro-credit and education.

 Although the Left insists that the government has a long way to go in implementing the national common minimum programme, the Prime Minister is likely to assert that at the end of five years, his government will have achieved much more than what it had been tasked with.

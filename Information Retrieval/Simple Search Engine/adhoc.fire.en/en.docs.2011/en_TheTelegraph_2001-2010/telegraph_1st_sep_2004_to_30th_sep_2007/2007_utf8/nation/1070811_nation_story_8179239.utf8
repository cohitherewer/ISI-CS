 Taslima protest worries UP cops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Aug. 10: Taslima Nasreens plan to visit Allahabad University on August 14 has got state police worried after a demonstration in front of the campus today.

 Allahabad police have been alerted on the possibility of an attack on the exiled Bangladeshi writer, who has had a reward put on her head by a cleric.

 Taslima had been the target of missiles from activists of the Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen, led by three MLAs, at a book release in Hyderabad yesterday.

 Today, a group of Muslim students and clerics gathered outside the campus, shouted slogans against her and burnt her effigy. The protesters left before the police arrived. The university authorities have approached the state administration for security.

 We are in touch with the district police and adequate security arrangements would be made for the programme, state home secretary Sarbesh Mishra said.

 Allahabad police have sent an intelligence report to the state home department, saying a group of clerics have been trying to communalise the atmosphere and instigate people against the writer.

 At Bareilly on March 15, the president of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (Jadeed), Maulana Tauqeer Raza Khan, had announced a Rs 5-lakh reward for anyone who would behead Taslima.

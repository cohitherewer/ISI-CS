 Chandigarh, March 7: It was the last hurrah for B-57 Canberra today as the low-flying bomber roared over air forces Presidents Fleet review, the first such event in 30 years. 

 Wing Commander S.K. Mathur darted the plane into a loop-like trajectory, drawing the figure of 8 in the sky. 

 The Canberra, despite being a bomber, was only used for reconnaissance or electronic surveillance missions. It ran several sorties in the 1962 (China), 1965 (Pakistan) and 1971 (Pakistan) wars, besides being deployed in the struggle to liberate Goa from the Portuguese in 1961. The plane also took part in the Kargil conflict. 

 You are, perhaps, witnessing the last display of the aircraft before it retires, said Padamjit Singh Ahluwalia, a top official of the air forces Western Command. British Air Force phased out the Canberra only last year.

 This mornings Presidential review only the fourth so far saw all types of aircraft in static and aerial displays. The last review was held in Chandigarh on January 19, 1976. President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed presided. The first was on April 1, 1954, and the second on April 1, 1972.

 As he marvelled at the air games, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam spelt out his vision of the Indian Air Force in 2025. I visualise the Indian Air Force of the year 2025 to be based on our scientific and technological competence. The Indian Air Force, by the year 2025, will be a model air force for the rest of the world to emulate, endowed with the very best of technology, alert and agile.

 The government, Kalam said, was committed to modernising equipment and adding force multipliers to enhance the operational performance and improving safety measures. The nation is with you and will lead you to modernise aerial platforms and ground support systems so that you will excel in aerial warfare, he added.

 Later, after a photo session with Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi and commanding officers, Kalam said he was confident the role of the air force would increase in the future.

 Asked whether he was thinking on a second stint at Rashtrapati Bhavan, Kalam skirted the query by saying: You should be asking which aircraft I would be flying next.

 At the show held to mark 50 years of the service to the nation other eye-catchers were Heron, the unmanned aerial vehicle, trainers for the latest Sukhois and transport aircraft from Avro and Dornier stables. The workhorses AN-32 to the heavylift IL-76 were also showcased.

 Forces push for a raise

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 19: The armed forces have asked the Centre for a hike of 2.5 times the current salaries, and the civilian staff of the defence establishment are looking at hikes of 3.7 to 4.5 times.

 The proposals were made to the Sixth Pay Commission today by the chiefs of the armed forces and the defence secretary, a senior defence ministry official said.

 If the proposals are accepted in toto, it would mean an outgo of about Rs 48,000 crore half the current years defence allocations of Rs 96,000 crore. The hikes are being demanded over the salary structure implemented after the Fifth Pay Commission in 1996.

 The armed forces have also asked for an additional military hardship allowance of 50 per cent of enhanced pay for officers and 60 per cent of enhanced pay for personnel below officer rank. 

 But the forces have offered to do away with rank pay starting at Rs 6,000 and going up to around Rs 8,000 given to officers according to rank.

 Trafficking inquiry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 14: Delhi police are likely to seek the help of Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee in questioning three MPs allegedly involved in the immigration racket.

 Faizabad MP Mitrasen Yadav, Sultanpur MP Mohammed Tahir Khan (both BSP) and the BJPs Ramswaroop Koli, MP from Rajasthans Bayana, refused to turn up today despite being issued notices last Friday.

 Ashok Kumar Rawat, another MP named in the racket, which came to light when the BJPs Babubhai Katara was arrested last month while trying to smuggle people abroad on false passports, did, however, show up.

 The presence of the other three MPs is essential for the investigations to proceed. We are likely to write to the Lok Sabha Speaker seeking his intervention, a senior crime branch official said.

 The Speaker, the official added, would be requested to write to the MPs to join the investigation.

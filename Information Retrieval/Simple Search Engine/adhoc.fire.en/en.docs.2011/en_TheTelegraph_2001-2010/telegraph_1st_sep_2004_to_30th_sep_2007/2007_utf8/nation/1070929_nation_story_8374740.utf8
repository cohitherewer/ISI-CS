 Afternoon halt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 28: Evening newspaper Afternoon Dispatch and Courier has stopped printing amid a dispute between CEO Farzana Contractor and board chairman Kamal Morarka.

 The newspaper did not hit the news stands on Thursday and Friday a first in 22 years since it was founded by the late Behram Contractor who wrote the papers popular column Round and About under the pseudonym Busybee.

 Afternoon and Mid Day were Mumbais only English-language eveningers. Afternoon had suffered a decline in circulation after Contractors death in 2001.

 On Wednesday, Contractors wife Farzana wrote a front-page editorial citing a dispute with Morarka as the reason for the problems in publishing the paper.

 She said the paper had published a photograph of hers after she won a local journalism award and captioned it editor. Morarka allegedly asked her to carry a corrigendum saying she was the CEO. When she refused, Morarka threatened that the board would take over the papers operations, the editorial said.

 Media reports quoted Morarka as saying Farzana does not know commerce and we have lost confidence in her. The company is not earning any ad revenue. I have sacked her.

 Neither Farzana nor Morarka was available for comment.

 Rahul gets a rival

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Jayant Singh

 Aligarh, April 11: Uttar Pradesh star campaigner Rahul Gandhi now has a challenger Jayant Singh, Ajit Singhs son.

 Inheritor of the Chaudhary Charan Singh legacy, the London School of Economics alumnus has been fielded to counter the Gandhi scions carpet-bombing campaign in Jat-dominated regions of western Uttar Pradesh.

 Jayant, whose debut on the election trail is viewed by many as yet another political son rise, is hardly new to candidates of Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal, but he had stayed from the hurly-burly of politics so far. Over the past week, however, he has been drawing huge crowds.

 That man (Rahul) doesnt understand what farmers here have to go through. Supporting the Congress is a sure road to disaster, says Jayant in a Sahranpur village.

 In his rallies, he urges people to choose between Rahul Gandhi or the legacy of his grandfather Chaudhary Charan Singh, who dedicated his life to the welfare of farmers. 

 Yesterday, Rahul Gandhi stopped by in Eglas, a constituency about 21 km from Aligarh and where 55 per cent of the voters are Jats. He canvassed for R. Choudhary, the wife of Jat Congress MP Choudhary Vijendra Singh. 

 With support from Mahendra Singh Tikait, the popular farmer leader with a big following in the region, the Congress intends to split Jat votes. The aim is to weaken the position of RLD candidate Bilmesh Singh.

 That doesnt look easy. Not as long as Jayant creates ripples. He brings back the memory of Charan Singh as he tries to emulate his grandfather in all he does. He is western-educated but respects elders. It is as if Chaudhary sahab is back, says farmer Mahitosh Singh.

 Jayant, who specialises in finance, has been overseeing the RLDs youth wing since he arrived from Britain in 2002. He is seen as the leader of the future, much like Rahul Gandhi is. 

 At present, junior Choudhary, as he is called in the party, is in no hurry to take the plunge into politics, but his people skills could well be on test. The RLD, facing a multi-cornered contest in almost every constituency of the region, is going it alone after its efforts to sew up an alliance with Congress didnt work out.

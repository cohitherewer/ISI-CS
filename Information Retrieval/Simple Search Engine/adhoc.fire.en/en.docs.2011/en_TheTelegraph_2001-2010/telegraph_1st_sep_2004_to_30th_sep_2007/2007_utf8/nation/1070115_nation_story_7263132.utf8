 Deer keeps its crown, but cow lands a halo

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Holy animal vs state animal

 Bhopal, Jan. 14: Barasingha or swamp deer will not lose its place as the state animal of Madhya Pradesh to the cow after all. 

 Instead, the cow will be declared a holy animal.

 Animal husbandry minister Ramakant Tiwari said that after toying with the idea of making cow the state animal, the BJP government decided to continue with the swamp deer, an endangered species.

 My ministry has formulated a proposal and soon we will announce the cow as a holy animal, he said.

 Found largely in the Kanha national park, swamp deer is easily recognised by its short coat, light colour, slight build and fine antlers. Down to 66 in 1970, its numbers have risen to over 400 now through careful management. 

 Tiwaris decision to declare the cow as a holy animal comes close on the heels of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhans statement to amend and make more stringent existing laws to check cow slaughter and illegal transportation of the animal.

 Chauhan is planning to rewrite predecessor Uma Bhartis law against cow slaughter and raise the punishment to 14 years in jail. The maximum jail term that can be handed to offenders now is three years.

 The maximum punishment for killing a Barasingha is seven years in jail. 

 At a recent meeting presided over by Chauhan, it was proposed that cow slaughter laws be amended to strengthen the hands of police in checking the activity. The Madhya Pradesh government is also planning to change the law on movement of cows. The existing law, which deals only with vehicular transport of cows, cannot be used if cows are walked in and out of the states borders. Now, a permit will be required from district authorities before cows can be moved.

 Sources said a police officer would be placed in every district to ensure immediate action if the law is broken. The minimum fine will be Rs 5,000 and the maximum could depend on the number of cows slaughtered. The Madhya Pradesh Govansh Vadh Pratishedh Adhiniyam, 2004, provides for a maximum punishment of three years or a fine of Rs 10,000.

 In the other BJP-ruled states of Rajasthan and Gujarat, cow slaughter can invite a maximum jail term of 10 years and seven years respectively.

 The concept of a holy animal is another first by the BJP regime, which has already declared Maheshwar, Maihar, Amarkantak, Orcha, Chitrakoot and parts of Ujjain as holy cities where sale of eggs, fish, meat and liquor is prohibited.

 Madhya Pradesh has over 21 per cent of the countrys forest cover, 11 national parks and 32 wildlife sanctuaries famous for the white tiger, Barasingha, leopard, Sambhar, black buck and the wild buffalo but the cow overshadows them all. The otherwise docile animal has created more than a fair share of controversy in the state.

 During the December 2003 Assembly elections, the Congress had launched a campaign against the then Prime Minister, pointing out that beef exports had gone up during the BJPs rule at the Centre. The slogan Gau hamari mata hai, Atal Bihari gau mans khata hai (Cow is our mother, Atal Bihari eats beef) had Prime Minister Vajpayee up in arms, forcing the Congress to apologise and withdraw the campaign. 

 When Uma Bharti took over as chief minister, she tried to declare the cow as state animal and shared her economic vision saying the states growth would centre around a cow-based economy. Her successor Babulal Gaur announced several concessions for gaushalas (cow shelters). Now it is Chauhans turn to declare it a holy animal.

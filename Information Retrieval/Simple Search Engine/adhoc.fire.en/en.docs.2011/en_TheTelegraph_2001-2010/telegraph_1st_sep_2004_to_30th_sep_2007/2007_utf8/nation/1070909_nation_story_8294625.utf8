 Reprieve for cop on death row

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: The Supreme Court today let a former cop who shot dead three neighbours in a fit of drunken rage escape the hangmans noose.

 It has commuted Desh Rajs sentence to life in jail. 

 The apex court said the accused was not a criminal or an anti-social element and that his actions did not indicate extreme depravity or brutality but drunken rage. 

 Three other members of the victim Chand Singhs family were also injured when an incensed Desh Raj opened fire on them. 

 Both families used to get along and had even attended a bhog ceremony that afternoon. Desh Raj was drunk when he returned home from the ceremony. 

 A few hours later, Desh Rajs wife Jaswant Kaur had a tiff with Singhs wife Manjit Kaur after being accused of dumping rubbish in front of her neighbours house. 

 Desh Raj, gun in hand, rushed out with his two sons and three daughters-in-law. He screamed at Chand Singhs family and fired a shot at Manjit. She died on the spot. He fired another shot at Chand Singhs son, hitting him in the arm. 

 When two of Chand Singhs brothers rushed to help him, Desh Raj reloaded his gun and shot them. One of them died on the spot and the other in hospital. Desh Raj then shot Chand Singh. A few pellets also hit his nephew Tarlok Singh and the child. 

 All through, Desh Rajs family kept telling him not to leave any members of the family alive. All of them later fled the scene.

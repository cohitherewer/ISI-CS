 Apollo doctor suicide

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi. May 29: A doctor who specialised in emergency medicine at the Apollo Indraprastha Hospital died today in an apparent suicide, hospital sources said.

 Umesh Sharma, 40, was found unconscious in his department around 7 am and was declared dead after colleagues failed to revive him.

 He had arrived about an hour earlier, but it is suspected that he had taken something before arriving, an Apollo spokesperson said.

 A single-line suicide note was found on him. The spokesperson said the reason for the suicide is unknown, but added that personal problems are suspected. 

 Doctors who attempted to revive him were unable to determine what exactly he had consumed. A post-mortem will be conducted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences tonight.

 Sharma, a graduate from the Armed Forces Medical College in Pune, had worked with Apollo for eight years, with a break for higher studies abroad.

 He was highly enthusiastic and energetic... but at times did appear to have low spells, said a senior consultant who knew Sharma. But there was nothing specially extraordinary or unusual.

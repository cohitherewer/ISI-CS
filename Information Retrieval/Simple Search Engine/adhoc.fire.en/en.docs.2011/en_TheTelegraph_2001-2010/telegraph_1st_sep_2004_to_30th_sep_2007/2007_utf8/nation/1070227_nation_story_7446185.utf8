 V-day dawns, with prices on mind

 Chandigarh, Feb. 26: If politicians are keeping their fingers crossed, the man on the street is counting the hours.

 For the average voter in Punjab, tomorrows result will bring with it cheap wheat and pulse, whatever the outcome. Both the main rivals the Shiromani Akali Dal and the ruling Congress have promised wheat at Rs 4 a kg and pulse at Rs 20.

 But neither the Dal, which came up with the promise first, nor the Congress has been able to read the pulse of the voter or the 76 per cent turnout, which has never happened in the state. This situation has arisen because voters have cut across barriers like the urban-rural divide and regional affinities, said a senior Congress leader.

 While the Congress is talking of breaking convention by returning to power no party has ruled twice in succession in the state the Dal-BJP alliance is banking on a mandate against the anti-people policies of the Amarinder Singh government. We are looking at a big victory. The people are disillusioned by Amarinders misrule, rising prices and vendetta politics, said alliance leader Daljeet Singh Cheema.

 But contradictory poll surveys have spawned confusion. While an exit poll conducted by Punjab police predicted 75 seats for the Dal-BJP, others indicated a close fight in the 116 Assembly segments where elections where held on February 13.

 For the common man, however, it is all a question of basic necessities. Wheat at Rs 4 a kg means Rs 12 less than what they are paying now. As for pulse, the current price hovers around Rs 60. The government has not been able to contain the price rise in essential commodities. Land rates have virtually touched the sky, said first-time voter Malvika.

 If the government can hand over land almost free for malls, it can provide subsidised food, too, added Shamsher, a government employee.

 Counting will also be held tomorrow for the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat where former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu is pitted against finance minister S. Singla. Sidhu had vacated the seat following his conviction by Punjab and Haryana High Court in a road rage case but has been allowed to contest by the Supreme Court.

 Counting will also be taken up in Uttarakhand, which went to polls on February 21, and in Manipur, where elections were held in three phases.

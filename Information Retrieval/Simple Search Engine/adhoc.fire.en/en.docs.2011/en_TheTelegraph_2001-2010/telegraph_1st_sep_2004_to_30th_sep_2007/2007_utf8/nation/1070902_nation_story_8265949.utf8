 New Delhi, Sept. 1: Designers with studios in Noida had better guard their couture. Thieves here have become fashionable. 

 In the past week, robbers broke into studios of two upcoming designers, Varun Bahl and Varija Bajaj, vanishing with clothes and computers. 

 But the thieves seemed to know their couture from their prt. So, only the expensive clothes have gone missing from both studios. 

 The person is very clever. None of my cotton kurtas has been touched, said Varun, who is days away from the September 5 Wills Lifestyle Fashion Week. The theft last Sunday could not have happened at a worse time. 

 All the heavily embroidered Indian couture has been taken. Each sari cost Rs 2 lakh, he said.

 Varun also lost his stock for a store that he plans to open in Noida. 

 The designer in his twenties, who has made his mark in the last few fashion weeks, took two extra stalls at the event this time. 

 They have tried to demoralise me. What will they do with my computer, with all the pictures of my collections? he asked, trying to piece together a collection hurriedly. 

 The second theft, at Varijas studio, happened on Wednesday. 

 Varija, known for making the sari more versatile, came back to the studio after her Raksha Bandhan break to find that someone had broken in. 

 This thief was either knowledgeable or very smart. The crystals that were stolen, for example, were imported. Whether he took them because they were shinier than the Indian ones or because he knew they were not Indian, I just dont know, Varija said. 

 The thief had a knack for embellishments, so beads and sequins have also vanished from her studio. Her flat-screen computer, a camera and raw stocks were also gone. 

 The two thefts had more in common than just the robbers fetish for expensive clothes. The thieves entered through the windows in both studios.

 Noida police said this could be a first-of-a-kind theft. We are investigating the possibility that these incidents could be the work of one gang. This is the first case of its kind, an officer said. 

 Varun sniffs a personal motive as the break-in happened so close to the fashion week but the police believe the thefts could be for commercial reasons. Maybe, someone who has similar business interests is involved. Both designers have lost their hard disks, said a police officer.

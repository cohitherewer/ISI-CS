 Lalu case reopened

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Patna, Sept. 20: Patna High Court today admitted the Bihar governments appeal against a CBI special court order acquitting Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi in the disproportionate assets case. 

 With this move, the high court has virtually reopened the case against the railway minister and his wife. The couple were cleared by the CBI court on December 18, 2006. 

 Justice R.K. Datta fixed September 24 as the next date of hearing. The appeal relating to the acquittal of Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi is maintainable under Section 378 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the court said. 

 The Bihar government had filed the appeal on February 19 after the CBI decided not to. 

 Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi had contested the state governments appeal arguing that it was not competent to appeal in the disproportionate assets case and other fodder scam cases, which the CBI had investigated. 

 Ram Jethmalani, arguing for the couple, contended that since a central agency had investigated the case and a CBI special court had delivered the verdict, only the agency concerned and the Centre could appeal. 

 Patna High Court had ordered the CBI to probe the Rs 1,000-crore fodder scam in 1996. Lalu Prasad was named one of the main accused in six cases.

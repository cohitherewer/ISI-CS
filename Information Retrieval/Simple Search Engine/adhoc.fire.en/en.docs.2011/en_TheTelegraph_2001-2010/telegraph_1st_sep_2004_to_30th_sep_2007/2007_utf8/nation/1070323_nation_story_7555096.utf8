 Atwal speed estimate

 Arjun Atwal

 Orlando, March 22 (AP): PGA Tour player Arjun Atwal estimated he was going about 130 kph in a 72-kph-zone just before a car speeding next to him flipped and killed its driver, documents from the Florida Highway Patrol show.

 Witnesses have said Atwal and John N. Park, who died, were street racing on March 10 but police have not publicised any evidence to prove the allegation, which the golf player has denied. No criminal charges have been filed, and troopers said today it would be another month before the investigation is complete.

 The highway patrol still hasnt determined independently how fast Atwal and Park were going, but a preliminary report showed the golf pro estimated he was about 55 kph over the limit. Witnesses said the two were going 162 kph.

 Robert Kreusler, CEO of Blue Giraffe, the sports management company representing Atwal, would not comment on the estimated speed. However, Kreusler said: Arjun categorically denies that he was involved in any kind of racing or street racing.

 Both drivers were in expensive, high-performance cars capable of incredible speeds: Atwal in a 2006 BMW M6 with a 500-horsepower engine, and Park in a 2006 Mercedes CLS 55 AMG with a 469-horsepower engine, according to highway patrol documents and vehicle registration information.

 Trooper Kim Miller said there were no signs the cars touched each other. She said Parks car lost control, veering off the road into a fence and a small tree and flipped up to eight times.

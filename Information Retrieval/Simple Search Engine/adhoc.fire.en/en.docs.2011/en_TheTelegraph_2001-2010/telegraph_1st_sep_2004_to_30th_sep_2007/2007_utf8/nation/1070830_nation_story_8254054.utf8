 Rush to clear Advani air

 Advani: No turnaround

 New Delhi, Aug. 29: The twist in the BJPs nuclear plot has a section of the party crying foul.

 Some senior leaders are said to be unhappy at signals emanating from the BJP that L.K. Advani had corrected the wrong line adopted by the party in the beginning. 

 Advani had told a newspaper on Monday that the BJP had no objection to a strategic partnership with the US.

 Sources said the BJP would officially contradict the somersault theory tomorrow or day after. 

 Advani himself expressed surprise at the impression that he had changed the BJP line. He discussed the matter at a meeting this afternoon attended by Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie, the two leaders being projected as the villain of the earlier mistake by some in the party.

 The sources said Advani might issue a statement soon to clear the air. He is expected to underline the objections raised by the party to the deal in its formal disapproval announced by Sinha and Shourie on August 4. These include concerns about Indias sovereignty, storage, reprocessing rights, uninterrupted fuel supply and the Hyde Act. 

 Denying any dilution of stand, the party is expected to iterate its demand for renegotiating the deal.

 But Advanis presumed course correction had delighted a section of the party, who felt the activism of a few leaders (read Sinha and Shourie) had put the BJP in a spot and threatened to alienate the middle class. 

 But the other section thought the party should only highlight that its opposition to the deal was qualitatively different from the Lefts. 

 A senior leader said Advani had created confusion about the BJP-Left axis by calling up CPM general secretary Prakash Karat. Advani was only trying correct his own mistake, not the partys, he added sarcastically.

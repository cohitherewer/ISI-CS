 Dons, Taj pose double threat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Raja Bhaiyya, Amarmani 

 Lucknow, May 12: In her finest hour, two clouds loom on Mayavatis horizon.

 Her absolute majority, the first in Uttar Pradesh in 15 years, could be threatened by the return of the dons who had split her party to topple her government three-and-a-half years ago.

 And she herself is threatened by the signature outgoing chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav put on a piece of office paper yesterday, sanctioning a CBI request to prosecute her in the Rs 175-crore Taj corridor corruption case.

 One of Mayavatis closest advisers, lawyer and Bahujan Samaj Party leader Satish Chandra Mishra, was extremely busy this morning, party sources said.

 He is working out the legal strategy in the Taj case. He is also putting some of our most loyal MLAs on the job of keeping an eye on the others so that the dons cant buy them over, a source said.

 The two dons the BSP fears most are Raja Bhaiyya and Mayavatis former minister Amarmani Tripathi, both of whom she had put behind bars as chief minister, earning applause as a tough administrator. Both had sought revenge by helping engineer the August-September 2003 mega split in Mayavatis party.

 Raja Bhaiyya alias Raghuraj Pratap Singh, a Thakur landlord from Pratapgarh, had been arrested after skeletons were found in a pond at his mansion. Released by Mulayam, he won as an Independent from Kunda this time.

 Amarmani, accused in the murder of poet Madhumita Shukla, contested from jail and won the Lakshmipur seat on a Samajwadi ticket. A Brahmin, he might target the BSPs 51 Brahmin MLAs.

 Although an amended anti-defection law has made splits difficult to achieve, BSP leaders are wary of the intrigue of the dons, whom they refer to as dal tornewalla gut (party-breaking gang).

 Two other musclemen, Mukhtar Ansari and D.P. Yadav, could also pose a threat. Ansari, key accused in the murder of BJP lawmaker Krishnanand Rai in 2005, contested from jail and won as an Independent from Mau. He is close to Mulayam.

 Former BJP MP Yadav, whose son Vikas is the prime accused in the Nitish Katara murder, has won as an Independent from Sahaswan in western Uttar Pradesh. He is believed to be cosying up to Mulayam with the offer of helping him expand his Yadav base.

 If these don-turned-MLAs gang up, we cant ignore them, BSP national spokesman Sudhir Goel said.

 The other threat is more immediate. Samajwadi leaders smell the chance of destabilising Mayavatis government if her prosecution in the Taj corridor case goes ahead.

 Mulayam is believed to have cleared the CBI request, sent on March 11 and followed up with several reminders, just before quitting as chief minister.

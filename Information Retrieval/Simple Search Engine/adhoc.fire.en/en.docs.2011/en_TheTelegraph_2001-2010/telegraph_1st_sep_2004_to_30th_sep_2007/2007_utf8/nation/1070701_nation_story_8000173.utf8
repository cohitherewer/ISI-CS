 Brown faces, in Team B 

 AMIT ROY

 London, June 30: The senior levels of Gordon Browns government are a brown-free zone but Britains new Prime Minister has compensated for the lack of Asian faces in the cabinet by including a number of Indians and Pakistanis in the regimes lower levels. 

 Arun Sarin, 52, Indian-born chief executive officer of Vodafone, is one of several senior figures from finance and industry included on the newly set up Business Council for Britain, which will advise ministers on issues that affect enterprise, business and the long term productivity and competitiveness of the UK economy. 

 One ministerial appointment that will take many by surprise is Browns decision to bring in an Indian-origin woman by the name of Shriti Vadera, 44, who has been a senior adviser to him at the Treasury. She has been dubbed Gordons representative on earth by her critics. 

 It had been widely predicted he would take Vadera with him to 10 Downing Street, but instead she has been appointed parliamentary under secretary of state that is, a junior minister at the Department of International Development. 

 She has allowed so few personal details to be disclosed about herself that the Guardian once described her as half Sri Lankan. 

 The most authoritative piece about her has been written by journalist Martin Vander Weyer, who was briefly her speechwriter in 1998 when she was a director of Warburg Dillon Read (now UBS Investment Bank) in the City. 

 Miss Vadera is Gordon Browns most trusted policy adviser and Whitehall enforcer, he writes in The Spectator magazine. 

 He says: Her bio from City days indicates that she was born in Uganda, that her family moved in the 1970s first to India then to England, and that she studied politics, philosophy and economics at Somerville College, Oxford, before joining Warburgs in 1984. There she absorbed the firms 14-hours-a-day work ethic and its dislike of personalised publicity. 

 Vander Weyer also suggests she does not have much of a love life: So why does this dedicated woman who is also a director of Oxfam and whose private life, Im told, has been sacrificed to her work in the manner of Condi Rice take such a constant kicking? 

 One theory is that its Gordon Browns fault, for giving so much power to a favoured outsider with a vague job-title. Add to that elements of sexism playing the woman not the ball, as one senior official put it and perhaps even racism. What most observers agree upon, however, is that Vadera is the victim of her own lack of political sophistication. 

 However, Sir Nicholas Stern, the former head of the UK Government Economic Service and author of last years report on global warming, described Vaderas appointment yesterday as great news for all those committed to international development. 

 He added: She has had long experience working with NGOs and government, including on the Poverty Reduction Strategies adopted by governments and supported by international financial institutions, on the international financing mechanism for immunisation, on the agreements on aid and debt relief of 2005 and on Education for All. She is creative, committed, experienced and resolute: a splendid appointment. 

 A spokesman for Save the Children said: She has unassailable credentials in development. 

 Todays Independent newspaper says she is tipped as a future governor of the Bank of England, which probably means Vaderas chances are now jinxed. 

 Brown has said he wants to bring in talent from outside the Labour Party and even politics into his government. But there could be a problem in giving power to the unelected. 

 That is not a criticism that could be made about two Pakistani (Shahid Malik and Sadiq Khan) and one Indian origin (Parmjit Dhanda) MPs. 

 Malik member for Dewsbury, a city with a large Muslim population will have equal rank with Vadera in the same ministry, while Dhanda member for Gloucester, an English market town will be parliamentary under secretary of state at the department of communities and local government. 

 Khan, member for Tooting in a Gujarati/Punjabi/Pakistani Muslim part of south London, becomes an assistant government whip in the Commons. 

 The Tories cannot match any of this but will put much effort into the by-election in Ealing Southall, where following the death of sitting Labour MP Piara Singh Khabra the Conservatives have picked Tony Lit, son of flamboyant Sunrise radio boss Avtar Lit as their candidate.

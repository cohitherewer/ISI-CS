 Stick to jolt airlines awake

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 18: Sleep-deprived pilots? Technical snags? Sorry, airlines, that wont do.

 If you ground passengers for long, be ready to pay up.

 The government today said it would soon come out with new guidelines to compensate travellers for delays and cancellation of flights and make airlines more accountable.

 We will formulate fresh guidelines for passenger-related issues like delays and cancellations which cause harassment to passengers, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said.

 The promise of strict action came after reporters quizzed him on technical snags that have delayed several Air-India flights recently and the 13-hour wait British Airways passengers had to endure earlier this week when the pilot complained he hadnt had enough sleep.

 The minister said his understanding was that the government had enough ways to make the airlines accountable or penalise them and compensate passengers.

 Patel said his ministry would study the rules of the International Air Transport Association, which govern the sector as well as relevant domestic and international laws. 

 Responding to questions on Jets takeover of Air Sahara, Patel said there would be no problem in transferring assets like parking slots, bays and airport counters to the new owner.

 If they (Air Sahara) have aircraft, parking slots or landing slots or schedules, there are no issues. The policy is already in place and these can go to the next owner, he told reporters.

 The government had last year cleared a policy on mergers and acquisitions in the sector.

 Patel said Jet Airways had not yet approached his ministry on these issues and added that the airline would need to get fresh approvals only if it changed its board of directors.

 But there are no problems relating to transfer of ownership, he said, adding that these issues were settled months ago when the Jet-Sahara deal was in the process of getting finalised, but later fell through.

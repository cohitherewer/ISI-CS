 Girls can go to boys school: HC

 Allahabad, Aug. 7 (PTI): Allahabad High Court today said restrictions on admitting girls in boys schools were an outdated practice and arbitrary and violative of Articles 14 and 15 (fundamental rights).

 Girl students should be given the choice to pick their subjects and pursue their studies in the best institutions, Justice Sunil Ambawani said.

 The management committee of a girls school in Jalaun district had sought a directive to restrain boys schools from offering admission to girls. 

 An Uttar Pradesh government order amending the intermediate education act allows such admissions only in case of a girls school being locally unavailable or the institution not offering subjects of her choice, the committee claimed. 

 Dismissing the petition, the court said the state cannot put unreasonable restrictions on the choice of school on the ground of sex or to favour an unaided educational institution for girls.

 The high court added it would not enforce the government orders which are violative of the fundamental rigths enshrined in the Constitution of India.

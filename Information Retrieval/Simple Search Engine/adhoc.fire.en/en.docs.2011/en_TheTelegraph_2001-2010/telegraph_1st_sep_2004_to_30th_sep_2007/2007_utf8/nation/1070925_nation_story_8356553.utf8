 New York, Sept. 24: This was not the way it was meant to be. There was not even a whisper about the Indo-US nuclear deal at the glittering inauguration here yesterday of India60, a multifaceted four-day extravaganza to celebrate the countrys achievements in the western hemisphere.

 External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, the lead Congress negotiator with the Left on the nuclear deal, spoke about Indias relations with the US in his inaugural address, but he spoke only about expanding trade with America.

 A few months ago, it would have been inconceivable that any event let alone a high-profile one such as India60 that brought together Indians and Americans could take place without major references in praise of the nuclear deal.

 It was not the Indians alone who were shying away from talking about the deal yesterday at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, part of a sprawling 16-acre, 12-organisation complex in New York that is at the heart of this citys intellectual and artistic life.

 New Yorks senior senator, Charles Schumer, a kingmaker in American politics who led the Democratic Partys successful campaign last November to regain control of the US Senate, also did not mention the nuclear deal even in passing in his speech.

 With a costly US presidential and congressional election due next year, Schumer used the occasion to praise Indian-Americans who have been generously contributing to the election funds of the Democratic Party. 

 Neither did finance minister P. Chidambaram nor commerce minister Kamal Nath refer to the nuclear deal at a dinner for some of New Yorks most influential people at this citys renowned Public Library.

 Henry Kissinger, the minence grise of the American diplomatic establishment, made an embarrassed reference to declassified US state department documents in 1971, in which he had called Indira Gandhi a bitch.

 Kissinger, who has already apologised for this and other similar unflattering references to the then Prime Minister, said he was now a convert to Indias cause.

 A convert is more passionate than a believer, he told the dinner audience last night.

 The nuclear deal did, however, come up at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas or Day of Overseas Indians, at which Indian-Americans and Caribbean-Indians discussed their concerns and problems.

 Several Indian-Americans expressed concern that the two-year effort they had put in to rally political support in the US for legislation enabling the implementation of the deal would be wasted.

 Vayalar Ravi, the minister for overseas Indian affairs, responding to those concerns, was non-committal about the future of the deal, not going beyond broad, general support for it.

 He chose a safer option of praising Indias traditional links with the Caribbean, where he recently visited Indian communities, long neglected by New Delhi.

 Ravi was also called upon to defend the UPA governments stand on the Ram affidavit, which he did by insisting that he personally was a believer in Ram.

 Ronen Sen, Indias ambassador to the US and a strong defender of the nuclear deal, made only a cryptic reference to it in his address at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.

 No other issue has ever enthused and united the vibrant Indian-American community as the proposed agreement on civil nuclear cooperation, Sen said.

 Unlike those in the government, corporate leaders attending India60 have been quite vocal about the deal, especially in conversations with the media about the business opportunities it offered.

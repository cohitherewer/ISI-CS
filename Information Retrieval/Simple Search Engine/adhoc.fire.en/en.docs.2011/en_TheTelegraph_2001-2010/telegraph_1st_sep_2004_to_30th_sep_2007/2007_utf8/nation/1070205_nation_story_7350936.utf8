 Elections bring NRIs home

 - Moneybags in Punjab to campaign

 Chandigarh, Feb. 4: Some are dressed in jeans and designer shoes. Others sport wristwatches that cost more than an average Indians yearly income. And almost all are drenched in cologne.

 From the biggest petrol retailer in the US to realty agents and even taxi drivers, non-resident Punjabis are thronging their home state like never before.

 They are back not just to meet their relatives. They want to make their presence felt with dollars when the state goes to polls on February 13.

 Petrol king of the US Darshan Singh Dhaliwal is one of them. Although I have not had any interest in electoral politics, I have no choice but to be here to help my younger brother Surjit Singh Rakhra, who is contesting on a Shiromani Akali Dal ticket from Samana, says Dhaliwal, who has arrived in India with bags full of dollars.

 Darshan, who left for America in 1972 and is believed to be close to President George W. Bush, is putting his business expertise to good use for his brother. 

 Like doing business in the US, we plan everything before making the next move. But I must add that this time, I have one eye set on lowering crude oil prices, he says with a wink.

 Many non-resident Punjabis have even been addressing rallies and roadside meetings. NRIs play an important role in all elections in Punjab, from panchayat to Parliament, says Harjeet Singh from Gloucester, UK.

 Harjeet is here to help former Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee chief Jagir Kaur, who is contesting from Bholath. It does not matter to him that Kaur has declared assets worth over Rs 80 crore while filing her nomination.

 She had helped NRIs when she was in power. And this is one way for our generation of Punjabis to identify with our motherland, he says.

 In return for their money muscle, the NRIs hope to win contracts for projects, clinch land deals and even settle disputes. As Harjeet says: It is a give-and-take relationship.

 An NRI force of over 3,000 has hit the road from Canada alone. On election day, sources say, there could be 50,000 of them spread across the state.

 Its not all politics, though, for the NRI brigade. Some are here to scout for youths willing to go abroad. I can pay them less than one-third of what I have to pay if I employ an American, says one NRI who did not want to be named.

 They will not squeak even after knowing that I am cheating them. With more and more people yearning to go abroad from Punjab, elections are the best time to scout for workers.

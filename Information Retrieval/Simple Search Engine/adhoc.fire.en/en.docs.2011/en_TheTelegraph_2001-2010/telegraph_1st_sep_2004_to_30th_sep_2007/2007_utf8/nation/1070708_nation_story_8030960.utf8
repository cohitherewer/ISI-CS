 BJP digs up Sonia roots in fight for President

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sonia, Shekhawat 

 New Delhi, July 7: The BJP today resurrected Sonia Gandhis foreign origin to try and counter the Congresss charge that Bhairon Singh Shekhawat had served British police during the colonial rule and quit only when they left India.

 Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi had said: When people left behind everything to join the freedom struggle, responding to Mahatma Gandhis call, Shekhawat thought it fit to be part of the repressive colonial police. 

 Shekhawats election minder, Sushma Swaraj, today responded: It doesnt lie in the Congresss mouth to speak of the freedom movement after accepting a foreigner as the party president.

 Asked why she persisted in calling Sonia a foreigner, despite the Congress president winning successive Lok Sabha elections and leading her party to victory several times, Sushma told reporters: I have always said shes a foreigner. After July 19 (when the new President will be elected), I am open to a debate on this issue. 

 However, she denied levelling a personal charge. This is not personal, it is 100 per cent political.

 Sushma maintained that it was erroneous to say that Shekhawat had served British police when the country was swayed by the Quit India movement. She clarified that he was part of the police contingent maintained by one of Rajasthans erstwhile royal principalities. 

 But when asked who had signed and commended Shekhawat when he left in 1952 to join politics, she conceded it was a senior police officer called Tripathi who worked under the British. She insisted, though, that Tripathi had not used force against the Quit India activists.

 Shekhawats bio-data on the Rajya Sabha website is silent on his police background but says he is not a freedom fighter in the relevant column.

 Sushma, however, did not say when Shekhawat, the NDAs Independent candidate in the presidential election, would declare his assets, now that the Election Commission has said it has no jurisdiction in this regard. 

 It is not a legal requirement, but because the issue involves probity in public life, Shekhawat will declare his assets as soon as the papers are ready, she said, adding that he would put the details on his personal website so that it is in the public domain.

 BJP leaders have been asking the Vice-President to declare his assets at the earliest, but Shekhawat has been dragging his feet. His chartered accountant, based in Jaipur, is supposed to be in Delhi tomorrow to finalise the papers so that he can declare them either on Monday or Tuesday.

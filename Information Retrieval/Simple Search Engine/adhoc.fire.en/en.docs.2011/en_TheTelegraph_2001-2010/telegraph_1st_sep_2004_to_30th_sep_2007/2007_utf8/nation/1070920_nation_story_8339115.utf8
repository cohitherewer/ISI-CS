 Centre nukes proposal for private plants

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The 

 atomic energy department has dropped plans to allow privately 

 controlled nuclear power plants in the backdrop of a tug 

 of war over the 123 Agreement between the government and 

 the Left. 

 In a note on a set of amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1962, the department has said the provision to enable private participation has been omitted.

 Among the cleared amendments is one that empowers the government to take over custody as well as ownership of spent fuel in case organisations dealing with it are unable to take steps for its safe management in a manner satisfactory to the Centre. 

 While this does not negate the clauses related to right to return of fissile material which allows the US to cart away nuclear material given by it to India, it does give the Indian government the right to take control over all spent fuel if it so wishes.

 Under the 123 Agreement, imported nuclear spent fuel is expected to be reprocessed in a new dedicated reprocessing facility which India has offered to set up. Although this is supposed to be under international supervision, the amendment suggests that the government can if at some stage it feels it is necessary take control and ownership.

 These amendments may well prove to be music to the ears of the Left, which has not favoured the 123 Agreement with the US and the possible opening up of Indias nuclear power sector. 

 However, the clamp on privately controlled nuclear power would mean that elaborate plans drawn up by Indias major business houses, including the Tatas, Reliance Energy and GMR, to enter what they saw as a Rs 100,000-crore sector, will have to be halted for the time being. 

 The Planning Commission had advocated allowing foreign direct investment in nuclear power plants. Several multinationals, including Westinghouse and Electricite de France, were believed to be interested in picking up shares in private plants when they came up. 

 However, the Centre has now chosen to retain firm control over nuclear power generation. But the amendments do provide for nuclear power generation agencies and corporations established by the government. 

 This means state-run corporations like NTPC could get the go-ahead. Currently, nuclear power generation is the monopoly of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India. 

 The amendments exempt from the purview of the regulatory authority all nuclear plants and establishments earmarked by the government as strategic. This is seen as an attempt to facilitate separate civilian and military nuclear establishments.

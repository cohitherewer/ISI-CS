 Kalam hint at life after term

 New Delhi, Feb. 25 (PTI): With about four months left in his tenure, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has indicated that he is not interested in another term.

 In remarks that are bound to influence the permutations and combinations of various parties for the July presidential polls, Kalam said at a programme at the Madras Institute of Technology: I will return here in three months time to give a series of four to five lectures on nanotechnology and its many dimensions.

 I would particularly like to teach undergraduate students.

 An NDA delegation had told Kalam a few months ago that the Opposition combine would be with him if he wanted to run for a second term. 

 The dignity of the office of President has been enhanced by Kalam. We have told him that if he wants to run for another term, we are with him, BJP chief Rajnath Singh had said after he met Kalam with L.K. Advani and George Fernandes.

 Poison protest

 Six jobless youths consumed poison to draw Kalams attention to their plight at an event attended by him in Karnataka.

 The youths, who had completed an industrial training course, shouted slogans seeking jobs when Kalam was seated on the dais. Police took the youths to hospital. The six are said to be out of danger.

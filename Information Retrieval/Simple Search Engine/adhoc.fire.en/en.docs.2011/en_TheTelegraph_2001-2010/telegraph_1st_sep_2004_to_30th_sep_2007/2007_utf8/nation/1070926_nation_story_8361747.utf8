 A Bollywood saga ends, Priyanka at peace

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Priyanka: Alls well that ends well

 Bhopal, Sept. 25: Priyanka Chopra and her former secretary have called a truce.

 A spokesperson for the actress said: All pending issues with regard to Prakash Jaju have been settled amicably between both parties. This has resulted in all legal proceedings between both parties to be withdrawn in the respective courts.

 Peace was brokered in Mumbai yesterday by producer Sajid Nadiadwala, who is a friend of the actress.

 Jaju, who had accused Priyanka of holding back Rs 1 crore she owed him as service fee, today blamed a chartered accountant for the rift. He said differences cropped up between us because of a chartered accountant but now all outstanding issues have been settled amicably. 

 He had also accused the actress of employing Chhota Shakeel to threaten him. Madhya Pradesh High Court acquitted Priyanka of the charge.

 Jaju said he opted for an out-of-court settlement as Priyankas father is suffering from cancer, but did not disclose the amount he received after the settlement.

 He will withdraw all cases against the actress and her father, who has a non-bailable warrant pending against him.

 We have amicably settled the dispute in the presence of noted filmmaker Sajid Nadiadwala, Jaju said. Three other leading producers also played peacemaker.

 Priyanka, who starred in Sajids blockbuster Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, too, said she had settled her differences with Jaju. 

 Jajus association with Priyanka goes back to 2000 when she was crowned Miss World. 

 Jaju, a small-time finance broker and film distributor, came in contact with Priyanka through a private agency. He started working with her in 2001. But within a few months, differences arose between them and Jajus contract came to an end on May 6 the same year. 

 Priyanka also hit a lean patch after that amid rumours of a romance with a leading actor.

 In June 2002, Jaju again became Priyankas secretary. Sources close to the actress said Jaju, in his second stint, began taking personal interest in her. Priyanka also alleged that she had received unwanted, romantic text messages from Jaju. On one occasion, Jaju allegedly barged into Priyankas room drunk. 

 In July 2004, he resigned as her secretary but insisted on getting a commission. He accused Priyanka of violating the service contract.

 Priyanka and her father were not the only ones to have complained against Jaju. Director-producer Rakesh Roshan filed a police complaint, accusing Jaju of alleged extortion and intimidation. 

 Jaju had briefly served as secretary to actress Celina Jaitley, but she, too, parted ways with him and issued an advertisement distancing herself from him.

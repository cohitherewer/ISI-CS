The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Ramp to FI, Priyanka goes global

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Calcutta, April 5: First Shilpa Shetty. Now Priyanka Chopra. 

 No, the former Miss World is not at the receiving end of any racial abuse, but her flagging off the Malaysian Grand Prix at Sepang tomorrow is recognition enough of the crossover appeal of the Krrish star.

 Why? Because Priyanka (in picture) will be kick-starting the second Grand Prix of the year alongside the likes of Steven Spielberg and Leonardo DiCaprio. Yes, the Hollywood biggies are expected to flag off the F1 race that will take place over the weekend and culminate with the final two-hour race on Sunday.

 It all happened a week back when Priyanka was in Malaysia performing at the Zee Cine Awards at Genting. The Prime Minister of Malaysia extended his invitation to be a part of the flag-off; I feel very humbled, says the actress, who has made a successful transition from the ramp to the reel. 

 Also, the fact that Priyanka was the leading lady in last years Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Don, which was shot mostly in Malaysia and had a tie-up with Malaysian Tourism, must have swung things in her favour.

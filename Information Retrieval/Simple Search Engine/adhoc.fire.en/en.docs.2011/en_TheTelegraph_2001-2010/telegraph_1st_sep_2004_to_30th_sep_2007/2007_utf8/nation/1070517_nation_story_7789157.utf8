 Missing companion held

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 16: Naval authorities in Goa have detained Manish Thakur, who had been missing since murdered software engineer Koushambi Layeks body was found in a city hotel on Monday.

 We have sent a team to Goa and based on the information provided by us, the navy has detained Manish. He will be brought to the city by tomorrow, said additional commissioner of police (west) Bipin Bihari.

 The police say Koushambi was killed because she wanted Manish to divorce his wife and marry her. We have found out that Manish wanted to marry Koushambi as well. But when she began blackmailing him, he must have taken the drastic step, Bihari said.

 Police sources said Koushambis family knew of their affair and disapproved of it. Koushambi is said to have met Manish two years ago in Kerala, where her company had sent her for training.

 Sources in Kochi, where Manish is based, confirmed that he tied the knot four years ago and his wife lives in Calcutta with his parents.

 Officers probing the case said Manish could have planned the murder in advance and used his service revolver to shoot her. 

 They suspect that Manish, a junior commissioned officer, boarded a bus for Goa at 4 am soon after committing the crime but, in his haste, left behind his bags, shoes, a naval uniform and badge.

 The investigations have revealed that the two had earlier checked into various hotels as husband and wife. The police said Koushambi, whose father expired recently, was her familys sole breadwinner. Her younger brother is suffering from blood cancer.

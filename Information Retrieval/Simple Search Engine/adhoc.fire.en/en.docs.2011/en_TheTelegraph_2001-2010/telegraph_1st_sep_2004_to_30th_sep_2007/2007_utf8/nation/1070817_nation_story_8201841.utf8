 Farmers take risk but land in debt trap

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY 

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: Nearly half of Indias farmers are in debt the upshot of switching to high-yielding but high-risk crops.

 The large number 48.6 per cent of debtors suggests that rising aspirations are spurring farmers to take risks but they are not getting institutional support.

 The data also show that farmers are still at the mercy of the local moneylender, underscoring how political forces that swear by agriculture and oppose industrialisation are paying little other than lip service to their avowed cause.

 Around 2,000 farmers have committed suicide since 1996, most of them after running up high debts. A Rs 25,000-crore farm investment package that included interest subsidies on loans has not helped much. 

 A government study has shown that Andhra Pradesh, where farmers tried to switch from traditional grain to high-yielding cotton, tops the list with 82 per cent farmers in debt. In some 10 others, including Bengal, around or more than 50 per cent are in debt.

 Former Planning Commission member S.P. Gupta explained that farmers are increasingly trying to get onto the cash crop bandwagon or are experimenting with high-yield seeds that require more fertilisers, more water, more pesticide and more of everything which is costly. When profit turns to loss because of higher costs and higher risks, things get messy. 

 Farmers who moved to cotton or oilseeds when prices increased suffered when unfamiliar pests, which come with new seeds, devoured the crops or when prices suddenly crashed. 

 Many went bankrupt after switching from traditional rice or wheat seeds to a high-yielding variety. 

 There has hardly been any debt relief for these farmers. They cant declare themselves insolvent nor can they get bailout packages of the sort prepared for plantation crops or businesses, an official associated with the study said. 

 High interest rates charged by moneylenders also compound the misery of farmers. While marginal farmers tend to borrow nearly two-thirds of their loan from moneylenders, bigger farmers borrow from banks but at the same time go to moneylenders for at least a third of the loan. 

 The study shows that moneylenders continue to be an important source of loans to farmers, especially marginal farmers. Unless policy steps are taken to protect farmers from their usurious practices, we could see more suicides, Gupta said. He said an anti-usury law was needed. 

 According to the study, the average outstanding loan among farmers is Rs 25,895 for a family. It is the lowest among sub-marginal farmers, at Rs 14,866 a family, and highest among large farmers at Rs 51,726. 

 In Bengal, the average outstanding debt for a farmer family was Rs 10,500. For Andhra, it was Rs 29,000. However, in states like Kerala, Punjab and Haryana, it was around or above Rs 50,000.

 Another disconcerting piece of statistic is the slow growth in the farm sector. While the manufacturing sector grew at over 12 per cent in 2006-07, the farm sector grew by just 2.7 per cent.

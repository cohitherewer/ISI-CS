 Calcutta, July 4: Rahul Mahajan has resurfaced this time as an aspiring film producer and actor.

 Son of the late BJP leader Pramod Mahajan, Rahul stole the spotlight from the leading ladies of Tollywood as the surprise guest of the evening during the premiere of Anuranan in Calcutta on Wednesday.

 Moon Moon Sen, Aparna Sen, Rituparna Sengupta and Raima Sen were all there at INOX (City Centre) for the special screening of Aniruddha Roy Chowdhurys film. But once Rahul emerged from the darkness of the theatre, he hogged all the attention.

 Tony (Aniruddha) is a very good friend of mine and Im here to support him, said Rahul, dressed in a white shirt and blue denims. I also know Rituparna, Raima, Rahul (Bose) and Rajat (Kapoor) the four principal players in the Bengali film very well. We are all good friends, he said.

 Prodded about his future in the film world , the 27-year-old revealed: I want to produce a Hindi film soon, but I cant divulge much. The title and the star cast are yet to be finalised. Im going to decide everything with Tony.

 What about acting? Well, Im ready to act but not in my own production, he said.

 Does that put an end to speculation about his role in politics? I am not interested in politics at all. And I dont want to get involved in politics at this stage of my life. There are matters pending in court and things on the personal front are not too good either, he said, probably referring to his rocky marriage.

 Moreover, it is difficult to make a career in films from politics, but easy to jump into politics from films, Rahul added.

 The state BJP leadership was completely in the dark about Mahajan juniors Calcutta trip. We are not aware of his visit.... Yes, he is a primary member of the party, but we have lakhs of such members in the country, shrugged a party spokesperson.

 Mumbai, April 15: A 16-year-old girl was raped at Tata Memorial Cancer Hospital while she was under sedation for a surgery in October last year, her parents have alleged.

 Her father filed a complaint at Bhoiwada police station in central Mumbais Parel last night after the girl was found to be pregnant on April 7. Two ward boys are suspects.

 Ruksana Khan (not her real name), who had cancer in the spine, was admitted to the female ward on October 4. 

 She was discharged two months after her surgery on November 18, but continued to visit the hospital for check-ups. During one such scan on April 7, the doctor found her pregnant.

 In the complaint, Ruksana has said she suspected she was raped when she lay semi-conscious in the operation theatre. Before the sedation, the Goregaon resident said she heard two ward boys passing obscene remarks about her. 

 We want home minister R.R. Patil to look into the case. How can someone do this to a cancer patient? We want the culprits to be punished immediately, Ruksanas father said. 

 The Shiv Sena, Republic Party of India, the Bajrang Dal and some womens groups staged demonstrations at the hospital this afternoon, demanding action from the minister.

 The charges left the hospital stunned. We are confident our staff cant indulge in this kind of behaviour with patients. However, we are treating this issue with the sensitivity it deserves and will provide all possible co-operation to the police, hospital spokesperson S. Jafri told The Telegraph.

 However, the case took a curious turn around six this evening. The police received a report from JJ Hospital saying the girl is now 27 weeks and a few days pregnant. 

 This indicates she might have already been carrying before she was operated on. Deputy commissioner D. Karale said it would be premature to comment. We have got leads and we will complete the investigations soon.

 Mumbai, July 18: As a tiny body was pulled out from under the debris, a young woman slumped to the ground.

 The eight-month-old didnt have a chance the concrete rain just buried her.

 She wasnt the only one to go under piles of broken walls when a part of a seven-storey building in suburban Mumbai came crashing down around six this evening.

 Witnesses said 12 families went down with a portion of the 23-year-old Lakshmi Chhaya in Borivli along with the owners and employees of shops on the ground floor. Over 100 people are feared trapped underneath the rubble.

 Residents blamed the owner of a jewellery shop for the collapse. He was doing some renovations. We had told him time and again to be careful, but to no avail. He hit the main pillar of the wing. This has led to the collapse, said a resident.

 At least 24 fire engines and paramedical personnel have reached the spot for rescue efforts. Police said 10 persons have died so far but the toll could rise.

 An eyewitness said it took just a couple of seconds for the entire wing to collapse. Others said about a dozen people have been rescued, including a child, but work was being hampered because of receding light and a massive crowd that had gathered from surrounding areas.

 There is a power outage in the building and people are trying to get generators. There are people screaming for help, said Devesh, an eyewitness. 

 West Borivli councillor Mohan Mithbawkar said the middle portion of the building, which has three wings, came down like a pack of cards. Prima facie it seems to me that the building was not in good shape. Repair work had also been reportedly going on which could have played a role in the collapse.

 Sunita, a resident of the building who was not inside at the time of the collapse, said she was surprised that there had been no warning signs.

 Doctors at the nearby Bhagwati hospital, where the injured are being taken, said most of them have head and chest injuries.

 About five are critically injured, said Dr Charanya, who was attending to the injured.

 Maharashtra deputy chief minister R.R. Patil, who visited the spot, has ordered a probe into the collapse and also questioned why the building did not figure on the list of endangered buildings in the city.

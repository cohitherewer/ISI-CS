The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Pilgrims progress, unaware of plot

 NISHIT DHOLABHAI

 New Delhi, July 30: Little do the pilgrims who prayed on the Gangas banks in Hardwar today know how close to tragedy some of them may have come this morning.

 The Delhi-Hardwar passenger train that brought bands of devotees to the holy town on the first Monday of Shravan would have been blown up by a militant group had the plot not been busted last month.

 The Harkat-ul Jehadi Islami Bangladesh, working closely with the Calcutta underworld, was to target the train today, an arrested militant has revealed.

 According to Uttar Pradesh polices special task force, which uncovered the plot, at least three militants carrying two explosive devices would have boarded the train at Meerut. They would then have planted the bombs.

 The revelations come from Babubhai alias Jalaluddin, a Harkat commander arrested in Lucknow in June. The resident of South 24-Parganas was picked up with three accomplices, Naushad, Yakub and Naser. 

 The special task force found 16kg RDX, AK-47s, grenades and detonators at Yakubs house in Bijnaur and at another location. Around the same time, Bengal police picked up three militants belonging to the same network.

 We dont know how many cells like this are operating in the country. We found success after two years of hard work, a home ministry official said.

 This would have been the Harkats second major operation in north India after the Varanasi blasts on March 7 last year.

 It was during a meeting to finalise the assemblage of the explosive devices in Uttar Pradesh that Babubhai was nabbed.

 The man was once associated with Asif Raza Khan, involved in the 2001 kidnapping of Khadim boss Partha Pratim Roy Burman in Calcutta. Khan, a key figure in Calcuttas underworld, was also in touch with the Jaish-e-Mohammed and other militant groups based in Pakistan. 

 Babubhai worked out a mutually beneficial relationship between the underworld and the militant groups, who began using each others networks.

 Khan was killed in an encounter in Gujarat in 2002. His brother Amir Raza Khan, who was also based in Calcutta at one time, is now a Harkat kingpin in Pakistan.

 Amir had worked out the entire operation of sneaking in explosives from Bangladesh, through Bengal, into Uttar Pradesh. Babubhai was his point man.

 Babubhai has confessed during questioning that he was trained in camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, which is also a launch pad for militants from Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand and Malaysia.

 Sis-in-law out, MPs wife in

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Jan. 28: Jalandhars Congress MP Rana Gurjit Singh, a relative of Noida serial murders accused Moninder Singh Pandher, has got his sister-in-law Sukhjinder Kaur to make way for his wife Rajbans Kaur to contest from Kapurthala.

 Senior Congress leaders believe Gurjit deliberately messed up the nomination papers of Sukhjinder, the partys official candidate. Rajbans was the covering candidate.

 Earlier, state party chief Shamsher Singh Dullo had elbowed out his wife Harbans after both of them had applied for the party ticket from the Khanna Assembly seat. 

 The party has declared that only one ticket would be given to one family.

 Sukhjinder had filed only one set of incomplete nomination papers for the February 12 Assembly polls in the state while Rajbans submitted three copies.

 Sukhjinders application was rejected by the returning officer for her failure to deposit the security fee of Rs 5,000 and to furnish details of her age. 

 She had also made a mistake while filling in the blank for the number of voters who had proposed her name. Both Sukhjinders and Rajbanss papers were attested by the same notary public. 

 Some senior Congress leaders alleged that the details were deliberately not furnished to pave the way for Gurjits wife to enter the fray. 

 He could have asked for a ticket for his wife when they were being distributed. But he chose not to. He has gone against the Congress high commands decision. This is not the way to ensure tickets for the family, a party general secretary said, adding that Dullo was furious with Gurjit.

 While Sukhjinder was not available for comment, Gurjit termed the rejection of his sister-in-laws papers unfortunate. He added, It is up to me to decide who should contest the seat from the family. It is a family matter.

 Family sources said Gurjit, an industrialist, had been pressuring Sukhjinder to vacate the seat in favour of his son Inder, who is a US citizen. 

 When it became clear that Inder could not contest the polls as he had not stayed in India continuously for the mandatory period, Gurjit told her she had become an MLA only because of him and it was time for her to repay the debt so that the seat remained with his family.

 Sukhjinder did not want any enmity within the family. She made no effort to rectify the discrepancies in her papers despite a notice from returning officer Karnail Singh. She did not want the differences to come out in the open, an aide said.

 Dullo said he had informed the party high command about the development. You cannot cheat the party like this, he fumed. It is a conspiracy against the high commands decision.

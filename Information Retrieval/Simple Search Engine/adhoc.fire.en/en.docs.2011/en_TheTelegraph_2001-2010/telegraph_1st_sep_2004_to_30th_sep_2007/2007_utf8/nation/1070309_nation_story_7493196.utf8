 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Runaway patients stump doctors

 Doctors at Nair Hospital, among the citys biggest, are struggling to treat an odd malady: runaway patients.

 The hospital has a dubious record of patients fleeing, the last one being Shivaji Aswale, from a Nashik village. The 22-year-old vanished from the plastic surgery ward. Usually, such patients end up at home and have to be brought back. Doctors speak of four to five cases each day. 

 This is nothing new. Sometimes, we have as many as 12 patients vanishing. We inform police and register a case, says Dr Mahesh Shah, the hospitals deputy dean.

 So, are patients running scared of bills? Apparently not, because treatment is subsidised at the government hospital. Poor patients who cant pay even the nominal fee often get help from several generous local social workers.

 Shah puts it down to homesickness. He might be correct, and this is one diagnosis where he better not be wrong.

 Future dim, present tense

 Hed long been foretelling the stars, but hed little idea of the black holes that jilted clients on earth could dig for him.

 A judicial magistrate summoned Sivasamy, a Naadi Jothidam astrologer in the temple town of Vaitheeswaran, for predicting the long life of a man whod died four years ago. The astrologer is fighting cheating charges.

 Naadi Jothidam is a branch of astrology based on ancient palm-leaf manuscripts, from which predictions are read after matching the thumb impressions of a person.

 A customer who had felt cheated by some of Sivasamys prognosis decided to teach him a lesson. He gave him the thumb impressions of a dead man, taken from an old document, and wanted the predictions to be given in writing. The fee was fixed at Rs 2,000. 

 An unsuspecting Sivasamy pulled out the manuscript and wrote down his findings. Gopalakrishnan, the client most astrologers would dread, has argued Sivasamy is guilty of cheating under the Indian Penal Code.

 Rewards peel off

 Digest this. An Indian processed food exporter (Himalya International) informed the Bombay Stock Exchange on Wednesday that it has received a $7-million order from a North American company to supply, guess what, mini potato skins. 

 The skins would be sent in food service packs and marketed through food service giants like Sysco. Apparently, potato skin hors doeuvres are the latest rage in American restaurants. They are baked, stir-fried or deep fried, then wrapped in dressings or topped with cheese, bacon or anything you might fancy. They have also emerged as a popular party fare. 

 Who thought the cranky great-aunt who could cook a mean meal of the modest veg peels was actually serving what many consider a gourmet dish!

 Laugh again

 Having brought the house down with his witticism in Bangalore, Russell Peters had Delhi in splits. No one was spared Gujaratis, Punjabis, Tamilians and George W. Bush as he performed at the Sri Sathya Sai Baba auditorium last week. Switching between his normal North American-accented English to Punjabi-style abuse and Gujarati business talk with ease, the Canada-based stand-up comedian was doing a Laughter Challenge. 

 ome samples: I dont know whos the Prime Minister of India. Isnt it Rajiv Gandhi? he enquires, a naughty twinkle in his eyes. Whos going to be the butt of his jokes in India? Pat comes the reply: Pooja Bhatt. Organisers are believed to be planning a second show.

 Mumbai: Film buffs have a treat lined up at the ninth Mumbai Academy of Moving Images Film Festival. The week-long festival was inaugurated at the Y.B. Chavan Centre on Wednesday evening. The screenings will also take place at IMAX Adlabs plexes and at Fun Republic in Andheri.

 Another shot at Ottavio

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 20: The CBI has filed an application in the Argentine Supreme Court against a lower court order rejecting its plea to extradite Ottavio Quattrocchi.

 Under Argentine law, the lower court verdict is placed automatically in the Supreme Court unless it is withdrawn.

 CBI officials said the apex court would list the matter if the withdrawal appeal was not made by tomorrow the end of the five-working-day period given to move the application.

 The decision to withdraw the appeal would have to be taken by legal officers in Delhi. But till late tonight, the CBI was clueless if the government had taken any decision. 

 This is the last hope for the CBI to get the Bofors accused extradited. 

 Quattrocchi, who has won every case against him, may just be a step away from freedom. 

 The Italian businessman was arrested in February on the basis of an Interpol red-corner notice. 

 He will be able to leave Argentina if the Supreme Court upholds the lower courts order. 

 For the CBI, an adverse order can permanently seal the fate of the Bofors case as it will be difficult to bring home the only remaining accused to face trial. 

 The going will be tough for the agency as it will not be allowed to re-argue the case in the apex court.

 The Supreme Court will only go through the records of lower court. On the basis of this, it will decide if the judgment was correct. 

 If the ruling is in Quattrocchis favour, he could use it to get the Interpol red-corner notice quashed, the CBI officials said. Then the CBI will have to get a fresh non-bailable warrant against him to sustain the Interpol notice.

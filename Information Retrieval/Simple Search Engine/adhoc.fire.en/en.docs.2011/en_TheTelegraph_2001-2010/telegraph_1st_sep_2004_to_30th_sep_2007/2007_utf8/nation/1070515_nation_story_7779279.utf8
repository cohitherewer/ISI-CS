 Cops sniff clue in Vanzara phone chat

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 14: Gujarat police investigators today said they had clinching evidence against deputy inspector-general D.G. Vanzara and the other officers arrested in the fake encounter case.

 Phone conversations between the accused show they were in touch before and after the killings of gangster Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kauser Bi, an updated probe report is believed to have told the Supreme Court.

 Records of these conversations will be a key piece of evidence to establish there was a conspiracy to eliminate the couple.

 The special investigating teams report, placed before the court in a sealed cover, also says that the confession of one of the seven accused has been recorded by a magistrate and would be admissible as evidence, sources said.

 The Gujarat government has already admitted that its police had shot Sohrabuddin in a fake encounter in November 2005, claiming he planned to assassinate chief minister Narendra Modi. The police are also accused of killing Kauser, a witness.

 The report said forensic and other scientific tests were being conducted as part of the probe into Kausers death, and the reports would be available in four weeks.

 The state government told the court that seven arrests had been made and some more were likely soon. It added that inspector-general Geeta Johri, who is leading the investigation, had gone to Hyderabad to ascertain the role of the Andhra Pradesh police in the killings.

 Johri, who had conducted the preliminary inquiry, had sometime ago been removed from the investigation. After questions were raised about this, the court had sought a report from the state government.

 The government, which then reinstated her, today explained that Johri had been removed to ensure objectivity. Usually, the officer heading the preliminary inquiry doesnt also conduct the official investigation that follows.

 While reinstating Johri, the state had, however, created another controversy by removing deputy inspector-general Rajnish Rai, who had been heading the investigation after Johris removal.

 Sohrabuddins brother Rubabuddin, whose petition to the apex court had taken the covers off the fake encounter scandal, has sought Rais return to the probe team.

 He said he had only questioned Johris removal, and had never asked for Rai, who had made the first three arrests, to be shifted.

 Johri, being a senior officer, could be back in the team without any need to strip Rai of his powers, Rubabuddin said.

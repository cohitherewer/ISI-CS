 Kite cord slashes neck, kid dies

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 String of death

 Chennai, May 29: A helmet would have swallowed his tiny head, but it could have saved little Deshank.

 The two-year-old died after a kite string, dipped in a chemical mix and sharpened by powdered glass, cut through the tender veins of his neck as he rode on his fathers motorbike on Sunday evening.

 By the time the boy was rushed to hospital, it was too late.

 The tragedy has happened at a time when Chennai police are gearing up to force even those who ride pillion, including children, to wear helmets from June 1, though many, among them a top political leader, are against the move. In a recent public appeal to the police, PMK boss S. Ramadoss had asked them not to enforce the rule as it could inconvenience women.

 Now, after Deshanks death, the police are hoping that all those who are opposing the drive will come round.

 Deshank and his father Sarath Babu were returning from a relatives house in the city when the bright yellow thread of the kite slashed the little boys neck. As blood spurted from the cut, the traumatised father rushed the kid to the Government Childrens Hospital.

 But Deshank had already lost too much blood and the doctors at the hospital could do little to save him.

 Sarath Babu didnt file a police complaint, but it didnt stop a civil engineer from landing in jail yesterday.

 With the hospital informing the police, the law-keepers had intensified their vigil against kite flying in public places. And the first to fall in the net was the engineer, identified as Narayana Moorthy.

 The police also seized manja mix or manja kayaru as it is called in Tamil used to make the kite stronger and sharper from the engineers house.

 Police sources said a law is already in place that bans people from flying kites in public places as it could harm people. From now, we will implement the law more stringently, said a source.

 Tips galore for jackpot winner

 He could be the most sought-after client in town, though he lives in a 180-square-foot rented Dadar chawl and is struggling to repay a loan of Rs 90,000.

 But Girish Rathod has just won a Super Lotto jackpot that has made him richer by Rs 2.09 crore.

 Ever since, the KEM Hospital sweeper hasnt been able to stop the steady stream of guests and advice on how to use the booty. 

 ut Girish has made his choice: Bank of Maharashtra. At least three chartered accountants wanted to be his tax consultant. 

 Girish, whos since become Girishbhai (the ring of affluence around the moniker is obvious), is also clear about his priorities. A flat for his family is first. Then, he would like to see his three children in residential schools. Some of the cash could also go in clearing debts from colleagues. 

 I want my son Karan to become a doctor, my daughter Kirti to become an advocate and my younger son, Pratham, to be a football player. I want to give them everything that I could not enjoy, says the lucky father.

 Team India album, in a bottle

 This man has put the entire Indian cricket team into a bottle. Artist Basavaraju Somaraje Gowda has painstakingly recreated a photo frame with all 15 members of the Indian World Cup team inside a bottle.

 I had to put in four sticks first. Then I joined them to complete the frame. Later, I rolled up the picture printed on art paper and put it inside the bottle. Inside, I allowed it to unfold. Then came the tricky part. Little hard board pieces were inserted, and stuck to the paper so that the photo rested well on the frame. 

 Sounds quite easy, but it took Gowda (in picture by Keshav Vitla), an electrician by profession, all of seven days to pull off the feat. He is, however, not new to the art, having created a model of a windmill inside a bottle. The mills blades turned when connected to a battery. This effort fetched him a mention in the Limca Book of Records. 

 Now, Gowda is looking for a sponsor to carry the bottle to the West Indies so that he can present it to the Men in Blue.

 Telegrams rain on CM

 It was a carpet-bombing of another kind on the Tamil Nadu chief ministers office last Saturday. Thousands of telegrams addressed to M. Karunanidhi began pouring in. They were sent by people in danger of losing their homes to an airport upgrade.

 Residents of villages near the Chennai airport decided to launch the novel protest, saying the expansion shouldnt go ahead in its present form. 

 Those complaining want the government to find land away from the city and build a new airport rather than expand the existing one at Meenambakkam.

 Interestingly, the onerous task of receiving and delivering the cartloads of telegrams fell on the department of posts and telegraphs, overseen by telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran, Karunanidhis grand-nephew.

 Safe driving

 One thought there was a problem with buses. They are either missing when you need them the most or take you to a destination youd known would come at a ripe age. 

 As if death, delays and erratic service werent enough, now the city has a problem with where buses halt.

 A high court bench has asked the Delhi Transport Corporation to file a report on the money spent on new bus stands and on the improvement of existing ones. It wants authorities to ensure that each stop has enough space to accommodate three to four buses. 

 The idea, apparently, is to avoid traffic jams. Told that cameras had been installed at intersections, the judges said the money can be better used to train people in safe driving.

NATION BRIEFS

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 6: Forty-three students of Balachhadi Sainik School in Jamnagar ran away from their hostels on Sunday night after seniors allegedly ragged them, sometimes hitting them with belts. 

 Villagers spotted the boys all in Class X on the sea shore, about 20km from the school, around 11.30pm and informed police. The students said they had complained to the school management earlier but no action was taken. It took the police hours to persuade the boys to return to their hostels.

 The school denied that the boys had fled because of ragging but said they had a scuffle with their seniors on Sunday.

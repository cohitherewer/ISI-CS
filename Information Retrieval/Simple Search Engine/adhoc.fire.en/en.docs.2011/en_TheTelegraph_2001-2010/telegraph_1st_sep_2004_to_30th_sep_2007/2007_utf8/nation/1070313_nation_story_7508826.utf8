 Rare works, in Shiva linga and rudraksh 

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Palm leaf manuscripts containing verses from Jayadevas Gita Govindam rolled into bead-like pieces to form a rudraksh garland from a private collection in Orissa; a set of rare manuscripts arranged in the form of a Shiva linga from a private collection in Karnataka 

 Chennai, March 12: If you thought our forefathers were learned folks who packed a lot of wisdom into their writings but knew precious little about preserving them, think again.

 Latest findings show the ancients had also devised their own unique way of passing on rare literary works for coming generations.

 Take, for instance, the Gita Govindam, the 12th-century literary-religious classic by the poet Jayadeva in what is modern-day Orissa. 

 The work, which celebrates Lord Krishna as lover and Radhas object of devotion, has been meticulously chiselled on palm leaves and rolled into tiny beads that have been strung into a rudraksh garland.

 Another example, this time from Karnataka, reveals how the ancients even used sacred objects as time capsules.

 The Veerashaivas, who are known for their fierce and patriotic worship of Lord Shiva, have left for posterity a yet-to-be deciphered manuscript that has been literally arranged and shaped like a Shiva linga. 

 It could pass off as another do-not-touch-me object of worship until you have put on your reading glasses.

 These are some of the rare private collections which the National Mission for Manuscripts recently retrieved and which saw the light of day at Chennai Museum when the NMM took stock of its five-year all-India project to save valuable assets of our cultural heritage.

 The mission, launched by the Union culture ministry in February 2003, has completed four years. It prompted a review of the project which saw experts, scholars, students, institutions like state archives, groups like the traditional siddha medical practitioners and private collectors play a key role in restoring and conserving manuscripts.

 Project coordinator Dr V. Jeyaraj said the manuscripts come not only in various shapes but also in different mediums, including writings on gold leaf, wood, copper plates and even on silk.

 Among the works on display at a recent interaction among all the stakeholders were the earliest commentary on the classical Tamil treatise Thirukkural and pages from the ancient Tamil grammar text Tholkappiyam.

 In the last four years, about 30 lakh manuscripts have been identified and restored. They are now being catalogued, Jeyaraj said. Of these, six lakh have been retrieved in Tamil Nadu alone.

 Students from schools and colleges were pressed into service and told to go from village to village to collect rare manuscripts from households, temples, mutts and other monastic institutions in various states, Jeyaraj said. Another 30 lakh manuscripts are being identified and documented throughout the country, he added.

 As palm leaf manuscripts are likely to perish because of wear and tear over the next 50 to 100 years, the manuscript mission has decided to digitise the rare works, Jeyaraj said.

 The Manuscripts Resource Centre, set up in each state, has been assigned the task of collecting, cataloguing and storing the manuscripts.

 Among the rare manuscripts selected for digitising as part of a pilot project in five states are 4,000 Vaishnava scripts in Assam, 3,500 illustrated manuscripts in Orissa, 6,000 in Jammu and Kashmir, 1,000 Kodiyattam texts in Kerala and about 6,500 siddha manuscripts of Tamil Nadu, Jeyaraj said.

 Ahmedabad, Sept. 24: Five coaches of the Mumbai-bound Awadh Express were charred in an early-morning fire near Bharuch on Monday but no passengers were injured. 

 The cause of the fire was not known but railway officials ruled out sabotage.

 Some panic-stricken travellers jumped out, though the train was stopped at Palej station, near Bharuch, by a passenger who spotted the fire in one of the coaches and pulled the chain.

 But the blaze spread quickly and, within minutes, the four adjoining coaches were charred.

 Fire tenders could not reach the spot because there was no approach road, Prashant Kumar, the railway commissioner of safety, said.

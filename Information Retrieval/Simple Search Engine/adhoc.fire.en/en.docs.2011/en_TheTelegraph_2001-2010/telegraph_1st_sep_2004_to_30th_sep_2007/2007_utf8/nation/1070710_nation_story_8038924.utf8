 IIM Lucknow: Preparing for quota regime

 Calcutta, July 9: Reservation for OBC students in the Indian Institutes of Management may have been stayed this year, but the business schools have already started preparing for the eventuality. 

 At a recent meeting of the CAT Group a six-member committee with representatives from all six IIMs it was decided that applicants who take the test this year will be asked to state if they are from the Other Backward Classes while filling the forms.

 When the committee met to draw up the brochures and other details for CAT 2007, it was also decided that students would be asked to mention whether they belong to the OBC category, said Ashish Bhattacharyya, chairman of the admissions committee, IIM Calcutta. 

 Bhattacharyya is a member of the CAT Group that holds the nationwide entrance test. 

 That the UPA government is committed to introduce OBC reservation in institutes like the IITs and the IIMs has triggered the move. 

 But the IITs are yet to take a call on this. We have not yet taken any decision on OBC reservation. It is too early to say what will happen, said A.N. Shamanta, vice-chairman, JEE, IIT Kharagpur, hinting that the engineering institutes are awaiting instructions from Delhi. 

 But the IIMs have firmed up their plans. Along with the regular general category and SC/ST boxes, the forms for CAT 2007 to be issued from July 16 will also have a box asking whether the applicant is an OBC.

 The test will be held on November 18.

 We wanted to make preparations in case the stay on the OBC reservations is lifted by the time admissions for the next session starts, said Bhattacharyya. 

 This year, the results of the IIM admissions were delayed by 15 days to April 27 after the Centre asked the institutes not to release the general and OBC admission lists following the Supreme Courts stay on the 27 per cent quota.

 On April 27, the government decided to give the green signal to the general category list, putting the OBC list on hold till the next hearing.

 The IIMs also put the seat hikes planned to accommodate reserved-category candidates on hold, and admitted the same number of students taken in the last academic session.

 IIM Ahmedabad took in 250 students instead of the planned 280. IIM Calcutta took in 300 students instead of 318.

 Fliers fume at 12-hour wait

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 15: Furious Air-India passengers to Dubai tried to stop people from boarding other flights out of the airport today after the public carrier kept them waiting several hours beyond scheduled departure.

 The passengers finally left for Dubai at 5.30 in the afternoon, 12 hours late, but only after the airline had managed to accommodate them in a bigger aircraft.

 The trouble began when over 230 passengers of the Mumbai-Dubai Flight 727 assembled for check-in at 3.30 am, only to discover that the Air-India management had allotted only two counters to handle the formalities.

 Though the scheduled departure was at 5.30 am, the check-in went on till 6.30 am, with no announcement about the flight, said a passenger who had to report for work in Dubai on Tuesday morning.

 The passengers said there was no information on when the flight would leave, though it was well past the time of departure, nor did it depute any managers to look after them until it was almost 10.

 It was only after the passengers raised their voice that an Air-India manager arrived on the scene, but he could not provide any clear information on the flights status.

 After a while, the passengers said, they were told they would be put on a flight to Dubai via New Delhi at 1.30 pm.

 Air-India failed to keep that promise, too. The airline then informed the passengers that a direct Mumbai-Dubai flight had been arranged, and issued fresh boarding passes for a 4 pm flight.

 The departure was again rescheduled to 5 pm. Finally, the flight left at 5.30 pm.

 An Air-India spokesperson said the incoming flight from Dubai had been delayed and that caused further delays.

 But he denied that the agitated passengers tried to stop travellers from boarding other international flights.

 Back to the sun, CM joins salute

 Bhopal: Baba Ramdev stayed away, the 

 chief minister made a faux pas and a Class VI boy fainted 

 during the mass surya namaskar in Madhya Pradesh 

 on Thursday.

 In the end, the cavalier way the programme was held and the politics around it meant the fine art of yoga was the loser, leading exponents said.

 Shivraj Singh Chauhan joined in 

 the salute to the sun but he did the exercise with his 

 back towards the celestial body. Asked about it, he got 

 angry.

 Its not an issue. You people (the media) have a habit of making issues out of non-issues. We are for a healthy Madhya Pradesh. The surya namaskar is a wonderful exercise but we have made it optional.

 The BJP government had little choice after Jabalpur High Court, hearing petitions from the Jamait Ulema-i-Hind and Bharatiya Muslim Sangh, passed an interim order on Wednesday saying participation should be voluntary. 

 State education minister Narottam Mishra said the programme, held at government schools, drew over 3 lakh students.

 But Ramdev, the celebrity yoga guru expected to lend weight to the governments drive, was away in Bangkok.

 City-based yoga experts A.S. Jain and Kalpna Shukla protested against the way in which the programme was organised. The students should not have got up and walked away immediately after the surya namaskar. They should have done a relaxation exercise, Shukla said.

 In Shahdol, Class VI student Uttam Bhujia fainted from dehydration during the programme at Saraswati Shishu Mandir. He recovered after being given an oral rehydration solution. Reports of schoolchildren suffering headache and general discomfort were received from many other schools.

 Nimbus rate

 New Delhi (PTI): A consumer 

 group has challenged Trais decision to fix the bouquet 

 price of Neo Sports and Neo Sports Plus at Rs 37.25, saying 

 it is excessive and unrealistic.

 Gunmen rap

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme 

 Court has asked the Uttar Pradesh government as to explain 

 under what law gunmen were provided to hundreds of individuals 

 with questionable credentials. It also refused 

 to stay the Allahabad High Court order to withdraw gunmen 

 assigned to student leaders. 

 Youth shot 

 Sonepat (PTI): Unidentified 

 men shot dead a youth at Barota village in Haryana after 

 informing his family over the phone on Wednesday. The reason 

 behind Mangals murder is not known, police said.

 An idol of Jesus Christ resembling a meditating Buddha will 

 be consecrated in a church in Kollam, Kerala. The idol depicts 

 the Christ sitting in a padmasanam posture.

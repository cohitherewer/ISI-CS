The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 For capital, 1857 once more 

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, June 4: Mobs of stone-throwing, bus-burning Gujjar young men blocked traffic on every major road out of Delhi today, presenting the capital its most complete siege in living memory.

 Roads to Gurgaon and Faridabad to the south saw the worst violence with clashes between a joint police-paramilitary force and protesters demanding Scheduled Tribe status for Gujjars in Rajasthan.

 In the east, tension spilled inwards from the Uttar Pradesh border, and the flames leaping from burning vehicles and tyres forced many office-goers to take the day off.

 The entire Delhi police, along with 10 Border Security Force battalions, had taken up position last night, aware that the National Capital Region bandh wouldnt be peaceful.

 The preparation fire engines, water cannons and ambulances posted overnight at all possible trouble spots helped the police quell the early morning attacks. But what neither the police nor residents had prepared for was the scale of the Gujjar onslaught that followed.

 An eyewitness account:

 9.45 am: You can smell the burning rubber a few hundred metres from the Badarpur border post to Haryana, but the odour turns particularly noxious as you approach the burning van on National Highway 2.

 The police lob tear gas shells from the safety of a bus shelter, pushing back a mob of about 1,000.

 Sare road bandh kar diye hain inhone. Aisa attack to sirf suna tha 1857 ke bare me (theyve blocked all the roads into Delhi. One had heard of such attacks only in relation to 1857), says a policemen, his voice muffled by the handkerchief covering his face to save him from the fumes.

 In 1857, it was the British laying siege to the rebels, who included the Gujjars, holed up in Delhi. Its the Gujjars ringing the capital now as India commemorates 150 years of that first war of independence.

 Over the next two hours, the protesters regroup, burn two more buses and thrash two policemen and three BSF jawans. In the end, they are beaten back with lathis.

 10.30 am: The road most commuters take between Delhi and Gurgaon the Mehrauli-Gurgaon road is blocked near Ghitorni village from where hordes pour out, threatening to torch public transport.

 A few village elders plead in vain with the youth to use peaceful means, such as a sit-in.

 Police trying to enter the village are beaten back with a shower of rocks. Traffic is diverted a kilometre before Ghitorni. Late in the evening, the shortest route between Delhi and the IT hub of Gurgaon is still blocked.

 11 am: Government bus drivers, finding the Mehrauli-Gurgaon road blocked, work their way though narrow lanes towards the Aya Nagar bypass. But Aya Nagar, near the Qutab Minar, is getting ready for battle. 

 Small petrol bombs and thousands of bricks are being handed out to battle-ready youth.

 No passenger is hurt: the protesters, torch in hand, ask them to get off. Many of the IT professionals reach for their cellphones, calling office to say they wont be able to make it before dialling their families to recount the drama.

 Its harder for 22-year-old Anil Mishra, on his way to a job interview with a Gurgaon travel agency. 

 Thankfully, they understood when I called up. I will have my interview next Monday, he says.

 Five police constables and three BSF jawans, trying to enter Aya Nagar, are pulled into houses and thrashed.

 The personnel beaten up at Aya Nagar and Badarpur are being treated at AIIMS. One police constable is critically injured.

 11.45 am: East of the Yamuna, effigies of Vasundhara Raje are still being burnt. Blockades on the Noida Link Road, connecting east Delhi to Noida, have mostly been cleared but traffic is thinner than usual.

 Weve taken the day off and are going shopping for groceries. The riots may start again, so were stocking up. I was too scared to let my children come with me, says Rajeev Multani, senior manager at a Greater Noida software firm, from his red Santro.

 Noon: National Highway 24 to Ghaziabad is being cleared as well.

 A fire engine spouts water at a burning tyre near Ghazipur Chowk as policemen continue to divert traffic. Things are under control but we want to clear up all the mess before opening the roads to traffic, says inspector Sunil Mishra.

 Its 2 pm when traffic resumes.

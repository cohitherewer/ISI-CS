 Hizbollah salve on Arab-India wound

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 New Delhi, March 13: The Arab world, and not India, should be blamed for the huge psychological distance that has grown between the two regions and for allowing New Delhi to come closer to Israel, Hizbollah representative Ali Fayyad has said.

 Refusing to criticise India for voting against Irans nuclear programme at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Fayyad pointed out that New Delhi should, in fact, use its influence as a big country to intervene in the stand-off between Iran and the western world.

 In an interview on the sidelines of a conference, War, Anti-Imperialism and Resistance in West Asia, the Hizbollah representative spoke freely and frankly about the big mess in the Arab world today.

 We accuse Arab countries, we hold them responsible for allowing such a big country like India to come close to Israel. Arab states have no effective foreign policy, they have lost many friends in the world, Fayyad said.

 In fact, the Iraqi resistance, increasingly fundamentalist and splintered, should learn from the Hizbollah movement in Lebanon, unify itself and end the American occupation of Iraq, the Hizbollah representative added.

 This is the first time in recent memory that a spokesman for the Hizbollah has been allowed into India. 

 Considering that Left leaders like Prakash Karat and A.B. Bardhan will speak at the conference tomorrow, it seems as if New Delhi is making a deliberate attempt to balance the perception that the Manmohan Singh government leans heavily in favour of the United States and Israel. 

 Fayyad didnt deny that the Hizbollah wielded great influence in West Asia and the Gulf. But he insisted that since it was a Lebanon-based movement, he didnt want to get involved in the internal politics of Iran. 

 Irans nuclear programme is an Iranian issue, it has nothing to do with the Hizbollah, Fayyad added.

 On Irans perceived determination to abrogate its obligations to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and go nuclear, Fayyad indicated that this was a western conspiracy. 

 Today, even the Iranian religious leadership is saying nuclear weapons are horrible and that Iran will not pursue that path.

 At the conference, the audience seemed hugely relieved as it occasionally erupted into a denunciation of Americas invasion of Iraq, its perceived readiness to attack Iran and, generally, what it saw as a wholesome critique of the ugly superpower.

 When one of the participants, Kamal Majid from Iraq, pointed out that India had better be warned that after Iran, it would be Indias turn, there was much good-natured cheering much like a college night out.

 To a question from this reporter on choosing between the secular dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and America, Majid pointed out that at least Saddam didnt destroy whole cities in an attempt to install democracy.

 But other participants, like Fawwaz Traboulsi, an intellectual with the Lebanese American University, and Ali Atassi, a journalist in Beirut, pointed out that this was no choice at all. 

 Fayyad later said the Hizbollah had major differences, from the root with groups like al Qaida.

 He made no bones about blaming the Arab regimes for the mess within the Arab world.

 The Arab world is completely divided on all issues, whether it was the infighting in Palestine or in Iraq, the Hizbollah representative added.

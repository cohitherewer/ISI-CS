The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Karat China barb

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 31: Prakash Karat today said the CPMs stand on the nuclear deal had nothing to do with China and suggested those making such allegations were ignorant or bought over.

 Much of our media is bought over. The reason given for our objections is that we are pro-China, the CPM general secretary said. Some ignorant people may think we are trying to create a China-India axis. Our stand has no relation with what China is thinking.

 As he spoke about US hegemony, however, Karat said the US wanted Delhi to act as a counterweight against Beijings political, military and economic might.

 India has a huge market and a strong military force. Thats why the US administration wants to harness Indias power as a counterweight against China, he said.

 Kidney seller to conduit

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Jan. 16: Some private hospitals in Madurai and Chennai are under watch after a kidney sale racket involving tsunami survivors was exposed last week.

 Preliminary investigations at the tsunami shelter in Ernavur, outside north Chennai where at least 40 fisherwomen sold their kidneys out of poverty, have found that the first donors guided and sometimes goaded others into following suit.

 The fisherwomen who initially sold their kidneys unwittingly turned into contacts between the hospital and brokers and potential donors, bringing new people into the alleged racket for a small cut from the brokers, police said. 

 When the first sellers introduce others from their colony to a broker, having a known face in the chain is reassuring for potential donors and makes them more comfortable with the idea of selling an organ. Also, they feel they will not be cheated outright, even though many have been given only Rs 40,000-50,000 when they were promised Rs 1 lakh. 

 It (sale of kidneys) looks like poor people from the slum areas of Chennai regularly donating blood for money, said Kannappan, a deputy commissioner of police who is heading a special team probing the racket.

 The police are doing a detailed survey of Tsunami Nagar and the adjoining Ennore coastal area to unravel the donor-broker-hospitals nexus, he said. 

 When the racket came to light last week with some of the women themselves spilling the beans, it was thought that all those who had sold their kidneys were fisherwomen living in the shelter after being displaced from coastal villages like Kasimedu and Ennore by the December 2004 tsunami. Construction of permanent houses for tsunami survivors in the area has been delayed. 

 It is now known that a few fishermen had also sold their kidneys. 

 Kannappan said the sale of kidneys was a much wider phenomenon in the slum areas of Chennai, not limited to tsunami survivors. During the probe in the last few days, the police have identified three areas Villivakkam, Otteri and Kasimedu where a network of brokers gets people to part with their kidneys for a promised sum. 

 While the sale of any organ is an offence, voluntary donation is legal if properly screened by the committees concerned in private hospitals. Invariably, the sale is masked as a donation, Kannappan said. Certain blood groups like + are preferred and paid more than those having less universal blood groups.

 Nepal inches to govt minus monarchy 

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Koirala, Prachanda 

 Kathmandu, March 27: Nepal inched closer to the formation of an interim government including the Maoists after Prime Minister G.P. Koirala and chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) Prachanda came to an informal understanding that the interim parliament should be empowered to remove monarchy.

 An amendment to the interim constitution will allow the abolition of monarchy by a two-thirds majority of the interim legislature. The Nepali Congress which has been ambiguous on monarchy will also unequivocally announce that it favours a republic.

 The informal agreement, according to reliable sources, is that the constitution amendment would be moved within two weeks. Koirala is also believed to have agreed to publicly announce the changed position of his party, the Nepali Congress, on monarchy.

 Koirala is scheduled to address four public meetings in preparation for constituent assembly elections scheduled for June after he returns from attending the Saarc summit in Delhi. He is expected to make the announcement at one of these public meetings. The other major constituent of the alliance the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) already stands for republicanism.

 The concerns of the Maoists about the monarchists have been heightened by the massacre of 29 of their cadres in Gaur in the Rautahat district of Nepal in the Terai last week. 

 Prachanda and Baburam Bhattarai are convinced that monarchist forces engineered the massacre. Hired professional criminals seem to have killed the Maoists the bodies of some of the victims had small arms on them which they had no time to use.

 To be able to pave the way for abolishing monarchy before the constituent assembly elections is considered more important by the Maoists than quibbling over portfolios in the interim government. Although they are yet to drop their demand for the deputy Prime Ministers post, under the new compromise they may not push for it.

 The central committee of the Maoists is yet to ratify joining the interim government. If they do not get key portfolios and the schedule for the constituent assembly elections is not announced, then they see little sense in joining the interim government. However, the compromise on empowering the interim parliament to abolish monarchy is a victory and can be projected as such to their otherwise restive cadre.

 Prachanda is scheduled to convey the decision of his party to Prime Minister Koirala early tomorrow morning. If he is able to convince his central committee that the party has extracted its pound of flesh for joining the government, then the interim government could be announced either tomorrow itself or on Thursday.

 On April 1, Koirala leaves for the Saarc summit in Delhi. Apparently, he also made it very clear to the Maoists that he did not wish to go for the summit as a caretaker Prime Minister. 

 Various persons have impressed upon him that if he goes after forming a government with the Maoists, his stature as a peacemaker would be very different than if he went as a weak Prime Minister unable to move the peace process to its next logical step.

 If the Maoists get their way on monarchy, then everything else associated with government formation will slowly fall into place. Only the interim government can announce the date for the proposed constituent assembly elections or reschedule it.

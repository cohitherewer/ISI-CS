 New Delhi, Jan. 23: BJP president Rajnath Singh did not even wait for the partys central election committee to meet today before announcing former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhus candidature for the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat.

 Within moments of the Supreme Court clearing the way for Sidhu to contest the elections, Rajnath beamed at the waiting cameras. I am thrilled at the courts verdict, he said. Sidhu is now the BJPs candidate from Amritsar. 

 Sidhu had resigned from the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat after he was convicted for causing the death of a man. He later filed an application in the apex court asking for a stay on the conviction and permission to make a fresh bid for the Lok Sabha from the Golden Temple city.

 I always had the blessings of people of India and my elders with me, Sidhu told PTI after he got the stay. I submitted to the majesty of the law and the apex court stayed my conviction and sentence, he said. 

 Rajnaths hurry to declare Sidhus name is being attributed more to quashing any discussion about the possibility of party general secretary Arun Jaitley contesting from Amritsar rather than promoting Sidhus case.

 Although the BJPs election committee met in the evening to formally finalise candidates for poll-bound Punjab and Uttarakhand, Rajnaths announcement ensured that there was no ambiguity or scope left for a debate on Amritsar. 

 Realising that the odds were stacked against him, Jaitley marched into the party headquarters with Sidhu this afternoon, assured TV crews that he would help the cricketer in the run-up to the poll and laughed off questions about his own candidature.

 Agar yeh khud larna chahte to hamare liye itni mehnat kyon karte (Why would he work so hard to save me if he wanted to contest from Amritsar)? replied Sidhu when asked if he was aware of Jaitleys name being considered as a possible candidate.

 Dont ask me anything else. Main chup rahunga (I will keep quiet), he said.

 This is the third time the party has foiled the chances of a prominent second-rung leader to enter the Lok Sabha. The first occasion was when Jaitley, along with Sushma Swaraj and Pramod Mahajan, wanted to contest during the 2004 general elections. But the then party president, M. Venkaiah Naidu, decided otherwise.

 The bypoll in the Vidisha Lok Sabha seat was another such opportunity. Jaitleys and Sushmas names were talked about as possible candidates but the party decided against fielding either.

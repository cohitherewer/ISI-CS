 Vaccine volunteer scan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 27: Officials associated with the AIDS research said they would continue to follow up volunteers of the vaccine trials for five years.

 The clarification came after concerns were raised over the virus used to transmit genes in vaccine trials.

 The volunteers are regularly checked to ensure that they have had no serious consequences to the candidate vaccine, officials of the National AIDS Research Institute (Nari), Pune, said.

 Nari scientists pointed out that there are stark differences in the way the laboratory mice used in the US study and humans received the virus. The mice had received intravenous injections, but the humans got the virus in their muscles.

 The mice received much larger doses of the virus than any human has been given, a Nari scientist, who requested anonymity, said.

 Commenting on the death of an arthritis patient in the US, a spokesperson for vaccine company Targeted Genetics said it was not a tumour incident. 

 The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) said there are differences in the AAV (adeno-associated virus) product used in the arthritis and HIV vaccine trials. 

 The AAV-based AIDS vaccine underwent very extensive safety studies in hundreds of small animals as well as non-human primates before it was introduced into humans, IAVI said in a statement. Data is complete on the first part of the safety study and no serious vaccine-related adverse events have occurred, it said.

 10 years for Sanjay arms courier

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, June 6: More uneasy tidings were in store for Sanjay Dutt today as one of the three men convicted of delivering firearms to his Pali Hill bungalow was given 10 years in jail.

 The anti-terror court awarded Baba Musa Chauhan rigorous imprisonment and fined him Rs 3 lakh for acquiring and distributing three AK-56 rifles and a 9 mm pistol to the stars Bandra home.

 Producer Samir Hingora and don Abu Salem had accompanied Chauhan, who runs a motor training school.

 It was Chauhan who first revealed the involvement of producers Hingora and Hanif Kadawala, owners of Magnum Video, in the 1993 blasts conspiracy. Kadawala, in turn, first dropped Sanjays name, leading to the actors arrest in April 1993. He also told police about the close links Hingora and Kadawala had with Anees Ibrahim.

 With Chauhans sentencing, three of the 10 linked with Sanjays case have been punished. Hingora was awarded nine years in jail last week and Manzoor Ahmed 10. Salem is yet to go on trial.

 Sanjay and three others have been summoned by the court tomorrow. But sources said a verdict on their probation petition is likely only next week. Last week, Sanjay was spotted nervously watching the court punish Hingora.

 The director was Anees, the second director was Samir, the fieldsman was Salem and his assistant was Chauhan, Judge Pramod Kode said as he handed out sentences under the anti-terror law, Explosives Substances Act and Explosives Act. All sentences will run concurrently with a maximum term of 10 years.

 The evidence denotes that he (Chauhan) distributed the weapons at the instance of Anees, and not Tiger (Memon), Kode said, adding that there was no cementing material to prove that he was part of the conspiracy.

 He was dancing to the tune of Salem, the judge said. 

 An AK-56, 635 cartridges, 10 magazines and 25 grenades were found on Chauhan.

 The court awarded a five-year jail term to hawala operator Mulchand Shah, who funnelled money through Memons bank accounts. He was also fined Rs 5 lakh.

 He was some sort of a banker of Tiger Memon prior to the conspiracy, Kode said.

 A life term was given to Memons bodyguard Sardar Shahwali Khan, who attended two conspiracy meetings in Mumbai. He is the tenth person to be given a life term.

 The court said he was present at Memons Mahim residence when RDX was packed into vehicles on the night before the March 12 blasts.

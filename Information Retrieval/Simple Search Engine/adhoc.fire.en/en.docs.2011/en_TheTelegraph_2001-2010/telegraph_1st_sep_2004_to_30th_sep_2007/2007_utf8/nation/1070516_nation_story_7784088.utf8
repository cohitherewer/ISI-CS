 Manners pat for Mamata

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mamata

 New Delhi, May 15: The stirrings of peace in Bengal could be heard in Parliament today. 

 Mamata Banerjee spoke on farmland acquisition without dragging Nandigram a state issue into it. 

 There were aberrations, but so few that she earned a rare good-conduct certificate from the Speaker: You are doing very well.

 When Mamata referred to the killings in Nandigram, she did not make a direct reference to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government.

 When she got slightly more specific at the tail end of her speech, Somnath Chatterjee said: Its a state matter. Ill not allow it.

 Mamata returned to Parliament yesterday after several weeks in Bengal. 

 During zero hour today, she demanded that the Centre scrap the colonial land acquisition law of 1894 and come up with a better alternative. Its a black law, she said.

 She also wanted the Centres special economic zone policy scrapped and a new one framed taking farmers concerns into account. 

 Most of the time, the Trinamul Congress chief stuck to Chatterjees condition for allowing her to raise land acquisition in the House not mentioning the N-word. 

 But there were spats between her and the Left MPs when she spoke of the murders in Nandigram and asked the Centre to intervene as the issue also concerned women and children and minorities, who suffered while opposing forcible acquisition. 

 When the Left din drowned Mamatas words, the Speaker came to her defence, saying she was not referring to the state government. 

 Mamata flashed papers, claiming they were affidavits by Singur farmers saying they never agreed to the acquisition. She also asked the Centre to send a medical team to Nandigram and urged Sonia Gandhi to go there. The Centre cant remain mum.

 BJP MPs repeatedly rose to her defence. As did the odd Congress member.

 When the exchanges got shriller, Chatterjee adjourned the House, 15 minutes ahead of the lunch break.

 There was some sniping before Mamata began. She wanted to speak as soon as zero hour started and made it clear she was unhappy with the Speaker asking her to wait for her turn.

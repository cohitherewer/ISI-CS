 SC fills status void in statute

 The Supreme Court: Setting minority benchmark

 New Delhi, April 6: The Constitution, which has accorded special status to linguistic and religious minorities, does not define the word minority a void that the Supreme Court has helped fill through its various decisions and an advisory opinion sought by the President. 

 An 11-judge Constitution bench in 2002 clarified that the population of a community in a state would be the deciding factor for its minority status, not its numbers in the whole of India.

 This ruling came in the T.M.A. Pai Foundation case.

 Although the majority judgment was silent on the exact percentage of population that would give a community the right to seek minority status, Justice V.N. Khare recorded in a separate judgment that a community could get minority status if its population was less than 50 per cent. 

 In 1958, a six-judge bench, while giving advisory opinion to the President, had accepted an argument that a community which was numerically less than 50 per cent of the total population of a state could be notified as a minority for according special treatment. 

 The court had followed the same line in 1971 when a decision to accord minority status to Arya Samajis in Punjab was challenged.

 After examining the courts 1958 advisory opinion in the Kerala Education Bill case, the court held that Arya Samajis who were Hindus were a religious minority in the state of Punjab, though they may not have been so in relation to the country. 

 The apex court rejected the contention that since Hindus were a majority in India, they could not be a religious minority in Punjab, as it took the state as the unit to determine whether the Hindus were a minority community.

 The T.M.A. Pai ruling reconsidered the matter and reiterated that the population in the state had to be the deciding factor in such cases. 

 The court said linguistic and religious minorities were covered by the expression minority under Article 30 of the Constitution and the test for both had to be the same.

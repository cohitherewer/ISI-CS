 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Clean up your act or take up broom

 Mumbai 

 litterbugs have to choose between a fine of Rs 500 and a 

 community service that could mean a clean sweep for two 

 long hours. Neighbours will cherish those images.

 So, if you dump mess in public, this is Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporations way to force you to tidy things up. 

 A private agency will enforce the order. The drive began in south Mumbai last week, but will reach eastern and western suburbs in a month.

 A corporation official is expected to escort liveried employees of the private firm to make sure they face no troublemakers in implementing the anti-littering rule. 

 At least 6,000 garbage bins will be placed across the city next month and 800 vehicles, including compactors, will be bought to ferry mounds of garbage to dumping grounds. 

 The new bins have firm lids this will keep stray cattle in the neighbourhoods from prising open the box of filth. The drive will cost around Rs 400 crore.

 Giant idea for chilled beer

 Beer-guzzlers 

 may be a happier lot this summer with chilled beer easier 

 to find.

 Liquor outlets of the Delhi State Civil Supplies Corporation will put up giant-sized wheeled refrigerators outside their shops to increase sales.

 Seekers of beer may look forward to more of the chilled stuff and shorter queues. Some 15 wheeled refrigerators each capable of holding up to 500 beer bottles will be set up at prime outlets of the corporation.

 The beer season is about to begin and customers tend to prefer it chilled, said Nita Bali, chairperson of the corporation. 

 When its not available chilled, people drink elsewhere, perhaps in a restaurant, and end up paying extra. 

 The corporation sells up to 50,000 cases of beer each week in summer. Last year, small refrigerators in shops fuelled a 40 per cent rise in sales.

 Bubble over wine

 Whether 

 its the call of duty or a saga of sagging spirits, 

 the worlds big wine exporters arent ready yet 

 to toast a truce on Indias high duties.

 Despite the high duties, wine imports from France increased 35 per cent, making it the largest processed food item shipped to India by value. 

 The surge swept across Indias high duty wall 264 per cent on wines and 550 per cent on spirits.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath signalled a truce, saying tariffs could tumble, but patience on both sides of the Atlantic is thin. 

 On a visit to India this week, French minister for agriculture and food Nicolas Forissier has been trying to make it easier for his countrys food companies to set up shop here. Helping his harried wine-makers is part of his mission.

 Plaque unites

 They 

 dont stand each other, but they now have a meeting 

 point even if thats on a shining strip of metal.

 Aiyah (Karunanidhi) and Amma (Jayalalithaa) arent known to even swap courtesies in public.

 But they appear next to each other on plaques adorning the lobby of the spanking new twin tower blocks that have been built at Madras Government General Hospital.

 They have good reason to be where they are. Karunanidhi laid the foundation stone for the new structure on March 7, 2001. Jayalalithaa inaugurated it on July 1, 2005.

 The sparkle of the plaques doesnt betray the rancour. 

 But sharing credit for their role in enriching the 350-year-old hospital could be a bitter pill to swallow.

 Delhi: 

 Watch the leading ladies of Indian mythology Ahalya, Draupadi, 

 Sita, Tara and Mandodari come alive in Gayatri Srirams 

 dance performance at India Habitat Centre on March 14 at 

 7 pm. Gayatri is training at Chennais Kalakshetra 

 dance school. Seating is on first-come, first-served basis.

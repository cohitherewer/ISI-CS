The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 MPs spin poll amp; health yarn

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, April 24: If Mohammed doesnt go to the mountain, the mountain must come to Mohammed.

 Delhi police could well be saying so, as they consider sending teams to arrest some of the four MPs who were to be questioned today for their alleged involvement in an illegal immigration racket, but failed to turn up. 

 Named by a key suspect in the racket that came to light with the arrest of BJP MP Babubhai Katara last Wednesday, the four MPs expressed their inability to appear today in faxed replies sent to Mondays notices.

 While there is a willingness to accept the explanations of two MPs as legitimate, the rest could find police teams at their doorstep if they do not turn up in the next four days, or provide genuine reasons for not doing so. 

 The elections in Uttar Pradesh, it seems, are too important for three of the MPs to depose in the case now. Never mind that polls in the Assembly seats in the Lok Sabha constituency of one of them Ashok Kumar Rawat, BSP MP from Mishrikh ended on Monday.

 The elections in his area are over. Its funny that he should tell us (in the fax) that he has to take care of his area and so cant come (to Delhi) any time soon, an official who is part of the investigating team told The Telegraph. 

 According to him, the crime branch of Delhi police is considering sending a team to Mishrikh to escort the MP to Delhi. If the police go on the offensive, Rawat wont be alone.

 The excuse given by Ramswaroop Koli, BJP MP from Rajasthans Bayana, saying he would be unable to travel to Delhi because of health reasons, isnt cutting much ice, either. 

 The only thing holding us back from sending teams to arrest the two (Koli and Rawat) is the political repercussion, the official said, but didnt elaborate. 

 The other two MPs the BSPs Mohammed Tahir Khan and Mitrasen Yadav have also claimed they were too busy with the Uttar Pradesh polls to be able to come to Delhi. The police are willing to give them the benefit of the doubt because voting in their constituencies isnt over. 

 We are giving them time. Parliament starts in a couple of days, so they should be coming to Delhi anyway. By early May, the elections will be over too, the official said. 

 Katara bail plea

 Delhi High Court has rejected the bail petition of Katara and an anticipatory bail plea filed on behalf of his absconding wife Shardaben.

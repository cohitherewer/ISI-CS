 Move to bridge medical quota gap

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates appearing in the all-India entrance examination for postgraduate medical courses will have 22.5 per cent seats reserved for them if the Centre has its way.

 So far, the 22.5 per cent SC/ST quota applied only to the seats 50 per cent of the total filled through the entrance exams conducted by the respective state governments.

 The Centre today sought the Supreme Courts approval for introducing the quota also in the all-India test which fills the remaining 50 per cent seats in Medical Council of India-approved postgraduate courses from the 2007-08 session. The court posted the matter for hearing on January 12 after being told the all-India entrance examination was scheduled for January 14.

 A petition had earlier informed the apex court that the number of seats reserved in the postgraduate medical courses was not 22.5 per cent; it was 22.5 per cent of half the seats, that is 11.25 per cent. The Centre had promised to look into the matter.

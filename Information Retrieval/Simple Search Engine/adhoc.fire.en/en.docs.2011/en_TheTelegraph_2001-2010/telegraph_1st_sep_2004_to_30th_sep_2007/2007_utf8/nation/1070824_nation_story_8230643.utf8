 Go-ahead for uranium unit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: The Centre today cleared a uranium mine and processing plant in Andhra Pradesh that political parties and environment groups had been opposing over radiation fears.

 The project, expected to cost Rs 1,106.29 crore, was cleared by the cabinet committee on economic affairs. The Uranium Corporation of India will mine the deposit, while the Nuclear Power Corporation will set up the processing plant.

 The mine and the processing unit will help meet the fuel requirements of nuclear power plants, finance minister P. Chidambaram said.

 The mine is likely to be commissioned in 30 months, while the processing plant will be up and running in three years. 

 Asked if the project was linked to the Indo-US nuclear deal, Chidambaram said it was not. This is a processing and not a reprocessing plant, the minister added.

 The Congress government in Andhra wants to tap the large deposits of uranium in the states Nalgonda district, a plan that has drawn fire from environment groups and political parties who fear radiation dangers.

 Naxalite groups and NGOs working for tribals have also voiced their opposition, but the uranium corporation has cited several reports saying the unit will be safe.

 Clueless Congress gets the jitters

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, March 29: When BJP spokesman Prakash Javadekar accused the Centre of its abject failure to project its case of social backwardness in the right perspective before the Supreme Court, quite a few OBC members of Parliament in the UPA privately agreed with him.

 The Congresss heart was never fully with the OBC quota. It was a divided house. Its leaders were either bent on fixing Arjun Singh (HRD minister) for personal reasons or its upper caste ministers were determined to scupper the quota. Otherwise, why didnt it present the facts properly? asked a Rajya Sabha MP of the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

 Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvis response would make the MPs observations sound plausible. This is an interim arrangement and if a better factual foundation is available, I am sure that can also be used. The court is not against the concept. It is against lack of database, he said.

 For the Congress, the inability to furnish appropriate data in court is only a small worry. Its leaders have more vexatious questions on their mind. Nobody knows so far what the Prime Ministers and Sonia Gandhis views on the issue are. What are Arjuns motives in carving out a separate OBC quota and are these above board? Of immediate importance is what effect the Supreme Court order will have on the Uttar Pradesh polls?

 Many in the party were upset when Arjun, playing the secular-social justice card, tried to fortify his position with support from the Left and pro-OBC allies like the RJD and the DMK. The Congress working committees never endorsed quotas separately.

 The most forthright comment (by the Congresss standards) came from its general secretary, Digvijay Singh. He questioned the rationale of todays order given the fact that the apex court had upheld the Mandal Commissions proposals in 1990. Singh suggested the government could go for a review petition and call an all-party meeting to drum up support for the quota.

 OBC groups have been relatively quiet. The convener of a forum of 140 OBC MPs, V. Hanumantha Rao, said there was no immediate plan to force the government to contest the interim order. 

 The Congresss Rajya Sabha member will urge the Prime Minister and the Congress chief to do something legally and constitutionally to ensure OBC students already admitted arent thrown out. The meeting is likely to take place before Parliament reconvenes.

 For the moment, there are more jitters for the Congress in Uttar Pradesh. A tentative assessment is that gains made from Rahul Gandhis road shows in which he tried to win urban, upper-class support would be lost to the BJP. 

 The BJP has more OBC leaders than we have. In Uttar Pradeshs local body elections, the upper castes felt the BJP was a bigger sympathiser of theirs than the Congress. We were seen as a villain because of reservations but never got a single OBC vote, rued Congresss Harikesh Bahadur.

 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Heads matter, so does legacy

 Like his 10 heads, claimants to Ravanas legacy are many. Last week, he found himself dragged on both sides of the fence the believers and the atheists on the same day.

 The rationalists led by Dravidian Movement activists organised a Ravana Leela, rather than the usual Ram Leela, where the Lanka king was praised for his courage in daring an Aryan king (Rama) by spiriting away Sita. 

 The antics were in play even when a biopic on the Dravidian Movement leader E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) opened in theatres across the state. At the screening in Erode, where Periyar was born, a Dravidar Kazhagam volunteer dressed like the leader rode to the theatre on a chariot driven by a Ravana lookalike. 

 Elsewhere in the state, the annual Brahmotsavam in Shiva temples culminated in a procession where the Lord and his consort Uma were taken around on a Ravana Vahanam, a chariot-mounted vehicle steered by the 10-headed king. Ravana was known to be an ardent Shiva devotee.

 In lock-up for pet murder

 This is one bite Raju Gawda isnt forgetting soon. The dosa vendor is in custody, not for selling unsafe food, but for stabbing a dog. Gawda claims the death was accidental, but the dogs adoptive parents lodged a complaint. 

 Snowy lived with Arleen and Ivan Creado in the couples Juhu bungalow. She used to come to play in our compound. We decided to keep her.

 That particular evening, I thought of taking her to the beach. I was about to step out when I heard her wails. I saw two stab wounds. I ran out to the balcony to see if someone was there, said Arleen.

 Arleen said she saw Gawda standing near the gate, trying to hide a knife. He was taken to the Juhu police station for interrogation. Gawda has admitted to the killing. We will send the knife for a fingerprint test, inspector Sunil G. Varude said. 

 Gawda faces charges under Section 11(L) of the prevention of cruelty to animals act.

 Gandhians slum clinic

 An NGO run by a Gandhian has joined hands with one of Delhis biggest industrial houses to start a free health clinic for residents of a slum in the citys Kalkaji area.

 Suman Agarwal, who teaches Gandhian philosophy at Delhi University, adopted the Sudhar Camp cluster of jhuggis years ago, but the lack of proper health facilities, particularly for women and children, worried her. 

 The Ansals, the construction group with a towering presence in Delhi, is now helping Agarwal build lives. Gandhiji called poverty the worst form of violence. It hurts the health of people like nothing else, said Agarwal. 

 Over 800 families live in the camp, but slum-dwellers from other localities can also avail of its facilities. 

 A retired paediatrician from the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital visits the camp each morning, while a gynaecologist is there twice a week. In the afternoon, the clinic turns into a vocational training centre.

 Power peg

 Electricity is in short supply in Mumbai, not power penalties.

 The Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) collected over Rs 136 lakh in fines during April, twice the Rs 60 lakh recovered during the same month last year.

 General manager Uttam Khobragade said higher penalties were the result of an organisational revamp. Earlier, the vigilance wing, responsible for curbing power theft, was with the supply wing and was suspected to be in connivance with the defaulters.

 Now, the department has been placed directly under Khobragades supervision. This has helped increase the revenue collection from free riders.

 Mumbai: The Guild Art Gallery presents a collection of works by various artists. The gallery is located at 28B Pipewala Building, 58-70, Shahid Bhagat Singh Road, Fourth Pasta Lane, Colaba. The event is on till May 31, from 10 am to 6 pm. For more information, call 22875839 and 22876211.

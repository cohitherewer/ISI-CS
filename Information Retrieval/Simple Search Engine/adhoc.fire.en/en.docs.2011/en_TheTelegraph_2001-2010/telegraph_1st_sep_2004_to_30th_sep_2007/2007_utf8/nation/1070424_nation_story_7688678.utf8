 Letter jolts Jessica judge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Shayan Munshi

 New Delhi, April 23: An anonymous letter claiming connivance between officials representing the prosecution and the accused in the Jessica Lal murder case has stunned Delhi High Court into deferring a crucial hearing. 

 Model-turned-actor Shayan Munshi and 18 other witnesses in the case, who turned hostile, will have to explain their changed stand on Friday. 

 While accepting written explanations of some hostile witnesses, the high court had in February found the statements of Munshi and the other 18 self-contradictory and had asked them to appear in court today. 

 Munshi, who is from Calcutta, turned up with wife Peeya, but Justice R.S. Sodhi, who had sentenced prime accused Manu Sharma to life in prison, was in no mood to hear him. 

 A letter that has come to us makes some shocking statements and allegations, he said, without clarifying the nature of its contents. 

 Court sources said the letter alleged that officials of the special investigation team (SIT) that probed the murder had deliberately weakened their arguments, helping Sharma escape the hangmans noose. It claimed there were three similar cases waiting for justice.

 The letter, which mentions a nexus between police officials, ballistic experts, defence lawyers and court staff, was handed by Justice Sodhi back to the same SIT. 

 I have handed over the letter to you. It is disturbing and I want you to investigate if there is any truth in the allegations, Sodhi told the SIT. 

 Sabrina Lal, Jessicas sister, called Justice Sodhis decision of handing the letter to the SIT ridiculous. You cant expect a criminal to indict himself. The investigation of the letter should have been handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation, she said. 

 Justice P.K. Bhasin will be with Sodhi on Friday when the hostile witnesses explain themselves. Bhasin and Sodhi had convicted Sharma.

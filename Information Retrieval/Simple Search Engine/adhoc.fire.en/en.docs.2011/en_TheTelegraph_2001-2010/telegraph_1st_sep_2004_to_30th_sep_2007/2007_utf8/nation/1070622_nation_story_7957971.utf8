 New Delhi, June 21: A.P.J. Abdul Kalam rode Indias missile success story to Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

 Today, near the end of his tenure as President, he was back where he came from on a platform handing over missiles to the military even as fireworks rage over his proposed re-contest for the top job in the country. 

 But Kalam has narrowed down, like the Brahmos missile he handed over to the army today, his circular error of probability (CEP). The smaller the CEP, the higher the chances the missile will hit the target. Kalam yesterday let it be known that he would contest on the assurance of victory. 

 The Brahmos was given to the army today on the assurance that it is a world-class product capable of finding its target every time. 

 Kalam has also set Brahmos-makers a new target a Mark II version of the missile that will be hypersonic. 

 The Brahmos, capable of flying at 2.8 times the speed of sound, is supersonic. Hypersonic capability would double that rate. He also said the Brahmos is a unique product that needs to be exported fast. 

 With such capability, I believe that we have to aggressively market this world-class product which will have a market shelf life of not more than five years, he said.

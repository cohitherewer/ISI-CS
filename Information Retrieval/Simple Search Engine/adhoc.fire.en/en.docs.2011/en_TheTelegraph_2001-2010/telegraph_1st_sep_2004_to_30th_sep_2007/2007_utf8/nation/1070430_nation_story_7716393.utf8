 Growth axe threatens Garden City tag

 Bangalore, April 29: Bangalore might cease to be the Garden City, the citys older sobriquet before Indias Silicon Valley eclipsed it. 

 Conservationists are alarmed at the felling of trees in the name of development. The threat comes from at least a dozen projects, including flyovers, underpasses, road-widening plans and railway projects. 

 Now, theres another on the list: the Metro rail. The elevated boulevard on M.G. Road is being razed to facilitate the construction of an overhead Metro station. 

 The city has been losing around 1,500 trees in each of the past five years. Many of them were 35 to 60 years old witnesses to the citys transition from being a pensioners paradise to an IT hotspot.

 Rohan DSouza from Hasiru Usiru (meaning green breath in Kannada), a citizens initiative to protect trees, says there has been a rapid depletion of greenery, especially in the past two years. 

 Lack of coordination between government departments is one reason. Because of pressure from citizens groups, the Bangalore City Corporation has appointed a nodal tree officer whose permission is required for cutting trees, says DSouza.

 The two-year-old NGO, which filed an application under the right to information act, was told that the corporation had permitted 1,200 trees to be axed in 2006. U. Krishna, the officer appointed by the corporation to oversee trees, concedes there is no other way but to cut trees if the large number of infrastructure projects are to take off.

 At the same time, he said, there are more restrictions in place. This month alone, we saved over 30 trees. In fact, in two road-widening projects, we have managed to change the alignment. As a result, we were able to save at least 50 per cent of the trees. 

 The Metro alone has put 1,500 trees on the chopping block. We have advised Metro that they have to compensate in a 1:10 ratio. For every tree cut, they have to plant 10 saplings. But DSouza, who fears the Metro will wipe out the green cover, says saplings are often not planted where the felling is carried out.

 The Malleswaram underpass has claimed 40 trees while 1,200 were chopped to widen the highway to Mysore. Local people say these were planted over 65 years ago. 

 Theres no point planting ornamental and imported trees, said Parmeswaran, one of the residents upset at the felling of leafy Asoka trees. Some say the new trees are uprooted easily by a strong gust. 

 Old-timers say one could see trees on both sides of the road forming a green canopy until five years ago in Basavanagudi, Malleswaram, Indiranagar and Koramangala. The trees, DSouza says, are also needed to absorb the emission from over 20 lakh vehicles.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Hop off Metro, get into a bus

 The Metro might have put Delhi on a fast lane. But not many are reaching their destinations on time. 

 The reason: buses in some parts of the capital are few and far between. 

 But this is all set to change with the Delhi government planning to introduce rural transport vehicles (RTVs) minibuses that can carry between 15 and 20 people in select zones. 

 The complaint of people is genuine. We cant have government buses everywhere. The fleet isnt big enough. And private buses wont ply to these areas. So we are engaging smaller contractors who run RTVs, a senior Delhi government official said. 

 The worst-affected areas in terms of absence of buses near upcoming Metro stations are Badarpur in the south-east and Dilshad Garden in west Delhi.

 Served up: a tax ace

 Sania Mirzas nose ring might have GeNext swooning, but it cant sway the municipality babus.

 The tennis star is among a bunch of sports personalities and filmstars from Andhra Pradesh who might have the taxmen knocking on their doors if they dont curb their endorsements. 

 Taking a cue from the Mumbai corporation, which recently cracked the whip on Amitabh Bachchan, its Hyderabad counterpart has drawn up a list of names it includes Sanias who would be asked to pay service tax for featuring in ad campaigns. 

 The celebrities are minting gold in endorsements and, hence, should pay the service tax, municipal commissioner Sanjay Jaju said.

 Earlier, only the agencies that made the ad films and billboards had to pay the tax.

 Sania has a string of endorsements under her belt and, according to industry reports, pockets several crores a year.

 The other face thats pasted all over the city is that of actor Mahesh Babu, whose stocks rose after the superhit Pokiri. He reportedly did a Thums Up commercial for a whopping Rs 5 crore. 

 Actresses like Ilyana, Sneha and Anushka are regulars in textile and jewellery ads. 

 TV taxis for tourists

 The capital

 sure knows how to treat

 its guests. So, no more

 of the yellow-top black

 taxis, tourists will

 now get special vehicles.

 Their identification

 mark: TV (tourist vehicle)

 in the registration

 number.

 The department of road transport and highways has agreed, in principle, to allocate a fleet of these tourist vehicles, which are owned and operated by recognised tourist transport operators, officials said.

 The tourism ministry is also taking up with the Delhi government zonal tourist permits to give those travelling across states a smooth ride. 

 The move comes after a parliamentary committee expressed concern over taxes in the tourism sector.

 High and a multitude of central and state taxes create hurdles in packaging tourism products and make the product expensive as well, the committee said in a recent report. 

 However, there is no word yet on whether these TV taxis will have a particular colour scheme like their-yellow-and-black counterparts. 

 Stamp champ

 Tamil Nadu is intent on stamping its mark. Under the UPA regime, which will be completing 36 months in office, the state has released almost a stamp a month.

 From singers like M.S. Subbalakshmi to film producer S.S. Vasan to freedom fighters like Tirupur Kumaran, all have a stamp to their name. The list of legends also includes former Union industries minister Murasoli Maran.

 Tamil Nadu touched the milestone of 25 stamps thanks to Dayanidhi Maran, who was a DMK minister two days ago. The postal department fell under his IT and telecommunication portfolio.

 Cong stands by Arjun

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: The Centre is unlikely to agree to Mayavatis request for a CBI probe into the dowry harassment charge against Arjun Singh, official sources said.

 The Congress, which heads the central coalition, yesterday broke its silence on the controversy and came out in support of the human resource development minister.

 Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal, who is also a lawyer, said an allegation contained in a first information report cannot be referred to the CBI without proper investigation. In this case, the FIR is being used to besmirch his name, Sibal said.

 Arjuns granddaughter-in-law Priyanka had levelled the allegation against the minister and his family in a complaint lodged with Moradabad police earlier this week.

 Sources said the department of personnel and training will technically have to take a call on the Uttar Pradesh governments request.

 Arjun met the Prime Minister briefly today but details of the meeting were not known. The sources said the Congress had been mum the last two days because of the absence of a line from Sonia Gandhi, whose comfort level with Arjun has always been a bit uneven.

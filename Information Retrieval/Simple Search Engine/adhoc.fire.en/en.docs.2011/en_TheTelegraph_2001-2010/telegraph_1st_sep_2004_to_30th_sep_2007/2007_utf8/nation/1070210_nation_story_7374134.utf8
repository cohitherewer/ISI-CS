 Delhi, Bangla bond

 Fakhruddin Ahmed

New Delhi, Feb. 9: The Bangladesh Army may well be running the country with kid gloves on, but the story so far is that India is fully on board with the caretaker government of chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and is inviting him to the Saarc summit in Delhi on April 2-3.

 External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, who has been on a whirlwind tour of South Asia for the last couple of weeks to invite heads of state and government to the summit, will be going at the end of the month to Dhaka to invite Fakhruddin Ahmed.

 The new caretaker government, which has received considerable appreciation from western powers like the US and the UK, is also said to have privately assured New Delhi that it will repair the damage that has been recently done in the bilateral relationship.

 Iftikhar Ahmed Chaudhury, the foreign affairs adviser, is also believed to have sent a message saying that Dhaka was not averse to taking action against Indian extremist groups, which were being sheltered by Khaleda Zias BNP government for the last few years.

 New Delhis comfort level with Fakhruddin Ahmed may also stem from the fact that he, like Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, is also an internationally renowned economist. He was with the World Bank for many years and for the last few has been the head of the Bangladesh Central Bank.

 A triumvirate of economists are now going to preside over South Asia, giving the region unprecedented opportunity to forge fresh bonds, a diplomat said.

 Aziz has already accepted Indias invitation to the Saarc summit.

 Fakhruddin Ahmeds choice of technocrat advisers Iftikhar Chaudhury is a former high commissioner to India, for example has also come in for considerable international appreciation. But one of the men Fakhruddin Ahmed wanted, an IT specialist called Faiz Khan, had to be dropped because he was found to also have an American passport.

 New Delhi has been keeping a sharp eye on developments in Bangladesh, applauding the fact that the new government has been taking some stern measures to stem the rot.

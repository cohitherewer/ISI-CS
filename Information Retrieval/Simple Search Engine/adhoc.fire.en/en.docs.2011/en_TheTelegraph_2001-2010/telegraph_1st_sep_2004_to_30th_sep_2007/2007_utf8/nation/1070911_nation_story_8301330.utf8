 Spurned lover hits back

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: A young man walked into his friends house, whipped out a pistol and shot her and her mother late last night, apparently after they turned down his marriage proposal.

 Jagat Shokeen, 27, then sped away on his bike, police said.

 Niti Arora, 24, and her mother Asha, 45, have been admitted to a hospital. Both are said to be critical.

 The details of what really happened will emerge only after we speak to the two women, said a police officer. 

 Police sources said Niti, who works in an IT firm, may have met Jagat at work. They had known each other for a while, so it was usual for him to come to their house, an officer said.

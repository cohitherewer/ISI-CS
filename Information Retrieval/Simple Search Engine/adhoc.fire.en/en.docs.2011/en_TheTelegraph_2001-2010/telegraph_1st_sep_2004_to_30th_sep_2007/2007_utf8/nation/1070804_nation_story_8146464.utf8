 Bags packed for Mission Arctic

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: His bags packed with sterilised bottles, biologist Sisynthy Shivaji will fly tonight on a journey to Ny Alesund, a scientific outpost on Spitsbergen island, 1,230km from the North Pole, as part of Indias first science expedition to the Arctic.

 In the bottles, he hopes to bring back some exotic Arctic bacteria.

 More than a quarter of a century after India began its yearly Antarctic expeditions, the ministry of earth sciences today launched what it hopes will be the first of a series of research missions to the Arctic zone. 

 Five Indian scientists will travel to Ny Alesund on Norways Spitsbergen island for periods ranging from two to four weeks during which they will study Arctic ice, rocks and atmosphere, and explore Arctic microbial communities. 

 India will make use of logistics and a research station set up by Norway. The expedition follows several months of discussions between Indian and Norwegian officials as well as ministerial talks for possible collaboration in polar science. 

 The first summer expedition in August-September this year is likely to be followed by a second winter mission in February 2008 that may have up to 10 members. India is spending about Rs 1 crore on the two expeditions.

 Shivaji, a scientist from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, believes the Arctic harbours exotic bacteria that may find use in the biotechnology industry. 

 Exotic bacteria have been shown to have some real-world applications. Indian defence scientists, for instance, have harnessed cold-tolerant bacteria to decompose human waste on the Siachen Glacier. 

 The hope is that bacteria from such extreme cold environment may find application in industrial biotechnology, said Shivaji. 

 Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said the Arctic expeditions would complement Indias science on Antarctica. 

 The ministry of earth sciences has proposed expeditions to Spitsbergen island between 2007 and 2009, to be followed by full-fledged oceanographic expeditions to the Arctic in a research vessel during the summers of 2009-10, and 2011-12.

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Cubs steal show, zoo reaps gains

 The turnstiles are ringing at Delhi zoo, with sales tripling since four eight-month-old quadruplet white tigers were put on public display. 

 Our sales were below average this year. But since March 1, when these four cubs were put on display, children have been thronging the zoo, Mahendra Singh, curator of Delhis National Zoological Park, said. 

 Authorities name tiger cubs only after they turn a year old many dont survive the critical early period so the four are nameless, but their mother Jamuna apparently does all she can to make sure they arent neglected in any way. 

 All the keepers love Jamuna. And she knows that. Sometimes, she howls to make sure we come and check up on her cubs, director D.N. Singh said. Jamuna and her cubs are in the same enclosure. 

 On February 3, three other white tiger cubs were born here to tiger Suraj and tigress Kaveri both three-year-olds. 

 The newborns, kept in a temperature-controlled environment, feed on their mothers milk. Cubs here are given meat chicken to start with six months after birth.

 Yoga makes big strides

 Patanjalis Yoga Sutra has found a new convert Tamil Nadu. It doesnt matter that the book is written in Sanskrit, a legacy that the state isnt known to be too fond of.

 The ideological somersault was evident at an event last week. Speaker after speaker at a seminar organised by the Tamil Nadu Physical Education and Sports University extolled the virtues of the ancient practice. The biggest advertisement was that chief minister M. Karunanidhi has a 30-minute yoga session each morning.

 Yoga guru Rishi Paranjothiyar thanked the university for setting up a department dedicated to the subject. C.K. Gariyali, secretary to the governor, said the study of yoga isnt confined to a particular religion. 

 Unlike Madhya Pradesh, which got sullied in the surya namaskar row, Tamil Nadu has come out shining, managing to give yoga a secular halo.

 Pampered on wheels

 Water supply, roads, transport and sanitation these are not the basic amenities many civic authorities can guarantee citizens. But when it comes to pampering themselves, there appear to be no strings attached or no brakes.

 Earlier this week, a high court bench asked the government to file an affidavit on how three officials of a corporation near Pune could buy themselves a Skoda and two Corollas. They even had beacons atop the sedans.

 The petitioners said the officials, including the mayor, of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation were violating a government limit on purchase of public vehicles apparently set at Rs 6 lakh.

 The government said it couldnt do much, other than deduct the excess amount from salaries. The offences committed by the trio arent criminal and they cant be prosecuted, state urban development secretary Jairaj Pathak told the judges.

 Sari shield

 Kanchi silk saris will soon carry a special logo certifying their authenticity as part of a Tamil Nadu government move to protect the interests of traditional weavers.

 With the industry threatened by fakes, the geographical indication act, which ensures patent rights and the logo, should go a long way in protecting the industry. Under an act passed by the Assembly last year, weavers will be registered with the handloom department. 

 The registration process will be over in a month. This is great relief to 50,000 weavers and silk manufacturers. This is one of our long-pending demands to protect the world-famous industry, said Kanchi Silk Manufacturers Association president Y. M. Narayanasamy.

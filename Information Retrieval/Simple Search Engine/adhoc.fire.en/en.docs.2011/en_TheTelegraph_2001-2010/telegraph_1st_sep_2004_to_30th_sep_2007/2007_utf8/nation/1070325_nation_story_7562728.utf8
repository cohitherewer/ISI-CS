The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 A lecture amp; a joke, from Lalu

 Lalu Prasad

 New Delhi, March 24 (PTI): Indias show at the World Cup has not incensed only fans on the street. Lalu Prasad is fuming, too. 

 The railway minister blamed the poorly performing senior cricketers for the loss to Sri Lanka. They (senior players) should be removed and young players should be brought in, he said. 

 Like many upset fans, Lalu Prasad also sees a lot wrong with the endorsements that players make. Their advertisements should be stopped. That is the main problem. They are only interested in earning money.

 Then, he put in a little joke. I think I could have played better than them (senior players).

 Lalu Prasad did not spare the master blaster or the selectors, though. In what seemed a dig at Sachin Tendulkar, he said top players were getting out for duck. He also questioned the wisdom of excluding middle-order batsman Mohammad Kaif from the squad.

 The BJP was also ready with its lecture. Our team should be a bit more serious about cricket as it is a passion in our country, vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said. But fans, too, should take it as a game and not as an addiction.

 Das Munshi appeal

 I amp;B minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi requested fans to exercise restraint. In real sportsman spirit, we should not make any demonstration before houses of the players or harass their families.

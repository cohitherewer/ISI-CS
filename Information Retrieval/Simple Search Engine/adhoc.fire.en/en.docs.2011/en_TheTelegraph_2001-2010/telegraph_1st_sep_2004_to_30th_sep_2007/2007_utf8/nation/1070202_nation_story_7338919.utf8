 Village elders chop lovers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Feb. 1: Meeruts Gudiya died of trauma a year ago after a panchayat decided which of her husbands she should live with.

 Agras Gudiya was chopped to pieces yesterday after a panchayat sentenced her to death for daring to choose her life partner.

 Nineteen-year-old Gudiya and her physically challenged boyfriend, Mahesh Singh, had been dragged back to their village, Nehra, two days after they had eloped and two days before they would have married. The panchayats verdict was as chilling as the 2 am air: Kill them both.

 Mother Rajamala wasnt allowed to speak and Gudiyas two younger brothers were locked up in a room. Her father had died five years ago and the family lived with her uncle Jogesh Singh.

 The village elders got drunk before they hacked the lovers into pieces. The body parts were burnt near a drain 1.5 km from the village. It was an honour killing. The villagers decided the relationship was incestuous as the couple were from the same gotra (clan), said senior superintendent of police (rural) Vinay Yadav.

 The couple had slipped out of Nehra in the small hours of Monday and taken shelter with one of Maheshs uncles in Bandipur, 32 km away, where they planned to marry on Friday. Mahesh, despite a twisted leg, was a competent carpenter and quite capable of looking after Gudiya. It took Jogesh and his relatives just a day to find the couple.

 The floors of Chauhan Bhavan, where panchayat meetings are held in Nehra, 55 km from Agra, had not been cleaned of the bloodstains when the police arrived yesterday, SSP Yadav said. Fragments of the couples clothes and their blood samples have been collected.

 Honour killings are common in the states western districts of Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur and Bijnor. Agra, home to the worlds most famous monument to love, got onto the map six months ago, courtesy a horror in Garhi Rathore village. In Muzaffarnagar, 22 couples were killed in 2003 and 16 in 2005.

 Many officials from the region appear to condone the practice. One of Indias top farmers leaders had said: If you violate community traditions, you deserve this.

 A police officer in Muzaffarnagar said: I wont be waiting with roses for my daughter if she elopes. She will face guns, too.

 Kiss that broke a heart

 MANDIRA NAYAR 

 Zeenat Aman and Dev Anand 

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: Dev Anand was a star, Zeenat Aman the newly crowned Miss Asia and the ultimate pin-up girl. He launched her, only to lose Zeenie just when he was about to confess his love to her.

 My heart broke into pieces, Anand writes in his autobiography Romancing with Life, released by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today. 

 After the premiere of Ishq Ishq Ishq at Metro Cinema, Raj Kapoor kissed Zeenat in full view of the invited audience, congratulating her for her sparkling performance.

 Anand says he was jealous of him for making advances on what I considered my sole possession, my discovery, my leading lady. But the filmmaker, who turned 84 today, adds he was proud of Zeenie Baby and admired Raj Kapoor for his honest and spontaneous reaction. 

 Discovering that he was desperately in love with Zeenat, he had set up a romantic evening to make an honest confession. I called her up to say, Zeenie, I want to go out on a date with you tonight. 

 But the filmi twist at a party they were to attend before the date changed everything. 

 The first person who greeted Zeenat from a distance was a drunken Raj Kapoor. He threw his arms around her exuberantly. This suddenly struck me as a little too familiar. And the way she reciprocated his embrace seemed much more than just polite and courteous. 

 Raj Kapoor grasped his hand with a very tight grip, like never before, as if trying to make amends for some wrong. 

 However, the incident forced him to say goodbye to the relationship which, though it had been non-committal emotionally on both sides, had been honest all the same. 

 The painting I had made of her started showing signs of cracking, Anand writes.

 Not down for too long, Anand picked up the pieces of his broken heart swiftly and went back to work. His next find was Tina Munim, a young girl who had come to him for his autograph and ended up as the janeman of Des Pardes. 

 Having Tina next to you was as good as having a sparkling glass of wine being offered to you. She was naughty, mischievous and frivolous, a cute girl that everyone was fond of, he writes.

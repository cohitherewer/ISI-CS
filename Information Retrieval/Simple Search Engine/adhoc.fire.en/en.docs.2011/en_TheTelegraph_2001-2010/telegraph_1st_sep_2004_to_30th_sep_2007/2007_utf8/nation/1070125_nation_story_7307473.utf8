 Mangroves can be cut: HC

 Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court on Wednesday allowed the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai to cut mangroves in Mahul Creek area in northeast Mumbai to expand the creek.

 The civic body had asked for a modification of the high courts earlier order which had banned cutting down mangroves in the state.

 The body had said it might have to cut down mangroves in an area of 93,000 sq m. The high court had said that mangroves could be cut down only wherever necessary. The corporation contended that expansion of the creek was necessary in line with recommendations of the Madhav Chitaley committee report. The report had said expansion of the creek was necessary to avoid floods, like the one in July 2005.

 Bombay Environment Action Group had filed a PIL against the destruction of mangroves.

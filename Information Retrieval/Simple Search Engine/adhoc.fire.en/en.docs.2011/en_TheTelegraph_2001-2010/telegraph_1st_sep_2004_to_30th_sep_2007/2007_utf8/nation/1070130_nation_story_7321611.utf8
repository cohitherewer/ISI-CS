 Curfew after MP arrest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Jan. 29: Violent demonstrations in Gorakhpur in the wake of BJP MP Yogi Adityanaths arrest prompted the district administration to re-impose curfew in four police station areas today.

 Police also had to lathicharge the mob as it burnt down a bus and several other vehicles and tried to set a train on fire.

 The curfew had been first imposed when communal clashes broke out on Saturday night that killed one person. The BJP MP from Gorakhpur and 150 of his supporters were arrested for trying to ignite fresh trouble in the city, inspector-general V.K. Verma said.

 Adityanath has been sent to jail.

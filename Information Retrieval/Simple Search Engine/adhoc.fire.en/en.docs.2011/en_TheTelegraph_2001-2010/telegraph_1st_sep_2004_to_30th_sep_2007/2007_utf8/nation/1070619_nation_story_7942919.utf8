 Why not a lady? Ask Unni amp; Munni

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 

 Gender poser: NCERTs Unni and Munni

 New Delhi, June 18: Before Sonia Gandhi and Prakash Karat thought of gifting India a woman President, someone else had an inkling.

 A year before the tussle over presidential nominees began, and threw up the name of Pratibha Patil as the UPAs candidate, the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) had already given India a woman President. 

 The new Class IX political science textbook Democratic Politics deliberately refers to the President as she and her, while choosing to continue with the male equivalents for other posts such as the Prime Minister. 

 The President is not elected directly by the people. All the MPs, MLAs elect her. The President can never claim the kind of direct popular mandate that the PM can. This ensures that she remains only a nominal executive, the section titled The President in Chapter 5 of the book says.

 That the authors anticipate some reaction at least from students to the choice of gender for the President is apparent from the accompanying dialogue between Unni and Munni, two cartoon characters who frequently ask questions through the book.

 A puzzled Unni asks Munni: Why does this book refer to the President as she? Have we ever had a woman President in our country? 

 Munni promptly replies: Did you protest when the book referred to the Prime Minister (earlier in the chapter) as he? Have we not had a woman Prime Minister? Why should we assume that all important positions are held by men? 

 Officials at the human resource development ministry claim the deliberate use of the feminine gender to describe the President greatly impressed HRD minister Arjun Singh.

 Professor Yogendra Yadav, chief adviser for the political science textbooks, said the emergence of Patil as the presidential frontrunner was just a pleasant coincidence.

 The book was conceived and written last year when President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was in the running for a second term and Patil was holding forth in Jaipurs Raj Bhavan. 

 It is a pleasant coincidence, nothing more. What is not coincidence is the usage of the feminine to describe the President. But we had no clue that Munnis dream could come true so soon, Yadav said. 

 If Patil does go on to become President this July, the dialogue between Unni and Munni aimed at questioning male dominance in top constitutional posts wont be needed any more.

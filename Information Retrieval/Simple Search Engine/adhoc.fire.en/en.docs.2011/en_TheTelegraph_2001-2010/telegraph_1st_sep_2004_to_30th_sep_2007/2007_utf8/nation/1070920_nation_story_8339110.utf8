 Ambika: New York no-show

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: Ambika Soni has called off her visit to New York for the Incredible India at 60 show, conceived and executed by her to showcase India in the US.

 The cancellation came as the setu controversy claimed two lives in Bangalore in an arson attack on a bus. 

 Caught in a political storm over the Ram affidavit, Ambika has been waiting to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 She submitted some documents on the affidavit to the Prime Ministers Office on Saturday and is expected to decide whether she will quit or continue as minister after the meeting. The Prime Minister, who came home last evening after a surgery at AIIMS, did not meet anybody today. 

 A government statement said that since Ambika was not yet able to meet the Prime Minister, she has decided not to go to New York. 

 Tourism secretary Sheelbhadra Banerjee will represent the government at the US festival from September 23 to 26.

 A senior minister in touch with Ambika explained why she stayed back: She has a sword hanging over her head. She did a prudent thing by not going. It would have sent a wrong signal because her detractors would have said shes having a great time before her name is cleared. Unless she gets a positive direction from Sonia Gandhi, she will not change her mind.

 Congress sources said Sonia hasnt spoken to Ambika, 10 Janpaths one-time confidante, since they met last Saturday. But the Congress president was reportedly upset with the minister for being away from the capital when her ministry filed the Ram setu affidavit in the Supreme Court. 

 Ambika was in Tokyo when the controversy erupted. She told journalists Sonia had upbraided her when they spoke on the phone. 

 Ambika had almost micro-managed the India Incredible campaign. She got the Confederation of Indian Industry on board and consulted business leaders, such as Nandan Nilekani and Sunil Mittal, to organise the event.

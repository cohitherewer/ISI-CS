 Women spy male bias in tax term for judge post

 Mumbai, July 6 (PTI): A woman lawyer earning less than Rs 20,000 a month cannot become a district judge a petition in Bombay High Court has argued that this is the implication of the criterion devised by the law and judiciary department for the post.

 The law ministry had sought applications for a written test for the post of district judge two months ago. There were more than 1,000 applications, and a high court judges committee decided that only practising lawyers who had got at least 55 per cent marks in the LLB exam and those who pay income-tax would be eligible for writing the test.

 But a few women lawyers have challenged the decision as discriminatory. Their counsel Shrihari Aney told the high court on Wednesday a woman would have to earn much more than a man to be eligible.

 The reason is that the income-tax exemption limits for men and women are different. A man earning up to Rs 1.1 lakh a year is exempt from paying income-tax. For a woman, the limit is Rs 1.45 lakh.

 If a man has an income of about Rs 1,99,000 per annum, with proper investments, he is not required to pay income-tax, Aney said. For a woman, the corresponding figure would be Rs 2,34,000 (around Rs 19,500 a month).

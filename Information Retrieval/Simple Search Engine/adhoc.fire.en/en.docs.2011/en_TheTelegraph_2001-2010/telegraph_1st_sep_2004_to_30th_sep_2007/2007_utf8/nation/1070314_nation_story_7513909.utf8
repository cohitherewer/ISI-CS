 BSP in upper caste gamble

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Lucknow, March 13: Mayavati today handed Brahmins the largest number of tickets after the backward castes for next months elections in an attempt to boost her vote share.

 On the list of 403 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidates released here today, 139 are from the upper castes, 86 of them Brahmins. Other backward classes have been given 110 tickets, Scheduled Castes 93 and Muslims 61. Thakurs, a group the rival Samajwadi Party courts aggressively, have got a patchy representation, landing only 36 tickets.

 Mayavati has decided not to contest herself, saying she would like to devote her energy to campaigning. But sources say the BSP boss, now a Rajya Sabha member, doesnt want to lose the seat before the election outcome is clear. 

 Claiming shes the only star campaigner for her party, she says: I dont have any film stars to do my job. The reference is to Amitabh Bachchans spiel for Mulayam Singh Yadav and the bevy of stars in other parties like the BJP.

 In the 2002 Assembly elections, the BSP had fielded 92 upper castes, of which only 26 were Brahmins (six of them were elected). In the 2004 Lok Sabha polls, one of the six Brahmins given a ticket won. 

 We are trying to get a majority and the ticket distribution shows that we want all castes to be with us, Mayavati said, adding that the focus was shifting from bahujan to sarvajan. Sources said the BSP boss realises that even after all Dalits rallied behind her, the BSPs vote-share hasnt improved from the 21 per cent in the 2002 elections.

 This has been the experience for us during the last few polls, said a party insider, adding that the party of the bahujans had started hitting a plateau. Over the years, the BSP followed an approach that excluded many sections of voters, but Mayavati now feels it must reach out wider.

 Political representation according to the numerical strength of castes, the BSP boss said, summing up her new strategy.

 Brahmins make up 11 per cent of Uttar Pradeshs voters, but their political clout has diminished ever since the Congress and the BJP began to lose their grip on the state.

 A party leader denied that Mayavati is courting the upper castes at the expense of her traditional voters. 

 This never happened. Our own base, comprising Jatavs and other groups, has never deserted us, she said.

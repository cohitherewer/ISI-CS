 BPO hand in lethal ride

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 18: A speeding Santro allegedly driven by a drunk call centre employee ran into a family of six, killing two children and critically wounding the others today. 

 The car at a speed of over 120 km per hour climbed onto a pavement and rammed into the six who were sitting and waiting for an auto-rickshaw, police said. 

 Darpan, the person behind the wheel, apparently lost control while trying to avoid a metre-wide pothole early in the morning. 

 The police said Darpan, who lives in Janakpuri, was returning home from Faridabad along the Mehrauli-Faridabad state highway when he ran over the family outside south Delhis Sangam Vihar. The road is full of potholes and has poor lighting. 

 Darpan did not flee the spot after the crash, a factor that could go in his favour once legal proceedings begin. 

 He has been arrested and an FIR lodged against him. The FIR mentions charges under Section 297 (rash driving) and Section 304 (causing death by negligence).

 Tests have confirmed that the alcohol content in his body was above permissible limits. 

 The injured were taken by the police to All India Institute of Medical Sciences, where Ankit, 3, and Sonu, 6 were declared dead on arrival. Their sister, Anu, 1, parents Suman and Lal Chand and uncle Som Vir are battling for life. 

 The family residents of Sangam Vihar were returning home after visiting a relative in Agra. 

 They had arrived at the inter-state bus terminal and taken an auto-rickshaw home. The auto driver, however, refused to enter Sangam Vihar. 

 Since they had luggage, the family were waiting for another auto perhaps someone who lived in Sangam Vihar to take them inside, a police officer said.

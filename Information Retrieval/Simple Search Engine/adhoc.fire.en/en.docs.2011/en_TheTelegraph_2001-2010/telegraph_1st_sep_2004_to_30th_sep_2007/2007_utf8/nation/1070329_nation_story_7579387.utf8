 Frown at info gap, not firing

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, March 28: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee need not worry about a rap on the knuckles over the March 14 firing when the CPM brass meets in Delhi on Saturday.

 But, at the politburo and central committee meetings, the Bengal chief minister may be faulted for his governments failure in communicating with the people of Nandigram.

 The party has already accepted that the police firing, though regrettable, was necessary to liberate the area from the grip of hostile political groups who had driven CPM supporters out of their homes.

 At worst, Bhattacharjee will be ticked off for the absence of a strong campaign that would have eased the hostilities and allay farmers fear of losing their land. But even on this count, the CPM leadership has noted that the state government had unsuccessfully tried to draw the Trinamul Congress into a dialogue.

 Bhattacharjees predecessor Jyoti Basu has, however, indicated that the chief minister had taken things for granted and failed to communicate with those who were to be affected by the industrialisation project. 

 In an interview to party mouthpiece Ganashakti, Basu said Bhattacharjee should have educated the people on the need for industrialisation. He added, though, that the chief minister had not expected this level of resistance.

 CPM general secretary Prakash Karat has laid down the line that is likely to be repeated at the politburo and central committee meetings.

 One, industrialisation will go on. Two, special economic zones will come up after the Centre amends the guidelines. And three, the CPM will foil all the ploys of its Left and Right adversaries as it has always done.

 The party has placed the responsibility for the Nandigram massacre on the state police even though the CBI has indicated the involvement of CPM cadre. The party brass may take the subject up but its anybodys guess how seriously the leaders will discuss it.

 All those who want the Left Front government to give up its industrialisation policy will be disappointed. West Bengal will protect and further develop agriculture, Karat wrote in a recent article in party organ Peoples Democracy.

 The long years of de-industrialisation have to be reversed. (The) CPM does not agree with those who argue that small and medium industries are sufficient. Large-scale units, particularly in manufacturing, are necessary. 

 It was Basu who, more than a decade ago, had launched a new industrial policy in Bengal hoping to breathe new life into the sector.

 Thieves tear up priceless pages

 FARHANA KALAM 

 Gaya, June 14: The Mughal emperor is said to have earned his daily bread by copying in his own hand literary masterpieces.

 More than 300 years later, a band of thieves thought theyd hit the jackpot of their lives Rs 50 lakh for a manuscript Aurangzeb had penned.

 Only, it proved to be a trap.

 A Gaya police team, disguised as customers, today recovered 19 pages of the 110-page Gulistan copied by the emperor from the original work authored by Iranian philosopher-saint Sheikh Saadi.

 The manuscript had been stolen about six months ago from the principals chamber at Tekari Raj High School.

 District police chief Amit Jain said three persons have been arrested in connection with the theft, suspected to have been masterminded by Jyoti, a former student.

 A hunt is on to catch Jyoti.

 The manuscript, one of the calligraphic efforts of Aurangzeb who some historians say earned his meal by copying the Quran and other masterpieces, had been gifted to the school by a Gaya landlord more than 100 years ago.

 It had been kept in a special locker, which was prised open by expert locksmiths.

 Jain said the thieves were negotiating the sale of the manuscript with a Calcutta-based antique dealer who had offered them Rs 20 lakh.

 When the police were tipped off about the deal, a decoy team offered Rs 50 lakh. The deal was to be finalised in a Gaya hotel.

 As soon as Bajrangi Singh, the man negotiating the deal, reached the hotel, he was overpowered by the sleuths.

 Bajrangi, who has earlier been to jail on charges of theft, led the police to where the Gulistan pages were kept.

 Besides the 19 pages, the books cover has been recovered, Jain said.

 Police sources said after the manuscript was stolen, the thieves quarrelled among themselves.

 They later tore up the manuscript into four or five parts and tried to sell them separately.

 When they failed to find buyers for the mutilated parts, they agreed to negotiate together for the 110 pages.

 The police said Bajrangi and one of his accomplices led the sleuths to a jeweller, who had escorted the thieves to Hyderabad to negotiate with an antique dealer.

 But the deal did not materialise.

 They also disclosed that the Calcutta-based dealer had offered them Rs 20 lakh.

 Despite the breakthrough, the police havent yet found the remaining 90-odd pages.

 Jain, however, said it is unlikely that the thieves still at large would destroy these pages out of panic.

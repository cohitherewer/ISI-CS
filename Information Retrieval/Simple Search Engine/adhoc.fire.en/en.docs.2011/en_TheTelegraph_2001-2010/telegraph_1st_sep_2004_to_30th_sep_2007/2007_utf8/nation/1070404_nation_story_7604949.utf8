 Centre clears tainted air

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 3: The Centre today told the Supreme Court that there is no convention of ministers resigning after being chargesheeted in a criminal case. 

 Solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati said while there were instances of accused ministers resigning, this had, in no way, become a convention. It wasnt even a question of law. 

 It was for Parliament to declare what a convention exactly is, he said during the hearing of a public interest litigation filed against appointment of people with criminal antecedents as ministers.

 On the lack of uniform standards, amicus curiae Rakesh Diwedi pointed out that a chief minister had resigned after being chargesheeted, but later went on to get a cabinet berth at the Centre. 

 Diwedi said one of the several issues that must be decided was the question of whether the President could even administer the oath of office to a person with criminal antecedents. 

 However, solicitor-general Vahanvati said a Constitution bench had already taken up the matter.

 The Centre has been requesting the court to dismiss the public interest litigation filed by Manoj Narula. The government contends that the matter essentially falls within the domain of Parliament and that there is no scope for judicial interference in the issue.

 Narulas petition had been disposed of by the apex court earlier after the Centre filed an affidavit saying the issue would be debated in Parliament. 

 Narula, who has been seeking the removal of tainted ministers, including railway minister Lalu Prasad, moved the court again after no such debate took place in the House.

 Pay for hostesses in weight tussle 

 New Delhi, March 27 (PTI): Delhi High Court has directed national carrier Indian to pay salary to air hostesses who were grounded for being overweight.

 The court gave interim relief to the aggrieved air hostesses but said the order was subject to the outcome of its final judgment.

 The order was passed by a bench of Chief Justice M.K. Sharma and Justice Sanjeev Khanna on an appeal by the state-owned airline against a ruling of a single-judge bench asking it to pay the salaries to the grounded air hostesses.

 The air hostesses had challenged Indians circular of May 4, 2006, withdrawing the permissible overweight limit of 3 kg as laid down for air hostesses.

 Arvind Sharma, counsel for the air hostesses, contended that the circular arbitrarily, unilaterally, illegally and without application of mind did away with the 3-kg limit and grounded them without pay.

 The petitioners, who have to undergo a medical check-up as prescribed under the Indian Airlines Services Employees Service Regulations, got all the clearance certificates and none of them was medically unfit to fly, Sharma said.

 The counsel contended that the air hostesses could not be grounded for not conforming to weight or height specifications once they have obtained the medical certificates.

 The qualification required under the rules was that air hostesses should be medically fit and nowhere was it mentioned that being overweight would attract grounding without pay, he argued.

 The circular did not have any legal sanctity and was aimed at throwing out permanent senior air hostesses from the services of the company (Indian), the petition said.

 In 1990, air hostesses were granted a grace of more than 10 per cent above the required height and weight limits but this was withdrawn in 2001.

 The petitioners, who sought quashing of the airlines circular withdrawing the 3-kg grace, also sought a directive to the airlines to allow them to do flying services by implementing the 10 per cent grace applicable in 1990.

 They have further sought a directive to the company to pay salary, perks and allowances for the period when they were grounded without pay.

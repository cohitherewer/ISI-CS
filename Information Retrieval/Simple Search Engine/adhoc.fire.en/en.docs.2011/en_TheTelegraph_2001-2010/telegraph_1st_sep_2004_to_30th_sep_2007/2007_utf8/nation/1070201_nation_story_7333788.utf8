 Result leak row in AIIMS

 New Delhi, Jan. 31 (PTI): A group of students today laid siege to AIIMS director P. Venugopals residence over the issue of re-examination of students who had failed. 

 The problem started yesterday when even before the results were officially declared posters surfaced on the AIIMS campus saying that some students, mostly belonging to the pro-reservation group, had failed to clear the re-examination conducted for unsuccessful candidates of the final tests.

 The protesters demanded an explanation on how the results were leaked. They also gunned for the scalp of the dean, examinations, T.D. Dogra, for allegedly leaking the results and demanded that the re-examination be conducted under a different set of examiners as the governing body of AIIMS had ordered.

 After the overnight vigil, we finally met the director this afternoon. They told us that the students had failed and had no plausible answers to how the posters came up or who had put them up, said R.K. Prasad, a spokesperson for the Progressive Medicos and Scientists Forum.

 According to Shakti Gupta, AIIMS spokesman, seven students had taken the exam and only one passed.

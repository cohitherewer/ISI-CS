 Net solutions for pensioners

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, March 31: Retired central government employees facing problems regarding pension no longer have to run from pillar to post to seek redress. They can find solutions to their pension problems on the Net.

 Or that is what the government has promised by launching a portal for central government pensioners.

 Minister of state for personnel, public grievances and pension Suresh Pachauri inaugurated the portal pensionersportal.gov.in yesterday.

 The portal would benefit over 38 lakh pensioners except employees who retired from the ministries of railways and defence. It will not include pension matters of staff who joined on or after January 1, 2004, and those handled by the ministry of finance under the new pension scheme.

 One can look up the portal for pension schemes and rules, circulars, forms for applications and claims, welfare measures, pension and EMI calculator, commutation tables and enquiries on the status of payment orders.

 The portal will redress grievances of pensioners in a time-bound manner. It has evolved through a series of discussions and consultations with various stakeholders, including pensioners, pensioners associations and various ministries and departments, said Pachauri.

 It will streamline the pension sanctioning process in central departments and ministries and promote transparency, accountability and promptness in the system, thereby ensuring correct and timely disposal of pension-related matters, said a senior official.

 The portal will have non-interactive and interactive components. The non-interactive part will comprise updated information on pension rules, instructions issued under these rules and a database on pensioners. The interactive part will involve registration of grievances and their redress.

 The system would function across various ministries, departments and organisations of the Centre and provide links to relevant databases.

 It would also allow the department of pension and pensioners welfare to play a nodal role in monitoring efficient running of the system, said a senior official. 

 The system will help identify areas of pension rules and departments which account for abnormal number of grievances and, in turn, speed up their redress, the official said.

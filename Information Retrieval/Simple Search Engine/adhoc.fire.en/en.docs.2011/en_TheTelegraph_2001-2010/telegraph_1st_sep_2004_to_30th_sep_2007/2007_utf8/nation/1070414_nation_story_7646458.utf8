 Missing photos bail out hit-and-run driver

 Mumbai, April 13: A police photographer who forgot his specs helped a businessmans son get away today with six months for running over 15 pavement sleepers, killing seven.

 The Bandra hit-and-run involving a well-to-do accused was to be a test for Mumbai police after they had failed to make the charge of culpable homicide stick against actor Salman Khan in a similar case.

 But the police photographer said the pictures produced in court of the site where Alistair Pareira, 21, lost control of his Toyota Corolla on November 12 last year werent the ones he had clicked.

 He insisted the seven photographs didnt match any of the 33 negatives he took. Although he then admitted to having left his glasses behind, throwing doubt on his testimony, the prosecution never got him back on the stand. The defence simply argued the pictures werent of the site at all.

 Pareira, returning from a party with friends, was allegedly drunk at the wheel. But the police failed to furnish medical evidence despite having collected blood and urine samples immediately after the incident.

 The additional sessions judge slammed the casually done investigation, saying the evidence didnt allow him to nail the engineering student for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which provides for a 10-year sentence.

 He gave the accused six months simple imprisonment for rash driving and 15 days for endangering lives, the sentences running concurrently. The one month he has spent in custody will be deducted.

 Pareira must also pay a fine of Rs 5 lakh, to be distributed among relatives of the victims, who included a pregnant woman and two children.

 The police needed to prove that Pareira realised the danger he was posing to others by speeding in a drunken state. A transport official found no mechanical defect in the car thus strengthening the charge of speeding but added his findings were inconclusive.

 The day after the tragedy, the local councillor, known to be close to the local MLA and state food and civil supplies minister, had visited the Pareira home.

 I am disappointed, said Manish Mashelkar, whose grandmother was run over and killed by a Ford Ikon driven by Ravindra Mhatre, Bal Thackerays personal assistant, in March 2005.

 The police refused to charge Mhatre with culpable homicide as they initially did with Salman after he ran over five pavement sleepers in 2002, killing one. Public pressure, however, later forced the charge to be laid against the actor. Salman challenged the charge in high court and got it dropped for lack of evidence.

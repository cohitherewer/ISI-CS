 9 passports to bomber

 London, March 20 (PTI): Dhiren Barot, an Indian-origin man who plotted to use a radioactive dirty bomb here, was issued nine British passports, home secretary John Reid admitted today.

 Seven of these were issued in his own name.

 Thirty-four-year-old Barot from Kingsbury, north-west London, was convicted last year of conspiring to murder civilians in the city by blowing up gas cylinders and detonating a dirty bomb. 

 He is now serving a 40-year sentence.

 The home office was recently forced to admit that up to 10,000 people had managed to obtain British passports by deception last year.

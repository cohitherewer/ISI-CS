 Amar sorry

 Mumbai, July 16 (PTI): Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh today apologised for the fracas his securitymen had with reporters and photographers at the Abhishek Bachchan-Aishwarya Rai wedding.

 What happened was unfortunate. I do not support it, he told a news confer- ence boycotted by photographers. However, the media should also exercise restraint.

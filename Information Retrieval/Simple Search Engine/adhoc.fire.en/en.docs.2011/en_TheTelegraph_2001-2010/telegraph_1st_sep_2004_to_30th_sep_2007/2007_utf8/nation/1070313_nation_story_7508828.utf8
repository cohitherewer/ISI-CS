 Arjun bill seesaws between Centre amp; states

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 12: Human resource development minister Arjun Singh has shot down the National Knowledge Commissions request to revive the central legislation affirming the right to education. 

 Faced with opposition from the finance ministry and the Planning Commission, the Centre had abandoned the legislation and prepared a model bill that states were asked to adopt. 

 This meant the Centre could wriggle out of its responsibility by putting the onus on the states, which are also loath to take up the task on the ground that they do not have the financial wherewithal. 

 Now, Manmohan Singh has to intervene. The Prime Minister is expected to chair a meeting of chief ministers to try and persuade them to adopt the model bill. The Centre and the states are likely to work out a financial arrangement so that they share the expenses. 

 In its report to the Prime Minister, the Knowledge Commission said: A model bill sent to the states is not enough to meet the constitutional responsibilities of the Government of India. A central legislation should be enacted along the lines of the Panchayati Raj (Amendment) Act requiring the states to enact the right to education bill within a specified time period.

 Arjun, however, is not relenting. The HRD ministry is required to prepare a cabinet note on the model bill. The cabinet will then have to approve it. 

 But last week, the HRD minister said: It has been left to the state governments to adopt the model bill prepared by the Centre.

 What grounded the central legislation was dogged opposition from the finance ministry and the Planning Commission. They were unwilling to sanction the financial requirements an additional Rs 53,000 crore needed annually to meet the parameters. 

 The finance ministry and the Planning Commission argued that over 95 per cent of children are already in schools under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. So, a greater part of what the legislation aims putting all children in the 6-14 age group in schools has been achieved.

 But the advocates of the central legislation are not giving up. The bill, they say, is a useful instrument for building schools in every neighbourhood and ensuring the employment of qualified teachers.

 The model bill has been criticised on various grounds. One of the drawbacks is that the bill places the responsibility of putting a child in school on the parents.

 Any right, including the right to education, is only meaningful if it is justiciable. The example of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act could be used in this context, the commission said.

 The advocates of the legislation also reject the argument of lack of finances as the central coalitions common minimum programme assures 6 per cent of the GDP for education. The government has also levied a 2 per cent cess for elementary education.

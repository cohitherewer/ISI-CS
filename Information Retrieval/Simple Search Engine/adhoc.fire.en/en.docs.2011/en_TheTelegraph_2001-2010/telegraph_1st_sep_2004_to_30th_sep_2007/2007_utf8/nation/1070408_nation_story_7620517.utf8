The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Happy, but hopping jobs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 7: A sense of restlessness coupled with ambition is driving Indias young information technology (IT) professionals to seek new jobs even when they are happy with and committed to their current jobs, says a new survey.

 The survey has indicated that over a fourth of IT job-seekers from across India are extremely happy and more than 70 per cent of those actively seeking jobs had been promoted within the past year.

 This was a surprise. It tells us that we have an IT workforce thats very young, very restless, very ambitious, and many are looking for the quickest way up the career path, said Abraham Karimpanal, vice-president and head of technology with TNS India, a global market research agency that conducted the survey. 

 This will pose challenges for IT companies, he told The Telegraph.

 The survey covered 1,886 job-seekers from among 350,000 IT professionals whove registered with CyberMedia Dice, a dedicated technology job site that provides recruiting services for engineering and technology professionals.

 Industry analysts believe Indias IT sector employs a technology workforce of about 1.1 million.

 The survey also found that average salary was highest in the western region, and lowest in the east. The highest average annual salary was Rs 4.91 lakh in the west and Rs 4.14 lakh in the east. (See chart) 

 But professionals in Bangalore and Gurgaon, a suburb of Delhi, had the highest average salary of Rs 6 lakh, followed by Mumbai where it was Rs 5.09 lakh.

 The study has revealed that employees demonstrate the highest commitment to their organisation in their first year of employment, but it drops considerably over the years. Salary does not have much impact on motivation or commitment, it said.

 IT professionals are also influenced by work culture, job content, a fair and transparent performance management and work-life balance. For IT companies, delivering on these may pose a greater challenge than salary, Karimpanal said.

 Nearly 50 per cent of the respondents had been with their companies for less than a year. But IT professionals in Delhi and Calcutta appear to display stronger moorings, with 29 per cent in both cities having worked more than three years.

 The number of hours that IT professionals put in at work also doesnt leave much time for fun or pubbing, according to the survey. Three out of five IT professionals put in eight to 10 hours, while 15 per cent put in more than 10 hours a day.

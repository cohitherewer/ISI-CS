 Lalit vs Pawar over league

 Mumbai, Aug. 9: The Indian Cricket League threatens to divide the Board of Control for Cricket in India down the middle. And the dispute is mostly about money.

 Board office-bearers, mainly the old-timers, are fiercely opposed to the ICL. But president Sharad Pawar and those close to him seem to be softening, a senior board official said.

 The BCCI insiders, led by its marketing team, will never accept this and sooner or later people will have to make a choice.

 Which broadcaster a group wants to back could become the key issue. The board, which has given Nimbus the telecast rights for all official domestic matches, is worried.

 Many on the BCCI marketing committee, headed by Lalit Modi, feel that Nimbuss Neo Sports may be left with low TRPs and poorer advertiser response when the ICLs sexed-up version of domestic cricket challenges it on Zee Sports.

 In fact, the whole idea of the ICL emerged after the board started acting tough with Zee and favouring Nimbus, the board source said, suggesting the marketing committee was alarmed at the advertiser backing for the rebel league.

 The rift in the board has a personal angle, too, sources said. Apparently alls not well between Pawar and vice-president Modi, once allies.

 Pawars flip-flops on ICL are actually a way to keep the Modi group in check. They favoured Nimbus, and Nimbus is now going to give them hell if they dont use every rule in the book to bar the ICL. Thats the game being played, a top ICL official said.

 Pawar and Modi are at odds also on the subject of the board having a president-elect like the International Cricket Council has from a year before he assumes charge.

 Modi has written to Pawar arguing the move would be futile if the other officials, too, are not elected a year in advance. The Rajasthan Cricket Association chief wants to succeed Pawar as board president. He says the current proposal may lead to a situation where the president and his team are not from the same camp.

 But if the proposal is passed at the August 21 special general meeting, the vote for the president-elect will be held at the September-end annual general meeting.

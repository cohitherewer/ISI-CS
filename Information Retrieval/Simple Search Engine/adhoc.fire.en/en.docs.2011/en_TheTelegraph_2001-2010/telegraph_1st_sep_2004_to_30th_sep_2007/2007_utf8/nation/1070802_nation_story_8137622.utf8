 Sunita points at doctors behind serial abortions

 BASANT RAWAT

 A grab of The Telegraph report published on July 29

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 1: Sunita, the Gujarat woman forced into six abortions in nine years of marriage, has identified three Vadodara hospitals where the female foetuses were killed.

 Sunita, 27, was taken to Padra, a small town near Vadodara, yesterday to locate the hospitals. The doctors, too, have been identified but not held. Kajal, 22, Rajesh Rajputs second wife who was also tortured for bearing him a girl child 40 days back, was part of the recce.

 Three hospitals have been identified. We are in the process of collecting evidence to initiate action against the errant doctors, said Wabang Jamir, the Vadodara (rural) SP.

 Rajput, arrested on Sunday and booked on torture charges, will be tried under the Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act. Offences under this law are not bailable. 

 The FIR pertains only to conducting the abortions illegally or using force to do it, Jamir said. The mother of two had no medical proof of her abortions.

 The police are preparing to write to the health department and the district collector before taking action against the doctors. Once our inquiry is complete, we will write to the appropriate authorities, Jamir said. 

 Rajput is not co-operating during interrogation, refusing to reveal much about how and where the abortions were carried out, but the police believe they have a watertight case. With Sunita identifying the hospitals and doctors, there is enough evidence to nail him. 

 Pooja setback

 As the law appeared to be catching up with the tormentors of Sunita and Kajal, another woman, Pooja Salot, watched her abusive husband and in-laws get bail.

 The husband and in-laws of Pooja, who has accused them of forcing two abortions and torturing her for failing to bear a male child in the 11 years of her marriage, were given bail by a sessions court on Monday.

 All 17 accused in the case are out of custody. Ten were arrested on July 22 and seven others, all women, had got anticipatory bail. Chirag, Poojas husband, furnished a bond of Rs 20,000 and surrendered his passport. 

 Poojas advocate Bharat Oza opposed the bail, but the judge asked the couple to resolve the dispute between themselves. The 32-year-old mother of two had alleged that Chirag and her in-laws had been mentally and physically harassing her for failing to bear a son.

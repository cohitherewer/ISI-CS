The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Step closer to plug unwanted calls

 JAYATI GHOSE

 Do not disturb

 New Delhi, June 5: Pesky telemarketers, beware: an unwanted call can cost you Rs 500.

 Telecom watchdog Trai today issued regulations for a national do-not-call (NDNC) registry to curb unsolicited marketing calls and SMSes.

 The process had started about two years back but took time as Trai had to consult telecom firms and the government.

 While the rules come into effect from today, the registry will be in place after three months. After that, a complaint on any unwanted call to telecom service providers could result in Trai slapping a fine of Rs 500 per call on the telemarketer.

 Landline and cellular subscribers, who dont want to receive unwanted calls, can register their numbers with the service providers.

 A subscriber can send a letter or an email request to the service provider to get registered.

 Within three months from today, all service providers would have to give toll-free numbers to receive requests from subscribers who want to register in the NDNC, Trai said.

 Trai officials said such requests could also be messaged if the service provider provides cellphone numbers to route them.

 A Bharti spokesperson said the company has a do-not-call service in place and clients can register their phone numbers on our website and stop getting telemarketing calls.

 Trai officials said this would be replaced by the national registry, which has legal sanction.

 A Reliance official said most telecom companies offer similar do-not-disturb services but these are restricted to commercial calls made by the service provider.

 When a subscriber registers with our do-not-call service, we make sure our commercial call centres do not disturb them. But we cant restrict other telemarketers from accessing the subscriber.

 The Trai notification sent out today states that all new subscribers would have to be given the option of registering their phone numbers with the NDNC registry.

 The registration would be free and the subscriber would be provided with a unique registration number for reference. The regulations stipulate that a number has to be included in the registry within 45 days from the date of request.

 Telemarketers would now have to verify their numbers list with the NDNC registry before making a commercial call, Trai said in its order.

 According to the order, telemarketers include content providers who offer services through SMSes and voice messages using short codes.

 The telecom authority has directed service providers to disconnect connections of telemarketers who violate the order more than twice. The initial fine is Rs 500.

 The department of telecom, which would compile the registry, will authorise the National Informatics Centre for its installation, operation and maintenance.

 As most telemarketers are employed in the banking sector, Trai has approached the Reserve Bank of India and the Indian Banks Association to ensure that those without valid registration certificates from the department of telecom are not engaged by the banks for making calls.

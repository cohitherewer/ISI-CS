 Motive hunt

 A debate is raging on the motive behind the fake encounters. One of the angles covers the marble trade in Rajasthan. 

 A police officer said it is interesting that a BJP general secretary is probably related to someone important in Rajasthan.

 That important personality runs a flourishing marble business in Alwar and Udaipur. 

 The marble company was apparently a target of Sohrabuddin Sheikhs extortion racket.

 The marble trader may have prevailed upon the BJP leader to get the Gujarat leadership to act against Sohrabuddin, sources said. They tried to substantiate the claim by citing the involvement of Rajasthan police.

 One of the arrested officers belongs to Rajasthan police. The force was also involved in another encounter related to the case.

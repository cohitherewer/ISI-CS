 Teen kills friend over football

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 17: A teenager murdered his nine-year-old friend over a football tiff and hid the body in his bedroom for two days.

 The family of Parth Panchal, the victim, had lodged a missing complaint after the boy did not return home since stepping out to play around 7.30 on Friday evening. 

 This morning, Parths friend confessed to his mother that he had killed the boy next door. What apparently made the 15-year-old own up was the faint stench he sniffed in the room. The teenager, who has been under psychiatric treatment, had shifted the body from a cupboard to a storage box in the bed in the two days since the murder.

 His shocked parents informed police, who recovered the decomposing body. He has confessed to the killing, but we could not figure out the provocation for the murder initially. He has now admitted that he killed Parth in a fit of anger. Apparently, he disliked the fact that the boy wanted to play with his football, deputy commissioner Shivaji Bodakhe said. 

 The families of the boys are next-door neighbours in Four Bungalows apartments, a middle-class housing complex in Dindoshi, near the north-western suburb of Goregaon.

 The stockbrokers son has told the police he strangled Parth with a nylon rope till he was unconscious. But, he was not over with just that. 

 To make sure Parth was dead, he throttled him with his hands. He packed the body in a plastic bag and hid it in a cupboard. When he committed the crime, he was alone in the house. His parents had gone out to visit an ailing relative. They returned home only late in the night, Bodakhe said. Parths father is a steel trader.

 The teenager, who failed twice in Class IX and appeared for his Class X board exams this year as a candidate of a private institute, did not reveal the murder to his family first, Bodakhe said. It was the foul smell that prompted him to shift the body from the cupboard into a storage box in the bed, he added.

 The statements of witnesses have confirmed the boys version. 

 Parths cousin told the police that the 15-year-old said no and behaved suspiciously when asked about his friends whereabouts. He opened the door partially and answered, but did not allow the cousin to enter, Bodakhe said. He has been booked for murder and will be produced before a juvenile court.

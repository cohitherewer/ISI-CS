 Weight notice to airline

 New Delhi, July 13 (PTI): Delhi High Court today issued a notice to Indian on a petition against the government policy to ground overweight air hostesses.

 The petition challenged an order that had upheld the policy. A division bench directed the public air carrier to file its reply by September 6.

 Arvind Sharma, appearing for the petitioners, contended that air hostesses had been grounded for being overweight only by a few hundred grams, which was illegal.

 The airlines counsel rejected the claim, saying there was a clear-cut provision in their appointment letters which required them to maintain certain physical standards, failing which they could be grounded. The counsel sought dismissal of the petition on this ground.

 However, the bench said: The matter needs some consideration.

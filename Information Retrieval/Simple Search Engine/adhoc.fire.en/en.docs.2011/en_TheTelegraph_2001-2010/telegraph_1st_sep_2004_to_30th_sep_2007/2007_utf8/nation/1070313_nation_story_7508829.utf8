 Mulayam poll plea to delay probe

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR

 New Delhi, March 12: Mulayam Singh Yadav today requested the Supreme Court to stay the CBI probe it had ordered against him till the Assembly polls were over.

 The Uttar Pradesh chief ministers application argued that it was just and necessary to stay the corruption probe, because the Centre could use it to frame him and his family to win the elections.

 The Samajwadi Party leader said the person on whose petition the court had ordered the investigation was a Congress worker. He argued that it was clear from media reports that the Samajwadi Party and the Congress were fighting a no-holds-barred political battle. Mulayam reminded the court how it had noted several times in the past that the CBI was no longer an independent agency, and often acted at the Centres behest.

 The application alleged that there was little likelihood of an independent inquiry since the episode was an attempt to frame the Yadav family. Mulayam also argued that the CBI inquiry ought to be ordered only after the income tax department, already probing the allegations, hands in its report.

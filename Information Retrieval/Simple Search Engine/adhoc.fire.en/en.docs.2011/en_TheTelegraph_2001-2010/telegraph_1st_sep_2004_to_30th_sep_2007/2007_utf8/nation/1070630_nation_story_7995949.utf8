 Hospital shuts out HIV mom 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, June 29: A teaching hospital in Meerut shut its labour room to an HIV-positive woman last night saying she might infect other patients and the doctors.

 The 27-year-old, in no condition to be shifted anywhere, delivered her child on the corridors of Lala Lajpat Rai Medical College Hospital past midnight with a little help from sympathetic nurses.

 A public uproar today led the government to suspend Dr Urmila Kariya, who was in charge of the labour room last night, and Dr Abhilasha Gupta, the head of the gynaecology department. 

 Sarita (name changed) was already in pain when she arrived at the hospital with husband Prakash.

 As soon as my wife was wheeled into the female ward, Dr Kariya said she was HIV-positive. The lady doctor said she had just seen the reports of my wifes blood tests, done when she was here for a check-up, Prakash alleged.

 Kariya later said the patient had been told during an earlier visit that she was HIV-positive, a claim Prakash challenged. Whichever version is true, the hospital was bound to take care of her delivery, doctors clarified.

 The lady doctor said, Take her away; she cannot deliver her baby here. That will put us all at risk, Prakash alleged.

 It was 10.30. I pleaded with her, saying we couldnt possibly go anywhere at this time of night. Besides, my wife needed immediate attention.

 Prakash said he then approached Gupta, the head gynaecologist, but she refused to help.

 Around 12.30, I asked some of the sympathetic nurses for some cloth and antiseptics. They did and I had to act midwife, Prakash said.

 Thank God, my wife and child are both doing fine.

 The hospital executive director, Dr Dipti Bisht, has promised to look into the matter.

 Ragging in classroom

 New Delhi, Feb. 14: The Centres anti-ragging drive could pave the way for a new course in schools dealing with violation of human rights.

 The Central Board of Secondary Education has suggested the introduction of a comprehensive course on rights abuse for Classes VIII, IX and X. 

 A seven-member committee set up by the human resource development ministry to deal with the increasing incidence of ragging had a two-hour interactive session today with educationists, policymakers, psychiatrists and students in Delhi. Members of the panel are touring different cities to work out a strategy that will put an end to ragging.

 Jitendra Nagpal, a psychiatrist at Vimhans who attended todays meeting, believes the course would help sensitise students before they step out into the world. The curriculum now includes topics like gender sensitivity and adolescent and reproductive health. So why not talk about ragging in the classroom? asked Nagpal. 

 The committee is still not clear about the strategy to be adopted. There are diverse views but there is a consensus on the need to go beyond the system we have at present, said Rajendra Prasad, the principal of Ramjas college and a member of the committee. 

 Nagpal, however, believes there is no point having a separate legislation for ragging. It is better to have a law that will deal with all forms of violation of human rights, whether it is sexual harassment, eve-teasing or ragging, he said.

 Prasad, on the other hand, feels that there has to be an anti-ragging law, which will specify punishments for offenders. The extent of ragging in remote areas is difficult to imagine here, he said. 

 Nagpal strongly advocates student protection panels on campus. Why run to police every time such an incident takes place. Let there be student protection committees in every college, he said.

 There are no centralised and codified norms yet to root out ragging, which is highest in hostels and medical and engineering institutes. Institutions adopt varying punishments for offenders from suspension for a specific period to expulsion.

 Deshmukh quit buzz

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 20: Vilasrao Deshmukh today said he did not intend to resign as Maharashtra chief minister. The denial followed rumours in sections of the state Congress that the anti-Deshmukh camp had convinced the high command about a change of guard.

 The speculation intensified this evening when reports appeared that Deshmukh was being summoned by Sonia Gandhi.

 I enjoy the confidence of the party high command. There is no question of my resignation. I have no plans of going to Delhi at this juncture. I am returning to Mumbai tomorrow morning, Deshmukh said over phone from Latur.

 Life term for Lalu MP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Shahabuddin

 Patna, May 8: The man known as a law unto himself today realised that he isnt, after all, above the law.

 A Siwan court this morning sentenced controversial RJD MP Mohammed Shahabuddin to life in jail for abducting CPI-ML worker Chhotelal Gupta eight years ago.

 Amid tight security around the special court set up in the Siwan prison, additional district and sessions judge Gyaneshwar Prasad Shrivastav also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on the don and gave him a months time to appeal. 

 On May 5, the judge had found Shahabuddin guilty under Section 364 (abduction for murder) of the IPC. 

 Last month, the court had also convicted Shahabuddin for two years for carrying out armed raids on a CPI-ML office in 1998.

 According to witness Sital Paswan, who deposed before the court, Shahabuddin called Chhotelal near the Andar railway crossing on the outskirts of Siwan and got him to board the MPs Scorpio. 

 After that, the car proceeded towards Pratappur (Shahabuddins ancestral village). Nobody has seen Chhotelal since then, Sital said.

 Sital and Chhotelal, both residents of Assaon village in Siwan, were on their way to Siwan when the MP drove away with Chhotelal. 

 Chhotelals father Dinanath Gupta also deposed in the court, but it was Sitals deposition that sealed the fate for the don, who has never lost any election he has contested in Siwan since 1990. 

 Shahabuddin was the only person named as accused in the FIR as the others accompanying him were not identified then and the prosecution failed to prove that the victim was murdered as his body could not be traced.

 Shahabuddins lawyer Zulfikar Ali said he would move the high court against the order, which is not based on facts.

 RJD chief Lalu Prasad said he would not like to comment on the verdict. But everybody has the right to appeal.

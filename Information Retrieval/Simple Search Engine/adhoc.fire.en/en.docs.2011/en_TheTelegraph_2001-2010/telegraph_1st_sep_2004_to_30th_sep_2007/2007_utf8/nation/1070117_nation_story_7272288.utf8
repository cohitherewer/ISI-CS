 Easy visa

 Luxembourg, Jan. 16 (PTI): Luxembourg, a key financial centre of Europe, has indicated it would ease the visa regime for Indian professionals in certain sectors. 

 We will look at relaxing visa rules in specific sectors, Luxembourgs economic minister Jeann Krecke said, when a group of visiting Indian journalists pointed out the visa regime in Europe as a whole was not friendly to the movement of Indian professionals. 

 Foreign minister Jean Asselborn, who will pay a five-day visit to India from February 19, said his government will consider upgrading the Luxembourg embassy in Delhi as it does not have the facility to issue visas.

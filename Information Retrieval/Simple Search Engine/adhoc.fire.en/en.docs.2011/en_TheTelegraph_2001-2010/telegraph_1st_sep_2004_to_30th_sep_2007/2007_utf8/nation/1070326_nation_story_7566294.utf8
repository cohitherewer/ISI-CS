NATION BRIEFS

 Guntur (PTI): A man tried to get his wife killed by locking her up in a room with four dogs, police said.

 The 25-year-old small-time trader, his parents and sister forced the woman into a room in their home, led four dogs into it and bolted the room from outside.

 The dogs pounced on the 20-year-old woman, married two years ago, and injured her seriously. Neighbours rescued her and rushed her to hospital, where she is said to be out of danger.

 Durban (PTI): The use of Mahatma Gandhis image in a credit card advertisement has triggered protests in South Africa with some organisations describing it as an insult to the leader.

 The ad shows Gandhi, his lips moving, speaking for the credit card of Richard Bransons British Virgin Group.

 Gandhi did not stand for the promotion of business interests, said Rugbeer Kallideen, who heads the Phoenix Settlement Trust.

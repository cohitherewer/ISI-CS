The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Aide flashes all-clear

 NISHIT DHOLABHAI

 New Delhi, Jan. 19: The manager of Mani Kumar Subbas palatial bungalow at Mehrauli laughed aloud when quizzed about the antecedents of his boss. 

 Oh, that desi-videsi case? I can tell you, Subba saab is completely clean. And this will be proved, said a confident C.M. Bhati, giving a clean chit to his parliamentarian boss. 

 Never have the police entered this farmhouse, he added, as if to drive home the point that Subba has never been on the wrong side of the law.

 Bhati perhaps did not remember that Subba was in a spot after his personal assistant, Milan Subba, was found murdered at that very farmhouse in September 2004.

 Bhati has been working for the controversial MP since 1995. 

 The three-time parliamentarian has been accused of fleeing Nepal after murdering a cousin and then claiming Indian citizenship. His name appeared in the electoral rolls of Assam in 1985.

 A CBI probe had been initiated, which entailed a request to the Nepal government for fingerprints of the accused of the same name in Nepal who has been untraceable for three decades now.

 Subba could not be contacted. The MP left for Tezpur this morning and is in a remote area, Bhati said.

 At Subba House, almost a fortress, the scene was one of nonchalance. Tall gates concealed the opulence inside, opening only when a luxury car with some family members entered the complex.

 The gates were quickly closed, shutting out the view of rows of flowers and sprawling lawns.

 He is not here and his family members say they will not speak to strangers, said the guard of the farmhouse, Shehzada Singh. 

 Angered by the Oppositions reactions to the apex courts directive to Subba on television channels, an aide of the MP attacked the National Democratic Alliance.

 The BJP and its allies, the electronic media, especially those close to the party, are all politicising the issue. Otherwise there is nothing in the case, the aide said over phone from Subbas office at Talkatora. 

 A few months ago, Subba had created a sensation by claiming that the brother of Assam education minister and Congress colleague Ripun Bora had tried to kill him. The police said no such incident took place, but Subba invited the media to see bullet marks on his vehicles to add credence to his allegation.

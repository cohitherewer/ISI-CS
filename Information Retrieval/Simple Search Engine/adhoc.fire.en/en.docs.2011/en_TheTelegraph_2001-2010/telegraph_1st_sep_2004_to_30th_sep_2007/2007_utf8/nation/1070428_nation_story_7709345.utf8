 Panel on Centre-state ties

 MANAN KUMAR 

 New Delhi, April 27: A four-member panel will look into Centre-state relations and decide if Delhi should have the right to deploy central forces to states on its own.

 It will also give its recommendations on creating a central law enforcement agency empowered to take up suo motu investigation of cases that have inter-state and international ramifications with implications to national security. 

 The government describing it as fulfilling a commitment made in the common minimum programme said the commission has been set up keeping in mind the changes that have taken place in our polity and economy since the Sarkaria Commission last looked at this issue over two decades ago. 

 Headed by former Chief Justice of India Madan Mohan Punchhi, the panel has been given the mandate to look into a variety of subjects within the realm of Centre-state relations. Its members are former Union home secretaries Dhirendra Singh and V.K. Duggal and former director of the National Judicial Academy (Bhopal) N.R. Madhava Menon.

 The panel, which has two years to submit its report, will look into the Centres role, responsibility and jurisdiction during communal, caste or other social conflicts. 

 Its mandate covers legislative and administrative relations between the Centre and states, role of governors, emergency provisions, financial relations, economic and social planning and panchayati raj institutions.

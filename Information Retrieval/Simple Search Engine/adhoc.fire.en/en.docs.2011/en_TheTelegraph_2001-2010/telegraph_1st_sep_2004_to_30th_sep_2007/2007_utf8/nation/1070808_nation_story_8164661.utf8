 Govt loosens creamy layer grip 

 New Delhi, Aug. 7 (PTI): The Centre today told the Supreme Court it was willing to keep the creamy layer out of the 27 per cent quota for OBCs in elite educational institutions, in a move aimed at getting the nod for its early implementation.

 If the court feels that the creamy layer be excluded and says so, the Centre will obey, solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati told a five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan.

 Vahanvatis submission came during the hearing of the Centres application seeking the vacation of the March 29 interim order staying the quotas implementation.

 The anti-quota petitioners opposed the Centres application, contending that it was rushing through with the implementation without addressing the issue of identifying OBCs and excluding the creamy layer among them.

 What is the changed circumstance? What is new you are arguing? asked the bench.

 The Centre had referred to a recent apex court order on quotas in Tamil Nadu, where the state government was allowed to provide 69 per cent reservation on the assurance that additional seats would be created to protect the general category. 

 The Centre had said that this fact was discovered after the March 29 order. 

 That is an unusual ground. You are not aware that the order was passed 14 years ago and it has been extended every consecutive year, the bench observed. 

 Vahanvati said seats had been increased in the educational institutions, the general category was not going to be affected and the 27 per cent quota could be staggered over three years.

 Senior advocates K.K. Venugopal, Harish Salve, Rajeev Dhavan, P.P. Rao, Mukul Rohatgi and M.M. Lahoty appeared for the petitioners.

 IIM director row

 IIM Ahmedabad director Bakul Dholakia has flayed the Centres decision to invite applications for the post of director in three IIMs.

 For the last one decade, you find more and more instances of (government) interference in the operations and autonomy of these institutions, Dholakia said.

 More significant is the (interference in) appointment of chairmen and directors of these institutes, he said, hitting out at the governments decision.

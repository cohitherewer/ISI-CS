 Maya snatches Mulayam seats

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mayavati

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: Mayavati today continued her winning streak in Uttar Pradesh, wresting from the Samajwadi Party two of three seats to which Assembly bypolls were held.

 These elections were the first popular test, although a limited one, for the Bahujan Samaj Party chief minister since she was voted to power with a simple majority last May.

 Although conventional political wisdom says the ruling party has an edge in elections held during its term, Uttar Pradesh has often bucked the trend. In 1985, the Congress lost a slew of by-elections a few months after winning a dream mandate in the Lok Sabha and Assembly.

 The biggest loser was the Samajwadi Party because it had won all the three seats Gannaur, Farrukhabad and Suar Tunda last May.

 This time, it retained Gannaur with a reduced margin and came third in Farrukhabad and Suar Tunda, which were snatched by the BSP.

 Farrukhabad and Suar Tunda had fallen vacant after newly elected Samajwadi MLAs Kazim Ali Khan and Vijay Singh joined Mayavati. Gannaur was vacated by Mulayam Singh Yadav who opted for Bharthena after winning both seats.

 Kazim, who comes from an old elite Congress family of Rampur, was given the Suar Tunda ticket by Mayavati. Vijay, however, was thrown out of the BSP after Mayavati got to know of his alleged involvement in the murder of BJP leader Brahm Dutt Dwivedi.

 Dwivedi was killed years ago but he had an emotional link with Mayavati. He rescued her when she was set upon by Samajwadi Party activists in the infamous Lucknow state guest house incident of 1995. Dwivedi was since her rakhi brother.

 Vijay fought on a Congress ticket from Farrukhabad but lost to BSP minister Anant Mishra. Mayavati was advised that Vijays candidacy would alienate Brahmins of the area because Dwivedi, a Brahmin, had grown into a legend after he was killed.

 The loss of Suar Tunda was just as galling for the Samajwadi Party because it is a Muslim-majority constituency, where the party had tried to whip up sentiment on the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 Mulayam, Amar Singh and Azam Khan, the partys best-known Muslim face, had campaigned hard but were pipped at the post by the BSP and the BJP, which came second.

 Political observers believe the Samajwadi Party held on to Gannaur only because it is a Yadav-dominated constituency.

 Mulayam can ignore the signal at his peril but it proves that it is only the Yadavs who have remained faithful to him, a Congress official said.

 A relative of Kazim said: For the next five years, voters will root for Mayavati come what may, because in UP, power and patronage hold the key to everything.

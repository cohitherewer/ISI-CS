 Thiruvananthapuram, April 29: Becoming literate at 68 was mind-boggling enough and Chelekkodan Ayesha promptly got her reward: stardom on a national platform.

 But the impoverished grandmother from Kerala had only just begun.

 On Friday, aged 84, she wrote the second of her four school-leaving examination papers and said she was confident about getting through.

 It was in 1990 that Ayesha had enrolled herself in a government-sponsored, one-year literacy drive and learnt to read, write and make simple calculations. The timing was perfect.

 The next year, Kerala became the first Indian state to become fully literate and the government picked the spirited learner from the then backward Malappuram district to make the official announcement.

 She did, before a 100,000-strong crowd at Kozhikodes Mananchira maidan, and capped the declaration by reciting verses from the Quran.

 In a country used to stars long on hype but short on desire, none would have expected what followed. Honoured because of her advanced age, Ayesha showed the hunger of a rookie.

 Being from a poor Muslim family, I never had the opportunity for formal education. What I had gathered as a student of the literacy movement kindled in me a desire for more knowledge, Ayesha said.

 But money was a problem. She was dependent on her widowed daughter who worked as a domestic maid and was struggling to send her own three children to school.

 Ayesha wrote to the state literacy mission director for help. But a newspaper carried a story about her and, before government help could arrive, private aid poured in.

 Some sent books and others study equipment. Some, including a newspaper house, sent money to pay for her education.

 By enrolling in Akshaya, the government-sponsored e-literacy programme, Ayesha also learnt to use computers.

 On Thursday, she sat down to write her first paper for the State Secondary School Leaving Certificate Equivalency examination a slightly watered-down version of the main SSLC.

 Ayesha is among the 700 candidates who appeared for the examination on Thursday. She had earlier cleared the fourth and seventh equivalency tests (held after Class IV and Class VII) with high marks, said state literacy mission director N. Jayadevan.

 After she passes the four-day exam, she will get a certificate, as good as the regular one.

 What does she plan to do next?

 I want to continue studying as long as age permits. I feel like taking up new challenges after every exam, she said.

 Shes a role model for the country. Its the likes of her who have made Malappuram a shining example of Keralas rapid progress on the human development scale, an official connected with the e-literacy drive said.

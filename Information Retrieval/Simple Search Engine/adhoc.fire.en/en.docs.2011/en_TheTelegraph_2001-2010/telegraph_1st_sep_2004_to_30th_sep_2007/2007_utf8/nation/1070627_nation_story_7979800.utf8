 Lid off minister molest report

 JOHN MARY

 P.J. Joseph

 Thiruvananthapuram, June 26: The report against the former Kerala minister who resigned on charges of attempted molestation of a co-passenger has become public in spite of the government suppressing it for months.

 Inspector-general B. Sandhyas probe confirms the allegation by former Surya TV newsreader Lekshmi Gopakumar, 55, that P.J. Joseph outraged her modesty on the Kingfisher Chennai-Kochi flight on August 3 last year. Josephs claim that he was the victim of a political conspiracy was dismissed as an excuse.

 In her affidavit to the officer, Lekshmi, a grandmother living with her chartered-accountant husband in Chennai, said when the lights were off and the flight was about to take off she felt a slimy, crawl on her breast.

 When I turned my head, I saw a hand shying away, behind me. Seat-belted, I shouted, asking the VIP whether he wasnt ashamed. I pressed the alarmhe had touched my left breast. 

 Joseph, reacting to a local channel running excerpts of the report, said the media was trying to blow up a nine-month-old one-sided report. His refrain was the same as it was before he resigned the woman must have been out of her senses to term a mere touch as molestation.

 The NGO that made the report public had to struggle to get a copy under the information act, raising questions on the Left regimes sincerity in sharing information with the public.

 Attempts by D.B Binu, who heads the NGO Niyama Sahaya Vedi, to get the report were stonewalled. The documents were handed only after he moved high court.

 But his battle isnt over yet. Curiously, several pages of the report are missing. I will approach the court again to get a certified (full) copy. Thats my next fight, Binu said.

 Former Congress legislator P.T. Thomas said chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan should explain why the pages were missing.

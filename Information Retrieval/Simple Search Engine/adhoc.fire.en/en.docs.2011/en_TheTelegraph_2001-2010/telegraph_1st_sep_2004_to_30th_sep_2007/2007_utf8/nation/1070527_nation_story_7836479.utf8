The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 The lionheart and the commissar

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, May 26: V.S. Achuthanandan had once fought turf battles against Citu bosses with the aid of Pinarayi Vijayan and then helped his comrade become the state party secretary.

 Its a joke played by fate that now, after an eight-year-old feud for supremacy, they are bracketed together again as recipients of the partys most serious action ever against leaders of their size.

 The two mens styles and strengths are contrasting. Chief minister Achuthanandan draws his power from his larger-than-life image of a peoples hero whom his party critics are trying to crucify.

 Vijayan is the apparatchik, an organisation man who has been patiently plotting his rivals downfall by systematically removing his loyalists from every party rung.

Both belong to the backward Ezhava community, which has been waiting for decades to see one of its own in the chief ministers chair. Yet, while few from the community see Vijayan as their representative, Achuthanandans origins have increased his appeal.

 Although the feud is personality-driven, shorn of genuine ideological differences, Achuthanandan has been able to project himself as a hardliner, ready to champion causes that have been slogans with the party.

 For instance, the chief minister was unrelenting in his opposition, at least in public, to his government being forced by the party central leadership to accept an infrastructure loan from the Asian Development Bank.

 The loan had been sought by the previous, Congress-led government but was sanctioned by the Centre only after Achuthanandan had assumed office. The CPM politburo, too, had cleared the loan, prompting the chief minister to hit out at party colleagues and ministers. This brought a warning from CPM general secretary Prakash Karat.

 Next it was Vijayans turn to be chastised by Karat, for not regularly convening the five-member coordination committee meeting.

 Karat led several missions to Kerala to broker peace. He set up a coordination committee to effect a truce.

 When none of this worked, the party leadership tried to keep both leaders out of the fray during last years Assembly polls.

 But Achuthanandan had his sympathisers in the politburo. Leaders such as Brinda Karat felt this was the doughty veterans turn to become chief minister after having missed out twice before. In the 1996 polls, he had been defeated by his own party comrades in his home turf of Mararikulam.

 Achuthanandan, whose faction lost out heavily in the Malappuram state conference three years ago, knows this is the end-game for him. He has been puffing his chest out in public and alternately playing knight and martyr.

 Public adulation and sympathy for him cuts across social and political groups.

 The lionheart image got a boost when the chief minister sent his bulldozers to Munnar hill station, where resorts and hotels had come up in blatant violation of land conservancy laws.

 Vijayan, fuming at the media hype around the drive, levelled his favourite charge that a media syndicate was showing the state party leadership in poor light while glorifying one individual.

 The chief minister had other reasons to be happy, too. He had clinched the deal for the Rs 1,000-crore Smart City project pipping several rival chief ministers, including Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, and emerged as a tough bargainer looking after the states interests.

 The vitriol burst into the open on May 23. At the weekly cabinet briefing, Achuthanandan scoffed at Vijayans bogey of a media syndicate. He alleged that the very same people who blame the media syndicate often relied on it to serve their own ends.

 He indirectly accused Vijayan of trying to tarnish his government through selective media leaks of closed-door discussions on the Munnar operation. Vijayan hit back with accusations that Achuthanandan lacked courtesy and was sowing confusion.

 The next day, as the two leaders arrived in Delhi for the politburo meeting, their supporters carried the battle to the precincts of Kerala House. Achuthanandans loyalists denounced filmstar Mammooty, a friend of Vijayan, for annexing government land in Munnar.

 Achuthanandan is also believed to have been planning to take on the Tatas by reclaiming a part of the land leased to them in Munnar on the ground of lease violations.

 After the suspension, the chief minister returned to Thiruvananthapuram tonight. He was mobbed by reporters at the airport but left without a word.

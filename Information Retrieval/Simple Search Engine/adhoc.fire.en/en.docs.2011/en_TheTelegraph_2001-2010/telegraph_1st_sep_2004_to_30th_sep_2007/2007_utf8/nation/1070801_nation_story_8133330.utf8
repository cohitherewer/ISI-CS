 Star plus: Prison roll of honour swells

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 

 (From top) Haridas Mundhra, Shibu Soren and Arundhati Roy: Jail bond 

 New Delhi, July 31: Sanjay Dutt may be in jail but he belongs to a select band of Indians far more illustrious than his immediate neighbours.

 The A-list of Indians who have spent time behind bars boasts a Calcutta industrialist, a serving minister, a hard-hitting opening batsman, an acclaimed author and a few members of Sanjays Bollywood fraternity.

 But only two celebrity convictions that of industrialist Haridas Mundhra and former Union minister Shibu Soren come close to that of Sanjay in terms of severity as most others were either token sentences or the accused did not spend too much time in jail.

 The Mundhra case (the ubiquitous word scam had not yet made it to the countrys political lexicon) was the first big-ticket financial scandal to rock independent India.

 The Life Insurance Corporation of India had picked up shares valued at Rs 1.25 crore in six companies belonging to Mundhra to bail them out. 

 The six companies Richardson Cruddas, Jessops, Smith Stanistreet, Osler Lamps, Agnelo Brothers and British India Corporation were going though a rough patch and Mundhra was accused of bleeding them further.

 The lid was blown off the surreptitious deal by Feroze Gandhi, the son-in-law of then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, in 1958, triggering a nationwide uproar that forced finance minister T.T. Krishnamachari to resign.

 An inquiry commission was appointed and believe it or not the proceedings were broadcast over loudspeakers in a remarkable show of transparency long before the word became fashionable in corporate boardrooms. Mundhra was eventually sentenced to 22 years in jail.

 The other VIP convicted and sent to prison for a long period is Soren, who was handed a life term in a murder case when he was a Union minister.

 Soren was convicted in November last year of the murder of his former secretary Shashinath Jha. The JMM leader has spent eight months in jail so far, first in Delhi and then in Ranchi. 

 Earlier this year, former Indian opening batsman Navjot Sidhu, remembered for the massive sixes he struck off Australian Shane Warne, was sentenced to three years in jail for an assault after a parking lot dispute that led to an elderly mans death. 

 Sidhu got, for the first time in the history of the Supreme Court, a stay on the high court order while his appeal is heard in the apex court. He is out on bail and commenting on cricket again. 

 Sanjays fellow Bollywood star Salman Khan spent three days in jail for shooting black bucks before his bail plea was accepted. 

 Among politicians, the late Narasimha Rao was convicted in the JMM bribery case and was eventually subjected to a technical arrest for an hour or so when his bail expired. Rao was the first former Prime Minister to be convicted but a higher court later acquitted him.

 Celebrity author Arundhati Roy chose to go to prison in a contempt case. However, after a day in jail, she paid a fine and cut short what could have been a three-month stay behind bars.

 Seattle, July 7: The next phase in the current phenomenal growth of civil aviation in India will be in the countrys eastern region, according to the chairman and managing director of Air India, V. Thulasidas.

 Air India hopes to operationally put the eastern region as a whole on the global aviation map and has already linked Dhaka to its Calcutta-London flight, he told Indian correspondents here yesterday.

 Thulasidas, who will on April 1, 2008, become chairman and managing director of the new airline being created by the merger of Air India and Indian, is in Seattle for the roll-out of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, described as the most economical and fuel-efficient jet ever.

 Air India has ordered 27 of these planes as part of its huge expansion that is under way. The airline will link Calcutta to its existing Bangalore-Singapore flight later this year, and Guwahatis current place on Air Indias map will be maintained.

 Thulasidas, who was chief secretary of Tripura prior to heading Air India in 2003, recalled that during his postings there, air links between the state and Calcutta were extremely poor.

 But now there are seven to eight flights a day between Tripura and Calcutta, he pointed out, as an example of the potential and projected growth of civil aviation in the eastern region.

 Bhubaneswar was another airport with potential as mineral development accelerates in Orissa.

 He said he expected Calcutta to be the hub for expanding domestic and international flights through the eastern region, which would require new investment in aviation infrastructure in the city.

 Aviation sources here said Calcutta had lost the race for a $100-million maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility for Boeing planes belonging to Air India, other Indian carriers and third country airlines.

 The MRO, a joint venture between Boeing and Air India, is part of a deal for the purchase of 68 new Boeing aircraft including 27 Dreamliners by Air India at a cost of about $11 billion, the biggest order in the airlines history.

 The facility will now be located in Nagpur.

 Thulasidas said Boeing would invest in another $75-million joint training venture in India and a further $10 million on aviation infrastructure.

 Other sources said Calcutta was in the running for at least one of these projects.

 The Air India chairman said these joint venture investments by Boeing were in addition to offsets to the value of 30 per cent of the entire cost of the order for new aircraft from the US manufacturer.

 Thulasidas said the inauguration of Air Indias first non-stop flight between Mumbai and New York on August 1 was part of a strategic plan to make the carrier one of Asias top five airlines in the next 10 years.

 Direct flights to the US on the New Delhi-New York, Mumbai-Chicago and Mumbai-San Francisco sectors are also being planned as new long-range planes ordered by the airline arrive in India from the end of this month.

 Board rips burqa baiters

 Chennai, Jan. 10: An All-India Muslim Personal Law Board top gun today criticised Western culture for its lack of tolerance for something as harmless as a burqa, reports our special correspondent. 

 Moulana Muhammed Rabe Hasani Nadwi was alluding to the veil controversy that has often erupted in some countries of Europe.

 Nadwi, speaking at the boards 19th session here, said he believed there was a need to explain the significance of Shariat to the non-Muslims who would appreciate its family laws governing personal and mutual relations in society.

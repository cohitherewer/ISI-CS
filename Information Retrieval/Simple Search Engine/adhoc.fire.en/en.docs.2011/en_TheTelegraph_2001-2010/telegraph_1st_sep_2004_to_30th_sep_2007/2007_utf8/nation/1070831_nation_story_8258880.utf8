 Gender cloud on baby death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Barrackpore, Aug. 30: A woman has allegedly thrown her infant daughter into a well and disappeared because her husband refused to accept the girl.

 Police said the mother might have jumped into the well, but no body has been found. 

 Bidhan Sarkars one-month-old daughter went missing from his in-laws in Baranagar, on the citys northern fringes, on Tuesday. The babys body was fished out of the well today. 

 We have arrested Bidhan and are looking for his wife Ronita, a police officer said. Officials said Ronita and Bidhan have a six-year-old daughter. Their relationship soured when the second child, too, turned out to be a girl, the police said.

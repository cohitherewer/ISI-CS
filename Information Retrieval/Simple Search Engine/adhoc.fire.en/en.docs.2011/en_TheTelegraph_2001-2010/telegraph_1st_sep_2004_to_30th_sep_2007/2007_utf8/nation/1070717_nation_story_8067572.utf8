 Third front plays minority card for VP poll

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 16: The United National Progressive Alliance, also known as the third front, tried to pre-empt the UPA-Left by proposing the name of Rasheed Masood as its vice-presidential candidate.

 Masood, who hails from west Uttar Pradesh, is a Samajwadi Party MP and a former Union minister.

 Announcing his candidacy in Mumbai, Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh tried to score a brownie point over the Congress by claiming Masoods credentials were definitely better than those of President aspirant Pratibha Patil and that he was the UNPAs unanimous choice.

 The Congress and the Left were unmoved by the announcement and maintained that their search for a consensus candidate was on. 

 Amar ruled out the Congresss support for Masood and sounded uncertain of the Lefts. We are always in talks with the Left but we understand that it is their political compulsion to support the UPA and its candidate, PTI quoted him as saying.

 The BJP refused to commit itself, saying it would wait and watch to see if UNPA constituents such as the ADMK and the Indian National Lok Dal which were reportedly inclined to back Bhairon Singh Shekhawat for President would stick by Masood till the end.

 It seems as though the Samajwadi foisted Masood over the others because of its Muslim vote-bank compulsion. Our guess is the Telugu Desam Party also may endorse the choice for the same reason of minority appeasement, claimed a BJP source.

 UPA sources conceded that had the UNPA put up Farooq Abdullahs name as was speculated earlier it may have set off a bit of churning within the ruling coalition, not because he is Muslim but because he is from Kashmir. 

 Masood, a product of the Lok Dal school of politics, was unlikely to trigger any such dilemma because, as a Congress source put it, we have a thousand more concrete ways of assuring the Muslims of Uttar Pradesh than backing one of them for the Vice-Presidents post.

 As the CPM and the CPI laid down certain ground rules for the next big election in the capital, notably that of not necessarily having a political candidate, all eyes are on Sonia Gandhi. 

 The Congress president is likely to reveal her mind after July 19 when the votes are cast for President. 

 Until then, she wants to suggest nothing that may annoy or discomfit the Left, said a source.

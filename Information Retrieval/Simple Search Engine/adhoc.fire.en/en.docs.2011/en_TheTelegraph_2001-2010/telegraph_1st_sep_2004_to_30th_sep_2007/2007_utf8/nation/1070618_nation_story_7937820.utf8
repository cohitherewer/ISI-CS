 Assam Rifles out of army clutches

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, June 17: The central paramilitary force that handles some of the toughest counter-insurgency assignments in the northeastern states with officers borrowed from the army is on its way to becoming independent of the armed forces.

 The home ministry has recommended to the defence ministry that the Assam Rifles be allowed to raise its own cadre of officers, just like the other six central paramilitary forces do. 

 The proposal is the result of the home ministrys belated realisation the Assam Rifles has been in existence for over a century that there is very little camaraderie between officers and jawans of the force.

 Army officers come on deputation to Assam Rifles for three years and obviously cannot develop the kind of bonding with jawans that an officer from a dedicated cadre can. This can have a bearing on the efficiency of the force, especially during a crisis, a home ministry official said. 

 If the defence ministry endorses the proposal, officers of the Assam Rifles will be recruited through a centralised selection process conducted by the Union Public Service Commission.

 The proposal has already received the thumbs-up from army officers commanding Assam Rifles units.

 It will help the Assam Rifles fill the 18 to 20 per cent vacancies that are there at present. The shortage of officers cannot be rectified under the existing system as the army itself is short of over 10,000 officers. Once the Assam Rifles has its own bosses, the army will be able to withdraw hundreds of its officers from the force, a source said.

 From assistant commandants to the director general, the Assam Rifles gets 85 per cent of its 850 officers from the army. The remaining 15 per cent are those who have risen up the ranks from the 67,000-strong general cadre. Under the present system, it would take a minimum of 20 years for a rifleman to rise to the rank of assistant commandant.

 By the time someone becomes an assistant commandant, he is at least 40 years of age and unfit to command a platoon. In comparison, an army captain who joins the Assam Rifles as assistant commandant is barely 22. The topmost position a rifleman can reach is the level of commandant, equivalent to the rank of a lieutenant colonel in the army. This system has bred discontent within the force, the source said. 

 Assam Rifles picks its jawans from across the country. Of the nine recruitment rallies held since April, one was in Shillong. 

 Cachar Levy, a force of 750 men that was formed by the British in 1835 to protect settlements in the Northeast from tribal raiders, was the genesis of the Assam Rifles. The force was merged with Assam Military Police in 1870. Assam Military Police troopers were part of the Indian forces that fought for Britain in Europe and the Middle East during World War I. The name Assam Rifles was assigned to them in 1917 as recognition of their bravery in the war.

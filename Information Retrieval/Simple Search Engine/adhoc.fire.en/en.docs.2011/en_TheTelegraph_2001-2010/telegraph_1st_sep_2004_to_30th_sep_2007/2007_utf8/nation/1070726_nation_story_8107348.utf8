 Naxal mystery in kidnap

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, July 25: After the return of kidnapped Satyam group executive V. Satyanarayana, several versions are doing the rounds on where and how he was freed.

 According to Hyderabad police commissioner Balwinder Singh, Satyanarayanas kidnappers were pseudo-Naxals and the motive for the crime was money. 

 Sources said the executives driver, V. Mohan, gave the abductors information on his daily movements. Mohan has been arrested, along with another person, but a hunt is on for six to eight others believed to be involved. They include alleged mastermind Katti Venkateswarlu, whom police described as a pseudo-Maoist.

 On Tuesday night, when the commissioner announced Satyanarayana had been rescued, Singh had spoken of four culprits. It appears that at least eight to 10 individuals were part of the team, he told a news conference where the executive, looking tired, was also present.

 According to the commissioner, the police raided a farmhouse believed to be at an undisclosed location in Warangal, a one-and-a-half-hour drive from Hyderabad and freed the 40-year-old.

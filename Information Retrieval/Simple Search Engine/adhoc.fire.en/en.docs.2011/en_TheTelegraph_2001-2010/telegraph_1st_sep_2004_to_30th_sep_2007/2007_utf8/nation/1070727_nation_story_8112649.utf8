 July 26: Delhi today confirmed that the bird flu outbreak in Manipur has been caused by H5N1, the deadliest among the avian virus strains spreading across continents since 2003 and also the one that poses the greatest risk to humans. 

 Officials said the confirmation would not change anything on the ground as intensive culling operations are under way. 

 This is the second outbreak of H5N1 in India after the virus first surfaced in a Maharashtra district in February last year. That outbreak was bigger and involved thousands of poultry. The infection had spread to another district before it was stamped out. 

 Officials say about 150,000 chickens in 128 small poultry units within a 5km zone around the infected farm, located at Chingmeirong on the outskirts of Imphal would need to be culled. More than half of the birds are in backyard poultry farms, just as the one where the virus emerged this time.

 The officials estimate that the hot zone also has a population of about 28,000 ducks. 

 The Regional Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) and the government-run Jawaharlal Nehru hospital in Imphal have been geared up to treat people who might be affected by the virus. RIMS director L. Fimate convened a meeting of all heads of departments and senior doctors today.

 The institute later opened an isolation ward with 12 beds. Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital has also opened an isolation ward. 

 Director of health Th. Suresh held a series of meetings with officials of the veterinary and health departments. No human has been affected by the virus so far. But we are not taking any chances, he said.

 A team of doctors visited Chingmeirong yesterday to administer Tamiflu, a proven antidote to avian flu in humans, to members of the family that owns the farm where the H5N1 virus has been detected.

 Medical teams, each led by a doctor, fanned out into areas within a 3km radius of the farm today to check whether anybody had symptoms of the disease. We have constituted 35 medical teams. We are also keeping medical teams on standby in other districts. If required, we will requisition the services of teams from the other districts, Suresh said. 

 Most of the Northeast states were on their toes, too. In Assam, the focus was on Cachar, North Cachar Hills, Karbi Anglong, Golaghat and Jorhat, which border Manipur. 

 The district heads have clamped a ban on import of poultry and chicken feed from both Manipur and Nagaland. 

 The governments of Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram have banned import of poultry from outside the states. 

 In Meghalaya, the veterinary and animal husbandry department is monitoring sale and entry of poultry into the state. The joint director of the veterinary and animal husbandry department, D. Lyngdoh, said all basic precautionary measures had been taken. 

 Delhi has long banned poultry trade with bird flu-hit nations like China, Bangladesh and Myanmar, but officials are worried about people bringing poultry illegally across the borders.

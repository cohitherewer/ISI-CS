 Two killed as vessel sinks 

 Mangalore, June 23 (PTI): Two crew members were killed and 21 rescued after a cargo vessel today sank off the Thannirbhavi coast, 13 km from here. One person is missing, a top police official said.

 The coast guard, personnel from New Mangalore Port Trust and local fishermen launched efforts to rescue the 24-member crew trapped on Den Den when it began sinking after developing engine problems last night.

 The teams retrieved two bodies and brought the 21 crew members ashore, said P. Dayanand, Dakshina Kannadas superintendent of police.

 The deceased have been identified as Tesfamariam Derhane and Meheri G. Hazibhier, both Eritrean nationals. The rescued crew members, who hail from Sri Lanka, Pakistan and African nations, have been admitted to hospitals.

 The vessel, owned by a company in Eritrea and loaded with furnace oil slag, was on its way to Dubai from the New Mangalore port. 

 When its engines failed at Panambur beach, high-velocity winds pushed it towards Thannirbhavi where it turned turtle and sank. Details on whether the containers had developed cracks were not available.

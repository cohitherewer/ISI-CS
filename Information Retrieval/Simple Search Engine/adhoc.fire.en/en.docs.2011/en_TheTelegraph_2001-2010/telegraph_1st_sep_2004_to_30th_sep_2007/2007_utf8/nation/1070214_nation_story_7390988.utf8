New Delhi, Feb. 13: The trilateral meeting tomorrow between external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee and his Russian and Chinese counterparts, Sergei Lavrov and Li Zhaoxing, respectively, is expected to mark more than merely the recognition of Indias growing political stature internationally.

 At a time when India is strengthening its relations with the US and its foreign policy is being projected as an appendage of the American foreign policy, the trilateral meeting would send an important contrary message.

 Although the trilateral meeting has nothing to do with any ideological framework as in the heyday of communism, India would be seen to be associating with the two powers that are most vociferous today in their criticism of US unilateralism, arguing for a multi-polar world and strengthening the UN. 

 To that extent then, this trilateral meeting the fourth such gathering, would help correct the perception about the pro-US tilt in Indias perspective of the world.

 Of late, Russia has become more and more dependent on China to counter US unilateralism. Neither wants to go too far in that direction on only a Sino-Russian basis and the inclusion of India gives greater credibility to their efforts to counter US hegemony.

 Without India intending it to be seen that way, a fallout of the meeting would be to increase pressure on the US and the West to further strengthen their ties with India to make sure that India does not move too far into any configuration with anti-West overtones. This increases Indias bargaining capacity globally.

 The significance of the trilateral platform, from the Russian perspective, also lies in boosting Moscows efforts to help the process of normalisation of Sino-Indian ties.

 Indian foreign policy experts believe that there are immediate regional benefits also to be had. They point out: In the South Asian context, this is also a subtle way of balancing a strong China-Pakistan nexus. The message that goes out is that while the Chinese have a strong relationship with Pakistan in South Asia, Beijing is forging a different order of relationship with India in a global context.

 Given Indias intention to extend and enlarge its footprint in its extended neighbourhood, the trilateral meeting gives an opportunity to the three countries to harmonise their views and policies in Central Asia. Indias inclusion is important in this process as Russia and China are the two most important players in Central Asia.

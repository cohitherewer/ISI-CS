 Teacher in US jail for abuse

 New York, April 20 (AP): A former Indian-American headmistress of a Manhattan school has been sentenced to a maximum of 14 years in prison for a sex liaison with an underage male student.

 Lina Sinha, 40, showed no reaction as Manhattan supreme court judge Carol Berkman pronounced the sentence yesterday. Sinha, who faced as much as 18 years, must serve four years and eight months before being eligible for parole.

 Shes intelligent, educated, well-raised, hardworking and beautiful, and shes a predator who lived a lie, Berkman said.

 She abused the position of trust she had with (the victim). She took a great deal, I think, from (the victim).

 Sinha, whose family owns the exclusive school, was convicted of sexual assault on a student when he was 13 and again when he was older.

 The victim, now a 24-year-old New York City police officer, had alleged that Sinha began sexual relations with him saying she loved him and that one day they would marry.

 He said she taught him to reach her bedroom above the school by sneaking past security cameras installed by her parents. She stocked her room with video games and kept him there on weekends.

 The prosecution said the two allegedly met at a number of places, including a school van, and their relationship ended after the student was transferred to another school when he turned 17.

 Sinha was also convicted of trying to bribe a second teen to lie about their alleged sexual relationship.

 Berkman said the fact that Sinha came from an advantaged background makes her offences all the more culpable than the poorer, less educated defendants that the judge usually sees. She cant claim she knew no better.

 Berkman allowed Sinha to remain free on a $3.5 million bond until Monday while her lawyers appeal the conviction.

 The jury was deadlocked on six rape counts, including those relating to the second teen, allegedly seduced by her when he was a 12-year-old seventh grader, prosecutors said. 

 They said they intended to retry Sinha on the undecided charges.

 Jayalalithaa in fresh land row

Land deals have long haunted Jayalalithaa, but in her home state. Now, the plot has shifted to Hyderabad.

 Last week, the high court rejected her request to stay an order that threatens to end her possession of a tract of land allegedly purchased from the poor illegally.

 The land revenue officer of Qutbullapur, on the outskirts of Hyderabad, served a notice on the ADMK boss, charging her with violating the Andhra assigned lands act. She was asked to explain why the eight acres she bought in the area should not be seized.

 The land was given away to the urban poor and cant be transferred or sold. Jayalalithaas lawyers argued, to no avail, that the purchases were made before the act kicked in. Not impressed, the court refused to stay the showcause, saying there was enough prima facie evidence that rules had been breached. 

 But the former Tamil Nadu chief minister can take consolation from the fact that she isnt the only bigwig in trouble. Even Ramoji Rao and his famous Ramoji Film City are in the line of threat from the land law. 

 Good Samaritan on tracks

Whoever said Mumbaikars are not caring enough might like to read this. Commuting to work, Rajendra Somaiya spotted a woman sobbing when he got off at Mulund station. He was soon told she couldnt get her child off the train.

 As Somaiya hopped on to the next local in search of the kid, the lady approached the police, which ensured that the message about her child was flashed across stations.

 At one of the stations en route, Somaiya came to know that the kid had been found at Nahar station. Once there, he found the child with an unidentified man. 

 Somaiya waited with the kid till the mother arrived. But he didnt mind the lost time. I reached office 30 minutes late, but its fine. I am happy I could help them.

Chennai, sometimes considered an academic backwater, can boast of an institute that could rival the Tata Institute of Fundamental Researchs teaching and research in mathematics, physics and computer science.

 Chennai Mathematical Institute has won the University Grants Commissions recognition as a full-fledged university. Students with an analytical bent of mind and a zest for research can put the institute on their radar. 

 The institute offers B.Sc. (Honours) courses in the three subjects, besides postgraduate and doctoral programmes. 

 Professors from the TIFR, the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta and IIT Chennai are part of the faculty, as are some of the best minds from the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research in Kalpakkam. 

 Application forms for the 2007-08 academic year are available. You can visit www.cmi.ac.in for more details. 

 Tough cure

It nurses patients back to health, but now a famous Delhi hospital is having to dismember one of its own limbs.

 A committee on unauthorised constructions in the capital, appointed by the high court, last week asked Apollo Hospitals to demolish a wall it built on encroached land.

 Inspections showed that the wall had been built on land owned by the National Highway Authority. Hospital officials denied any encroachment, saying the land was provided by the Delhi government. Apollo wasnt alone in the breach. Some corporate offices had also invaded public space, mostly to make room for parking lots.

 Sirsa, Feb. 25: Sonia Gandhi today steered clear of the political storm over Bofors but for a brief indirect reference at a Congress rally to celebrate two years of its government in Haryana.

 In her first public address since news broke of Ottavio Quattrocchis detention in Argentina, Sonia stuck to the achievements of the Hooda government, only making a passing reference to Bofors.

 I appeal to all in the country to ignore the allegations that are being levelled against the Congress party right now, the Congress president said towards the end of her 15-minute speech.

 The government is likely to come under fire from Opposition parties in Parliament over its silence on Quattrocchis detention for nearly two weeks.

 Condemning the recent bomb blasts on the Atari Special in which 68 people died Sonia said those behind the heinous crime would be brought to book.

 Farmers concerns, she added, would be looked into during land acquisition for development or industry.

 A crowd of close to a lakh was left in splits after a slip of tongue midway through Sonias speech. Haryana is doing well, but is headed for a still brighter future under chief minister Upendra Singh Hooda eh Bhupendra Singh Hooda.

 Sonia lauded Hoodas efforts in correcting Haryanas lopsided sex ratio. The chief minister, she said, was trying his best through awareness campaigns to reduce the practice of female infanticide.

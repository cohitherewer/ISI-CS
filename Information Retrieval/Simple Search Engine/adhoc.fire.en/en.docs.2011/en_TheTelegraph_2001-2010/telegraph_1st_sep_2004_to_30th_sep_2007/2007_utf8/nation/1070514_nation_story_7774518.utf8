 Useful bump on road to Raisina 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mukherjee

 New Delhi, May 13: The half-kilometre leap from South Block to Raisina Hill may not be as easy for Pranab Mukherjee as it seemed a week ago.

 As the UPA and the Left are preparing to finalise their presidential nominee, it is believed that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is not keen to let go of the external affairs minister.

 Singh and Sonia Gandhi, who spent six hours on Friday together on their flight from Delhi to Chennai and back, reportedly discussed the election. The view emerging in the government and the Congress was Mukherjees departure would unsettle both these apparatuses.

 The Prime Minister relied almost entirely on Mukherjee for his political inputs and advice on macro and micro matters. Whether it was a river water dispute or tackling insurgency in the Northeast, Singh turned to Mukherjee.

 The external affairs minister heads many groups of ministers, including those on reservations, the creation of Telengana and delimitation. 

 As leader of the Lok Sabha, Mukherjee is the guide the treasury benches turn to during parliamentary crises that require a nuanced reading of the Constitution or the rules of procedure.

 A source close to Singh said that when he concluded that a certain issue was political, he would leave it to Mukherjee and the Congresss senior leaders. 

 As Mukherjees name gained currency, the joke in the party was its strategy sessions would take place in Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 Had the presidential election taken place closer to 2009, when the general elections are due, Mukherjee could have been spared. 

 But with two tumultuous years left, as Congress sources put it, the government and the party needed him all the more, especially with the churning in the Hindi heartland and the upcoming crucial elections in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi and Rajasthan.

 It is also learnt that while the Left parties had no problems with Mukherjee, NCP chief Sharad Pawar was a bit cold to the proposal. Pawars first choice was the other Congress nominee being spoken about Sushil Kumar Shinde.

 His party colleague and civil aviation minister Praful Patel had backed the elevation of Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat some time ago but Pawar shot down the idea.

 While Lalu Prasad has indicated that he would go along with the UPAs unanimous choice, the opinion of the other key leader, M. Karunanidhi, has not been sussed out. 

 The third Congress nominee, Karan Singh, was not acceptable to anybody.

 Although Shinde, a Dalit from Maharashtra, has Pawars backing, the views of Dalit leader Mayavati would be the most critical in the current electoral college. The Uttar Pradesh chief minister has enough MLAs to tilt the balance.

 She officially said today that it was too early for her to speak on the presidential election. However, the Congress has gathered through its interlocutors that Mayavati would like to see a heartland Brahmin in Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

 The BSP chief wants to use every occasion to signal her commitment to the new rainbow coalition of Dalits, upper castes and Muslims. Endorsing a Brahmin incumbent is in step with this strategy. 

 Besides, Mayavati is unlikely to support Shinde as she will not be keen to create another possible Dalit power centre.

 Mayavatis reported preference has added a twist. The issue is expected to figure in the consultations the Congress will have with the Left and the UPA parties next week.

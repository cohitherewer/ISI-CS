 Court prolongs Gujarat agony

 - SC gives state two more weeks before it decides on a CBI probe 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 3: The Supreme Court today admitted a plea for a CBI inquiry into the Gujarat fake encounter case but did not order one, giving the state two more weeks to place its own probe report.

 The court also asked the Gujarat government to hand in a report on the allegation that Geetha Johri, the officer who headed its investigation team, had been taken off the case for some reasons.

 The state has admitted that its police had killed extortionist Sohrabuddin in a fake encounter in November 2005 after falsely accusing him of plotting to assassinate chief minister Narendra Modi. It has also admitted that Sohrabuddins wife Kauser Bi was later killed and burnt, probably by the police in an effort to cover up the crime.

 The court said the state polices interim report had shown considerable progress in the probe and, therefore, it was giving the government some more time before deciding on a CBI probe.

 The states interim report, placed before the court on April 30, mentions the arrest of three senior police officers, including Modis blue-eyed boy and main suspect D.G. Vanzara.

 The Centre joined Sohrabuddins brother Rubabuddin in seeking a CBI probe, saying there was reason to fear that a state police investigation would not be impartial. The court, which admitted Rubabuddins petition, posted the matter to May 15. The state government opposes a CBI investigation on the ground that it would be used for political gains.

 Some journalists today wrote to the chief justice alleging they that were being stopped from entering the Police Bhavan in Gandhinagar because of adverse media reports on the case.

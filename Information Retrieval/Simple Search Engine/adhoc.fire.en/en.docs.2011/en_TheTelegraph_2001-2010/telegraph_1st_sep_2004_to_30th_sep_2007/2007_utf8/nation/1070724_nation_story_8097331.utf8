 Bias quiz for AIIMS boss 

 New Delhi, July 23: All India Institute of Medical Sciences director P. Venugopal was summoned by the National Scheduled Caste Commission today to explain allegations of caste discrimination at the medical institute, reports our special correspondent. 

 Venugopal was grilled for nearly an hour over complaints of bias, first reported by The Telegraph in June 2006, panel officials said. 

 The latest round of allegations is centred on the selection of senior resident doctors, in which Scheduled Caste candidates have alleged they were deliberately failed. 

 SC/ST students and doctors at AIIMS also met panel chairman Buta Singh, to whom they presented their point of view. Singh assured the students he would take stringent action to end caste discrimination at the institute.

 On a roll: Bharat goes on spending spree

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, April 30: Next time you are about to travel to your orchard-studded native village, dont fret about having to miss that hilarious sitcom or going without chilled beer. Chances are you would have them both.

 A lifestyle revolution is sweeping rural India, where 26 per cent of the households had a TV in 2004, up 7 per cent from 1993-94. And, 4 per cent of them had a fridge, up from 1 per cent. The figures do not rival the big-city spending spree. But they show that villages are joining the party.

 In cities, 32 per cent of the households had a fridge, an increase of more than two-and-a-half times over 12 per cent in 1993-94. An overwhelming 66 per cent of them had a TV. The figures have emerged in a study carried out by the National Sample Survey Organisation. 

 Says Amitabh Tiwari, LG Indias group head (consumer electronics): Improvement in the standard of living, coupled with higher disposable income, has pushed up the sale of consumer goods in rural areas. Better power supply (at least in some states) in several small towns and villages has fuelled purchases. The fall in prices of several models in recent years has enticed buyers, too.

 Prices of colour TVs and refrigerators have fallen over 15-16 per cent in recent years, said Tiwari. Then, TVs themselves have raised aspirations by showing those in villages alluring images of the buy-it-now culture.

 Economists are not surprised, but insist that despite increased consumption, much of rural India is still not shining. Bihar in 1991 had 12 per cent electrification. In 2001, the figure had come down to 10 per cent, says D. Joshi, director and principal economist of Crisil. Joshis concerns are reflected in another section of the survey that says firewood and dung cakes are still the primary source of energy for 75 per cent of rural households. 

 By contrast, cooking gas (LPG) is used by 57 per cent of urban homes. The figure is 69 per cent for salary earners. While power is the main source of lighting, low-income groups and Scheduled Tribes still use kerosene.

 The power problems might worry economists, not the village gadget freak staring longingly at a neighbours plasma TV. And, if he wants it, he can count on easy loans. 

 With consumer goods being one of the most widely accepted measures of standard of living, people in villages are trying to catch up with those in towns, Joshi said. 

 The NSSO also shows a 75 per cent increase in the number of Indians buying readymade, mostly designer, garments, another well-recognised barometer of rising affluence.

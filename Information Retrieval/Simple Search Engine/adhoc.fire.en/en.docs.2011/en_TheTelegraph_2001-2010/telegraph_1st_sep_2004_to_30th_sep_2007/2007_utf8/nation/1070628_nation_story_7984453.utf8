 Amarnath

 Srinagar, June 27: The ice Shivlingam at Amarnath is melting rapidly.

 When the lingam was measured on May 25, its height was 12-and-a-half feet while its circumference was eight feet. It is one-tenth of that (girth) now. It is melting because of a rise in temperature, which will last for at least a week, said M.K. Raina, the director of the shrine board.

 The two-month yatra will begin on June 30.

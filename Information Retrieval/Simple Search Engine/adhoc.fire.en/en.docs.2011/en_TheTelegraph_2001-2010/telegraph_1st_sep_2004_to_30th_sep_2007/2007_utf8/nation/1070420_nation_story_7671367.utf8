 Poll CD hearing blow to BJP

 Navin Chawla: Chair stays

 New Delhi, April 19: The Election Commission today rejected the BJPs demand to keep out Navin Chawla from the hearings on the controversial anti-Muslim CD that has led to calls for the partys de-recognition.

 The poll panel said just because the party had moved the Supreme Court for Chawlas removal on the ground of misconduct did not mean the commissioner would be biased against the BJP.

 The mere pendency of a case cannot lead to the conclusion of existence of bias or apprehension of the same, the commission said in its order signed by all three members.

 Soon after the order, the BJP embarked on an alternative course of action. General secretary Arun Jaitley, a senior lawyer, submitted a letter to the panel arguing that the party be given leave to question the commissions jurisdiction. A judicial body with bias cannot have the power to judge anyone, Jaitley said.

 The submission of the letter means the BJP would appeal against any harsh order on the ground that the commission was biased.

 The BJP then proceeded to present its arguments in the CD case. It cited a 1983 case in which the apex court had held that the commission cannot assume the power to disqualify. Another argument was that members of the commission were political appointees and de-recognising of parties by the panel goes against the constitutional validity of Indias multiparty system.

 The BJP also claimed it had evidence that the CD was not authorised by the party.

 It also cited excerpts from a book, with a preface by chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswamy, which said the panels powers regarding de-recognition were untested.

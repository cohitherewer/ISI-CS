 Music therapy for cancer

 If you thought FM was your entertainment while stuck in traffic, think again. It can deliver more than music.

 The Sehgals had already spent Rs 3,50,000, and were planning to sell off their house when Sanchita and Siddhant RJs for Big FMs Panga Hai Par Changa Hai entered the scene.

 The two are part of a scouting team that the channel sends to find people in need. A Help Ashish Campaign was launched on February 23, with RJs punctuating music sessions with appeals to the public to donate for Ashish. 

 By February 27, the date of the surgery, 106 listeners had sent in Rs 2,96,800.

 In Mumbai, too, Big FM had collected Rs 3,00,000 for a three-year-old girl with cancer, and helped an HIV-positive person find accommodation.

 Valley to shed BSF green for khaki

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 27: Encouraged by a year of declining violence in Jammu and Kashmir, the Centre has decided to remove the last traces of the unpopular olive green from the Valley.

 Between March 15 and 22, the 10 remaining Border Security Force (BSF) battalions stationed on the outskirts of Srinagar and in militancy-hit Anantnag, Pulwama and Baramulla will be pulled out.

 They will be replaced with an equal number of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) battalions, who wear khaki.

 The BSF troops will be moved to the Northeast to guard the Bangladesh and Myanmar borders, through which the ISI is exporting terrorism, a senior home ministry official said.

 The change in the colour of uniform worn by those guarding the Valley will definitely give a sense of relief to Kashmiris. Popular perception equates the BSF with the army while the CRPF gives an impression that it is an extension of the police, he added.

 Kashmir observers in the government say that by phasing the BSF out from internal security duties, Delhi will be able to send out the message that conditions in Kashmir are getting better.

 An empowered group of ministers in 2002 had decided that the BSF should be gradually withdrawn from Jammu and Kashmir and replaced by the CRPF.

 Since then, the CRPF has raised 30 battalions. The last lot of 10 battalions is undergoing the final stages of counter-insurgency training..

 Officials say that tourism figures reflect the changed situation in the state. 

 According to the government, over 4.12 lakh domestic visitors and more than 20,000 foreign tourists visited Jammu and Kashmir in 2006. Some 43,000 toured Ladakh.

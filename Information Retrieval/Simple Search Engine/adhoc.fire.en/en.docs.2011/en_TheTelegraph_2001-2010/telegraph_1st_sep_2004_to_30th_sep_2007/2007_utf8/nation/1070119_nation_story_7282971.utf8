 Sanjay surprise

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 18: Actor Sanjay Dutt got another reprieve today but not before an unpleasant surprise.

 The star has been granted time till February 6 to surrender for the sentencing in the 1993 Bombay blasts case in which he has been convicted for possessing arms.

 Minutes after Sanjay arrived at the court, an application questioned why the actor alone, not the other convicted, has been allowed to seek probation. It was moved by a person whose identity has not been disclosed.

 The envelope with the letter, the contents of which were also kept confidential by the court, had three copies one each for the judge, the defence and the prosecution. Sanjays lawyer said the court had to examine if the letter was from an aggrieved party.

 Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam pointed out that the prosecution had already filed a reply opposing the actors probation plea.

 He said that if the court considers the interveners application, it would be inundated with such pleas.

 After reading the application, it appears that he is taking his personal feelings and grievances to the court. As regards the matter concerning accused Number 117 (Sanjay), he has no concern with the intervener and we apprehend that such a thing will open a floodgate, Nikam added.

 Judge Pramod Kode agreed with Nikam and dismissed the application.

 The probation hearing will continue on February 6.

 Good old days but reality bites

 - NAM-era memories come with three rude reminders

 New Delhi, Jan. 29: As Kenneth Kaunda denounced the western alliance against Iraq, some at the satyagraha conference today may have felt a tad surprise at the warmth of the applause from the three others on the podium.

 One of them, Sonia Gandhi, has staunchly backed the Prime Minister through milestone foreign policy events such as the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 The second, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, is following a course set by Manmohan Singh that involved voting against Iran on its nuclear programme.

 The third, A.K. Antony, as defence minister, is committed to a policy of promoting military partnership with Israel.

 Yet, when Zambias founding President called for George W. Bush and Tony Blair to end the Iraq war and advised Israel to approach the Palestine issue with honesty, a wave of nostalgia seemed to sweep over Congress ranks.

 Some even tried to read in the speech a mild nudge to revisit the non-aligned era of the 60s and 70s, although they admitted that the Nehruvian concept was unworkable in a unipolar world.

 The party, however, dismissed the suggestion that Kaundas denunciations could embarrass the government.

 Devendra Dwivedi, designated spokesman for the conference on Peace, non-violence and empowerment: Gandhian philosophy in the 21st century, said: Kaunda is one of the greatest men walking on the planet. He belongs to a genre, he can speak of his own experience. But comment from distinguished persons will not affect our bilateral relations (with the US and Israel). We have an open mind.

 If Sonias address sought largely to anchor Gandhis political philosophy and ideals in the here and now, those of Kaunda and Nasser al Kidwa, former Palestinian foreign minister, were throwbacks to past decades.

 The 83-year-old Kaunda, a friend of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, has been living in virtual exile in Boston after he lost the 1991 elections and allegedly attempted an aborted coup in 1997. He spoke of how military campaigns always failed.

 No one with a sense of humanity can stand the sickening devastation being witnessed on TV, he said. Say no to governments to send their young ones to war to glorify themselves.

 Very much the elder statesman, Kaunda stressed that the West Asia crisis particularly the Palestine-Israel conflict should be sympathetically addressed. The conflict is at the core of terrorism in West Asia and unless it is resolved, the polity will continue to be radicalised.

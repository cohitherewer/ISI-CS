 Pentagon tries to allay Prakash fears

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: The Indo-US military relationship has gathered its own momentum and is de-linked from the civilian nuclear deal, a senior Pentagon policy-maker for South Asia said here today.

 There is no masterplan to lure India (into a military alliance); there is no grand design for India, said James Clad, the deputy assistant secretary of defence for South and Southeast Asia. 

 We are not setting out some strategic blueprint and want that other countries will join in a subservient role, he said.

 CPM general secretary Prakash Karat has repeatedly stated while opposing the 123 Agreement that India was being drawn into a military alliance with the US. The 123 deal is part of an agenda that Washington has drafted for New Delhi and India risked giving up its independent foreign policy by allying with the US, Karat and Left leaders say, justifying their opposition.

 When US envoy David Mulford said in Delhi on Tuesday that India and the US need to graduate their relationship from 123 to 456 his coinage for a wider and more intensive partnership the Left felt it confirmed their suspicions. 

 But Clad emphasised that the military relations were independent of the fate of the nuclear deal.

 He was answering questions from former diplomats and retired military generals, including former Indian ambassador to Washington, Lalit Mansingh, and ambassadors K. Raghunath and Dilip Lahiri, Lt Gen. V.G. Patankar and Major General Ashok Mehta at the Observer Research Foundation, a think-tank here. 

 The session turned into a quiz on the India-US military relationship, two days after Mulford said that time was of the essence in clinching the nuclear deal.

 Mulfords remarks annoyed the Left that interpreted them as a diktat on the timeline set by the Bush administration for the Manmohan Singh government. Clad said the defence relationship between India and the US evolved before the nuclear deal. It was not dependent on the Bush and Manmohan Singh administrations and was likely to outlive both of them, he said.

 (I think it is important to) get away from this idea of interference and move cautiously into seeing what are overlapping interests. We should look at overlapping sources of concern the world over and see where we can work together, Clad said. 

 The senior Pentagon official said interoperability between militaries was a policy that the US pursued the world over. 

 Officials from the US embassy and the Pentagon accompanying Clad said a Logistics Support Agreement that was pending with the Indian Cabinet Committee on Security was designed to move from currency-exchange to commodity-exchange in military relations. 

 This meant that each side would be able to supply the other with fuel and logistics during common military engagements.

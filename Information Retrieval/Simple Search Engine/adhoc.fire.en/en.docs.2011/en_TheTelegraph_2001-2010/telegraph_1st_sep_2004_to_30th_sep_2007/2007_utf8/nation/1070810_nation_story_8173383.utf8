 Pratibha, husband tend Kalam legacy

 MANDIRA NAYAR

 Devisingh Shekhawat

 New Delhi, Aug. 9: A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has left but a part of his legacy lives on at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 His herbal garden, to start with, has found a new protector in First Gentleman Devisingh Shekhawat, a botanist.

 He is extremely interested in the gardens of Rashtrapati Bhavan, especially the herbal gardens, an official said.

 Shekhawat seems less happy with the security forced on him, and the President herself new to the elaborate protocol that comes with the job seems to be trying hard to be accessible.

 Kalam, who had thrown Rashtrapati Bhavans doors open and made it a Peoples Bhavan, should be a tough act to follow but Pratibha tai is carrying on the tradition.

 Its still a peoples place: she is accessible, the official said.

 A group of people from her village in Maharashtra, who were in town, decided to just drop in. She met them.

 While Kalam had his cosy chats with students, Patils field of interest is the empowerment of women.

 The first woman President has been in touch with womens groups, now meeting state womens commission officials, now asking the Confederation of Rural NGOs to work for the uplift of village women.

 Her husband has had a little more difficulty fitting in. Shekhawat appears slightly uncomfortable with constant protection, but officials insist that it is part of protocol.

 Weve looked up the blue book. He is entitled to a separate saloon car on a train. He is not using this at the moment and insists on travelling by the usual air-conditioned first-class, the official said.

 Preferring to stick to his image of an ordinary man, Shekhawat chose not to stay in Raj Bhavan during his Maharashtra trip.

 Protocol demands that as the spouse of the President, he is treated as a state guest, the official said.

 But he stayed with his son. Rashtrapati Bhavan, however, had to ensure that all the conventions were followed.

 Agni set to fire again

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 11: India is likely to test its most powerful long-range missile, the Agni III, tomorrow morning, a high-level defence ministry source said. 

 The only other test of the missile in July last year was unsuccessful.

 The Defence Research and Development Organisation had announced after the failure of the first test that it had sorted out the glitch in the two-stage missile. 

 On July 9 last year, the Agni III had lifted off but a technical problem had thwarted the separation of the first stage (launch and lift-off) and the second stage (propulsion and guidance). The missile fell into the sea after taking off from Wheelers Island off the Orissa coast.

 The Agni III not only demonstrates advancement in missile technology for India but also has diplomatic import. Its 3,000-km-plus range brings many cities in southern China within its reach.

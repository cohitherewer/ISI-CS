 Shilpa Long Legs steals star-studded show

 Sheffield, June 10: One could see why they say she has the longest legs in the business. Last night at a packed 12,500-seat Sheffield Hallam Arena in Yorkshire, Shilpa Shetty, Britains own Bollywood girl, lit up the IIFA awards ceremony by dancing like never before. 

 In shimmering white skin-tight trousers into which she had been poured for one act and a choli and gaghra outfit which revealed acres of bare midriff for another, the actress wiggled her hips and everything that could be wiggled for herself, for the Indian film fraternity, for her parents, who were present and whom she said she loved dearly, and for Mother India. 

 After that, though there were many other emotional highs Dharmendra getting together with Amitabh Bachchan to recall the shooting of Sholay and then summoning his weeping boys, Sunny and Bobby, on stage; Amitabh dancing with Abhishek; Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar driving the girls wild; Aishwarya, rather surprisingly, choosing not to dance but coming on to collect a prize for being the most glamorous star of 2006; Bipasha Basu doing her Im dripping with sex numbers; and Saif Ali Khan opening the envelope and finding the winners name was that of his sister, Soha Ali Khan, to his great surprise but no one elses Shilpas act, by common consent, was the outstanding offering on what the British media have dubbed the Bollywood equivalent of the Oscars. 

 Shilpa was given an award by the man who is probably the best-known Yorkshireman in the world Geoffrey Boycott. The countys former opening batsman, now turned commentator, was commendably brief and frank: Over 10 years ago, I met her at Delhi Golf Club and fell in love with her. Ive been her biggest fan. 

 Under great provocation on Celebrity Big Brother, the reality television show where she was subjected to much abuse, Shilpa had acted throughout with dignity, he also pointed out. He had continued to love her (like a brother, he implied). 

 Boycott got a brief brush on the cheeks from Shilpa, though a television replay of the snickometer might suggest there had not been any contact.

 She then played unashamedly to the gallery: East or West, Yorkshire is best. 

 The girl has also learnt to do self-deprecation, a quality much beloved of the British but largely unknown among Indians. 

 Picking up her IIFA award and realising she had stirred even elderly men with her performance, she remarked: I wish I was this good in my movies. 

 Earlier, the traditional red carpet was replaced by a green carpet to indicate IIFAs new best friend is the environmental organisation, Global Cool. For over two hours, the cheering fans and the media were kept busy to focus on one arrival and then ignore that person if someone more important arrived. 

 Amitabh came holding his granddaughter by the hand; newly weds Abhishek and Aishwarya (she wore a pink, lengha ensemble) got a warm reception; Bipasha dared to bare; Shilpa came in a green outfit to show she was friendly to the environment and to the photographers (her top would get the moral police in India hot and bothered); Konkona Sen Sharma had put on what looked like a Banarasi sari; Preity Zinta, who came with boyfriend Ness Wadia, wore yellow; and Soha Ali Khan looked fresh and pretty in a cream dress. 

 It was an excellent turnout by the Indian film fraternity: Arjun Rampal, Arshad Warsi; Lara Dutta and Boman Irani (who compered the evening, the former by reading, a trifle woodenly, from an autocue); Hrithik Roshan came with his glowing tan and his father Rakesh; Karan Johar with his easy quips; Kabir Bedi, in white, with a new woman wrapped around him; Anil Kapoor, in big glasses and bigger quiff; Aftab Shivdasani; Katrika Kaif; Ramesh Sippy; Uppen Patel (who comes from London); Randhir Kapoor; Deepa Mehta (who was honoured for being Deepa Mehta and bringing honour to India all over the world for Earth, Fire and now Water); and assorted starlets and would-be starlets. 

 Only Shah Rukh Khan was missing. 

 Rang De Basanti won five awards, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress and Best Musical Direction. 

 Omkara also did well. 

 Its director, Rakeysh Mehra, commented, when winning one of the awards: 2006 has been a landmark year for Indian cinema and this award is much more special when you know it is among great films. 2006 belongs to a changing time in Indian cinema. 

 Hrithik picked up Best Actor for Krrish, while Rani Mukerji was Best Actress for Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna. 

 The British heartthrob Colin Firth (Mr Darcy in the TV adaptation of Pride and Prejudice and a character with the same name in Bridget Joness Diary) was one of the English celebrities who attended. 

 This is all new to me, he confessed.

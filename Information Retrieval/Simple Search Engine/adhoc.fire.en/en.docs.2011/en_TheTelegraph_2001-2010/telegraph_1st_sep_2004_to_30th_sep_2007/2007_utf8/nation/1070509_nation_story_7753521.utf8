 Double transplant gives boy new life

 New Delhi, May 8: Fifteen-year-old Ganesh Nehru, battling for life a month ago with a defective liver and failed kidneys, is now looking forward to returning to school in San Jose, California, after a medical feat by Delhi doctors. 

 Doctors at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital today claimed they had performed the worlds first double transplant from living donors, giving Ganesh a palm-sized chunk of liver from his uncle and a whole kidney taken from his mother. 

 The transplant team that extracted the kidney and liver from the donors and transplanted them into the boy in an 18-hour operation on April 17 today said the boy is ready to be discharged.

 I feel great... and would like to get back to school as soon as I can, said Ganesh, who was in the ninth grade at the Yerba Buma High School in San Jose where his father is a software engineer when his life-threatening condition was diagnosed. 

 The Nehrus were on a trip to Tirupati last year when intractable vomiting prompted doctors to suggest a series of tests that revealed he had a condition called primary hyperoxaluria a rare condition that occurs only in one in 60,000 to 120,000 births. 

 Unknown to Ganesh, he was born with a liver that could not break down a compound called oxalate which enters the body through certain foods. The oxalate combines with calcium to produce kidney stones that had been gradually destroying his kidneys. 

 When he came to us, his kidneys had completely failed he had to be put on dialysis right away, said Neelam Mohan, a paediatric gastroenterologist who was part of the team. 

 With a defective liver, a new kidney would have been subject to the same assault by oxalate, said Dr A.S. Soin, a transplant surgeon. A double transplant was the only option. 

 While similar twin transplants from cadaveric (brain dead) donors have been performed abroad, the lack of cadavers for transplants forced the team to look for living donors. 

 The procedure was a lot more challenging than transplants involving organs from cadavers because this required major and simultaneous surgery on three persons, said Soin. 

 Doctors said the procedure cost Rs 19 lakh, a price tag much lower than what the family would have had to pay for a similar operation in the US. 

 Senior gastrointestinal surgeon Samiran Nundy said the procedure showed that India had caught up with perhaps even surpassed some western countries in liver transplants, which are among the most risky and complicated surgical procedures.

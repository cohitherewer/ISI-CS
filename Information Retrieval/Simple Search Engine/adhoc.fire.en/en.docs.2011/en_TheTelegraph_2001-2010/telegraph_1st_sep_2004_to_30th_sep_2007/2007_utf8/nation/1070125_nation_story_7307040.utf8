 Leopards at door strike fear in Valley 

 MUZAFFAR RAINA 

 Cat capers

 Mahin (Tangmarg), Jan. 24: Abdul Hameed Mir will not forget that night easily. 

 Six leopards descended from the adjoining forest and spent hours roaming around his house, growling and apparently baying for the familys blood. 

 Seven days after the incident, Mirs family and the others in this village of less than a dozen families live in fear. 

 It was around six in the evening. They came through the main road, which leads to Gulmarg, said Mir, a government employee. 

 Some of us were outdoors. When we heard their roar, we rushed home, bolted the doors and put off the candles. But the roars kept growing louder. 

 Inside, the men waited with bated breath for the animals to make their next move, pick-axes in hand.

 Late in the night, we saw them heading towards Ferozpora village, said Mir. 

 To make sure that the leopards were leaving the village, the residents followed their footsteps on snow till they went beyond Mahin. 

 That was the last time they ventured out in the dark. We still do not step out of home in the evenings, Mir said.

 No human being has been attacked at Mahin or Ferozpora but over 50 dogs were killed in the past few months, said Muneer Ahmad, a villager. 

 A boy was killed in adjoining Banji village, though. 

 Last weeks incident was exceptional because of the sheer size of the pack. Earlier, one or two leopards would occasionally appear here but so many at a time a villager could not complete the sentence.

 Man-animal encounters have become frequent in the Valley of late with the green cover shrinking and thousands of villages bordering forests live in perpetual fear.

 In south Kashmirs Shangus village, three children were mauled to death earlier this month. The authorities constituted seven police teams to hunt down the maneater leopards. 

 Officials said 15 people and around a dozen animals, including black bears and leopards, were killed last year but the actual number could be more. In addition, several hundred people were injured in the past year. 

 Police killed three black bears at Batapora on the outskirts of Srinagar last month as many people looked on, an official said. 

 The government denied the incident. I have no information about it, said wildlife warden Farooq Geelani. 

 The killing of black bears and leopards is punishable but for in extreme cases, when they are declared maneaters. 

 The Wildlife Authority of India sent a delegation to the Valley last month to ascertain the real reasons behind the surge in animal killings. 

 The death of a black bear in south Kashmir s Tral area prompted their visit. The bear was set ablaze. 

 The government attributes the rise in these incidents to shrinking habitats of wild animals, spread of human settlements and decimation of forest cover. 

 Also, because of the complete ban on hunting and fur trade in the state since 1997, the animals have got better protection. No census of leopards or black bears has been conducted but their frequent sightings indicate a rise in numbers, forest minister Qazi Mohammad Afzal said.

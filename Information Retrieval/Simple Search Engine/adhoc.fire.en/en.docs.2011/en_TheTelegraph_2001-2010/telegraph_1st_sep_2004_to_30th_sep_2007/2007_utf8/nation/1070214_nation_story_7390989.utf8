 No to ragging? Students dont agree

 ANANYA SENGUPTA

 Akhilesh Shukla, 17, a student of BJ Medical College in Pune, was hospitalised on August 28, 2006, with renal problems following alleged ragging by seniors 

 Rohit Vijay Rane, a Mumbai boy studying in Chiplun, 240 km from Mumbai,was assaulted by seniors in September.

 Mumbai, Feb. 13: All does not seem well with Mumbais college students who, despite many cases of reported ragging, still cannot draw the line between friendly introductions and a campus evil.

 Today, hundreds of them gathered at Mumbais SNDT College to be part of a discussion initiated by the Raghavan Committee on ragging. The panel will submit its findings in the Supreme Court.

 Parents told horrific stories about how their children refused to go back to college after being ragged. There were students who spoke of how they were ragged.

 But none said ragging should be stopped. 

 Garima Advani, a fresher in TN Medical College, said she was ragged mildly. Introduction to the seniors shouldnt be called ragging, she said, then confessed she had cried when she was ragged. But its more emotional than physical. Now I am friends with my seniors.

 R.K. Raghavan, the former CBI director heading the panel, could not help laughing at her obvious lack of knowledge. So, you will rag your juniors when they come in? he asked. Why did you cry when they asked you to dance in public? Its ragging when a senior asks you to do something by force.

 Some interns detailed the reasons why ragging persists. There is a north India-Maharashtra divide. Students who come from there think themselves to be outsiders. They dont mix with the others, said Ritika Chhawchharia, a second-year student of TN Medical College who stays in the college hostel. This regional bias is one of the most serious reasons why ragging still persists.

 Then there are those who cant speak English. They are the obvious victims of ragging, Ritika said.

 She also thinks a little bit of ragging is good. But she cant define how little or how much is that little bit. 

 The panel agreed that it found students from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Punjab more prone to ragging others. Those from Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala were found to be more disciplined.

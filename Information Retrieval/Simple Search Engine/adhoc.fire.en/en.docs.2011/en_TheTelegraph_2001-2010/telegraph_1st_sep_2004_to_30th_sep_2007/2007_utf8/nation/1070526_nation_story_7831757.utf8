 Harkat suspect in blast net

 OUR BUREAU

 Hyderabad/Mumbai, May 25: A 52-year-old meat vendor who is suspected to have supplied the RDX for last weeks Mecca Masjid blast has been arrested in Maharashtras Jalna town.

 A Hyderabad police team picked up Shoaib Jagirdar, said to be one of the six Harkat-ul Jehadi Islami sleepers who entered India from Bangladesh with explosives in the first week of March.

 Shoaib is the fourth of them to be taken in custody, after two were held in Jamshedpur earlier this week and one in Calcutta, Intelligence Bureau sources said.

 But police in Bengal and Calcutta have denied taking anyone in custody in connection with the Hyderabad mosque blast that killed 11 worshippers after Friday prayers on May 18.

 Andhra Pradesh last night asked the Centre to order a CBI probe into the blast, claiming the arrests were definite proof of foreign terrorists involvement.

 Maharashtra police remained tight-lipped about Shoaibs arrest. A suspect has been arrested, but it was a Hyderabad police operation. Only they can speak about it, anti-terrorist squad chief K.P. Raghuvanshi said. 

 The IB sources in Hyderabad said police and intelligence officials in five states Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, Andhra and Karnataka were on the lookout for the two remaining Harkat sleepers.

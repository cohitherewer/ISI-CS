 Police claim on Atwal accident under strain 

 K.P.NAYAR

 Washington, March 12: A case against Arjun Atwal, which the Florida police was enthusiastically building during the weekend following a high-speed accident near the golfers home in Windermere, appeared to have hit some roadblocks today.

 Florida highway patrol spokeswoman Kim Millers assertion on Saturday that Atwal was racing his 2006 BMW sedan against John Parks 2006 Mercedes convertible causing Parks death came under strain today after the Indian golfers management company insisted Park and Atwal did not know each other.

 Like Atwal, Park, 48, lived in Windermere. He was of Korean descent and owned a video production business in Orange county. 

 A statement issued by Robert Kreusler, president and chief executive officer of Atwals management company Blue Giraffe Sports, following Millers conversation with the media said: Arjun, his wife Sona and the remainder of his family extend their deepest condolences to the family of Mr John N. Park.

 It added: Even though Arjun and his family did not know Mr Park, they cannot fathom the unimaginable pain that his family must be going through. Their constant thoughts and prayers are with the Park family at this time.

 Kreusler said Atwal was very keen to place his side of the story before the media but is unable to do so in the light of the continuing investigation by the Florida highway patrol into the accident. 

 We ask that members of the press and the public do not rush to make a judgement about what occurred here, because once all of the facts have been gathered and the investigation completed, it will be abundantly clear that this was simply a horrible accident and tragedy, with no one at fault.

 In an implicit acknowledgement that that they had no open-and-shut case against Atwal, Florida highway patrol officials told the local media after Kreuslers statement that their investigation could take up to two months.

 This is a little bit of new territory because there was no contact made with Atwals car by the vehicle driven by the deceased, Miller acknowledged to the Orlando Sentinel. Nor could she back up claims that the two men were racing by providing any concrete facts other than vague claims by unidentified witnesses. 

 Meanwhile, opinion within the golfing fraternity appeared to be emerging in support of Atwal. Ty Votaw, executive vice-president for communications and international affairs at PGA Tour, the Florida-based organisation of professional golfers, said: Until we learn more, we dont have any comment at this time. 

 There was speculation yesterday that the organisation may impose sanctions on Atwal because of the accident.

 Fellow PGA golfer Daniel Chopra was quoted on the PGA Tours website as saying his wife had spoken to Atwals wife about the incident.

 Obviously, it was horrible it happened, Chopra, who was born in Sweden, but grew up in India, said. I hope people wont think he (Atwal) is somebody who caused the accident. He is a good driver. It was shocking. 

 He was quoted in the Orlando Sentinel today: You have some motorists that came out and made statements saying, Oh, they were racing. But you have some old people driving 45 miles per hour and if you do 60, they might seem like, Oh, my God, it is a rocket ship. It is all a matter of perspective. We will have to find out what happens. I dont think it is as serious as maybe the first report.

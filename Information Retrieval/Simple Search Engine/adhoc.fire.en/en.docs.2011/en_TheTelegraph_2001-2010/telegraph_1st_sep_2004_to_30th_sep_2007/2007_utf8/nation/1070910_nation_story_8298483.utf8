 Hyderabad, Sept. 9: A realtor died of bullet injury at the home of the Andhra Pradesh Congress chiefs son today.

 Prashant Reddy, who was reportedly involved in a property dispute with K. Kesava Raos son Venkat, was hit on his right temple at the posh Prashasan Nagar house at 4pm. He later died in Apollo Hospital.

 It appears to be a case of suicide. However, we want a fair and honest inquiry to bring out the truth, Rao said after visiting the hospital. But Reddys relatives suspected foul play.

 Venkat was also admitted to the hospital.

 Reddy and Venkat, partners in real estate business, recently developed differences over a plot in Ranga Reddy district.

 Police remained tightlipped while the Opposition Telugu Desam alleged that the government was trying to shield Raos son.

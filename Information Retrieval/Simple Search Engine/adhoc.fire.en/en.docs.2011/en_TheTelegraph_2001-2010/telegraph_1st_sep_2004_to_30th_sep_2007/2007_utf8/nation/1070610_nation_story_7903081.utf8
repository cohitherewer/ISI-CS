 Army in Kerala for virus combat

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, June 9: Army medical teams today moved into Kerala to help contain an outbreak of chikungunya as the states famed healthcare system appeared to have collapsed before the marauding virus, which has already killed 36.

 Units from the Armed Force Medical College in Pune and army medical corps personnel from Hyderabad, Secunderabad and Chennai were headed for the worst-hit districts of Kottayam and Pathanamthitta following a directive from defence minister A.K. Antony. This is the first time that the army has been called in to tackle a health problem in the state. 

 Antony had last night received a virtual SOS from state health minister P.K. Sreemathy, who feared the situation could take a turn for the worse with the onset of the south-west monsoon.

 So far, 122 people have been affected, the health department has confirmed, while nearly 7,000 are suspected to have contracted the highly infectious disease that appears to have swamped the states healthcare system, known for its promptness.

 Symptoms of the disease, which is spread by mosquitoes but does not spread from human to human, are fever, sudden and severe headache, chill, joint and muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and rashes. 

 An all-party meeting here today decided on a weeklong sanitation drive from June 12 against different types of viral fevers lashing the state in periodic cycles.

 Last year, over 100 people had died in a suspected outbreak of chikungunya but the government maintained that the disease was not the primary cause of the deaths.

 This time, chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan has confirmed that 36 people have died in Kottayam and Pathanamthitta since January. Seven districts have confirmed the disease.

 Bikers chase Katrina

 Aug. 26: Katrina Kaif was tailed by youths speeding dangerously on motorcycles when she landed in Jodhpur to meet boyfriend Salman Khan today.

 The actor, whom Katrina had seen off at Mumbai airport yesterday, spent a sleepless first night in prison. He is serving a five-year term for killing a chinkara, an endangered animal, in 1998.

 Jail sources said Salman, who has been tagged prisoner No. 343, read a novel to kill time last night and avoided interaction with other inmates.

 Katrina arrived in the city with Salmans siblings Arbaaz, Alvira and Arpita and sister-in-law Malaika. 

 Fans who had wildly cheered the actor outside the jail yesterday followed their car today from the airport to Taj Hari Mahal Hotel, and then again when the group left for the prison around 2.45pm.

 At least six to eight youths skidded off their motorcycles as they recklessly revved up to keep pace with the car. If any bones were broken, no one was complaining.

 As Katrina went inside with Arbaaz and Alvira to meet Salman, the fans kept chanting the actors name and shouting slogans demanding his release. 

 Jail authorities bent rules to allow the meeting, which lasted 30 minutes. Under the rules, relatives can meet prisoners only between 9am and 11am on Sundays. Todays meeting took place between 3pm and 4pm.

 One rule was followed, though: not more than three persons were allowed to meet him. So, Malaika and Arpita stayed back in the hotel with Salmans bodyguard Shera, who had accompanied the actor and his other brother Sohail to Jodhpur yesterday.

 Salman is being held in barrack number one, where his cellmate is lifer Mahesh Sharma. The two had become friends during his last jail stint.

 After a breakfast of chana and tea, the actor was examined this morning by a medical team, which found him fit. 

 He may have to spend more nights in jail. Salmans revision plea against the five-year jail term is expected to come up for hearing in Rajasthan High Court on Monday, but any bail may not come through before Wednesday.

 New Delhi, June 5: Sonia Gandhi is hitting the lecture circuit, so far a favourite and lucrative destination for western politicians put out to pasture.

 The Congress president, who does not meet the usual out-of-work criterion, will be in the Netherlands on June 9 to address a think-tank, the Nexus Institute.

 The topic does justice to her current preoccupation Living politics: What India has taught me.

 The Congress president spent much of today refining her speech.

 The Nexus Institute is located in Tilburg, 100 km to the south of Amsterdam. 

 An official said this was the first time that a non-western politician has been invited to speak. Amartya Sen is the only other Indian to have been invited.

 We were interested in her personal life as well as political career because she has a long family tradition and a rich intellectual heritage, the official said.

 The institute pays a fee to speakers. I cant make any comment on the exact fee, the official added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Reliance door open, just

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 1: Reliances retail venture planned in a city market lived to fight another day as a meeting of the Left Front today kept the option open.

 The CPMs allies had opposed the proposal of Reliance conducting retail business from the Park Circus market, for which the company won the redevelopment contract. 

 The allies cited at the meeting CPM general secretary Prakash Karats prescription of a tough licensing system to prevent corporate monopoly in retail to argue their point, much to the chagrin of the mayor, Bikash Bhattacharya, and other CPM leaders.

 CPI leader Prabir Deb said: The mayor assured us that Reliances role would be limited to redeveloping the market. We have no objection to public-private partnership as long as Reliance does not start selling vegetables or consumer items.

 But Rabin Deb, of the CPM, denied having given any assurance to bar Reliance entry into retail. We unanimously decided to pave the way for discussion in the mayor-in-council on the market development, he said.

 This means that the next meeting of the Calcutta Municipal Corporations mayor-in-council a week from now is expected to approve Reliance redeveloping the market under a 99-year lease.

 Bhattacharya told the allies that Reliance would have to seek a separate licence to open a retail outlet. So as long as it does not apply for the licence, the question of whether or not it should be given the permission is irrelevant.

 Under the contract, Reliance can retain about 1.5 lakh sq ft out of around 2.6 lakh sq ft for commercial purposes, defined as markets, multiplexes, restaurants, entertainment hubs, and for any other purpose as mutually agreed upon by the CMC and the private partner.

 There is nothing in the terms that prohibits Reliance from using the space for a retail venture, CMC sources said.

 Deb said: If Reliance seeks the licence to do retail business in the market, it will be decided according to the Left Fronts policy on retail.

 The expectation is that by the time Reliance completes redeveloping the market in two-three years, a national policy on corporate entry in retail will be in place. We will apply the rules accordingly, CPM leaders quoted the mayor as saying.

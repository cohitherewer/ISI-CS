 US bike for mango bite

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Trade with US to get faster and sweeter

 New Delhi, April 13: Bikes for mangoes trade between India and the US promises to get faster and sweeter.

 Indian bike lovers will soon be able to zoom on Harley-Davidson while US fruit lovers will be able to bite into the sun-kissed Alphonso mangoes.

 Indications that trade between the two countries could soon hit the fast lane came from a meeting of the India-US Trade Policy Forum where commerce minister Kamal Nath held talks with US trade representative Susan Schwab. We will soon issue a notification on imports of the premium bike, said Nath. 

 Schwab responded by suggesting that Indian mangoes, which havent made it to the US in 18 years, are only a few days away from shipment. The US had banned mangoes from India on concerns of too much pesticide. 

 Now, radiation will be used to kill pests, helping the mangoes make the grade under US food rules. A radiation-testing unit is being set up in Mumbai by both countries.

 The deal to allow mangoes back into the US was reached during President George W. Bushs visit to India last year. Now, the details are being worked out.

 Although bikes in India have to meet the Euro-IV norms, Harley-Davidson might have to conform to the less stringent Euro III. We have indications that India will accept Euro III standards for heavy motorcycles, said Schwab. 

 There is no agreement on import duty, though. Schwab only said a reduction in tariffs will boost trade in automobiles.

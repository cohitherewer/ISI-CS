 Curbs on angioplasty without bypass back-up

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi, Feb. 20: New guidelines for performing angioplasty in hospitals without facilities for back-up bypass surgery may require some hospitals in India to revise their existing practices, doctors said today. 

 The guidelines, finalised by a nine-member panel of experts from Australia, India, the UK and the US, recommend certain restrictions on angioplasty in hospitals that lack on-site back-up facilities for emergency bypass surgery. 

 Under the new guidelines released this week, doctors who perform angioplasty in hospitals without on-site bypass surgery back-up should perform a minimum of 100 angioplasty procedures per year, including 18 emergency procedures. And only doctors who have previous experience of at least 500 angioplasty procedures elsewhere will be able to begin performing the procedure in a clinic that lacks on-site surgery facilities.

 The new guidelines are highly relevant to India where about half of new cardiac care centres that offer angioplasty do not have back-up on-site surgery, said Ashok Seth, chief cardiologist at the Max Devki Devi Heart and Vascular Institute in New Delhi, and member of the expert team set up by the international Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions.

 We believe many institutions in India that currently do not meet the requirements that are outlined in these guidelines will need to change their practices, Seth told The Telegraph. 

 Doctors estimate that at least 50,000 patients in India undergo angioplasty a procedure in which a blockage in an artery is removed with the help of a catheter, a tiny balloon, and stents each year. For many patients, an angioplasty is an alternative to cardiac bypass surgery although cardiologists point out that both procedures have benefits and risks. 

 While India has about 200 hospitals that provide angioplasty, cardiologists estimate that only about 100 possess on-site facilities for bypass surgery. Angioplasty without back-up surgery has been a highly controversial issue among doctors worldwide because a tiny proportion of patients undergoing angioplasty may require an emergency bypass operation.

 The new guidelines, doctors said, are designed to strike a balance between making available angioplasty widely and ensuring that only well-experienced cardiologists perform the procedures.

 If we become highly rigid with guidelines, we may not be able to provide angioplasty in smaller towns, said Tarlochan Kler, director of the cardiac catheterisation lab at the Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre in New Delhi.

 The guidelines also specify that hospitals lacking on-site surgery should have an ambulance on stand-by for transfer to a hospital with surgical facilities within a two-hour distance. The surgeon at an off-site centre should have prior knowledge of the patient and be available for emergency surgery even though the need for such surgery is rare. 

 One senior doctor, however, cautioned that ideally all planned angioplasty procedures in India should be done in facilities with surgery back-ups. Our situation in India is quite different from the West transfers from one hospital to another in traffic could take long, said Suman Bhandari, director of research at the Escorts Heart Institute.

 We need to encourage potentially life-saving emergency angioplasty in rural areas but, I think, planned angioplasty should be restricted only to centres with bypass surgery back-up, he said.

 Bye Wagah, hello Attari

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 OLD RITUAL, NEW NAME

 Chandigarh, Sept. 9: The Wagah border will now be called the Attari border.

 The move follows the Centres acceptance of the Punjab governments proposal for the change of name. 

 The Government of India has changed the name of Wagah border, near Amritsar, to Attari border with immediate effect, the state government said in a release.

 Wagah is a village in Pakistan while Attari is in India. Sixty years ago, they stood somewhere in the middle of the 48km-distance between Amritsar and Lahore.

 Both villages had witnessed millions cross over to either side during Partition, but a signboard hurriedly put up to declare Wagah as a joint checkpost earned the village the status of an international border checkpoint between the two countries. 

 The checkpost has now become a place for celebrating the sovereignty of both nations with an impressive retreat ceremony every evening that marks the closure of gates at the international border.

 Armed soldiers once enacted a hostile parade while lowering their respective flags to the sound of bugles. The hostility has lessened over the past few years the soldiers now shake hands at the end of the ritual.

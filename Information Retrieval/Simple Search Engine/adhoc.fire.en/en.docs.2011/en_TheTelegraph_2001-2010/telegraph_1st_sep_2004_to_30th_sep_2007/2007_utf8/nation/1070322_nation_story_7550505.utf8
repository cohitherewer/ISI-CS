 Buzz in Big Cities 

 TV plea in jail to fight stress

 A Mumbai don serving life imprisonment in Tihar jail has approached Delhi High Court to be allowed a TV in his cell. 

 The demand is urgent, Subhash Thakur says in his petition, as he is depressed, and the World Cup might help lift his spirits. Thakur, also facing trial for conspiring with Sher Singh Rana in murdering Phoolan Devi, has a report prepared by jail doctors prescribing TV. 

 The report says the don suffers from mild anxiety and depression brought on by prolonged isolation... which can be controlled by social and recreational activities. Thakurs counsel D.B. Goswami says jail authorities had, in fact, provided his client a TV, but took it back after other inmates raised a similar demand. 

 So, will authorities consider allowing others to troop into Thakurs cell to watch the Cup? Not a chance, comes the reply from director-general (prisons) B.K. Gupta.

 In any case, the question is whether the don will still risk a depression by watching Dravids boys stoop on the field.

 Heads lost in helmet row

 In Karnataka, helmets have long been strapped to politics. MLAs hold dharnas against the rule. Now, even chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy isnt too happy enforcing a court-ordered rule making the headgear mandatory.

 He has a reason. His father, H.D. Deve Gowda, had scrapped the helmet rule as chief minister, apparently because it was unpopular. The JD(S) coalition, in power now, is toying with the idea of going down the same road. 

 But doctors, particularly neuro-surgeons, who have had to wage many life-and-death wars for accident victims, are worried. 

 After Gowda senior made the rule optional, fatal accidents involving two-wheeler riders increased. It took a nudge from the high court to make helmets a must since last November. But with the chief minister hinting at a relook, the anti-helmet lobby has hit the fast lane. The reasons not to strap on the life-saver are many dandruff, falling hair and receding hairline. True, thats not a small worry but only if your head is safe.

 Concrete gains

 Property prices in Chennai are hitting the roof. Early this month, 11 acres of prime land owned by Hindustan Teleprinters in the citys south went for a whopping Rs 298 crore. 

 Employees opposed to the deal moved Madras High Court, but the legal hurdle is hardy a damper for those wishing to scoop up prized plots.

 The boom has also reached Greater Chennai, where the market grapevine has it that Reliance is on the prowl for prime properties ahead of a massive expansion planned in Reliance Fresh, the firms retail chain.

 Also believed to be on block is Dasaprakash Hotel, a landmark that evokes a sense of nostalgia among Bengalis visiting the city. The buzz is that Reliance is already in talks with the hotel group. The company is keeping everything under wraps. It fears disclosures will drive up prices further. 

 Drama duel

 This was one drama that didnt win an applause, but provoked a case of almost epic proportions over plagiarism charges.

 The Iskcon temple was recently asked by Delhi High Court to pay Rs 50,000 to settle allegations that it copied Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra Ram Lila during Navratri festival last year. 

 The Kendra, one of the citys famous cultural centres, will spend the money on charity, including mid-day meals in schools.

 The temple and organisers of the Ram Leela show were accused of stealing the script and reproducing the dance drama without prior permission. They were also charged with luring the Kendras former artistes to play lead roles.

 Table tennis champion to President hopeful 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 14: Small-town lawyer, minister, Opposition leader, governor and now President hopeful Pratibha Patil has come a long way from a college table tennis champ.

 And if she does win the race, the first woman governor of Rajasthan would also be the first to break the male dominance at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 The silent and low-profile 72-year-old, a Rajput from Maharashtra, is an experienced politician and an administrator, but fellow party leaders in her home state said they were in a state of shock.

 We are all shocked by the development. We dont know how her name emerged in the frontline. Perhaps, Soniaji wanted a low-profile, non-controversial non-entity to be the candidate, a senior Congress leader said.

 Born in Jalgaon on December 19, 1934, Patil completed her MA at MJ College and went on to complete her LLB from Government Law College in Mumbai. During her college days, she was known as a champion table tennis player.

 Patil practised as a lawyer in Jalgaon before taking the plunge in state politics in 1962, when she was elected to the Assembly from Jalgaon.

 Three years later, in July 1965, she married Devi Singh Shekhawat, an educationist.

 Patil remained an MLA till 1985. She became a deputy minister in 1967. Always known as a staunch Gandhi family loyalist, she was elevated to a cabinet ministers post in 1972.

 In 1979, when Sharad Pawar broke away from his mentor, chief minister Vasantdada Patil, the former lawyer became leader of Opposition for the Congress. She remained Opposition leader until February 1980.

 Her stint in Parliament began in 1985, when she was elected to the Rajya Sabha. A little over a year later, she became deputy chairperson of the House. Between 1986 and 1988, she also headed the House committee on privileges.

 In June 1988, Patil was appointed president of the Maharashtra State Congress Committee and held the job till December 1989. In 1991, she was elected to the 10th Lok Sabha from Amravati.

 In November 2004, the Congress leadership made her the first woman governor of Rajasthan.

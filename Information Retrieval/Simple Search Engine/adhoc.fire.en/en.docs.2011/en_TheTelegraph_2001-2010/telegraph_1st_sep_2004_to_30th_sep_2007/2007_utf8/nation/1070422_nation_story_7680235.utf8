 Awadhi card to fight jinx

 Lucknow, April 21: Shiv Balak Pasi couldnt believe his ears: Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was speaking in Awadhi.

 The 28-year-old backward caste member from Fursatganjs Rokha inched closer to the small podium on which the star Congress campaigner stood.

 He was in for another surprise: Priyanka was beckoning to him. The small crowd roared as he climbed onto the dais nervously.

 Pasi is the Congress candidate from Fursatganj in Amethi, but had hardly had an opportunity to talk to Priyanka.

 The young man is a first-time Assembly poll candidate, having earlier lost the local polls. Like many other Congress candidates, he had been kept off the dais by Priyankas security.

 Pasi is the Congress candidate from Fursatganj, Priyanka told the Rokha crowd in Hindi. Then she pointed at him and switched to Awadhi: Inka pahchanat haw, abki vote inhin ka deka hai (Do you know him, you have to vote for him this time).

 The crowd broke into chants of Priyanka Gandhi zindabad.

 In Amethi, as well as Rae Bareli, the Congress fields some of the most high-profile candidates in parliamentary elections to fashion landslide wins. But in the Assembly polls in these areas, its mostly small-time candidates have been cutting a sorry figure.

 Priyanka has accepted the challenge on the Gandhi home turf. I hope to break the jinx this time and that is why I am here, she told reporters.

 She has been strengthening the local party organisation, too, by successfully dousing factionalism. Last week, she persuaded rebel Congress candidates to withdraw.

 Priyanka, who arrived in Lucknow from Delhi this morning, will be camping in Amethi for the next three days.

 Union wades into Mittal slavery row

 CHRISTINE BUCKLEY

 London, June 11: Arcelor Mittals safety performance at its Kazakhstan coal mines is a stain on the UK, one of Britains leading trade unions said after revelations over the weekend that 90 miners had been killed in the companys operations in that country since 2004.

 Unite said the safety record and working conditions at the steel groups Kazakh operations were shameful because of the close links that Lakshmi Mittal, its chief executive, has with the UK. 

 Britains richest man, with a personal fortune of 19 billion, Mittal has his office and home in London and has given millions of pounds to the Labour Party.

 Arcelor Mittal defended its record amid criticism from Kazakh miners that they are treated like slaves and enjoyed better conditions in the Soviet era.

 A spokesman for Unite said: Slavery is wrong wherever it is found. You dont continue such exploitation, especially when it puts lives at risk. It is a stain on our society when a company with strong UK connections is linked to this in any way, shape or form.

 The miners in Kazakhstan, where Arcelor Mittal is the biggest employer with 50,000 workers, have complained that they have to use outdated equipment in the eight mines that Mittal has owned since 1996.

 Last September, 41 miners were killed in a gas explosion at the Lenina mine and two years earlier, 13 workers were killed in an explosion at the nearby Shakhtinskaya mine.

 The Lenina blast triggered a strike by the miners, which was settled when Mittal agreed to safety improvements and substantial pay rises.

 However, a spokesperson for Arcelor Mittal said $260 million had been invested in the mines from 1996 to last year and a further $63 million was planned for this year. The company has pledged to install more methane detectors.

 As the controversy emerged over the operation of the mines, Mittal suddenly withdrew from the Russian economic forum in St Petersburg, at which he had been due to speak. 

 The company was unable to say why he had pulled out of the key event at the last minute.

 David Sadler, Arcelor Mittals head of Africa and Asia mining, said: Investment in and development of health and safety are priority areas for Arcelor Mittal in the world and especially in Kazakhstan. We have been making significant investment and are seeing good progress in the modernisation of our mines and this is delivering real results.

 The company said there was no safety equipment when it bought the mines and that since then injuries have decreased by 70 per cent.

 The Kazakhstan mines have been awarded a $100 million grant from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to invest in new equipment.

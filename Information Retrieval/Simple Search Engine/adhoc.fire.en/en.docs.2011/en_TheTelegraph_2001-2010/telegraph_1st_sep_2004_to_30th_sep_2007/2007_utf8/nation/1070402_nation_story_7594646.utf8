 More dead lions in Gir

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, April 1: Two more lion carcasses were found in Gujarats Gir Sanctuary today, taking the number of such discoveries in the past one month to eight. However, forest officials denied a poaching link to the two dead animals, saying their skin, nails and claws were intact.

 The adult lion and a three-month-old cub were found in two places one in Tulsisham Range, in the east of Gir, and the other in the western part of the protected zone.

 Forest officials believe the lion could have died fighting another animal, while the cub possibly died of starvation.

 A red alert had been sounded after six lions were found dead all poaching cases.

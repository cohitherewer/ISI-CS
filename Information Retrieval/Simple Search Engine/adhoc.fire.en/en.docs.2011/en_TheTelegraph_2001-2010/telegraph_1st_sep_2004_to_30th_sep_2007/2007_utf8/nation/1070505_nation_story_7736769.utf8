The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Empty house at Munshi movies

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, May 4: Try Midnight Hot next time, honourable minister. Or Tara Rum Pum, or Honeymoon Travels Pvt Ltd.

 Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who found Midnight Hot on television too hot, is leaving his fellow MPs cold with the spread of films he has served up for them. 

 Haunted by trafficking scandals and weary of House disruptions, all that the MPs wanted was some entertainment.

 But the information and broadcasting minister had other ideas when he got a number of critically acclaimed films screened in Parliament this week. Das Munshi was pursuing the lofty goal of intellectual and aesthetic uplift. The poor MPs, however, only wanted a break.

 So, when images of Satyajit Rays Agantuk rolled in Parliaments Balayogi auditorium, the chairs were empty. Even MPs from Bengal who might not remember how many times they watched the classic gave it a miss.

 One lawmaker, who was in no mood to partake of Das Munshis meaningful cinema, didnt hide his feelings. 

 Who has the time for all this? I havent been able to take my wife out for the latest Bollywood blockbuster. They are showing all these staid films. I would have gone if it was something more exciting or informative, said Dharmendra Pradhan, a young BJP MP.

 The screenings started with Richard Attenboroughs Gandhi on April 30. Lined up on Das Munshis marquee are Kundan Shahs Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro on May 7, Rajan Khosas Swara Mandal on May 10, Goutam Ghoses Antarjali Yatra on May 11, K.S. Sethu Madhavans Marupakkam on May 14, Raj Kapoors Shree 420 on May 15 and Malayali director T.V. Chandrans Mangamma on May 17.

 But the empty house, show after show, isnt bothering the minister. What can I do? I had sent invitations to everyone. I can hardly help it if they are not interested in good cinema, Das Munshi told The Telegraph. 

 But the minister should thank one man who decided to rediscover Gandhi. I had not seen Gandhi, so I went, said Telugu Desam Party veteran K. Yarren Naidu.

 Naidu might thank Das Munshi for helping him catch up on a classic he could well have seen ages ago, but what he said next should worry the minister. I cant figure out what else they are screening. I havent heard the names of half of the films, said Naidu.

 Das Munshi might have had support from L.K. Advani, a self-confessed movie buff. But the BJP stalwart was too busy trying to fashion the script of the Uttar Pradesh election.

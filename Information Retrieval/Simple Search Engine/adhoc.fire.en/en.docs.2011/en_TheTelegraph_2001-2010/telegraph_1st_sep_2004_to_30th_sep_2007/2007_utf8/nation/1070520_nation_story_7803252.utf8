 Tables turned: heat on RSS

 POORNIMA JOSHI 

 Advani

 New Delhi, May 19: For the first time since the Sangh forced L.K. Advani to step down as BJP chief, the positions have been reversed.

 Not only is the RSS under fire for the BJPs poll debacle in Uttar Pradesh, Advanis oft-repeated caveat that it should restrict its influence to ideological matters is also increasingly finding resonance in the party circles.

 And its not just Sudheendra Kulkarni, Advanis former aide, who has publicly dismissed the Sanghs claim that the BJP fared poorly because Mayavati was better in advocating a soft Hindutva line. Even the partys office-bearers no longer hesitate in reacting sharply to the Sanghs critique.

 The election issue was not Ram temple. It was law and order and governance. Such analysis should not be taken seriously. At one level, it (the editorial of Sangh mouthpiece Organiser) says Hindutva was not successful, at another it attacks the BJP for not propagating aggressive Hindutva. It has no meaning, party general secretary Vinay Katiyar, a prominent heartland leader, told The Telegraph.

 Senior BJP leaders are now backing up with de- tails their claim that the Sangh has to share a major part of the blame for the BJPs defeat.

 BJP sources said six organising secretaries from the RSS were active in the state for the last one year.

 The Sangh, they added, deputed one organiser for every three districts. At the central level, two senior RSS leaders, Ram Lal and Nagendra Nath, oversaw operations in Uttar Pradesh, while activist Prabhat Jha had been sent for media management. 

 You can say that the Sangh was in charge of everything from election management to media affairs. They have to share some responsibility, said a senior leader.

 Besides election management, BJP sources said the Sangh interfered in ticket distribution as well. For instance, the sources cited party candidate Hanuman Mishras defeat in Govindnagar, Kanpur, a constituency with about 50 per cent Brahmin population, by a margin of over 40,000 votes.

 Sangh stalwart Nagendra Nath insisted that the ticket be given to Hanuman Mishra. We would have consoled ourselves if the BSPs Brahmin candidate won from there. But the seat went to Ajay Kapoor, a Punjabi Khatri fielded by the Congress, said a source.

 The sources said the BJP suffered in a number of constituencies like Kheragarh, Govardhan, Hastinapur, Swalkhas, Chobepur and Chattarwal because the RSS insisted on their favourites being fielded.

 RSS office-bearers dismiss such accusations.

 We had nothing to do with ticket distribution. What is there for us to introspect? How are we bothered about what happened in Uttar Pradesh? We are busy with our officers training camps these days, said a functionary.

 The wait for Rahul Godot Gandhi

 MANINI CHATTERJEE

New Delhi, Aug. 5: Political circles in Delhi are once again abuzz with talk of a cabinet shuffle and an AICC revamp but both, sources say, hinge on a decision to be taken by the MP from Amethi.

 So long have Congressmen been waiting for a decision that the more literary-minded have christened him Rahul Godot Gandhi. 

 But with less than two years left for the next general elections, Congress leaders across the board feel they can wait no longer and that it is time the crown prince takes up a more tangible role and responsibility in keeping with the demands of a multi-party democracy. 

 Although no one is willing to vouch for it, there is a growing hunch that Rahul may take the plunge finally by accepting a post either in the government or the party.

 Frankly, a senior Congress leader said, no one not the Prime Minister, not Pranabdada, not Ahmadbhai can say for sure what is going to happen. It will be a decision taken by mother and son. 

 Having said that, he added: But Rahul, too, realises that it is about time he takes up a post that can galvanise the party.

 The lack of firm knowledge of what is going on inside the minds of the residents of 10 Janpath has not stopped Congress leaders from debating the ideal course the Gandhi scion should follow in the days to come. 

 If some insist that he should become an AICC general secretary and end the sense of drift that has gripped the party, there are equally strong proponents of the view that he should join the government instead and acquire the requisite status and authority to push the UPAs agenda throughout the country.

 Congress insiders argue that Rahul is totally disinclined to a ministerial berth. 

 Why should he tie himself down to a government responsibility and be answerable for all kinds of decisions that a coalition government is forced to take, asked a young Congress MP, insisting that with a series of key Assembly elections in the run-up to the general elections in 2009, the party is the ideal place for him to be in.

 Echoing this view, a cabinet minister who remains a party animal underscored the importance of Rahul taking up an AICC post say, general secretary of mass fronts that would give him a chance to meet party workers and people across the country. We may not have fared well in the Uttar Pradesh polls, but everyone concedes that Rahuls campaign did touch a chord with the youth. The organisation let him down, but the people responded to the Gandhi charisma, the minister said.

 Besides, he started the campaign just a month ahead of the polls instead of working in Uttar Pradesh, as he had initially promised, from 2004 itself. 

 Thats a mistake the party does not want him to repeat. Lets face it, whether you like it or not, Rahul Gandhi is the future leader of the party. But for the partys future we have to win enough seats to matter in 2009 and we have to start preparations right away, an MP said. 

 But the preparations cannot begin as long as things stay stuck in limbo. That state is not going to change till a decision is taken on Rahul.

 The alternative view is that Rahul should join the council of ministers and be given a high-profile portfolio that will automatically give him a platform and profile befitting the man who may one day be king. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh offered him a ministerial berth on earlier occasions and is learnt to be quite keen to have Rahul in his team. 

 With more than half its term over, it is also the ideal time for the Congress to go in for a shuffle that would provide the interface between the government and the party as both get into election mode, many feel.

 A senior Congress leader, who belongs to the Rahul-for-cabinet school, pointed out that in the past, most important Congress leaders were also key ministers in the government. Being a minister does not mean that you break your links with the party. In fact, it reinforces the party-government relationship which has got eroded in recent years, he said.

 And if Rahul is so inclined, he could straightaway be made a cabinet minister, some argue. 

 After all, Rajiv Gandhi was just 40 when he became the Prime Minister and his mother was equally inexperienced when Lal Bahadur Shastri gave her a cabinet post in 1964.

 But one thing both camps agree on is that Rahul must decide soon. Politics, after all, is not a Samuel Beckett play like Waiting for Godot.

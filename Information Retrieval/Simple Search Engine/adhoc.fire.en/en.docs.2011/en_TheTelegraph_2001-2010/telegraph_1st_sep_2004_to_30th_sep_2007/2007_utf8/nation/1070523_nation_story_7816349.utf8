 Rites nail on parents

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, May 22: In the film Baghban, parents Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini return to their own home to live happily together after shabby treatment from their sons.

 In real life, the sons of Prakash Raju and Kamalamma had one more blow to strike.

 The two brothers yesterday held a combined shraddh for their parents even as the aged couple, who had just left them to live independently, begged them to stop.

 As in the film, Chandu and Madhu, married and working, had turned up at their parents home to ask for money and had been refused.

 The brothers shaved their heads, garlanded their parents photographs and held the rites at a function hall. When Raju and Kamalamma learnt of it, they rushed to the hall but the sons went on with the ceremony.

 They began serving the shraddh lunch to the invited Brahmins in front of their parents. When the guests realised what was happening, they rebuked the two, apologised to the parents and left.

 As news spread and people gathered to teach them a lesson, the sons fled.

 Raju, a 62-year-old retired railway employee, said he and Kamalamma had found it impossible to live either with Chandu or Madhu, so they had returned to their small house at Suraram Shivalaynagar in Hyderabad.

 They decided to move to their ancestral home in Krishna district, where they have a little land, and sold the city house for Rs 4 lakh. The sons then turned up to ask for a share of the money. 

 I told them the house was not ancestral property and I intended to keep the money for our future needs, Raju said.

 He said his elder son Chandu, a manager in a bar-cum-restaurant, lives waywardly. When we were living with him, if we questioned his lifestyle, he would abuse us.

 Neither could they adjust with corporate employee Madhu. We will now stay away from our sons forever.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Quota poison pours on Net

 - General category students heap abuse on lsquo;squirmy parasites rsquo;

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, May 13: When Ajay Chauhan heard of an online discussion on the governments controversial reservation policy, he immediately signed up. It was an opportunity, he felt, to air his views and clear a few misconceptions.

 Two days and a few heated debates later, Ajay was bluntly told to leave the yahoogroups discussion forum by some of the others, but not before the Other Backward Classes student from IIT Delhi had been labelled anti-national and a parasite for supporting reservation.

 Go ahead... have reservations. Why 50%? Have 100% reservation and ***** the nation. Dont worry about us, well manage. Were equipped for that without having to fall back like squirmy parasites on quotas and reservations!!! one message told him.

 Are OBCs or any caste which wants reservation physically or mentally handicapped? asked another. Are they unmanly? Or are they orphans? Or are they milk sucking kids who cant work hard and earn a respectful life?

 The All India Institute of Medical Sciences may be in the eye of a storm over accusations of caste bias, but the virtual world isnt lagging behind.

 Popular online chat sites like orkut.com, yahoogroups. com and slashindia.org are the latest theatres of vitriolic caste debates where reserved category students regularly face abuse.

 The discovery had shocked the three-member panel, headed by University Grants Commission chairman Sukhdeo Thorat, that probed caste discrimination at AIIMS and some other medical colleges.

 We realised it wasnt only about AIIMS. The online stuff we were shown was poisonous. And students from everywhere, including the IITs and IIMs, were participating. Its a fast spreading disease, a panel member said.

 Students from reserved categories at AIIMS said their anti-quota peers often advised them against joining these online discussions.

 The more sensitive among them would argue that the discussion may hurt our sentiments, a Scheduled Caste student told the Thorat committee.

 It certainly hurt Ajay, who cleared the IIT Joint Entrance Examination before the OBC reservation bill was passed.

 The scene may be the worst at AIIMS, but all of us from the SC, ST and OBC categories face it online. Why should I be barred from joining a discussion because I disagree with the others? he said.

 Kumar Harsh, AIIMS Resident Doctors Association president and founding member of anti-quota group Youth for Equality, said he didnt condone such comments. But these things, he felt, happen as a reaction to government policies.

 IIM Bangalore student Ramesh Choubey (name changed), who has participated in caste discussions on Orkut. com, agreed with Harsh that the strong comments reflect pent-up frustration.

 The feeling among the anti-quota people is, the government doesnt care about us. The Net seems a safe place to vent these opinions, though things do go overboard sometimes, he said.

 Not really, according to information technology law expert Pawan Duggal. The government has banned several websites that have content considered communal or are believed to be run by terror groups.

 The government, Duggal said, can either block such groups or punish those who posted the comments. 

 Section 377 of the IT Act deals with online content that spreads hatred.

 Internet law expert Mahesh Uppal, however, said giving a royal ignore to such incidents is the best way out.

 The moment you ban such groups, you run the risk of attracting attention to them, he said.

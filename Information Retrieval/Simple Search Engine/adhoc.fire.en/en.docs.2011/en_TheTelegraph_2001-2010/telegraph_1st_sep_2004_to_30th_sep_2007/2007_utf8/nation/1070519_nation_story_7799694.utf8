The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Catch match, a day after

 May 18: After the World Cup, Doordarshan doesnt seem to have had too much of faith in Sachin and Sourav. 

 If they had, few would have missed the fireworks of Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly in Chittagong today in the first Test against Bangladesh. At stumps, Sachin was unbeaten on 80 and Sourav on 82.

 But fans missed the action as cable operators did not tie up with Neo Sport, which holds the match telecast rights.

 The fans will now have to make do with recorded highlights on Doordarshan tomorrow morning. The highlights will be shown on an hour-long slot beginning 8 am.

 Doordarshan, which was showing the one-dayers, apparently decided not to telecast the Tests as the national broadcaster felt there would not be much interest.

 Under normal circumstances, there wouldnt have been. But after the World Cup debacle, a match against even Bangladesh has acquired an edge. Besides, the two veterans have fired together howsoever weak the opponents are at a time when a debate is raging about the age factor.

 Officially, Doordarshan, which fought tooth-and-nail for the right to telecast games of national interest, will not say why it felt the Test evoked little interest.

 But sources said showing the Test would have involved pulling several regular programmes off air for five days. Besides, 75 per cent of the advertisement revenue earned by Doordarshan through the series would have gone to Nimbus in any case.

 Direct to Home subscribers were also not spared as TataSky did not air the match. Neo Sports is not available on TataSky, a spokesperson said. Till now, TataSky has been re-transmitting Doordarshans cricket feed.

 Over 19 lakh cable homes in Calcutta missed the match. 

 When I heard Dada was playing well, I tried to tune in but discovered the match was not being telecast live. Even Doordarshan was not airing the match, said Somik Roy, a resident of Lake Town. 

 But not all were shedding tears. After Indias shameful exit from the World Cup, we have lost interest in cricket. Most probably, they are going to beat Bangladesh in both Tests but that does not generate much excitement among us, said 17-year-old Sayeed Ahmed.

 But cable consumers in many districts got to watch the Test. Local cable operators there, who are not part of the multi-system operators, were able to beam the match. 

 Some of the cable homes in Hooghly, Barasat, Howrah and some other districts were able to see the Test as those cable operators who are operating independently are able to telecast it, said an industry insider.

 DMK protests Lanka firing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, March 12: DMK workers today hit the streets to protest against the Sri Lankan Navys alleged indiscriminate attacks on Tamil fishermen, some of them on the Indian side of the international maritime boundary. 

 An ally of the UPA, the DMKs demonstration has caused a diplomatic embarrassment to the central alliance, which wants the interests of Tamils protected but has kept good relations with the Lankan leadership.

 Chief minister M. Karunanidhi justified the street march, saying there was no other way after a dozen fishermen from the state were either killed or injured in recent weeks by the Lankan navy. 

 M.K. Stalin, Karunanidhis son who is also a minister, and other key members of the cabinet met the Sri Lankan deputy high commissioner here and handed a memorandum calling for an immediate end to such attacks. 

 Karunanidhi had earlier written twice to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, urging him to raise the issue with Colombo. But the attacks continued. Last Saturday, a fisherman from Pamban near Rameshwaram fell to bullets fired by the Lankan navy. Four others were injured.

 Karunanidhi had been resisting pressure for direct action from both his allies and the Opposition. But Saturdays assault was the last straw. Our patience is running out when innocent Tamils who depend on fishing for livelihood are attacked daily, he said.

 Sri Lanka has denied the involvement of its navy in recent firing incidents on the Indian side of the maritime boundary. In a statement, its foreign ministry said whenever Indian fishermen stray into its waters, the navy escorts them back to the boundary, once their bona fides are established.

 Colombo says it is the banned LTTE which has been attacking Indian fishing trawlers with the sole aim of discrediting the Lankan navy.

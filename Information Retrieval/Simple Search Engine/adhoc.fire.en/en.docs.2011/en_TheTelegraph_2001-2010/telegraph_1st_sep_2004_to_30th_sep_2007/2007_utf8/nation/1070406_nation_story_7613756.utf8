 Caution call amid confusion

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN AND TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Mulayam

 Lucknow, April 5: Only this morning, Muslim leaders were admitting to confusion about whom to vote for in the Uttar Pradesh elections.

 Last-minute analyses were on about the track record of the main parties on Muslim issues but of the economic rather than religious sort as the first set of 60 constituencies prepared to go to the polls on Saturday.

 Sundays Shia-Sunni riots in Lucknow and Kanpur had raised fears of a plot to divide the Muslim vote, but the minds were sharp and clear as they traded arguments for and against the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, the BJP and the Congress.

 It was into this debate that news of the court judgment butted in. The stunned leaders learnt that a single-judge bench of Allahabad High Court had directed the state not to treat Muslims as a minority group because there are so many of them.

 Maulana Khalid Rasheed, the naib imam of Lucknow, said: A community whose population is small relative to that of the majority community is considered a minority. I dont want to comment on a court order but I wonder what happens to our rights and privileges now.

 But he stressed the community should respond to the order with great caution.

 Zafaryab Jilani, a lawyer and personal law board member, agreed. This is a legal matter and not a political one; nobody should exploit it politically. Well send this message out through every important Muslim forum.

 He emphasised that no Muslim body or individual should challenge the order (the state government later announced it would).

 Jilani, however, suggested that the judgment flew in the face of the Supreme Court order in the P.A. Inamdar case, delivered on August 12, 2005, which allowed governments to declare any group with less than half the countrys population as a minority.

 The verdict will intensify the scramble for Muslim votes, decisive in some 120 of the 403 constituencies and important in many more.

 The Samajwadi Party and the Congress have already promised to help upgrade madarsa education. Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav has vowed to increase the number of Muslim ministers from the 13 now if the voters elect more Muslims from his party.

 Community leaders say education and jobs are the key issues. Muslims have replaced the scheduled castes in the economic and social ladder, Shia leader Kalbe Jawad said.

 Those doing menial jobs in the tanneries are no longer Dalits but Muslims. The ratio is 60 per cent Muslims to 40 per cent Dalits. The BSP has empowered the Dalits but we have slipped down the ladder. That day isnt far away when only Muslims will be sweeping the streets and cleaning toilets.

 The naib imams chief concern is the destruction of small and cottage industries 70 per cent of whose owners and employees are Muslims by the influx of Chinese goods, SEZs and foreign investment in retail.

 Syed Shah Fazle Rehman, the imam of Tille Walli mosque, said the court order may work in the Samajwadi Partys favour. He cited the two new Muslim universities in Rampur and Lucknow, the grants to 250 madarsas and the loan waivers to farmers and weavers as examples of Mulayams largesse.

 In the 2002 Assembly polls, a divided vote bank had kept the number of Muslim MLAs down to 44 in a House of 403, with the Samajwadi Party accounting for 30. The high court judgment can only increase the chances of en bloc voting.

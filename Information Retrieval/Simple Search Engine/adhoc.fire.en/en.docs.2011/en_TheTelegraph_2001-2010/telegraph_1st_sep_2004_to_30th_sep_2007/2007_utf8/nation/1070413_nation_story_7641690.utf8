 Agni passes test in missile milestone

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Long-range gains

 New Delhi, April 12: India today test-fired its nuclear- capable and longest-range missile, the Agni III, and defence scientists overseeing the project immediately claimed that the country had achieved a major milestone in missile technology.

 The first test of the missile on July 9 last year was unsuccessful. With this (todays) success, the design team is happy that the problems faced in the previous attempt on July 9 last year have been fully understood and solved, a defence ministry statement said.

 Defence minister A.K. Antony said: India has matured in the missile technology area and was definitely on a par with many other developed countries.

 The 16-metre-long missile lifted off from a rail-mobile launcher leaving a trail of orange and yellow smoke over Wheelers Island on the Orissa coast at 10.52 this morning, the statement said. It flew on a trajectory simulating its range of 3,000 km and splashed down near Car Nicobar in the Bay of Bengal 15 minutes later.

 The missile weighed 48 tonnes and was capable of carrying a payload of 1.5 tonnes. The Agni III, designed to hit targets as distant as 3,000 km-plus, brings all of Pakistans and many of Chinas cities, including Beijing, within its range. 

 This is not a first in Asia China in January tested a missile that knocked out a dead satellite in space but is a definite sign that the race for missiles that can travel longer with nuclear payloads has just intensified further. 

 The Agni III is still far from induction into the military. More tests of the missile will inevitably follow. The defence ministry statement said the missile has no communication ground systems and is autonomous and fully intelligent to reach its designated target.

 2 killed in UP over poll debate

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, May 20: Two Samajwadi Party workers were killed today in the first clash in Uttar Pradesh after elections in the state.

 Sources said the clash broke out between Bahujan Samaj Party supporters and Samajwadi Party workers during a discussion on the poll results at a village under the Isauli block of Sultanpur district, about 150 km from here.

 The Samajwadi Partys candidate had won from Isauli.

 Around 10.30 am, the discussion allegedly took a violent turn when some villagers used filthy language against a local leader, against which his supporters protested.

 A discussion on the poll results, during which abusive language was used against a leader, snowballed into a clash in Simrauna Sitla ki Purwa village. Three persons opened fire, killing two persons, senior superintendent of police Ajay Mishra said.

 A search is on to arrest the three persons, he added.

 The SSP said it was not a purely political clash. The trio had an old feud with the two victims.

 The accused persons might have taken advantage of the poll dispute to kill their enemies, he added.

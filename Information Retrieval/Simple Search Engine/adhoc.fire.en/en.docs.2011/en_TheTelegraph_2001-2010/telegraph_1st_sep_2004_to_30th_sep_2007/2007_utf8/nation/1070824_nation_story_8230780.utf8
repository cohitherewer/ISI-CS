 Mock war on despite protest

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: The five-nation naval exercise in the Bay of Bengal next month will simulate an environment of regular and irregular armed conflict and will culminate in a mock war with contingents from the US, India, Australia, Japan and Singapore divided into rival red and blue forces, navy chief Admiral Sureesh Mehta said here today. 

 Protests by the Left against the civilian nuclear deal and the allegation that the Indian military was being drawn into an American system of alliances have had little impact on the schedule of the drills. 

 It is wrong to interlink the civilian nuclear deal with the exercise, said the admiral. Asked if the navy was told to reschedule the exercise because of the Lefts protests, Mehta said: I am unaware of any such thing. The armed forces are apolitical. As far as I know, the exercise is on.

 Most state-controlled militaries factor in the politics of a place before organising international meets of the kind the Malabar-07-02 promises to be. In October-November 2005, over 60,000 Left cadres protested outside the Kalaikunda airbase in Bengal where the India-US joint fighter exercise was based. 

 Even as the Left raised the pitch of its campaign against that exercise (Cope India 05), the military establishment in Delhi was certain that war games would not be disrupted. The participating personnel from the US were advised to travel in groups when they ventured outside the airbase. This time, the exercise would be even less visible as much of it would be in mid-sea. 

 As the war game progresses, two rallies from Chennai and Calcutta mobilised by the Left will converge at Visakhapatnam in a show of protest against Indias pro-US policies, the CPM has announced. CPM general secretary Prakash Karat has written that the series of war games with the US and the strategic relationship was interlocking the Indian military into the Pentagons system of alliances. 

 The planning for the exercise (Malabar-07-02) began at least a year back, said Mehta. We have had three preparatory conferences. The initial one was about six to seven months back when there was no nuclear deal. I am not sure that the two things (the naval exercise and the nuclear deal) are interlinked at all.

 The 123 Agreement was initialled by India and the US on July 27. 

 The Indian Navy has participated in international war games with a number of countries. With the US, its interactions have steadily increased. 

 This would be the 13th Malabar since 1995, Mehta said. And over the years, we have graduated up the complexity scale.

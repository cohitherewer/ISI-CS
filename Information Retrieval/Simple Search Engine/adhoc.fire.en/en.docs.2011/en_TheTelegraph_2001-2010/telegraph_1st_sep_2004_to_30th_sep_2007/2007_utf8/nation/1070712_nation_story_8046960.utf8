 CBI to Aussies: wheres request?

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 11: An Australian police team was told by the CBI to come with a formal request if it wanted help with the probe into the Indian link to the UK terror plots.

 The officials, working on leads gleaned from the questioning of Mohammed Haneef, the doctor detained in Brisbane, had approached the Indian chapter of Interpol, which is run here by the CBI.

 A request for cooperation would have to be made through a letter rogatory to the Indian government, they were told. The message was blunt: one cannot just walk into the office of an Indian investigating agency with casual inquiries. The request needed to be routed either through the ministry of home affairs or the foreign office.

 The Australian investigators are in Delhi to probe the involvement of Haneef and will visit Bangalore, his hometown. The CBI said they were free to travel inside the country. 

 Bangalore police and not the CBI are handling the probe into the Indian link to the failed bombings in Britain.

 Sources said India is open to international cooperation on terrorism, but cant allow foreign agencies a free run.

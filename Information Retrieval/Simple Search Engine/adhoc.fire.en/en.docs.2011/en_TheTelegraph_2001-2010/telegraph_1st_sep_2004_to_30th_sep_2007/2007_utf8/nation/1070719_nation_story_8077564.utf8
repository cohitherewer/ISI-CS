 Terrorist

 - Court questions blot on character

 July 18: Barefoot and hunched over, face buried in his knees, Mohammed Haneef was transported today in an armoured police van to a Brisbane jail where the Indian doctor will be held as a terrorist.

 You have to appreciate he is being treated as a terrorist, said police minister Judy Spence today, defending the heavy security around Haneef who will now spend 23 hours a day in solitary confinement. 

 But the doctor received support in court, where the federal judge hearing his appeal against cancellation of his visa questioned the Australian governments judgement. 

 Unfortunately, I wouldnt pass the character test on your statement because Ive been associated with people suspected of criminal conduct, Justice Spender told the immigration department counsel in a brief hearing.

 The judge, who posted the hearing for August 8, questioned the basis for the governments reasonable suspicion that Haneef had an association with terrorists. 

 The doctor has been charged with recklessly providing support to a terrorist organisation because he gave his mobile phone SIM card with unused credit to second cousin Sabeel Ahmed a year ago. Sabeel and his brother Kafeel are suspects in the failed UK bombings.

 Hours after he was granted bail on Monday by a magistrate who said the police had not shown a direct link between Haneef and the UK terror plot, the government cancelled the doctors visa on the ground that he had failed the character test. 

 The order, which blocked his release on bail since it meant Haneef would be detained under immigration laws, has caused alarm because it is seen as interference with the rule of law.

 As protesters gathered in Sydney demanding the doctors immediate release, Australian Prime Minister John Howard slammed the leak of the transcript of one of two interviews Haneef gave to the police after his July 2 arrest. The transcript quotes the doctor as saying he had tried calling a British police officer on July 2 after Sabeel was arrested, but the calls went unanswered. 

 Haneef said he received a phone call from Sabeels mother, who told him a British officer wanted to speak with him and gave him the officers phone number. She said to me that there was something wrong with your mobile phone, someone was misusing the thing, he said, adding that he tried to call to clear his name. The police interviewer said he had checked and it appeared Haneef had called the British officers number four times on July 2.

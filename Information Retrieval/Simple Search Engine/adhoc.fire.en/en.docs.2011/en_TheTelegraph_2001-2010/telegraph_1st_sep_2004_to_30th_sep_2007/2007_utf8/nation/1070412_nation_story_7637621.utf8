New Delhi/Srinagar, April 11: Two pilots of an Indian Air Force helicopter were killed after their Cheetah crashed in the Siachen glacier this morning, the first major casualties in the region since the ceasefire with Pakistan three years ago.

 The bodies of Squadron Leader S. Basu and Flight Lieutenant A. Sharma were found near the Amar helipad, at 18,000 feet, in the evening.

 Preliminary reports suggest the pilots were attempting to land in poor visibility. It is possible the skis of the helicopter missed the touchdown spot and the chopper fell into an abyss.

 Basu and Sharma were part of a two-helicopter detachment of the Siachen Pioneers based in the armys Siachen base camp. The squadron itself is based in Leh but its two-helicopter detachment is rotated every week.

 Basu and Sharma took off in their aged Cheetah helicopter at 6.28 am on a routine sortie to drop supplies in the northern glacier. It was not immediately clear if the helicopter was expected to land, but after 7 am, radio contact was lost.

 There was heavy snowfall and poor visibility in the area, said defence spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel V.K. Mathur in Srinagar. 

 The Siachen Pioneers is the IAFs 114 helicopter unit stationed in Leh. It is the oldest battle unit in Siachen. The Pioneers fly in the most difficult conditions, testing the aircraft beyond limits specified by the manufacturer.

 The unit is at the core of Operation Meghdoot the military name for the Siachen-holding operation that began in 1984 and its Cheetahs are overdue for replacement.

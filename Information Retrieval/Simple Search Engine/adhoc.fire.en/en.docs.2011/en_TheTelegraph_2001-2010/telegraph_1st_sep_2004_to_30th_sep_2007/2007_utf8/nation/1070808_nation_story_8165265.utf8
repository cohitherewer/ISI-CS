 Star knocks on SC door

 - Sanjay lawyers challenge conviction, seek bail

 New Delhi, Aug. 7: Sanjay Dutts lawyers have challenged his conviction under the Arms Act in the Supreme Court and have sought bail for the actor lodged in a Pune jail. 

 Sanjay, say legal experts, may have to spend anything between two days and two weeks more behind bars for technical reasons, but is eventually likely to be granted bail, going by precedent. 

 Last week, an anti-terror court had sentenced Sanjay to six years rigorous imprisonment for possessing an AK-56 rifle and a 9mm pistol without an arms licence. 

 In their appeal filed before the Supreme Court, Sanjays lawyers have argued that his conviction was based on a confession the actor made to police soon after his arrest in 1993, but retracted later. 

 Under Indian law, confessions to the police are not considered evidence because they could have been extracted from the accused under duress. 

 A confession is considered valid if made by the accused before a magistrate. 

 The repealed Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act and the Prevention of Terrorism Act, however, allowed a court to consider a confession before the police as evidence. 

 Sanjay, though convicted only under the Arms Act, had been charged under the anti-terror law in the 1993 Bombay blasts case but was cleared. 

 Through the 14 years the Mumbai anti-terror court heard the case, the prosecution argued for Sanjays conviction under the anti-terror law. 

 Sanjays lawyers will argue that his conviction based, they claim, on his confession was wrong because he was found innocent under the anti-terror law. 

 Normally, it takes around two weeks before an appeal filed by an accused comes up for hearing, Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan said. 

 Cases are heard in the order in which appeals or petitions are filed. 

 Lawyers can, however, make an oral mention to the Chief Justice of India seeking an early hearing, Bhushan said. 

 Sanjays legal team which includes luminaries such as Fali Nariman and Harish Salve will have to convince the Chief Justice of the necessity for an early hearing, Bhushan said. 

 Big budget films riding on the actor could be one argument that Sanjays counsel may cite, lawyers said. 

 If this argument is accepted, the case could come up for hearing by Friday. 

 Sanjay, his lawyers will argue, should be granted bail because his conduct over the past 12 years as an undertrial has been ideal.

 Since Sanjay has stayed away from scraps with the law since his release in 1995, his demand for bail is likely to be granted, lawyers say. 

 If the lawyers feel the case is slipping away from them, they will argue for Sanjay to be let off on probation because of his exemplary behaviour during an earlier 16-month stint in jail. 

 A person on probation can continue living as a free man but must not break even the most puny law during the period he was to be imprisoned for.

 Mallya to hunt for F1 Indian

 London, Sept. 11 (Reuters): Vijay Mallya said today he wanted to bring an Indian driver back into Formula One once he took over the struggling Spyker team.

 An Indian team with an Indian driver would be the ideal combination, he told the official Formula One web site (www.formula1.com). In the future, I will look very carefully into our karting championship to identify talents that can be developed into potential candidates for the team.

 Mallya has teamed up with Spykers director of Formula One, Michiel Mol, to make an 80-million euro offer for the Dutch-owned team. The deal is due to be completed by the end of the month once due diligence has been carried out.

 Narain Karthikeyan drove for Jordan, the British-based team bought by Midland and then sold on to Spyker last year, as the first Indian Formula One driver in 2005. Karun Chandhok is currently competing in the GP2 feeder series.

 However, Mallya said it was too early to say whether either would be chosen.

 Spykers current line-up is German rookie Adrian Sutil and Japans Sakon Yamamoto.

 Mallya, the chairman of UB Group, said: There are people waiting in line now with their cheque book in their hand trying to partner with us. And when we announced the Indian flag would be part of the team colours and logo, there was an explosion of excitement romping through the country.

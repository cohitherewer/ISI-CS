 Reliance open to Bengal retail terms

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 10: Reliance officials met agriculture marketing minister Mortaza Hossain at Writers Buildings today to request him to issue the licence the company needs to trade in farm products.

 Kalyan Sarangi, the Reliance state coordinator, and other officials explained the project proposal and told the minister the company was open to everything, including a joint venture with the government. 

 The company, which is seeking the right to buy farm produce directly from the farmers, told Hossain the government was welcome to fix a minimum support price.

 The minister said he would get back to them. I told him to submit a fresh proposal on the retail project since we cannot accept its earlier proposal that wanted to involve the state government. 

 Neither is the government going to sign any MoU with the Reliance retail venture nor are we going to provide them land for their shops, Hossain said.

 Left Front sources said Reliance officials also visited the Forward Bloc office to lobby for their project. The Bloc, which has a stranglehold on the farm products marketing apparatus in the state, has been opposing Reliances entry.

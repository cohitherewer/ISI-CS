 New Delhi, Feb. 26: India may get its first opportunity for field research in the Arctic during the International Polar Year (IPY) 2007-08, the biggest science campaign in the fragile polar regions in 50 years that opens on Thursday.

 Indian scientists will be engaged in three projects relating to the oceans and the atmosphere as part of the IPY, a mammoth enterprise that will unite over 50,000 scientists from 60 countries involved in over 200 projects.

 The IPY is aimed at understanding better how the Arctic and Antarctic regions will shape the future of the planet through their role in climate change. 

 Through the work over the next year, we hope to gain fresh perspectives on how both polar regions will affect different parts of the world, Reinhard Deitrich, president of the German Commission for the IPY told The Telegraph.

 Scientists have predicted global warming may melt ice in the polar regions and lead to a rise in sea level, but there is still great uncertainty over the actual increase in the sea level. 

 To predict better whether the sea level rises by 18 cm or by 60 cm, we have to go the polar regions and observe the behaviour of the ice and glaciers there, Deitrich said.

 In preparation for the IPY, Indias Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences (DEOS) has asked scientists to submit proposals for short-term research projects in the Arctic, DEOS secretary Prem Shankar Goel told The Telegraph.

 India is negotiating with Norway to allow an Indian research contingent to collaborate on Arctic research. Were looking at various scientific themes that Indian scientists could pursue in the Arctic, Goel said.

 However, the three Indian projects already approved by the IPY will involve observations of the oceans depths from the tropical waters near India all the way to Antarctica as well as studies of the atmosphere.

 Indian scientists will sail aboard research cruise ships across the southern Indian ocean, examining water temperature, salt levels, as well as weather parameters as they approach the polar region.

 Such studies will help us understand better the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere, which is a very important factor driving the weather and the climate, Rasik Ravindran, director of the National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research and secretary of the National IPY committee, told The Telegraph.

 The IPY 2007-08 will begin on Thursday with a formal ceremony in Berlin where many participating scientists will outline their projects. 

 The last gigantic exercise in which scientists around the world explored the polar regions occurred during the International Geophysical Year 1957. 

 All research data that emerges from the IPY 2007-08 will be integrated and made public.

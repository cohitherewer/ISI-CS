The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Spontaneous to secretive

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Aishwarya and Abhishek: In hiding

 January 14, 2007: Amitabh Bachchan in a silk kurta pyjama stands outside his bungalow, Jalsa, in Juhu. After announcing the Abhishek-Aishwarya engagement, he requests the media to pray for the couple.

 April 17, 2007: A day before the wedding celebrations begin, Amitabh in a red sherwani is almost hiding from the media. Hundreds of security people at his bungalows, Jalsa and Prateeksha, and Aishwaryas building, La Mer in Bandra, have made it clear it is a private affair and they do not want to have anything to do with the media.

 This total turnaround and a security set-up that would have made George Bush proud must have been planned months in advance. Wooden soundproof enclosures, layers of police cordon and private security, encrypted wedding cards, the Bachchans have left nothing to chance.

 Its difficult to believe the timing of the engagement was as spontaneous as claimed. After more than a year of seeing each other, why was the date picked just two days after the Abhishek-Aishwarya-starrer Guru hit the theatres on January 12? 

 A trade analyst says: The engagement announcement strengthened the box-office collections after the expected big first weekend. The news didnt allow the film to drop. There is no AbAsh release now. 

 The media has been allowed to stand on the road divider in front of Jalsa and on the road-bend (Guru Nanak Road) opposite Prateeksha. Media platforms have been set up by the Bachchans themselves. But the zoom lens are of little use as the Mercs and Landcruisers of the Sanjay Dutts and Karan Johars zip in and out with tinted glasses rolled up.

 Many see it as history repeating itself. Thirty-four years ago, on June 3, when Amitabh and Jaya had got married, it was all hush-hush. But that was an extremely low-key affair with both actors rushing from the sets and quickly taking the saat phere. 

 The AbAsh wedding is anything but low-key. Spanning three days, the celebrations will have a large part of the industry in attendance. 

 There is also talk of the Bachchans selling the pictures and publishing rights of the wedding to a British tabloid for a hefty sum. So, the only people left high and dry are Indian reporters and photographers.

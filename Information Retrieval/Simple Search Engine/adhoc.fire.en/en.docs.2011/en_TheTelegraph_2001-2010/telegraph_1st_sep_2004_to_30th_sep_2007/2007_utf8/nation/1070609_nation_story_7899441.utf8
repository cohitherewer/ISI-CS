 Suicide bid to wash off woes

Meet Sudhakar Upadhyay, a stressed-out Mumbaikar who doesnt really know what to do with a life in which the most important thing is his faulty washing machine.

 The 36-year-old jumped off the third floor of a Vashi mall after he failed to find a key component that would have got his machine up and running. Clearly overwhelmed with the laundry list of his lifes problems, the dentist from Koparkhairane, a colony not far from Vashi, thought it was the end of the world.

 Moments before he took the near-fatal plunge last week, he was seen loitering around the place munching away at a franky.

 My son was depressed as our washing machine wasnt working. The service centre had insisted on a special pipe, which he couldnt find anywhere. He must have felt frustrated and taken this drastic step. Being a compulsive drinker, he may have also been under the influence of alcohol, Sudhakars mother said. He is now in hospital with multiple head injuries and broken limbs. 

 Cold feet on disclosures

They arent really coy about showing off their wealth, but filing their income details doesnt come easily to Andhra Pradeshs MLAs. 

 Only three of the 294 legislators have filed income-tax returns in time this financial year. All are from the Telugu Desam Party, whose boss N. Chandrababu Naidu has led by example.

 The rest, including chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy and his cabinet colleagues, and the council of ministers have been fighting shy.

 K. Tuljanand Singh, the Assemblys secretary, said notices were sent last year to over 200 legislators to submit income statements. But only 41 complied with the order in 2006. The figure was 40 the year before.

 This year, the MLAs were to complete the filings between March 15 and April 15. We will send notices after June 15, said Singh, but added the submissions were voluntary. 

 Stretched too far

From Surya Namaskar to Padmasana to subtleties of the art of levitation, yoga skills were on display not at a camp in a Chennai stadium, but on the streets outside it. 

 So, have yoga practitioners hit the streets? Yes. And, they are more than practitioners. They are teachers demanding jobs in government schools where yoga is now a subject.

 To make themselves seen and heard, the band of over 100 men and women gathered outside Chepauk Stadium last week to observe a day-long hunger-strike. But they made sure the passers-by were convinced they deserved the job. 

 The demonstration came after their requests for employment fell on deaf ears. There is another reason, too. Most protesters want the jobs before age starts telling on their nimble feet and hands. But yogas age-defying effects not a secret, the excuse seems like stretching it a bit too far.

 Landing room

New terminals and wider runways arent the only new plans in the Delhi airport upgrade. Last week, it emerged that there will be a variety of hotels just outside.

 Delhi International Airport, a subsidiary of GMR Infrastructure, which is carrying out the revamp, has asked real estate developers keen on building the hotels to table bids.

 The company can develop 5 per cent of the land around the airport on commercial lines, but the result should be increased facilities for passengers. Preparing for tourist arrivals for the Commonwealth Games three years from now, about 39 acres have been set aside for hotels and other commercial ventures.

 Bangalore: Dont miss A Kings Journey, a shadow puppet play directed by Peter Muller of Theater Handgemenge from Germany on June 9 at Ranga Shankara. Show begins at 7.30 pm. 

 Tickets (Rs 100) at Max Mueller Bhavan, Lavelle Road, and at the venue.

 CBI scare for Mulayam

 OUR BUREAU

 Mulayam

 New Delhi/Lucknow, March 1: Mulayam Singh Yadav received a second shock from the Supreme Court ahead of the Assembly polls today when the CBI was asked to carry out a preliminary probe into his wealth.

 The court order came on a public interest litigation filed in December 2005 by a citizen, alleged to be a Lucknow Congress worker. Vishwanath Chaturvedis petition accuses the chief minister and his family of possessing Rs 100 crore worth of assets that cannot be explained by their known sources of income.

 The allegation is made against the chief minister of a big state which has cast a cloud on his integrity. Hence, it is in his interest and also to uphold public morality in high offices that an independent agency should look into it, the court said. The chief minister should have his honour vindicated.

 The CBI will also probe Mulayams sons Akhilesh a member of Parliament and Prateek, and Akhileshs wife Dimple. After it submits a report, the Centre will decide what steps can be taken.

 Fearing that the central agency could make life difficult for Mulayam before a crucial election, his party said he would file a review petition to try and get the probe assigned to a different agency or a sitting judge.

 The CBI is subject to pressure from the Congress and cannot be termed an independent agency, Samajwadi Party leader and Mulayams brother Ramgopal Yadav said in Lucknow.

 We do not trust the CBI. Its track record in the Quattrocchi matter and some other cases is not clean, he added.

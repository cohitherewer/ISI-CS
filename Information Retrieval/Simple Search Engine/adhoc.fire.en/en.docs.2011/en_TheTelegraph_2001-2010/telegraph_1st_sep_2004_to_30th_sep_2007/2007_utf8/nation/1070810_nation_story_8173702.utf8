 Rs 25 for star, Rs 20 for free millions 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug 9: If Yerwada could accommodate them, 29 crore Indians might have traded freedom for a more comfortable life.

 Actor Sanjay Dutt, serving his six-year rigorous imprisonment in the jail, will earn around Rs 25 a day for the labour he puts in. 

 The Indians who would have envied his luck now make less than Rs 20. Out of this, they also have to pay for their food and accommodation unlike prisoners. The figure has come out in a report on the plight of unorganised sector workers.

 These people, mostly daily wage earners, are from the most vulnerable and marginal sections. About 88 per cent of the SCs and STs fall in such a category. The number is 80 per cent for OBCs and 84 per cent for Muslims. 

 The National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector, which crafted the report, wants social security for the workers who make up 86 per cent of the workforce saying the alternative is starvation.

 The panel, headed by economist Arjun Sengupta, has recommended a Rs 45,000-crore package for 39.5 crore such workers, 79 per cent of whom are worse off than a Sanjay toiling away in jail. The actor does not even pay for food and shelter.

 The package sets aside Rs 19,400 crore for social security of farm hands and Rs 12,900 crore for fringe workers. 

 The aim of the package is to create a minimum level of social security, a floor, below which nobody should fall.

 The need for such an intervention has arisen partly because the decline in the numbers of those living below the poverty line in past few years has gone hand in hand with a slump in the quality of jobs, said Sengupta.

 Between 1999 and 2004, total jobs increased from 397 million to 457 million, of which 8.5 million new opportunities were created in the formal sector. But the gains almost wiped out when it emerged that 8.6 million jobs in the formal sector turned into informal or contract ones.

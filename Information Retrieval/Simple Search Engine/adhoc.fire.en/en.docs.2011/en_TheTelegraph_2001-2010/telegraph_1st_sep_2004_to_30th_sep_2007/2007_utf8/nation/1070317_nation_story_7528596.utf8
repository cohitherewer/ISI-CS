 Delhi shies off team to Nandigram 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 16: The United Progressive Alliance today bowed to Left pressure, ending any chance of a parliamentary or all-party delegation being sent to Nandigram.

 With no agreement on the subject between the Opposition and the ruling alliance, plans for a similar mission to Chhattisgarh have also been dropped.

 As a face-saver, the Congress will be sending its own teams to Nandigram and Bijapur, the first led by Digvijay Singh and the second by Mukul Wasnik.

 This, Congress sources said, was the least the party could do to avoid being seen as completely sacrificing its principles to coalition politics.

 As the Congress agonised over its Bengal dilemma, the politics of delegations played itself out in the corridors of Parliament all morning.

 First, the National Democratic Alliance repeated its demand for a parliamentary team to Nandigram and warned that unless this was conceded, it would not allow Parliament to function.

 The BJPs deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, said that when she called Priya Ranjan Das Munshi this morning, the parliamentary affairs minister cited three reasons why a team need not be sent.

 One, law and order problems did not merit sending one; two, the Calcutta High Court order for a CBI probe made such a delegation superfluous; three, a team could not be formed without a consensus among parties.

 Sushma gave the media her counter-arguments. One, Nandigram was extraordinary as farmers were massacred and the court had taken suo motu cognisance of it. Two, the other three pillars of democracy the executive (the Bengal governor), judiciary and the media had responded fully; so it was incumbent on Parliament to do its bit.

 She argued that since the NDA was united on the subject, the government was duty-bound to evolve a consensus among its allies.

 At a meeting called by Rajya Sabha chairperson B.S. Shekhawat, junior parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Pachauri offered another argument against a parliamentary team.

 He told Sushma and Jaswant Singh, leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, that only the presiding officers of the two Houses could, jointly, seek such a delegation; the government could not.

 Jaswant said that if the Lok Sabha Speaker had any apprehensions, the government could set up an all-party team instead. But there was no word from the government, Sushma told reporters.

 After this, the NDA decided to send its own team, led by L.K. Advani. 

 The government accused the BJP of going back on a promise it had made yesterday. Das Munshi said that at a meeting in the deputy Speakers chamber, the BJP had promised to cooperate in the passage of the appropriation bill and allow the finance minister to make his speech.

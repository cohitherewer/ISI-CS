 Waiter serves an example

 SANTOSH SINGH 

 Patna, May 18: A restaurant employee earning Rs 2,500 a month returned Rs 1.97 lakh left behind by a customer.

 Last Saturday, Izaz Ahmed walked into a restaurant on Frazer Road and ordered a special Marwari thali for lunch. 

 After his meal, he paid the bill and left, without picking up the bag in which he had kept the money.

 The contractor would have rued the lunch for life, but for Sarwan Mishras honesty. Sarwan found four bundles of notes (Rs 500 denomination), an SBI Kishanganj chequebook and a bank guarantee paper.

 Sarwan took the bag to restaurant manager Satish, who called up the owner. They decided to wait for the customer to return. 

 Satish said: We waited for two hours for the customer to come and take his bag back. When he did not, we called up police. 

 The chequebook helped identify the customer. The police later learnt that Izaz had come to Patna to bid for a Food Corporation of India tender.

 The bank guarantee of Rs 5 lakh and the cash suggest so, said an officer of the Kotwali police station.

 Izaz, who had put up at a hotel near the railway station, did come back to the restaurant in the evening, but the bag had been handed over to the police by then. The cash and papers were returned to him on May 13. 

 Izaz left for Kishanganj soon after but did not remember to thank Sarwan or the restaurant manager. 

 Sarwan, in his mid-thirties, has not brought his family from Darbhanga because his wages arent enough to make ends meet in a city like Patna.

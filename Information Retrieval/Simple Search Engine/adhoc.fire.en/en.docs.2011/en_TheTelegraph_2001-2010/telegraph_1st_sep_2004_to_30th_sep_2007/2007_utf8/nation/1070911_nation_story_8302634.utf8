 Hyderabad suspects papers in order

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Sept. 10: Police have found nothing incriminating against Hyderabad blast suspect Shahi Rafzani during checks carried out today with her in Vellore.

 A five-member Andhra police team, which included a lady constable, drove with the Bangladeshi girl into the Tamil Nadu town from Chittoor this morning.

 The officers first visited Auxilium College in Katpadi, near Vellore, to confirm whether Shahi was a student of the institution. This was followed by a search of the house where Shahi stayed on rent in Vellore town. 

 Shahi is a third-year BA (English literature) student and her papers are in order, a senior Tamil Nadu officer who coordinated the search operations with Andhra police said after the checks were over this evening.

 Shahi had been arrested in Hyderabad for not possessing proper travel documents, including visa and passport. She had told investigators that she had left behind the papers in Vellore, the sources said. 

 The claim turned out to be true as the papers were found in the house, located in the towns Gandhi Nagar area. The passport that the 27-year-old had was a regular one, the officer said, adding her student visa was valid up to June 4, 2008.

 Shahi had also registered at the Vellore superintendent of polices office a requirement that foreign nationals staying in India have to fulfil since 2005, the year in which she took admission in the college.

 However, her passport and foreigners registration certificate have been seized, as have other items found during the search of the house. These included a cellphone and a family album, the officer said. The Andhra team left with Shahi for Hyderabad this evening.

 Police, who have earlier been wrong about Shahi, are treading cautiously. They first said she was a second-year student of Christian Medical College, only to later admit she was in her BA final year in the Katpadi college.

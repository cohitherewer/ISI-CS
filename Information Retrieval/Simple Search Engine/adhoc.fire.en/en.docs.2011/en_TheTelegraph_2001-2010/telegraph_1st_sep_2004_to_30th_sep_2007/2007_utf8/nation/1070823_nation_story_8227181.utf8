 Priya claws out for Ronen

 OUR BUREAU

 Sen

 New Delhi, Aug. 22: Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today said there is no question of exonerating anybody, fuelling speculation whether some sort of action is being planned against ambassador Ronen Sen over his headless chicken remark.

 The government, too, indicated that it would not go out of its way to protect the ambassador to the US.

 In the course of an impromptu discussion on the ambassadors remarks, the Speaker said: Give me some time. I had myself said at the beginning yesterday that I will take strong action. But there is a process, we have to act in a manner that is consistent with natural justice.

 From the governments side, parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said he would convey the feelings of the House to the foreign minister and the Prime Minister. No bureaucrat or diplomat has any right to cast aspersions on Parliament or the media and we will do everything to protect their dignity, he added.

 Das Munshis comments surprised many as Sen, a seasoned diplomat with friends across the political divide, had readily issued an unqualified apology after what he described as off-the-cuff remarks were made public.

 Das Munshi said dissent on any issue, including the nuclear deal, is a matter of the House and political parties, and no diplomat can comment on that.

 No officer can speak like this even in an off-the-record conversation. He can express his personal views to his family members in his house but not sitting in his office and talking to the media. We shall not compromise an inch and the whole House should stand united in defending the honour of Parliament, he said.

 But Das Munshi lamented that the Opposition had not expressed similar anguish when a senior leader (George Fernandes) spoke of the Prime Minister being shot in the head. 

 In the Lok Sabha, Lalu Prasads RJD demanded the ambassadors recall, but outside the House, party leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said the storm over Sens remarks should stop as he had apologised. After Sens unconditional apology, there is no point in demanding his recall. Parliament should show magnanimity and forgive him, Singh said. 

 But in the House, party MP Devendra Prasad Yadav demanded Sens recall. Sens remarks are irresponsible and objectionable. He should be immediately recalled, the RJD leader said as Lalu Prasad watched in silence.

 Lock-up after vacate order

 If we cant have it, well make sure no one has it either.

 Employees of a state agency, asked to clear out from their office so that the building can house an embassy, locked up their workplace recently in protest against the order.

 The Hyderabad Urban Development Authority enjoys an address many other government offices arent lucky to have it is located inside the historic Paigah Palace.

 The Andhra Pradesh government signed a rent agreement allowing the building to be used as a temporary office of the US consulate. The state agency wasnt left in the lurch: it was offered another spacious building, but the staff refused to move.

 Even the fact that the new location, the Green Lands guesthouse, is only 2km away and would be used as an office only till work on the embassys permanent office is over failed to sway the employees. They locked up the authoritys chairman and vice-chairman in their offices. Police rescued the duo. But the protesters vowed to fight on.

 Rakhi gift for Metro

 The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation celebrated the Raksha Bandhan last week with estimated record earnings. In 2006, the festival saw the collection double from an average of Rs 30-35 lakh a day to around Rs 65 lakh. 

 This year, with a new metro line in operation and several new stations added, the corporation is estimated to have bettered the figure it notched up last year. 

 According to a senior official, the numbers are being compiled and the earnings could well touch Rs 1 crore. 

 Fifty-eight additional trains rolled out on the festival day and the largest number ran on the Dwarka-Barakhamba Road route, which connects west Delhi with the city centre. 

 The record earnings come at a time when Delhi residents have had to cope with the dwindling number of buses, especially after the crackdown on Bluelines. 

 Dead man stumps doc

 A book-release programme M. Karunanidhi attended last month left him charmed with the power of the absurd.

 The extraordinary tale was recounted by K. Swaminathan, a well-known voice for the states radio listeners at the event where a collection of poems by K. Vezhavendhan, a poet of the Dravidian movement, was released.

 Swaminathan recounted an anecdote about how some people continue to be men of clay in Tamil Nadu, a theme mirrored in one of Vezhavendhans poems.

 In the story, a mental patient kept insisting to his psychiatrist he was dead. The doctor, struggling to convince him, got him to agree to a simple test: if blood oozes out from his body, he is alive. 

 Then blood did seep out after a finger prick, the doctor looked up triumphantly and asked: Do you believe me now? The man retorted that he was a true doctor, having managed to draw blood from a dead man.

 Swaminathans story had the chief minister, himself a writer, in splits and raving about his lucid presentation.

 Power punch

 Power users can hope to be spared regular shocks inflated power bills with unfailing regularity.

 Private companies feeding Delhi were criticised in Parliament by MPs who wanted electricity distribution handed back to government-run entities like the Delhi Vidyut Board that was wound up.

 Many members blamed the firms for faulty billing while doing little to ensure that residents are sparred erratic supply. Worse, they want to raise tariffs. That will be another shock.

 Nine months on, AXN heat singes Centre

 ASHWANI TALWAR

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: Worlds Sexiest Commercials, the cheeky show that got a two- month ban slapped on the channel AXN, hadnt actually been offending anyones good taste for several months now.

 Kunal Dasgupta, CEO of SET India, which distributes the channel in the country, said AXN had taken the programme off the air last April, soon after the information and broadcasting (I amp;B) ministry warned that it was in bad taste. So the sudden ban yesterday was quite a shock, he said.

 The ministry admits that the programme was not being aired for some time, but defends its decision. Officials argue that the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, allows them to order a ban particularly when a channel refuses to heed warnings and has been a repeat offender.

 The officials say there was nothing sudden about the decision: AXN had sufficient opportunities to explain why punitive action should not be taken against it. 

 The ministry issued letters, postponed meetings with channel executives at their request and even put up with AXNs absence at a scheduled hearing at least once.

 An inter-ministerial committee saw a recording of Worlds Sexiest Commercials. But the committee did not specify the penalty to be imposed.

 AXN is not commenting on its next course of action, but the ministry said a legal representative from the channel met officials today.

 Apart from moving court, the channel can seek a review. In the past, the ministry has put on hold action ordered against other channels. 

 But the entertainment industry is asking why a compilation of sexy commercials should invite a ban in the first place. 

 Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt recalled the fuss over the fashion channel FTV during the NDA governments tenure. FTV, however, escaped being banned by then I amp;B minister Sushma Swaraj by cutting down on show of cleavage.

 Over the past several years, only half a dozen channels have been taken off the air under government instructions, though many more have been served warnings for offensive content. Such notices have gone out 203 times over the last couple of years, with some channels ticked off more than once.

 About a third of these cases related to obscenity, officials say. Others broke the programme code grounds ranging from contempt of court to hurting religious sentiments. The government can also take action over any programme that contravenes the Cinematograph Act, 1952.

 The banned channels include Blue Kiss, Blue Kiss Express, Blue Kiss Promo, TBL XXX and X-TV. Unlike AXN, they were blatantly pornographic.

 As for Worlds Sexiest Commercials, Dasgupta says: Only the title is offensive, the programme is quite tame. 

 A viewer recalls that more than nudity, the show had naughty dialogue and visuals, often with double meaning.

 An old promo says: Featuring the best commercials from around the world, these ads are here to prove that sex sells, with their tongue placed in cheek. 

 The government acted under section 20 (2) of the Cable Television Act which allows it to ban any channel or programme if it thinks it is necessary to do so in the interest of public order, decency or morality. It can take the same action under this law if the issue concerns the countrys sovereignty, security or its friendly relations with any foreign state.

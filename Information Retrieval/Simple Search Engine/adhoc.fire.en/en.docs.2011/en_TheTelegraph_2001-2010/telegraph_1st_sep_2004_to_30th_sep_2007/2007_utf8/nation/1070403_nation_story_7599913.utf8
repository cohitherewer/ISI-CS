The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 NRI surgeons pill for Indian healthcare

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Dr Sheo Tibrewal

 Calcutta, April 2: At a time India is attracting Western patients in search of affordable but quality healthcare, a British Indian doctor has approached Delhi with a plan to upgrade the countrys health tourism potential.

 Dr Sheo Tibrewals outline skeleton, which he has handed to the Union health ministry, also looks at ways to reach quality healthcare to rich and poor Indians alike.

 The London-based orthopaedic surgeon has been an independent professional adviser to the Ombudsmen and National Health Service and, more recently, to the Healthcare Commission of Great Britain.

 His prescription for turning India into one of the leading exporters of health education, training and services is simple: standardise the postgraduate (PG) education and training system.

 With standards now differing from state to state and university to university, healthcare across India now happens to be variable and patchy, Dr Tibrewal, a Padma Shri awardee this year, told The Telegraph from London.

 He has advised Delhi to set up a national postgraduate medical education and training board, which will draw up the curriculum for every medical speciality for every state.

 Dr Tibrewal wants every PG medical trainee to go through two examinations: a degree exam equivalent to the current MD or MS awarded for general medicine or surgery and a second one at the end of five years of speciality and super-speciality training.

 Currently, a doctor doing PG needs three years (after internship) to complete his MD or MS. The two-year course in a super-speciality is optional.

 Dr Tibrewal, whose mentoring of outstation doctors in the UK has been recognised with a British national award of excellence, will meet President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam during a trip to India next week to discuss the proposal further.

 Im also keen to work with the Bengal government to try and ensure that the poor get a basic standard of treatment, he said.

 Here, too, he feels the solution lies in standardisation: all healthcare services should be brought under a national framework, applicable across the states. Benchmarks should be set for all basic clinical care, including emergency services, the length of waiting time, standards of care and audit of the care provided.

 He also believes that India needs to do much more in the field of prevention.

 Dr Tibrewal, who received a Pride of India Award from the NRI Institute at a recent function in London, and his co-workers were the first to accurately define the movements at each level of the lumbar spinal segments by using bi-planar radiography.

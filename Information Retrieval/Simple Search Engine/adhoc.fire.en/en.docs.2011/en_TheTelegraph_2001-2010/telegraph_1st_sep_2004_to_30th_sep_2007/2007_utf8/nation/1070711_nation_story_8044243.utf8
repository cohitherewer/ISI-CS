 Buzz in Big Cities 

 BlackBerry trap for road rogues

 The Garden City is getting a taste of BlackBerry in a novel way. And its the traffic offenders who are finding it sour. They will no longer be able pull the wool over the eyes of policemen. If they dont get you, their palmtops will.

 Drivers prone to jumping lights, parking in prohibited zones, taking U-turns where they shouldnt and speaking on their mobiles are hurtling into trouble. 

 Every time you get flagged down, the tech-savvy policemans BlackBerry will throw up a history sheet. The technology enables the cops to network with the control room and list previous violations. Armed with a small printer, the cop, in whites and khaki, will collect the fine and give you a printed receipt, along with a Thank You note. 

 The police are also working on a concept where three similar offences will be marked on driving licences, eventually lead to a revocation. The system is in place, but more Bangaloreans are just waking up to it. 

 Beast falls to poisoned prey

 One mans meat is another mans poison. 

 But it was a panther that got a taste of the time-tested adage recently. And, it was farmer who bared his claws.

 The hungry beast had torn into a cow that the farmer had left to graze on the fringes of a Coimbatore reserve forest. But the panther left its dead prey at the spot and disappeared, hoping to return for a filling meal when hungry.

 But the farmer, distraught at having lost his cow, decided to hit back and pay the carnivore back in its own coin.

 According to reports from the site, near Mathipalayam Perumal Kovil on the Western Ghats, the farmer smeared poison on the carcass and left it where it was. 

 The panther returned a while later and devoured his meat, which proved to be his last meal. He died soon after.

 Smart pass

 Delhi commuters, especially those who pay for their rides once a month or each quarter, have a smarter ticket to ride.

 The Delhi Transport Corporation has decided to issue computerised passes to its regular passengers, who now make do with manual ones that are easily crumpled or torn.

 The passes, designed by Delhi State Industrial Development Corporation, will be easier to retain and will have an in-built data recovery mechanism. This will help the authorities keep track of validity and prevent tampering.

 The new passes will have in-built software that stores data and helps keep them secure, said Manoj Parida, who heads the company that designed the passes.

 Delhi: Watch children perform their adaptation of Shakespeares eternal ode to tragic love Romeo and Juliet on July 12 at 7pm at the India Habitat Centre. Passes are available at the programme desk. The performers are fresh out of a two-month-long workshop with an NSD expert.

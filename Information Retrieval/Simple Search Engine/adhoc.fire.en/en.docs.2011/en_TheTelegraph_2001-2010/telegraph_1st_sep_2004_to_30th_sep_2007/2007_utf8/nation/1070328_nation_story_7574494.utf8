 Snubbed MP in election revolt

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, March 27: Yogi Adityanath today took another step towards severing his ties with the BJP by announcing he would field 70 candidates against the partys official nominees in 14 districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh.

 The Gorakhpur MP who had spent 11 days in detention after being arrested in January for violating prohibitory orders in the communally sensitive town released a list of 32 names; another 38 will be declared later.

 Adityanaths candidates will officially represent the All India Hindu Mahasabha the 34-year-old MP had succeeded the organisations founder Mahant Avaidyanath in seats across Basti, Varanasi, Mirzapur, Deoria, Azamgarh, Gorakhpur and eight other districts. Elections are too close for him to float a new party. 

 On March 15, the saffron-clad MP resigned from the BJPs national executive to protest the unfair manner of ticket distribution. The party had hoped he would yield to persuasion by leaders like L. K. Advani and Swami Chinmayanand, who wanted him to stay on in the party. Even in his meeting with Advani on March 24, he promised the former party president he wouldnt leave. 

 But intense pressure from his supporters in Gorakhpur appears to have pushed him to go it alone. I had requested the BJP leadership to offer 32 tickets to my supporters from eastern Uttar Pradesh. By rejecting the appeal, they have insulted me, my followers and the very idea of Hindutva, Adityanath said after a meeting with his supporters. 

 The BJP, which released a list of its 317 candidates last week, has tied up with the Janata Dal (United) and Sonelal Patels Apna Dal. Adityanaths opposition to the alliance isnt a secret.

 Kalyan Singh, the chief of the BJP committee finalising candidates for the polls, described Adityanaths decision unfortunate. He was requested by tallest of the BJP leaders not to go on his own. What more can I say? We will approach him again. It is learnt that the former chief minister had agreed to give the MP 15 seats. 

 Singh has been upset with the way Adityanath runs a parallel power centre within the BJP at Gorakhpur, ignoring state leaders. The MP kept away from the partys national executive held in Lucknow in December. He has also stayed off key meetings in Delhi recently. 

 Some in the BJP feel Adityanath will hurt the party in the states eastern regions, but others believe his real strength is being exaggerated.

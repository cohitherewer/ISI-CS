The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Enter, the picky, hi-tech thief

 Hold on to your laptops

 Im so happy they didnt take my gold-and-diamond wedding ring, said Shailaja Mudigonda, a software engineer who works at Cyber Gateway.

 But her husband Suresh is fuming because his computer hard disk, processor and microphone are gone along with the camera he had bought in Australia a month ago. 

 There have been 15 to 20 similar break-ins in the past two months, all at apartments on the outskirts of the city where most of Hyderabads software professionals live.

 We dont know if its a lone thief or a gang. Maybe the high cost of hardware is the reason why they steal only these. Or perhaps a jobless IT professional is carrying out the thefts, an officer at Rajendernagar police limits said.

 Last Sunday, the thieves walked into three locked apartments and picked their choice of gadgets and computer parts a job that would have taken hours.

 They took away my latest Microsoft hardware worth Rs 25,000, said Jagdish Thakur in Kondapur.

 The police are full of admiration for the thieves skill. From a flat in Manikonda, close to the Microsoft and Infosys offices, they took away hi-fi equipment, including a Tata Sky set-top box and a cyber security system, an officer said.

 They removed everything very professionally, bit by bit, without using force.

 The police say the thieves opened the front door by cutting the inside latch with a fine electrical cutter. Then they opened the cupboards and safes using pressure and heat technology.

 Not in a single instance have they forced their way in using bricks or iron rods. They sometimes use a screwdriver or even a spoon, an officer said. 

 Its difficult not to marvel at the skill and technology on display. Every new theft throws up an instance of some new, skilful method.

 The police have organised night patrols and involved residents in their investigations to try and find out if an unemployed computer professional is behind it all.

 Hyderabad is home to nearly two lakh IT professionals and the attrition rate in the industry is believed to be around 25 per cent, far higher than the official figure of 15 per cent.

 The city has emerged a hub for BPO activity and employs around two lakh young graduates. Another three lakh are engaged in the service sector.

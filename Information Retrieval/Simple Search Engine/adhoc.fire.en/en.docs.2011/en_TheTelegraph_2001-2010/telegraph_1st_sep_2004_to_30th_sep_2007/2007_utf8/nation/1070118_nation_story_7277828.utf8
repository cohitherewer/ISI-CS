 US Bengal wart

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 17: Infrastructure bottlenecks are the biggest source of worry for US investors keen on Bengal.

 This is the message from a survey commissioned by the American Chamber of Commerce in India (Amcham). 

 International consultant PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) did the survey on behalf of the chamber, which is an association of American business organisations in India. Around 50 per cent of respondents said physical infrastructure in Bengal isnt up to the mark, said PwC executive director Arindam Guha.

 According to respondents, road, port and airports in the state have to improve to draw investments from US firms.

 A detailed version of the survey will be published tomorrow at the formal launch of Amchams Calcutta chapter. 

 The event will coincide with the chambers first national executive committee meeting in the city. CEOs of US firms like Citigroup, Coca-Cola, Hewitt Associates, Brown amp; Forman, Honeywell International, Knoah Solutions, Interra and PwC will attend.

 The chamber has been in India for 15 years. But this is the first time that we are meeting in Calcutta as interest in this part of the country is growing, said Gulshan Sachdev, chairman of Amchams Calcutta chapter.

 Members of the executive committee will discuss findings of the survey with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Thursday, and tell him about planned US investments.

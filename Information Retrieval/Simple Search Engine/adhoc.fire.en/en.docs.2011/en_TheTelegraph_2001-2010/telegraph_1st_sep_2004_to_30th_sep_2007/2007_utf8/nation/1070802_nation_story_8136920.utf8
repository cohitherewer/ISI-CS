 Haneef holiday cut short

 - Doctor returns after Canberra releases Net chat transcript

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Aug. 1: Mohammed Haneef cut short a holiday and rushed back to Bangalore for a hurried news conference after Australian authorities yesterday released transcripts of an Internet chat to hint that he might have known about the UK terror plots.

 Today, Australian Federal Police commissioner Mike Keelty hurled another beamer, saying Haneef could still face charges over last months botched attacks and a brief of evidence could be submitted against the doctor.

 Haneef told reporters he had been quoted out of context. Let them release the full text of the chat I had with my brother Shoaib, then you will understand better, said the doctor who rushed back from a nearby resort where he had been holidaying with his mother, wife, brother, sister and newborn daughter.

 In any case, my legal team has asked the police to release the full text of the second transcript. There is nothing new in their disclosures. It was not classified secret information, Haneef said.

 In the transcripts of the Internet chat, which Australian immigration minister Kevin Andrews cited as a reason for cancelling the doctors visa, Shoaib urges his brother to leave Australia because nothing has been found out about you.

 At the news conference, Haneef, who reached India late last month after 25 days in a Brisbane jail, said he had decided to speak up as the Australian authorities seemed bent on victimising him.

 But he refused to be drawn into any controversy. He said his legal team had advised him not to comment on any issue as his application to reinstate his work visa was coming up in a court on August 8. 

 Asked if the Australian authorities were releasing information to prejudice his case, Haneef, for a moment, looked as if he wanted to say something but then shook his head.

 This morning, Keelty said the probe was far from over and it was potentially possible that a brief of evidence would be submitted against Haneef, though the terror charge against him had been dropped because of lack of evidence.

 Andrews again defended criticism that he had selectively released details designed to taint the doctors image and cited suspicious phone calls and the Net conversation as reasons for revoking the doctors visa.

 Andrews, however, did not release all protected police information, including the second transcript in which Haneef claims to have answered satisfactorily all the questions put to him.

 In Mysore, the doctors lawyer Peter Russo said the Australian government cannot re-issue summons to Haneef. It is a closed chapter and there is no need to give it a fresh meaning for all that now, he said.

 Bangalore police have asked Haneef to be available for questioning. Sources said they were interested in asking him a few questions regarding his cousins Kafeel and Sabeel Ahmed, both accused in the UK terror plots.

 We will also ask him some questions about the attack on the Indian Institute of Science in December 2005, said an officer.

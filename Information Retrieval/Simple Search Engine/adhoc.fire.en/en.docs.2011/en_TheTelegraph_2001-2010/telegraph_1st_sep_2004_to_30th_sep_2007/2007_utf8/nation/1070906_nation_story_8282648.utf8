 Hyderabad, Sept. 5: Police are on their toes in Hyderabad after a suspect allegedly revealed during a narco-analysis test that three or four explosions were planned in the coming days.

 Syed Imran Khan, taken into custody after the twin blasts on August 25 that killed more than 40 people, also told interrogators eight persons were involved in the attack. Four of them were Pakistanis. 

 Two of the Pakistanis have already left the country but two others are still in Hyderabad, police sources quoted him as saying.

 With Ramazan and Ganesh Chaturthi coming up, the state government is on high alert. It plans to set up CCTVs all along the Ganesh procession route and in Ramazan Bazaar in the Old City. 

 Adding to the scare, large quantities of ammonium nitrate the chemical used in the twin blasts were seized from an oil trader at Jedcharla in Mahbubnagar.

 Imran, a bank executive first taken into custody after the Mecca Masjid blast in May but let off, revealed that RDX smuggled in from Bangladesh was initially stored at Bidar, 110km from Hyderabad. Some of the RDX was later sent to Nalgonda, 105km from the capital. A portion was also sent to Nizamabad, 176km from here. 

 The explosive was used in the May blast that killed nine.

 Special teams of Andhra Pradesh police have been sent to Bidar and Nizamabad to trace the RDX. 

 We are checking all known shelters of the suspects, said Nalgonda superintendent Sujata Rao.

 In Hyderabad, the house of Shahi Rafzana, the Bangladeshi woman who was suspected to have smuggled in RDX, was searched for clues. She was picked up following a tip-off that her brother Rizwan Gazi resembled the sketch of the Lumbini Park blast suspect.

 We found some cycle balls and black bags in their house at Kishanbagh, which more or less cemented their involvement in the bombings, said Reddenna, the assistant commissioner of police, Charminar. 

 A red-corner notice has been issued for another Hyderabad youth, Mohammed Amjad alias Khaja, an alleged key operative of the Harkat-ul Jihad Islami said to be involved in the Lumbini Park blast. He is believed to be hiding in Bangladesh. 

 His name cropped up during investigations into the Mecca Masjid blast.

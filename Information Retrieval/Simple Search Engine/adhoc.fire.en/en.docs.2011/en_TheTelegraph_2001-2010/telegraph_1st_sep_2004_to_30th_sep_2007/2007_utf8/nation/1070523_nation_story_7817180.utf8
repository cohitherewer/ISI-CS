 Tiffin box blasts again

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, May 22: Memories of Fridays Mecca Masjid blast returned as three tiffin box bombs went off within 10 minutes of one another in Gorakhpur this evening.

 But only six people were wounded as the bombs, each tied to a new bicycle, exploded in three crowded market areas, all within a 500-metre radius. Police refused to blame militants, saying local criminal gangs seemed to be responsible.

 I have been told these were crude bombs with bicycle ball-bearings used as splinters. They were not powerful enough to cause heavy casualty, the additional director-general of police (law and order), Brij Mohan, said in Lucknow. 

 The intention seems to have been to trigger panic and show off their muscle to the people and the police.

 Downtown Gorakhpur, one of the busiest commercial districts in eastern Uttar Pradesh, was teeming with evening shoppers when the first bomb went off around 7 pm, senior superintendent of police Rajesh Rai said.

 Five minutes later, a blast rocked the market area around Golghar, a landmark building. The third explosion took place at 7.10 at Ganesh Chauraha, about 100 yards away.

 Sanjay Rai, both of whose legs were bleeding from splinter hits, said he had been walking past Golghar when he heard a loud bang and was thrown to the ground.

 People were running about in panic. As I lay bleeding, I heard another blast from the direction of Ganesh Chauraha.

 Except the toll, there were parallels with last years blasts in Varanasi, also in eastern Uttar Pradesh. On March 7, 2006, also a Tuesday, three blasts in the evening had killed 20 people in the temple town, most of them at the Sankat Mochan shrine.

 Security was tightened tonight around Gorakhpurs Gorakhnath temple, which is believed to be on the hit list of militants, and elsewhere. The city had recently witnessed communal violence.

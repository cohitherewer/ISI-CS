 Bangalore, July 29: Back home after a 27-day ordeal, Mohammed Haneef said he had been victimised by Australian authorities.

 I have been victimised by the Australian government and the drama played by the Australian Federal Police, he read out from a statement at his in-laws house at BTM Layout, seven km from the heart of Bangalore.

 Balloons bursting around him, a garlanded Haneef stepped out of the vehicle that had ferried him from the airport, looked up at his wife Firdous, caught the first glimpse of his baby, Hania, and waved. The entire family had lined up on the first floor waiting for Haneefs homecoming.

 The mild-mannered doctor was flanked by his wifes cousin Imran Siddiqui and her father. Haneef described Siddiqui as the star of the moment.

 Hundreds of Bangaloreans waited outside the airport and at his in-laws home, braving a steady drizzle. The home was decorated with lights and messages were strung from the balcony. Three of them read: Welcome Home, You did it, Imran and Great! Russo, great! 

 Lawyer Peter Russo, who accompanied Haneef and Siddiqui from Brisbane, was dropped off at a hotel. 

 The doctor said it was an emotional moment for me to be with my family. It has been a long wait after 27 days going through the trauma.

 Haneef began reading out the statement by saying: Glory be to God.

 The doctor said he would like to thank his family for their support, the Indian government and the Indian high commissioner to Australia, Prabhat Shukla, lawyer Peter Russo and his legal team. 

 He also thanked supporters in India, Australia and throughout the world and the media which supported me in India and worldwide.

 Siddiqui said Haneef would not take any questions tonight and would address a media conference tomorrow.

 Haneef flew from Brisbane to Bangalore after making a short stopover in Thailand. At the Bangalore airport, he was quickly shuffled by police into a car waiting to take him home, where a celebratory feast, including chicken biryani, was being prepared.

 Haneef, who looked relaxed and was smiling, muttered please, please as he tried to make his way through the mob of reporters. 

 Its like a festival for us today, Haneefs brother Mohammed Shoaib said.

 What can give a mother more happiness? My child is free and he is coming home, Haneefs mother Qurrainthullain said as she passed around sweets to cousins and neighbours gathering at her home before he arrived.

 Weve always known that he was innocent and now everyone else knows it too, Haneefs sister Sumayya said. Its been a year since weve last seen him and this last month has been so traumatic for us. Were all waiting to finally meet him. My brother has suffered so much this past month.

 In an emotional interview broadcast on Channel 9, Haneef had iterated he had no knowledge of his relatives alleged involvement in the failed British attacks.

 Appearing close to tears, Haneef said if he had suspected his relatives Sabeel and Kafeel Ahmed were planning bombings in Britain, he would not have kept it to himself.

 I would have let the parents know first, who are the main sufferers now, Haneef said. I really feel for them.

 Reporters at Bangkoks Suvarnabhumi International Airport asked Haneef how he felt to be free.

 Fine, thank you, he replied, giving a thumbs-up sign.

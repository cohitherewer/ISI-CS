 Dera regret not enough

 Chandigarh, May 20: The Akal Takht today rejected the Dera Sacha Saudas expression of regret over a controversial advertisement and demanded the closure of the sects branches in Punjab. 

 The decision by the highest temporal body for Sikhs came after the government filed a case against the sects head, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, for intention to outrage religious feelings. Gurmeet was portrayed in the advertisement in attire that made him resemble Guru Gobind Singh.

 A meeting of the Akal Takht that began in Amritsars Golden Temple today ended with a call for a Punjab bandh on May 22. 

 Those who took part in the talks included Akal Takht head priest Joginder Singh Vedanti, Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee chief Avtar Singh Makkar, chief minister Parkash Singh Badals special emissary Daljeet Singh Cheema and Sant Samaj members. 

 We want closure of the Deras branches by May 27. The CBI probe against Gurmeet should be completed by May 30, Vedanti said. 

 The Akal Takht will organise a march to Chandigarh from Fetehgarh Saheb, 50 km away. The protest will end at the homes of the Punjab and Haryana governors, who will be given a memorandum detailing Gurmeets actions. 

 Todays meeting did not discuss a dharma yudh against Gurmeet something the hardliners want but decided to send representatives to meet the President, Prime Minister and home minister as part of its efforts to get Gurmeet punished in the cases that have been filed against him by the CBI. 

 Vedanti appealed to followers not to indulge in violence during protests. The bandh and the march will be peaceful. The law will be respected, he said. Another Akal Takht meeting is likely on May 31.

 Damdami Taksal chief Harnam Singh said he was satisfied with the outcome of the talks. We iterate that we are not against Deras followers. It is their head Gurmeet who has enraged us by his acts. We mean no harm to the followers.

 The case against Gurmeet was registered in Bhatinda before the Akal Takht meeting. He has been charged with deliberate or malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings. 

 The case followed a complaint from Rajinder Singh Sidhu, president of Bhatindas Khalsa Dewan and Sri Guru Singh Sabha, and a police inquiry.

 A Dera spokesperson said the organisation would take legal steps to ensure its branches in Punjab are not closed.

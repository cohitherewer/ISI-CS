 Dean resigns after attack on colleague

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Panikkar: Not alone?

 Ahmedabad, July 7: Deepak Kannan, the fine arts dean at M.S. University, resigned yesterday, minutes after his suspended colleague Shivaji Panikkar was attacked.

 The resignation of professor Kannan coincided with the attack on professor Shivaji Panikkar, but he resigned because of his differences with the university authorities, said a senior member of the MSU faculty. 

 The resignation has not been accepted, said vice-chancellor Manoj Soni. I hope he will continue to function as dean.

 Soni, however, refused to explain why Kannan had put in his papers.

 Kannan playing mediator between the agitating students, teachers and the university said he took the step because his image was being tarnished by the Sangh parivar which claims he is favourably inclined towards Panikkar.

 Kannan had condemned Panikkars suspension and termed it illegal, which had irked the university authorities. Moreover, the mediation efforts have not been successful.

 The suspended professor had been acting dean of the fine arts faculty when Kannan, the actual head, had been away in the US. 

 According to I.I. Pandya, the president of the Baroda University Teachers Association, Kannan resigned because he had been told to get a written apology from Panikkar, but he had refused. He was also being pressurised to declare the result of the fine arts students, which is delayed by over two weeks.

 The vice-chancellor, when asked about the possibility of revoking Panikkars suspension, claimed that efforts were on. Our senior faculty members are talking to him.

 But Panikkar says he feels demeaned. Why is he sending syndicate members to talk to me? Why cant the vice-chancellor himself come forward to break the impasse?

 Pandya said he has sought Governor Naval Kishore Sharmas intervention in instituting a judicial inquiry.

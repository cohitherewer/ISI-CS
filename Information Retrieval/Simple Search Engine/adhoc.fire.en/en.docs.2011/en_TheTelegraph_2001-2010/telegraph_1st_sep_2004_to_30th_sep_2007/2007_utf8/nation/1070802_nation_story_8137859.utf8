 Homemaker to helm of Gujarat chamber

 BASANT RAWAT 

 Paru Jaykrishna

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 1: Paru Jaykrishna has become the first woman to head the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 17 years after she made the transformation from housewife to entrepreneur.

 Paru, who turns 65 on Sunday, said she felt honoured not because I have been able to storm the male bastion but because the coveted post gives enormous opportunity to translate ones vision into reality to do things one always wanted to do for the larger interest of the state.

 In 1999, she had joined the chamber as its first elected woman member. 

 Nine years before that, Paru had decided to go into business a decision that shocked her conservative in-laws. When she married Mrugesh Jaykrishna, whose family owned six textile mills, she had given up her job as a lecturer to become a housewife.

 But in 1985, when 60 out of 64 textile mills closed down in Ahmedabad once called the Manchester of East she was worried about the future of her sons, then 16 and 17. While they had land and a big bank balance to fall back on, all six mills owned by the family had closed.

 The first thing I did was that I sent both my sons to US to study finance and marketing, she said. Paru had decided that when her sons returned they came back in 1992 she should have set up a business for them. 

 Her father-in-law was shocked, but eventually she was allowed to go ahead on the condition that she would raise her own funds. I accepted the challenge, said Paru, who then hired Gujarat Industrial and Technical Consultants to prepare a business model that would be 100 per cent export-oriented. 

 While textile mills were dying, the chemical industry was booming at the time. With a Rs 5-lakh subsidy from the state government, she took a Rs 21-lakh loan from the Gujarat State Finance Corporation to set up her chemical plant.

 I began my company from scratch in 1990, which has now become a Rs 200-crore company (Asahi Songwan Colours), she said. The company has a collaboration with firms in Korea, Japan and Germany and exports to 28 countries. 

 Parus husband has joined her as well. Their marriage in 1964, too, had raised eyebrows. She was a Jain born into a humble family and lost her father at seven. He was a Patel from an affluent business clan. 

 A Jain marrying a Patel was unthinkable in those days as the two communities were fierce business rivals. But my in- laws were broadminded, so they had no problem accepting me as their daughter-in-law, said Paru who lives with her husband, mother-in-law, two sons and their wives and children in a farmhouse near Ahmedabad airport.

 As chamber president, she has her plans chalked out. Our aim is that by 2010, (when it celebrates its golden jubilee) Gujarat should really become golden in the true sense, she said.

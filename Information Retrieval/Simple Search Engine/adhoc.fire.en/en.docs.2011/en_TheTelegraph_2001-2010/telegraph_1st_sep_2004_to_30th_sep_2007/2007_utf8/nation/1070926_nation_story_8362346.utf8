 A Cong thorn in birthday book bouquet

 MANDIRA NAYAR 

 Dev Anand

 New Delhi, Sept. 25: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is scheduled to unwrap a touchy era in Congress history tomorrow when he releases the first full-fledged autobiography of actor Dev Anand.

 In Romancing with Life: An Autobiography, Anand minces no words about the Emergency and writes in great length about the over-ambitious tree-planter of a young fellow whose only qualification as a politician was the blessings of his mother (Indira Gandhi). 

 The Prime Minister, according to an agency report, is expected to be flanked by Congress president Sonia Gandhi at the book release.

 This is Singhs first public appearance after his surgery. Singh has a lot in common with Anand. Apart from their Pakistan connection they are both from undivided Punjab they will turn a year older tomorrow together as they share their birthday.

 The book, published by Penguin India, says Sanjay introduced a reign of terror and the culture of wheeling-dealing into the political system. 

 Invited to a youth rally led by Sanjay in Delhi, Anand describes the event as an overzealous, over-passionate exercise being conducted by Congress stooges to sanctify Sanjays succession to the gaddi. 

 The actor adds: It seems their propaganda machinery was functioning on almost fascist lines, trying to use every possible means to bring the image of Sanjay Gandhi into adoring focus. 

 Vehemently opposed to making a statement about the Youth Congress on television with special reference to the dynamism of its leader after the rally Anand claims all his pictures were banned from being screened on television. 

 The Congress should, however, be happy with Anands comments about Rajiv Gandhi. 

 Despite Rajiv not giving him an audience when the actor released a book on the politician written by a history professor Anand says he returned to Bombay only after having praised the young dynamic leadership of the new Prime Minister.

 Rajiv had the courage and strength and age on his side to take India forward with its head held high, he writes. 

 From a generation of actors who rose to fame in newly independent India and could not remain detached from politics, Anand has his fair share of opinions on the actors of the other more powerful stage. 

 When Indira Gandhi declared the Emergency, her image shattered in my mind, like the minds of the majority of her countrymen. Probably she had become a prisoner of her coterie of advisers and fortune-seeking friends, in her aloofness from the people that mattered, writes Anand.

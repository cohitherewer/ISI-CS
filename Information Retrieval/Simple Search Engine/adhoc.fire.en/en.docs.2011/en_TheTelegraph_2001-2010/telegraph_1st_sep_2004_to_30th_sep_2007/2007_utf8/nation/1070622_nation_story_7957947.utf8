 Painting probe

 New Delhi, June 21 (PTI) The Congress today said it had ordered an internal inquiry into the depiction of party chief Sonia Gandhi as goddess Durga allegedly by a party leader in Uttar Pradesh.

 The general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh has been asked to inquire into the matter, AICC spokesman Janardhan Dwivedi said.

 If any Congress worker is found to be involved, the party will expel him, he added. 

 A painting portraying Sonia as goddess Durga in the party office in Moradabad took everybody by surprise.

 The work of art, as termed by Congress district president A.S. Soni, was created by a painter who hung the sample piece from a wall at the party office during the recent Assembly elections. 

 He then asked party workers to contact him if more such paintings were required.

 Clumsy Gere is sorry, but cop says its too late 

 - Tangoing to trouble

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A still from Shall We Dance. 

 New Delhi, April 27: Richard Gere has apologised for the pecks he planted on Shilpa Shettys cheek but police in the Pink City cant wait to get their hands on the Hollywood charmer. 

 A Jaipur court yesterday asked for Geres arrest on a criminal complaint filed by a local lawyer and summoned Shilpa to explain what it reportedly described as co-operative behaviour during the kissing episode.

 The judge is believed to have called the kiss at a recent HIV/AIDS awareness programme in the capital highly sexually erotic.

 Gere, who finds himself at the centre of a storm of protests by self-proclaimed guardians of Indian morality, today said he had never intended to hurt the sentiments of any of my friends in India.

 What is most important to me is that my intentions as an HIV/AIDS advocate be made clear, he said in a statement released to the media by Project Heroes an AIDS awareness programme he supports. 

 But Geres apology is not enough for the Jaipur police and they are now busy preparing to send notices across the seas if required. 

 His apology now is of no use. Everyone... including the judge has seen what happened. I will have to follow the courts order and arrest Gere, Jaipur (City) superintendent S.C. Kalla told The Telegraph. 

 Kalla said he had not yet received the arrest warrant from the court, but was ready to move into action once it arrives. The warrant carries the address of the accused and the court is trying to ascertain Geres address. That is why it is taking time, but we should have it by tomorrow.

 He said the police once they receive the warrant would approach the ministry of external affairs to help them bring Gere to India. 

 Although the charge of obscenity section 294 of the IPC is bailable, neither Shilpa nor Gere have applied for anticipatory bail. 

 The Hollywood actor, who had yesterday told an American television channel that his kissing the girl on the cheek was nothing, today said he was taken by complete surprise at the media storm that followed the kiss. 

 I would hope that the media could now end the circus around this episode and dedicate its positive resources and expertise to the eradication of HIV/AIDS and other preventable diseases, said Gere. 

 He called his impromptu pecks a clumsy attempt at a dance move from his 2004 hit Shall We Dance ironically, his initial attempts at learning ballroom dancing from Jennifer Lopez in the movie, too, are clumsy. 

 The attempt, he said, was a naive misread of Indian customs, and nothing more.

 The evening and event in question was intended to celebrate courageous people and partnerships in the supremely important fight against HIV/AIDS, a worldwide pandemic that has afflicted over 5 million Indians and is still increasing, he said, adding that he felt sorry for Shilpa. 

 Ive felt terrible that she should carry a burden that is no fault of hers. The burden is mine and no one elses.

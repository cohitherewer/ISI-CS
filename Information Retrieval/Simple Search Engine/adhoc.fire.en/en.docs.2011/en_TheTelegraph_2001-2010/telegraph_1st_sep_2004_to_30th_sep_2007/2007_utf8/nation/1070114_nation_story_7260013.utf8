 Mulayam in a quandary

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 13: Five days ahead of a crucial Assembly session, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister is trying to make up his mind whether to press for a confidence vote or to recommend dissolution of the House.

 Earlier this week, the 14-member Rashtriya Janata Dal, a partner in the ruling coalition, decided to pull out of the government and sit with the Opposition in the Assembly.

 As Samajwadi Party strategists weigh both options, Mulayam Singh Yadav (in picture) appears to be of the view that a confidence vote would serve his party better than dissolution of the Assembly, though this would allow him to continue as caretaker chief minister.

 Mulayam sees a trust vote as a win-win situation. If the government wins, it would not only survive the crisis caused by the resignations but also blunt the Centres alleged bid to impose Presidents rule in the state, sources said.

 The government can lose only if most of the Independent MLAs, who are presently supporting it, join the ranks of the Opposition along with the Congress and the RLD.

 If this happens, the Congress, RLD and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) would all get bracketed with the BJP martyr Mulayam could then project his party as the only one fighting saffron forces in the state, sources said.

 This would help him regain the confidence of the minority voters, sources said. A shift in a section of the minority community away from the Samajwadis in the past few months has been worrying Mulayam. 

 A section of Samajwadi Party leaders are of the opinion that some Opposition parties might walk out instead of voting against the government in the trust vote to avoid being bracketed together. 

 At the moment, the numbers are in favour of Mulayam, even minus the RLD and the Congress, which has been backing the government from outside. Out of the current Assembly strength of 401 members, 213 are still on Mulayams side.

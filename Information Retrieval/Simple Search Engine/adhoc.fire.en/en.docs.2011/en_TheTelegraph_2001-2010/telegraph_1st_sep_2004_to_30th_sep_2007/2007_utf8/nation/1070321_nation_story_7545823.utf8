 Four more point at Jon

 March 20 (Agencies): More trouble is in store for Indian-born fashion designer Anand Jon Alexander, who is accused of rape, with four more women levelling sexual assault charges against him.

 The prosecution in Los Angeles yesterday slapped 13 criminal charges on the 33-year-old for a range of sexual offences following the complaints from the women, including a 17-year-old girl. 

 The total number of alleged victims, prosecutors said yesterday, are now seven.

 Jon, who has dressed celebrities,was charged earlier this month with rape and a string of sex crimes on three people two women and a 15-year-old girl. He is now in jail and will appear in the Los Angeles country superior court on April 4. If convicted, he could face life imprisonment.

 The complaint alleges that the crimes occurred between March 2004 and March 2007.

 He (Jon) lured these girls to be models and sexually assaulted them, said Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles county district attorneys office. This is an ongoing investigation and we believe there may be numerous additional victims.

 Authorities in New York have opened a similar investigation, Robison said. We continue to receive phone calls from people who are potential victims, Beverly Hills police Lt Mitch Mccann said.

 Some of the alleged assaults occurred this month at Jons Beverly Hills home. These girls fly in for model jobs after months of dialogue filled with flirtation. They have sexual interaction, and if he doesnt put them in the show, they claim they had unwanted sex, Jons attorney said.

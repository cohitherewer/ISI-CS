 Bangladeshi woman held in Bangalore

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Sept. 3: Another Bangladeshi woman, reportedly a relative of detained Vellore medical student Shahi Rafzani, was tonight picked up from a Bangalore home.

 A police team lying in wait for Shahis brother Rizwan Gazi, said to resemble the sketch of one of the Lumbini Park bombing suspects, unexpectedly bumped into her on Bannerghata road this evening.

 The woman arrived in a car with an accomplice almost three hours after the team of Andhra and Karnataka policemen started keeping watch on the house. 

 She has been detained for questioning and is likely to be brought to Hyderabad tomorrow. The 21-year-old youth at the wheel fled. 

 We had gone to Bangalore in search of Rizwan Gazi but we got this woman, a member of the special investigation team said over the phone from Bangalore. 

 Depending on how senior she is in terrorist circles, we would also like to subject her to a narco test.

 The police had similarly run into Shahi, a 27-year-old student of Vellores Christian Medical College, on Saturday and taken her into custody on the suspicion of ferrying RDX from Bangladesh to Hyderabad. They had found her at Gazis Hyderabad home.

 Earlier, Interpol Delhi wrote to Interpol Dhaka seeking its help to verify details about alleged blast architect Mohammed Sharifuddin who was reportedly arrested in Bangladesh today.

 Reports coming out of New Delhi claimed Sharifuddin, who operates under the aliases Abdul Hamza and Kanchan and allegedly had a hand in the explosions at the Lumbini Park and a fast-food joint, had been picked up near the Bangladesh border.

 Senior Bangladesh police officers, however, said they had no information about the arrest. The Andhra government and the police, too, refused to confirm anything.

 We have no information on Hamzas arrest, said Hyderabad police commissioner Balwinder Singh.

 The police suspect that Sharifuddin masterminded the blasts along with Mohammed Shaheed alias Bilal, the south India chief of the Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami. He is also believed to have had a hand in the May Mecca Masjid blasts.

 Although the report about the alleged Bangladesh arrest created a flutter, people are scared and angry that the police have not made much headway. 

 I used to go shopping alone in the lanes and bylanes of the old city with my children, said Malleswari, a homemaker from Chikkadapally. But I am scared now.

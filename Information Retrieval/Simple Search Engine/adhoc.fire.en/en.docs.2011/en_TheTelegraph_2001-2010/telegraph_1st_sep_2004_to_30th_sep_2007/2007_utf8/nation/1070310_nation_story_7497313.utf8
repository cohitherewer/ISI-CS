 Srinagar, March 9: Violence swept Srinagar today after a mob stormed a hotel, alleging it was being used as a brothel, and apprehended some of its girl visitors and set ablaze several vehicles parked outside.

 The incident led to clashes between police and the protesters believed to be from the Forum Against Social Evils an alliance of several social and separatist groups fighting against immoral activities.

 The protesters raided De Meridian hotel in the congested Sarai Bala locality this afternoon, ransacking it and smashing furniture. Hundreds of people, including women, converged on the scene, shouting slogans against the government and those allegedly behind the immoral activities there.

 Some persons, believed to be activists of the forum, allegedly dragged at least two girls out of the hotel. They threw a cordon around the girls to protect them from the mobs rage and put them in a waiting autorickshaw, which whisked them away to an unknown location.

 When the police arrived on the scene, the protesters threw stones at them. The police had to resort to a cane-charge.

 Srinagar police chief Ahfad ul Mujtaba blamed hooligans for the attack. Around half-a-dozen people have been arrested in this connection and a case has been registered, he said. Complaints, if any, of any alleged immoral activity in the hotel will be looked into.

 The police said they were not aware of any girl being detained by the hooligans.

 The Dukhataran-e-Milat, a constituent of the Forum Against Social Evils, denied any role in the incident but praised the peoples action. We had dispatched our team to the spot but before they could act, people had taken action on their own, said Dukhataran chairperson Asiya Andrabi. It is a brothel and it is good to see people fighting such immoral acts.

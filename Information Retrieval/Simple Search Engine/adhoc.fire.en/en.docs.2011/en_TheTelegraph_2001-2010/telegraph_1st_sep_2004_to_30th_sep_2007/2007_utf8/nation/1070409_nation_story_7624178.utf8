 Trafficking cuffs on NRI couple

 London, April 8 (PTI): An Indian-origin couple has been convicted of running a racket to smuggle Indians into the UK and are expected to face a long imprisonment.

 Rani Paul Kashyap, 44, and her 51-year-old husband Joginder were convicted in the Stafford Crown court last week for breaching immigration law between February 2003 and March 2005. The Tamworth-based couple will be sentenced at Birmingham Crown court next month. The court had indicated that the couple might face long imprisonment.

 Mark Wall, the prosecuting lawyer, said the Kashyaps run the racket from their legitimate firm in Birmingham. He said the company Sonia and Sunny Entertainments was set up to supply Indian entertainers in the UK. 

 But it was used in part as a front to help people come into this country who were not genuine entertainers, he added.

 The smuggled people were mostly from Punjab and used to enter as musicians or dancers. The way they tried to persuade the authorities they were genuine people was to provide genuine dates in Britain along with documents. But many of the bookings for these bogus entertainers were forged to mislead the authorities. They applied for group work permits and supported people who applied to the British High Commission in New Delhi, Wall said.

 Once they had visas and work permits they were able to come to this country and many of those people just disappeared, the prosecuting lawyer added.

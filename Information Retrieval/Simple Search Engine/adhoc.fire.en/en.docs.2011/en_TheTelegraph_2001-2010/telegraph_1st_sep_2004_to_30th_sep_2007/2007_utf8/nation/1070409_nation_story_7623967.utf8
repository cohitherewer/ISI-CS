 Gone in a day, call to raise H-1B cap

 Washington, April 8 (AFP): The US high-technology industry is renewing its call to expand the H-1B visa programme after the quota for the coming year was filled in a day.

 Launched in 1990, the H-1B programme allows foreign scientists, engineers and technologists to be employed for up to six years in the US, at the end of which they must obtain permanent residency or return home. About half come from India.

 The programme providing 65,000 visas was opened and closed on April 2 after some 150,000 applications were received.

 US tech companies complained that the filling up of the quota so quickly highlights a need for urgent reforms. America must have access to the worlds best talent if we are to compete in the global economy, said Phil Bond, president of the Information Technology Association of America.

 Because of the flood of applications this year, the visas for the fiscal year starting October 1 will be given in a random selection process, and employers who fail to get visas for their prospective employees will have to apply next April for the fiscal year starting in October 2008.

 Last month, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates told lawmakers: Unfortunately, Americas immigration policies are driving away the worlds best and brightest precisely when we need them most. 

 But critics of the programme say few companies use it for the stated purpose of attracting the best and brightest.

 Ron Hira, a professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology who specialises in engineering workforce issues and technology policy, said there are loopholes in the visa process that make it hard to know if there is indeed a shortage. Companies dont have to look for US workers first, and in fact could displace American workers with H-1Bs.

 Hira said the median wage for H-1B visa holders is $50,000 so its not the $100,000-a-year software engineer some people talk about.

 Although companies are required to pay a prevailing wage, Hira said this is not necessarily a market wage, and in fact most will get lower wages than an equally qualified US worker.

 Democratic Senator Dick Durbin and his Republican colleague Chuck Grassley have introduced legislation aimed at tightening the standards to give priority to American workers.

 The Durbin-Grassley bill would require that jobs be advertised for 30 days before an employer may submit an H-1B application. The measure also would prohibit employers from hiring H-1B employees who are then outsourced to other companies and would bar companies from new visas if over 50 per cent of their employees are H-1B visa holders.

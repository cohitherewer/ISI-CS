 More pay for lost baggage

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Air benefits

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: Passengers flying into or out of India can soon hope to get higher and quicker compensation for death, injury, loss of baggage or delays.

 The Indians among them will also be able to file their claim from India even if the journey was undertaken and the ticket bought outside the country as long as the carrier has a presence in India.

 A bill, likely to be tabled in the upcoming budget session, provides these benefits by amending the Carriage by the Air Act, 1972. It would bring India under the Montreal Convention 1999, a global treaty on international carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo.

 Non-accession to the convention by India may give rise to serious discrimination between passengers of the same flight with regard to compensation, Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said.

 For instance, (if India does not accede to the Montreal pact) passengers whose journey originated in the US or Britain would be entitled to much higher compensation compared with those whose journey originated in India.

 Not only will airlines be now forced to pay higher compensation to international passengers to and from India to avoid lengthy litigation, such passengers will also have the fifth jurisdiction option.

 Before the Montreal Convention, passengers or their legal heirs had four choices of country for filing claims: the place where the ticket was issued, the airlines principal place of business, the passengers destination and the carriers place of domicile. The Montreal Convention adds a fifth choice: the passengers place of domicile, provided the airline has a presence there.

 The earlier options came under an international legal regime, the Warsaw System, which governs the liability of airlines for injury or death of their passengers and destruction, damage or loss to baggage and cargo. It also covers losses caused by flight delay or delay in delivering baggage or cargo.

 In 1994, the International Civil Aviation Organisation had begun an initiative for a socio-economic study of compensation levels, following which the Montreal Convention was adopted in 1999, unifying all aviation rules.

 An offer that can cement ties

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 4: A day after the UPA government cut all import duties on cement, Pakistan has announced it wants to sell the product to India.

 The Indian government, nose-thumbed by cement-makers who have refused to reduce prices despite requests, yesterday removed the 16 per cent countervailing duty and 4 per cent special additional duty on cement. It had earlier reduced basic import tariff from 12.5 per cent to zero.

 The move was seen by analysts as a bid to punish domestic cement-makers.

 Today, the Indian government got a shot in the arm, courtesy its neighbour. Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz made the offer to sell cement to his counterpart Manmohan Singh at a meeting on the sidelines of the Saarc summit.

 Sources said Pakistani cement would land at Mumbai port at Rs 200 for a 50-kg bag and even less in Punjab. as against Rs 220-240 charged by Indian manufacturers.

 The cement industry put up a brave front. The abolition of duties would make import of cement cheaper by around Rs 22-23 a bag, but it would still be higher than the domestic price, said A.K. Saraogi, the chief financial officer of JK Cement.

 Pakistan, which produced around 17.5 million tonnes of cement in the first nine months of this fiscal, is already selling cement to India. In February, it had exported 18,600 tonnes across the border. 

 Analysts said the duty-cut is expected to increase sales, especially if the Pakistan government agrees to transport cement to Punjab and Gujarat by road.

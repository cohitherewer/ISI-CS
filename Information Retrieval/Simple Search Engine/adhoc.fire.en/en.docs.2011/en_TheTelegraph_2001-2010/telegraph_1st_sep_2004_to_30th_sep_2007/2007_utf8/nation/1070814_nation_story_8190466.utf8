 Now, visit India for luxury trip

 AMIT ROY 

 The backwaters of Kerela

London, Aug. 13: India has for the first time edged into the Top 10 for long-haul luxury destinations, apparently because of the publicity generated by Elizabeth Hurleys flamboyant wedding to Arun Nayar in Mumbai and Rajasthan earlier this year.

 Based on advance UK bookings for 2008, India is now No. 4 on a league table compiled by Kuoni, a travel company that claims to offer a wide range of tailor-made holiday types and package holidays in over 65 countries. 

 This represents a steep climb for India, which was placed at 13th position in 2005 and ranked No. 12 in both 2006 and 2007. 

 An Indian journey has long been a rite of passage for young British backpackers either during their gap year or immediately after leaving university.

 Hurley cannot claim all the credit for Indias upward movement but her wedding excesses, which were exclusively and extensively featured in Hello! magazine, did get the country acres of coverage in March.

 On the principle all publicity is good publicity, she has not harmed Indias cause, nor has Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty, self-appointed ambassador for 5,000 years of glorious Indian culture.

 A luxury holiday usually means having to spend more than 3,000 per person. 

 Kuoni, which describes itself as Britains best known long-haul luxury holiday tour operator, confirmed that for 2007, the top destination was, once again, Thailand, with Dubai second, the Maldives third, Malaysia fourth and Egypt fifth.

 Vietnam has moved from 19th place last year to 14th this year, with Kuoni predicting it will rise further next year. Sri Lanka is the top place for weddings abroad for Britons this year, followed by Mauritius, Thailand, the US and Canada. 

 The favourite honeymoon destination is Thailand, followed by Mauritius, Dubai, Malaysia and Sri Lanka.

 Kuoni said many travellers were now more conscious of green issues: The green credentials of top hotels are being scrutinised by many discerning travellers as closely as the labels on their food. 

 Destinations promoted in India include Agra (much to see and appreciate than just the Taj); Delhi (a fascinating introduction to the myriad sights and sounds to be found in the subcontinent); Goa (one of Indias most irresistible destinations); and Kerala (long, sandy beaches, spice and tea plantations, extensive and fascinating backwaters with lagoons and millions of coconut trees).

 Iran allays nuke fears

 OUR BUREAU 

 Khatami

 New Delhi, March 23: Signalling a major softening in its bid to pursue nuclear weapons, Irans former President Mohammad Khatami has said Irans goal has never been to have access to nuclear weapons and he would guarantee that Iran would not be a threat to any other country.

 Khatami also pointed out that India should not be nervous about Pakistans assistance to Irans nuclear programme, that this would never be a threat to India or to any other country.

 I give you a guarantee that Iran would never like any country to be a threat to any other country, Khatami said.

 Khatamis presence in the capital, two days before India and the US begin their first round of talks on framing a bilateral nuclear energy agreement, is significant because it attempts to allay a variety of political misgivings in India, especially on the part of the Left parties, that the Manmohan Singh governments foreign policy is succumbing to US pressure. 

 Conversely, the red carpet treatment to Khatami he would never have got a visa if New Delhi wasnt fully on board on this media invite also strengthens New Delhis hand in pushing for a reduction in the high price of gas that will flow if Iran, Pakistan and India agree to building a gas pipeline in the future.

 Even as US energy secretary Samuel Bodman has warned against any economic collaboration with Iran, US embassy officials in Delhi insisted that there was no link between the Iran pipeline project and the nuclear energy talks between India and the US beginning on Sunday. 

 We dont want to precipitate a major disagreement with India, a US embassy official said, adding: Both of us want to keep this inside a reasonable box so that we can explore what to do.

 Khatami sought to reassure his audience that Irans scientists were pursuing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and that science should not have any limits, and that everyone should have access to it.

 He added that he would give a guarantee that this technology would never be a threat to any country....

 At the two-day technical-level talks between India and Pakistans petroleum ministries in the capital today, India has made it clear that unless Pakistan brought down the transit as well as the tariff fees, the gas pipeline project would not be economically viable.

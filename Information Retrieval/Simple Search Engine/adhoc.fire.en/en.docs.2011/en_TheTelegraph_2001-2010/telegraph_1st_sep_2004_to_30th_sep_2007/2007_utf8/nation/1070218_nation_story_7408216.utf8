 Malegaon probe

 Mumbai, Feb. 17: The CBI today told the special court conducting the trial in the Malegaon serial blasts case that it would be soon taking over the investigations.

 The agency also told the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act court that it would be registering a fresh FIR in the case. 

 On September 8, four blasts in the town killed 31 people and injured over 200. 

 The Congress and the Muslim clerics of Malegaon had demanded the CBI probe, casting aspersions on the performance of the anti-terror squad.

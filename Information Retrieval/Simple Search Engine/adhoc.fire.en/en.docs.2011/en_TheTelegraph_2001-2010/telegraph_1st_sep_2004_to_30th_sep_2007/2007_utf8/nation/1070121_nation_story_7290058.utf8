 Poll penalty for top cop

 Virk

 Chandigarh/New Delhi, Jan. 20: The Election Commission last night removed Punjab DGP S.S. Virk following allegations by the Shiromani Akali Dal and the BJP that the state police chief was working as a poll agent of the ruling Congress.

 The Opposition also claimed there was a deal between chief minister Amarinder Singh and the officer over the proposed Rs 240-crore Chandigarh International Convention Centre to be set up by Virks brother.

 Akali Dal leader Parkash Singh Badal had alleged that Virk, whose close relations with Amarinder are well known, had been rewarded with the mega project in return for helping the Congress in the February 13 Assembly polls.

 The poll panels order follows Amarinders assertion last week that Virk would not be removed or sent on deputation to the Centre. We need him till the polls are over, he had said.

 Today, the chief minister described the commissions decision as a matter between the panel and the police chief. It is not a setback for the party, he added.

 Virk was not available for comment.

 The Election Commission has also directed state chief secretary K.R. Lakhanpal not to involve Virk in any poll-related duty and appointed R.S. Gill as the new DGP. 

 Earlier this month, however, chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami, while reviewing the states poll preparedness, had rejected the Akali Dal demand to transfer the officer. But he had warned Virk that action would be taken if he was not found to be neutral and fair.

 The chief minister today filed his nomination from Patiala. His son Raninder also filed his nomination as a covering candidate.

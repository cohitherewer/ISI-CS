 Bengali Dosar in Bollywood bash

 Bradford, June 9: After conquering Cannes less than a fortnight ago, Rituparno Ghoshs Dosar became the first Bengali film to be screened at the IIFA awards after seven years. 

 And while the audience count at Screen 2 of the Cineworld multiplex in Castleford was hardly half full, there was a buzz around the only regional Indian film to be screened at the three-day Bollywood celebrations in Yorkshire.

 A Bengali cinema hardly moves beyond Priya cinema, so this is truly exciting, Ghosh told The Telegraph. 

 When we made Dosar, we were hopeful about its prospects but after its Poila Baisakh release last year, nothing really happened. In between, I finished three films and Dosar really was dead and gone. But now, with the back-to-back screenings at Cannes and IIFA, it has got a new life.

 Dosar, which revolves around the life of a couple after the husbands lover dies in an accident, features Prosenjit and Konkona Sen Sharma in the lead. Both were present alongside Ghosh for the green-carpet walk at the plex. 

 This is my third visit to the IIFA awards. The first time I had come was for the screening of Mr amp; Mrs Iyer, Konkona revealed. Dosar was a breeze, shot 9-to-5 in just 14 days. We never really felt like we were working. And now to have the film travelling to these festivals across the globe is a pleasant surprise. 

 This is, of course, a first for Prosenjit and he made the most of the occasion by appearing in a Sharbari Datta dhoti-kurta ensemble. 

 It feels great because IIFA is essentially a celebration of mainstream Bollywood cinema, and for a Bengali film to make a mark like this is truly splendid, he said.

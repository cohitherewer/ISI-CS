 Disaster calling: Tired drivers

 Safety at stake on Mumbai lifeline 

 ANANYA SENGUPTA 

 TOO MANY TRAINS, TOO FEW MOTORMEN 

 December 13: Anil Chainchkar rams his local into a stationary train near Thane. His automatic warning system is switched off.

 December 14: A Borivali-Churchgate local leaves without its guard, P.K. Chaudhury, while he was in the toilet. The motorman at the drivers end responds to a bell operated by a constable of the Railway Protection Force. He should have responded to the call of his colleague.

 January 4: A Churchgate-Virar local overshoots the Kandivali station, where it is supposed to halt, by 220 metres. Commuters jump from the moving train and trudge back.

 These are no false alarms. They are warning bells from overworked drivers (motormen) of Mumbais overcrowded local trains. Officials arent prepared to accept that its because of stress arising out of a long days grind. But they dont have other reasons to offer, either.

 Motormen are convinced the lapses are the result of stress. Whichever side wins the argument, its the lives of commuters and the confidence in the railways thats lost. Typically, 3000 lives are on the line. Thats the number of people each rush-hour local is crammed with.

 While theres a dispute on too much work, both sides agree that theres, indeed, a shortage of motormen. This is true of Western Railway (WR) and Central Railway (CR). 

 Against WRs sanctioned strength of 351, there are only 325 motormen on its rolls. With 1100 locals everyday, that works out to more than three locals to a motorman. The ratio is actually higher because on a given day, some motormen are off duty, while others are on leave. 

 Things are tighter in Central Railway, which runs 1212 locals daily. Its running short of about 100 motormen.

 A Western Railway official concedes there arent enough hands, but points out that most railway departments are coping with problems of inadequate numbers.

 Vacancies take a year to be filled. By the time the new employees arrive, the vacancies shoot up yet again. If we require 100 people, we are sometimes given only 60. Theres no concept of a waiting list. Many aspirants opt for other jobs rather than wait a year, the official said. 

 The stringent selection procedure for motormen also means most applicants dont make the cut. Many vacancies in Western Railways werent filled even after recent exams conducted by the railway recruitment board. The aptitude and medical tests are tough to crack for most.

 We have to be very careful while recruiting a motorman. So many lives are in their hands. Their physical abilities are closely scrutinised. Their eyes and their hearts should be in good condition. We have to set high standards, after all so many people depend on them. These men qualify through a process more stringent than that put in place for an IPS officer, the official said. 

 So, till the tough tests bring in nothing but the best, the worst could lie ahead for the harried Mumbai office-goer.

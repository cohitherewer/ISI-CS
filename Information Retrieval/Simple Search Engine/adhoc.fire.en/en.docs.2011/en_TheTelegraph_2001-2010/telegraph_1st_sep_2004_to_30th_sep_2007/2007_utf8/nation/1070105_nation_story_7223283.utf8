 Navjot unsure? BJP looks to Navjot

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Sidhu

 Chandigarh, Jan. 4: Navjot Singh Sidhus wife also called Navjot could contest the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat he vacated last month after being found guilty of causing the death of a man in 1988.

 The BJP is seriously considering fielding her, a senior state unit leader said. The bypoll is scheduled for February 13, the day Assembly elections will be held in Punjab. 

 The cricketer-turned-MP, who faces three years imprisonment in the road rage case, has moved Supreme Court.

 If the Congress names Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs younger brother Surjit Singh Kohli for the Amritsar seat, the BJP would field Sidhus wife, the leader said. 

 There is no one better than Sidhus wife to face a relative of the Prime Minister. In any case, she is the right person to carry on the good work that her husband has begun. Even if Sidhu goes to prison and we cannot field her for some reason or the other, she will be our prime campaigner against chief minister Amarinder Singh in Patiala, the BJP leader said. 

 Sidhu said: There are some indications that she could be considered and she seems open to the idea. But it is the prerogative of the party to field anyone it feels. Both of us have not had a serious discussion yet, he said. His wife is a doctor in Patiala.

 He accused the Amarinder government of causing a loss of Rs 132,000 crore to the state by selling fertile farmland in Mohali.

 Party misses Pramod as Sena strays

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, June 26: The Shiv Sena says it supports Pratibha Patil for President because she is from Maharashtra, but long-time ally BJP is not impressed.

 If the BJP fields a Bengali, will the CPM support him? asked BJP leader Sushma Swaraj.

 The party, she said, was pained by the Sena decision because Presidents should not be elected on the basis of regionalism.

 The BJPs top guns in Maharashtra, Gopinath Munde and Nitin Gadkari, were more blunt as they accused the Sena of betrayal and deal-making with the Congress.

 Sushma steered clear of such allegations, saying the priority now is to get votes for Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, contesting as a BJP-backed Independent. We will review our ties with the Sena after the presidential election.

 Old-timers say one man could have papered over the cracks and got the Sena behind Shekhawat Pramod Mahajan.

 From indulging Thackerays illogical whims and his foibles Mahajan gifted him a tiger-shaped beer mug which he picked up from South Africa only to find that the Sena chief had taken to sipping wine and later recompensed for the slip-up by giving him expensive wine glasses from East Europe to second-guessing his political moves, the BJP leader ensured the alliance stayed.

 Now, neither Gadkari nor Munde, Mahajans brother-in-law, have his patience, pragmatism and the art of articulation in which a message can be sent across without sounding harsh.

 The question haunting many in the BJP is who will step into Mahajans shoes. We know we cannot fight the Lok Sabha elections solo, but we need someone who can deal deftly with the allies, a BJP general secretary said.

 The party isnt exactly spoilt for choice. 

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee is out of reckoning, L.K. Advani is fighting to save his suzerainty from being poached by the younger leaders and the RSS, M. Venkaiah Naidu couldnt deal with the Telugu Desam or the Telengana Rashtra Samiti in Andhra Pradesh and Ananth Kumar reportedly riled ally Janata Dal (Secular) in Karnakata. 

 Sushma is also not seen as much of an alliance builder. 

 That has left party chief Rajnath Singh to handle this tricky area. And looking at his persuasive skills with the Trinamul Congress, sources say, he doesnt seem up to the job.

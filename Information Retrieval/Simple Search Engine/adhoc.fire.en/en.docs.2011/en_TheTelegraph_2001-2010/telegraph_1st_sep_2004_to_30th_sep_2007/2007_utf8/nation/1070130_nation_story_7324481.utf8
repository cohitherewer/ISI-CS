 Poor English finger at Indian pupils 

 Mind your language

 Melbourne, Jan. 29 (PTI): Australian universities said they will toughen English language requirements for foreign graduates after a study released today highlighted poor language skills among over one-third of overseas students completing university degrees, including Indians.

 According to the report by Melbournes Monash University, 34 per cent of students granted permanent residency after graduating from an Australian university last year were unable to achieve a competent English standard in their tests. 

 It found that about 17 per cent students from India and Singapore each failed to reach the required level.

 It said that more than 24 per cent Pakistani students fall in this category, while 42 per cent Bangladeshi and 47 per cent Nepalese students have little knowledge of English.

 Over 50 per cent South Korean and Thai students could not meet the required English levels. Among Chinese students, the figure was 43.2 per cent.

 The government is assuming that the various pathway programmes they do once they get there will bring their English up to the standard. But these results indicate that is not the case, demographer Bob Birrell, the author of the study, said.

 Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee chief Professor Gerard Sutton said a toughened language requirement, jointly developed with the immigration department, will come into effect in July 2008.

 Sutton rejected any suggestions that universities had lowered standards to allow fee-paying overseas students who contribute around 15 per cent of university revenues to graduate. 

 He said only students with adequate reading, writing and listening skills in English could pass university exams.

 There are 239,000 foreign students in Australia. About a third will seek to stay and work a process encouraged to meet skills shortages.

 Tony Pollock, who administers the International English Language Testing System in Australia, said: Language competency and communication skills should be embedded in the curriculum and should be tested and examined in exactly the same way as the content of the professional and general disciplines.

 According to the report, one in three overseas students granted permanent residency after graduating from an Australian university does not have adequate English skills to handle a professional job.

 Almost 12,000 graduates, all from Asia, were tested for the survey, published in the journal People and Place.

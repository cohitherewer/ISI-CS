 Cloud on cell towers

 Radiation hazard?

 New Delhi, Sept. 5 (PTI): The 

 Delhi government has asked the Centre to enact a law to 

 regulate mobile phone towers.

 The towers, suspected of emitting harmful radiation, have recently mushroomed in the capital.

 There are around 3,000 towers of cellular service providers and every day one or two are being installed. But there are no defined standards for safe radiation levels or data on the level of radiation being emitted from them, a senior Delhi government official said.

 In the absence of any legislation, the government cannot take any decision on the issue, the official said, recalling that some villagers had recently resisted installation of a tower in their neighbourhood.

 Although draft guidelines have been prepared by the Telecom Engineering Centre and are under the consideration of the department of telecom, the official said that given the clout that cellphone manufacturers enjoy, it is not easy to tighten the noose around them.

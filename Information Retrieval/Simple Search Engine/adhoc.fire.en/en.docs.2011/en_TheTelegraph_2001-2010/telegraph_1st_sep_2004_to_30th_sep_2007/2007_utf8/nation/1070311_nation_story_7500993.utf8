 Big Brothers big bullies go scot-free

 Shilpa and Jade: Nothing official 

 London, March 10: Jade Goody and the gang which heaped abuse on Shilpa Shetty on Celebrity Big Brother are off the hook police have decided not to charge any of them with racist behaviour.

 This decision, announced yesterday, will not come as a surprise since Shilpa, having initially suggested she was the victim of racism, promptly withdrew the charge and has stuck to that position. 

 Jade apologised again for her behaviour on a recent trip to India and made a 25,000 donation to a childrens charity. Her mother, Jackiey Budden, has faded into obscurity (thoughShilpa and Jade: Nothing official she has been menaced by Asian gangs), while Jades 19-year-old boyfriend, Jack Tweed, has so far kept out of trouble. Some viewers thought Jack had called Shilpa a f****** Paki. Channel 4 disputed this and maintained the word had been c****. But later, a member of the production crew alleged that in footage, which was not shown, the word Paki was used. 

 It is understood Jade and Jackiey were advised by their lawyers not to cooperate with the police. But Jade said: Im pleased with the decision, perhaps we can now all move on. 

 Model Danielle Lloyd, 23, who had spoken continually about her footballer boyfriend, Teddy Sheringham, 40, on the show, appears not to be going out with him any more, though in the world of nightclub-attending celebrities such relationships get attached or detached with bewildering rapidity.

 The singer, Jo Meara, 27, has not come out of depression and apparently has been, on and off, on suicide watch. Danielle and Jo were interviewed by the police, though, in the presence of their lawyers, as was Shilpa. The police also spoke to American singer Jermaine Jackson. 

 But Shilpa has clearly decided there is little point in further humiliating her former tormentors when they are so clearly down and out. 

 Max Clifford, who replaced Jazz Barton as Shilpas representative after her victory, said: This is exactly what we expected. It wont take anybody by surprise. But millions of people saw and heard for themselves so I suppose thats the nearest well get to justice.

 Ofcom, the broadcasting watchdog, is due to report its findings next month. A parallel review by Channel 4, the broadcaster, is also looking into the processes and decision-making of its executives and those of Endemol, the production company.

 Although thousands of viewers, especially Asians, remain convinced that Shilpa was subjected to racism, there was no chance of mounting a successful prosecution if the victim went into the witness stand in court and insisted that the police had got it all wrong and she was not a victim. 

 However, such was the outcry over the reality television programme, with 45,000 registering complaints to Ofcom, effigy burning in Patna, junior external affairs minister Anand Sharma expressing deep anger on behalf of the Indian government and even Tony Blair commenting on the row in the Commons, the police had to conduct an investigation. The Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, claimed the row exposed the ugly underbelly of bigotry in society.

 This probe was conducted by the police in Hertfordshire as this is the county where the Elstree Studios, with its specially-built Big Brother House, are located. 

 Hertfordshire Constabulary conducted an investigation into allegations of racist behaviour within the Big Brother House during Celebrity Big Brother, January 2007, the police said in a statement. These allegations (of racist behaviour) came to light following complaints from members of the public both to Hertfordshire Constabulary and to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom.

 From the start, the Constabulary has made it clear it does not tolerate racism in any form and the allegations were taken extremely seriously, it said.

 The statement went on: During the investigation, it was Hertfordshire Constabularys intention to speak with six of the former housemates. Four were interviewed, however two declined. During the interviews, everybody stated that they had not witnessed or perceived they were victim to any racist behaviour.

 The statement revealed: We also sought the compliance of the production company Endemol and broadcaster Channel 4 in terms of supplying us with unedited footage from the show. They declined to cooperate and stated they would contest any application to court. It added: Following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, it was felt that it would not be in the public interest to effect arrests or to pursue footage through the courts.

 Detective inspector Jeeta Aulak, who ran the inquiry, said: The investigation was balanced, considering all complaints received. During inquiries, we liased with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) this was to ensure that all issues were considered and responded to. The CRE were happy with our response and investigation. 

 Assistant chief constable Simon Parr said: Our investigation has now concluded and a file has been handed across to the CPS. In the absence of complaint from any of the housemates regarding behaviour including behaviour that was not broadcast, the CPS has concluded that whilst what occurred was clearly offensive, it was not criminal.

 A Channel 4 spokesman said: In response to Hertfordshire polices statement issued today, Channel 4 was in an ongoing dialogue with the police and provided them with access to many hours of broadcast programmes. A substantial amount of further footage was requested and our policy, consistent with that of all broadcasters, is to require the police to obtain a court order before such material is handed over.

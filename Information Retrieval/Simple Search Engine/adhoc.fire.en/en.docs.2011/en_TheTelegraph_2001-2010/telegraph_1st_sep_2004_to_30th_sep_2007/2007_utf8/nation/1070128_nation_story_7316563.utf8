 Soldier dies in Sudan 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 27: An Indian Army soldier was killed and two others injured when gunmen shot at their escort vehicle in southern Sudan yesterday even as the UN has sounded out India on availability of more troops in the strife-torn African nation.

 Naik Mohan Singh Gurung, a Nepalese Gorkha, was driving the escort vehicle when he was shot through the head. His co-driver, Captain D.R. Bhattacharya, got a splinter injury near one eye and Rifleman C.B. Rana was also hurt. The soldiers are from the armys 1/5 Gorkha Rifles battalion. 

 The captain and the rifleman have been admitted to a level II hospital in the Sudanese capital Khartoum and were said to be out of danger. An army source said Gurungs body would be flown back to India and then taken to his hometown in Nepal.

 The soldiers were part of a three-vehicle convoy escorting a party of de-miners on a road between Magwe and Opari near the southern Sudanese town of Juba. The incident happened in the area of responsibility of a Bangladeshi battalion with the UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), about 1,000 km south of Khartoum.

 The attack emphasised that Indian soldiers face some of the gravest threats to life and limb in Sudan where the UNMIS is acting under a UN mandate to enforce peace (Chapter VII of the UN charter) that authorises the Blue Helmets to use force to protect themselves and civilians.

 The Indian contingent is acting for the UNMIS in support of a Comprehensive Peace Agreement worked out last year to end a 22-year-old civil war. The attack comes even as the UN department of peacekeeping operations is carrying out preliminary inquiries to generate more troops for possible deployment in the violent Darfur region of Sudan.

 Insat-4B 

launch 

delayed

 Bangalore, March 11 (PTI): Commercial launch service provider Arianespace has rescheduled the lift-off of the Ariane-5 rocket, carrying Indias Insat-4B and the British defence ministrys Skynet-5 satellites, to early Monday after an operational glitch at the launch pad halted the first attempt today.

 The mission is now set for March 12, between 3.33 am and 4.28 am Indian Standard Time, the European space consortium said.

 The two satellites ride into space was delayed as the heavy-lift mission was put on hold seven minutes before scheduled blast-off from Kourou in French Guiana.

 Arianespace said the mission was postponed to ensure the water deluge system, which provides a high-volume flow to the launch pad, works properly during ignition and lift-off.

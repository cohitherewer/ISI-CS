 Minority massage with double swipe at Rao

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Naula Kothi (West Uttar Pradesh), March 19: Rahul Gandhi today indirectly blamed the late P.V. Narasimha Rao for alienating the Muslims of Uttar Pradesh and destroying the Congress in the state.

 The Amethi MP said the Babri Masjid would not have been brought down if the Gandhi family had been around in 1992 and slammed the 1996 alliance with the BSP as the single-most important reason for the Congresss destruction in the heartland.

 No member of the Gandhi family was active in politics at the time of the demolition, which took place when Rao was Prime Minister. Rajiv Gandhi had died the year before, assassinated by LTTE rebels.

 Rao is also believed to have unilaterally clinched the alliance before the 1996 Assembly elections in which the Congress got only 100 of the 425 seats in undivided Uttar Pradesh while the BSP contested the rest.

 I want to stress that if the Gandhi family was around (in politics) in 1996, the alliance (with the BSP) would not have happened and the Babri mosque would not have been brought down, Rahul, who yesterday kicked off his election campaign in the poll-bound state, told reporters accompanying him.

 Rahul dubbed the alliance with the BSP as a total sellout of the Congress and emphasised there wont be a repeat.

 I will be blunt, he said, responding to questions on the Congresss decline in the state. 

 In 1996, the Congress had a vote share which was 15 per cent more than the BSP. In the 1993 Assembly elections, the BSP vote share looked artificially higher because of the alliance with the Samajwadi Party. In 1996 the Congress sold itself out lock, stock and barrel to the BSP. It damaged the party completely.

 Aware of the significant Muslim presence in west Uttar Pradesh, Rahul recalled: My father once told my mother that if the Babri mosque ever looked like it would be demolished, he would stand in front of it. They would have to kill him first.

 Even today, the Congress holds Rao responsible for doing nothing to prevent the demolition despite reports of huge build-up of kar sevaks in Ayodhya before December 6, 1992, when the mosque was brought down.

 Rahul, who stopped at a dhaba on the way from Meerut to Muzaffarnagar for a packed meal of paratha, aloo papri, toast, sandwiches, lassi and canned Coke, said though caste had some role to play in Uttar Pradesh, it was not the main reason for the Congresss decline.

 One of the main reasons is it has somehow lost the ability to create leaders at the ground level. In reality, the Congress has not been fighting elections in Uttar Pradesh since 1996. In 2002, we neednt have fought. This election will change that. The next election will change that completely.

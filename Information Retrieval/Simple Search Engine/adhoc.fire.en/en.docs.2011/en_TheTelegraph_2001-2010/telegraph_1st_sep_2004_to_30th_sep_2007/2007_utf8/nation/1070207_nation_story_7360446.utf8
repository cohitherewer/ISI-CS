 Mamata turns deaf ear to talks echo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 6: Mamata Banerjee wont speak to the echo of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 The Trinamul Congress leader today launched an attack on Ratan Tata in response to his statement yesterday that he is ready for a dialogue with any reasonable party on Singur.

 Mamata accused Tata, who made a surprise visit to Calcutta yesterday, of working in tandem with the chief minister and the CPM to ruin the future of Bengals peasants.

 Ratan Tata, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and the CPM have joined hands and it appears that their venture (the small-car project) is out to destroy fertile land and the farming community of the state. Tata has simply joined the chorus of anti-farmer slogans raised by the ruling CPM and the chief minister. Tata is an obedient echo of the chief minister, Mamata said.

 The Trinamul chief today vowed to press ahead with her agitation against land acquisition in Singur, saying protests and demonstrations will be staged till the state government returns land to those who did not give consent to the acquisition.

 Let this be clear that Ratan Tatas statement will not make us budge an inch. Our fight for the cause of Singur farmers will continue till land is given back to those unwilling to sell. Land acquired forcibly for the Tata Motors project will have to be returned. Till then, our protests will continue, Mamata said.

 Mamata asked MLA Saugata Roy to make the partys stand clear by saying that Tatas remarks will have little bearing on Trinamuls course of action in Singur.

 The state Congress found no problem with Tatas remarks that he was willing to have a dialogue with any reasonable party but insisted that the onus lay on the state government to find a solution.

 Ratan Tatas attitude is positive and we welcome it. The aggressive mentality of the state government is posing a problem and Tata has nothing to do with it, Congress MLA Manas Bhuniya said.

 Mumbai, April 22: Blame it on the sunset and Amar Singhs medical condition.

 Amitabh Bachchan today apologised for the manhandling of journalists outside his house by security guards, saying the entourage was in a hurry because of a time-bound ritual and Amars sudden illness.

 Soon after returning from his trip to Tirupati with the newly-weds, Bachchan not only apologised to the media in general, but also offered to personally make an apology to a lensman who had to be hospitalised after the scuffle with the security guards.

 I deeply regret what happened at my home yesterday. But there was a reason we had to get Aishwarya home before sunset as per ritual and we got delayed due to heavy traffic on the highway. We were in a hurry. 

 To add to this, Amar Singh had a medical condition and we had to rush him home so that he could be attended to by a doctor. While all this was going on, the media blocked our way and in our hurry, things got out of hand.

 I would like to apologise with folded hands for the incident. It is an occasion of happiness for us and we dont want anyone to face problems due to this. I dont want anyone to hold negative vibes for the family, Bachchan said.

 He did not elaborate on the medical condition of Amar, who did not accompany the Bachchans to Tirupati today.

 Yesterday, three photojournalists were allegedly manhandled by security guards escorting the car carrying Aishwarya and Abhishek. One of the photographers, B.L. Soni, fell unconscious and was taken to hospital. 

 Initially, there was confusion whether the security guards were NSG personnel protecting Amar or private guards hired for the wedding. 

 But Bachchan said: They werent my personal security guards. They were Black Cat commandos of Amar Singh, deployed for his protection. Since he was with us, they swung into action. He and his security personnel have gone but I would like to apologise.

 When journalists requested Bachchan to let the media get a glimpse of the newly-weds, the superstar dodged the question.

 This is a personal event, and I would like to keep it private. With your blessings, the wedding happened without a hitch and I thank you all for your cooperation. As far as Abhishek and Aishwarya are concerned, we will release a picture of them together soon, he said.

 The journalists present during the scuffle outside Prateeksha have lodged a police complaint against the security personnel allegedly involved in the attack. 

 Senior police inspector Pradeep Shinde of Juhu police station promised action against the guilty.

 Soni was released from hospital last night after a check-up.

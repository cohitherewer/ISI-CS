 Industry recoils at caste order

 GARIMA SINGH

 New Delhi, March 7: India Inc. is not happy offering details on employment of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in annual reports for 2006-07, as demanded by the government.

 We dont get into caste and creed when we employ people. We do it on the basis of merit and capabilities. Also, we dont want to make our employees aware of caste. Its unfair, Biocon chairman and MD Kiran Mazumdar Shaw told The Telegraph.

 Ajay Dua, secretary in the department of industrial policy and promotion, has written to chambers asking them to ensure that member-companies mention the number of SCs/STs recruited in the first three months of this calendar year. 

 Duas February 23 letter has been sent to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) and Assocham. 

 The industry, fearful of being coerced into employing SCs/STs, is complaining about lack of data. K.K Swamy, deputy managing director of Toyota Kirloskar Motors, said: I am sure we have employed suitable and deserving people. Some of them could be SCs/STs but we dont have data on these lines.

 Bajaj Auto chairman Rahul Bajaj said, as a matter of principle, he had no problems in submitting the data, but argued there would be companies that might not have recruited in January-March.

 Ficci president Habil Khorakiwala said he doesnt understand the logic behind employing a given number of SCs /STs. Companies have voluntarily started taking steps to ensure employability. However, firms do want to insulate themselves from this theory of divisiveness in employment.

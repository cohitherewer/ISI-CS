 Jaitley thrust into heat of CD battle

 New Delhi/Lucknow, April 9: The BJP today fielded former law minister Arun Jaitley to plead its case before the Election Commission, indicating it realised how serious the threat of de-recognition had become.

 The commission, which had served the BJP with a show-cause notice, today began its hearing on whether the party should be de-recognised over an anti-Muslim CD circulating in Uttar Pradesh.

 The poll panel had issued the notice on its own, but today several parties sent petitions asking that the BJPs recognition as a political party be scrapped on the ground of inciting communal passions. These include the Jan Morcha, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress.

 The BJP, which claims the CD was not authorised by the party, has so far made light of the threat of de-recognition in public. But the move to send high-profile lawyer Jaitley to the commission today betrayed its growing anxiety.

 At the hearing, the party repeated that it hadnt authorised the CD and made two further points:

 The commission is not empowered to de-recognise parties. The Representation of the People Act only allows it to set aside candidates election if their party violates election law.

 The Supreme Court has held that once the election process starts, even the courts cannot interfere in it or halt it. So, no decision on the BJPs de-recognition can be taken while the polls are under way.

 The party, sources said, also argued that election commissioner Navin Chawla should be removed from the hearing because of his obvious political bias against the BJP, which had filed a petition last year for his dismissal from the commission. 

 The next hearing is on April 11.

 In Lucknow, the BJPs efforts to cash in on the CD controversy by courting arrest fell flat with the police refusing to take its leaders into custody.

 The leaders had marched to Hazratganj police station, where a first information report has been registered against BJP president Rajnath Singh and candidate Lalji Tandon under the poll panels orders. The march was led by Rajnath and other senior leaders, including L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi.

 We insisted we should be arrested in connection with the FIR but the police refused, state BJP chief Kesrinath Tripathi said.

 State police boss G.L. Sharma said there was no question of arresting the BJP leaders before the FIR is investigated and a prima facie case made out.

 Advani said the Election Commission had overreacted to the allegations from the BJPs rivals and should have carried out a probe before deciding on the FIR.

 Sources said Virendra Singh, the director of the company that produced the CD, today told the police that the disc was prepared under the guidance of the BJPs cultural wing.

 Saharanpur superintendent of police R.K. Chaturvedi said a fresh FIR had been drawn up after Singh alleged he had received death threats.

 Ulfa strikes after PM leaves

 OUR BUREAU 

 Jan. 17: As the army scoured the jungles along the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border for Ulfa militants, an explosion in a crowded marketplace close to the seat of power in Guwahati signalled the militant groups intention to strike back with a vengeance. 

 The Prime Minister was in Guwahati yesterday. 

 One person died and 18 people were wounded in the explosion in the market at the eastern end of the Ganeshguri flyover. An improvised explosive device was planted in a vendors vegetable basket and triggered around 6.30 pm, when the market was teeming with shoppers.

 The vendor, Jagtaran Devi, was critically wounded. Some of the wounded people were admitted to a nearby nursing home and the rest to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital. 

 The only casualty, a man in his twenties, could not be identified immediately.

 Earlier in the day, a blast rocked Goalpara town but did not cause any damage. The site of the blast is a stones throw from Goalpara Circuit House. 

 The explosions during the day were the first signs of retaliation by the Ulfa since the army intensified operations against the militant group. They came two days after chief minister Tarun Gogoi announced that he would be taking over the reins of the Unified Command for counter-insurgency operations from the chief secretary. 

 Intelligence agencies have been warning of violence by the Ulfa in the Lower Assam districts with the army focused on Upper Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. 

 Arunachal Pradesh police today confirmed that several Ulfa militants and supporters have been arrested in that state. Director-general Amod Kanth said areas frequented by militants have been identified and neutralised.

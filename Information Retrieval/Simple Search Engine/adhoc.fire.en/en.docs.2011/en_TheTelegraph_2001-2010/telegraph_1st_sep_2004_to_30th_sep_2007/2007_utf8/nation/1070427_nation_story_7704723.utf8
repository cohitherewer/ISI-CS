 Allies play to quota script in House

 - Parties urged not to stall Parliament

 OUR BUREAU

 Pranab Mukherjee, who attended Parliament on Thursday for the first time since his accident earlier this month

 New Delhi, April 26: As they tried to find a quota quick fix on Wednesday afternoon, the UPAs fire-fighters got an apocalyptic warning: a million volcanoes will burst.

 The doomsday-like message was delivered in a letter DMK boss M. Karunanidhi had written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and human resource development minister Arjun Singh on Tuesday night.

 Reservation is in our blood, the letter said, warning the Centre that an agitation was inevitable, unless the Centre acted quickly to redeem the situation arising out of the Supreme Courts refusal to lift its stay on OBC quotas in institutes of higher education.

 Sources said the last thing Pranab Mukherjee and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi wanted on the opening day of the second leg of the budget session were protests from UPA allies. 

 Das Munshi, the parliamentary affairs minister, proposed to Mukherjee that the DMK and the PMK be invited to talks. It was agreed that the Rashtriya Janata Dal and Ram Vilas Paswan would also be part of the meeting. The aim was to devise ways in which the leaders could express their opposition to the stay without offending the judiciary.

 At the 8 pm meeting just before the cabinet took up the quota issue DMK ministers T.R. Baalu and Dayanidhi Maran privately shared their concern with the government on holding up the IIM admission lists. But what do we do? If we dont raise our voices, the PMK and the ADMK will steal the thunder, a source quoted the two ministers as saying. The RJDs problem was that if Lalu Prasad didnt speak up, his OBC politics might be hijacked by Nitish Kumar and Paswan.

 A big worry is that allowing the leaders to speak their minds could send negative signals to the Supreme Court, which has offered some relief to the Centre by advancing the hearing on the quota issue to May 8. There are also fears that the NDA might capitalise on the cracks in the ruling coalition and add to the confusion.

 The leaders were told they could protest the stay on reservations during the Lok Sabhas zero hour, but without forcing an adjournment. If there was an adjournment, they were urged not to stall the House when it reconvened. 

 The government is keen to get the finance bill passed in both Houses before finance minister P. Chidambaram leaves for Washington on May 4. That is the reason we will sit even on Saturdays, Das Munshi said.

 This morning, when the proceedings began in the Lok Sabha, it looked like the script was enacted to the last letter. The only deviation, said a source, was the manner in which the RJDs Devendra Prasad Yadav attacked the judiciary. But, while others werent as belligerent, members cutting across party lines wanted the OBC quota to be enforced from the coming academic session.

 Speaker Somnath Chatterjee asked agitated members not to cast aspersions on the apex court, saying: I believe just as we are entitled to respect, so are they (the court).

 Not too late to save heart

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, June 30: Changes in eating habits and lifestyle adopted only after the mid-40s can substantially reduce the risk of heart disease, according to a new study that shows that even middle age is not too late to do the right thing for the heart. 

 The study by US researchers has shown that people who adopted heart-friendly lifestyles between the ages of 45 and 64 had 40 per cent lower risk of dying from heart disease and 35 per cent lower risk of cardiovascular incidents such as heart attacks. 

 The findings, to be published in The American Journal of Medicine next month, show that four specific lifestyle changes eating at least five helpings of fruits and vegetables daily, exercising at least two-and-a-half hours a week, reducing weight, and not smoking appear to be enough even for middle-aged and elderly people to benefit. 

 Most studies have typically highlighted the importance of initiating healthy habits early in life. 

 The findings emphasise that middle age is not too late to act, Dana King, professor of family medicine at the Medical University of Southern California, and co-authors have said in their research report. 

 The researchers screened the health of over 15,000 men and women who had switched to healthier living habits only after they were past 45 and found that the benefits were evident within four years and even with only modest changes in eating and exercise habits. 

 Although several studies over the past two decades have shown that heart disease tends to occur earlier among Indians than in Western Caucasian populations, doctors said the new findings would be relevant to Indians, too. 

 The risk factors for cardiovascular diseases increase as age advances, said Prashant Joshi, professor of medicine at Nagpur Medical College. 

 People tend to slow down, exercise less, and diabetes, weight gain and high blood pressure add to the risk, he said. 

 India already has nearly 30 million people with coronary heart disease, according to an estimate that some doctors have described as conservative. 

 The annual number of deaths in the country from heart disease is expected to touch 4.8 million by 2020. 

 In an independent research, Joshi and his colleagues had shown earlier this year that premature heart disease among Indians could be largely prevented through better eating habits and exercise. 

 The new study only reinforces that there is no age limit for intervention, Joshi said.

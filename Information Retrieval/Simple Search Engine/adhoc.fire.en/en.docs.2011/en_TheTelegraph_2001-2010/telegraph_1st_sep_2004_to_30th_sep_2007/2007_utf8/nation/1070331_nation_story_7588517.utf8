 New Delhi, March 30: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today put defence minister A.K. Antony at the head of a committee that will decide whether the army should pull back, stay put or redeploy in Jammu and Kashmir in the wake of Mufti Mohammad Sayeeds demand for a reduction of troops in the state.

 The army has also been asked to vacate school buildings and orchards where feasible. The Prime Ministers Office said the state government has already initiated action to return several of the properties occupied by the forces.

 Although the army has been against a pullback, its top brass has been trying to balance its assessment with the demands of domestic politics and international diplomacy. 

 A troop cut in the state will give the Prime Minister something to take with him to Pakistan a visit he is keen on even if it is far from President Pervez Musharrafs call for demilitarisation.

 Antony will head a high-power committee that will examine recommendations from two other teams an expert panel led by the defence secretary and a review committee that will study the implementation of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act in Jammu and Kashmir.

 The PMO said in a statement this evening that the committees make up a three-fold mechanism relating to Jammu and Kashmir. This follows a review in consultation with the state. The Centre thought it was necessary to set up the mechanism to examine some of the problematic aspects of the current situation.

 The cabinet committee on security, which met yesterday, reviewed the situation but decided not to respond immediately to Muftis demand.

 But Muftis Peoples Democratic Party, which is the Congresss coalition partner in the state, will still be able to claim that the Centre has responded positively to its demand.

 The vacation of private property by troops and an announcement that an officer would determine which houses and orchards could be returned to their owners and how much compensation could be paid will also mean a small measure of relief for the people of the Valley. This gives Mufti something to return with to the Valley from where the PDP draws its support.

 Army chief General Joginder Jaswant Singh, who took over as the chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee, today, also lent weight to the argument for a reduction of troops in the state. He said violence was less than in previous years. But, he added, the situation in Kashmir as well as in Assam had improved because of the army.

 Asked about the BJPs charge that there has been a silent withdrawal of troops from the state at the cost of security, the army chief said it was part of normal redeployment done much before the demand for pullback was voiced by Mufti.

 The PMO also said guidelines on the functioning of forces would be publicised widely in keeping with the humane approach of the Union and the J amp;K governments. 

 The Centre refuses to accept that its army is not as popular in the Valley as it may be in Jammu and in Ladakh.

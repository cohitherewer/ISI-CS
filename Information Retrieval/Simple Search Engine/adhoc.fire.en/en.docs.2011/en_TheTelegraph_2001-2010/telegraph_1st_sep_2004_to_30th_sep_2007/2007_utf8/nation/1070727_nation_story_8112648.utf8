 Chabewal (Hoshiarpur), July 26: Monica Bedi prayed at a gurdwara this morning, thanking God for her freedom and the first night of peaceful sleep in years.

 It is a new life for me, a new birth. The past was a nightmare. It is the future that I am looking forward to, she said, looking frail but at peace with herself.

 It didnt matter that Monica, once used to the luxuries of life, had to spend the sultry night on a thin mattress. 

 I want to thank God, said the starlet, who arrived at the village last night after her release from a Hyderabad jail. It is because of Him that I could sleep peacefully for the first time in years. 

 The media worried her, as did posers about Abu Salem, but they drew nothing more than a stiff no comments. Later, she shut herself indoors to escape the din.

 Father Prem Kumar Bedi, who accompanied her from Hyderabad to the Punjab village, wanted her to be left alone.

 She is at an extremely difficult crossroad in her life. She now has to make tough choices, one relative said. 

 The comment shows Chabewal has come a long way since 2005, when Monicas deportation with Salem had led many here to disown her and the Bedis. 

 She has paid for her links with the don and should be forgiven, said Gurmail Singh, husband of sarpanch Amarjit Kaur.

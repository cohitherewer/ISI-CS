 PMs balance sheet

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, May 8: As Manmohan Singh wrapped up the paperwork on the eve of filing nomination for re-election to the Rajya Sabha, one thought must have struck him: the political liabilities outweigh his economic assets.

 Sources familiar with the compilation of the list of assets its submission is mandatory while filing nomination papers said the Prime Minister has not acquired any asset since 2004.

 Only liabilities, one said in jest, probably keeping in mind the challenges posed by a pushy Left and unrelenting quota crusaders.

 Singh owns a Maruti 800 of 1996 vintage, a Delhi Development Authority flat in Vasant Kunj and a house in Chandigarh, both of which are rented out to supplement his income.

 The author of economic liberalisation, which fed Indias hunger to lick shop shelves clean, evidently has not fallen prey to the addiction he helped set in. 

 The Prime Ministers savings in bank deposits and postal accounts were built on the salary and pension he earned during his overseas stints first in the UNCTAD secretariat and later at the South Commission in Geneva. 

 Sources close to Singh said he meticulously went through the list of assets, which he will submit before the Election Commission in Guwahati tomorrow.

 The Prime Minister didnt require the help of an accounting hand because he is known to diligently maintain and update his books. Singh was so careful that he ferreted out the papers on the Chandigarh house and the DDA flat and included the bills incurred on construction and fittings. 

 The car was an indulgence of sorts because, as old-timers recalled, once the party was voted out in 1996, Singh would travel to the headquarters in a Fiat. Often it had to be cranked up manually by party workers. 

 This morning, Sonia Gandhi saw Singh off from his residence before he left for Guwahati. The Congress president also ensured that he was given a ceremonial welcome in Assam. Singh will be the first Prime Minister to seek re-election to the Rajya Sabha while in office.

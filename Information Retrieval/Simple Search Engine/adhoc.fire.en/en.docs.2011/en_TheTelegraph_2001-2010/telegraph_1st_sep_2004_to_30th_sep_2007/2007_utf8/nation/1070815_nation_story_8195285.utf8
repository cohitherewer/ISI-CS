 Himachal cloudburst

 OUR BUREAU

 Shimla, Aug. 14: A cloudburst in a village in Shimla district is believed to have claimed at least a hundred lives, though the official toll so far is 12.

 Around 6pm today, a sudden burst from the skies washed away the village of Badhi, in Rampur sub-division, 160km from Shimla. 

 The village was also the site of a hydel power project.

 We cannot ascertain the exact toll as the village is cut off from the main road. Bad weather is hampering rescue work, Shimla deputy commissioner Tarun Kapoor said. 

 Cloudbursts are defined as sudden heavy rain confined to a small area in a 10-20km zone and which lasts for a short time. 

 A heavy cloudburst could mean rainfall of more than 10cm within an hour. The most intense phase may last only half an hour. 

 The deaths from cloudbursts are generally the result of flash floods, which often follow the spell of rain.

 Nuke supply onus on US: Kakodkar

 Kalpakkam, Sept. 4 (PTI): Atomic Energy Commission chief Anil Kakodkar today said India should have the right to import nuclear reactors from Nuclear Suppliers Group countries without any conditions. 

 No post- and pre-conditions should be laid and there is need for clean, unconditional exemptions from NSG guidelines on import of nuclear reactors, he said on the sidelines of a graduation event. 

 Kakodkar (in picture) was responding to a query on the NSG guidelines restricting export of such reactors by the 45-nation group. 

 Reacting to US official Nicholas Burns comment that it was up to India to convince the NSG to provide them with nuclear fuel and light-water reactors, he said it was Americas duty to do so in the wake of the nuclear agreement. We are holding talks with the NSG in this regard, he added. 

 On possible US restrictions on nuclear tests by India, Kakodkar said: We have to look at Indian interests and should be able to carry out our strategic programmes.

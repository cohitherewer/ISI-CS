 Towel in stomach

 New Delhi, Aug. 9 (PTI): A towel was allegedly left behind in the stomach of a 65-year-old woman who was operated upon at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) last month. 

 AIIMS has set up a three-member inquiry committee to probe the allegation.

 Gursharan Kaur, who had a surgery on July 27 to remove gall bladder stones, had been complaining of severe pain in the stomach ever since. 

 Her family said a CT scan at a private hospital revealed that there was a foreign object in her stomach. Kaur underwent another surgery to have the towel removed, they added. 

 When we came to know about the case, the director (P. Venugopal) set up a three member inquiry committee which will come out with its findings in three days, D.K. Sharma, the medical superintendent, said.

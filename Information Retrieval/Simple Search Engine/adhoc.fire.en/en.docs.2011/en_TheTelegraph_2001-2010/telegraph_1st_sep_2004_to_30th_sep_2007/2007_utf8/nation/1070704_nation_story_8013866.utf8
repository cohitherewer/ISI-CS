 Cloud on Ambani skyscraper

 Mumbai, July 3 (PTI): The Maharashtra government has termed illegal a land deal by a Mukesh Ambani company in upscale Malabar Hill in south Mumbai.

 A skyscraper is being built on the land that the government has classified as wakf property. 

 A notification has directed the state wakf board to take back possession of five properties, including the 4,532-sqm plot where the company is building the 27-floor glass palace.

 Antilia Commercial, a company owned by Mukesh, had bought the plot for Rs 38 crore. 

 An inquiry into the land transfer deal has found truth in allegations that the transfer was illegal, according to the notice signed by deputy secretary Avinash Hazare.

 The boards chairman, M.A. Aziz, has been asked to clarify his position on the transactions within 15 days, failing which he can be sacked. 

 The transaction took place before I assumed office, Aziz said. Mukesh could not be contacted.

 The property originally belonged to the Madhavrao Scindia family.

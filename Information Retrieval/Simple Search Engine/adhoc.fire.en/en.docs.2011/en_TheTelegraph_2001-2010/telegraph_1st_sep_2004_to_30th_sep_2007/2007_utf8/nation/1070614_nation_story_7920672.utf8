 Assam pilgrim hub blast

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Guwahati, June 13: Terror returned to Assam after barely a fortnights break, killing one person and leaving over 40 wounded in Kamrup district.

 Around 12.30 pm a bomb strapped to a bicycle went off at the weekly wholesale market in Hajo, a pilgrimage centre for Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists.

 People were busy haggling when suddenly I heard a loud bang. The next moment I fell on the ground and everything went blank, said 32-year-old Abdul Salam. Most of the wounded were vegetable vendors or farmers. Sukur Ali, 55, died on the spot.

 Police believe the explosion was triggered by either Ulfa or a fundamentalist group. Ulfa has denied the claim.

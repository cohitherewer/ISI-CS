 Chandigarh, May 19: The Dera Sacha Sauda tonight expressed regret over the chain of events leading to violence in Punjab and said it never intended to imitate Sikh guru Gobind Singh.

 Earlier in the day, Sikh religious heads sought an unconditional apology from Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, the Dera chief, for hurting the sentiments of Sikhs. He appeared in a newspaper advertisement attired like the tenth Sikh guru. 

 In a statement issued in Sirsa late tonight, the Dera said: We never intended to imitate Guru Gobind Singh and we are regretful of the whole chain of events. It added the advertisement that created misconceptions is unfortunate.

 Todays call for an apology came from the Sant Samaj, an umbrella organisation of Sikh religious heads. Harnam Singh, chief of the Damdami Taksal that Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale once headed, said Gurmeet had insulted the people of Punjab and should apologise before the Akal Takht, the highest temporal authority for Sikhs. 

 He comes from a Sikh family and must appear before the Akal Takht. We will see what to do with him after he tenders the apology and undergoes punishment, Harnam, also the Sant Samaj head, said.

 Harnam, at a news conference with Bhindranwales brother Jasbir Singh Rode, said the followers of the Dera need not fear retaliation from Sikhs.

 The Sant Samaj will tomorrow meet Akal Takht priest Joginder Singh Vedanti, seeking harsher punishment for Gurmeet. He gave Gurmeet 10 days while we asked for his arrest in three days. We want Gurmeet to be arrested by noon tomorrow, Rode said.

 Punjab police today withdrew the four security officers deputed by the previous Congress government to guard Gurmeet in Haryana. 

 The state government has transferred Bhatinda SSP Naresh Arora for failing to comprehend the large-scale attacks by Dera followers.

 CD producer picks holes in BJP claim

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Tandon: Embarrassed

 Lucknow, April 6: The producer of the inflammatory CD that has got the BJP into trouble has challenged the partys claim that it had been made without the consent of its leaders.

 At every stage of writing the CD, the leadership in the state BJP was consulted, the script modified, (words) added and fine-tuned in consultation with them, Virendra Singh, the director of the company that produced the CD, said.

 He added that the film titled UP Victimised was made at the behest of the BJPs culture wing. 

 Officials of the company Bulandshahr-based Fakira Films said they had been given the assignment in December last year. Navin Talwar, a member of the BJP culture cell, had contacted them, saying Uttar Pradesh BJP president Kesrinath Tripathi wanted the CD for the partys campaign.

 The last instalment of CDs was handed over to Talwar in the first week of March, company sources said in Bulandshahr.

 Neither Talwar nor Tripathi could be reached for comment.

 Senior BJP leader Lalji Tandon, against whom the Election Commission filed an FIR today, reiterated his partys stand that its leaders were not consulted. He said some over-enthusiastic party workers were responsible for making modifications in the film and adding undesirable elements to it. 

 The BJP has already taken action against them, suspended them from the party and withdrawn them from the campaign committee, Tandon said. 

 Asked if Talwar was one of them, he said he would not take any names.

 A spokesman for the company, Prabesh Gujjar, said the script was prepared in close consultation with the BJP top brass. But he refused to name any leader. We are a professional group. We have produced what we were assigned to produce, the spokesman said.

 Tandon said he was not blaming the company for the fiasco. We are taking the blame and we are embarrassed by what happened.

 About the FIRs filed against him and BJP president Rajnath Singh, Tandon said he would cooperate fully in the investigation. 

 Police said officials of Fakira Films might be questioned as well. 

 Adesh Kumar, inspector of Hazratganj police station, said though the FIRs name Rajnath and Tandon, all those involved in the production of the film needed to be questioned to probe a possible conspiracy angle. 

 The charges under which the Election Commission has sought prosecution of the BJP leaders are: trying to create communal fissure, misinformation campaign, hurting the sentiments of a community and violating the poll panels code of conduct.

 The CD contained inflammatory remarks against Muslims and references to the Babri Masjid demolition and Godhra.

 The FIRs were registered at Hazratganj police station by Uttar Pradesh chief electoral officer A.K. Bishnoi. 

 Sources in the poll panel said Rajnath was named because he is the president of the BJP, and Tandon because he was shown in TV footage releasing the CD at a news conference in Lucknow.

 Gandhi pole dance gets stick

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 12: The information and broadcasting ministry today cracked down on two news channels for fooling around with the Mahatma, forcing them to apologise.

 IBN-7 and Sahara had picked up an animation clip from the Internet showing Gandhi doing a pole dance. The ministry threatened action as per law against the channels and demanded an apology during prime time.

 Within hours, they obliged, saying they had aired the video not to insult Gandhi but to expose the insult on the Web.

 Our intention is not to denigrate (the Mahatma) but to ensure action on the vulgar and cheap act available for public view, a Sahara spokesman said. IBN-7 said: We are equally hurt and disturbed and share the outrage of fellow countrymen.

 The channels had adopted a critical tone while reporting what they had come across on YouTube. IBN-7 had carried a ticker saying the Mahatma was being insulted and beamed reactions condemning the animation. But for I amp;B minister P.R. Das Munshi, showing the offending video, whatever the context, was not on.

 Under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, anything aired must conform to a programme code. The code opposes anything that offends good taste and decency, or is obscene or defamatory. Also out are suggestive innuendoes and half-truths or material that slanders any individual.

 The man who played Gandhi in the videos, too, apologised but was evasive about withdrawing the footage.

 Hawaii-based NRI Gautham Prasad said: I take sole responsibility for any offence I caused. I apologise to people and encourage people not to view the videos.

 Mumbai, Jan. 4: Bucking the trend of witnesses turning hostile in cases involving celebrities, a man today testified that he had seen Salman Khan driving a Land Cruiser that mowed down a bakery employee and sped away in 2002.

 If the witness sticks to his stand during cross-examination, it will deal a body blow to the actor, who has been trying to live down the image of Bollywoods bad boy for some time now.

 Examined by the prosecution before the Bandra metropolitan court this evening, Kalim Mohammed Iqbal, one of the four injured in the hit-and-run episode, said he saw Khan stepping out of the vehicle after the accident and leaving the spot.

 The actor, who has been granted exemption from personal appearances during the trial, was in Hyderabad today.

 The court has so far examined six witnesses. Iqbal is the first witness to state that he had seen Khan emerge from the Land Cruiser that crashed into the American Bakery on Bandras Hill Road in the wee hours of September 29. The victims one dead and four injured were employees of an adjoining bakery.

 Last month, Mohammed Niyat Shaikh, who was sleeping along with Iqbal, had turned hostile after he disowned a statement attributed to him by police that he had seen the actor driving the vehicle.

 In June, Mohammed Abdul Rauf Shaikh, another witness injured in the accident, had told the court that he was trapped under the vehicle and did not see whether Salman was the driver.

 Khans lawyer Dipesh Mehta, however, played down the significance of the witnesss statement today. One cannot comment on any depositions in the trial until the cross-examination by defence is complete, he told The Telegraph. 

 The prosecution completed Iqbals examination that began yesterday. Mehta will cross-examine Iqbal on January 17.

 The prosecution is planning to examine as many as 60 witnesses Iqbal was the sixth to be heard today.

 The prosecution has already called police constable Ravindra Patil, who was in Salmans Land Cruiser at the time of the accident, a paan shop owner Ramasray Pandey, who was sleeping in an adjacent shop, and Shaikh Ibrahim, cousin of the deceased Narulla Shaikh. All three had said they had not seen Salman driving the vehicle.

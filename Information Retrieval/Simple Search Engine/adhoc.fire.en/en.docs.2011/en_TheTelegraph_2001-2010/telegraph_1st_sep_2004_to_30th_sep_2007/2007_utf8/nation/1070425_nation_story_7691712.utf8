 Siblings squabble over painting 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 24: The fight is over a Jehangir Sabavala but a 50-year-old woman has run to the cops against her brother for pinching it.

 Mehar Devis has accused 57-year-old Rustom Mehta of allegedly stealing the painting valued at Rs 60-80 lakh from their upmarket Kemps Corner home in south Mumbai.

 In a complaint filed with Gamdevi police, Mehar claimed Rustom removed it from the hall of their 2000-sq-ft apartment on March 2 and left a note saying he had taken it as his mother had left it to him in her 1992 will.

 Tehami Mehta had, however, not named the painting she was leaving to Rustom. She had only said the painting kept against the side wall in the apartment would be his after her death.

 The painting had not come between the siblings she is an acupuncturist whose husband and kids stay in Europe and he is a bachelor businessman so far as it had been lying in the verandah, Mehar claimed.

 Recently, she put it up in the hall, in the same spot where the sketch their mother had left to Rustom was taken off. Mehar claimed she had given that to her brother soon after her mothers death in 1993.

 When he saw the Jehangir Sabavala displayed on the wall, Rustom unilaterally removed it, saying this was actually the one their mother intended for him, she claimed.

 Rustom then deposited it at a friends place in south Mumbai and left for Bangkok on work. He travels abroad frequently, the police said.

 The painting is now in police custody. Rustom voluntarily handed it over after he was arrested at Sahar airport on his way back from Bangkok.

 Inspector Shyam Parulekar, who is handling the case, said the police had tried to contact him after Mehar filed the complaint.

 Since we couldnt, we intimated the immigration department at Sahar airport. They informed us about his arrival early on Saturday and we arrested him, he said.

 He was granted bail by a court that said the painting should remain in police custody till the ownership issue was resolved.

 Rustoms lawyer Satish Maneshinde said the matter was not grave enough for the police to issue a lookout notice. Besides, Rustom had assured them he would hand over the painting on his return.

 The ownership of the painting cannot be decided by the police as the will has not been probated yet. Also, my client has not signed any agreement regarding the painting, he said.

 Mehar had no ownership documents either, he said.

 The truth shall come out. This is a family affair and I dont want to speak to the media about it, was all Mehar said.

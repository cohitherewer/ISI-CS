 Prisoners freed from crowded Tihar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 18: Six hundred inmates of Tihar jail have reason to thank the heat that has been singeing the capital it has brought them freedom.

 Delhi High Court today ordered the Tihar authorities to release prisoners charged with disturbing public peace considered a relatively minor offence to reduce overcrowding in the prison.

 Six inmates died in a week at Tihar recently, bringing allegations of ill-maintenance on the jail.

 Although the jail authorities initially denied that the deaths were related to heat, doctors at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hospital where the bodies are being examined have blamed heat stroke.

 Irrespective of the cause of death, it is clear that Tihar is extremely overcrowded. It is worth considering that in the future, all cases under Section 107 (security for keeping the peace) read with 151 (arrest to prevent commission of cognisable offence) of the Criminal Procedure Code be bailable at the police station itself, Justices Pradeep Nandarajog and P.K. Bhasin said. 

 At present, all those arrested for disturbing peace have to seek bail from a court.

 A three-member committee appointed by the court to investigate conditions of inmates at Tihar following the recent deaths described the situation as abominable.

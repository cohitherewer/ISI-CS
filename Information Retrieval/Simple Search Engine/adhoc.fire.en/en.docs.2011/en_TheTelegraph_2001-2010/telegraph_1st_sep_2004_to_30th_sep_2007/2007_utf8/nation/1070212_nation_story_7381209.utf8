 Sticks out for V-Day

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Muscle-flexing 

 Bhopal, Feb. 11: Its meant to be a festival of love, but the preparations couldnt have been more warlike.

 Sticks are being polished and swords have come out of their sheaths as Valentines Day nears in BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh.

 Even axes have been kept ready in case it comes to a showdown between those against celebrating a western concept and their rivals who wouldnt brook any interference in personal freedoms.

 The Bajrang Dal and the Shiv Sena are determined to stop what he called the attack on Indian culture.

 Vishal Purohit, who heads the Dals Bhopal unit, said: We have prepared our sticks by worshipping them to use against people who promote western culture. Purohit said he and his men will visit hotels and restaurants and stop celebrations on February 14. State Sena chief Rajendra Gupta said his men will do whatever possible to stop the celebrations.

 On the other side of the divide, the Swaran Mahila Morcha, an outfit that claims to represent upper castes, said its women would use sword, gada (mace) and battleaxe to take on the Dal. Another group, the Rashtriya Secular Manch, said it would field stick-wielding women to provide security to citizens which the Shivraj Singh Chauhan regime has failed to provide.

 If the Bajrang Dal uses force, we will match them, said Monu Saxena, state general secretary of the Congresss National Student Union of India.

 State police chief Anand Rao Pawar has asked district police chiefs to ensure that nobody interferes with the personal freedom of anyone.

 In the last three years that the BJP has been in power in Madhya Pradesh, the day has seen violent clashes. Even brothers and sisters were made to do sit-ups for travelling together.

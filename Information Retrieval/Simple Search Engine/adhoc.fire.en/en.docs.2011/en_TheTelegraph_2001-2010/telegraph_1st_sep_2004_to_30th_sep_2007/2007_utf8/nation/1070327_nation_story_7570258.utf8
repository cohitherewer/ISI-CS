 3 more nailed for 1984 riots

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 26: A Delhi trial court today convicted three men for murdering three members of a family, including a Delhi police constable, during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.

 The judgment takes the number of people convicted in the case to 14. 

 A day after Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards, a mob allegedly spurred on by Congress leader H.K.L. Bhagat had attacked Sikh families in the east Delhi locality of Shahadra. 

 Harparsad Bhardwaj, R.P. Tiwari and Jagdish Giri were today held guilty by additional sessions judge Rajender Kumar Shastri for leading the mob. They first killed head constable Niranjan Singh, on duty at the Shahadra railway station, and then turned on his 17-year old son Gurpal and son-in-law Mahender Singh.

 The next day, November 2, the three are accused of having led another mob to the slum localities of Shahadra, where Sikh families were again targeted. 

 Todays judgment is a big victory. It should be seen as a message for those who join mobs at the behest of politicians, that no one can keep them from the arms of law forever, said Supreme Court advocate Harvinder Singh Phoolka, who has been waging a solitary battle for justice for the 1984 victims.

 The sentence for the convicted will be pronounced on Wednesday.

 The judge, however, acquitted two other accused Suraj Giri and Kamlesh, a woman who, the prosecution claimed, had directed the mob to Niranjans house.

 Bhagat, a former Union minister, was the sixth accused in the case, but was later let off on grounds of being mentally unstable.

 Niranjans widow, Harminder Kaur, also the complainant in the case, now lives with her extended family in Punjab.

 Sex abuse charge on DU teacher

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 27: A Mexican student at Delhi University has alleged that her PhD guide sexually harassed her, forcing her to complain to her countrys embassy here before eventually leaving India. 

 DU has issued a showcause notice to Professor D. Sahoo. 

 According to the girls complaint, Sahoo, a reader at the biochemistry department, had made several lewd remarks at the student, department head Ashok Bhatnagar told The Telegraph. 

 Sahoo has denied the charges, but I have asked him to give his explanation in detail, Bhatnagar said. 

 On one occasion, the girl has alleged, a drunk Sahoo turned up unannounced at her rented south Delhi flat. 

 The girl, Bhatnagar said, had complained to the Mexican embassy, which contacted him. They told me the girl wanted to leave the university and go back home. 

 The girl was yesterday handed her no-dues certificate which means she is officially not a student of DU anymore. 

 The university had last week dismissed two professors accused of sexual harassment, after an enquiry committee found them guilty.

 Rahul faces twin charges

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 6: A Delhi court today framed charges against Rahul Mahajan in the drug abuse case, under which he could face a sentence of up to 10 years if convicted. 

 Additional sessions judge S.N. Gupta said the trial would start on March 10. 

 Rahul (in picture), son of the late BJP leader Pramod Mahajan, fell ill after he allegedly consumed a potentially lethal combination of heroin and cocaine during a party at the Mahajans Safdarjung Road residence in June last year. Pramods secretary Bibek Moitra died apparently from a drug overdose. 

 Rahul was today charged with allowing premises to be used for the commission of an offence (Section 25) and criminal conspiracy and abetment (Section 29) under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. 

 The maximum sentence he could face if convicted under Section 25 is 10 years. Under Section 29, the punishment could be up to five years, but is generally handed out concurrent to the bigger sentence. 

 Co-accused Sahil Zaroo faces charges under Section 21 of the same act purchase and sale of drugs which also carries a maximum sentence of 10 years. 

 He has also been charged under Section 29, apart from Section 419 (cheating by impersonation) of the Indian Penal Code, which carries a maximum sentence of three years. Police believe Sahil had bought the narcotics before handing them over to Rahul and Bibek. 

 Nigerians Ashola Md Abdullah and Egbedokun James Taiwo, who allegedly sold the drugs to Sahil, have been charged under Sections 21 and 29. 

 Pramods close aide Harish Sharma and the Mahajan family servant, Ganesh Sinha, have been charged with destroying evidence against Rahul (Section 201) and criminal conspiracy (Section 320 [b]) both fall under the IPC.

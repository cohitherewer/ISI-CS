 Mamata decides to stay out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 18: Mamata Banerjee has finally spoken her party will stay away from tomorrows presidential poll because A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has been denied a second term.

 The Trinamul Congress leader, who had already made clear she was not with the BJP-led NDA for the presidential poll, met party MPs and MLAs at her Kalighat residence today.

 It was decided unanimously at todays meeting that the Trinamul Congress would not participate in the presidential election. Our decision is in protest against the UPA governments refusal to allow Kalam a second term, she said after the meeting.

 The decision is unlikely to impede UPA-Left nominee Pratibha Patils march to Rashtrapati Bhavan as the Congress-led combine and its allies command more than half the votes in an electoral college of 10.98 lakh.

 Trinamul accounts for 7,211 votes. Its 29 MLAs excluding the suspended Sadhan Pande who has said he would vote for the UPA nominee have, like other Bengal MLAs, a vote value of 151 each. The four party MPs, including Mamata, have 2,832 votes, 708 being the value of each of the 770-odd parliamentarians.

 By deciding to abstain, Mamata has followed in the footsteps of the United National Progressive Alliance or the third front led by former chief ministers N. Chandrababu Naidu and Jayalalithaa.

 Mamata had, in fact, paid a visit to Jayalalithaa in Chennai and is learnt to have talked about the need to have Kalam as President for another term.

 We took out processions to demand that Kalam should continue as the countrys President. But the ruling party didnt listen and selected a candidate who doesnt fit the bill. The choice of the UPA presidential nominee reflects political bankruptcy, the Trinamul leader said.

 Asked about the NDAs move to nominate Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, Mamata said the Vice-President showed rare magnanimity by offering to step down if Kalam was in the race. Thats why we took the decision to back the present President, she added.

 Mamata evaded a reply when asked what message she was trying to convey to the BJP by not supporting its candidate. 

 Todays meeting was to discuss what would be our stand on the presidential election. Our MPs and MLAs attended the meeting and took the decision not to participate. So this question cant be answered now, she said.

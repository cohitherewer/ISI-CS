 Nuke chief voices deal fears

 - Maintain research tempo: Kakodkar

 Chidambaram, Jan. 4: The chairman of Indias Atomic Energy Commission today said the nuke deal with the US should be concluded in a way that does not stifle indigenous research and development programmes.

 Anil Kakodkar also announced that India would begin constructing its first advanced heavy water reactor using thorium as fuel sometime in 2007, marking the launch of the third stage of the nuclear programme.

 Kakodkar said the tempo of Indias nuclear power programme has to be maintained, as we will always be short by 20 per cent of our energy requirements. This should go on without any external safeguard hindrances, he added, during a session on energy security at the 94th Indian Science Congress being hosted by Annamalai University.Later, replying to a query, the nuclear scientist who is also secretary in the department of atomic energy, said there were concerns about the nuclear deal coming in the way of Indias domestic power programme.

 But Kakokdar stressed that the domestic programme was independent and would go on. We have to negotiate and make sure that it (the Indo-US deal) does not impinge on our research and development efforts.

 He said work on the 300-MW heavy water reactor was at an advanced stage and design and pre-licensing safety clearances from the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board are awaited. The reactor would be a technology demonstrator, using thorium as fuel that can be recycled.

 The scientist said the third-stage reactors design had several unique features, including one that would prevent it from heating up beyond a safe limit. It has also been designed to last a hundred years.

 With several units under construction, including a 500-MW prototype fast breeder reactor at Kalpakkam and two light water reactors being built with Russian assistance in Koodangalam in Tamil Nadu, the countrys nuclear power capacity should cross the 20,000-MW mark by 2020, Kakodkar said.

 He disclosed that the department of atomic energy would launch a massive exploration activity to find richer uranium ore that could help generate 15 times more electricity than the low-content ore now used in pressurised heavy water reactors.

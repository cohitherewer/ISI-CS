 Archana on her wedding day 

 Patna, Aug. 16: The daughter of a fast-track court judge went missing from a moving train, somewhere between Katihar and Mokama, on Tuesday night. 

 Rani Archana Singh, a law graduate and daughter of Banka additional district and sessions judge Subhash Chandra Prasad, was returning to Patna from New Jalpaiguri on the Capital Express with her husband Rajiv Singh. 

 The judge suspects it to be a case of kidnapping, given the states crime record.

 Archanas husband Rajiv, who registered a case with Mokama GRP, said: We boarded the train at New Jalpaiguri on August 14 and reached Katihar around 8.30pm. We went to sleep at 8.40pm. When I woke up at 5.10am on August 15, the train was near Bakhtiyarpur. I found her missing. Her slippers and purse were all there. 

 Rajiv, a railway engineer working in Jodhpur, was travelling with his new bride in the sleeper compartment. 

 They got married on April 29.

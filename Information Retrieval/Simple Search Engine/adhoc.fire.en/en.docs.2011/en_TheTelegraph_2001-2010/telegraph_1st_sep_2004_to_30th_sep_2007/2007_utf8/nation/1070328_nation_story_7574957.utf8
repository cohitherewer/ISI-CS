 Mumbai, March 27 (AP): Throw Indian and American soldiers into a barren Afghanistan desert, toss a nuclear warhead into the hands of terrorists and you have an action-packed plot in the latest graphic novel to be released by Virgin Comics.

 Created by graphic artists in Bangalore, the dark tale titled Virulents is the latest in a series of comic books produced in a year-old partnership between British billionaire Richard Branson, spiritual guru Deepak Chopra and filmmaker Shekhar Kapur.

 The comic will first be released in the US tomorrow, followed by Britain and India.

 Graphic novels are part of Virgins strategy to tap Indias booming entertainment market. The company sees India, with its 1-billion-plus population, both as a producer of content and as a consumer.

 Its one of the biggest entertainment markets with 55 per cent of the population 550 million people under the age of 20, Suresh Seetharaman, president of Virgin Comics, said in Mumbai.

 Virtually all the art is created here. We have a team of 120 in Bangalore, he said.

 An American reading it has no idea it was not written down the road from where he lives, added Larry Lieberman, the chief marketing officer of Virgin Comics. He has no idea it is written, conceived and illustrated in India, in Bangalore.

 Seetharaman said Branson viewed the partnership as a means to feature eastern stories and philosophies of destiny.

 India is strong in mythology and magic. It has a vault of stories that we can tap, package and present to the world, he said on the sidelines of a global entertainment industry conference.

 Unlike last years serialised Virgin comics such as The Sadhu, Devi and Snakewoman, which are science fiction takeoffs on epic Indian good-versus-evil tales, the new release tells the whole story in one book and at first glance appears rooted in the present.

 The troops liberally swear in English and Hindi, and there are references to the war on terror, US President George W. Bush and even Bollywood beauty Aishwarya Rai.

 Then comes the twist the terrorists turn into demonic vampires.

 The new novel draws inspiration from an ancient Indian legend of a blood demon who spawns clones every time a warrior slashes and spills his blood.

 A recent study by PricewaterhouseCoopers, released earlier at a Mumbai conference, projects Indias media and entertainment business to more than double over the next five years to hit Rs 1 trillion in sales by 2011. Sales touched nearly Rs 437 billion in 2006, up 20 per cent from a year ago.

 Virgin Comics covers a broad swathe of genres, from horror, fantasy to super heroic adventures, and the creators have planned the next logical step the movies.

 In December, the company announced that Hollywood star Nicholas Cage would play a spiritual warrior hunting a man who murdered his family in a film hatched from its comic book The Sadhu.

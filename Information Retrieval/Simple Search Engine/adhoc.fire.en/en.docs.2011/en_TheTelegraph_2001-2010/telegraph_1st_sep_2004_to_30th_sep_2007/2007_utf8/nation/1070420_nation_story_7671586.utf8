 Narayanan gets a deputy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 19: Leela K. Poonappa was today appointed deputy national security adviser in the Prime Ministers Office.

 A 1970-batch foreign service officer, Poonappa had recently retired. Her last posting was as Indias ambassador to The Hague.

 The cabinet committee on appointments, which is chaired by the Prime Minister, cleared her appointment. Official sources said it will be formally announced later.

 Poonappa is expected to assist national security adviser M.K. Narayanan. Sources maintained she will be expected to provide foreign policy inputs to the PMO. 

 At present, Narayanan looks after China, but the PMO is reportedly concerned about the political developments in Indias neighbourhood, particularly in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

 It was earlier speculated that Poonappa and Indias former ambassador to France, Dilip Lahiri, were in the running for the deputy national security advisers post.

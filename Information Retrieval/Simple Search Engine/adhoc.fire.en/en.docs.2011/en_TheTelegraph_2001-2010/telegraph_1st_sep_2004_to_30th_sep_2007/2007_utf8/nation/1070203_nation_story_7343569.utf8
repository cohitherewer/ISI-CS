 Manu in SC with media complaint

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: Manu Sharma, who has been sentenced to life in the Jessica Lal murder case, today told the Supreme Court that the media had browbeaten the high court judges and his counsel through a malicious and vicious campaign to ensure his conviction. 

 Manu, currently lodged in Tihar Jail, made the allegation in a petition seeking bail till the apex court takes a decision on his appeal against the December 2006 Delhi High Court judgment.

 A trial court had acquitted all nine accused in the case in February 2006 but the high court found Manu and two others guilty. Manu, the son of former minister Venod Sharma, is accused of shooting Jessica at Tamarind Court, a restaurant owned by socialite Bina Ramani. 

 The petition said Manu has always abided by the terms and conditions of bail and had surrendered on the same day as his conviction. 

 The high court verdict was replete with grave errors, Manu said in his appeal, adding that he did not get a fair hearing because of media pressure. The appeal argued that the high court had ignored many relevant witnesses and focused on Ramani although she never claimed to have seen him shoot Jessica.

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Word puzzle in blast trail

 To some in Hyderabad, words like shaadi, paan, ghaas, dawa and phool-dane dont mean what they do elsewhere.

 The city, never drab when it comes to the local lingo, has woken up to a less ordinary side of these everyday Hindi words.

 Investigations into last months Mecca Masjid blasts have revealed that the words were codes used by plotters. Police stumbled on these terms in Internet chats and emails and sought the help of IT experts to piece together the jigsaw the sequence of events and commands.

 ample this: Phool-dane toot gaye (flower pots have broken). This was part of an email sent by a blast suspect.

 Shaadi meant the team (planting the bombs), while ghaas was a code for explosives; paan mandi was supposed to signify a storehouse for explosives and other equipment. Dawa (medicines) was another word for blasts. Seniors, controllers and agents were chachas or mamus. 

 A police official said the words and meanings might have already changed since codes are changed frequently. But at least we know what they are up to, he said.

 Beauty tips from varsity

 The look-good industry has just got a launchpad down south. 

 A university in Madurai is poised to begin a beauticians course that will be open to both women and men. The move to offer such a course could be a first in the country.

 Those keen on the Madurai -Kamraj University programme, beginning next month, must have passed their Class X board exams. For women, a three-month beauticians course is planned. For men, there will be a month crash course on beautician and aroma therapy. 

 University authorities said the high demand for beauticians from the film industry and tourism and travel companies prompted them to start the courses.

 The two industries are among the areas where image makeovers matter and the prospects of self-employment are bright. 

 Ride ends in Rs 18-lakh hit

 An accident claims tribunal has fined a Delhi businessman driving a scooter, when he had the licence only to be behind the wheel of a car, a hefty sum of Rs 18 lakh. 

 Sanjay Panchal will have to pay the amount to National Insurance Company, which had to cover the medical expenses of a man whom he hit while driving the two-wheeler. 

 Anshu Gupta, the man Panchal hit, suffered 70 per cent disabilities following the accident. The accused was driving with a licence that was invalid for the vehicle he was in. The insurance companys argument that it is entitled to recover the amount seems reasonable, said A.S. Jayachandra, the presiding officer of the tribunal. What appears to have piqued the officer more is Panchals attitude after the accident.

 The businessman, according to police, tried to bribe them with a fat wad of notes.

 Cheap amp; BEST

 Life for the hop-and-skip Mumbai commuter promises to get simpler, at least in buses.

 Last week, BEST approved a new fare slab of Rs 3 for distances up to 2km. The minimum fare is Rs 4 now, up to 3km.

 The new slab, which effectively brings down the minimum ticket price to Rs 3, has come with concessions for visually handicapped commuters. They will have to pay only Re 1, down from Rs 2 at present.

 The fare revision was proposed in the BEST annual budget a few months ago. The new ticket prices will come into force once the fares are approved by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. BEST runs 4,000 buses every day.

 Mumbai: Chetan Anand Politics of Film, a 90-minute documentary directed by the filmmakers eldest son Ketan Anand, will be shown at Ketnav Recording Theatre, Khar (West), on July 5 at 6pm to commemorate Anands 10th death anniversary, which is on July 7.

 Diggers in sanctuary

 Pithoragarh, July 11 (PTI): A Reliance Energy team found digging without permission inside the Askot wildlife sanctuary was sent back last month, a forest official said.

 The incident occurred on June 23, said Himalaya Singh Tolia, the forest range officer of Dharchula.

 In 2005, Reliance Energy had signed an agreement with the Uttarakhand government for a 280mw hydro-electric project on the Dhauli Ganga river in Pithoragarh district, bordered by Tibet and Nepal. 

 The three-member team was digging at the proposed project site to take samples as part of a preliminary survey.

 No-trust hush in BJP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 19: The BJP today avoided saying if it might move a no-confidence motion against the Manmohan Singh government, but sources suggested that most party leaders would rather let the Left lead the attack.

 They added that the party leadership wanted to see whether the Left would indeed withdraw support or expose itself by crying off at the last minute. 

 We stand to gain little by causing a diversion at this point, an MP said.

 BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who briefed the media after a core-group meeting at former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees residence, was asked about the possibility of a no-confidence motion.

 These are parliamentary strategies to be decided in consultation with NDA leaders. We cant say anything at this moment, the party vice-president said.

 He added that NDA leaders would meet at leader of the Opposition L.K. Advanis residence tomorrow morning.

 Former minister Yashwant Sinha, too, dodged questions on a no-trust motion, arguing the government should resign on its own if the Left withdraws support.

 Many in the party believe that the Left will not support a BJP-sponsored no-confidence motion, and so there is no point jumping into the ring. 

 For now, the BJP will keep up the pressure on the government and try to convince the people that the quarrelling UPA and Left had put the nations growth on hold.

 But Naqvi would not accept that the BJP was willing to play second fiddle to the Left despite being the main Opposition party.

 We are not in the wait-and-watch mode. We are discussing the issues and going to play an active role. In fact, the meeting discussed the possibility of a mid-term poll and expressed concern at the paralysis in governance.

 Naqvi added that the BJP was prepared for an election. 

 He, however, denied that the BJP was taking a tough posture only to provoke the Left. The crisis was of the governments own making, he said, since it had ignored national interest.

 The Left itself has said the deal is a threat to national sovereignty, so it is their duty to agitate without any provocation (from the BJP).

 Yashwant said this was the best time to disengage from the deal. Pulling out would not affect Indias image because the deal is far from done, he argued.

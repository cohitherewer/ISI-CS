 Judeo sting case

 New Delhi, April 25 (PTI): A court today framed charges against BJP leader Dilip Singh Judeo in the cash-on-camera case.

 The court also framed charges against Judeos then private secretary Natwar Rateria, who was caught on camera when the former Union minister was allegedly receiving cash, and four others, including former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogis son Amit. 

 Amit had reportedly orchestrated a sting operation to disgrace the former Union minister.

 Bhupender Singh Patel, Arvind Vijay Mohan and Rajat Prasad, who played a key role in carrying out the sting operation, are the other three charged under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act.

 There is, prima facie, sufficient material on record to frame charges against the accused persons, special CBI judge I.K. Kochhar said.

 The CBI has alleged that Judeo, who was forest and environment minister in the NDA government, and Rateria had received bribes worth Rs 9 lakh at Hotel Taj Mansingh Palace in Delhi on November 5, 2003.

 The money was offered by Patel during the sting operation as Amit wanted to disgrace Judeo ahead of the Assembly elections in Chhattisgarh in November 2003, the chargesheet alleged.

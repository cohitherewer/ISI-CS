 Biman rules out pullout

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 16: Bengal CPM secretary Biman Bose today said toppling the UPA government was not on the partys agenda. 

 Bose (in picture) and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee left for Delhi this evening to attend a crucial politburo meeting from tomorrow. 

 CPM general secretary Prakash Karat had earlier spoken of the political consequences of overruling the Lefts opposition to the nuclear deal.

 The two-day politburo session is to finalise the partys strategy for the debate on the Indo-US deal in Parliament. The meeting will also discuss how to be aggressive with the government without brinkmanship. 

 Bhattacharjee, who has a dinner invite from Manmohan Singh, will visit the Prime Ministers residence at 8pm tomorrow after the first day of the politburo meeting.

 We do not have any agenda to bring down the government. But we want it to change policies, Bose said.He dismissed talk of mid-term polls as gossip, saying: I dont think it has any basis. 

 Although he hinted that the Bengal CPM would not like to burn bridges with a friendly Congress-led government, Bose criticised Singh for trying to teach the Left coalition dharma.

 The Prime Minister wanted us to learn about coalition politics. But it is better he should learn it from us since he is running a minority government.

 CPM patriarch Jyoti Basu, who skips politburo meetings these days because of his advanced age, had earlier made clear that the party would stage a walkout if the BJP-led NDA insisted on voting on the deal after the debate in Parliament.

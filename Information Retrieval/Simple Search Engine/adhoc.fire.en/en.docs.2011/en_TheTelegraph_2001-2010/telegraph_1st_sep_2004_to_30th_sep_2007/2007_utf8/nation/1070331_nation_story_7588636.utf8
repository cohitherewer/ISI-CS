 Exporters land in pulses mess

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 30: The CBI today registered cases against three Delhi-based exporters for selling pulses abroad despite a ban.

 The agency said investigations are also on to establish whether gangster Dawood Ibrahims entities are involved in the racket.

 The cases have been registered against Jet King International, Kohinoor Foods Ltd and KRBL Ltd. The owners of these firms and the Dubai-based buyers to whom the consignments were shipped have been charged.

 These firms exported about 60,000 tonnes of pulses, valued at $58 million (around Rs 250 crore) during the ban, said a CBI official. 

 A raid on their offices had yielded computer hard disks containing the agreement with buyers, invoices, letters of credit and letters exchanged with government agencies, the official claimed.

 Investigations will reveal if the firms and their Dubai buyers have links with the Dawood gang, a source said. 

 The allegation of illegal export of pulses was raised earlier this month by the BJP, which sought the Prime Ministers intervention and a criminal investigation. 

 The party wants the Centre to find out how such exports were allowed despite a ban from June 22 last year to March 31.

 The owners of the three companies Shyam Jain, Satnam Arora and A.C. Mittal were alleged to have connived with the overseas buyers to get around the ban by manipulating letters of credit with a bank on Cook Islands.

 Shyam Jain is the brother of Naresh Chandra Jain, who was arrested along with six other Indians by Dubai police last month on charges of money laundering. The racket was busted on a US tip-off.

 The representatives of the exporters could not be contacted for comment.

 Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi 

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today promised Rahul Gandhi that a decision on his request to extend the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme to the entire country would be taken soon.

 Getting the UPAs flagship scheme, now run in 330 districts, to more areas is part of the new Congress general secretarys plan to push the aam aadmi agenda.

 Rahul made the request when he went to wish the Prime Minister on his birthday. The reciprocation was almost immediate: Singh said the suggestion to extend the scheme would be passed on to the rural development ministry, which oversees the employment programme. 

 Rahul was accompanied by 10 other general secretaries, including Veerappa Moily, Margaret Alva, Prithviraj Chavan, Kishore Chandra Deo and Janardhan Dwivedi.

 A release issued by the Prime Ministers Office later said the demand for extension was proof of the schemes popularity. The act (scheme) has provided relief to those in distress and made a significant difference to the lives of the rural poor who have used it to secure relief wherever they had no other source of livelihood. The act itself has an in-built commitment to cover the entire country.

 Rahul and his colleagues told Singh the extension would reinforce the governments commitment to eradicate poverty and be welcomed as a key welfare measure, the release said.

 A member of the delegation pointed out the alleged abuses in the way the scheme was being implemented in Opposition-ruled states like Madhya Pradesh and Orissa.

 The delegation claimed funds were being put to other uses, the minimum wage was not being paid and some states, especially those ruled by the BJP, were trying to take credit for the scheme.

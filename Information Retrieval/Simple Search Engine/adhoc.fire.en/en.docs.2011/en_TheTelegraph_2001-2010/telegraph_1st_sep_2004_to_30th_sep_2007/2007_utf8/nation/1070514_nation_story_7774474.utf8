 Muslims put Mayavati before clergy

 Lucknow, May 13: The clerics had backed Mulayam Singh Yadav but the Muslim voter went out and voted for Mayavati. Both are still rubbing their eyes in disbelief.

 The BJP has been drubbed and the Muslim strength in the Assembly is up from 46 to an all-time high of 56, with the bulk of them from the Bahujan Samaj Party (29). The Samajwadi Party has 21, Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal has three, and three are Independents.

 What is heartening for management professional Kamran Moid is the ease with which Mayavati dealt a body blow to the communal forces.

 There was no clarion call, no communal flare-up, no focusing of the spotlight on Muslim issues. Yet so many Muslim nominees won and the BJP has been driven out, Moid said.

 The clergy is less enthusiastic. Most religious bodies and the leaders of the Nadwa, Deoband, Barelvi and Shia sects had issued appeals of support for the Samajwadi Party or the Congress.

 The Muslim voters also rejected Muslim parties like Haji Yaqoob Qureshis Uttar Pradesh United Democratic Front, which tried to repeat the Assam experiment of Muslim organisations forming a political outfit and claiming to speak for the community.

 In a secular democracy, we dont need tutoring from maulvis and imams, said Saif Hashmi, a final-year engineering student in Lucknow.

 The poll results are a clear message to the clergy to stay away from politics. Else, the Muslim awam (masses) will move away in the other (social and religious) spheres, too, said Maulana Khalid Rasheed Firangimahli, who at 32 is the youngest member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board.

 Several organisations like the radical Jamat-e-Islami had taken an interest in the poll. In Delhi, representatives of the Jamat, Milli Council and the Jamiat-e-Ulema had gathered with law board members to guide the Muslim voter.

 The Congresss Ahmad Patel, too, had held several closed-door meetings with the Muslim clergy. From the fourth phase onwards, many leading Shia and Sunni clerics had issued public appeals on the Samajwadis behalf.

 Most Urdu newspapers and magazines were packed with insertions from the Samajwadis and the Congress that attacked each other.

 The BSP didnt put out a single advertisement in the Urdu press, which constantly reminded voters about Mayavatis opportunist past and her tendency to join hands with the BJP.

 The BSPs campaign hardly touched the emotive issues of the Muslims minority status, reservations, Babri Masjid or the Aligarh Muslim University.

 Zafaryab Jeelani, a hardline Muslim leader, said he was happy to see Mayavati as chief minister. She has a tendency to enforce the rule of law without weighing the pros and cons, he said.

 Jeelani said Mulayam dilly-dallied over the fresh notification for the Babri trial in the Rae Bareli court. He didnt act on the law boards appeals for amendments to the UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, which would have given Muslim women rights over their families agricultural income.

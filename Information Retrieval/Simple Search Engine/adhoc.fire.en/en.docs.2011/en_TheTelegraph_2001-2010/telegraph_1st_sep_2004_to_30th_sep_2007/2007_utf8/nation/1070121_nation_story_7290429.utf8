 DD cricket deal no-balled

 Caught in a logjam

 New Delhi, Jan. 20: Cricket lovers banking on Doordarshan could wake up to a disappointing Sunday when Rahul Dravids boys take on Brian Lara and his Calypso band.

 Public broadcaster Prasar Bharati and rights holder Nimbus have failed to strike a deal on sharing the live telecast of the four-match India-West Indies one-day series, which begins tomorrow and ends on January 31.

 Nimbus Communications had paid $ 612 million last year to the cricket board for exclusive broadcast rights to all BCCI-organised matches played in the country till March 2010.

 The governments downlink and uplink guidelines, however, say private channels must share live feed of all matches of national interest with Doordarshan. But Nimbus is not agreeing at least not on the terms set by Prasar Bharati, which manages Doordarshan and All India Radio.

 Till this evening, after two days of parleys, no breakthrough was in sight, but sources still held out the possibility of further negotiations.

 Harish Thawani, who heads the Mumbai-based sports marketing company, argued that uplink guidelines were not binding and said Nimbus would go to court if coerced.

 He stressed that his company was not against sharing the feed, but the national channel should broadcast the shared signal only on its terrestrial service the television that viewers get to see through rooftop antennas. Thawani said if the live signal was broadcast through DDs direct-to-home service DD Direct Plus or through its satellite channels, Nimbus would lose money.

 The company wanted Doordarshan to encrypt the signal so that only its terrestrial channels would get to beam it. If there was a technical problem in encrypting the signal for the first match, Nimbus was still willing to share. But DD, he said, must then accept a deferred feed: instead of a live signal, Nimbus would send the feed after a 15-minute gap. Doordarshan could then slug it As Live instead of Live, Nimbus suggested.

 But Prasar Bharati said it is unacceptable. 

 If the standoff persists, only Nimbuss own channel, Neo Sports, will broadcast tomorrows match live in India. Neo Sports could also be carried on Tata-Sky, a DTH platform. Thawani indicated that talks were on between the two.

 Prasar Bharati has asked Nimbus to allow AIR to broadcast a commentary of the match, at least. But it says Nimbus is not agreeing on a radio agreement unless there is a television agreement first.

 No breakthrough, according to Prasar Bharati, means 55 million homes that get DDs terrestrial, DTH and cable service will miss the action.

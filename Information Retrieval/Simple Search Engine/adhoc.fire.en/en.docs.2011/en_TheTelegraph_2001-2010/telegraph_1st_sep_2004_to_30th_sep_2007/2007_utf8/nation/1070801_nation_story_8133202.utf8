The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Wastrel to hero to victim-villain

 SUJAN DUTTA

 On a languid afternoon in the early 1980s, in Mumbais Elphinstone College, a group of over-aged students were recalling Sanjay Dutt. He used to be among the junkies who smoked pot in the colonial buildings darker recesses. The occasion was not his presence, but his absence. 

 Sanjay Dutt was beginning to emerge as a celebrity. His first film Rocky had just released. The gangly Sanjay was making a new fashion statement in denim jumpsuits, the single-piece jeans that were not only pants but also covered the chest.

 When he was sentenced to jail today, a fan of his remarked that Sanjay was not in his lucky blue shirt, the garment he has worn over his jeans for most of his court appearances. Suketu Mehta, author of Maximum City, probably the best-known profile of Mumbai, has a different take. 

 In his book, he treats the character of Sanjay as an overgrown schoolboy, who is built like a brontosaurus, is fascinated with dons, plays with guns and pumps iron. All of this because he was probably bullied in class and he identified with one set of toughies to get back at his bullies.

 It is the life that Sanjay has packed into his sojourn from junkie to jailbird that makes his personality so large. He was a wastrel who went on to portray heroes. Hes a star who not only portrayed but on the evidence presented in court also became a criminal. 

 But not even the man who sent him to the cooler today has painted him as a villain.

 Act till the age of 100, Judge Pramod Kode commiserated with Sanjay after the sentencing this afternoon. I have only taken away six years.

 Sanjay turned 48 on Sunday. 

 Kode said he enjoyed Sanjays acting. Sanjay told him that the judge had come to be looked upon as one of the family. I am very tired, sir. I just need your blessings, he pleaded with folded hands.

 In a trial that has probably been the most public of all criminal cases, Sanjay was unquestionably the star attraction. The sentencing of Sanjay will still be debated despite the possibility of reprieve after he appeals to the Supreme Court. The debate has two extremities:

 First Is it fair to punish a man who has admitted to his mistake, has served 18 months in jail, and is apparently reformed? If the objective of punishment is to reform the criminal, why sentence Sanjay who has turned over a new leaf? 

 Second if Sanjay is not punished for an established guilt, the scales of justice will not be balanced. The public perception that Sanjay has been let off because he is a celebrity and is influential enough to pull strings will be strengthened. Justice is not blind, it winks.

 Sanjay could have driven away from court today in a car with the sticker that reads Never Give In. Instead, he was taken by police to Arthur Road Jail.

 Sometime later this week, his lawyer is expected to file an appeal in the Supreme Court. Till such time, Sanjay will recall the words he said in a recent interview. I go to sleep peacefully. I live for the day and every day is a new tomorrow. Words, that have been said earlier by his betters. 

 Murali Prasad Sharma may have remarked otherwise. Bole toh..., go so many of the dialogues of the character essayed by Sanjay in the Munnabhai films. And Circuit would have listened intently kanoon ke saamne sab ek hain.

 The law is a great equaliser, for hero and criminal. And, at most, Sanjay will now get to portray the role of victim-as-villain.

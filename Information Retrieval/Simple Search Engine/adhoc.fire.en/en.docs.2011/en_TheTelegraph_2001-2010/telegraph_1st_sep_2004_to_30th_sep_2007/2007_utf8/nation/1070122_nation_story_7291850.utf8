 Gold in boot? SC says my foot!

 Golden bluff

 New Delhi, Jan. 21: This is one practice thats the sole prerogative of crooks, say Supreme Court judges, stunned by a tribunal that accepted hiding gold in shoes as trade tactics.

 Two well-heeled traders convinced a gullible tax tribunal in Ahmedabad that they didnt intend to dupe the exchequer when they were hiding gold bars in their shoe soles. It was, after all, a harmless way of avoiding risks.

 It just doesnt go down our throats when you say gold bars are kept in the soles of shoes as part of your trade. Only a smuggler would do such things, said Justice Markandeya Katju, one of the judges on a two-judge bench that heard the customss plea against an internal tribunal that has powers to hear and settle tax disputes. 

 The argument had helped the traders win an acquittal.

 But while the duo might have believed theyd made hiding things an art form, the judges didnt conceal their shock. Even a person with ordinary common sense would not accept such a proposition, the bench, on which Justice S.B. Sinha was the other judge, observed. 

 Out of the ordinary, is it? Certainly, theres nothing ordinary about the yellow metal, much less about people who take such pains to give their footwear a golden touch.

 Lawyers for Vijay Dasarth Patel and Shailesh Bhai Patel saw their arguments booted out when they tried persuading the judges that a tax swindle wasnt on the traders minds when they were caught on the wrong foot. 

 Only a crook will carry gold in shoe soles, the bench retorted.

 There was more to their business practice than putting shoes to clever use. The traders carried invoices (receipts) dated October 24, 1999 the day they were arrested to prove that their gold bars were legally imported, but claimed during the probe to have purchased the consignment a day before.

 The apex court judges wondered how the tribunal had overlooked such a difference in actual purchase and the date of the receipt was also passed off as a normal practice in gold trade. 

 The arguments in the case are over, but the bench has reserved its judgment. The sole-mates might well guess whats in store.

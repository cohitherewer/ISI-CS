 Chauhan: In trouble

 Bhopal, Aug. 25: Rivals have raised a stink over his wifes allegedly corrupt practices and his BJP MLAs are angry after a cabinet expansion. Shivraj Singh Chauhan has trouble on both fronts.

 In a letter to the Madhya Pradesh chief minister, predecessor Digvijay Singh of the Congress questioned Chauhans wifes reported purchase of several trucks that she then leased to a cement factory.

 Digvijay wanted to know if Sadhna was an income-tax payer. While I acknowledge that your wife has a right to earn a livelihood, I have a few questions, Digvijay wrote. 

 Why did she give her husbands name as S.R. Singh and an address in Rewa instead of the official chief ministers residence in Bhopal or the village Dobi in Sehore district? 

 Digvijay also wanted to know why Chauhan and his cabinet colleagues had not submitted their income-tax statements in the Assembly. 

 Uma Bharti, also a former Madhya Pradesh chief minister, said: I consider this a dummy regime. If the chief minister has no control over his wifes activities, how can he run the state? 

 Uma claimed the trucks were just the tip of an iceberg. 

 She is camping in Bhopal on a day two of her associates Gauri Shankar Shejwar and Karan Singh Verma joined the Chauhan cabinet. 

 Asked if the move was a setback to her, Uma said: Just wait and see if they contest the Assembly polls as BJP or Bharatiya Janshakti Party nominees. The polls are scheduled in November 2008.

 Chauhans much-awaited cabinet expansion disappointed many in the ruling BJP today. 

 Kapoor Chand Guwahara, a communist leader who had quit the CPM to win Umas Bada Malehra seat on a BJP ticket, was vocal. 

 Now I am free to say what I have to, Guwahara, who was promised a cabinet berth, said. 

 Apart from Guwahara, Archana Chitnis, Sudha Jain, Kailash Chawla and Uma Shankar Gupta said they were disappointed not to find a place in the cabinet.

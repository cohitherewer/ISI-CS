 Math phobia? Relax and try pottery

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 

 New Delhi, Aug. 20: The failure to solve mathematics problems correctly or recite poems by rote may no longer elicit embarrassing comments in report cards for primary school children. 

 The Centre will introduce a mechanism to evaluate students educational development which does not hinge on their performance in textbook-based tests and examinations. 

 Instead, students will be individually monitored by teachers to assess their affinity for a particular field from a young age.

 The move came after years of debate and several public promises. 

 So, a child who likes playing with clay will, instead of being reprimanded, be guided by the teachers to a pottery class. 

 Prepared under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan by over 70 experts, a draft of the book, Learning Assessment at the Primary level, will reach 160 schools across India 16 each in 10 states this September. 

 Based on the response from the schools, the draft will be modified and the final book, officials hope, will be available to all schools by April next year. 

 This mechanism of evaluating students will usher in a new era in Indian pedagogy, said K.K. Vashishtha, one of the key players who put together the manuscript of the book. Teachers will use the book to maintain a progress chart for each student, Vashishtha, the head of the National Council for Educational Research and Trainings (NCERT) department of elementary education, said. 

 Conventional subjects will continue to be taught. But a student poor in math wont be critically evaluated on the subject. Instead, his ability to learn will be assessed in what he can do well, Vashishtha said. 

 The concept of wholesome learning at a young age was accepted by the human resource development ministry under the National Curriculum Framework guidelines prepared in 2005. 

 Under the curriculum framework, the NCERT has been preparing a new series of textbooks that it hopes will address complaints of dwindling classroom attention pouring in from all corners of the country. 

 The revamped textbooks, though, invited an entirely new set of complaints from the teachers, said Vashishtha. Now we were asked... youve changed the textbooks to focus on more holistic learning. But shouldnt there be a matching evaluation process? 

 The source book also suggests ways to evaluate the academic progress of a student on a continuous basis without holding formal tests, said Sandhya Paranjpe of the NCERT. 

 It is very convenient for teachers to give tests. But we need to respect the fact that even primary school children think for themselves, and often know what they want to do, Paranjpe said.

 Eight schools each in two districts of Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Goa, Jharkhand, Orissa, Mizoram, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka will start using methods outlined in the book starting September 15.

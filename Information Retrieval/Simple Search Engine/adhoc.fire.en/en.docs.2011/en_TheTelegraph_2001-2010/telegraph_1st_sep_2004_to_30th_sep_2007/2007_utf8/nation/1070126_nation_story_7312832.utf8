 Mulayam majority

 Lucknow, Jan. 25: Mulayam Singh Yadav today proved his majority in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly with 223 MLAs 27 more than the 196 required in a House whose effective strength was reduced to 392 from 403. 

 Speaker Mata Prasad had debarred nine MLAs from voting. Ajit Singh and the Congress had withdrawn support early this month. 

 Another threat is a possible Supreme Court ruling that could disqualify 38 rebel BSP MLAs who have been supporting Mulayam since 2003. But with 27 more MLAs, he will scrape through.

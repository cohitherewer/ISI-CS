Washington, March 31: For the first time since the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation was created nearly 22 years ago, a Saarc summit is being noticed by the world.

 But ironically, the New Delhi summit on April 3 and 4 is getting global attention not because of South Asia. China, Japan and South Korea are sending their foreign ministers to the summit and the US will be represented at the level of a senior official.

 With four of the six countries in the six-party talks on North Korea present in New Delhi next week, it is inevitable that Pyongyangs nuclear programme will be a bigger priority among high-fliers from these states than poverty alleviation in South Asia.

 And if Irans application for observer status in Saarc is approved by the organisations standing committee of foreign secretaries tomorrow, Tehran may rush its foreign minister to New Delhi, anticipating automatic approval of its application by Saarc foreign ministers on Monday.

 With Irans detention of 15 British sailors rapidly developing into a new flashpoint in the Gulf, the entire complexion of the 14th Saarc summit will change if there is a high-level Iranian presence in India at this time.

 Privately, senior Indian officials say they were wishing that the observers were not represented at such a high level because it will cause some dilution in Saarcs basic mandate.

 This is the first time that Saarc is having observers: its Dhaka summit in 2005 approved the participation of China and Japan as observers. The two countries had sought that role several years ago. But once the applications from China and Japan were approved, South Korea, the US and the European Union joined the bandwagon and they were admitted by the Saarc council of ministers meeting in Dhaka in August last year. 

 Today, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon tried to underplay these misgivings and give some gloss to the presence of foreign ministers from outside the Saarc region. 

 He said the presence of observers enables the subcontinent to reconnect to itself and to the rest of the world.

 Menon said the New Delhi summit will give us an opportunity actually at a very high level to look at issues which interest our region and to look at our common development, our social and economic transformation as the charter of Saarc says.

 For Kabul, this will be its maiden Saarc summit, and Afghanistan is the first country without a border with India to gain entry into Saarc. With a high-level Afghan delegation accompanying President Hamid Karzai, the US observer, assistant secretary of state for South Asia Richard Boucher, will use that delegations presence in New Delhi to sort out unending problems between Kabul and Islamabad, according to American diplomats.

 China, Japan and South Korea will be allowed to speak at the opening or closing session of the summit in view of the presence of their foreign ministers. 

 According to a tentative decision by the Saarc standing committee today, the US and the European Union will be denied that privilege since they are represented only at the level of officials. 

 The observers will attend only these two sessions. Bilaterally, Chinese foreign minister Li Zhaoxings meetings with Indian leaders is expected to be the second-most significant interaction on the sidelines of the summit, next in importance to India-Pakistan meetings.

 This will be Lis second visit to New Delhi in as many months. Japans foreign minister Taro Aso met external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee in Tokyo only a few days ago. Their presence in New Delhi, given that background, is indicative of the high priority for India in Beijing and Tokyo.

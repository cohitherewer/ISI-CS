 After waves, human predators

New Delhi, April 2 (AP): Many women who were made homeless by the 2004 tsunami continue to live in poverty and face violence at relief camps in South Asian nations, including India and Sri Lanka, according to a report.

 Drawn up by the Alliance of Women Affected by Tsunami, the report covers India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. It was released in New Delhi on Saturday, just ahead of the two-day Saarc summit scheduled to start tomorrow.

 The alliance was created by Action Aid International, whose members include more than 170 NGOs and womens groups working in the tsunami-hit areas of India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

 Women who lost their livelihoods after the tsunami have been forced to take extreme measures to secure survival of their families and themselves, said Sriyani Perera, a spokeswoman for the alliance.

 The report highlighted the plight of one woman, who was forced to sell her kidney. We were shifted to a place where there is no work, no food to feed our children. I sold my kidney and got a small amount. They did not give me the promised amount. Now, I am suffering from heavy abdominal pain. I cannot work, the report quoted Kalpana, a woman living in a camp in India, as saying.

 Under normal circumstances, there is a high incidence of violence against women in South Asian countries, but tsunami-affected women reported that physical, sexual and emotional violence against them has intensified in the aftermath of the disaster that killed around 230,000 people, the report said. It, however, didnt include any statistics on such violence.

 Discussions with over 7,500 tsunami-affected women in five countries revealed that failure to involve women and girls in decision making on relief and rehabilitation fuelled their plight, it said.

 Women were left out of consultations, formulation of policies and design of programmes for relief operations, camp management, damage and needs assessment, allocation of houses and land and the rebuilding of livelihoods, the report stated.

 It urged the Saarc member states, notably India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives, to eliminate all forms of violence against women and ensure that their rights are protected in the wake of all disasters. 

 States have to guarantee appropriate access to education and health facilities for girls and women in post-disaster situations, the report stated. Also, governments have to ensure womens rights to land and their access to adequate housing.

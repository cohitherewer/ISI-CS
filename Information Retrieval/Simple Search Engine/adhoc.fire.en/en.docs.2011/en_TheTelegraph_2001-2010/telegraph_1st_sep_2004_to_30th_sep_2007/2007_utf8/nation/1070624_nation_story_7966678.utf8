 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Fake jackpot, real jail term

 It was a lottery never won, but he thought it would be a loan he could get away with without having to repay.

 Kola Venkata Krishnamohan achieved instant fame with his claim of having won the 1998 euro lottery Lotto but, nine years later, all he has in hand is a four-year jail term. 

 The Vijayawada STD booth owner thought he would survive a close call when he tempted some public sector banks and individuals into collectively lending him Rs 12.5 crore by showing forged papers about his Rs 83-crore jackpot.

 He furnished computer printouts of the lottery certificate and cheques of Londons Barclays Bank, where he claimed to have deposited his prize money. The cheques bounced and the papers were found to be fabricated. 

 Last week, as luck ran out on him in the deception game, Kola who earned the moniker Kola Lottery Mohan was also poorer by Rs 20,000. This is the fine that he has been asked to pay in addition to his jail term.

 Chennai power triangle

 The power triangle is in place. But the mystery over the apex continues to tantalise many in Chennai and Delhi.

 The guessing game began hours after Kanimozhi, DMK chief M. Karunanidhis redoubtable daughter and literary heir, was elected to the Rajya Sabha early this month.

 After the exit of Dayanidhi Maran from the cabinet, Kanimozhi has taken the prime spot in the power corridors of Delhi. The other two points of the triangle are M.K. Stalin in Chennai and M.K. Azhagiri in Madurai.

 But with 84-year-old Karunanidhi going strong, much of the speculation has centred on who in the trinity will eventually get to claim the crown. 

 Pundits agree that its all in the family now, but cant take their eyes off that wrestling bout waiting to unfold. 

 Race club on tight leash

 Like many turf wars, theres too much at stake in this one. 

 The Madras Race Club is under a shadow with the government asking the 60-year-old institution to stump up Rs 730 crore in arrears resulting from a lease fee hike that has been challenged in Madras High Court.

 The then Madras government had leased land to the 160-acre club at Guindy, on the fringes of the city, in 1946 for 99 years. 

 The annual rent had been fixed at Rs 614. Club officials claim this agreement is legally binding till 2044. The rent for the 99 years has already been paid.

 But in 2004, the government tried to raise the lease rent, prompting the club to move the high court for a stay. The government was asked to give reasons for the hike. 

 But before the legal tussle was over, another notice was sent last month informing the club about the increase and asking it to pay the arrears resulting from the higher rate. 

 Taste of Italy

 If Delhi has had its fill of Nirulas, Wimpys and McDonalds, heres one more to whet the appetite of fast-food lovers.

 Italys Sbarro plans to open 100 restaurants in India over the next five to 10 years. The first few will be set up in the capital. The quick service chain has teamed up with the local Hotz Industries for its India plan.

 We will introduce Italian food like pizza and pasta, for which there is a big demand in India. However, changes could be made in the menu later, said John Brisco, president of Sbarros international franchise division.

 Delhi: Catch a glimpse of the 2,500-year-old Kudiyattam this Sunday. Kathalkali, just 350 years old, has its roots in this ancient dance form. Students from Kerala, and one from France, will enact episodes from the life of Krishna at India Habitat Centre. The performance is scheduled at 7pm.

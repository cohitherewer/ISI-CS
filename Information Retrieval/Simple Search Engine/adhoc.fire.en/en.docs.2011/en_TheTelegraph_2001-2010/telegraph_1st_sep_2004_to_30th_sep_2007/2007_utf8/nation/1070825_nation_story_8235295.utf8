 Priyanka house

 Shimla, Aug. 24 (PTI): Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is set to build a house outside Shimla, but unlike one-time family friend Amitabh Bachchan, she will not have to prove she is a farmer to buy the land.

 The state has relaxed a law barring non-farmers from owning agricultural land.

 Priyanka is buying the four-and-a-half-bigha plot from a businessman. The process for registry has started, said Congressman K.S. Khacchi, who has the power of attorney.

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee also has a house in the state.

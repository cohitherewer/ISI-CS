 Priyanka puts kids before politics

 Amethi, April 22 (PTI): Priyanka Gandhi today ruled out entering active politics in the near future.

 I have small children and I need to spend time with them, which is my priority, Priyanka said on the second day of her roadshow here.

 I am here to help my brother (Rahul Gandhi) and support him in his plans.

 In most of her addresses, she mentioned Rahuls concern for the people and urged them to support Congress candidates. She said Rahul had a big task ahead of him in reviving the partys fortunes in Uttar Pradesh.

 Priyanka, who is the star campaigner and one of the few crowd pullers for the party, had acted as an election manager for her mother and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi for the Rai Bareli constituency in the last Lok Sabha elections.

 Batting for her brother, she had launched a scathing attack on Mulayam Singh yesterday saying no one should write-off anyone as a novice in politics.

 Priyanka said the Congress needs to interact more with people. There is a lot of organisational work that needs to be done. When I came here to fight my mothers elections, I found that the organisation was very weak and we slowly built it up, she said.

 So I think thats really what the need is. There is a need to build the organisation and more so, to have the workers connect directly with the people.

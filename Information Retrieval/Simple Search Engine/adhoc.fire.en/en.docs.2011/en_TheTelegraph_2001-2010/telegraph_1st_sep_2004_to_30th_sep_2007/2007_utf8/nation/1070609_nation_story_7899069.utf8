 Qaida scare in J amp;K

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, June 8: A man calling himself an al Qaida leader today released a CD in which an activist of the terror group is shown declaring war on India and warning that Kashmiri leaders are their legitimate targets.

 Abdul Rahman Ansari, who claims to be al Qaidas India chief, circulated the CD. 

 In the CD, a masked leader named Abu Ibrahim al Aasim is seen sitting with an AK-47 rifle. In the background is the al Qaida logo.

 We declare jihad on India and Kashmir is its gateway. It marks the advent of golden chapter in Kashmir jihad, Aasim says.

 The al Qaida leader accuses the militant and separatist leaders of Kashmir of conniving with Indian and Pakistani leaders to reduce Kashmir to a territorial dispute. 

 Under a global conspiracy, Kashmir has been turned into a mere territorial dispute between two countries. In places like Iraq, Algeria and Philippines, struggles are being waged purely for the glory of Islam, he says. 

 Aasim hits out at Hizb-ul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin, saying he is worse than Hurriyat leaders. They are secretly supporting the Hurriyat agenda. They are helping intelligence agencies of India and Pakistan wean Kashmiri mujahideen off jihad, he says. 

 Aasim describes Hurriyat factions as hypocrites and accuses them of fooling people. 

 A PTI report said Jammu and Kashmir police are probing the authenticity of the CD sent to a local news agency.

 In Delhi, home secretary Madhukar Gupta said the state government and the Centre would launch a probe. This has been done to scare people. We are aware of these tactics. There is no need to panic.

 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Clips to cuffs for pervert on bus

 He had a smutty video clip. She had a lesson to teach him.

 Prescilla Nadar had the courage to speak out where many women might have chosen to look away. The Navi Mumbai girl set an example for all those who silently put up with sexual harassment in public places.

 The 25-year-old from Vashi was on her way to office when a pervert sitting next to her on the bus kept thrusting the obscene clip on his mobile into her face. Fed up, Prescilla decided to treat Baban Wane to some real-life action. She snatched the phone and dragged the 30-year-old youth by his shirt to the police station. 

 What came as a shocker, though, was the silence of the co-passengers, none of whom stood up against the harassment and helped Prescilla.

 Things werent smooth even at the police station. An officer told Prescilla that she should have slapped the man and closed the chapter then and there. But she persisted, lodged the case and made sure Wane was arrested.

 Hi-tech brake on rogues

 Road rogues in Hyderabad could hit the dead end soon.

 The traffic police are marshalling a series of gadgets that will make it difficult for offenders to get away after a wrong turn.

 The first of the gizmos will be laser guns that will leave a mark on vehicles to show all previous violations. 

 The other showpiece is what the police are calling an interceptor. It is nothing, but a customised Toyota Qualis that can rotate 360 degrees and is equipped with a data bank that retrieves licence details in a few seconds.

 Next time, someone wants to surrender a fake licence, they better watch out. The interceptor will collect on-the-spot penalties and issue computerised receipts. Five of these vehicles will be on the prowl by next week.

 Chew on this one

 Grab a bite, pay the bill and walk away with a condom. After petrol pumps, ATMs and special kiosks, the safe-sex campaign has reached restaurants.

 An NGO in Tamil Nadu has convinced a highway eatery to change its name to Nirodh Hotel to make sure its dominant clientele of truck drivers get the message.

 Changing the name wasnt easy. After all, Nirodh, the brandname owned by state-owned Hindustan Latex Limited, could be mistaken as suggestive and indecent.

 After much persuasion, the hotel agreed. Gramalaya, the NGO, knew it made the right choice. The hotel is close to a LPG plant that draws about 200 tankers each day. Truck-drivers are a high-risk group for HIV. 

 As they munch, drivers are treated to some safe-sex posters. A box of Nirodh has been kept at the cash counter, in case somebody has missed the message.

 Plane truths

 A second airport for the capital has blipped on the radar.

 The civil aviation ministry has decided to take to the cabinet a ministerial panel decision that prevents a new airport from coming up within 75km of the existing one at Palam.

 A new airport is planned in Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh. The Mayavati government has already submitted a Rs 3,500-crore plan for the project to the Centre.

 But the committee that has imposed the restrictions says GMR, the firm modernising the existing airport, must have enough business to remain viable. A new hub, the argument goes, should come up when the existing one cant cope. The ministry expects to change that stance.

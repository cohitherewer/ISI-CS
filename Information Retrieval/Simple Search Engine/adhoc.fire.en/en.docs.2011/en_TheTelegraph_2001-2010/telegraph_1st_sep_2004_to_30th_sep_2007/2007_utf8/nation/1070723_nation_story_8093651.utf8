 Nuke strategic sweetener 

 - US deal expected to say terms are confined only to civil energy programme

 Kakodkar: Backroom player

 New Delhi, July 22: The nuclear deal reached with the US on Friday is expected to state that nothing in it will impede Indias strategic programme.

 This will be in addition to reprocessing rights and permanent fuel assurances. The agreement accepts that it is only about assisting India to develop a civil nuclear energy programme.

 Such an assurance will stand Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in good stead when he takes the nuclear deal to Parliament.

 The Prime Minister has been insisting that Delhi would never compromise its nuclear sovereignty.

 The assurance on the strategic programme could help Singh score political points, although such a concession was expected ever since the Americans accepted Indias separation plan (which drew a line between civilian and military nuclear functions) in 2005.

 As for the delicately worded compromise on assurances on nuclear fuel reserves, the US has told India that in case Delhi carries out a test in future and the law on ceasing assistance to a non-NPT country kicks in the Americans will ensure that other countries, like Russia or France, will step in to take Americas place.

 Until national security adviser M.K. Narayanan virtually adopted the nuclear deal as his own, atomic energy chief Anil Kakodkar held a real veto over every round of talks.

 So much so that Kakodkar, travelling with Narayanan and foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon to Washington last week, did not participate in a single meeting with the top political bosses of the Bush administration whether national security adviser Steve Hadley, secretary of state Condoleezza Rice or Vice-President Dick Cheney.

 Instead, he sat in his hotel room all through those four nerve-wracking days, waiting for the mountain to come to him.

 In this case, there were three men on the mountain: Narayanan, Indias US ambassador to the US Ronen Sen and Menon.

 Every two or three hours, according to sources close to the talks, this high command, along with Kakodkar, met to go over the latest initiative or offer, strategy or compromise.

 In every conversation, dialogue or negotiation with the Americans, Kakodkars invisible presence hung over the room, as if warning his compatriots not to give in too easily.

 Significantly, it was Narayanan who hit upon the idea of taking Kakodkar by the hand with him for this final Washington round of discussions.

 Narayanan knew that with time running out for the Bush administration, this was going to be a now-or-never last round in Washington. If a deal were to be reached before a new administration took over at the White House, Kakodkar would have to be brought around.

 So as the Indian officials, at various levels, negotiated with their counterparts, they insisted on the one unusual phrase: Nothing in this agreement will impede Indias strategic programme. It was a phrase that gladdened Kakodkars heart.

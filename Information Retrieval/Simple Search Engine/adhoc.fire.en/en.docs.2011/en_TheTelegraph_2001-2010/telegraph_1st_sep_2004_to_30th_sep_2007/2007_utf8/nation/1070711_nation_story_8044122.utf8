 Clerics set terms for nikaah on Net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Knot on the Net?

 Lucknow, July 10: The Dar-ul Uloom has ruled in favour of cyber marriages, but they should be performed in the presence of witnesses.

 A non-resident Indian based in West Asia had written to the fatwa section of the Islamic seminary in Deoband near Muzaffarnagar, saying he wanted to marry a girl from Meerut but did not have the time to travel to India. He wanted to know if he could take the help of the Internet to tie the knot.

 The Dar-ul Uloom gave him the green signal, but made it clear that eijab and qubool (proposal of marriage and acceptance) the rituals that precede a nikaah cannot take place on the Net. 

 Besides, fatwa no. 310/N added, both the bride and the groom should have a witness and a wakeel (lawyer) present when they take the vows.

 This is not going to be the first Muslim wedding in cyberspace. But in the earlier instances, the Dar-ul Uloom had not been consulted. 

 On May 7, 2005, Lucknow resident Shabnam had married Abdul Kalam, a computer engineer who lives in Saudi Arabia, after local religious leaders had given them the go-ahead.

 Wearing a long ghunghat (veil) and huddled among relatives, Shabnam sat in front of a computer in a cyber caf in old Lucknow and said qubool to Abdul, a web camera bridging thousands of miles of real space. A maulvi was present, too, reciting verses from the Quran.

 Since then, many Muslim couples had tried in vain to convince the Dar-ul Uloom to allow them to wed on the Net.

 It was only last year during a seminar in Lucknow attended by prominent Muslim personalities that the seminary softened towards the latest trend.

 The All India Muslim Personal Law Board president, Syed Mohammad Rabey Hasni Nadvi, and the rector of the Nadawatul Ulema of Lucknow had attended the meet. 

 Khalid Rasheed, a member of the law board, said cyber marriages via email would also be valid. The wakeels can mail their consent, which can be sent to the bride and the groom. 

 He added that voice mail could be used if the wakeels recognise the voice of the bride and the groom. 

 Rasheed said he had helped 10 long-distance couples tie the knot. 

 The Dar-ul Uloom fatwa has given a formal seal of approval to the practice. Earlier, couples would face problems in case of a clash between the marriage laws of two countries. But the seminarys order would render these differences ineffectual.

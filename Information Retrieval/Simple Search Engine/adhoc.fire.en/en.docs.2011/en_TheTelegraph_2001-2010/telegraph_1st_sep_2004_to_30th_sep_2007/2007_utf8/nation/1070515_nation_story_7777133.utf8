 Ahmedabad, May 14: The Maharaj Sayajirao University student arrested for putting up allegedly obscene paintings was released today, but the art fraternity kept up the heat.

 A demonstration was held outside the campus in Vadodara against the moral policing of the VHP and the BJP and in support of dean Shivaji Panikkar, who was suspended for allowing Chandra Mohan to exhibit the works.

 Last week, VHP and BJP activists had stormed the campus and vandalised the paintings that allegedly showed gods and goddesses in the nude. They were part of Mohans examination display. They also brought police to the campus and got the final-year fine arts student arrested.

 Panikkar, who backed Mohan, was asked to tender a public apology for hurting public sentiment by allowing the objectionable art show. When he refused, he was suspended.

 A local court released Mohan on a surety of Rs 5,000 and asked him to inform the police when he needed to leave Gujarat. Taking note of his clean record, the court said the paintings were not intended to be objectionable.

 Tension mounted outside the university as the warring groups came face to face. 

 Hundreds of artists from across the country were joined by MS University students and teachers as they gathered near the campus. When they were stopped at the university gate, they chanted: Moral policing down, down.

 BJP leader and advocate Neeraj Jain, the man responsible for Mohans arrest, organised a counter-rally at the same spot.

 The police had to intervene to avoid a possible clash and they brought things under control with a few arrests.

 After the protest, which lasted over an hour, the art fraternity held a meeting where it was decided that a national committee would be formed to fight for the reinstatement of Panikkar, who stood for academic freedom.

 The BJP activists and those of the ABVP the partys students wing wanted to provoke us, said Iftakar Ahmed, a faculty member of MS University. But we refused to retaliate as we know the university authorities, which acted on the complaint of Jain, are hand in glove with the moral brigade.

 He alleged that vice-chancellor Manoj Soni was an RSS activist.

 MS University students put up paintings expressing anger against the vandals and the university authorities.

 Slain college girls family seeks probe

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 2: Ishrat Jahan Razas family has demanded a CBI probe into the police encounter in Ahmedabad that killed her three years ago.

 The 19-year-old student of Khalsa College of Arts and Commerce in Matunga in central Mumbai was gunned down by Gujarats anti-terrorist squad led by D.G. Vanzara in 2004.

 Vanzara has been in the centre of a storm following revelations that Sohrabuddin Sheikh, accused of plotting to kill chief minister Narendra Modi, had been shot dead in a fake encounter in 2005. Sohrabuddins wife Kauser Bi, a witness to the incident, is also believed to have been killed and her body burnt.

 Ishrat, too, was charged with entering Gujarat to assassinate Modi along with Lashkar-e-Toiba operatives Zeeshan Johar, Amjad Ali Rana and Javed Sheikh, who was probably her husband.

 With the fake-encounter skeletons tumbling out of Gujarat polices closet, Ishrats family hopes to wipe off the stigma it has been living with for the last three years.

 Sitting in her first-floor flat in Mumbra in Thane district, Ishrats mother Shamima Raza said the familys cries that she had been murdered in cold blood went unheard. 

 The probe into the Gujarat police encounters has proved what we were saying. We want a fresh probe into Ishrats encounter, she said.

 Ishrats younger sister Nushrat echoed her, demanding an investigation by an independent agency like the CBI or Bombay High Court. 

 We want justice. The Maharashtra government should support us and ensure that a fresh inquiry is ordered into the suspicious circumstances of the encounter, said Nushrat.

 She said the family continues to face the stigma of being linked with a terror group. I avoid stepping out of the house. People point fingers at me, and say, Thats Ishrats sister. 

 Ishrats death also plunged the family into penury. Struggling to make ends meet after Ishrats father Mohammad Shamim died in 2001 leaving behind a family of eight, the girl tried to pitch in by taking private tuition after college. 

 Ishrats brother, Abdul Anwar, who used to work in a firm in Vashi, was sacked soon after the encounter. He is now employed in a cyber caf in Mumbra for Rs 2,000 a month.

 The encounter had shocked Mumbra, a largely Muslim suburb, with residents staging protests against Ishrats murder when her body was brought home. Over 25,000 people turned up for her funeral.

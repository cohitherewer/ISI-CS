 Court battles for big cats

 Jaipur, May 25 (PTI): The dwindling tiger count in the Ranthambore national park today prompted Rajasthan High Court to issue guidelines for their protection.

 Blaming vested interests for the fall in numbers, the court banned commercial and industrial units in the vicinity of the park. 

 Justice Ashok Parihar said the focus of the park authorities had shifted from ensuring the safety of the endangered animal to hugely funded projects. 

 With the influx of huge amounts in the projects sponsored by the Centre, the World Wildlife Federation and other sources, attention has been diverted to such funds instead of keeping a watch on the safety of tigers and other wildlife.

 On Wednesday, two tiger cubs drowned while another was rescued after they fell into a park well. 

 Justice Parihar also blamed the authorities for failing to find out the real fault and fix responsibilities. 

 He said the deputy forest conservator and the deputy field in-charge should be responsible for any poaching in the park. 

 It was only because of creating vested interests that there has been a phenomenal fall in the number of tigers and other wildlife. 

 A census has put the number of tigers in the park at 32 in 2006-07 against 35 in 2001-02.

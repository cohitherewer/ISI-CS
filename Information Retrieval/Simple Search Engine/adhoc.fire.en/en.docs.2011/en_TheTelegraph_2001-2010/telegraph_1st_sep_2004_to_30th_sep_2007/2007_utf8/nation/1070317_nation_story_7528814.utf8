 Mulayam judge chokes over letter

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lakshmanan 

 New Delhi, March 16: A Supreme Court judge who had ordered a CBI probe against Mulayam Singh Yadav and his family almost broke down in court today while talking about an absolutely heinous letter casting aspersions on him.

 I am sorry to say that me and my wife are very much disturbed. I am not even able to speak, a choking Justice A.R. Lakshmanan said, seeking to recuse himself from the bench hearing a plea for a review of the March 1 order written by him.

 Sources said the anonymous letter alleges that Justice Lakshmanan, who allowed the plea seeking hearing of the review petition in open court, would pass an order in favour of the Uttar Pradesh chief minister. In normal course, a review petition is decided in judges chambers.

 Disclosing his intentions at the outset, Justice Lakshmanan, who is due to retire next week, said the matter should go to the chief justice for listing before another bench.

 I am pained to receive a letter. In 17-and-a-half years of my career as a judge, and (including) five years in this court, I have not received such a letter, he said as former attorney-general Soli J. Sorabjee tried to calm him saying the place for such letters was a dustbin.

 Justice Altamas Kabir, the fellow judge on the bench that passed the order to probe Mulayams assets and was to hear the review petition in open court along with Justice Lakshmanan, said such a letter at a time he is retiring has caused hurt to my Lord.

 Justice Lakshmanan had received the one-page faxed letter at home this morning. The typed letter has been handed over to Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, but sources said he was not likely to take any action as it was anonymous.

 The chief justice later ordered hearing of the matter next week before Justice Kabir and another judge.

 Mulayams son Akhilesh Yadav had filed a petition seeking review of the judgment directing the CBI to probe allegations of amassing huge assets by the family through corrupt means.

 Mulayam refused comment, but his party general secretary Amar Singh said: There is no grouse as far as we are concerned against Justice Lakshmanan because he allowed an open hearing.

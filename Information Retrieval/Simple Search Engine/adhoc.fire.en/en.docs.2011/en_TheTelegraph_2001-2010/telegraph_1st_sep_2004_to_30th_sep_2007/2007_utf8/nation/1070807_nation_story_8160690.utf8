 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Bosses in Delhi, scion in parlour

 As his father and sister prepared for an eventful trip to Delhi in July, DMK scion Stalin was getting an image makeover designed to make sure he goes far enough.

 M. Karunanidhi

 and his poetess-daughter

 Kanimozhi were in Delhi

 to attend the swearing-in

 of Pratibha Patil. But

 there was also a family

 business at hand: Kanimozhi

 was to take her oath

 as a Rajya Sabha lawmaker.

 But away from the Delhi denouement, Stalin, called by supporters the DMKs rising sun, was blazing a new trail. New posters of the leader were springing up on the citys walls that made him look much younger and nattier. Some who saw the new images felt he was charming, too.

 DMK workers say in the pictures, shot recently, Stalin could pass off as a young groom. In one picture, Stalin might easily come across as somebody who combines the best of Kamal Hassan and Sarath Kumars features. There are signs the young crowd is loving the new look.

 But Stalin must be wary of the movie stars he might resemble. While Hassan has no taste for politics, he has to be careful about Kumar, whose ambitions are not secret.

 Ektaas star-studded series

 As far as TV series go, Ektaa Kapoor has dished out enough of them. But in July, she was the star at the launch of another one but it was a series of incense sticks.

 The new offering, Ektaas Karyasiddhi Graha Shanti Dhoop, was launched in the presence of parents Jeetendra and Shobha Kapoor. 

 Good friend and tarot car reader Sunita Menon is part of the new venture.

 Ektaa is known for her faith in astrology. Each package has seven kinds of incense sticks, for each day of the week. Their ingredients and colours are coordinated with the planetary significance, officials of Balaji Telebrands, a joint venture with Ektaas Balaji Telefilms, said.

 The incense sticks have been prepared keeping in mind vedic traditions on processing and blending. Chanting of appropriate mantras while lighting of stick increases its beneficial effects, Ektaa said.

 Bus boon for heritage zone

 The Delhi government will introduce 15 new CNG buses in the congested Chandni Chowk locality soon. 

 The buses, with lowered entry boards to assist the elderly and the differently-abled, will, the government hopes, blend into the old world charm of one of the capitals oldest areas. 

 Chandni Chowk is unique in its heritage value not just to the city but to India. The transportation needs of those who live there, however, need to move with the times, transport minister Haroon Yusuf said.

 Cycle-rickshaws, the backbone of public transport in the areas narrow lanes, were banned earlier this year. The buses are expected to bring to an end the travel woes of residents brought about by the ban. 

 The buses will stop at Chandni Chowk Metro station for those who wish to use the train. They will have 3.5-foot-wide doors. It was two feet in the old ones.

 Class action

 The Municipal Corporation of Delhi has decided to check abuse in its girls schools by transferring all male teachers.

 Only women teachers will be posted in the 512 girls schools. The civic body has said there will be no problem in getting the required numbers because there are more women teachers in the primary sections. Overall, the capitals civic body has 11,656 female and 6,001 male teachers.

 The move follows numerous complaints of harassment. A teacher was suspended last week after allegations that he molested six students in a Mangolpuri school. In another recent incident, a nine-year-old girl was allegedly molested by the principal of a Pushp Vihar school.

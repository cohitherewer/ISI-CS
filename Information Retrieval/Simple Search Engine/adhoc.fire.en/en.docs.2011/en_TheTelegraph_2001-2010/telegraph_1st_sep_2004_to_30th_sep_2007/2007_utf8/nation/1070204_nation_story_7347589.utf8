 Widow abuse cuffs on official

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Feb. 3: A Tamil Nadu official has been arrested after he allegedly tried to misbehave with a widow who had applied for monthly assistance from the state under a welfare scheme for destitute women.

 Police sources said the assistant in the tehsildars office in Salem had attempted to outrage the modesty of the 28-year-old widow, Maadhu, at her house last night.

 Maadhu, a mother of two kids, had applied for the monthly pension, recently doubled to Rs 400 by the new DMK regime. But her papers hardly moved and she was made to move from pillar to post, the sources said, adding that the accused, whose name was given as Madurai, even threatened to burn her pension papers.

 The sources said Madurai last night visited the womans house, ostensibly to check her identification marks, and asked the widows aged mother to leave the house before he began asking her indecent questions.

 A senior police official from Salem said the arrested official had no business to visit a would-be beneficiarys place for any such identification.

 Apparently, Madurai had some fancy ideas about the widow and tried to take sexual advantage of the womans plight, the sources said.

 A shocked Maadhu raised an alarm and some of her neighbours, who rushed to her house, rescued her. 

 Sources said Madurai has been charged under Section 354 of the Indian Penal code for trying to outrage a womans modesty and under the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Harassment to Women Act. If convicted, he could be jailed for at least two years, the sources added.

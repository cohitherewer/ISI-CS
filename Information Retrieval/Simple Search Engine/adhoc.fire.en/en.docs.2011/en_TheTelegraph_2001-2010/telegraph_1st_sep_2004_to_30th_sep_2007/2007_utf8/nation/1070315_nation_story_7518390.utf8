 New Delhi/Lucknow, March 14: The Election Commission today ordered major changes in Uttar Pradeshs top civil and police administration to ensure free and fair Assembly polls, following which a humiliated director-general of police sought voluntary retirement.

 DGP Bua Singh is among the officials whose transfer was ordered by the commission a day after the notification for the first phase of Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh.

 Additional DGP (law and order) A.C. Sharma, principal home secretary Satish Kumar Aggarwal, district magistrate of Etah Ram Kumar, inspector-general of Kanpur division Rizwan Ahmed, the DM of Saharanpur, and the commissioner and the special superintendent of police of Meerut are also on the list.

 In its communication, the EC asked state chief secretary N.C. Vajpayee to suggest a panel of names by 10 am tomorrow for replacing these officials. 

 The commission also appointed new DIGs at Agra and Meerut and a new additional SP at Khiri. The incumbents in these places were transferred on the basis of past indictments by the poll panel.

 I am feeling humiliated by the commissions decision... I have applied for voluntary retirement to the government, Bua Singh said at a hurriedly-convened news conference.

 Sources in the EC said todays transfer orders signalled the beginning of an exercise to ensure free and fair polls in the state.

 The Opposition parties had been expressing fears that the state administration would help rig the Assembly elections in favour of the ruling Samajwadi Party. The Mulayam Singh Yadav government had been accused of making use of the civil and police administration to rig the local bodies elections about two months ago.

 The Congress had cried foul over Bua Singh and Vajpayee attending Samajwadi Party meetings, where Mulayam mouthed political invectives against Opposition leaders. 

 The BJP, which also orchestrated protests against these officers, felt fair polls would not be possible if they were retained in their posts. The party was also vociferous in its demand for the ouster of Ahmed. The BJP alleged that the Kanpur IG was instrumental in suppressing cases in which party workers were attacked in his zone.

 The poll panel decided on the administrative shuffle at a high-level meeting held in Delhi today. 

 The Samajwadi Party reacted sharply to the transfer orders.

 It seems the Election Commission itself is not interested in holding fair polls in the state. It is playing into the hands of Congress, the partys chief whip in Parliament, Mohan Singh, said.

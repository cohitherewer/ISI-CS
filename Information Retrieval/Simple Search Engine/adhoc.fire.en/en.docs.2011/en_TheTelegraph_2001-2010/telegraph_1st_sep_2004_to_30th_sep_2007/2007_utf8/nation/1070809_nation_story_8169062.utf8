 BJP gets ready for battle in House

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: The BJP is not attaching much significance to the Lefts rejection of the Indo-US nuclear deal and does not plan to evolve any common strategy to corner the government.

 The party will, instead, raise the matter in a big way on its own.

 The Lefts hypocrisy and vacillation is well known, spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad told The Telegraph. We cant always be misled by the shadow-boxing. The Left is going to buckle under pressure. Anyway, the Left thinks Iran should make a bomb and India shouldnt. We cannot be part of this thinking.

 The nuclear deal was one of the many issues the NDA parliamentary party meeting today decided to raise in Parliaments monsoon session.

 The subversion of constitutional propriety in Goa and the Prime Ministers statement about turning the Line of Control into a Line of Peace are the other issues the Opposition would give importance to, senior BJP leader Sushma Swaraj said after the meeting.

 The meeting passed a resolution on Goa, which denounced the unconstitutional, unethical and patently partisan way in which attempts were made to save the minority Congress government.

 While the Trinamul Congress did not attend the meeting, the Biju Janata Dal said it was not informed. Shiv Senas Manohar Joshi was present.

 Quota stays on hold

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: The Supreme Court today refused to vacate the stay on the 27 per cent quota for Other Backward Classes in higher education. 

 It rejected as untenable the Centres appeal to selectively lift the ban from those institutes that had offered reserved seats in their prospectus before the March 29 stay. 

 We are not going to pass any interim order, PTI quoted the five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan as saying. 

 The Centres stand was that some institutions had increased seats and the general category would not be affected by the reservation.

 But the court said: We have considered the materials placed by you, and as regards the medical and engineering colleges, we cannot allow increase of seats.

 The bench said it would hear the main petition to examine the constitutional validity of the Centre Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act 2006.

 The government has been under pressure from its pro-backward allies such as the DMK, PMK and the RJD to ensure that OBC students were admitted in the IITs, IIMs and other elite institutions in the current academic year. 

 The Congress refused to react to the ruling, saying the matter was sub judice. 

 Arjun Singh, the human resource development minister and author of the quota drive, maintained it was not a setback.

 The delay was not on our part. At every stage, we were eager to get the matter resolved. Now we will see what can be done, the minister told reporters.

 Asked if the courts rejection would disappoint OBC students who had made the cut, Singh said: Obviously. We dont think they will celebrate. The ministry is trying to do what is correct. 

 But he would not elaborate on what he meant by correct. Instead, the minister put the onus of taking a call on the OBC students fate on the institutions that had cleared their admissions. It is entirely for the institutions to decide, he said.

 The minister also indicated the government might not move another plea before the court but wait for a judgment. Why should we anticipate that it will take that long? I dont think it will take that long. I am quite sure there may be a judgment.

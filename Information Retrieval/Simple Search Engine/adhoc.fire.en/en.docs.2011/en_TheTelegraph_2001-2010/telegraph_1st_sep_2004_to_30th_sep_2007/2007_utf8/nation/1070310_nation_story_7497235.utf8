 Liz takes phere, Jodhpur frowns

 Jodhpur, March 9: The day began on an inauspicious note. An astrologer said it was the wrong day to get married and Liz could be a manglik.

 At Mehrangarh, where the Liz Hurley and Arun Nayar wedding show moved after the saat phere, reporters fought with securitymen.

 There were other rumblings of discontent from many parts of conservative Jodhpur. Jodhpur is the metropolis of Marwar. We have a long tradition and way of doing things. A marriage comprises 16 rituals, said Govind Kalla, a dhrupad singer and cultural personality who doesnt think all rituals are being followed.

 We wish Liz Hurley and Arun Nayar all the best, but Liz, who has had several relationships and a son, is not our idea of a proper bride.

 Many women are also apparently upset, saying Liz, at 41, is too old to be a bride.

 Each of the two pundits, who entered the wedding venue around 4 pm, claimed he was the principal priest.

 But Elizabeth Hurley, daughter of Roy Hurley and Angela Titt, went ahead and married Arun Nayar, son of Vinod Nayar and Gunnar, at Umaid Bhavan palace, Jodhpur, this evening.

 Nayar wore a white sherwani and white churidaar with a golden sartaj on his pagri and matching golden jootis. He came riding a horse. There were 15 decorations for the horses. Liz was in a heavy designer saree.

 Many of the beautiful British guests who arrived in busloads at Umaid Bhavan wore gorgeously sequined pink sarees and heavy Indian jewellery.

 As evening descended on Umaid Bhavan glowing against a dark sky, Liz and Arun took the saat phere at 7.14 pm. They exchanged seven vows, too, one of which could have been: Arun will henceforth not be known as Mr Liz Hurley.

 Then the party left for Mehrangarh Fort where spirits will flow till dawn. As for the food, the highlight will be Rajasthani dishes: Makki ki roti and Lal Maans, elaichi-yukt murgh and bhuna paneer, supervised by chef Hemant Oberoi.

 The fort was closed the whole day.

 Umaid Bhavan has also been closed since Wednesday, causing annoyance to tourists who came to visit the premises on which its owner, former Maharaja Gaj Singh, lives too. Singh was conspicuous by his absence at the marriage.

 Tomorrow morning, Liz and Arun leave for Mumbai, where she meets her husbands parents.

 An Umaid Bhavan source threw some light on Aruns behaviour between the dos. He smokes too much and likes to wear only towels.

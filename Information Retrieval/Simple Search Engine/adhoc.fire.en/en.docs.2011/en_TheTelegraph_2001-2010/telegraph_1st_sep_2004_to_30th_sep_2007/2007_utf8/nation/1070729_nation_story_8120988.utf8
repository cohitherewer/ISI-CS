 Car, farm exports key

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 28: Bengals development hinges on successful farm-product exports and a thriving Tata small-car project, junior commerce and industries minister Jairam Ramesh believes.

 Sadly, the (countrys) agri-exports come from regions other than the east, which is naturally endowed for agri-products, he told the Indian Chamber of Commerce today.

 Agri-exports and the Singur project could emerge as major growth drivers, with the benefits going back to the farmers.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said that while Bengal has had success in agriculture, processing and value addition lagged at 3 per cent.

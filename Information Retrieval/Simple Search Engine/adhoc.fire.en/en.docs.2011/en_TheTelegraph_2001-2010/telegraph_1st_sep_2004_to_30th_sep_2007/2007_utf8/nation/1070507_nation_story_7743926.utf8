 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Not too old to corner cops

Mumbais senior citizens could learn a lesson or two from Maria DCosta when it comes to dealing with obdurate children. The 84-year-old went to Cuffe Parade police station to complain against son Alwyn for illegally occupying her flat. But the officer misbehaved with her, allegedly at her sons behest.

 Luckily, her tenant Ramesh Tekwani, a film producer who was with her, recorded the conversation. Armed with the tape, DCosta confronted Mumbai police commissioner D.N. Jadhav, who had little choice but to order an inquiry against inspector J.P. Shelar. 

 I have received the complaint from DCosta and have directed the deputy commissioner to investigate and take necessary action against the officer concerned, Jadhav said.

 The inspector cant wriggle out easily. The tape shows him telling DCosta to break open the door and take possession of the house. Instead, he should have been filing a complaint of house-breaking against Alwyn, who allegedly changed locks to prevent DCosta from entering.

 Fund-raising capers

Politicians are often accused of doing anything for votes. Recently, Hyderabad saw one power player play what he isnt. But the effort paid off handsomely.

 The man behind the antic was Chandrasekhar Rao. He played a petrol pump attendant, a room-service boy, a sugarcane juice vendor and a porter. The Telengana Rashtra Samiti boss wasnt really honing his acting skills, only raising money for his party from the gimmick. The toil earned him over Rs 2 lakh, the kind of money wannabe actors struggle to make.

 In 2003, the year the TRS was launched, Rao threw dinner meetings in the districts where one had to shell out over Rs 10,000 for a seat. Food festivals, musical evenings and fashion shows to promote Telengana came next. But many are wondering if the TRS, which now has a lavishly built headquarters in Hyderabads upscale Banjara Hills, needs to resort to the bizarre to raise money. 

 No brakes on traffic woes

How often have you cursed the traffic for a missed train or flight? Possibly, you have lost count.

 But last week 50 passengers decided not to just feel helpless. They lodged a complaint blaming traffic snarls near the Begumpet station for missing their train. Railway officials said this was a first for the city.

 he passengers said they managed to reach the flyover near the station but were stranded there for over 45 minutes. The culprits: VVIP convoys, a Baisakhi procession and an unusual Sunday scramble to malls.

 The complaint turns the spotlight on the traffic problems in the fast-growing city. 

 Civic officials blame the hold-ups on projects to widen roads and expand other urban amenities. We hope to be ready for the present size of traffic in the next two years, says municipal commissioner Sanjay Jaju. That doesnt sound fast.

 Odd burglar

A burglar who broke into vacant flats of MPs in Lutyens Delhi finally ran into a wall last week.

 Praveen Kumar of Muzaffarnagar was allegedly caught while he was on the job at a South Avenue flat. The booty recovered from him consisted of door and window handles and brass taps, police said.

 The 19-year-old confessed to committing similar thefts in flats in North Avenue, also home to many MPs and ministers. Houses on Parliament Street and Lodhi Estate were also among his targets. 

 His luck ran out when the occupant of one such flat that had been stripped of its upholstery lodged a complaint. That put police on the thiefs trail.

 Karat keeps up nuclear chant

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Mudigonda (Khammam), Aug. 21: If Sonia Gandhi has left for South Africa today, Prakash Karat headed down south but didnt change his tune. 

 In Mudigonda to unveil a martyrs column dedicated to seven land protesters killed in police firing on July 28, the CPM general secretary could not stop talking about the nuclear deal.

 The Congress and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will have to decide in a few weeks whether they want to sail with the US or the people of India, he told a large crowd of Left activists in the Khammam town, 211km northeast of Hyderabad.

 Karat alleged that the deal was not about nuclear cooperation alone but that the US had asked India to change its foreign policy. The CPM would not be party to the Centre compromising foreign policy for the sake of the 123 Agreement, he asserted.

 The tragedy is that the Congress party is jeopardising Indias independent foreign policy of non-alignment, founded by Jawaharlal Nehru and pursued for decades.

 When the CPM leader spoke about land and farmers, the US was still on his mind. The UPA government was following economic policies dictated by the US and the World Bank, Karat said, adding that these have driven farmers to suicide.

 Farmers suicides and the downslide in agrarian production cannot be resolved with corporate solutions, he said.

 The Left parties had propped up the UPA government to keep communal forces like the BJP out of power, he said. We are not there to support any strategic alliance that the Congress and Manmohan Singh plan to formalise with the US against the interests of the people of the country.

 Coming to the issue that brought him to Khammam, Karat accused the states Congress government of not keeping its poll promise of giving away vacant land to the poor. 

 The Left has led a land-grab campaign in the state, with the urban homeless and the rural landless forcibly occupying government land. On July 28, the agitation turned violent and seven persons were killed in the police firing.

 Karat said the national leadership of the Left supported the campaign and added: The YSR government is giving away poor mans land to big business and corporate houses.

 The second phase of land protest is to take off tomorrow.

 Advani gets back at PM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 10: It is difficult to attack L.K. Advani without expecting a quick retort. And Manmohan Singh realised it yesterday when the leader of the Opposition led a delegation of MPs from Gujarat to meet him.

 Two days ago, in Parliament, Singh had said: Our government and the home ministry have a better track record to show than the previous government. Compare the violence after the Godhra incident in Gujarat to the situation in Maharashtra after last years Mumbai blasts. 

 Smarting from the Prime Ministers remarks, Advani waited for his opportunity. And it came when he led the delegation of MPs to meet Singh yesterday.

 At the PMO, Advani delivered the punch. 

 Our government and the home ministry have a better track record to show than the previous government. Even when we have had terrorist incidents like the ones we saw during the NDA rule, we have not had a breakdown of law and order and upsurge of communal violence of the type we saw in Gujarat. 

 Your reply in Parliament has shocked and pained us. You talk about Indias 9 per cent growth rate when everyone, across the political spectrum, would agree that Gujarat is at the forefront of development. At the same time, the only reference to Gujarat comes when you talk about the riots, Advani reportedly told the Prime Minister.

 The repartee didnt stop there. How would it play out that every time we talk about the countrys political situation and economic growth, we get back to talking about the anti-Sikh riots in 1984, Advani is said to have asked Singh.

 Meet-costs call not dowry: SC

 New Delhi, Jan. 7 (PTI): Demand for money by the husband and in-laws for meeting domestic expenses would not come under the ambit of dowry warranting criminal prosecution, the Supreme Court has ruled. 

 A demand for money on account of some financial stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic expenses or for purchasing manure cannot be termed as a demand for dowry, a bench of Justices G.P. Mathur and R.V. Raveendran said.

 The judgment was delivered while setting aside the verdict of Bombay High Court which had affirmed a trial court sentencing a man to seven years rigorous imprisonment in a dowry death case. 

 Appasaheb was convicted for the death of his wife Bhimabai who had died within seven years of marriage by consuming poison.

 Though the husband and his mother were acquitted of the charges of cruelty and abetment, they were convicted on the charge of dowry death. 

 Quashing the conviction, the bench said: The utmost which can be held is that the husband had asked his wife to bring money for meeting domestic expenses.

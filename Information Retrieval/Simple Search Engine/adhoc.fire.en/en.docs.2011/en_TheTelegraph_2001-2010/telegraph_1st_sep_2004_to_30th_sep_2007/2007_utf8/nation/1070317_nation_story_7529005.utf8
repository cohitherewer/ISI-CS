 New varsity to ease CU load

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta University 

 Calcutta, March 16: Groaning under the weight of 170 affiliated colleges, with three lakh examinees every year and over 20 lakh answer scripts to evaluate, Calcutta University can finally expect some relief.

 The state government has decided to set up a new university in North 24-Parganas to cut CUs punishing workload.

 A full-fledged university will be set up in North 24-Parganas to reduce the existing load on Calcutta University, finance minister Asim Dasgupta today declared while presenting the state budget in the Assembly.

 The 150-year-old university, which has repeatedly requested the government to ease its burden, kept its fingers crossed. 

 Officials wondered whether the new institution might be another unitary university like Jadavpur University, powerless to give affiliation and therefore unable to take some of the load off CU.

 We are not aware of the plans for a new university in North 24-Parganas. But if the new university is given the status of an affiliating university, the colleges in North 24-Parganas (there are nearly 30 of them) are likely to be shifted to its jurisdiction, said Suranjan Das, CU pro-vice-chancellor, academic affairs.

 The university argues that a reduction of its huge workload, which it has to manage with less than 8,000 teachers, will allow it to focus more on improving postgraduate education and research.

 Senior university officials had met governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi, who is CU chancellor by virtue of his office, in June last year with a plan.

 Amend the law to transfer the colleges in North 24-Parganas to Rabindra Bharati University and those in South 24-Parganas to Jadavpur University, they had suggested. And put the colleges in Howrah under Bengal Engineering and Science University. 

 The finance minister said the new university, apart from teaching the regular courses and conducting research, would lay particular stress on courses related to application, such as applied economics.

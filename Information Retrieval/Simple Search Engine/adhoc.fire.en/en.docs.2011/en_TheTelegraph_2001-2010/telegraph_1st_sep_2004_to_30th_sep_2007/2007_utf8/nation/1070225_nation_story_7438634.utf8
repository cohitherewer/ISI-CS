 CBI lets slip chance to come clean

 Quattrocchi

 New Delhi, Feb. 24: The Central Bureau of Investigation had a chance to tell the Supreme Court that it knew about Ottavio Quattrocchis detention in Argentina, but did not.

 A Delhi-based lawyer today moved the court alleging that the bureau was guilty of contempt by withholding the information when an application he had filed on securing the presence of the Bofors accused came up on February 12.

 Ajay Agarwal said it was clear from media reports that the CBI maintained a discreet silence though it was aware of Quattrocchis detention on February 8, four days before his application came up for hearing.

 CBI director Vijay Shankar, however, said the announcement on the detention was delayed as the Italian businessmans identity needed to be verified and translation of documents from Spanish took time.

 Agarwal said the CBI should have given the latest information to the court, which had sought the bureaus response within four weeks after hearing the additional solicitor-general who represented the investigating agency.

 But the lawyer, whose application also sought directives to retrieve the money Quattrocchi withdrew after his London bank accounts were de-frozen, did not file a contempt petition. The court can, however, initiate contempt proceedings.

 Agarwal, who has sought orders to the CBI to take steps to secure Quattrocchis extradition from Argentina and a status report on the measures taken since February 8, has been filing applications in matters concerning the case. His appeal against a Delhi High Court verdict acquitting the Hinduja brothers is pending.

 The advocate had first moved an application seeking to prevent de-freezing of two bank accounts of Quattrocchi in London. The application was filed after reports that the Indian government, on whose request the accounts had been frozen, had requested authorities in Britain to de-freeze them.

 But the money was withdrawn before the matter came up for hearing. Agarwal then filed another application seeking the directive to the CBI to retrieve the money and produce Quattrocchi before the chief metropolitan magistrate as proceedings could begin only after the accused was presented before the trial court.

 In the periodical report before the magistrate last month, the CBI had said that the Interpol red-corner notice issued in 1997 was still in existence. However, information regarding his present whereabouts had not been received so far, and that as and when it is received, it will be submitted before the court.

 Quattrocchi is the only person accused in the case as the Hinduja brothers were absolved by the high court.

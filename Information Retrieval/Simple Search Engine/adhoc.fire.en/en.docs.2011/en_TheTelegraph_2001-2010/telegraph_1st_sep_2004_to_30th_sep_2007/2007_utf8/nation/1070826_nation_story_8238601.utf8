The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 With Salman, to Jodhpur

 STAR News reporter Siddharth Husain sat behind Salman Khan on the Jet Airways flight to Jodhpur on Saturday. As the plane took off at 11.35am 15 minutes after the actor had boarded it with brother Sohail, bodyguard and friend Shera, a family friend and lawyer Dipesh Mehta the occupants of seats 3D and 4D fell into a conversation. Heres what they said:

 Salman Khan (reading a local tabloid and amused by a front-page collage showing many celebrities behind bars): So, I am not alone. So many are there also. So, when are you people going back?

 Siddharth Husain: We will go back when you do.

 Sohail (to photojournalist accompanying Husain): Why do you people follow us like that? You should be careful. Today, if I hadnt slowed down, one of you would have been killed.

 SK: Then you would have said Salman has caused an accident again (laughs).

 SH: Salman bhai, how do you feel about Sanju (Sanjay Dutt)?

 SK: Look at the way he has suffered! The delay caused him so much trauma. I can totally understand his situation.

 (Husain says the actor was not his usual brash self: he spoke very softly and a listener had to strain his ears.)

 SK: Five people have been acquitted (in the chinkara case). I dont know why they are after my life. I am innocent. But I respect the law.

 SH: Are you scared?

 SK: No, I am not. Just pray for me.

 (Soon, Salman and Sohail order lunch and an assortment of non-vegetarian food is served to them. Salman asks for a bottle of water. Husain tries to take a peek at the actors plate.)

 SK: Ab paani ka rang bhi dekhoge kya (You want to see the colour of the water, too)?

 SK (a while later): Since when have you been waiting outside my house?

 SH: Since 2am yesterday.

 SK: Did you have the breakfast I sent you all?

 SH: Yes, I did.

 (Husain switches on his mobile phone as soon as the flight lands at 1.10pm, and it starts ringing. Sohail asks him to switch it off.)

 Sohail: Arre, you can send all the news back once we land. Ten minutes will not harm you.

 As the brothers get off the plane, they seem tense, their jovial conversations on board all but forgotten.

 Sohail manages a smile at Husain but Salman looks nervous. At the airport, the actor, along with his entourage, is escorted into a cabin crowded with about 25 policemen of various ranks.

 A while later, Salman, Sohail, the friend and lawyer Mehta are herded into a police Gypsy. Shera tries to get in, too, but is pulled back by policemen. 

 Salman stretches his hand out towards the bodyguard, for years a pillar of strength for him. Nothing doing, say the police.

 Later, as Salman walks into jail, Sohail, Shera and his lawyer watch from a Scorpio.

 They hand Salman a bag containing toothpaste, a toothbrush and other toiletries along with a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. But jail superintendent Otaram says the actor will not need them.

 He will be given jail clothes: a loose white shirt and white pyjamas. He will not get special treatment, insists the official, said to have been especially kind to Salman during his earlier stint in the jail after his conviction in another poaching case in April.

 Salman will meet another familiar face: lifer Mahesh, who kept him company at barracks No. 1 the last time, too.

 Bhai has faced this before, the friend says. He is only worried about his parents. He knows his father is strong, but he is anxious about his mother.

 When Salman was sent to jail in April, mother Salma took ill and needed to be admitted to hospital.

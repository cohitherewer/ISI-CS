 NRI lover battered to death

 Melbourne, Feb. 25 (PTI): A couple has been charged with the murder of a man of Indian origin who allegedly had an affair with the wife.

 Diane Goundar, 26, of Prestons, appeared before Parramatta bail court in Sydney and was denied bail after the prosecution pleaded that she may flee the country.

 Her husband and co-accused Munesh Goundar fled to New Zealand last Wednesday, police said.

 The court was told that Munesh recently found out about the affair between Diane and the victim, Rajnesh Singh. 

 On February 11, Munesh allegedly ordered Diane to invite Rajnesh home. When he arrived, Diane took Rajnesh to the master bedroom upstairs where her husband, who was hiding in the wardrobe with a kitchen knife, attacked him. Munesh then pushed the victim down the hallway into the bathroom, where he stabbed him in the back.

 It is alleged that he ordered Diane to close the windows and turn the radio on loud so that nothing could be heard outside.

 Diane watched as her husband allegedly hit her ex-lovers head and then dragged him, still alive, to the bathtub, the Sun Herald daily reported. 

 She was then asked to leave the house and when she returned, she was told that Rajnesh was dead. 

 The duo allegedly placed the body in the boot of his vehicle and drove to Heathcote, where the body was dumped.

 A search of the couples house has revealed bloodstains.

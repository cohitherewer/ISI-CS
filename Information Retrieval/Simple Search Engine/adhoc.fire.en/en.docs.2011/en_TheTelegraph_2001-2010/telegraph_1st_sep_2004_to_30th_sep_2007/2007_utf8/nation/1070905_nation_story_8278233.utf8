The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Mothers last moments

 - Today is 10 years since she left us. Five people who knew Mother Teresa remember her

 Photographer

 Name: Raghu Rai 

 Rai has done three books on Mother 

 What he was doing when Mother died: 

 I was in Delhi, at home. When I heard the news, I realised she was more than a saint to me.

 Last recollection of Mother: 

 I did three books on Mother. The second was completed when she was sick and was not meeting people. Navin Chawla had written the text. We went to meet her two months before she passed away to present her a copy. 

 Mother was brought on a wheelchair by two sisters. Her smile was as warm and loving as always. There was no trace of illness in her smile. We presented her the book. She just flipped through it, passed it to somebody and blessed us. That was also the last time I took photographs of her.

 What he misses most about her: 

 She was the rarest of human beings. I met her for the first time in 1970 and she was so simple, ordinary, loving and yet so tough. Even after receiving the Nobel Prize and Bharat Ratna, there was no change in her.

 Has Calcutta become less or more compassionate after her death? Why?

 We are all becoming less compassionate. This is because of globalisation, money is flying. Nobody has the time to be compassionate.

 Does Calcutta still need a Mother? Why? 

 Who doesnt need a mother? 

 Beneficiary

 Name: John Mendez

 Was an alcoholic, had lost his job as a waiter and was shunned by his family when Mother found him. Now works for a transport company

 What he was doing when Mother died: 

 Had just returned home from work. I rushed to Mother House. The tears came uncontrollably to my eyes, and I felt like I had lost my own mother.

 First recollection of Mother:

 When I first met Mother Teresa, I was an alcoholic and a vagabond. I was hungry and ill, sitting at the Ripon Street-A.J.C. Bose Road intersection when Mother came to me and took me to Nirmal Hriday. There I was brought back to life and was inspired to do my bit.

 I started working in a transport company and went back to my family. Whenever I had the time, I went to Mother Teresas to serve. 

 Has Calcutta become less or more compassionate after her death? Why?

 The city has become more compassionate than before, but it needs to go a long way for Mothers dream to come true. 

 Does Calcutta still need a Mother? Why? 

 A mother figure that can lead all the selfless servers is the need of the day, but there are few that can match her stature.

 Volunteer

 Name: Daisy Rosario

 Met Mother Teresa in church and has since worked at Missionaries of Charity. 

 What she was doing when Mother died: 

 I was at home. Then I went to Mother House to pray for her.

 First recollection of Mother:

 The first time I saw Mother was in St Teresa of Avila Church. I was surprised to see her sitting humbly with everyone else. After mass was over, I went to seek her blessings and she asked me to visit Shishu Bhavan. I went and was inspired to join the volunteers.

 What she misses most about her:

 I miss her gaze, it was so powerful it went straight to the heart and had a profound effect on me. It encouraged me to see life in a new perspective.

 Has Calcutta become less or more compassionate after her death? Why?

 People have learnt from Mothers example, and the city is definitely more compassionate to the poor and destitute than before.

 Does Calcutta still need a Mother? Why?

 There is a dire need for a mother figure in Calcutta, even though Mother Teresas sprit lives on in the work she began, and is reflected in every person who has followed her example.

 Doctor rsquo;s wife

 Name: Dr Seba Bardhan

 Got to know Mother through husband, Dr A.K. Bardhan, who was her physician.

 What she was doing when Mother died: 

 Rushing to Mother House with my husband after being summoned by the Missionaries of Charity, but it was too late. God took her in our absence. My heart was torn apart.

 First recollection of Mother:

 My husband was treating Mother Teresa at Woodlands years back when I first saw her: she was in deep prayer for over half an hour. She opened her eyes and I encountered a joy and felt that somehow I knew her. That day on, I became one of her daughters. 

 What she misses most about her: 

 I particularly miss her touch, her talk. 

 Has Calcutta become less or more compassionate after her death? Why?

 Compassion is in every heart, and some express it silently. At Mother House, sisters and helpers silently pray and work without expecting any reward. 

 Does Calcutta still need a Mother? Why? 

 Mother is there, her spirit is still alive and inspires others. We are Mothers children, and she is with us. She was a messenger of peace, her work was Gods work, we miss her physically and we do need a mother figure.

 Social worker

Name: Chandramani Agarwala

 Mother saw her working with destitute children and stopped to talk. Since then, a relationship developed.

 What she was doing when Mother died: 

 I was at home.

 Last recollection of Mother:

 Visiting Mother House after she had passed away: inside, everyone was praying in silence but outside, lots of people had gathered and were crying uncontrollably. 

 First recollection of Mother:

 The first time I met her she was talking to children and the effect was evident all the children had love in their eyes. I have always regarded her as a karmayogi.

 Has Calcutta become less or more compassionate after her death? Why?

 People are more conscious that the work Mother started should continue. More are coming forward selflessly to help.

 Does Calcutta still need a Mother? Why? 

 Her services are definitely needed.

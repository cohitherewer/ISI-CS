 Indore, March 14: A Haryana police team probing last months Samjhauta Express blasts has held two suspects from Indore.

 Huzaifa and Puran Singh Thakur have been taken to Panipat in Haryana, where the train carnage took place, for questioning after a local court issued a transit remand.

 Huzaifa owns a shop, Abhinandan Bag Store, in Kothari Bazar from where the suitcases, in which the bombs were allegedly kept, were bought. Thakur is the manager of the shop.

 The Haryana police team, which has been camping here for over two weeks, claimed the covers of three unexploded suitcase-bombs found at the blast site were also purchased from the shop. Similar cloth was seized from the shop and sent for laboratory analysis.

 However, there were conflicting claims on the duos involvement in the crime. While Indore range IG Rajendra Kumar said they were picked up yesterday for not cooperating with investigations, the Haryana police team dubbed them as prize catch.

 They can prove helpful in identifying the culprits behind the blasts. We have detected that the covers for the briefcases too were stitched in Indore, a police officer said.

 Privately, Madhya Pradesh police do not share their Haryana counterparts enthusiasm on the arrests. They said mere purchase of suitcases or covers did not establish anything. It is all too early to jump to any conclusion, an official said.

 Although Indore and surrounding areas have pockets where activities by the banned Islamic Students Union of India flourish, local police officials said they are yet to establish a link between the organisation and the detained duo.

 Mulayam faces battle within

 DHIRENDRA K JHA.

 New Delhi, March 28: Even before the first vote is cast for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, the ruling Samajwadi Party is caught in a whirlwind created by its own rebellious heavyweights across the state.

 From Gorakhpur in the east to Muzaffarnagar in the west, chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav is facing an unprecedented challenge from within his party just when he is getting ready for what is being seen as the most crucial poll battle in his political career.

 Till recently, the partys Agra MP Raj Babbar alone held the flag of rebellion. But in the run-up to the April-May elections, more voices of dissent have started emerging from different parts of the state, threatening to damage the partys poll prospects.

 The rebellion of Beni Prasad Verma, another Samajwadi MP and Mulayams political companion for three decades, is threatening to take away the partys Kurmi votes, especially in Barabanki, Bahraich and Faizabad districts.

 Verma, who has been the Kurmi face of the Samajwadi party, has now formed his own party, called the Samajwadi Kranti Dal, which has an alliance with the Indian Justice Party of Udit Raj.

 Further east, Mulayam is facing the rebellion of former party MP Kunwar Akhilesh Singh, who wields considerable influence in and around Gorakhpur. Akhilesh Singh wanted a Samajwadi ticket for his brother Munna Singh and took up the banner of revolt when it was denied. 

 As Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati pitched in to fish in troubled waters by providing a ticket to Munna Singh, Akhilesh Singh has started campaigning for the Samajwadis arch rival in the state.

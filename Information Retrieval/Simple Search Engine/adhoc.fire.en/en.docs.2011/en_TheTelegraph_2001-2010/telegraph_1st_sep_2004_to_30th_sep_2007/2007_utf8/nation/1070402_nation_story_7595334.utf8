 Lay-off protest shuts Big Bazaar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 1: Retail chain Big Bazaar was today forced to shut its outlets in the city because of a protest against the retrenchment of 120 employees.

 The Bhartiya Kamgar Sena, the Shiv Senas trade union wing, extended support to the striking employees. Later, the management was believed to have agreed to take back the sacked employees. 

 The Kamgar Senas involvement sparked fears of trouble at the Big Bazaar outlets in Lower Parel, Mulund and Kandivli. Local police stations had deployed forces to protect the outlets and to avert violence. But barring a minor incident of stone pelting at the Lower Parel outlet, the protests passed off peacefully, police said. 

 Sources said the decision to reinstate the sacked workers with immediate effect was taken after the management of the Kishore Biyani-owned chain met a delegation of protesters in the evening. There was no official word, though, that the jobs were being returned.

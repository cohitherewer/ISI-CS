 Match for Maya mascot

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mulayam

 Lucknow, Sept. 14: Mulayam Singh Yadav feels he has found the social engineer to rival Satish Chandra Mishra, the Brahmin face who fashioned Mayavatis triumph.

 Like Satish, the Samajwadi Partys new find is also a Mishra Kripa Shankar Mishra. But the similarities end there. The BSP leader is a lawyer and an ace at forging winning caste combinations. Kripa Shankar, a veteran Ayodhya priest, is more into scriptures and chants.

 Bhur Bhubasya Tasbitu is what you hear for almost 30 seconds on his phone before he comes on the line. But Mulayam believes he has the mantra for success.

 The entry of Kripa Shankar, a magnet of sorts to draw Brahmin voters, is being seen as part of the Samajwadi Partys efforts to gear up for the 2009 general elections.

 Kripa Shankar is the president of Sanatan Brahmin Samaj, an Ayodhya-based organisation that he says has a presence beyond Uttar Pradesh. 

 My organisation has a network in nine states, including Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The Samajwadi Party will use our platform to woo Brahmins. 

 He says he has worked for the BJP in the past and the BSP in the polls this year but feels it is time to hitch himself to Mulayams bandwagon. He (Mulayam) means business, Kripa Shankar says.

 He has other reasons, too. The Mayavati government is being run with the support of the Brahmins, but they arent being supported. This is an insult to them. 

 One of his immediate plans will take shape this weekend, when he launches a Brahmin Mahasabha on September 16. Uttar Pradesh could witness a battle of two Mishras.

 The Samajwadi Party has so far relied on its traditional votebank: the Yadav-Muslim combination reinforced by pockets of backward castes. Among upper castes, Mulayam has courted the Thakurs. The most recognisable faces in the Thakur lobby are Amar Singh and Raja Bhaiyya. 

 But after Mayavatis success, even Amar Singh appears to have changed his mind about the Brahmins.

 Asuron ka nash karne ke liye Brahman chahiye (To kill the demons, it is necessary to have Brahmins), he said yesterday.

 Mulayam sees signs of disquiet among the Brahmins. They are already disillusioned with Mayavati, he said. He added that the Brahmins and the Thakurs had approached him with complaints that their land was being taken away by the Mayavati government.

 However, even insiders in the Samajwadi Party say it will be an uphill task for Mulayam to bring the Brahmins and the Thakurs, who are deeply suspicious of each other, together.

 The presence of Amar, a Thakur, at the helm of the Samajwadi Party might be a reason to put off the Brahmins.

 Georges Mulayam link irks Dal, BJP 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 24: The imminent split in the Janata Dal (United) has triggered a debate in the BJP about the future of the NDA.

 George Fernandes heads the rebel camp in the JD(U) that is trying to revive the erstwhile Samata Party. He is also the NDA convener. It would embarrass the alliance if the present JD(U) leaders party president Sharad Yadav and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar were to insist that the NDA should sideline Fernandes and the Samata Party. For the time being, the BJP is banking on Sharads decision to watch Fernandess moves.

 If it is just another political formation, we would have no problems welcoming the Samata Party into the NDA. The JD(U) is, of course, an important political ally. But none of the senior leaders in the JD(U) wants to hurt Fernandes, a senior BJP leader told The Telegraph.

 But the situation is likely to change very soon. Fernandes (in picture) hasnt made any secret of his proximity to the Samajwadi Party and Mulayam Singh Yadav. On October 12 last year, Mulayam asked Fernandes to organise a function on the birth anniversary of Ram Manohar Lohia. Ever since, Fernandes has been actively involved in Mulayams struggle to reclaim the Lohia legacy in the run-up to the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.

 The former defence ministers flirtation with the Samajwadi Party is in contrast to the political formations being worked out by the JD(U) in Uttar Pradesh. Sharad has struck an alliance with the Apna Dal on an anti-Mulayam plank.

 He has so far ignored Fernandess overtures to Mulayam. But sources in the BJP said if Fernandes goes to the extent of helping Mulayam during the Uttar Pradesh elections, Sharad has promised to take action against him.

 We will be in a real mess if Fernandes decides to help Mulayam during the elections. Not only will Sharadji not tolerate him going so far, it would reflect very badly on the BJP as well. After all, he is the NDA convener and his conduct would definitely have a bearing on the BJPs campaign against the UP government, said a BJP source.

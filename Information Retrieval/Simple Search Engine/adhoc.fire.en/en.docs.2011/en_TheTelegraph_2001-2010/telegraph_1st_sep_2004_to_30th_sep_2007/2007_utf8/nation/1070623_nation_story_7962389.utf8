 Backlash at Anara film

 Jammu, June 22: Anara Guptas debut film is showing in 10 cinema halls in Mumbai, but in hometown Jammu an uproar against the movie has kept it from hitting the screen.

 Miss Anara, the film based on the former Miss Jammus life, has sparked protests from the Shiv Sena. 

 Krishan Manhas said the film would have an adverse impact on the minds of people. It would encourage a culture of vulgarity and immorality that by indulging in bad acts, people can make it big, he said, as his men shouted slogans against Anara.

 The beauty queen hit the headlines in 2004 when she was arrested for allegedly appearing in a sleaze CD. Anara was acquitted after a forensic laboratory declared the girl in the film was not her. 

 Following this, the state director-general of police, in a written statement, accepted that Anara had been kept in illegal custody. Five officers were suspended after the police case fell through. 

 But the sleaze CD controversy has put Anaras film at risk. Hall owners are refusing to screen it fearing vandalism. 

 The managing director of Jammus Hari cinema, Vijay Mahajan, said: Lack of security and constant threats from various organisations prevented us from screening the movie today. 

 The Sena and the Hindu Shiv Sena are demanding a nationwide ban on the film. They burnt Anaras effigy during the day. 

 The case of her alleged involvement in a porn CD is still pending in high court and the release could hamper a fair verdict in the case, one Shiv Sainik said. 

 Mother Raj Rani, however, is hopeful that her daughter will see success. A few people with vested interests do not want the truth to surface.

 Elder brother Kumar Sambhav, who is with Anara in Mumbai, said the movie was witnessing good audience response. The protests in Jammu against the movie is the handiwork of police, he said over telephone. 

 Her (Anaras) feelings are hurt as her hometown is gripped by protests and she least expected it.

 Young India happiest: Study

 G.S. MUDUR

New Delhi, Sept. 20: Young people in India have shown up happiest satisfied with their own personal lives and the situation in the country in a 17-nation web survey.

 The levels of satisfaction and optimism about the future of society were higher among young people in India than in Europe, US or China, according to the Global Youth Survey 2007 conducted by Swedens Kairos Future. 

 Indians appear to be the happiest in this survey, coming out strongly on personal satisfaction, said Anna Kiefer, director of Kairos Future, a research and strategy organisation that investigates trends that could provide authorities and companies information about citizens and consumers. The survey analysed responses from 22,000 young people, most between 16 and 29 years, across 17 countries.

 The survey also found that work and high status were more important to young Indians than to Europeans, who favoured good living conditions over work, a PTI report said.

 Seven out of 10 young Indians were happy with the situation in the country against three out of 10 Americans and Europeans. Among the 1,000 young people surveyed in India, 83 per cent were satisfied with their lives. The figure was 68 per cent in the US, 65 per cent in Europe and 58 per cent in China. 

 We see a correlation between (economic) growth and happiness in society, but there are likely to be cultural issues also, Kiefer told The Telegraph on phone from Helsinki airport just before catching a plane to Delhi, where she will present the surveys findings tomorrow.

 However, Kiefer cautioned that the findings may not truly represent the entire population in India because the survey was done through the Internet. Participants were required to respond to a 25-minute online questionnaire.

 The results would be more representative of the populations in Europe or America, where Internet penetration is much higher, she said.

 The survey has also shown that youths in India are traditional and modern at the same time. The exercise found that while 80 per cent of the young people in India believed in the importance of passing on religious faith or spiritual values to children, the proportion of young people with similar views was 57 per cent in the US, 25 per cent in Europe and 22 per cent in China. 

 The priorities of Indian youths good career and high status are reflected in their values of endurance and entrepreneurship. Indian youths are also strikingly more optimistic about their own future and about the future of society, said Kairos Future CEO Mats Lindgren.

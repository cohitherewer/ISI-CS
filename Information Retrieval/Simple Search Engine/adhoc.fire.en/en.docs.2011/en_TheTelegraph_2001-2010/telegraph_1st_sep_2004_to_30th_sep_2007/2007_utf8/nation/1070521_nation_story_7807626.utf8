 CBI sets sights on mosque probe

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 20: The CBI wants to probe the Mecca Masjid blast.

 The central agency is hoping that it will be part of the investigation as it wants to avoid a Malegaon-like situation, where the CBI was asked to step in after Maharashtra police were through with their probe.

 The investigation into last years blasts in Malegaon has almost reached a dead end as it has become tough for the CBI to find new clues.

 CBI officials said one of the biggest stumbling blocks for the agency was the extensive chargesheet filed by Maharashtra police. 

 The state law enforcers wrapped up the case blaming the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (Simi) for the explosions on September 26 last year, which claimed 26 lives. 

 The CBI took over the probe in December after local minority groups voiced dissatisfaction over the police claims. But there was not much left to be done.

 The agency is still collecting evidence to file an additional chargesheet, something that the officials find difficult in the absence of any credible evidence. 

 The central agency has not been able to take the probe further and establish the involvement of terror groups like the Lashkar-e-Toiba or the Jaish-e-Mohammed. Neither does it have any evidence to prove that these groups had used Simi in executing the blasts.

 The Union home ministry and the state government are not averse to handing over the Mecca Masjid probe to the CBI.

 Andhra Pradesh polices revelation that Jaish could be involved is a significant development, according to the officials. 

 They said it was important to probe the Hyderabad blasts links with the Malegaon incidents. The investigators want to pursue the two cases together.

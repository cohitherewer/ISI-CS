 Priya picks Parzania to mend image

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: After playing nanny to errant TV channels, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has decided to make amends and prove hes not that illiberal after all.

 The reason could be anything a cryptic remark from the highest level within the Congress or a mid-course image correction or plain political expediency.

 Whatever, for starters, the information and broadcasting minister has pegged his plans on Rahul Dholakias Parzania, which has not been screened in Gujarat. Das Munshi said he would organise a special screening of the film, based on a Parsi couples real-life search for their son lost in the Gujarat riots, for members of Parliament during the budget session, which starts on February 23. The press will also be invited, he said today.

 As a Congress team from Gujarat arrived here to seek the ministers intervention to get Parzania on the states theatre screens, Das Munshi said if the delegates met him, he would tell them: I can ensure that copies of the film reach Gujarat safely. But the political and agitational parts, they will have to do.

 Ever since he said he would take action against four or five TV channels for exhibiting objectionable content, murmurs against Das Munshi have been audible within the Congress. His responses are out of sync with the times. We cant be speaking about reforms in every sector and then get strait-laced about TV channels, said a young Congress MP.

 Whether the criticism reached his ears or not is not known. But at a social event of the Congress last week, Das Munshi was told by a well-wisher that Sonia Gandhi wondered why his morale was so high after he suspended the AXN channel for purveying allegedly lurid commercials.

 Congress sources said Das Munshi couldnt figure out if the purported comment was charitable or barbed. He was puzzled. Had Madam actually praised him for doing the right thing (with AXN) or did she think he went a bit overboard? said a source.

 It is believed that the Prime Minister, too, wasnt happy with Das Munshis interventions.

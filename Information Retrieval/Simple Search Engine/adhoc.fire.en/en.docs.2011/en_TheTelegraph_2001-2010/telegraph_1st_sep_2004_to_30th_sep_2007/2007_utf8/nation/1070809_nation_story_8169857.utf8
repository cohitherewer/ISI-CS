 Weightless test in Florida, for pleasure trip to space

 JOHN MARY

 Santhosh

 Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 8: 

 Voyager No. 38 will soon get to know how it feels to be 

 weightless.

 That, too, on good old Earth.

 Its the rite of passage space voyagers have to go through to test how fit they are for the demanding journey. 

 For Santhosh George Kulangara booked on Richard Bransons Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo flight next year and set to be Indias first space tourist the initiation will be at Floridas Kennedy Space Center where he will get a days zero-gravity training.

 The 35-year-old, one of the most widely travelled Indians, will be taken on board the G Force-1 aircraft of the Zero Gravity Corporation for a simulated flight to give him an idea of weightlessness when he is actually on the spaceship.

 Before his departure yesterday, Santhosh told his friends he never had a second thought about spending $200,000 on the space trip.

 Its not merely the fancy of travelling to space, feeling zero gravity and seeing the globe from above. I can take my camera on board and cover the space journey, besides gaining access to Virgin Galactic footage, Santhosh said.

 The Kerala resident, who has been to more than 50 countries, published two books on his travels and runs a visual travelogue on a Malayalam channel, had got a letter in March from Virgin Galactic president Will Whitehorn, confirming his status as a voyager. I am pleased to confirm that you have been allocated Voyager reservation No. 38, the letter said.

 A.U. Ratheesh, who collaborates in the travelogue, said the Zero Gravity Corporation flight would test the tourists physical endurance.

 SpaceShipTwo will travel 400,000ft above Earths surface, higher than the internationally recognised definition of space at 100km or 330,000ft. Twenty experience-optimised passengers will get to glimpse Earth from 70-80 miles above in sub-orbit. The flight will last two-and-a-half hours.

 Breaking government monopoly on space flights has been a dream shared by both Branson, the Virgin Atlantic chief, and Burt Rutan, who designed the path-breaking SpaceShipOne that made three flights to altitudes greater that 100km during 2004. That opened new vistas in space tourism.

 The spaceship will reach the maximum speed of 4,800kmph or four times the speed of sound approximately 90 seconds into the flight.

 Santhosh had made an initial payment of $20,000 while booking the flight. I sent in my request as far back as 2004 after the first private space flight was accomplished, said the Kottayam native, who is also the managing director of Labor India Publications, which brings out textbook supplements.

 Does he fear for his safety? No, says the father of two. Because theres no significant heat build-up during re-entry, these spacecraft are effectively immune from accidents.

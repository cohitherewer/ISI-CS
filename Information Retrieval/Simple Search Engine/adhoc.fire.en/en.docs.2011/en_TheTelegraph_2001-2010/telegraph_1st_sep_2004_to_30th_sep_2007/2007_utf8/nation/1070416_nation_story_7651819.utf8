 Call to open temple doors to Yesudas

 JOHN MARY

 Yesudas 

 Thiruvananthapuram, April 15: A Marxist minister in Kerala has revived the controversy over barring singer K.J. Yesudas from entering the Sri Krishna temple at Guruvayur by demanding he should be allowed in.

 Cooperation and temple affairs minister G. Sudhakaran today vowed to write to the Guruvayur temple board to allow the singer entry to the historical shrine, traditionally out of bounds for non-Hindus.

 The minister, an atheist, felt it was a disgrace to keep out a well-known devotee whose soulful invocations are played at temples every morning, waking up the deity.

 Yesudas, born on January 10, 1940, in the old harbour town of Fort Kochi, was baptised at a Catholic church.

 The singer was not available on the phone as he was busy at a programme in north Kerala celebrating Vishu, the New Years Day for Malayalis.

 But his position on the question is well known. Ive not much regret, of late, for not being allowed to worship at the temple. I can fully imbibe him (the Lord) outside the four walls of the temple. Its better to invoke the Lord from the outside than be in, in the company of elements full of gall and venom.

 The most painful episode for Yesudas perhaps happened decades ago when the Guruvayur temple authorities stopped him at the gate but let in the rest of a concert troupe led by his guru the late Carnatic maestro, Chembai Vaidynatha Bhagavathar.

 When the guru walked out, his heart melted at the sight of Yesudas standing in the dark, in tears. The guru then led the disciple to an impromptu venue outside the temple and held a night-long concert in praise of Lord Krishna.

 Guruvayur temple board chairman Thottathil Ravindran, a CPM leader, said: The issue is sensitive since temple affairs are tradition-bound. The board will meet after we get the ministers communication. The opinion of the main priest will be crucial.

 Former board chairman K.V. Nambiar said: I dont think anyone will have an objection in the case of Yesudas, a well-known devotee. There will be far-reaching implications if the temple opens its doors to a non-Hindu.

 Tantri Chennas P.C. Raman Namboodiripad, who was attending a temple function, is also against breaking traditions to accommodate Yesudas since it will mark a departure from centuries-old customs.

 Students dead in Texas pool

 Kingsville, Texas, May 7 (AP): Two 23-year-old students from India were found dead in the swimming pool of an apartment complex in Texas, police said. 

 Witnesses said the two had been drinking the night before.

 Police sources said they were students at Texas A amp;M University, Kingsville, but declined to release their names pending notification of relatives.

 Its very hard; we cant even digest it, fellow student Rama Krishna, also 23, told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times newspaper. Weve lost friends.

 A caller reported that the victims were unresponsive when their bodies were pulled out of the pool late on Sunday morning, the police said.

 Police chief Ricardo Torres said the cause of the deaths had not been determined. There was no physical evidence that the victims had been assaulted, but witnesses said the victims had been drinking alcohol the night before, he added.

 We will be checking with the medical examiner to verify that there was no assault involved, Torres said.

 He said the police were working with the universitys student affairs office to locate and notify the victims families.

 Krishna said there are more than 400 Indian students at the 6,200-student university.

 Kingsville, a town of about 25,000 residents, is 140 miles south of San Antonio.

 Torres said the autopsy reports might take as long as three months to be completed. 

 The university has held a meeting to inform international students of the incident and to tell them that counselling was available on campus. 

 Basically, it is just a time for them to come together and support one another and also let them know that they should not be worried or fearful, said university spokeswoman Jill Scoggins.

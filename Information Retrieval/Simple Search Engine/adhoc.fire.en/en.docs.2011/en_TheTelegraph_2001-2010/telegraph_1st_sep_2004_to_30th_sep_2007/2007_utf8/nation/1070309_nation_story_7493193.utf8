 Net piracy arrest in Delhi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 8: Delhi police today claimed it had arrested a member of a gang running a piracy racket. 

 Tarun Kumar Gupta, 26, was arrested from his shop in north Delhis Fatehpuri locality this evening, the police said. 

 We hope he will lead us to other members of his group. He is not the kingpin, north Delhi deputy commissioner of police Devesh Srivastava said.

 Gupta and his group would download Hindi film songs and movie clips available online, using high capacity pen drives. The songs and clips would then be converted into CDs, the police suspect. The songs and clips could also be copied onto mobile phones with USB ports, needed for compatibility with pen drives.

 On the basis of initial interaction, he seems to be well versed with computer technology, Srivastava said. 

 The police, Srivastava said, had been trying to track Gupta down for the past few months.

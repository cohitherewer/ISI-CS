The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Thank judge, KBCs in Pak

 - Indian channels to deflect glare on CJ sack

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 Will the general 

 get to see Khan? 

 New Delhi, April 11: Tulsi Virani will soon be back in Pakistani drawing rooms. So would the new Kaun Banega Crorepati.

 And if they want to say thank you, they can to the recent anti-Musharraf agitation over the sacking of former Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry.

 As the media publicity given to the protests refused to die out, the Pakistan government did the next best thing: about two weeks ago, it quietly gave cable operators the permission to broadcast eight Indian entertainment channels.

 The green light means the saas-bahu serials and the new Shah Rukh Khan-anchored KBC will soon be back on Pakistani TV sets, 15 months after they were thrown out on charges of cultural invasion.

 The idea was to distract attention from the images of lawyers protesting and marching in the streets, broadcast through the day, again and again.

 When police in Islamabad walked into the offices of the privately run Geo TV the President has since apologised for the incident and some low-level policemen have been arrested Pakistans largely free press was hugely critical of the government.

 Pervez Musharrafs authority was being openly challenged like never before, but the government was not going to give in. So it set about knocking the bottom out of the media hype over the agitation.

 Information secretary Anwar Mehmood, said to be an ace administrator who ran the ministry for five years before being moved to health but is now back, is said to be the architect of the new glasnost.

 Mehmood is believed to have suggested that if private television channels didnt move away from the anti-Musharraf news, the next best thing would be to distract attention. And the only way that could happen was to allow Indian entertainment channels to be shown again.

 Talat Hussain, director (news) of the private television network Aaj, was, however, openly critical of his governments move to relax the ban on Indian channels like STAR Plus, Sahara and Sony.

 In a live comment about a couple of weeks ago, Hussain said what the Pakistani government was doing amounted to cutting its nose to spite its face. He said the move to allow Indian entertainment channels to be broadcast was in direct response to the decision by private Pakistani channels to stay with the news in the aftermath of Justice Chaudhrys dismissal.

 While Indian news and current affairs channels are banned in Pakistan, entertainment networks were a huge draw until December 2005, when the cricket board complained to national regulator Pemra that local channels were picking up feeds from other networks instead of Ten Sports, which had an exclusive arrangement to broadcast in Pakistan.

 A number of foreign channels were banned at the time, including all Indian entertainment networks. But the real reason, according to some commentators, was the fear of being swamped by Indian culture.

 Clearly, that isnt such a threat any more.

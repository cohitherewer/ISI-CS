The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Where cows amp; cars jostle for space

 - New India see-saws with old

 Fifteen years on, little has changed

 Reuters correspondent Alistair Scrutton describes his experience in India

 Down by the customs house, past an unpaved road and the cows munching at piles of rubbish, the booming new India unceremoniously stopped in its tracks.

 I need to see one box, the one with a globe, the customs agent ordered.

 He pointed at the 300 family boxes that had survived a month-long odyssey on trucks, by sea and over Indian railways but now faced a worse obstacle bureaucracy.

 Ignoring other boxes filled from two years of living in the US, the agent decided the biggest danger to Indian security was my sons toy globe.

 Some globes we destroy. Bad ones. Some maps bad. You know, Kashmir in Pakistan, he said, pointing to a stack of broken globes in a warehouse corner that had defied Indian law by showing part of a disputed Kashmir within Pakistan.

 Welcome to India, where first impressions are of a nation that see-saws between an emerging Asian giant and a country that has perfected the British colonial technique of squashing independent spirit with a heavy dose of red tape.

 These days you cannot help but arrive in India half-expecting to see gleaming offices filled with IT workers undercutting their western counterparts, highways with imported cars and young people shunning tradition for hip urban trends.

 It all exists from the financial hub of Mumbai to the hi-tech city of Bangalore and the suburbs of Delhi where gated communities with names like Suncity Heights and Richmond Park are springing up.

 The number of aspiring middle- class Indians who can afford a refrigerator or TV is roughly equivalent to the entire population of the US, now at 300 million.

 But if first impressions count, then the India of old, with its one billion-plus inhabitants, may prove resilient.You wonder what Americans are worried about, said an American aid worker in a grocery store. He had just passed through three store workers: one who picked products off shelves, one at the cash register and one who carried bags to his car. What country has more to fear from globalisation? The US or the country that needs three people to sell you some soap?

 New Delhi has changed little since I came here briefly in 1992 at the start of the boom, at least on the surface. The bureaucracy, rickshaws and poverty are all still there. There are now, of course, cellphones everywhere. An army of technicians arrives at your house to set up a wireless broadband.

 Some globalisation effects are subtle. Our community centre has Latin salsa lessons. Many Hindu deity statues sold in markets are made in China.

 Street hawkers these days sell copies of the prospectuses for the latest company flotations on the stock exchange for Rs 5 as popular capitalism takes root.

 Delhi has a new subway and buses run on eco-friendly natural gas.

 But the India of ancient cities and Mughal tombs, its crowds and religious faith surfaces no matter the flyovers and offices.

 A week into my assignment I travelled to the Ardh Kumbh Mela, one of the worlds biggest gatherings of humanity when millions of Hindus descend on the sacred Ganga to wash away their sins.

 First there was New Delhi airport terminal, with its one coffee stall, a broken newspaper dispenser and passengers who did not appear to know the word queue. Then came a four-hour car trip through villages with women in colourful saris.

 At sunset I walked through dust to the banks of the Ganga. The simplicity of the Hindu bathing ritual and its proximity to natures eternal rhythms inspired even this agnostic foreigner. 

 I bought a paper boat with a candle and launched it onto the Ganga as a blessing for close ones.

 The boat drifted in the current. New India, for now, faded away.

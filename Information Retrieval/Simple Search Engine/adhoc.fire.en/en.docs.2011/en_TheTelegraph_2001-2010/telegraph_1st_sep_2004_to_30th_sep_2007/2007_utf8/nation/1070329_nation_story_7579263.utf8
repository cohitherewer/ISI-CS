 Kathmandu, March 28: An interim government in Nepal that will include the Maoists is likely to be sworn in on Friday. Nepali Congress president and caretaker Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala will lead the government. 

 Koirala told The Telegraph this morning in an informal chat that he was doing his best to form the government before going to New Delhi for the Saarc summit on Sunday. Pressure is mounting on him from several quarters. 

 Maoist MPs did not let the interim Parliament function today, forcing it to adjourn. They demanded that an interim government be formed without further delay so that constituent assembly elections could be held in time. 

 Earlier, the Maoists had set a Friday deadline for government formation before launching a mass agitation. 

 It is understood that New Delhi was also keen that Koirala come for the Saarc summit after swearing in a new government. This was perhaps to stave off criticism of a hidden Indian hand in government formation subsequently. 

 These factors combined are encouraging political compromises of various kinds. While Koirala was keen that there be no deputy Prime Minister in the interim government, he is now considering a proposal to have three deputy Prime Ministers if that facilitates government formation. 

 The proposal envisages a senior deputy Prime Minister from Koiralas party, the Nepali Congress, and one deputy Prime Minister each from the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) or UML. 

 If the proposal is accepted, the Nepali Congress is likely to nominate either Sushil Koirala or Ramchandra Paudel for the post of senior deputy Prime Minister. 

 The Maoist candidate will be Krishna Bahadur Mahara. It is still unclear whether the UML will continue with the present incumbent and foreign minister K.P. Sharma Oli or nominate someone else. Oli has to attend the Saarc summit and it would be difficult to recall him from the cabinet before the event. 

 Further flexibility may be allowed to the eight-party alliance including the Maoists that would help form the interim government. 

 A proposal has been floated by the UML that the alliance partners be allowed to nominate a junior minister each to the council of ministers. 

 This would be in addition to the agreed share of each party in the new cabinet five cabinet berths each for the Nepali Congress, UML and the Maoists, three for the Nepali Congress (Democratic) of Sherbahadur Deuba, one each for the Jan Morcha, the Nepal Sadbhavna Party of Anandi Devi, and the United Left Front. 

 The Nepal Mazdoor Kisan Party, although a member of the eight-party alliance, does not want a cabinet berth while supporting the government. 

 Koiralas proposal that a small cabinet with one representative from each party be sworn in immediately with cabinet expansion after the Saarc summit has been rejected by the Maoists. 

 Although widely respected, his partners consider Koirala wily. He trades in promises, said one of his critics, hinting that the Prime Minister might play around with portfolio distribution later if his proposal for a small government is accepted now.

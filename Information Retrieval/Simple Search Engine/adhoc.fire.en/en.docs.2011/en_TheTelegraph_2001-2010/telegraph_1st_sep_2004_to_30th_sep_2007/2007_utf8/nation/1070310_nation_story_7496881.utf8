 Sponsor quits Big Brother

 London, March 9 (PTI): Leading British mobile phone company Carphone Warehouse has terminated its 3-million annual deal with Channel 4 to sponsor the Big Brother TV series, two months after a racism row targeting Shilpa Shetty engulfed the reality show.

 The company pulled its branding from the show halfway through the series as the controversy grew over the allegedly racist treatment of the actress, who emerged the winner. 

 We constantly review our sponsorship relationships and feel that having suspended the sponsorship during this years Celebrity Big Brother, now is a good time to look at that partnership again, the group said in a statement. 

 We have concluded that the huge publicity around the show and our involvement within that means that now is the time for us to look for an alternative, it said. 

 The company had been sponsoring the show and its celebrity spin-off since 2003.

 Shilpa became a household name in Britain after enduring racist bullying by housemates Jade Goody, Jo Meara and Danielle Lloyd.

 Himesh plotters give away trigger twins

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Himesh: Close shave 

 Lucknow, July 26: Four alleged plotters arrested yesterday have spilled the names of the men hired to shoot Himesh Reshammiya and Rajkumar Santoshi, police said today.

 Mohammad Imran and Suhail Khan, two youngsters from Thane with a relatively clean image, were contracted in the first week of July by the Ejaz Lakdawala gang of extortion mobsters and offered Rs 50,000 each to pull the trigger, they claimed. 

 The deadline for the murders was August 15.

 We have now more or less unearthed the whole plot although we are yet to learn the name of the singer being promoted by Lakdawala for entry in Sa Re Ga Ma, said Shailaja Kant Mishra, the additional director-general of police in charge of the special task force. 

 The police had said yesterday that Himesh, a judge on the Zee talent show, had angered Lakdawala by refusing to back a contestant. This, and refusal to pay protection money, were cited as the reason the singer was on the hit list. Filmmaker Santoshi was also reported to have rebuffed extortion demands.

 An attempt to kill Himesh in the office of a television channel was aborted in February when the singer did not turn up as scheduled, investigators said.

 Anis Radiowala, the leader of the four men arrested near Lucknow with weapons allegedly to be used in the crime, had spilled the address of the Thane youths, which was being verified by the police.

 A dossier on the six suspects will be sent to Mumbai police, who had tipped off their Uttar Pradesh counterparts about the presence of the four in the state.

 We know very little about the singer (Lakdawala was trying to promote) as Anis failed to recall his name. An effort to establish his identity could be best done by Mumbai police, Mishra said. 

 We have not approached Zee TV but the statements of all the four have been recorded for Mumbai police to follow up. All the four accused were produced today before a Lucknow court, which remanded them in judicial custody. 

 A gutkha king with an office in Kanpur was the businessman the four were planning to abduct for ransom before they returned to Mumbai with the weapons, the investigators said.

 Lakdawala, once part of the Dawood Ibrahim gang, now operates on his own out of Australia and New Zealand.

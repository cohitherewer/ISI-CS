 New Delhi, Feb. 1 (PTI): The revised guidelines aimed at reducing delays in issuing passports came into effect today. 

 Only new and revised forms would be accepted. The new forms do not need police verification in case of re-issue. An applicant for a new passport will have to furnish only three out of 14 documents, including one with a photograph. 

 New Delhi (PTI): A bank official has told a court trying the Nitish Katara murder case that Rs 10,000 was sent from Nitishs bank account to that of key witness Bharti Yadavs. The statement strengthens the argument that the two had an intimate relationship which Bharti has denied.

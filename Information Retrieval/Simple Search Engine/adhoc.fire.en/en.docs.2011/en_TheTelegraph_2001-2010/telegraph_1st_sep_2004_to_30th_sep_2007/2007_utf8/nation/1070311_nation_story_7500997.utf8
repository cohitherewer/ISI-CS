 Minority front for UP polls

 DHIRENDRA K. JHA

 New Delhi, March 10: Muslim religious organisations in Uttar Pradesh have brought together on a common platform seven political outfits of the community to prevent a split in minority votes in the coming state elections.

 The organisations, which formed a core group about two months ago, would soon release a charter of demands to be called Peoples Manifesto on behalf of the seven parties.

 Once the Peoples Manifesto is ready, we will start negotiations with secular parties and fronts. We will seek not only a commitment on our charter of demands but also some seats which would be contested by candidates belonging to seven Muslim parties we have brought under one umbrella, core group coordinator Mujtaba Farooq said. 

 All the religious organisations would campaign for the secular front or party that would accept our demands.

 The outfits the organisations have brought together are the National Loktantrik Party, Indian National League, Muslim Majlis, Momin Conference, Peoples Democratic Forum, Parcham Party and the Muslim Muttahida Mahaz.

 Among the major religious bodies that have taken the initiative are the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, the Deoband and the Barelvi schools, Tablig-e-Jamiat and the Jamiat-ul-Ahle Hadis.

 Although the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind is not formally part of the core group as its general secretary is a Rashtriya Lok Dal MP, many of its supporters are followers of the Deoband school, said Farooq.

 The emerging Congress-Jan Morcha-RLD front appears to be the groups choice. Experience shows that neither the BSP nor the Samajwadi Party can be trusted completely as both are capable of tying the knot with the BJP, he said.

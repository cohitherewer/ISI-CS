 Chandigarh, May 18: A saddened and sleepless Parkash Singh Badal today condemned the despicable depiction of Guru Gobind Singh in a Dera Sacha Sauda advertisement.

 The chief minister described the ad that ignited violence across Punjab as the biggest ever provocation for people in the state.

 We are saddened by the turn of events. What has happened should have been avoided. But it was a big provocation for the people of all religions and faiths, Badal said, adding that he had not slept since yesterday.

 The chief ministers statement came on a day Punjab got a breather from the violence that left one person dead and several injured.

 Unwilling to risk a repeat of the flare-up, Badal played his cards with caution. 

 He condemned the Dera, but there was no word on the Sikh high priests demand for a social boycott of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who sparked the controversy. 

 District officers are holding meetings with members of all communities to ensure the situation remains under control, Badal said.

 Like the others, even I have gone to the Dera to seek support. It is normal for all parties and politicians. But I never thought they could indulge in a blasphemous act as despicable as denigrating a revered guru. 

 Badal also refrained from blaming any political party. In fact, he praised Congress workers for lending a hand to the Shiromani Akali Dal government in restoring peace.

 He said 20 parties of paramilitary forces have reached sensitive places in Bhatinda, Amritsar and Patiala. Sixteen more are slated to arrive.

 Asked about Gurmeets offer of a dialogue with Sikh religious bodies and his government, Badal said he had not received any such invitation. The government cannot interfere in a dispute between religious sects, but it will do its best to ensure that law and order prevails.

 The chief minister urged the media to exercise restraint. Small processions are being turned into major upheavals and fears of a revival of terrorism, he said.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh advised the Punjab government to maintain utmost vigil to ensure peace. I sincerely hope nothing will be done to flare up tempers, and the situation in Punjab will be brought under control, he said.

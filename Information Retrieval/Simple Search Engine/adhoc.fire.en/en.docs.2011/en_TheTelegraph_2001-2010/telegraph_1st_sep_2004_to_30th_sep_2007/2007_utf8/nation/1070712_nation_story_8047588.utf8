 Haneef tells wife hes fine

 Haneef

 Bangalore, July 11: Mohammed Haneef spoke to his wife back home for the first time since his detention in Australia to say he is fine but the Indian doctor will have to remain in custody for two more days.

 A Brisbane magistrate today allowed police to hold Haneef without charge till Friday, raising concerns among rights groups and lawyers.

 Its quite an extraordinary period of detention, senator Kerry Nettle said while his Greens party called for Haneef, held since July 2 over the failed car bomb attacks in the UK, to be charged or released.

 Haneefs one-minute call ended a nine-day wait for his family who had been trying to get through to him. His wife Firdous, who recently gave birth to a girl, said he didnt say much except that he was in good health. Main theek hoon, he told her in Urdu. All is well.

 Firdous said he asked her to take care of the baby and to tell his mother he would be back home soon. Though close to tears, she said she didnt ask him when he would be allowed to call next.

 Haneefs lawyer Peter Russo said he was fairly elated that he got to make the call.

 In Bangalore, the doctors younger brother Shoaib said they felt a little better that a family member had finally been able to speak to him.

 He said the Indian High Commission in Canberra has hired Russo, but foreign ministry officials in Delhi denied the claim.

 Shoaib, a final year engineering student who missed his exams last week, said the family was worried how they will fight the case overseas. We know he is innocent, but in case he is charged, we dont know where to turn to as lawyers abroad are very expensive.

 Shoaib said his brother was the familys sole breadwinner. The only other income comes from our house which we have rented out in Mudigere (near Chikmagalur). My mother gets a paltry Rs 2,000 a month from it.

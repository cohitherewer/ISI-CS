 Delhi culture centre in membership row

 New Delhi, Aug. 5 (PTI): The India International Centre has told Delhi High Court it is not a public body after a petition was filed challenging its membership rules. 

 Petitioner Rajesh Mehta approached the court in November last year after his application for membership was rejected. He complained that the selection process was a closed-door affair akin to a state secret and demanded transparency.

 The IIC is not a state within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution , the culture centre said in reply to a notice issued in March. The IIC is not a statutory body. It does not perform public function nor discharge a public or statutory duty.

 Its functions are not similar to those performed by the state in its sovereign capacity, the centre added.

 Mehta was denied membership purely because of limited vacancies, infrastructure and facilities, it said. 

 He was one of 6,000 people who had applied when the centre invited applications in October 2005 after a gap of more than 12 years. Of them, 624 were selected.

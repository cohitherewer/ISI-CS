 New Delhi, Feb. 1: For possibly the first time in his life, model-turned-actor Shayan Munshi has been given the chance to pen his own script.

 Calcutta-born Shayan was today given two weeks by Delhi High Court to explain in written format the dramatic changes in his statements in the Jessica Lal murder case.

 The struggling Bollywood actor has started well. He was the first among the 29 hostile witnesses in the case to reach the court today, and appeared to have left a positive impression on the judges. 

 It is good to see that you respect the court, said Justice R.S. Sodhi who, along with Justice P.K. Bhasin, had sentenced Manu Sharma, the main accused, to jail for life.

 The words may have come as a surprise, but Shayan didnt show it. Sodhi had labelled him a liar while delivering the verdict on Manu.

 Andaleeb Sehgal, accused in the Iraq oil-for-food scam and another hostile witness in the case, reached the court just in time. Other witnesses, including cricketer Yuvraj Singhs father Yograj Singh, were there before him. 

 Police believe Yograj knew Manus father, former Union minister Venod Sharma, and helped them destroy evidence. 

 The court issued non-bailable warrants against three witnesses Varun Shah, Mukesh Saini and Narayan Singh who failed to show up. 

 Justice Sodhi also made it clear that any further legal action against Shayan and the other hostile witnesses would depend on their written replies. If you cant give me satisfactory replies... replies which explain the criminal turnaround, you will face action, Sodhi said. 

 Shayan seemed relieved as he left court. I was tense in the morning, but now I plan to relax, sit down with my lawyers and then prepare the reply, he said. In his police statement on the night Jessica was shot dead at south Delhis Tamarind Court, Shayan had said he had seen Manu shoot with his gun, once in the air, and then at Jessica.

 Shayan, who was serving drinks with Jessica at the bar, was considered the most crucial witness till he retracted his statement in court. The police statement, Shayan had told a trial court, was in Hindi, a language he claimed he didnt understand.

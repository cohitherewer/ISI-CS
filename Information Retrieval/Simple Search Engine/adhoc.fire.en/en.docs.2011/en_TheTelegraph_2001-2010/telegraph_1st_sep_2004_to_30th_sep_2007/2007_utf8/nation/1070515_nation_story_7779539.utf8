 Phone glare on schools

 Thiruvananthapuram, May 14 (PTI): The Kerala government will consult a legal expert to decide whether restrictions on cellphone use should be imposed in schools, education minister M.A. Baby has said. 

 We have to seek the opinion of legal experts to know how the government can impose such a restriction, Baby said today. 

 His ministry, in a bid to create environmental awareness among students, has planned a programme called My Tree Day.

 On June 5, nearly 15 lakh children will be asked to plant a sapling each in their schools or any other place identified under the programme and nurse the sapling, Baby said.

 Grenade blast kills IMA cadet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 9: A cadet was killed in the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehra Dun during a drill to throw hand grenades this afternoon.

 Gentleman Cadet B.K. Tiwari of Hazaribagh in Jharkhand was one of a group of cadets being trained to throw hand grenades. The grenade he had exploded on him. 

 The exact circumstances are being investigated. It was not known if the grenade was defective or if the cadet had taken out the pin (making it ready for explosion) and held the grenade too long before hurling it at the target.

 The army spokesman in New Delhi, Colonel S.K. Sakhuja, said the grenade exploded during practice firing around 1.25pm.

 A court of inquiry has been ordered. The IMA trains cadets who go on to become permanent commission officers in the armed forces, starting with the rank of lieutenant. (Short service commission officers graduate from the Officers Training Academy in Chennai). 

 IMA cadets may have graduated from the National Defence Academy or may be direct entrants. 

 They are trained in the IMA for at least a year one-and-a-half years for direct entrants before they are commissioned as officers in the army.

 In October last year, a cadet, Devendra Kumar from Solan in Himachal Pradesh, committed suicide.

 NDAs President plot goes awry

 Kalam: Out of race

 New Delhi, June 22: The BJP-led NDA suffered loss of face thrice over today: A.P.J. Abdul Kalam backed out of the presidential race, the third front seemed disinclined to support Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and then it had to explain the slander on Pratibha Patil.

 Spokesperson Sushma Swaraj, fielded for a tough assignment, said their fight with the UPAs presidential nominee was political and ideological, not personal. 

 As the spokesperson, I state with complete responsibility that so long as the campaign is on until July 19, I will not make a personal allegation or speak loosely against Pratibha Patil, she said.

 The BJP has ordered an internal probe into how and why the residence of Akali Dal MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa was used to present Rajini Patil before the media in his absence and reportedly without his knowledge. Rajini accused Pratibhas brother of murder at the news conference.

 It was pointed out that Dhindsa, who is away in Shimla, had told TV journalists that Tarlochan Singh and an editor, who are both Rajya Sabha MPs thought to be close to the BJP, had asked for the use of his house. Also, that Sudheendra Kulkarni, L.K. Advanis former political secretary, was present at the news conference.

 Swaraj distanced the BJP from the MPs, pointing out that they were nominated members and claiming that they had nothing to do with the party.

 On Kulkarni, Swaraj said she had asked the BJPs media cell convener, Nalin S. Kohli, to speak to him. Kulkarni told Nalin that he had nothing to do with it, directly or indirectly.

 When TV journalists said at least half-a-dozen of them saw Kulkarni, she snapped: I am not his spokesperson. Im accountable to the NDA. 

 The BJP leader rejected a suggestion that Shekhawats supporters may have been behind it. Shekhawatjis stature is so high that he cant think of doing something as low as this. Shekhawat is contesting for President as an Independent supported by the NDA. 

 BJP sources spoke of how disturbed their senior leaders Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Advani and Jaswant Singh were on hearing of the news conference. Rajini should have opted for a neutral venue to articulate her charges and not used a political party, they said.

 This evening, when the third front leaders called on the BJP leaders at Vajpayees residence, Jayalalithaa said Kalam appeared wounded by the attack mounted on him by some UPA ministers. 

 The NDA leaders solicited the third fronts votes for Shekhawat. Jayalalithaa said the front would discuss the matter and get back to the BJP.

 Kalam refusal

 Kalams refusal to contest has left the third front leaders struggling to keep the newly formed group United National Progressive Alliance united. 

 Serious differences of opinion have cropped up among constituents. While one section, including Jayalalitha and Om Prakash Chautala, is in favour of backing Shekhawat, the Samajwadi Party and the Telugu Desam are taking extra care not to appear too close to the BJP. 

 Unity of the front is our main concern now, a senior leader said.

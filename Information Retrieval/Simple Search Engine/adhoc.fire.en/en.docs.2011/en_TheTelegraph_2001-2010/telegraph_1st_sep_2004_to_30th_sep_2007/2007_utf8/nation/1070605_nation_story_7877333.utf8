 SC bail ruling

 New Delhi, June 4 (PTI): Anticipatory bail should not be granted to anyone as a matter of right or routine, the Supreme Court has said, making it clear that the provision is not meant for rapists and murderers. The bench clarified that Section 438 CRPC was never meant for rapists, triple murderers and persons with serious charges, while declining to grant anticipatory bail to an accused charged with financial laundering.

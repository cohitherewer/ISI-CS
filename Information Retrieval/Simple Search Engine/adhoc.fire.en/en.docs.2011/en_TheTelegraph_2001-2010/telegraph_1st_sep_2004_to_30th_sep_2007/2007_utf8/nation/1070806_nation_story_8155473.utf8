 Pune, Aug. 5: Sanjay Dutt might have taken a forced break from the film industry, but when he gets out of jail he will still be able to say he was part of an industry whose annual turnover runs into crores.

 The Yerwada jail industry boasts of a bottomline that convicts can write home about. Its annual turnover is more than Rs 5 crore, with several small-scale industries operating on the premises.

 About 400 convicts who have proved their dependability through their good behaviour have been employed in the various workshops. Some, who are not skilled enough, are trained to be part of the industries.

 We have over 400 convicts working here. They are mostly from the open jail situated in the back of the premises. These convicts are well-behaved and can be allowed to work outside in showrooms and farms, run by the jail. They are divided into three categories skilled, unskilled and semi-skilled. We give them work accordingly, said Dilip Wasnik, the senior jailer and factory manager.

 The skilled workmen are paid Rs 25.50 a day, depending on their skill, while the semi-skilled get Rs 17.

 Sanjay, who demands crores for a film, will be paid Rs 12.75 a day in jail because he falls in the category of the unskilled.

 His position is uncertain, given the fact that the actor has to undergo a medical test to see if he is capable of withstanding hard labour. 

 The jail authorities also need to be sure that Sanjay is here to stay for a considerable period before they decide to train him. There are also security concerns that might not allow him to take on any productive work in the industries and he may be relegated to canteen work or work in the kitchen.

 Sanjay or any prisoner who comes here is assigned work by the super. He might assign work according to the wishes of the convict or give him some work that he finds him suitable for, said Wasnik.

In 2006-07, the jail managed to rake up Rs 5.5 crore (approximately), almost 50 lakh more than the previous years figure of Rs 5 crore.

 The in-house prison industry that supports the jail is called Udyog Karagruha. More than 70 products are churned out by the chosen prisoners terracotta, cloth, saris, bed sheets, hospital-related cloth products, painted bed sheets, stitched uniforms for schools, police and home guards, wooden furniture, notebooks, files, metal racks and furniture, baking bread, biscuits and other bakery products.

 The Jail Industries Maharashtra showroom, just minutes from the prison, displays an array of goods one can choose from. The convicts also run a laundry service from the premises. 

 All government departments, schools and the Pune Municipal Transport are clients of the jail industry.

 Once these departments submit their requirements, the goods are supplied. The public, too, can take home furniture and other goods, though sale is on a small scale.

 The convicts who work in these departments try to give their best as they are suitably rewarded they can be given parole for seven days or can be promoted to night watchmen or convict overseers. Also, when they finally leave, they are trained enough to be employed.

 The media blitzkrieg has spurred on a part of the jails small-scale industry across the road is a small eatery that serves hot vegetable pakodas, vada paos and tea. 

 To the endlessly waiting journalists, this stall, run by convicts, is a treat from heaven.

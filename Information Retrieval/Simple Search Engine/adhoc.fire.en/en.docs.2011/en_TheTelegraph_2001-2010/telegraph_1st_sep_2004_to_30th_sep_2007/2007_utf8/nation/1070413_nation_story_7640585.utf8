 Lesson for Cong in Sena victory

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Mumbai, April 12: The Shiv Sena today won the Ramtek Lok Sabha byelection and claimed it as proof that the party is bigger than individuals.

 The Vidarbha seat had fallen vacant when Sena MP Subodh Mohite followed his mentor Narayan Rane into the Congress. Contesting as a Congress candidate, four-time winner Mohite lost to Prakash Jadhav by 32,571 votes.

 The Sena, having earlier retained the Mumbai civic body despite a split, grabbed the chance to crow that its voters are committed to the partys principles and not candidates personal appeal.

 Sena working president Uddhav Thackeray said the win at Ramtek, once P.V. Narasimha Raos constituency, was a victory of principled politics over the politics of betrayal. The BJP-Sena also retained Jalgaon, vacated by the BJPs Y.G. Mahajan who was expelled over the cash-for-queries scandal. The only good news for the ruling alliance not the Congress, though was that the NCP wrested Erandol from the BJP. 

 The Congress was left mulling over the lessons of the defeats. Many in the party have been arguing that in the long term, the Congress would gain little from the Sena imports.

 For instance, Ranes entry had been opposed by the late MP, Sunil Dutt, and later by his daughter Priya Dutt. They felt that the Sena defectors extremist and destructive politics would alienate the Congresss Muslim and secular constituencies in Mumbai.

 Even when Rane helped revive the Congresss fortunes along the Konkan coast, his turf, many argued that this would be nullified by more serious losses elsewhere. There are limits to the politics of expediency and pragmatism, a functionary today said.

 Rane had spirited Mohite away from the Sena to prove his utility to the Congress and cock a snook at Bal Thackeray. But questions were raised when the high command fielded the newcomer and gave loyalist Ranjit Deshmukh the short shrift. Deshmukh, who had headed the state Congress for two terms, quit and contested as an Independent.

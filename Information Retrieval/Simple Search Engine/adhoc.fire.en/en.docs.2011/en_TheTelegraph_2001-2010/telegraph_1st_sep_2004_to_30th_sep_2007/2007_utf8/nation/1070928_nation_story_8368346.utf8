The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Buddha on US

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 27: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today attacked the Centres strategic partnerships with the US on the eve of the CPM politburo and central committee meetings here to discuss Left-UPA relations following the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 Without mentioning the nuclear deal, the Bengal chief minister said: We have asked the government in Delhi not to go ahead with the strategic alliance with the US.

 He added: The whole country and most of the political parties are opposing an alliance with the US. Why did the government go in for joint naval exercises with the US and its allies?

 The chief minister, who was addressing a rally of CPM students wing SFI, however, seemed to be alluding to the nuclear deal when he said: One cannot become rich by begging. The country has to grow on its own strength.

 Supporters of the deal have argued that it would enhance the countrys global standing.

 The chief ministers comments could be aimed at addressing perceptions that the Bengal CPM and the central leadership are at odds on the nuclear deal. Besides, he could have said little else at todays platform the SFI, which thrives on slogans like anti-imperialism. Last week, at a CII event, he had said nuclear energy was unavoidable.

 Bhattacharjee also asked the SFI to convince students about the need for industrialisation.

 Lathis, then rape: women point finger at cops 

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Nandigram, March 16: Two victims of the police action in Nandigram, now recovering from lathicharge injuries in hospital, today alleged they were raped by policemen after they fell to their blows.

 No medical exam has yet been conducted on them as the Nandigram hospital authorities insist they need a magistrates order to do it. No police case has been registered either as the victims did not complain at the time of admission.

 A 25-year-old resident of Gokulnagar village, admitted with injuries on the head and hips, was the first to break her silence.

 As the lathicharge began, I was first hit on the head. The second blow came on the hips, after which I fell down. In the melee, three policemen carried me to an abandoned house nearby. There, two of them raped me while the third stood guard at the door. I lost consciousness. When I recovered, I was in hospital. 

 The mother of three said she was the only one from her family to have participated in the procession on Wednesday as her husband was away in Hooghly.

 It was her brother-in-law Joydeb Pradhan who admitted her to hospital.

 We found her lying unconscious in an abandoned house. She was admitted on Wednesday evening, but regained consciousness only later that night, said Pradhan. 

 The other victim, a 27-year-old from Kalicharanpur, is a little hazy about the trauma because she passed out in the middle of it. The only reminder is the acute pain in her chest.

 I was trying to help my neighbour who had collapsed after a gun-shot injury. As I was bending over to drag him away, a policeman grabbed me and started raining blows on me. After I had taken about five blows on the chest and shoulders, I spotted another policeman coming towards me. Somehow I fled and hid inside a nearby cow shed, but the policemen followed me there and raped me. Sometime during the ordeal, I passed out, she said.

 She was admitted to hospital on Thursday evening by husband Bikas Majhi.

 I have trouble breathing. My chest hurts when I breathe, she said, showing the red welts on her chest. 

 Haripada Maity, Nandigram block medical officer, said: Weve referred them to Tamluk hospital for a medical test since we dont have necessary infrastructure.

 Tamluk hospital superintendent Sabitendra Patra said he had asked the Tamluk police station OC to get a magistrates order.

 Tamluk OC Subhankar Dey said the victims should have lodged their complaint with Nandigram police station. I was busy with the CBI team visit and am unaware of the incident.

 Nandigram OC Shekhar Roy said: If the two women want, they can lodge their complaints with Tamluk police station.

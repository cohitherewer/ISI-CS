 Doctors accused of shunning HIV boy 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 22: Seven-year-old Maniur Rehman desperately needs an operation but surgeons at leading state-run hospitals wouldnt touch him allegedly because he is HIV positive.

 The thalassaemic boy can consider himself a victim of the states health care system twice over he probably got infected during one of the regular blood transfusions he has needed for years.

 Now, his spleen has enlarged a complication of thalassaemia that experts said can be life-threatening. But for over a year, no hospital would admit him, his father says.

 Sheikh Idrish Ali, a daily labourer from Sandeshkhali in South 24-Parganas, says he has been doing the rounds of SSKM, Calcutta Medical College and Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College hospitals without success.

 The blood that Maniur needed came from Central Blood Bank, Maniktala, Idrish said. At first, he used to need a transfusion every two or three months, but after his spleen enlarged in 2005, that changed to five times a month.

 The doctor treating him advised splenectomy (removal of a part or whole of the spleen), and Idrish got him admitted to SSKMs paediatric ward on December 20, 2005. On December 29, the boy tested HIV positive.

 The doctor refused to do the operation and asked us to take him away, Idrish said. Maniur was discharged on January 3, 2006. Through the whole year, we tried to get him re-admitted, but in vain, the father said.

 He went to MCH where the medicine department examined Maniur on December 23, 2006, and referred him to the paediatric department for surgery. But the surgeons wouldnt operate on him. Ditto at NRS.

 Two voluntary organisations, People for Better Treatment (PBT) and Human Development Research Institute, offered help. PBT has asked the state government to provide treatment and compensation and plans to move court, its president Kunal Saha said.

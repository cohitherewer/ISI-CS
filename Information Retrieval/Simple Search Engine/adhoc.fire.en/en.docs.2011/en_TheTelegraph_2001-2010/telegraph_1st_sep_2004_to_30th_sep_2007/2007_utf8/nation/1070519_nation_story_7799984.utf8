 93 victim no longer cares

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 18: On March 12 in 1993, Yogita and Namrata Sorte had woken up to see the smiling faces of their parents, dressed for a visit to a friends home.

 That was the last time either saw their mother and father alive. As the anti-terror court today began sentencing all those involved in Indias biggest terror attack, Namrata said she didnt care.

 Do I care? No. Can the verdict change the fact that my child can never meet his grandparents? Can it change my sisters destiny? Can it give me back my childhood? No. Then why should I care? she said.

 More than justice, Namrata is looking for closure.

 Kanti Magdalena seemed already to have found closure, in a tragic way. Asked about the sentencing, she stared with a blank expression. The blasts had turned her deaf, her nephew said. Whats the use of asking her anything? 

 Kanti saw a double-decker bus in front of the regional passport office blown to shreds. None of the passengers survived, and she alone lives with the scars.

 Most of those around the blast sites were wary. Neither would they talk about their brush with death so many years ago, nor would they comment on the sentencing that they felt was long overdue.

 Why do you have to go on about the same things? You are asking about our trauma, but I feel its deepening with time. The case has gone on for ever. I lost so much money in the blasts, said Javesh Zaveri, who was left with deep wounds on his hands and legs when a bomb exploded in front of his jewellery store.

 The residents of Malkani Mahal, Rupa Sadan, Ramodaya Mansion and Majrekar Sadan were mostly at home when their lives were ripped apart. Most slammed the door on reporters today.

 Praveena Malkani was the only one in Malkani Mahal who would talk. My house was ruined. I dont know how I survived maybe because I was inside the bedroom. That day will haunt me till I die. Dont even ask me what I think of the sentencing.

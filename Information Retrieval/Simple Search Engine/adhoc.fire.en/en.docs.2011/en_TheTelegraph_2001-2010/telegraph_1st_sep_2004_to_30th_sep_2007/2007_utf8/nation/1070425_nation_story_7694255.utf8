 Scanner on Ganga crores 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 24: The Supreme Court today asked authorities concerned to give details on the expenditure of about Rs 1,000 crore in the first phase of the Ganga Action Plan aimed at cleaning the river or face prosecution.

 We will order prosecution if you dont produce (fund) utilisation certificate, a bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said. He fixed May 17 as the deadline. 

 The court had not received details of expenditure despite a direction to this effect in February.

 The details were sought after amicus curiae Kishan Mahajan, who is assisting the court in the matter, alleged that the quality of water in the river had not improved despite the government spending around Rs 1,000 crore in the first phase.

 Mahajan submitted that the 2006 CAG report had highlighted deterioration in the quality of water in the river. It stated that the environment ministry had discontinued the practise of monitoring the quality of water which was a necessary technical requirement, he said.

 The Centre, however, said the first phase had shown better results than other river cleaning drives in western countries. 

 The ministry cited a study, which pointed out that in terms of both the cost and the time taken, the Ganga Action Plan had shown better results than the cleaning drives on Thames, Rhine and Danube.

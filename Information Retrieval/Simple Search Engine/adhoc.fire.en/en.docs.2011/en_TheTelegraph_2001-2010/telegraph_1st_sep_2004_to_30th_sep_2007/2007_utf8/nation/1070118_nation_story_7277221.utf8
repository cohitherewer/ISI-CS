 More doctors for stressed-out forces

 Health relief

 New Delhi, Jan. 17: The stressed and bruised paramilitary forces are getting more doctors.

 The recruitment of 500 doctors, including 276 specialist surgeons, allowed by the Centre has begun. The last date for receiving applications is January 30.

 Also, the medical cadres of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Border Security Force (BSF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and the Assam Rifles have now been merged into one unit. It will be headed by an officer of the level of additional director general.

 The highest rank a doctor could have reached earlier was that of inspector general, and there was just one such post in each force. The reformulated structure has thrown open 11 IG-level and 35 DIG-level posts in the five forces. 

 All the vacancies, which include 276 specialist medical officers (SMO), 188 medical officers (MO) and 36 dentists, will be filled up directly through interviews by CRPFs service selection board, CRPF spokesperson Abhishek Dayal said.

 Specialist doctors (medicine, surgery, radiology and gynaecology) will go to composite hospitals (100 beds) and 50-bed hospitals, while the MOs will be required to work mainly in 20-bed group hospitals.

 The CRPF, the force most prone to casualties and injuries, will benefit the most with 155 specialist doctors and 44 MOs/dentists joining by the end of April. Last year, it lost 10 people in four shootouts and 30 committed suicide. 

 The BSF will get 68 SMOs and 35 MOs, SSB 21 SMOs and 31 MOs, ITBP 25 SMOs and 45 MOs and the Assam Rifles 7 SMOs and 69 MOs.

 It will be a great relief for our force, which is currently 100 per cent deployed with 62 battalions entrenched in Jammu and Kashmir, 45 in the Northeast, 31 in Naxalite-affected areas and rest in other sensitive postings, a senior CRPF official said.

 Paramilitary forces are hoping that high ranks and the perks that come with them will draw good doctors. On recruitment, SMOs (doctors with an MS or MD degree) will get the rank of the deputy commandant, which is equivalent to the superintendent of police, and MOs and dentists (MBBS and equivalent) will get the rank of assistant commandant, equivalent to deputy superintendent of police. 

 Quick and time-bound promotion is another factor that will attract perhaps the best possible medico talent to para-military forces. A medical officer will automatically go up to the post of the CMO, equivalent to full commandant or SSP in the IPS, Dayal said.

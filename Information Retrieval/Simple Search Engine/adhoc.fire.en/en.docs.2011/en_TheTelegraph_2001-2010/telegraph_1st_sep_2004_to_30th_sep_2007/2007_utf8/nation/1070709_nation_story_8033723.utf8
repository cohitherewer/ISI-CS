 Bangalore, July 8: A British police team is likely to arrive in Bangalore tomorrow for first-hand investigation in the hometown of three of the London and Glasgow terror suspects, city police sources said.

 The sleuths are expected to touch down in the morning. They will question the families of the accused Kafeel and Sabeel Ahmed and Mohammed Haneef and go through computer and phone records seized from the Ahmeds home, the sources said.

 The city police are believed to be questioning a close friend of Kafeel, the engineer who drove a car bomb into Glasgow airport on June 30 and is fighting for his life in a British hospital.

 Teams of officers have been formed to identify the associates of Kafeel and Sabeel a doctor who worked near Liverpool and whose detention was today extended by a week from the Ahmeds mobile and landline phone records.

 Officers are also trying to confirm if the brothers, whom they today linked to the Students Islamic Movement of India (Simi), had organised a Chechnya Day meeting in Bangalore three years ago.

 The police claim to have found a wealth of data in the hard disks and email and phone records they have seized from the Ahmed home. But its too early to say if they were linked to any terror group, a source said.

 But they certainly had joined Simi (accused of a hand in terror attacks such as the July 11 Mumbai train blasts) and were later influenced by the Tablighi Jamaat (a puritanical sect).

 There havent been any seizures from the home of Haneef or that of his in-laws. 

 The Ahmeds as well as Haneefs family have been asked to furnish their financial records to clear themselves of any suspicion of having received funds from dubious foreign sources.

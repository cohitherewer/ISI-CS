 Spotlight on soldier suicides

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Antony

 New Delhi, April 16: Defence minister A.K. Antony today set the agenda for top army commanders, saying they must first deal with soldier suicides and officer killings before moving on to issues as modernisation of equipment.

 Antony has personally put soldier suicides on top of his agenda since taking over in November. He has written to all chief ministers asking for help to mitigate family pressures on soldiers.

 The defence minister further put the stamp of his persona and frugal lifestyle on the army commanders conference. He asked the army to cut down on profligacy and adopt the motto service with simplicity. Expenditure on acquiring new equipment should be increased and wasteful expenditure slashed. But, above all, the minister said, the man behind the gun should take precedence.

 Till the human aspect is taken care of, all attempts at modernisation of the forces, providing better pay and allowances, training and discipline will not be able to achieve the desired results, Antony told the commanders and senior officers of the defence ministry. 

 He said the suicides and soldier-killing-soldier incidents were of grave concern.

 Antonys remarks come against a depressing background for the armed forces. Between January 1 and February 28, 20 soldiers from the armed forces have committed suicide while 10 have been killed in action. A summary general court martial has also sentenced a soldier to death for shooting an officer.

 Antony told the army chief, defence secretary, regional army commanders and principal staff officers it was essential to ease pressure on troops deployed for counter-insurgency. The need of the hour is to reduce stress levels among armed forces personnel. Psychological counselling and relaxation exercises, too, can go a long way in reducing the stress levels on jawans and help reduce cases of suicide and fratricide, he said.

 Antony has also asked the Defence Institute of Psychological Research and senior army officers to compile another report on the cases of suicide and fratricide. 

 He put the responsibility of improving morale squarely at the door of army headquarters even after the government had taken steps because the onus of maintaining the preparedness and morale of our armed forces lies with you. You have to make a collective effort to ensure that our forces continue to be in top physical and mental state.

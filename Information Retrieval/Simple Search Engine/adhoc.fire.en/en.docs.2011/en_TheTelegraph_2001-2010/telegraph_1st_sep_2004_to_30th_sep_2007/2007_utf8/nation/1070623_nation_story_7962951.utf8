 Past with no takers

 An Englishman visits the site of battle that launched the empire in which few of his generation take pride. Patrick Pringle reports

 What never ceases to astonish Britons of my generation is that our country ever had such an extraordinary stranglehold on so much of the world. Who were these people that conquered the world? 

 I realise that stranglehold effectively began on June 23, 1757, at 2pm in a field in Bengal.

 The memorial to the Battle of Plassey is situated at the end of an avenue of trees in a sleepy corner of Bengal. It is very much business as usual in Plassey (or Palashi) these days. It is almost inconceivable that this lush, peaceful area of the world ever bore witness to an event as thoroughly seismic as what happened 250 years ago. 

 Palashi is now a place that meshes perfectly into the rest of the flat, thick foliage of rural Bengal. When one asks where the actual battle took place, locals make vague gestures and speculate. 

 For an English visitor, the effective birthplace of nearly 200 years of British rule is a strange place. When I visited the memorial, one of the more informed local men sitting in a tea stall nearby said to a colleague of mine that this must be as much an anniversary for him as it is for us. I laughed rather awkwardly at this prescient assertion. What was once upon a time seen as one of Britains greatest coups is now seen in a rather more sobering post-colonial context.

 In a sense, it was heartening to go to such a historical place and to find that life has moved on. Evidently people havent forgotten the past, but there is a measured forgiveness. It is often remarked by English people that they are always amazed at how on the whole India has moved on, and bears few ostensible grudges to British people when they visit India, considering the gross subjugation that characterised British India. 

 For people who were born into the rather downbeat, grey post-industrial Britain of the late seventies and early eighties, we can scarcely reconcile the country we got with the all-conquering, Machiavellian gentlemen-adventurers that ruled India until 1947. While our grandparents and possibly even some of our parents were brought up with some degree of pride in Britains imperial conquests, for younger Britons, the empire seems to be a very distant thing. As L.P. Hartley wrote in The Go Between: The past is a foreign country, they do things differently there. 

 One of the most striking, immediate results of the battles outcome was the extraordinary financial ramifications that this farce of a battle had for the winners and the losers. Robert Clive ended up being the Bill Gates of colonialism. 

Under the terms of the agreement settled in the aftermath of this relatively minor skirmish in the Bengali countryside, Clive secured 2.5 million for the East India Company, and a further 234,000 for himself. 

 The British who were present at Palashi on that day in late June were to have a huge effect on Bengal in years to come. While Clive eventually sunk into depression and suicide, another Englishman present at the battle, Warren Hastings, ended up becoming the first governor-general of India. 

 Palashi itself may bear little sign of the enormous events of yesteryear, but Murshidabad is a place heaving with historical remnants. Evidence of the two empires that dominated Bengal are now in a state of disrepair, be it the mock Roman grandeur of the British buildings, or the crumbling tombs of the family of the Nawab of Murshidabad. The architecture of the British period is possibly the only aspect of British rule in India that the modern Briton can look remotely favourably on. 

 One of the saddest aspects of the Battle of Palashi from a retrospective English point of view was that this one event seemed to set Britain on a slippery slope of aggression and over-achievement. Palashi was an awakening. Out went the quaint, misguided and fanciful infatuation with all things exotic and oriental that characterised the British approach to India up to that point. In came an atavistic tone of ambition and destiny. 

 It is clear that Britain was an extraordinarily multi-faceted nation at that point in history. Some of those facets were positive, some otherwise. The events at Palashi were instrumental in creating one of the most negative facets of the Britain of yesteryear.

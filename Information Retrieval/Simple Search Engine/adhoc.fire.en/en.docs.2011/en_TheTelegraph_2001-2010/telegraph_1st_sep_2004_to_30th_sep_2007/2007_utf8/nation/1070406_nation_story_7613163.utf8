 Tax breaks, not ceiling, irk CPM 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 5: The Centre has accepted many of the CPMs suggestions on how the SEZ policy should be revised, but the party is concerned that its demand for curbs on the tax breaks was ignored.

 We are mainly concerned about the tax concessions. We will have to study the governments decisions. The party will give a response tomorrow, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said from Kerala today.

 The changes to the SEZ act are crucial for the CPM which, shaken by the Nandigram bloodbath, has put on hold all special economic zone projects in Bengal till the amendments are adopted.

 The Centre has also declined to accept the CPM demand to limit an SEZ to 5,000 acres (roughly 2,000 hectares).

 The government has set the ceiling at 12,500 acres (roughly 5,000 hectares). The states, though, have been given the option to fix a lower cap if they so wish.

 The higher ceiling makes room for two large SEZs proposed in Bengal the Salim Groups 10,000-acre chemical hub and the multi-product SEZ planned in Haldia. 

 With the Centre giving the state governments freedom to lower the ceiling, the CPM may find it tricky to justify the big SEZs in Bengal.

 Perhaps keeping the compulsions in mind, the party suggested that for the time being it would focus on the tax breaks. Asked about the 12,500-acre cap, Karat said: What we are really bothered about is tax concession.

 In a note sent to the Centre last October, the CPM had said: The revenue implications of tax holidays being given under the SEZ policy have to be seriously considered.

 The SEZ act now offers 100 per cent exemption from income tax on profits for the first five years and 50 per cent for the next five. 

 The CPM note said: Such fiscal incentives for new units if they need to be given at all should not exceed two years as was done in the case of Chinese SEZs.

 The party also opposed tax concessions for developers. Fiscal incentives for developers if at all should be separately specified. They should be considerably less than the ones provided for entrepreneurs in income tax as well as customs and excise duties.

 The tax breaks keep the state governments from making major revenue gains in the first 10 years.

 The Centre has also ignored the Left proposal for an apparatus to redress workers grievances in SEZs where normal labour laws dont apply. But it has accepted the suggestion to stipulate 50 per cent of the land area for processing in all SEZs.

 PMOs hidden weapon: Freelancer Saran

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, Aug. 31: The compromise on the nuclear deal and US participation in the biggest military aviation bidding in history would not have come about without the Prime Ministers Office retaking some of its lost authority in recent weeks.

 A significant fallout of the PMO reclaiming its lost turf is the rehabilitation of Shyam Saran as a key player in the operationalisation of the nuclear deal. 

 Since the beginning of this year, Saran had lost out to his successor foreign secretary, Shiv Shankar Menon, though the former was to have been Indias point man on all matters relating to the nuclear deal even after his retirement last year.

 Once Pranab Mukherjee became the key negotiator with the Left parties, the foreign minister is said to have ceded ground on the nuclear deal and sought to insulate his ministry from the controversy by allowing someone from the PMO Saran in this case to become the public face of the nuclear negotiations.

 Yesterdays formula on the nuclear deal actually allows Saran who has very little accountability since he is neither a civil servant like Menon nor a politician like Mukherjee or Manmohan Singh to freelance on the deal.

 The tilt in the balance had begun to take place from July 31, when national security adviser M.K. Narayanan brought in defence secretary Shekhar Dutt into the PMO to be his deputy in a new post created to look after strategic and defence-related subjects.

 Dutt who has been closely and regularly interacting with the Americans in recent years in his capacity as defence secretary and earlier as secretary for defence production was brought in to jump-start languishing military acquisitions and to enable the PMO to play a lead role on key defence strategy issues.

 From his South Block office of the ministry of defence, Dutt had headed the Indo-US Defence Policy Group for several years.

 The decision to move Dutt to be by Narayanans side was linked to the national security advisers emergence as the PMOs strongman in the run-up to the 123 negotiations on the nuclear deal with the US and efforts in the PMO to reclaim its traditional authority.

 Since the death of Narayanans predecessor, J.N. Dixit, in 2005, the PMO has steadily been reduced to a shadow of its former self from the heydays of former principal secretaries Brajesh Mishra and A.N. Verma.

 On July 31, Narayanan also quietly brought into the PMO Amber Sen, the second-ranking official in the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), Indias external spy agency, which has been in turmoil for several months.

 Sen, who has been on leave since January 31 in protest against the appointment of Ashok Chaturvedi as the new RAW chief, has also been appointed to a new post of deputy national security adviser.

 But unlike Dutt, Sen has not been assigned any portfolio in the PMO and is, therefore, likely to step into a new role as Narayanans trouble shooter.

 Sen will help Narayanan tighten his grip on the countrys notoriously loose intelligence set-up, including military intelligence, which has hitherto been beyond any accountability to the larger national intelligence network.

 Sen was hastily inducted into the PMO only hours before he was to retire from RAW on July 31.

 Narayanans emergence as the new strongman in the government is said to be linked to the retirement of B.K. Chaturvedi as cabinet secretary in June.

 Chaturvedi, a smooth civil servant well-equipped to fight bureaucratic turf battles, had made considerable inroads into the PMOs turf during his three-year tenure as cabinet secretary and become an alternative centre of power in New Delhi.

 He is related to the new RAW chief, whose supersession was reversed shortly before his appointment as chief, forcing Sen to go on protest leave.

 Narayanan began the process of expanding his turf and regaining the PMOs authority in the run-up to Chaturvedis retirement. 

 In April, he set the ball rolling by filling an year-long vacancy caused by the departure of deputy national security adviser Vijay Nambiar to join the UN as special adviser to the previous UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan.

 Narayanan appointed Leela Ponappa as successor to Nambiar, but the process was interrupted by political and bureaucratic factors.

 The recent appointments to the PMO and the requests for proposal related to 126 multi-role combat aircraft are pointers that Narayanan has made progress in his new course.

 Narayanan spent a major part of his years as an Intelligence Bureau official specialising in communist threats and is said to have provided intellectual inputs for the Prime Ministers recent decision to take on the Left supporters of the UPA on the nuclear deal and other issues. 

 IAEA Options 

 Atomic energy chief Anil Kakodkar has suggested that options are open on discussing the safeguards agreement at the IAEA meeting in Vienna from September 17 to 21.

 I will be taking a call two days before the general meeting, he said. The Left has said the safeguards agreement must not be discussed at that meeting.

 Mayavati slams PM in Gujarat

 Vadodara, Sept. 16 (PTI): Mayavati today took her social engineering strategy to Gujarat, accusing the BJP and the Congress of conspiring to deny quotas to the upper-caste poor.

 The Uttar Pradesh chief minister said she had offered the Centre support for the move but Manmohan Singh shot down the proposal. 

 I told the Prime Minister that the BSP was ready to support the ruling alliance in amending the Constitution. But he replied in the negative, Mayavati said at a rally launching her partys campaign for the polls at the end of the year.

 Mayavati, keen to forge a backward class-Brahmin alliance in Gujarat after it swept her to power this year, has set aside 10 per cent jobs for weaker sections among upper castes in new industrial projects in Uttar Pradesh.

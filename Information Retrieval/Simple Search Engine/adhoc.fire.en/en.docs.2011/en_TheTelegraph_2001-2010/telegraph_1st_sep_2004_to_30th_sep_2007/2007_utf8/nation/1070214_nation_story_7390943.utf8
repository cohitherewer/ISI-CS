 Big Brother to watch Delhi, with 200 eyes

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: Two government departments plan to set up an array of 200 cameras strategically positioned to gaze at streets and buildings across Delhi, enveloping the capital with shades of Big Brother technology. 

 They will create a three-dimensional model of Delhi and use cameras to constantly monitor its public spaces for myriad activities from tracking illegal construction to planning road repairs to scheduling garbage pickup, officials said. 

 The ministries of science and technology and urban development today jointly announced their intention to complete the project in three years, claiming that it will introduce transparency and reduce corruption in land-use issues. 

 The plan is to stretch across the capital a project implemented last year in thickly populated Chandni Chowk whose narrow lanes and buildings have already been captured in the model using 20 cameras. 

 This technology will be useful for every city in the country, said urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy.

 The Survey of India (SOI) will produce 3-D representations of streets and buildings to create a database of structures, including fine architectural features. The images archived in a central repository will be used to detect unauthorised constructions. The images will help the ministry to determine exactly when the illegal construction took place, and can be used as evidence. Pictures dont lie, Reddy said. 

 When the Chandni Chowk project began last year, experts in technology law had cautioned that cameras gazing on streets and buildings may invoke images of Big Brother. 

 Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said the cameras arent going to go inside anyones bedroom. 

 Indias surveyor-general told The Telegraph that government agencies would receive images of streets and buildings without people. 

 While the SOI receives real-time images with people, we will eliminate the signals specifically associated with each person that appears in an image before handing them to government agencies, said Major-General M. Gopal Rao.

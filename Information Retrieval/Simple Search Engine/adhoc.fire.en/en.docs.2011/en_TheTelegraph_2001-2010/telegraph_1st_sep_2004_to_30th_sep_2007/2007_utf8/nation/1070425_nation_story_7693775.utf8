 Memory cheer in migraine misery

 CAN HEADACHES BE GOOD?

 New Delhi, April 24: Migraine headaches that torment millions of women worldwide may also be protecting their memory and other brain functions in unknown ways, a new study has suggested.

 The study by researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore, US, has shown that women who have lived with migraine display less decline in brain functions than women who have never had migraine.

 The findings, presented today in the journal Neurology, suggest that medicines, diet and exercise often used to tackle migraine attacks by regular sufferers may play a role in protecting brain functions.

 But the researchers arent ruling out that migraine may have some positive side effects on the brain.

 It seems likely that there may be some underlying biological mechanism such as changes in blood vessels or differences in brain activity that results in decreased cognitive decline over time, said Amanda Kalaydjian, lead author of the study from the Johns Hopkins School.

 Neurologists know that recurrent and severe headaches that mark migraine are caused by dilated blood vessels in the brain, but the mechanisms underlying the changes remain unresolved. Migraine is twice as common in women as in men, and is sometimes triggered by food, disturbed sleep, hormonal changes, hunger or even weather changes.

 While certain medicines, such as ibuprofen, used in the treatment of migraine headaches may have a small protective effect on memory and thus may partly explain the findings, Kalaydjian said, other factors need to be explored.

 Kalaydjian said diet, relaxation, and reduction in caffeine intake are among other techniques that women may be employing to beat migraine and which may have as yet unknown effects on the brain.

 These findings seem to fit in with recent studies that have established that neurons (brain cells) are constantly created in the brain, said Vijayalakshmi Ravindranath, director of the National Brain Research Centre near New Delhi.

 Its called adult neurogenesis, but the rate of formation of new neurons declines with age, Ravindranath said. Recent laboratory studies show that exercise can improve brain functions through neurogenesis, she said.

 Researchers have observed that rats placed on treadmills a form of exercise show improved brain functions as well as higher rates of neuron formation.

 In their study, Kalaydjian and her colleagues gave brain function and memory tests to 1,448 women, including 204 with migraine. While the women with migraine performed worse in the tests at the beginning of the study, their performance declined 17 per cent less over several years than women who did not have migraine.

 The results showed that women with classical migraine an attack preceded by flashing lights had lower loss of cognitive functions, with women over the age of 50 showing the least amount of cognitive decline.

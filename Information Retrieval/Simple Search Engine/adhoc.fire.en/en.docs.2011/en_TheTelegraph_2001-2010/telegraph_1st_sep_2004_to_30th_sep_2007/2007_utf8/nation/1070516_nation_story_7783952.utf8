 Blow to art face-saver panel

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandra Mohan

 Ahmedabad, May 15: The MS University vice-chancellors attempt to wriggle out of the obscene art controversy has suffered a setback with some faculty members refusing to join a fact-finding committee.

 Vice-chancellor Manoj Soni set up the committee to look into the incidents of May 9 when student Chandra Mohan was arrested for displaying allegedly obscene art. VHP and BJP activists had barged into the campus and vandalised the exhibition. 

 However, at least two senior faculty members declined to be part of the committee. I do not think such a committee will serve any purpose, said Prerna Mohite, dean, home science.

 As it is, the arts faculty has closed today. And I will not be available as Im going on a long holiday, she added.

 Sources in the Vadodara University Teachers Association said though Mohite was known to be pro-establishment, she was hesitant to join the committee meant to help the vice-chancellor emerge unscathed from the scandal.

 Syed Masood, the convener of the proposed panel, said: No one has refused to join so far. 

 The committees mandate is to look into the facts and evidence related to last weeks incidents and subsequent developments. We will give the reports at the earliest, said Masood, dean, law. 

 Asked whether the committee would also look into the suspension of Shivaji Panikkar, the dean of fine arts who has gone into hiding fearing for his life, Masood said: If that falls under our purview, we will certainly look into it. Panikkar was suspended because he refused to shut down the exhibition. 

 Soni is chief minister Narendra Modis handpicked vice-chancellor and, at 40, probably the youngest to be appointed to the post.

 The vice-chancellor is now caught in the crossfire between the Sangh parivar and civil rights activists. Chandra Mohan was yesterday granted bail.

 Panikkar told The Telegraph from an undisclosed location that his friends advised him to go underground after many unknown people started visiting his place and making enquiries about him.

 Such goondas have no moral qualms and they can harm me, said Panikkar, who left his home on May 11, the day he was suspended. 

 Ever since, Panikkar said, he has been watching the good turn of events from a distance and he is happy about the support he and his student received from the art fraternity.

 The University Grants Commission (UGC), apparently acting on instructions from human resource development minister Arjun Singh, has asked for a clarification on the suspension of Panikkar.

 UGC chairman Sukhadeo Thorat sent a letter to the university after a meeting with the Union minister.

 Singh later said the Centre did not have much right to intervene in the matter as the university was under the state government. 

 There are certain things which are universal and freedom of expression is one of them. But the HRD minister added: It is a state university. I dont think we can comment on the issue.

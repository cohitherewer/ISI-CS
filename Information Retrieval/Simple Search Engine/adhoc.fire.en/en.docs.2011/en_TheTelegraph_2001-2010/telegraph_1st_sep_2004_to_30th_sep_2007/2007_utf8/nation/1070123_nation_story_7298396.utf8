The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 To UN, with Rajivs legacy

 - Rahul 

 on green mission 

 K.P. NAYAR

 Rahul Gandhi

 Washington, Jan. 22: Four months after making his foray into diplomacy and global politics at the UN headquarters, Rahul Gandhi is to build on it with a potentially high-profile visit to Washington next month. 

 This time, he will rub shoulders in the US capital with two presidential hopefuls in the 2008 election to the White House: Republican Senator John McCain and Democrat Joe Biden, the latter now chairman of the powerful Senate foreign relations committee. 

 Also appearing at the same venue with Rahul next month will be Paul Wolfowitz, president of the World Bank, David Miliband, Britains secretary of state for environment, Yuriko Koike, national security adviser to the Japanese Prime Minister, and Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group. 

 Germanys Chancellor Angela Merkel will also speak, but by video, to a meeting on Capitol Hill of international legislators from the Group of Eight (G8) industrialised countries and key emerging economies to discuss climate change. 

 The key emerging economies to be represented at this meeting on February 14 and 15 are India, China, South Africa, Mexico and Brazil. 

 The World Bank said in a media advisory that Rahul had agreed to participate in the meeting being organised primarily by the Global Legislators for a Balanced Environment or GLOBE and the Alliance of Communicators for Sustainable Development, known as COM Plus. 

 Otaviano Canuto, the World Banks executive director for Brazil, is member of the board of advisers of the G8 and Plus-5 Legislators Dialogue on Climate Change, which has invited Rahul. 

 GLOBE was founded 18 years ago as an inter-parliamentary consultative group between the US Congress and the European Parliament to respond to urgent environmental challenges, but it has expanded its horizons as the environment attracted greater political attention worldwide. 

 The COM Plus alliance is a partnership of international organisations committed to advancing a vision of sustainable development that integrates economic, social and environmental elements. 

 Rahuls decision to be in the US at a time when the Uttar Pradesh election scene is hot is certain to raise questions about his role and participation in electioneering in the state. But sources with close ties to 10 Janpath said this decision must be seen in the context of Rajiv Gandhis and Indira Gandhis commitment to the environment. 

 A landmark address by Rajiv Gandhi, as Prime Minister, was to the UN General Assembly on October 19, 1987. It was one of the first major statements by India on protecting the environment.

 The decision also indicates that Rahul has chosen issues like human rights and environment as his constituencies for a global role. 

 In October, Rahuls first active intervention as a member of the Indian delegation to the current General Assembly was in the Assemblys human rights debate in its Third Committee, which deals with social, humanitarian and cultural issues. 

 But unlike his visit to the UN, Rahuls appearance at the February conference cannot but be high profile because of nature of such conferences in the US capital.

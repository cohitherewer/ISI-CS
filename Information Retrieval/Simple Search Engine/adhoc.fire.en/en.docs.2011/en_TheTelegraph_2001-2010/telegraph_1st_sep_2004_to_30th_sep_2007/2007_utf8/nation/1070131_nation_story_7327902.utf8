 Mumbai, Jan. 30: In an apparent attempt to make up for his lacklustre performance at a public meeting on Sunday, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray stoked a fresh controversy by accusing President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam of bias for delaying a decision on Mohammad Afzals mercy petition.

 Thackerays remarks have evoked protests from the Congress and the NCP in Mumbai and New Delhi for drawing the Presidents office into a controversy. 

 Maharashtra deputy chief minister R.R. Patil has expressed displeasure at the remarks. The state unit of the Congress has demanded an apology from the Sena leader, who turned 80 last week.

 The Shiv Sena sought to play down the controversy by saying that the cartoonist in Thackeray prevailed over the politician. It said the Sena chief had merely attempted to express the anger prevailing among people for the delay in executing Afzal, who has been sentenced to death in the Parliament attack case.

 Making a final attempt to woo voters for the February 1 civic elections in Mumbai, Thane and eight other cities in Maharashtra, Thackeray on Monday attacked Kalam, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in a manner which many found derogatory.

 He poked fun at Kalam by attributing his failure to decide on Afzals mercy petition to his locks of hair. 

 Presidents in the past would lose no time in dismissing mercy petitions relating to traitors. Who is this Afzal that one should be fond of? How come the President is unable to locate Afzals mercy petition file? Is it that his (Kalams) hair is falling over his eyes and blocking his eyesight or is he seeing moon and stars? Thackeray asked in Marathi, imitating Kalam brushing off his hair.

 The Sena chief even went on to question the existence of the Presidents office.

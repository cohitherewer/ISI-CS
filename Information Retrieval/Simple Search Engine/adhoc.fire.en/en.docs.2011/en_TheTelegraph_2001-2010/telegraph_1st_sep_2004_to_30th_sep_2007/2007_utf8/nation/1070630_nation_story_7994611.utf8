 Bandh cloud on Mamata

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 29: The Trinamul Congress and Mamata Banerjee must explain to Calcutta High Court in writing why they shouldnt face contempt proceedings for defying its order to call off a bandh on December 3, 2004.

 The court issued the order today in a case that is historic because the November 30, 2004, directive was the first by the judiciary to a political party to withdraw a bandh call. It had prompted arch-foe CPM to join Trinamul in protesting that parties had a right to call bandhs.

 The matter will come up for hearing after a fortnight.

 Trinamul had called the state-wide bandh against the Centres decision to raise the price of petroleum. Idris Ali, an advocate, had challenged the calls legality in a public interest litigation.

 A division bench had then cited a Supreme Court ruling that had declared bandhs illegal and asked Mamata to withdraw her call. With no Trinamul leader available to receive the order, a copy was pasted on the door of the party office at Topsia. When Trinamul went ahead with the bandh, Ali moved a contempt petition, on which the court issued todays directive.

 Appearing for Trinamul and Mamata, advocate and former party MLA Kalyan Banerjee claimed the party was unaware of the court order. But Ali rejected this, saying: The party leaders had made media statements against the order.

 Mamata had then been quoted as saying she would move the Supreme Court against the high court order.

 Senior CPM leader Shyamal Chakraborty had hinted that his party might be ready to address the larger issue with Trinamul support.

 Today, Trinamul MLA Saugata Roy said: These PILs have become a way of seeking publicity for a few professional litigants.

 Seattle, July 9: It was possibly the largest corporate television and Internet broadcast event in history. And it began with the bansuri and a backdrop of Taj Mahal.

 When Boeing lifted the curtain on its first all-new plane in 12 years the 787 Dreamliner India had a large presence at the celebrations.

 The repeated recognition of India throughout the one-hour ceremony here on Sunday was a tribute to Air Indias large order for 27 of the new aircraft and to Jet Airways which is buying another 10 Dreamliners.

 In all, airlines in India have ordered 138 brand new aircraft of various specifications from Boeing in the last two years as civil aviation has taken a big leap upwards in the country.

 The bansuri was one of the instruments chosen for the opening theme song of the Dreamliner premiere along with flutes from several countries which are buying the new plane: among the other instruments were a Japanese flute, Shakuhachi, and Tanso from South Korea.

 Air India and Jet Airways flew in hostesses dressed in their airline uniforms to be on the stage for the rollout along with stewardesses from 45 other airlines that have ordered the Dreamliner.

 The first fully assembled 787 rolled in before an audience of 15,000 guests at Boeings plant in Everett on the outskirts of Seattle, said to be the worlds largest built-up facility.

 But nearby, at a huge National Football League stadium, there was an even bigger party going on. There, another 25,000 Boeing employees and retired employees watched the rollout on a huge screen and partied.

 The main ceremony, in which Boeings global partners and suppliers from Europe and Asia participated via satellite, was telecast live to an estimated 12 million viewers in the US and another 100million international viewers in 45 countries, it was claimed.

 Boeing officials said 35 satellite networks across the globe were for this telecast, making it the largest corporate event on the small screen and the Internet.

 In addition to the events in Everett and the stadium nearby, there were celebrations at a rented barn on a horsetrack in London, South Carolina, Kansas and aboard a cruise ship in the waters off Washington state.

 Those who planned the event in Everett borrowed from the ideas of mass entertainers such as Madonna and U2 who use a video screen called MiSPHERE to project a 3-D vision.

 Boeing chose Sunday for the premiere because the date, 7-8-07 the way Americans write it, coincides with the new planes series: 787. 

 The first Dreamliner will go to Japans All Nippon Airways (ANA), but only by May 2008, in time for that airline to fly Japanese sports enthusiasts to the Beijing Olympics, an ANA official at the celebrations said.

 In what is probably the biggest acknowledgement of Boeings success with the new plane, the CEO of rival Airbus, Louis Gallois, wrote to Boeings chief executive Jim McNerney: Even if tomorrow Airbus will get back to the business of competing vigorously, today is Boeings day a day to celebrate the 787.

 The 787 will have a new anti-turbulence system, bigger than usual windows and higher humidity levels to reduce passenger dehydration.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Awake for Sourav, 

greeted by movie

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 Calcutta, March 12: Countless bleary-eyed cricket lovers who stayed up through much of last night were cheated of the images theyd been waiting for the Indian team striding down the track at the opening ceremony of the World Cup.

 SET Max, the channel which had acquired the rights to air the much-awaited event in India, said it had never planned to beam the opening ceremony live.

 This morning, placard-waving cricket fans hit the streets condemning the broadcaster for not serving public interest.

 We had been waiting for this event for months and what we got after a sleepless night is an old Hindi film. It is rather inconsiderate of the people who are heading the channel to dupe us the way they did, said J. K. Das of Tollygunge.

 It is a matter of national pride seeing the Souravs and Sachins at the inaugural function of a World Cup. It is one of the few events Indians look to win, fretted Nilotpal Ghosh Chowdhury of Shyambazar.

 Kunal Dasgupta, CEO of SET Discovery, said the ceremony in the West Indies wasnt meant to be telecast live. Only the highlights are to be shown at 5.30 pm on Tuesday.

 We never planned to telecast it live on our network because in India, it would be in the dead of the night. Not many would watch the telecast, especially with the board exams going on, he added.

 Another channel run by the same group had run into rough weather over a programme on advertisements that the government found distasteful.

 A couple of months back, the ministry had banned AXN, an entertainment channel of the same group. The law on sharing live feed with Doordarshan, recently proposed by the ministry and passed by Parliament, made things worse, a television industry official said.

 Private broadcasters, sources say, are now under increasing pressure to toe the ministrys line.

 To buy television rights to such events, companies have to pay huge amounts. They can realise the amount only from ad revenues, the official said.

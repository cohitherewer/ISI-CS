 Mechanism momentum sets up Sonia-Left talks

 OUR BUREAU 

 New Delhi, Aug. 28: A meeting between Sonia Gandhi and Left leaders are expected to cap the ongoing parleys to decide on a mechanism to look into the nuclear deal.

 Sources said Pranab Mukherjee, the governments principal trouble-shooter, would brief the Congress chief and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow on the talks the foreign minister has had with the Left.

 After that, Sonia is likely to meet Left leaders like Prakash Karat and A.B. Bardhan, the sources said.

 Based on the feedback, the government is likely to set up a committee within three-to-four days, a source said.

 Although the Left has not given up its demand that the government should not operationalise the nuclear deal, the threat of an immediate withdrawal of support further receded today with Bardhan ruling out destabilisation.

 We have no intention either to destabilise the government or the country or force an immediate election. This has not been our intention, Bardhan said.

 He said the committee would study the impact of the Hyde Act on Indias foreign policy and strategic programmes, safeguards and cost-effectiveness of energy generation. 

 But the RSP today broke ranks with other Left parties to oppose the mechanism. What is the need for a committee when we are opposed to the deal? RSP leader Abani Roy asked after a meeting with the Congress negotiators.

 This is the first time in over three years of the UPA regime that the government held separate meetings with RSP and Forward Bloc leaders. 

 Bardhan sought to play down the RSP stand. Why did the RSP sign the four-party statement that talked about such a committee as well? he asked.

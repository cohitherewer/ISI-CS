 Foxy welcome for fliers

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Wild caper

 Bhopal, Jan. 18: A rare welcome awaits fliers to the Madhya Pradesh capital on touchdown a wildlife show. But only jackals, not the states famed tigers, strut their stuff.

 One such grand spectacle at the Raja Bhoj airport was in store for 92 passengers of a plane from Delhi on Wednesday. 

 Not far from the town, however, there was another show going on: chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan was crowing about infrastructure before a throng of bemused foreign investors whod been herded to idyllic Khajuraho. No red tape, only red carpets for you, he told them. Industry minister Babulal Gaur joined in the spiel.

 But it wasnt on carpets where some real-life action was taking place. It was on the Bhopal airport runway, where pilot Shishupal was slamming the emergency brakes of his Boeing 737, having spotted a fox cavorting around.

 Airport director Shakti Dev sought to underplay the foxs presence, saying only a thorough probe would get the facts. It was his word against the pilots, who insisted it was the animal that caused the jerky landing.

 It is possible that some of the foreign investors whom Chauhan was trying to cajole might take a plane to Bhopal. If they do, they must be ready for the wild encounter.

 In any case, the state doesnt offer automatic confidence among investors, like some of those in the south, said industrialist Rajendra Kothari, who is part of the Madhya Pradesh chapter of PHD Chamber of Commerce. The incident at the airport is a serious matter and all angles should be probed, he said, as he reeled off figures that showed the state gets 0.2 per cent of all the foreign direct investment flowing into the country.

 In Khajuraho, it was hard not to be romantic. But when only six of the 45 NRIs expressed their intention to invest in the state, it was clear money, unlike love, wasnt blind.

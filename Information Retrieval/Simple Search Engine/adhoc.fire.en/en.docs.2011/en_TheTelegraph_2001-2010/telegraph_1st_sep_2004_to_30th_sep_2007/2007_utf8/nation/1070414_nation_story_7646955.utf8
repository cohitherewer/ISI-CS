 Priyanka takes charge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, April 13: Priyanka Gandhi Vadra arrived today to take charge of the election campaign in Amethi and Rae Bareli her familys home ground while brother Rahul and mother Sonia work the crowds in the rest of the state.

 Priyanka landed in Lucknow (in PTI picture) around 11.30 am and headed straight to Munshiganj in Amethi, her brothers constituency, where she is to hold a meeting with party workers and try and persuade the rebels to withdraw from the poll.

 Polling in the 10 Assembly segments of Amethi and Rae Bareli, which is Sonias seat, will be held on April 28. Today was the last date for withdrawal of nominations.

 Several Congress workers, unhappy at being denied a ticket, have filed their papers as Independents.

 She is expected to start her campaign for both the places from next week. But she began her interaction with party workers today, Viren Madan, a spokesman for the Uttar Pradesh Congress, said. 

 Although Amethi and Rae Bareli have traditionally voted the Nehru-Gandhis to Parliament, the Congress has cut a sorry figure in Assembly polls in the past. In 2002, the Congress won only one seat each in Amethi and Rae Bareli.

 Makeover for Howrah

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 15: Howrah station has got a ticket to a makeover that could turn it into a world-class rail hub.

 A slice of Rs 300,000 crore meant for modernisation of 20 stations should flow to the station which, along with the Howrah bridge, is Calcuttas most enduring landmark.

 Clearance for the plan came today from the Prime Ministers committee on infrastructure, which also green-lighted proposals to spruce up Patna, Bhubaneswar, New Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai stations. 

 Work on the revamp to be executed through public-private partnerships will be over before the 2010 Commonwealth Games. 

 The new-look Howrah station will have state-of-the-art buildings, separate departure and arrival halls and elevators to help passengers move from one platform to another. Bigger food plazas and communication centres will be added attractions.

 The first of the station revamps will be in New Delhi, which will have to handle tourists for the Commonwealth Games. A sum of Rs 5,000 crore has been set aside for the purpose.

 Railway minister Lalu Prasad, who attended the meeting, said global consultants will be roped in for the modernisation. One will be shortlisted within a week so that work (on the New Delhi station) can start soon, he added.

 Of the Rs 300,000 crore to be invested, Rs 200,000 crore will come from the central government, market borrowings and the railways earnings. Private firms roped in for the revamp will bring the rest. An inter-ministerial panel will finalise the terms for private firms by October.

 The infrastructure committee also cleared plans to modernise Chennai airport. The Airport Authority of India has got the job. The first phase is estimated to cost Rs 2,000 crore, said Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel.

 The proposal for a greenfield airport at Sriperumbudur was also approved. The Tamil Nadu government has already identified 4,200 acres for it. A feasibility study for the project will be carried out shortly.

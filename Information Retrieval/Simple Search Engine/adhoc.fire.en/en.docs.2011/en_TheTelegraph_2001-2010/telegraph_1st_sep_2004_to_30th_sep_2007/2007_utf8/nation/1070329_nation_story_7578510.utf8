 Sunita stuck in space, with no samosas

 Washington, March 28: Indian-American astronaut Sunita Pandya Williams, who has been living on an international space station (ISS) since December 2006, is stuck in space.

 But the bright side of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) schedule being thrown out of gear is that Sunita may set a new US record for continuous stay in space.

 Going by Nasas account of the latest problem to hit the US space programme, Sunita may not yet break the world record for the longest stay in space. That record of 437 days belongs to Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov. 

 Kirk Shireman, Nasas deputy manager for the ISS programme, told reporters last evening that Sunitas planned return to earth in July may be delayed because a hailstorm had disrupted Nasas flight plans for the rest of this year.

 Her return to earth in July was to have been on space shuttle Endeavour, which will now be launched much later than its original date of June 28. That is because the hailstorm damaged an external tank of space shuttle Atlantis preventing the orbiter from lifting off as planned on March 15. Atlantis is now expected to take off on April 10. 

 This delay will have a ripple effect on further schedules of space flights raising a question mark over the Indian-American astronauts plans to return home.

 Sunita said in a web chat a few days ago that she was already missing her favourite samosas. She had carried samosas, saag paneer and chhole with her when she went on her space flight. But they have already been exhausted, sharing the Indian snacks with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Tyrurin and mission commander Michael Lopez-Alegria, her crewmates on the ISS.

 Hopefully I will be getting some samosas before too long, Sunita had said during that chat, but it now appears she may have a longer wait for any replenishments.

 Unfortunately for Sunita, the delay in sending her samosas follows an accident a few weeks ago when wasabi, the spicy green condiment used to prepare Japanese meals, squirted out of a tube when the Indian-American was preparing a sushi meal for herself with salmon.

 Because there is no gravity in space, the wasabi floated all over the ISS and cleaning it up was quite a challenge for Sunita and her crewmates.

 We finally got the wasabi smell out after it was flying around everywhere, Sunita confided to her mother in a conversation after the mishap.

 But then the crew decided they wouldnt use wasabi any more, depriving Sunita of sushi, another of her favourites. I dont think we are going to use it anymore, she told her mother. It is too dangerous.

 Shireman told reporters last evening: We are doing things we can as best we can to make her (Sunita) happy and perhaps launch some special items that will make her more comfortable for that extended period of time. Aside from that, there is not a whole lot that one can do.

 American astronaut Lopez-Alegria will create a US record of 214 days in space when he returns to earth from the ISS on April 20 on a Russian vehicle, but that record will soon afterwards be broken by Sunita.

 Teachers learn a lesson

This was one class children would have loved, for their teachers were being taught a lesson in story telling. 

 American author Cathy Spagnoli was in the capital this week to conduct a workshop for 300 teachers from across 80 schools.

 India has a rich heritage of story telling but, unfortunately, its not given importance nowadays in our educational institutions, said C.K. Shaji, who works with Jodo Gyan, a non-profit organisation here.

 Jodo Gyan, engaged in teaching science and mathematics through innovative methods, had brought Spagnoli to India. 

 According to Spagnoli, key elements of stories characters and plot as well as presentation and expression may be used to engage children in subjects that are taught through lectures.

 I SPY a gift from Guruji

A SPY training is on in Chennai, for pregnant women. Before you do a double take, SPY is the acronym for Suga Prasava Yoga (yoga for a smooth delivery).

 A bearded Sankar Guruji, clad in a dhoti and a saffron kurta, promises to teach mothers-to-be a yoga that can help them give birth to exceptional and divinely gifted babies, like the avatars whove stopped visiting this world. The training also helps make the delivery smoother, he claims.

 Guruji has set up base at Chennais Udupi Woodlands Drive-In restaurant. 

 The first day saw a crowd of curious, and some concerned, visitors as they drove into the restaurant and saw the banner serving up the information on SPY.

 But the word is now spreading and the ladies are lining up to be enlisted for training. 

 Inside a hall, Guruji counsels women and teaches them meditation techniques that they should practice during pregnancy.

 In a few months from now, one of them might be cradling a Krishna or a Christ, courtesy Guruji.

 Tech truce

When it comes to politics, he might grit his teeth at rivals. But in a tussle for the IT pie, he grins and shares it.

 N. Chandrababu Naidu, the former CEO of Andhra Pradesh, during a visit to Bangalore heaped praises on Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna for his amazing work in the IT sector.

 Of course, he did not forget to pat his own back. 

 Putting Hyderabad on the global map was a major task for me. I visited global giants across the world and pitched for the Nizams city, he said. 

Delhi: A 60-minute award-winning film on Kathakali artiste Kottakkal Sivaram will be screened at the Films Division Mahadeva Auditorium at 6 pm on February 27.

 Sivaram excels in portraying women characters like Draupadi, Damayanti, and Sita.

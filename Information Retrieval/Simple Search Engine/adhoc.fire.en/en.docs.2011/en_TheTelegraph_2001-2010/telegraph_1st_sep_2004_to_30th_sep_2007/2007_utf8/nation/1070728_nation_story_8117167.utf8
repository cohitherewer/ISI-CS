 Pesky call list by Sept 5

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Do not call

 New Delhi, July 27: Come September, mobile phone users will be able to sign up with a Do Not Call registry to shut out unwanted offers of home loans, credit cards and holiday packages, the government has promised the Supreme Court.

 Those who register with the Do Not Call registry will not receive unsolicited calls, said P.P. Gupta, the government counsel, adding that the registry would be operational from September 5. 

 Private telecom companies said they were ready to comply with the governments plan and would set up toll-free numbers for people to get their names and numbers registered.

 The apex court which acted on a public interest litigation that said such calls violate an individuals right to privacy and put a cost burden on cellphone users with roaming facilities had asked the Centre to submit the guidelines and regulations issued to stop the menace.

 It has become a menace. Where are the rules and regulations to check such nuisance? The regulations submitted by the government are toothless, Justice A.K. Mathur had said. Even I received a call from a private bank for a loan.

 The two-member bench, headed by Justice Mathur, suggested that instead of a Do Not Call registry, the government should register those cellphone users who might want to receive sales calls to keep themselves updated.

 Look at your difficulty. You cannot restrain commercial calls. Very few people would like to be disturbed, the bench observed.

 After hearing arguments from all the parties, the court asked the petitioner to be patient and posted the matter for hearing on September 21.

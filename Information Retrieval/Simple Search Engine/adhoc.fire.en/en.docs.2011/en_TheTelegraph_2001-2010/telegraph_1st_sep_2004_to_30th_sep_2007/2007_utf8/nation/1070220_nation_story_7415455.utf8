 Tandoor death sentence upheld

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 19: Delhi High Court has upheld the death sentence awarded by a trial court to former Youth Congress leader Sushil Sharma in the tandoor murder case.

 Sharma had murdered his wife Naina Sahni and dumped the body in an oven at a restaurant run by a friend to destroy evidence.

 Dismissing Sharmas appeal that the trial court verdict was biased and unfair, a division bench of Justices P.K. Bhasin and R.S. Sodhi said: The offence was not committed on the spur of the moment as alleged by the accused. It was a premeditated act of butchery, which leaves no room for compassion. It was an act of extreme depravity.

 Delhi police had found Sahnis charred body from the oven at Baghiya, a restaurant in New Delhis Ashok Yatri Niwas now called the Shangri La hotel on July 3, 1995.

 The death sentence of Priyadarshini Mattoo rape-and-murder accused Santosh Kumar Singh, who has challenged a Delhi High Court order convicting him in the case, was stayed by the Supreme Court today.

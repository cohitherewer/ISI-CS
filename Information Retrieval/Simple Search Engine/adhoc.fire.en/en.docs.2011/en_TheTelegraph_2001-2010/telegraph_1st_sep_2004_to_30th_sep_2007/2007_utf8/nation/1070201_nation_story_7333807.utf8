 Mayor quota for women

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 31: Six of the 10 civic bodies, including those in Mumbai, Pune and Thane, going to polls tomorrow will have women mayors as part of a reservation policy being implemented in Maharashtra.

 Mumbai has had three women mayors in the past two from the Shiv Sena and one from the Congress. But there has been a long gap since then in the countrys richest municipal corporation. 

 The decision came after a draw of lots by the urban development department today to decide on the reservation for the mayoral post in municipal corporations across the state. Minister of state for urban development Rajesh Tope announced the results. 

 Ten of the states 22 municipal corporations are going to polls, and six of them will have women mayors. 

 They include Mumbai, Pimpri-Chinchwad (both will have mayors from back- ward classes), Ulhasnagar (scheduled caste), Thane, Pune and Sholapur (general category).

 Movies to beat budget fatigue

 A self-proclaimed reluctant chief minister, Muthuvel Karunanidhi has had to spend the last few weeks putting the nuts and bolts of the Tamil Nadu budget into place.

 To avoid visitors, he would drive away to the Temple Bay seaside hotel in Mamallapuram and pore over papers.

 But in between the tedium of understanding fiscal deficits and tax twisters, Karunanidhi watched movies, a passion he has harboured since his days as a scriptwriter. The grapevine at his Gopalapuram home has it that the chief minister watched three new Tamil movies Lee, Paruthi Veeran and Mozhi in just two days.

 But there could be other reasons for the compulsive movie-watching. Karunanidhis sons, M.K. Stalin and M.K. Azhagiri, are already in politics. Now, his poetess-daughter Kanimozhi is ready to take the plunge. With so many in the family vying for lead roles, it is no wonder the 83-year-old DMK patriarch turned to movies for a break.

 Century shield on Viru home

 When irate Team India supporters targeted Mahendra Singh Dhonis Ranchi house, Virender Sehwag, surviving in the team purely on past merit, may well have been wondering if it would be his turn next. 

 The Delhi destroyer can now relax. By the polices own admission, their efforts to guard Sehwags four-storey bungalow in Najafgarh has become that much easier thanks to the blistering century against Bermuda. 

 We dont think Sehwags house will be targeted now. He can relax, and so can we, says deputy commissioner (south west) Ravinder Yadav. 

 Yadav admits, though, that his 10 constables had a few anxious moments during Mondays match, when Sehwag missed a few deliveries. Sources said the police had received a call from the batsmans house late on Saturday seeking protection. 

 Womens special

 Mumbai is making life easier for its women. First, there was a special cab service and now, plans for womens special BEST buses have begun to roll faster than expected.

 Pushing the idea is Vidya Thakur, the new deputy mayor of BMC, which runs the BEST buses. 

 I might be a mayor, but I am a woman first. Women are prone to physical and mental harassment in local trains and BEST buses. Its necessary to have womens buses, she says. Women conductors for the buses are being recruited now. 

 The move is already drawing cheers. More than 12 seats in buses are reserved for women but they arent enough. I am happy Vidya is thinking of women, says Sherie Thomas, who travels regularly from her Dadar home.

 Blurred vision

 He is possibly one of the best soothsayers in town, predicting the direction of prices and the course of the economy.

 But early this week, RBI governor Y.V. Reddy stumped many when he said he wasnt in a position to give his take on future monetary policy. The reason: he couldnt predict Ugadi, the Telugu New Year.

 The Andhra economist cited the difference of opinion among Telugu pundits on reading Panchang Sarvanam, their religious almanac. I am not able to predict monetary policy in economies in general, even in India, for the next year since I am yet to hear about the new year, which is called Sarvajeet, he told a conference.

 Reddy joked that Telugus love their freedom to chose including festivals based on reading of stars.

 Mumbai: Unwind at the end of a tiring day with a classical Bharatnatyam performance. Priya Venkatraman, a disciple of Guru Kanaka Srinivasan, performs at the India Habitat Centre on March 23. The show time is 7 pm. Passes are available at the desk.

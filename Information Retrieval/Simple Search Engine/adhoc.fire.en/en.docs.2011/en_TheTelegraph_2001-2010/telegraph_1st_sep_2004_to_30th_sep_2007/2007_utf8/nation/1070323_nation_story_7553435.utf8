 Mahajans wife breaks down 

 Mumbai, March 22 (PTI): Rekha Mahajan, the wife of slain BJP leader Pramod Mahajan, broke down in court today while giving her statement on the sequence of events on April 22 the day her husband was allegedly shot by his brother Praveen.

 I went to the bedroom to get Pramods clothes when I heard phut phut (shots fired), Rekha said as she burst into tears on the witness stand.

 She fainted after she was helped into a chair and a doctor was called in.

 Pramod Mahajan died on May 3, 2006, after battling th-ree bullet wounds for 11 days.

 Rekha, who was questioned by special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam, said when Praveen came home on the morning of April 22, only she and Pramod Mahajan were at home. Rekha had gone to the kitchen to bring tea when the doorbell rang.

 She said she came out when she heard voices in the living room and realised Prav-een had come over. She then asked him if he wanted teat but he asked for water. Rekha later went to the bedroom when she heard the shots.

 The court, which will continue recording Rekhas statement tomorrow, also examined another witness who had seen clothes found at the scene of the crime being handed over to police.

 The next witness will be the Mahajans domestic help who was present at the time of the incident.

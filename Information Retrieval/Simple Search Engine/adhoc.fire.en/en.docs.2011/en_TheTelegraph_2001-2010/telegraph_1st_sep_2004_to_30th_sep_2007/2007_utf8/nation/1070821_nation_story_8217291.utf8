 Sikh girl to convert for UK school

 London, Aug. 20 (PTI): A Sikh couple in Britain are considering converting their four-year-old daughter to Roman Catholicism so that she can attend their favoured school next month, a leading daily reported today. 

 Maya Kaur has been attending a nursery at St Pauls Roman Catholic School at Wolviston, north-east Britain, for two years. 

 But recently, her parents were told that there was no place for Maya if she wanted full-time education in the school from next month. 

 According to the schools admissions policy, children who have been baptised Roman Catholic or who have a sibling in that institution would get priority. 

 We think Sikhism is similar to Roman Catholicism so we put her in that school. Shes been there for two years, she goes to church with them, she says a prayer before she eats her dinner. Ill baptise her as Roman Catholic so she can go to the school, the Daily Mail quoted the girls father, Bal Singh, as saying. 

 The proposed conversion might be frowned upon by Sikhs, but Singh and his wife Baljit insisted they were doing nothing wrong. 

 Two years ago, when they took her into the nursery, why didnt they say she wouldnt get a place straightaway in the primary school? Singh asked.

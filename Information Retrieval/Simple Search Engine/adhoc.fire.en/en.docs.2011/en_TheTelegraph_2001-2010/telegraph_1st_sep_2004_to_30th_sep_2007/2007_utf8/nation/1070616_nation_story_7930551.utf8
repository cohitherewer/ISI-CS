 Photo shield for rape victims

 Chennai, June 15 (PTI): Madras High Court today banned publication of photographs and details of rape victims in the print media.

 Allowing a writ petition filed by the National Federation of Indian Women an organisation for protection of womens rights a division bench of Justices Dharmarao and S. Palinivelu directed Tamil Nadu police to strictly implement a 2002 order which, among other things, prohibits photographing rape victims.

 According to the July 15, 2002, circular, issued by the director general of police, commissioners of police in cities and superintendents of police in districts were directed to stop women victims of violence being photographed. 

 The instructions shall be scrupulously followed and any deviation will be viewed seriously, the circular said.

 The need to protect the identity of rape victims from media and public glare has been repeatedly emphasised, the circular said, charging the media with indulging in sensationalism while displaying photographs of rape victims. 

 It is easy for the police to stop such photographs being taken, the circular said, adding some police personnel lack sensitivity to abide by basic civil norms. 

 In the petition, the federations general secretary, K. Shantakumari, claimed only a small percentage of rape victims come forward and lodge complaints for fear of being photographed. 

 If women are discouraged by any means from coming forward to file complaints in cases of rape, the culprits will go unpunished and society will suffer in the long run. It will, in turn, affect the moral and ethical standards of society. 

 Plea for media code

 The Rajasthan government has urged the Supreme Court to evolve a code of ethics for the media, which it blamed for precipitating the recent Gujjar violence.

 In its affidavit, the Rajasthan government said the manner in which news channels reported the developments perhaps was also a contributing factor in the widespread violence in places beyond those at which a blockade (bandh) call was given.

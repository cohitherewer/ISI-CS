 Karat test not in capital but in Kerala 

 MANINI CHATTERJEE

 Vijayan, Achuthanandan and Karat 

 New Delhi, Aug. 9: Armed with a set of special guidelines, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat left for Thiruvananthapuram today on an assignment that might prove a lot tougher than choosing the countrys President and Vice-President or railing against the Indo-US nuclear deal. 

 His mission: to put an end to the factionalism that has assumed cancerous proportions in the Kerala unit of the party.

 Over the next four days, Karat and fellow politburo member S. Ramachandran Pillai will convey the central committees special guidelines to members of the Kerala state secretariat and state committee on how to conduct the triennial party organisational elections leading up to the state conference in February ahead of the CPMs party congress in March 2008.

 The aim is to ensure that factionalism is rooted out from the branch level (the lowest unit) itself, party sources said. This weeks initiative is part of a series of largely unsuccessful attempts by the central leadership to contain the indiscipline in Kerala.

 On May 26, the CPM suspended the leaders of the two warring factions in Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan and state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan from the politburo for making remarks against each other in public.

 Although that action was widely welcomed by the rank and file, factionalism has shown no signs of ending. The proxy war between the Vijayan faction and the VS group has, in fact, worsened in recent weeks.

 The chief ministers followers have complained against an interview telecast by the Kairali news channel with a controversial businessman who openly attacked VS. The pro-CPM channel is said to be packed with Pinarayis men. 

 The problem, sources said, is not just an ego clash between two powerful leaders but goes much deeper. The CPM in Kerala has had a history of factional wars quite unlike that in Bengal. In the 1980s, senior leader M.V. Raghavan led a revolt and was removed from the party.

 In the next decade, K.R. Gowri (or Gowriamma) met the same fate, while the bitter war between the party organisation and Citu raged on for years. Although there has been an ideological element in all the factional feuds, the latest Pinarayi-VS battle is seen as essentially a struggle for power.

 In the run-up to the last state conference held in Mallapuram in February 2005, the Pinarayi faction managed to pack party committees, leaving the VS group in the cold. 

 Despite Pinarayis control over the party organisation, Achuthanandans mass base forced the central leadership to revise an earlier decision and allow him to contest the 2006 Assembly elections and make him chief minister.

 But electoral victory did not lead to a truce. Given the long history of factionalism in Kerala, the latest initiative is unlikely to make much of a difference, according to the sources. But Karat, who has made innumerable trips to Kerala since taking over as general secretary in April 2005, is determined to enforce the new guidelines this time, the sources said. 

 In 2005, the politburo intervened only at the last stage when all the branch, zonal and district conferences had already taken place and could not really make much difference, a senior leader said.

 Instead of conducting the usual post-mortem after the state conference, the attempt this time is to intervene at the very start of the organisational elections from next month.

 The politburo will monitor the entire process, not allow factions to operate, suspend or cancel conferences that do not follow norms and send a clear signal that nobody will be spared, he added.

 At stake is the prestige and authority of the central leadership and Karat himself.

 By repeatedly flouting central committee directives, the Kerala unit the biggest of the CPM with 3,41,006 members compared to Bengals 2,90,164 at last count has also eroded the principle of democratic centralism which is the principal organisational tenet of a communist party.

 A peeved Karan Singh may have called Karat the most powerful man in the country for denying him the chance to be President. But as far as the CPM is concerned, Karats real test of power is whether he succeeds in implementing the oft-repeated directive to eradicate factionalism.

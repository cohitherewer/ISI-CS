 Critics in House, BJP bows to bench

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: The Supreme Courts affirmation of Parliaments decision to expel MPs in the cash-on-camera scam has forced even the reluctant BJP to endorse the ruling.

 The BJP had given a dissent note to the five-member parliamentary probe panel that recommended the MPs expulsion. The partys deputy leader in the Lok Sabha Vijay Kumar Malhotra had objected to Parliament taking a decision based on the probe panels suggestion on the grounds that proper procedure was not being followed. Party leader L.K. Advani said the quantum of punishment far exceeded the MPs crime.

 However, party spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad maintained that the apex courts ruling was the final word on the issue.

 No decision has yet been taken on whether the party would expel the MPs. However, one thing I can say with certainty is that none of these MPs would be fielded again by the BJP, said Prasad.

 Prasad defended the BJPs opposition to Parliament expelling the MPs. The BJP has always taken a very serious view of corruption regardless of who is involved. We only differed on the quantum of punishment. But now that the apex court has settled the matter, we welcome the judgment, said Prasad.

 The main issue before the court was whether Parliament has the power to expel its members before their tenure. Todays decision has acknowledged Parliaments supremacy vis--vis judging the conduct of its members. We welcome the judgment.

 Malhotra, who had given the dissent note on the BJPs behalf, suggested that the government draw up guidelines to act on allegations of corruption against lawmakers.

 It is good that punishment is awarded for corruption, but there should also be rules in place to decide such cases, he said.

 The Congress attacked the BJP for suggesting that guidelines be formulated to set in motion a procedure in cases where MPs are charged with corruption.

 According to Congress spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan, the BJP has displayed a partisan attitude by suggesting caveats on the Supreme Courts order.

 BJP does not respect democratic institutions. They are partisan and given to denigrating even the courts, the Election Commission and other constitutional bodies. They have a tendency to not follow orders issued by these institutions, said Natarajan.

 There is no room for further arguments now that the court has said that Parliament alone can take decisions on members whose conduct is not parliamentary.

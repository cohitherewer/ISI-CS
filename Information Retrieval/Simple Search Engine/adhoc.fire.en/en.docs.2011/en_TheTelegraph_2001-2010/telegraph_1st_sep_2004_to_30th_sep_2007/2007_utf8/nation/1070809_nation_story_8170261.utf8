 Brisbane (Agencies): Mohammad Haneef has began his court battle against the revocation of his Australian work visa, with his lawyers dubbing the decision legally flawed as it was based on a misconstruction of the word association. At Brisbanes federal court, they said the fact that Haneef was related to suspects in the failed UK bombings was not enough to show he was of bad character.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Vision 2020 in last speech too

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 24: A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today gave a thanksgiving speech to the country instead of a farewell address in his last public broadcast as President. He demits office tomorrow. 

 Kalam recalled his encounters with children and men and women from across the country to highlight that everything bright and beautiful made his tenure a time of joy. 

 But his vision of India in the year 2020 a theme that dominated almost every one of his public speeches dominated his last address also.

 Kalam has also set a tough example for his successor to follow as the supreme commander of the armed forces. 

 He recalled that he touched base in Kumar, an army post above Siachen Glacier at a height of 17,000ft, spent a night in the INS Sindhurakshak submarine and flown in the Sukhoi 30 Mki, the most modern fighter aircraft of the Indian Air Force.

 Yet, he said, one of his most moving moments was when Anukriti, a little girl from a Haryana village, asked him during a visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020. 

 Kalam said the question shows how much the youth and children of the country want to live in a developed nation. 

 Such yearning was also reflected, Kalam said, during his visit to Nagaland in 2002 when the tribal council of Khuzama village used its enhanced financial powers to increase fruit and vegetable production. But the village was not well connected. This, he said, illustrated how difficult it would be to transform 6,00,000 villages of the country. 

 The outgoing President repeated what he told in Parliament yesterday. India, he said, should be a nation that is one of the best places to live in and is proud of its leadership.

 Stumped NDA advances meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 14: The NDA will meet on June 16 to chalk out its strategy for the presidential polls after the UPA announced Pratibha Patil as its candidate. 

 The talks were earlier scheduled for June 18, coinciding with the third fronts meeting to take a view on the elections. The Opposition camp was caught off guard by the UPAs surprise choice. 

 After Pratibhas name was declared this evening, Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat was reportedly less than enthusiastic on a contest, but his supporters egged him on and urged him to stay in the fray. 

 The picture changed dramatically in a day. In the morning, Shekhawats home had been buzzing with the activity of his supporters. By evening, when the UPA candidate was known, the mood turned gloomy.

 A source close to Shekhawat said the veteran leader would listen to his inner voice before deciding whether he should contest or withdraw. Shekhawat is too senior a BJP leader to be told what to do, the source said. 

 It is likely that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will invite the BJP and other parties, like the Samajwadi Party and the Telugu Desam, for a consensus on Pratibha.

 Singh will hope that the NDA shows the kind of regard that the Congress had shown in 2002 when it supported A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the NDAs candidate, a source close to the Prime Minister said. 

 The NDAs stance will depend on how the situation develops. What this means is that the alliance may not field a candidate against Pratibha if the third front does not back its nominee, or if parties like the Shiv Sena decide to back her to honour regional aspirations.

 The fears appeared to be coming true. The Sena, which has 21,590 votes in the electoral college that picks the President, dropped hints it may favour Pratibha. If it sticks to this stand, the NDAs votes will be over a lakh less than what the UPA-Left-Mayavati combine will command. This will be true even if the NDA gets the third fronts backing.

 The BJP did not comment on Sonia Gandhis choice of Pratibha, but tried to play up the divisions within the Congress. 

 Senior party leader Vijay Kumar Malhotra said: The UPA has not enhanced Pratibhas prestige, but only insulted leaders like Shivraj Patil, Pranab Mukherjee and Karan Singh. The Congress itself floated their names but has now come up with a different nominee.

 Pratibhas name has been announced at a time when the BJP was reaching out to smaller parties to drum up support for Shekhawat as an independent candidate. 

 Today, BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi met Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Ajit Singh. He also held discussions with Shard Yadav of the Janata Dal (United). Later, Naqvi briefed former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on his talks with the leaders.

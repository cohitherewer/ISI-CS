 Mumbai, April 18: The guards at Aishwarya Rais apartment block had orders to keep intruders out but obviously that didnt apply to Abhishek Bachchan.

 So, as the six-foot-two frame with the familiar designer stubble got off the white Merc and strode coolly into Le Mer, the security men saluted respectfully.

 The barricaded-out photographers, marvelling at their luck, clicked away furiously. The young man in grey jeans, the black blazer showing off his broad shoulders, took no notice as he stepped into the lift, bouquet in hand.

 The romantic groom breaking with tradition to get face-to-face with the bride a day before the wedding? It was too good to be true and so it turned out to be.

 Devi Singh Rajpurohit of Rajasthan used his resemblance to Abhishek to fool the Bachchans security ring and the citys seasoned paparazzi to get within metres of Aishwarya today.

 The man had arrived in Mumbai six months ago hoping to find a job as Abhisheks double in an industry teeming with actors look-alikes doing roles in films, stage spoofs or TV shows.

 He apparently had little luck till he pulled off his big stunt which, unconfirmed reports said, had landed him a contract with a TV network before the day was out.

 Rajpurohit had driven his rented Mercedes right up to the main entrance of Le Mer, also Sachin Tendulkars home. But in his excitement, he pressed the wrong button on the lift panel, for the 11th floor, thus heading for Tendulkars apartment. He quickly realised his mistake and pressed eighth floor.

 He wouldnt have expected to take in Aishwaryas family, anyway. As soon as he stepped out of the lift, her brother Aditya called his bluff.

 Surprised that a look-alike had managed to breach the security cordon, Aditya began questioning him.

 Rajpurohit told him he merely wanted to leave the flowers for the bride. Aditya refused the bouquet and instructed security to take the man down.

 Rajpurohit wouldnt mind that. He knows that doubles only get to do the stunts; its the hero who gets the girl.

NATION BRIEFS

 New Delhi, March 9: The Congress moved closer to sewing up its alliances in Uttar Pradesh after a meeting the Amethi MP, Rahul Gandhi, had with rebel Samajwadi Party MP Raj Babbar today, says our special correspondent. 

 Party sources said the Congress will, in all likelihood, fight 250 of the 403 seats in the Assembly polls and leave the rest for its allies. Among those who have more or less come on board are the Jan Morcha, spearheaded by V.P. Singh, of which Babbar is a prominent leader. The Jan Morcha includes the CPI and the NCP. 

 Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal is the other party which is likely to go with the Congress. Although Ajit has demanded 85 seats, Congress sources said efforts were on to get him to scale down his expectations and settle for something more reasonable.

 Rupnagar (PTI): A local court on Friday framed charges against Parkash Singh Badal in a disproportionate assets case a week after he took over as Punjab chief minister. Charges were also framed against his wife Surinder Kaur, son and MP Sukhbir Singh Badal and seven others.

 Maharajganj (PTI): Two persons, one a police constable, have been arrested and a police official suspended in this Uttar Pradesh town in connection with the detention of 12 Nepalese girls who were allegedly being taken illegally to the Gulf. 

 Dehradun (PTI): Uttarakhand MLA Kishore Upadhyays briefcase went missing from the Assembly on Friday. It contained important papers and money. I have lodged a report in this regard with the secretary, Vidhan Sabha, Upadhayay said.

 Leopard dies

 Jammu (PTI): A leopard was beaten to death in a village in Udhampur district. The animal attacked a man on Thursday night. Villagers rescued him and beat up the animal with sticks and stones. The injured man has been hospitalised.

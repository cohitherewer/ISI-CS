 Burden of 29 deaths

 - Crash blamed on shop repair that damaged pillar 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Mumbai, July 20: Kailash Jain isnt talking any more.

 Lying at his home in Borivli, where Wednesdays building collapse killed 29 people, he is in tears, unable to come to terms with the charge that he was responsible for the deaths. The victims include his wife and daughter-in-law.

 Kailash is the owner of Vardhaman Jewellery, which was on the ground floor of the Lakshmi Chhaya wing that gave way.

 The jeweller is accused by his neighbours of damaging one of the buildings main pillars during renovation in his shop. The pillars supported the weight of the 25,000-litre water tank on top of the collapsed portion.

 Kailash has been charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder (Section 304 of the IPC), negligent conduct (in pulling down or repairing buildings) and endangering the life or personal safety of others. 

 But what has been lost in the heat of the charges is that Kailash, like his many grieving neighbours, is mourning the loss of wife Kanchanben and daughter-in-law Kusum.

 Kusum was among the dozens trapped under the debris who had tried to contact relatives from their cellphones. 

 She called several times. I was out at that time, says a family member, tears streaming down his face. 

 Kailash himself had a close shave. He managed to scamper out in time, but his wife, hobbled by a foot injury, could not.

 The tension in the family is inescapable. Madan Jain, a relative, refused to allow journalists to meet Kailash saying he is in a troubled state.

 He has a heart ailment and is in a sensitive state. Hes not even speaking to us, how will he speak to you? He has lost his loved ones, too. Please leave him alone, Madan said.

 The illness appears to have also softened police, who have not arrested him so far. 

 We have registered a case against Kailash for carrying out illegal structural changes that might have resulted in the collapse. We have postponed his arrest until the last rites (of his relatives), said assistant police commissioner (north) Suresh Khopde.

 His shattered neighbours dont have much sympathy. To them, Kailash remains the man responsible for the deaths of their loved ones. 

 The bitterness might be greater because in 2001, Kailash and other shop owners on the ground floor had not allowed repair work to be carried out. 

 Two wings of Lakshmi Chhaya had been renovated then. Residents believe that if Kailash and the others had allowed the repairs, Wednesdays collapse would not have happened. 

 No permission

 Officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said no permission for structural repairs had been given to the housing society. It now appears that the six shops on the buildings ground floor had lowered their plinths and reduced the size of the main pillars to increase their area without clearance.

 The civic body has set up a technical committee to probe the collapse. 

 The six-storeyed building had two wings, with 12 flats each. The ground floor had 28 shops. The BMC had issued the occupancy certificate in 1980.

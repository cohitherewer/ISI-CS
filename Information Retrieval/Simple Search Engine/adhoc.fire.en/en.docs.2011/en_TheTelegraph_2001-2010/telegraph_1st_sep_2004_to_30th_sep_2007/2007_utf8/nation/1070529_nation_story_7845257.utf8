 Howrah bar fiend shoots pursuer 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 28: A bystander was shot dead after he pursued the gunman who picked a fight in a bar over eve-teasing in Howrah tonight.

 Amit Singh alias Jharkhand opened fire on Suren Singh, 28, who joined the chase on National Highway 6, better known as Bombay Road.

 Along with two friends, Amit had teased a girl in the bar, which led to heated arguments with the employees. 

 The suspected gangster soon took out a pistol from his pocket and shot at the bars security guard. Amit then ran out and tried to start the car in which he and his friends had come but it overturned. 

 He started running with many on his heels. Suren, who was outside the bar, too, started chasing Amit, who turned around and shot him.

 Suren was rushed to West Bank Hospital, where doctors declared him dead.

 By then, a police patrol van had joined the pursuit, triggering a shootout. As bullets flew, Amit, an assistant sub-inspector and a constable were injured. Amit was eventually caught and admitted to hospital along with the two policemen.

 One of Amits companions was found behind bushes and beaten up. The third man escaped.

 We knew that anti-social activities go on in the hotel. We have arrested some hotel staff members. Investigation is on, the Howrah (rural) superintendent of police, Satyajit Banerjee, said.

 Pickpocket

 New Delhi, Aug. 28 (PTI): Delhi High Court has asked an alleged pickpocket to pay up Rs 5,000 after she asked for criminal proceedings against her to be quashed because a compromise was reached with the complainant.

 The accused was caught stealing a purse and an FIR was lodged.

 The petition for quashing of the FIR is nothing but an abuse of the process of law and deserves to be dismissed with heavy costs, the court said.

 Refusing to quash the criminal proceedings, it said: It is very rare that pickpockets are apprehended red-handed.

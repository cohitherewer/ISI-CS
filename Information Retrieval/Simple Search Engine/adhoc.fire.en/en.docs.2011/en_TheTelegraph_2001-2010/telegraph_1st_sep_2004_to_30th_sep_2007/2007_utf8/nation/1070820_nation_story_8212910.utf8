The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Hyde ties down neither US President nor India: Congress

 SANJAY K. JHA 

 New Delhi, Aug. 19: The Congress believes that the storm over the Hyde Act is uncalled for and unjustified. The Left has said its concerns go far beyond the Hyde Act, which terminates cooperation if India carries out a nuclear test again, and it is worried about Indias growing relations with the US.

 In an exclusive interview with The Telegraph, Devendra Dwivedi, Congress Working Committee member and former additional solicitor-general, explains the partys stand.

 Q: Do you think the differences between the Left and the Congress are fundamental and cannot be sorted out? 

 A: The differences have to be viewed in their totality and not in isolation. The thrust of the Left and even other parties has been that the deal must ensure conformity with the assurances given by the Prime Minister repeatedly in Parliament. He has delivered on his assurances. 

 The two other objections that have now surfaced relate to the implications of the Hyde Act on the terms of the agreement and whether the deal is a step in a direction which will impact our independent foreign policy. The first objection is inherently flawed and the second is unrelated to the deal and, therefore, extraneous. It is ideological in nature which has no relation with the realities of the basics and the direction of foreign policy. 

 Q: Why does the Congress feel that the Hyde Act is not an overriding factor? 

 A: The whole case on Hyde Act stems from a basic conceptual obfuscation. The fears are a result of an unfamiliarity with the scheme of the American Constitution, which is based on separation of power, and there is also a basic difference between law-making in the US and in a parliamentary system like India.

 America has a system of divided government where national power is split between Congress and the President. In a parliamentary system, the cabinet is part of Parliament and answerable to Parliament and every piece of legislation is introduced and authored by the cabinet. Every provision of a law is formulated by the government and the government is fully bound by the law which it gets enacted by Parliament.

 In America, the President is neither part of Congress nor answerable to Congress. As a result, a legislation is the exclusive domain of Congress, in the making of which the President has no role, except to the extent of his veto power.

 Many of the laws, therefore, have two parts; one which is binding and central to the purpose of the law and the other which is advisory in nature. This part is in the form of a wish list of different lobbies and represents a compromise between different interests.

 The President, even if he belongs to the same party which controls Congress, often disregards those provisions. This conflict is especially reflected in the area of foreign policy, which is the exclusive domain of the President and in which Congress has a very limited role.

 Since the Second World War, successive Presidents have consistently asserted their executive privilege and disregarded congressional homilies on the advisory part of the law. A constant struggle for preserving their respective turfs has, therefore, become a source of ongoing conflict between the President and Congress. 

 The Hyde Act has to be viewed against this background. While giving his assent to the Hyde Act, President George W. Bush unambiguously asserted that sections like 103, certain parts of 104 and several other provisions are advisory and not binding.

 The relations between nations are state to state. If one were to go through several laws which contain prescriptions vis--vis relations with Russia and China and if they were to follow the logic of the Left parties, they should have hardly any dealings with America.

 They are, however, mature nations and conduct the relations on an executive-to-executive basis. Besides, the 123 Agreement has been signed after the passage of the Hyde Act and in several respects the provisions have sought to practically modify those of the Hyde Act and offset their effects.

 It should be kept in mind that under the supremacy clause of the American Constitution, international agreements and treaties are the supreme law of the land like the Constitution is. There is no question of the terms of the 123 Agreement being subservient to the Hyde Act.

 The entire case against the deal on the basis of the Hyde Act has been built upon sand, the Hyde Act is the concern of the President and applicable to America. 

 Only acts of the Indian Parliament and the international agreements entered into by elected governments enjoying majority support in Parliament are binding on India. 

 The 123 Agreement is the deal which is more favourable to India than the 123 deal between the US and China which even refers to good conduct of China being a factor to be taken into account. 

 Q: But what after President Bushs exit and the possible arrival of another less favourable President? 

 A: There is a broad consensus and bipartisan support to Americas foreign policy and, in the past few years, a very strong consensus has emerged which cuts across the political divide. This reflects a feeling that the American policy towards South Asia has been flawed and there is a need for widening Americas relations with India in view of the countrys emergence as an important economic power, regional power and a key player on the world stage. 

 I cannot visualise a situation when a future President will deviate from this. 

 Q: But can the Congress party satisfy the Left on the charge of being a junior ally of the US? 

 A: Critics will do well to remember that the Congress has laid the foundations of Indias foreign policy and given it content and direction. The Congress has defined Indias national interest. It itself is a guarantee for an independent foreign policy. The Left parties should have greater faith in institutions of Indian democracy and our democratic processes.

 Marriage of superbrands

 Mumbai, April 20: Unlike the Liz Hurley-Arun Nayar wedding bash, theres no talk of the Bachchans having sold the rights to the AbAash wedding to a high-street glossy. But that doesnt make the marriage any less lucrative.

 Subtlety has always defined the private and traditional family, but the windfall from and for the brands that ride on the Bachchans isnt quite a secret.

 Ad industry strategists say the Bachchan brand, seen to be valued around Rs 750 crore earlier, has skyrocketed after the marriage was announced. The Bachchan brand will be around Rs 1,000 crore once Ash joins the family, says Prahlad Kakkar, adman and the actresss neighbour.

 While the Big B stole the show in endorsements last year, with 41 brands, Ash topped the list among women with 17, according to Adex, a unit of TAM Media Research. 

 Abhishek, with 12 brands, took the fifth position among actors. The senior Bachchan and his daughter-in-law also have the highest visibility among stars in daily commercials.

 The industry is abuzz with speculation about the kind of brand premium the family may command films and product endorsements after the wedding. To sign them together, a brand manager or a company would have to pay a fortune. But taking all three would be a waste of money for a brand as one wouldnt be able to do justice to the amount paid. Together, they may be powerful, but very expensive. So the package deal seems a bad idea, said the head of a top advertising firm. 

 But, with pockets getting deeper and good ideas in brand promotions hard to find, theres hope for the threesome. A pointer to this came in a recent forecast of the ad firm JWT, which put Aishwarya among the 70 individuals who will make an impact in 2007 with their brand image. Industry leaders say not only will her marriage into the Bachchan family enhance her own brand value, it will also push up Abhisheks by a few notches. 

 LOreal is already putting a lot of money on her lucky lips. The Paris-based cosmetics major introduced a special lipstick for her wedding, its first such launch. The company has also dolled up the bride on her big day.

 A jewellery brand endorsed by Aishwarya has lined up a special wedding collection. An FM channel Abhishek promotes will give away his wedding sherwani to a lucky listener. Lux and Motorolas campaigns are built around the two after their wedding announcement.

 But the cherry on the cake could well be the honeymoon destination. AbAsh are besieged with offers from the most exotic locales, free of cost, of course. Ireland tourism wrote to the Big B offering to gift a honeymoon to the couple. Australia and Switzerland are in the race, too.

 Consequences whip in Left hand

 Karat: Political wisdom

 New Delhi, Feb. 18: The CPM politburo today warned the Congress to weigh the consequences of unilaterally sacking the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in the face of opposition from some allies within and outside the UPA.

 We are hoping the government will consider all the consequences before it takes any decision to impose Article 356, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said.

 Raj Bhavan or Delhi cannot decide the issue of majority. It can be only decided on the floor of the House.

 The CPM believes the Centre should junk thoughts of ousting Mulayam not only because of its opposition but because the Congress may not electorally gain by doing it. It feels that toppling Mulayam would turn him into a martyr and he would stand to gain in the Assembly polls.

 Karat and colleague Sitaram Yechury have met Congress leaders Pranab Mukherjee and Kapil Sibal and conveyed their reservations.

 Karat suggested the Congress might not go ahead with its topple plan given varying degrees of opposition from allies the DMK, NCP and the RJD. We have no information on it.

 He said the DMK and Lalu Prasads governments had been dismissed through Presidents rule. There are two parties in the UPA which want to scrap Article 356. We want the Centre to amend it to prevent any misuse, he said.

 In spite of Karats claims, the DMK only said it was keeping its fingers crossed that the Congress would not take any hasty step.

 We hope the Congress will take a good decision, party chief M. Karunanidhi said after speaking over phone to Sonia.

 Lalu Prasad, too, has been inching towards the Congress on the issue. The CPM is likely to talk to him.

 At present, the Centre needs a simple majority in both Houses to endorse Article 356. Endorsement of Presidents rule should be by two-thirds majority in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, Karat said.

 The Centre should serve a seven-day notice to the state government before dismissing it. The governors report, which has become the blueprint for dismissal, should be subject to judicial review and public scrutiny, he said.

 Mayavati threat

 BSP chief Mayavati has threatened to launch a statewide anti-Congress agitation if the Centre continues to dilly-dally on sacking the Uttar Pradesh government.

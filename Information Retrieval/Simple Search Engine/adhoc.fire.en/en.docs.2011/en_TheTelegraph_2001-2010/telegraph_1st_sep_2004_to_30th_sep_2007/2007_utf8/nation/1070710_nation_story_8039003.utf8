The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Red alert for ADMK

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 9: The CPM is ready to break bread with all but one party in the third front, the ADMK.

 Indications to this effect came in a party report that suggested the CPM would do business with the Samajwadi Party, Telugu Desam and Asom Gana Parishad. 

 The three are key partners of the eight-party front. The report did not name the ADMK, or its partner MDMK. It was merely silent on them.

 In Tamil Nadu, the CPM is a partner of the ruling DMK.

 Haneef leak puts cops on backfoot 

 Brisbane, July 22: Mohammed Haneefs lawyers have accused police of leaking damaging allegations to make the Indian doctor look guilty.

 Two newspapers today cited unnamed government sources as saying that images were found on Haneefs laptop of a building and its foundations near where he lived in Queensland. Police were investigating whether Haneef was involved in a plot to carry out a terrorist attack on the Gold Coast, the report said.

 If the AFP (Australian Federal Police) and prosecution have any evidence on which they purport to base these serious allegations, they should provide copies of that evidence to Dr Haneefs solicitors, Haneefs lawyer Peter Russo said.

 The police had refused to confirm or deny the report.

 But after Russo lashed out, AFP commissioner Mick Keelty issued a statement saying the report was inaccurate. We will be taking the extraordinary step of contacting Dr Haneefs lawyer to correct the record, he said.

 Haneef, 27, is charged with supporting a terrorist organisation because he gave his cellphone SIM card to a second cousin who is a terror suspect in Britain. He was granted bail by a magistrate who saw no direct link between the doctor and the terror plot he was charged with supporting. But the government blocked his release by cancelling his visa and ordering him detained.

 His lawyers claim the case against Haneef is extremely weak and accuse the police and the government of selectively leaking information that makes him look guilty.

 The two newspapers reported the police were looking at documents that referred to destroying structures and had information that Haneef was allegedly one of a group of doctors who had been learning to fly in Queensland. 

 Russo described the report as fanciful.

 What do the Prime Minister, the attorney-general and the commissioner of federal police think about this latest form of conducting trial by media? Russo asked. 

 The government has come under immense pressure after crucial evidence against Haneef was found to be false and inconsistencies were revealed between what he had told police and what the court was told. Media reports have said Canberra is now thinking of deporting the doctor to save itself more embarrassment. 

 But in Bangalore, Haneefs wife Firdous Arshiya said: I maintain I dont want him to be deported. I want him to be cleared of all the charges. He has to come out clean. 

 Imran Siddiqui, a cousin of Firdous who is in Brisbane to support the doctor, spoke to a crowd of supporters today. Ive come to take him back hes innocent, that I know, he said. Its not wrong on my part to expect that he should be released with all respect and dignity.

 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR 

 Shimla, Jan. 19: Cheque in hand, Bali Ram never felt poorer.

 The 65-year-old has been returned Rs 135 on the Rs 100 his father had put in a 1954 central government scheme that was to mature in 10 years. His father, Nath Ram, who went around collecting land revenue in the hills, died in 1962, two years before his investment was due to mature.

 In April last year, a relative chanced upon the Government of India receipt that had been issued to Nath Ram. It was lying unnoticed in a corner of the house. A letter was sent to the Reserve Bank of India to return the money, along with interest. The family was asked to hand in the receipt, but only Rs 135 was returned even 52 years after the amount was invested.

 The struggle for the family from Chiwana village, 100 km from Shimla, didnt end there. 

 To encash the cheque, Bali Ram needs a savings bank account. And, it takes at least Rs 500 to open a new one. That seems like fantasy for the below-poverty-line family. 

 Since his father passed away, Bali Rams economic condition went from bad to worse. At the same time, the economy has grown manifold. 

 Nath Ram had made the investment on a call from Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru, whose government had been struggling with empty coffers. Honouring the nations call, my father had invested Rs 100 under the National Plan Loan Scheme. But the government has failed to return the money with interest (from 1964 to the day the cheque was issued), says Bali Ram.

 We do not have a bank account. The Reserve Bank has made a mockery of our investment by sending us a cheque of Rs 135. Those days the value of Rs 100 was much higher than today, he says.

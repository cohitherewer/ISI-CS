The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Warships get ready for rare tryst, Left marshals forces for anti-US drill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Sept. 3: Warships from five countries were about to rendezvous for the largest multinational war games in Indian waters tonight even as the Left ratcheted up its protests against Indias growing strategic alliance with the US.

 The naval exercise, named Malabar 07-02, will begin early tomorrow with the Indian Navys Visakhapatnam-based Eastern Fleet commander, Rear Admiral Robin Dhowan, hosting his counterparts and other officers onboard the aircraft carrier INS Viraat, and in the Unified Command headquarters in Port Blair for the final planning conference.

 The most complex multinational war games in Indian waters will be held between the east coast and the Andaman Islands. 

 The leaders of the CPM and the CPI, Prakash Karat and A.B. Bardhan, will also begin rallies from Calcutta and Chennai that are due to converge in Visakhapatnam on September 9, the final day of the war games. 

 Campaign material to be distributed by the Left run into five folders containing posters and pamphlets in many languages. It will be distributed along the routes taken by the jathas led by the two leaders.

 The nuclear deal is part of a much larger programme in which India is to become a partner in the US strategic vision, reads one of the CPMs pamphlets. 

 This deal should be seen as a part of the Manmohan Singh governments attempt to integrate India more closely with the US. 

 A majority in Parliament was against the deal but by refusing to accept the majority view, the government sends a message which is harmful for Indian democracy, a pamphlet titled Dont Proceed with the Nuclear Deal says.

 But undeterred by the political protests, the navy has gone ahead with the planning of the exercise since it was first mooted in October last year. 

 We intend to utilise every minute of the five-day exercise to the fullest. This is a rare opportunity and we want to make the most of it, an officer at naval headquarters said.

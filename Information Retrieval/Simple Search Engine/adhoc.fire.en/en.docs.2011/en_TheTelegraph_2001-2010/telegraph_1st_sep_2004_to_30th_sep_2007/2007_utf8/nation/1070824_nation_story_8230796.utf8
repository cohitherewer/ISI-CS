 Freed, time for a long drag amp; battle

 ANANYA SENGUPTA 

Pune/Mumbai, Aug. 23: Free after 23 days, Sanjay Dutt tried to blow away his worries in smoke. The first thing the actor did after getting out of the Yerwada jail this morning was light up.

 Friends had started gathering at his Bandra home from 6am, over an hour before the actor appeared at the jail gates wearing a beard, short-cropped hair and a smile of relief finally free three days after he was granted interim bail.

 I have a long battle to face, please pray for me, Dutt told reporters outside his house as sister Priya wiped her tears.

 Colleague and buddy Salman Khan will also be in need of prayer tomorrow when the court hands its verdict in the chinkara case. A conviction could send him to jail. 

 At Yerwada, shouts of Sanju baba had gone up as Dutt came out at 7.16am in a striped shirt and faded jeans. The actor obliged policemen who had crowded to shake hands with him, even hugging those he recognised, before he got into a Tata Sumo that raced to Lohegaon airport 4km away.

 A chartered flight and short drive later, Dutt was home. Namrata and Priya rushed to hug their brother, who scooped up little nephew Siddharth and planted a kiss on him before heading inside. 

 He returned later as promised, having changed into a T-shirt, to address the media. 

 In all humility, I thank all those who prayed for me during this period of my life. I thank all those who stood by me and my family and supported us so firmly.

 I intend spending this brief period while Im on bail working on my case with my lawyers, Dutt said. 

 The freedom could last even less than a week if the Tada court hands its order on August 27 as promised the actor will then have to surrender and seek regular bail.

 But Farhana Shah, who is on Dutts legal team, thought it might take longer. It will take at least a month for the court to hand over the copy of the judgment to us. After that, Sanjay has to surrender and spend some time in jail, and we can apply for fresh bail.

 The actor refused to comment on films he would work on in the interim but trade experts said he might try and finish the promotionals and patchwork for some of his unfinished projects. 

 Lawyer Satish Maneshinde, who had reached Yerwada at 5.45am, said the actor would concentrate on the legal battle. There is a lot of work that needs to be done. But as of now, all of us are resting. Sanjay wants to be with his family. 

 Friends Apoorva Lakhia, Bunty Walia and Sanjay Gupta and brothers-in-law Kumar Gaurav and Owen Roncon had been waiting for Dutt at home. Later, producer duo Abbas and Mustan also dropped in.

 Dutt, who thanked his family, friends and the film industry for their support, did not forget the fans who had missed him because he was released early in the morning. 

 I thank all my fans in Pune who stood outside the jail waiting for me. Im sorry I could not meet you all but thank you for your prayers. I was overwhelmed by your love. I could hear you when I was inside the jail, and your love kept me strong.

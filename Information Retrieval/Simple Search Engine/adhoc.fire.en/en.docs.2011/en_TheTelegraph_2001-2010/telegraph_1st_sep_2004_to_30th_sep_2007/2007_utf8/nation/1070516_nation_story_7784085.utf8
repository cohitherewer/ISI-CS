 NDA ball in Atal court

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Vajpayee: In the fray? 

 New Delhi, May 15: The NDA today dipped its feet in the President poll pool, authorising Atal Bihari Vajpayee to take an appropriate decision at an appropriate time on the nominee.

 Mamata Banerjee did try to create a splash by proposing the former Prime Ministers name for President. 

 L.K. Advani said the decision should be left to Vajpayee, who kept mum, and the alliance decided to meet after four or five days to pick up the thread again.

 Mamata sprang the surprise when someone asked why A.P.J. Abdul Kalam should not get another term.

 A source close to Mamata quoted her as saying while Kalam had a great innings, if Vajpayee was fielded, there would be heavy cross-voting because Vajpayeeji is not a politician any more, he is a great statesman. 

 After the meeting at Vajpayees residence, Mamata and George Fernandes left for the Janata Dal (United) leaders residence for more consultations.

 Sources said the NDA would not reveal its hand in a hurry.

 Within the BJP, a section felt that as in 2002, when the Congress kept everyone guessing until the NDA zeroed in on Kalam and decided to back him once the Samajwadi Party pre-empted it, the party should wait for the UPA to unfurl its plans.

 If there is a candidate like Kalam, who could facilitate a process for consensus, the NDA would strategise accordingly.

 Others in the BJP favoured a contest and proposed fielding Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. 

 However, the counter-view was that a political heavyweight like Shekhawat should not be subjected to a defeat in the sunset of his career.

 After the humiliating performance in the Uttar Pradesh elections, the BJP has lost the chance to gain a numerical advantage.

 Besides, the party cannot bank on Uttar Pradeshs two big players, the BSP and the Samajwadi Party. Mayavati has conveyed through her interlocutors to the UPA that she might support a Congress candidate but with certain conditions.

 Political logic had it that if Mayavati went one way, her rival Mulayam Singh Yadav would look the other way. But that is not an open-and-shut case, given the perception that the Samajwadis secular moorings may not permit it to openly do business with the BJP. 

 Another view in the BJP was that if a contest was forced on the party, it could be turned into a symbolic one, knowing well that numbers were against the NDA.

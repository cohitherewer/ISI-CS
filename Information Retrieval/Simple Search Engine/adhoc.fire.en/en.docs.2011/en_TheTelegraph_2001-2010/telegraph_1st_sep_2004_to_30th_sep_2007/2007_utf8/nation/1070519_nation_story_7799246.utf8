The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bengali Bardot in Cannes

 Cannes, May 18: Cannes doesnt often get beauty and Bengali combined in one. But it happened today when Bipasha Basu, looking her loveliest, landed in Nice.

 She was swept an hour later to the Salon Diane of Hotel Majestic to meet the worlds media, talk about her new film Goal alongside co-star John Abraham and lend support to Ronnie Screwvala, the chief executive of UTV.

 Wearing a silver blue sari which bared as much as former icon of Cannes, Brigitte Bardot but in different places she was happy to give more time to The Telegraph than to the others: I would love to speak in Bengali.

 The Telegraph upbraided Bipasha for turning up in Cannes five years too late for she should have come in 2002 when leggy pictures of Jism were put up in the Cannes market.

 Screwvala showed a three-minuter from Jodhaa Akbar, which he predicted would be the biggest release of 2007. The film, which stars Hrithik Roshan as Akbar (in his slim line days) and Aishwarya Rai as his Rajput lover, Jodhaa, is being directed by Aushutosh Gowariker, who had wanted to come to Cannes. But he decided to stay back and finish the shoot ahead of the approaching monsoon.

 Screwvala also announced that a new version of UTVs big earner, Rang De Basanti, would be released for the western market, re-edited and reduced in length from two hours 50 minutes to two hours 10 minutes. He screened another three-minuter from the renamed movie, The Colour of Sacrifice, which depicted the cruel Brits stringing up fine upstanding Indians.

 The British journalists, sipping their red wine, maintained a discreet silence.

 Abraham, who nowadays affects a woolly hat, said things were changing in Bollywood. Someone with a name and a face such as his was now accepted by the industry.

 I am from Calcutta I have to be, began Bipasha.

 Goal is about an Asian who finds fulfilment when he leaves an English football club and switches to an Asian one in Southall. Abraham claimed he did all his own dribbling and clever shots even though he conceded India, 151st in world rankings, was not very good at the game.

 Speaking of her own role playing a Pakistani girl in Goal (comparisons with Gurinder Chadhas Bend It Like Beckham will be inevitable), a film set entirely in the UK, Bipasha said: I play a girl called Rumana. She is the sister of the captain of the Southall (football) team that is played by Arshad Warsi. The film is about the people trying to keep the club going so that they dont lose their land, basically. But because they are very poor, they are not able to do that.

 She continued: They have small professions somebody runs a restaurant, somebody is a butcher, everybody is from humble professions. They need a team medic and Im the team medic. I am a medical student in the film. They have no money so they decide to hire me as their team physio. This a serious film but she gets the lighter moments. She is funny, a little bit crazy, she is a bubbly young girl.

 Bipasha said she knew the UK well but on why this was her first visit to Cannes, she commented: Last year, I was supposed to be here for Omkara but I missed it because I was in London and shooting for another film of mine, Mr Fraud, so I couldnt make it. I was trying to fit it in.

 She went on: This year also its so funny, Im shooting every day in Yashraj (studios) and John and all came yesterday, and I could not take out the time. I said last minute no, I dont think its going to be possible, and then I requested, Let me just go for a day, at least. Ami next year emni aste chai (next year, I want to come just like that), just to see the films, just to hang out, the vibes great. Next year for sure!

 She said she would perform at next months IIFA ceremony in Yorkshire. 

 Films are changing drastically from the time I did Ajnabee till now. I dont think I would have remained an actor if the films were not changing because the stereotypes are gone. There used to be a very typical Indian actress which is not there any more. There are no boundaries to an Indian actress now. You can have any kind of woman, you know.

 Today, Cannes rather fancied the Indian woman it saw.

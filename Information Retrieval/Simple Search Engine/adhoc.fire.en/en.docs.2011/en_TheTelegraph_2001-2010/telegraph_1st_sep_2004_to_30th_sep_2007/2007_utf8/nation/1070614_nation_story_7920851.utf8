 SC seal on Maya throne 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mayavati

 New Delhi, June 13: Mayavati can sit back and relax on her heartland throne.

 The Supreme Court today threw out a petition that had challenged her appointment as Uttar Pradesh chief minister on the ground that she hadnt resigned as a Rajya Sabha MP before taking oath.

 The court clarified that an MP could become a state minister and hold on to the post as long as he or she is elected to the state legislature within six months.

 The bench, headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat, said there is nothing in the Constitution which says it is illegal to appoint as chief minister or minister a person who is not a member of a state legislature.

 The petitioner, Ashok Pandey, had argued that the appointment of Mayavati and her colleague S.C. Mishra was unconstitutional as they hadnt given up their seats in Parliament.

 The Uttar Pradesh-based lawyer said the Constitution permits a person who is not a member of a state legislature to become a chief minister or a minister and get elected to the House, but there is no such provision for MPs.

 But Justices Pasayat and P.P. Naolekar, who cited several earlier rulings, said there was no embargo on an MP becoming chief minister.

 The court pointed out that the absence of the expression from amongst members of the legislature in Article 164(1) indicates that a non-member can be appointed chief minister. The only restriction, the judges added, was that he or she has to be elected to the state legislature within six months, as stated in Article 164(4). 

 The bench recalled that nearly 60 years ago, B.R. Ambedkar had opposed an amendment brought by a member of the Constituent Assembly who wanted a provision to be incorporated to ensure that only a member of a legislative Assembly or council could be made a minister.

 The judges said Ambedkars reasoning was such a provision would shut out competent persons though they might have been defeated in an election.

 In view of what has been stated by this court in the aforesaid decisions, the inevitable conclusion is that this petition is sans merit and deserves to be dismissed which we direct, the bench said while rejecting Pandeys petition.

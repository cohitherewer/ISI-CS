 Guruvayur gates open a crack

 The entrance to the Guruvayur temple

 Thiruvananthapuram, June 13: The Guruvayur temple board today apologised to Union minister Vayalar Ravis son, Ravi Krishna, for ordering purification rituals after he worshipped at the shrine on May 18, signalling that age-old entry restrictions are being relaxed.

 Ravi Krishna had taken his son to the Krishna temple for the christening ceremony, marked by a formal rice-feeding, along with family members. The authorities had let him in after collecting the prescribed fees for the ceremony.

 The next day, however, the priests carried out a cleanup of the temple on the ground that the son of the overseas Indian affairs minister is a non-Hindu because his mother Mercy Ravi, a former Congress legislator, is a Christian.

 Board president Thottathil Ravindran said Ravi Krishnas certificate shows he is a Hindu. Nowhere does it show he has been baptised. Therefore, there is no substance to the priests latest prescription, citing a similar purification ceremony in 1997 after Ravi Krishnas marriage at the temple.

 Chenas Raman Namboodiripad, the main priest, had abstained from the two-day meeting of the board, which decided to apologise.

 Both Vayalar Ravi and his son said they were satisfied with the decision.

 But Ravi Krishna also said: This is not enough. This should not happen in future. I would like to know how the board is going to rein in those people who say they would do the same thing (purification) if I revisit the temple.

 To discuss such issues, especially the larger question of opening up the temple to all believers irrespective of their religion, the board today decided to soon convene an assembly of Vedic pundits and legal experts.

 The decades-old row over entry at Guruvayur centres on famous singer K.J. Yesudas, once barred at the gate while his guru, the late Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar, was let in for a concert. But the guru walked out and sang the whole night with his disciple outside the temple.

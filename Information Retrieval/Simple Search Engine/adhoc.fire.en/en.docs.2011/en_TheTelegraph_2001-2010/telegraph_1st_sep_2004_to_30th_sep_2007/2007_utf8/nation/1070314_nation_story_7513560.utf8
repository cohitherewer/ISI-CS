 Lean period air charge

 New Delhi, March 13 (PTI): The Centre today said it might offer incentives during lean periods to reduce airspace congestion over major airports.

 There is no decision yet on whether to charge more during peak hours. But we have to find ways to optimally use the airport capacity and infrastructure throughout the day, especially during the non-peak hours, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said.

 Patel today met top officials of leading airlines in the wake of opposition to a proposal to hike airport and navigation charges during peak hours.

 A committee, headed by civil aviation secretary Ashok Chawla and tasked to recommend steps to de-congest airspace during peak hours, had recommended increasing the charges during morning and evening hours at Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore airports.

 The airlines, under the banner of Federation of Indian Airlines, sought continuation of exemption from the tax for leasing aircraft or engines from foreign sources.

 On private airlines taking a congestion charge of Rs 150 per ticket, Patel said though the government did not interfere in pricing, I dont favour it. 

 Kingfisher Airline chief Vijay Mallya said Delhi High Court has issued notices on the surcharge. We will reply to the notice, he said.

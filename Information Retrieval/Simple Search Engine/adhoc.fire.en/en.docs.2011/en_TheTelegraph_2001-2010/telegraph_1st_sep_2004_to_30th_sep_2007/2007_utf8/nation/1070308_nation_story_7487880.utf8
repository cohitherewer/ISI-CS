 Vikas plea to contest UP polls

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 7: Vikas Yadav, an accused in the Nitish Katara murder and convicted in the Jessica Lal killing case, has sought permission from the Supreme Court to contest the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.

 Vikas, who is lodged in Tihar jail, can contest only if the Supreme Court stays the conviction in the Jessica Lal murder till the decision on his appeal. The son of former Rajya Sabha MP D.P. Yadav was found guilty of destroying evidence by Delhi High Court and sentenced to four years in jail.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan today issued a notice to Delhi police on the application filed by Vikas who has relied on the recent apex court order in Navjot Singh Sidhus case.

 The court will take up the matter on March 19 before the last date for filing nominations on March 23.

 Even if the court stays his conviction in the Jessica Lal case, Vikas will have to remain in jail as he is facing trial in the Nitish Katara murder case where he is the prime accused.

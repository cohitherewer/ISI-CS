 Minority plea

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: The National Commission for Minorities wants the Centre to help reconstruct the religious buildings destroyed in the Gujarat communal violence in 2002.

 The commission will soon recommend to the UPA government that necessary financial assistance be extended to non-government organisations for the job, sources said.

 The move comes after the BJP government in Gujarat turned a deaf ear to the panels repeated requests, the sources added.

 In the riots that rocked the state for months after the Godhra train fire, 526 mosques and other Muslim shrines were either partly or completely destroyed.

 Of them, 294 have already been reconstructed or repaired, but without any assistance from the state government despite chief minister Narendra Modis promise of financial aid in the wake of the violence.

 The commission has already started identifying NGOs in Gujarat that can take up the responsibility of reconstructing the remaining 232 religious buildings. It wrote to some organisations a week ago.

 The sources, however, pointed out that the project would require a considerable amount of funds, and the NGOs might not be able to manage on their own. Financial help from the Centre would, therefore, be necessary, they added.

 The minorities commission had first written to the Modi government on April 8, 2002, and several times after that. But the only response it got was a letter dated September 9, 2006, which only tried to mislead the commission, the sources said.

 The panel them wrote back to the state government mentioning the hollowness of the point made in its letter, they added, but refused to elaborate on what had misled the commission.

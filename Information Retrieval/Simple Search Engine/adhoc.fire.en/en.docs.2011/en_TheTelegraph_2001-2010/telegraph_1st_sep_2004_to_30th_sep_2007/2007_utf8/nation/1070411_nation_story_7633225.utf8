The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Ouch! 2 out of 3 kids beaten in school

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

New Delhi, April 10: In the land that spawned the guru shishya parampara, children in school dont just receive education they also get punched, pinched, slapped, and whacked with rulers, sticks and rods by the very teachers they are taught to respect. 

 Nearly two out of every three children across India are victims of corporal punishment a euphemism for physical abuse of schoolchildren a nation-wide study released yesterday has shown. 

 The worst affected are children in Assam. Practically every student in the state 99.56 per cent reported being battered by teachers. 

 While some had wounds to show us, many were still so traumatised that they would suddenly go completely silent, as though reliving a horror, when asked whether they had faced corporal punishment, said Rajneesh Kumar, a researcher working with Prayas, the NGO hired by the Centre to do the ground work for the study. 

 Compared to schools, homes appear somewhat safer for children when it comes to physical abuse 53 per cent of the 12,447 children, between 5 and 18 years old, questioned said they were beaten at home. 

 The situation is reversed when it comes to sexual abuse fewer children who go to school have reported sexual assault than children who dont go to school. 

 That (physical abuse) is one of the major problems we are grappling with. On the one hand, we want to universalise elementary education and are encouraging parents to send children to school. But physical battering is a deterrent against children to go to school, Loveleen Kacker, joint secretary in the ministry of women and child development and the officer in charge of the study, told The Telegraph. 

 It doesnt help that some of the worst violations of child rights occur right under the nose of the government researchers say several government institutions, including schools, are indifferent to the concept of child rights. 

 Bengal, for instance, has a lower incidence of physical abuse in schools overall 55.56 per cent as compared to the national figure of 65.01.

 If one considers the schools run by the state government though, the figure for Bengal leaps up to a shocking 85.5 per cent. 

 Rajeev Haldar, executive director of Prayas, blames the lack of transparency in government-run institutions from schools and child shelters to public sector units for the crimes against children carried out here. 

 Government shelters are simply not made available for scrutiny, even to eminent civil society groups, he said. 

 Children working as cleaners or vendors in violation of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Protection) Act at railway stations are particularly vulnerable to physical and sexual abuse, he said. 

 In a bid to think out of the box to tackle corporal punishment, the ministry plans to rope in teachers unions. 

 We have to identify people the teachers will listen to. Thats where teachers unions can come into the picture for us, Shanta Sinha, chairperson of the recently set up National Commission for the Protection of the Child, said.

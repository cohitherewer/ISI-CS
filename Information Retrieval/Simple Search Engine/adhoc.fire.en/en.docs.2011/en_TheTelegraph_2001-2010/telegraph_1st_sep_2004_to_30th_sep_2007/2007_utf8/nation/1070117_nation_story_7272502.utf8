 People power to beat Ulfa

 OUR BUREAU

 Jan. 16: Delhi is banking as much on the surge of anti-Ulfa sentiments in Assam as on military operations to rein in the banned militant group, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh revealed today.

 Ulfa has resorted to shameless and gruesome acts of terror and there will be no compromise with these groups if they resort to violence. At the same time, I would like to reiterate that the doors for dialogue are open to all disaffected groups, including Ulfa, who are willing to abjure violence, Singh said at Mohanbari Airport in Dibrugarh. 

 He said Myanmar has promised to extend all possible help to Delhi in evicting militant groups of the Northeast from its territory if there is specific information about their camps on its soil.

 Singh said the offer of help from the junta came directly to him. Only yesterday (Monday), I had a talk with the premier of the Myanmarese government and apprised him about the situation which we are facing. He assured me of all possible help in uprooting terror camps in that country. 

 Singh said several delegations from Assam had met him in New Delhi since Ulfa started targeting Hindi-speaking people and asked for stern steps to restore peace.

 Surveys are repeatedly showing that there is absolutely no support in Assam for acts of violence and terror People want to get on with their lives and improve their lot rather than be victims of fear and terror, he said.

 Ulfa began killing Hindi-speaking people the very day the outcome of a survey in nine districts it showed that only a minuscule section supports Ulfas campaign for sovereignty was announced.

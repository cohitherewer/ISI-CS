 London, May 29: The designs of the uniforms which will be worn by Yorkshire hostesses at the International Indian Film Academy awards ceremony in Sheffield on June 9 were disclosed today.

 The designs are the work of Sheffield-born Lena Malik who now lives in Rotherham and runs a successful fashion and beauty business catering to the changing needs of the modern community and are inspired by her love of Bollywood. 

 I was raised surrounded by Bollywood culture, enthused Lena.

 The full-length gown, predominantly green in colour to reflect Yorkshires countryside, is a fusion of East and West. 

 Lena explained that she has used a western cut and fused it with eastern embellishments to add strength and character, with one half sleeve and one sleeveless arm balanced by a baazu band around the forearm. The simple clean lines of the gown are given a touch of real glitz with crystal encrusting to the shoulders, sleeve and forearm. The result is sophistication, red carpet glamour with a twist of simplicity. 

 She added: In the late 70s, my grandfather and father owned the only Hindi cinema in Sheffield. So you could say my affair with Bollywood spans many years. As a direct result of the cinema, my family and I have come to know many locals in the community with whom we have developed very close relationships over the years; a factor that proves time and again to be the point of success for my business. 

 Yorkshire hostesses representing the partner cities of York, Leeds, Sheffield, Hull and Bradford will wear her outfits at the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) awards ceremony in Sheffields Hallam FM Arena. 

 The Yorkshire Tourist Boards chief executive, David Andrews, said: When designing the outfits, it was very important we have a designer who not only lived and worked in Yorkshire, but who understood that our models had to be confident in the clothes. After all they will find themselves under the gaze of global TV audience of over 500 million people. 

 Neil Jenkinson, the head of culture and major events at the Yorkshire Forward, the development agency for the UKs largest county, said: Its important that industry moves with the times. A great deal of our regions wealth was built on textiles. This is an example of how a company can adapt techniques and design for the new markets emerging in todays culturally dynamic society. 

 The bid for the IIFA Weekend Yorkshire 2007 was undertaken by the Yorkshire Tourist Board, with the support of Yorkshire Forward. IIFA is expected to bring 28,000 visitors to Yorkshire in June 2007 and generate 10 million from direct tourism spending.

 An estimated 100 actors and actresses, led by Amitabh Bachchan and including some of the biggest names in the business (Bipasha Basu and Englands darling Shilpa Shetty) are expected to arrive in Yorkshire, Sabbas Joseph, director of Wizcraft, the management and branding company on the Indian side, revealed to The Telegraph today. 

 Some of the Bollywood celebrities are threatening to play a cricket match which might even be umpired by Dickie Bird. It will be recalled that Sachin Tendulkar made history when he became the first overseas player to play for Yorkshire way back in 1992.

 Sidelined colleagues do Gujarat cop in

 Ahmedabad, April 30: D.G. Vanzara was nailed by some sidelined fellow officers who were waiting to get back at the chief ministers blue-eyed cop.

 Highly placed police sources said because of the political patronage, Vanzara acted on his own and showed scant regard for superior officers like inspector-general P.P. Pandey, who headed the city crime branch.

 The sources said Vanzara took direct orders from home minister Amit Shah, bypassing his immediate superior Pandey, who was not even kept in the loop during sensitive operations.

 So while Vanzara often crowed about his proximity to Modi and Shah, other senior police officers like Kuldeep Sharma, S. Khandwawala, Shamiullah Ansari, Satish Verma and Satish Sharma were shunted to insignificant posts.

 Smarting under the humiliation, the officers waited for their chance. 

 It came when Sohrabuddin Sheikhs brother Rubabuddin filed a habeas corpus petition in the Supreme Court regarding the mysterious disappearance of Sohrabuddins wife Kauser Bano.

 While probing Kausers disappearance, state CID (crime) IG Geeta Johari had come across evidence pointing to the involvement of Vanzara and two other IPS officers arrested in connection with the fake encounter that killed Sohrabuddin in November 2005.

 Some senior officers advised Johari to send a copy of her report to the state governments counsel in the Supreme Court K.T.S. Tulsi and Hemantika Wahi. 

 Coming from the head of the state CID, the government counsel mistook the report as the state governments official position and presented it to the Supreme Court, the sources said. Johari could not be contacted to verify the claim.

 Once the state CIDs report found its way to the court, the state machinery could do little to hush up the matter.

 By then, the CID had already arrested Vanzara and the two others Rajkumar Pandian and Dinesh Kumar.

 The Modi government is, however, putting up a brave face.

 It has started justifying the killing of Sohrabuddin as an essential step to curb anti-national activities. 

 State BJP workers are distributing pamphlets dubbing Sohrabuddin a terrorist who owed allegiance to Pakistan.

 Beijing offers a glimpse, shakes up summit

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 New Delhi, April 3: Beijing set the cat among the pigeons at the Saarc summit inaugural today by offering to hold a workshop on contemporary China for South Asian diplomats and establish a cooperation mechanism on poverty alleviation with member nations.

 Chinese foreign minister Li Zhaoxings speech was received with tight-lipped silence from Indian diplomats, some of whom privately pointed out that if Saarc did not get its act together, offers such as these from observer nations would increasingly be par for the course.

 US observer Richard Boucher, the assistant secretary of state for South Asia, was not allowed to speak. Saarc foreign ministers had decided yesterday that only those observer nations who had sent their foreign ministers would speak.

 So the speeches only came from Li of China, Taro Aso of Japan and Song Min-Soon of South Korea.

 Japans candidature as observer had been pushed by Delhi along with that of the US in the past year as a move to balance the presence of China, whose candidature had become a bone of contention between India and Pakistan at the last Saarc summit in Dhaka in November 2005. 

 Taro Aso said his government was advancing an initiative to create an arc of freedom and prosperity and hoped that cooperation with the Saarc nations would be in line with this.

 Eurasia had seen many historic transitions, the Japanese foreign minister pointed out, and now a new frontier had emerged. It is a growth region, more stable than ever. He added that Japan would offer certain sums of money to promote connectivity, via infrastructure, and disaster preparedness, especially in earthquake-prone areas.

 But it was Lis speech that truly sparked off an undercurrent of interest. Suddenly it seemed as if a somnolent Saarc was being stirred and shaken, all at the same time.

 Apart from discussions with Saarc nations on establishing a mechanism on poverty alleviation, Li said, China was ready to host a workshop for officials from the member countries on the subject.

 China, the rising world power, seemed to be clearly showing off its economic status, and enjoying doing so, an analyst said. 

 Given the countrys abundant human resources, Li added, China would invite Saarc nations to attend a multi-lateral training programme and would consider hosting bilateral training programmes. 

 Energy and infrastructure were key areas, Li said, insisting that all cooperation would be on the basis of equality and for mutual benefit. Beijing proposed to institutionalise the China-South Asia Business Forum, he said, while it encouraged Chinese investment in Saarc nations.

 Koreas foreign minister made no bones about the countrys interest in Saarc as a trading bloc. Direct investment in the region, Song said, amounted to $1.4 billion, an average increase of 23 per cent, while two-way trade had reached $11 billion.

 Terror link on Pak table

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: India has decided to place on record the Pakistani connection to the Mumbai train blasts in the forthcoming meeting on a joint anti-terror mechanism, despite lacking strong evidence to establish it, reports our special correspondent. 

 Sources in the home ministry said that by placing all the evidence they have on record, India would at least be able to use it for future reference. 

 The Indian team, headed by K.C. Singh, additional secretary in the foreign ministry, will place the material, including the chargesheet, mobile records, reports of narco-analysis tests of those involved and the addresses of Pakistani persons divulged during interrogation. 

 Besides Singh, the team will comprise two other high-level officials the joint secretary in the home ministry, L.C. Goyal, and a senior officer from the Intelligence Bureau.

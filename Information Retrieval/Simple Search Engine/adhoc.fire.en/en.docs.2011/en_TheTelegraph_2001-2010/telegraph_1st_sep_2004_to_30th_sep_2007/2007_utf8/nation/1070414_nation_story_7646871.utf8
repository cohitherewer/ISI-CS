 Easy US visa plea

 Washington, April 13 (PTI): A US business federation has urged lawmakers to reform the immigration system to allow corporate America to employ more foreigners and retain its competitive edge.

 The US Chamber of Commerce said the current system of H1-B visa popular with Indian professionals and EB (employment-based or green card) programmes are counter-productive to the countrys economic, security and social goals.

 The H-1B visa programme allows foreign scientists, engineers and technologists to be employed for up to six years in the US, at the end of which they must obtain permanent residency or return home. 

 The fact that the H-1B visa cap for the FY2008 was reached on the first day applications were accepted marks the dire need for changes in the system, the federation said.

 The inability of these companies to bring highly educated workers and students into the US hurts their competitiveness in the global market and often leads to companies moving operations overseas.

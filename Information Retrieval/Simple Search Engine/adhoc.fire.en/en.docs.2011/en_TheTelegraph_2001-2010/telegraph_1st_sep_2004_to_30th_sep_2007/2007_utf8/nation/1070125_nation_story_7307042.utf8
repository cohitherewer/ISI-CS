 Kabul, Jan. 24: Afghanistans entry into Saarc makes the case for free movement of goods among South Asian countries stronger. 

 Pakistan now has to respond not in words but in action, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee said here today after discussions with the Afghan leadership. 

 Mukherjees remarks come after talks with Afghan President Hamid Karzai yesterday and with Afghan leaders from political parties and the government. The talks included the issue of transit of Indian goods over land through Pakistan to Afghanistan. 

 Apart from the issue of transit, Mukherjee said the talks also covered Pakistans restrictive trade practices despite being a signatory to the South Asia Free Trade Agreement (Safta). With Afghanistans membership of Saarc, said Mukherjee, the process of integration of Saarc is complete and Afghanistan will automatically become a member of Safta. 

 In its trade with India, Mukherjee pointed out that Pakistan has a positive list of 1,073 items. India expects the restrictions on the number of items that can be traded will be lifted by Islamabad. 

 Mukherjee said Afghan leaders briefed him on their perceptions of peace and security and cross-border terrorism. The Afghanistan government is very worried by the resurgence of the Taliban, he said. He added this issue figured prominently even in last Novembers deliberations on the economic reconstruction of Afghanistan at a meet hosted in New Delhi. 

 They (the Taliban) are operating from the (Pakistan-Afghanistan) border areas and they are getting infrastructural and logistics support. It (checking the Taliban) is the responsibility of Nato.

 Mukherjee said India was continuing to demonstrate its involvement in the economic reconstruction of Afghanistan by hiking assistance to the embattled country by $100 million to $750 million. 

 A substantial portion of the funds would go towards building an electricity transmission line that would supply power to Kabul and the Zaranj-Delaram Road connecting Afghanistans arterial Garland Highway with the Iranian port in Chabahar that is being built by the Indian Border Roads Organisation. 

 The Indian governments contributions and Mukherjees deliberations through yesterday are also a not-so-subtle message to Islamabad that New Delhi was not abandoning its projects in Afghanistan in a hurry despite death threats to Indians working on them. 

 Like Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit in August 2005, Mukherjees first visit to Afghanistan, too, has had to contend with a frustration of efforts by Islamabad to allow transit, particularly when it wants to set the tone for the Saarc summit by saying its theme is connectivity.

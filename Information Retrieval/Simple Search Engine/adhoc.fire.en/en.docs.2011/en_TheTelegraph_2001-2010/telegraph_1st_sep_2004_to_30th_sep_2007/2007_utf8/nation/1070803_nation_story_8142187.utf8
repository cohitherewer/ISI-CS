 New Delhi, Aug. 2: Finally, Calcutta can claim it sets the nations agenda.

 Heavy rain drowned parts of Delhi and paralysed traffic in several areas as the national capital got a taste of what the Bengal capital has long experienced the cold, wet feel of waterlogged streets.

 The Met office said the city recorded 184.6mm of rainfall since last night.

 The downpour came as a relief after days of sultry weather the maximum and minimum temperatures dipped by six and three degrees Celsius but busy intersections like ITO, Minto Bridge, Nizamuddin Bridge, Dhaula Kuan, Hauz Khas and industrial areas like Okhla reported traffic snarls.

 I had to wait for over five hours at the Dhaula Kuan crossing while on my way to office, said Anju Sahu, who works in a private firm.

 Control rooms of the municipal corporation received nearly 200 complaints of waterlogging.

 The maximum number of complaints 30 came from the Shahdara (south) zone, while the central zone was a close second with 28.

 The weather office has forecast more rain: intermittent showers with a few heavy spells.

 A release issued by the civic body said a boy, who had gone out for a swim with a friend, was swept away in the Ramesh Nagar area.

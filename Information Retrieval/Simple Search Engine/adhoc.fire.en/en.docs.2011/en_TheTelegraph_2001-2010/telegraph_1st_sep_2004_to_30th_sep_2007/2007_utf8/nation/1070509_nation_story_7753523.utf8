 Husain breather

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 8: The Supreme Court has stayed a Hardwar court order directing attachment of artist M.F. Husains properties.

 Husain is charged with outraging religious sentiments with his paintings.

 An apex court bench today stayed the order while issuing a notice on a plea by the artist to transfer the case from Hardwar to Delhi. The transfer petition will be heard later. 

 Husain, it is believed, sought the case to be transferred on the ground that his life is under threat. 

 Last year, the apex court had transferred to Delhi four similar cases registered against him in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.

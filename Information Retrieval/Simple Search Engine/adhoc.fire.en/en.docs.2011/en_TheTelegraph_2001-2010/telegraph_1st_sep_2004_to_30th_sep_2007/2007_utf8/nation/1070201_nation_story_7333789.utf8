 Jinxed copter set to return

 A Dhruv helicopter

 Bangalore, Jan. 31: Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) is overcoming initial setbacks to equip Dhruv, its advanced light helicopter meant for the army and navy, for a flight of revival as a weapon-wielding flying machine.

 The indigenously designed and produced choppers were grounded for eight months after a crash triggered by a malfunctioning tail rotor. Touted as a multi-role, multi-mission and an all-weather advanced light helicopter, Dhruv hopes to bridge the operational gap in the army and navy that has been felt for several years. 

 Engineers at HALs helicopter division are busy with tests on the ground and in the air. We are fixing weapons and running sorties. I am sure by the end of this year, the naval variant will be ready for approval, said C.D. Upadhyay, chief test pilot of HALs rotary wing. The choppers meant for the army will take longer as these have to be fitted with a wider range of equipment.

 Upadhyay said HAL and Frances Turbomeca are jointly developing an advanced engine, called Shakti, which is being fitted on to the twin-engine Dhruvs. 

 We hope to get Shakti certified by the French authorities by the year-end and by Cemilac, the Indian authority that certifies military flying machines, immediately after it. We plan to fit this engine to 14 helicopters, he said.

 The engine has been specifically designed for Dhruv, but very few of its key components are made at the state-owned firm. 

 Sources said the companys component unit will be scaled up to produce more of these spares.

 The Shakti engine will enable the chopper to fly and fire weapons from high altitudes 7 km above the ground. 

 All controls are digital in the fully integrated glass cockpit. A map-reader makes it easier for the pilot only one, though there are dual controls to fly on missions.

 The naval version is more complex as helicopters are attached to the mother ship and cannot operate in a stand-alone environment.

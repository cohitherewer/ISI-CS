 US team for babu tone-up

 New Delhi, Jan. 6: Senior bureaucrats might be sulking but they cannot escape a three-phased training programme that seeks to teach them the technique of better governance the American way.

 The government order for the 1979 batch joint-secretary-level IAS officers has made it clear that every officer must go through the training if he wants to get empanelled for the senior post of additional secretary.

 The programme, which started at the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad on January 2, was the brainchild of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and had been given shape by an expert committee headed by academician and former minister Y.K. Alagh.

 Three US universities offering courses in governance and leadership Harvard Universitys John F Kennedy School of Government, the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University and the Duke Center for International Development at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina have been roped in to work in partnership with three Indian institutions IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Bangalore and the Tata Energy Research Institute (Teri).

 The primary aim of this first-ever official mid-career training programme, estimated to cost Rs 45 crore, is to help senior bureaucrats develop next-level competency in the complex, changing world of policy-making. They will be trained by faculty from the US universities along with the Indian institutions.

 Most of the bureaucrats going to IIM-A are, however, not necessarily happy with the programme they have been asked to go through in the 27th year of their service.

 Governance in the Indian situation is different and unique. What we learn in the course of extensive on-ground experience as SDMs and DMs definitely cannot be taught by any foreign university, said a bureaucrat from IIM-A.

 Even if the Kennedy School of Government wants to preach us governance through Fighting corruption in La Paz (Bolivia), a case study by Ronald MacLean-Abaroa, it wont help us as the Indian scenario is different, he added.

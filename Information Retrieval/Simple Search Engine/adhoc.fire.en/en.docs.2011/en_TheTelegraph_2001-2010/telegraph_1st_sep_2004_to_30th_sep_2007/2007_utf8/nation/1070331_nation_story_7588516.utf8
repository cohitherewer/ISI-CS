 Jammu killings

 Jammu, March 30: Militants gunned down five labourers and wounded four in Rajouri district late last night, reports our correspondent.

 Chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad described the incident as a gory glimpse of what happens when troop withdrawal is demanded without giving a thought to the situation on the ground. 

 It is a lesson to those calling for demilitarisation, Azad said in a veiled attack on his alliance partner, the Peoples Democratic Party.

 Around 11 pm, four militants, suspected to be activists of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, stormed into a tin shed housing road construction workers in Baglar and opened fire indiscriminately, inspector-general of police S.P. Vaid said.

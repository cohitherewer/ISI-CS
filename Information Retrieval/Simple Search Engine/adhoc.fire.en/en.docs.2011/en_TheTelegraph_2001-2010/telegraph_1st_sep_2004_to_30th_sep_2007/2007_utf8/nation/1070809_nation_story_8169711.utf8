The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Its us or them, Pawar tells players

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: The Board of Control for Cricket in India today cautioned former and current cricketers against joining any other organisation.

 Without naming the breakaway Indian Cricket League (ICL), the board said anybody choosing to associate with any other organisation would stand to lose all benefits from the board.

 Every individual has a right whether he wants to associate himself with the BCCI or any other organisation, a two-line statement, issued after a meeting in Sharad Pawars house, said.

 However, if he chooses to associate himself with any other organisation, he will not derive any benefit or be connected with any of BCCIs activities in any way.

 The statement marks another flip-flop by the board on the multi-million dollar breakaway league. Last week, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah had threatened to ban for life players aligning with the rebel body. Yesterday, Pawar had claimed there was no confrontation between the two.

 Today, board officials did not take any question on the ICL. Board vice-president Rajiv Shukla said: Anyone is free to pursue his interest but the statement is very clear.

 Asked if the statement was an attempt to discourage the boards affiliated units from renting out their facilities to the ICL, he declined comment.

 Treasurer N. Srinivasan said cricket grounds did not belong to the board. It is up to the associations to decide.

 Srinivasan denied that the statement was a veiled ultimatum to former India captain Kapil Dev, who has joined the ICL. He said any decision on individuals would be taken at the boards special general body meeting in Mumbai on August 21.

 The boards tough stand could make it difficult for the ICL, financed by Zee boss Subhas Chandra, to hold its proposed Twenty20 matches in six Indian cities in October-November.

 Azad terms for troop cut 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Jammu, March 27: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad has told the Centre he would recommend a reduction in troops only if all parties give him a written undertaking backing the move.

 The message was sent after a meeting with Congress MLAs this evening where Azad insisted troops couldnt be cut merely on the slogans of one particular party. Later, the legislators adopted a resolution that said the views of all parties in the state should be taken into account before such a recommendation is sent to the Centre.

 Arguing that terrorists were still staging attacks, Azad made it clear that no decision would be taken in haste and that the security of the people was his overriding concern.

 The three-page statement spelling out the chief ministers stand highlighted the dangers of terrorism and the way the things were being projected in a one-sided fashion. 

 I stand by what I said in the legislature. Troop cut will be recommended only after all parties unanimously give me in writing that such a step should be taken, Azad said.

 The PDP, the Congresss partner in the government, wants the reduction in security forces.

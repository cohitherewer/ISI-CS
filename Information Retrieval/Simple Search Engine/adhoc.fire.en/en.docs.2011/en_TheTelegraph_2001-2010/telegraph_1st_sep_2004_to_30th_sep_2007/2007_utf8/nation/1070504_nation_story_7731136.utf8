 Army for probe nod

 Srinagar, May 3: The prosecution of Kashmirs fake-encounter accused has hit a hurdle at a time the spotlight is focused on Gujarats killer policemen.

 The army today claimed the courts cannot try its officers accused in the Ganderbal killings without the Centres sanction, reports our special correspondent.

 A police probe in the murder of Molvi Showkat Ahmad Kataria, one of the five people killed and passed off as foreign militants, had nailed five army officers, five policemen and a cleric.

 State advocate-general Altaf Naik denied that central sanction was required. The court has asked the state to come up with its objections at the next hearing on May 18.

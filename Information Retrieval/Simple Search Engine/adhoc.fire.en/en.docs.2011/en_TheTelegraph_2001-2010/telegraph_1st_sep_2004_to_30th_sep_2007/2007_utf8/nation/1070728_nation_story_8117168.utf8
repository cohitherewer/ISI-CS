 Case for damages exists: Lawyers

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 

New Delhi, July 27: Mohammed Haneefs wife Firdous may not be keen to press for an apology from Australian officials but the Indian doctor can claim defamation and seek compensation that could extend up to nearly 1 million Australian dollars (Rs 3.56 crore). 

 Legal experts in Australia and India said Haneef stands a decent chance of winning a suit alleging defamation. 

 He appears to have a reasonably decent case in proving that the authorities acted in a mala fide manner over the period of his detention, human rights lawyer Tim Matthews said from Brisbane. 

 Haneef was charged on July 14 with recklessly supporting the attempted bombings in the UK by handing his mobile SIM card to his cousin Sabeel accused in the plot before leaving the UK in 2005. 

 News reports that emerged later from Australia suggested that Australian Federal Police officers might have tampered with a diary recovered from Haneef. The police later denied this. 

 Haneefs defence had also alleged that Australian police planted stories against their client in sections of the media. 

 If Haneefs solicitors can prove either that his diary was tampered with or that authorities knowingly spread canards about their client, Australia would almost certainly have to pay damages, Australian legal expert Pat Smith said. 

 If his lawyers can prove that the authorities tampered with his diary, Haneef could gain nearly a million Australian dollars in compensation, going by the record of federal courts, Smith told The Telegraph. 

 The damages Haneef would earn if his lawyers were to prove that Australian police planted stories against him would be less, Smith said. 

 Smith, however, disagreed with Matthews on Haneefs chances of succeeding in proving mala fide intentions by the Australian authorities. 

 It is never easy to prove that the state acted in a deliberate, mala fide manner, Smith said. 

 If Haneefs lawyers fail, as Smith said was likely, to prove any mala fide intentions, they can still hope for a lesser compensation package. 

 Gross negligence on the part of the prosecution is the other argument that can win Haneef compensation, Indian Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan said. 

 The case against Haneef was very thin. If his lawyers can prove that the Australian authorities held him for so long without any evidence that he knew the SIM card was to be used in a terror plot, he could be eligible for compensation, Bhushan said. 

 Smith agreed with Bhushan, arguing that Haneef stood a better chance of receiving compensation for his ordeal by utilising this argument. 

 In August 2006, a plane on its way from Amsterdam to Mumbai was escorted back to the Dutch capital by F-16 fighter planes because a group of Indians on board was suspected of plotting a terror attack on the plane. 

 The Indians were released after questioning in Amsterdam and could not press for defamation as European Union terror laws are exempt from any libel laws. 

 Australian terror laws, strengthened in 2004 in the wake of hotel bombings in Bali, Indonesia, are, however, not exempt from defamation charges.

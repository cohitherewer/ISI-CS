 Lanka radar on Delhi table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 9: A high-level meeting chaired by foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee has reviewed security threats after the LTTEs recent air strikes and also considered a Sri Lankan request to post a team of Indian defence officials to upgrade the countrys radars supplied by Delhi.

 Delhi has supplied two Indian Doppler Radars (Indra) for low-level target detection to Colombo free of cost in the last five years. The Lankans now are understood to be interested in the more advanced 3D radar. 

 Both have been developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation and are manufactured by the public sector Bharat Electronics Limited.

 The Indian Air Force is also likely to place more orders for aerostat balloons radar systems tethered to ground establishments to fill up gaps in airspace. India uses aerostat radars in its western and northern borders.

 Todays meeting considered Colombos request that is understood to have been conveyed by the Sri Lankan presidential secretary, Lalith Weeratunga, during a visit to New Delhi on May 6.

 Lanka foreign secretary Palitha Kohona claimed on Monday that the LTTEs air power was a threat to Indian nuclear installations in south India. The Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research is located at Kalpakkam in Tamil Nadu. 

 India was also training the Lankan air force on using and maintaining the radars it had supplied. But an air force source said the Lankan force did not send an adequate number of personnel for training in IAF establishments.

 There have been four air strikes with conflicting reports of success and failure since the LTTE first used its Zlin 143 aircraft on March 26 in a strike on Katunayake. 

 India has willy-nilly got involved at the receiving end of the raids by the Air Tigers. An Indra 2D radar at Katunayake had not worked mysteriously. In another strike, Indian Oil Corporations joint venture storage facilities were targeted.

 Todays meeting was also attended by defence minister A.K. Antony, defence secretary Shekhar Dutt, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon, Air Chief Marshal Fali Major, the chief of naval staff, Admiral Sureesh Mehta, and national security adviser M.K. Narayanan.

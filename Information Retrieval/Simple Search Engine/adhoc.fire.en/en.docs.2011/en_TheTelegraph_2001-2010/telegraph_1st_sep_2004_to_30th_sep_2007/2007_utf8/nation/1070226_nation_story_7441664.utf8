 Hiroshimas story in Urdu

Yeh ek yamdoot ki kahani hai (this is the story of a yamdoot), declares Tanaka Asumi in her clear, accented voice to an eager audience.

 She is one of the 20 students from Tokyo University of Foreign Studies and Osaka University of Foreign Studies who are in the capital to perform plays in Hindi and Urdu. 

 Its my first time in India, and the people are so lovely, gushes the 27-year-old. 

 Hiroshima Ki Kahani was performed on February 20 at Lady Sriram College; and Daulat Ram College saw Ek Yamdoot Ki Kahani, two days later. Performances were also held at National School of Drama on February 23. 

 These girls were amazing. We loved it, said an excited Ragini Krishnan, student at LSR College. 

 Asumi explains that Hiroshima Ki Kahani is about a boy returning from school when an American bomber drops Little Boy. The protagonist, who sees his family burning, becomes a preacher of peace. The second play is about a yamdoot who helps people reach heaven.

 Get a date on the Net

Tongue-tied when it comes to asking the girl of your dreams out on a date? Heres help at your fingertips.

 Flip, or rather click, through Get Dates, an e-book created by Mumbai-based businessman Devang Badiayani, which he claims is a self-help hitching e-bible for men.

 A father of two, the 37-year-old garment exporter says he is eminently qualified to write such a book because of his experience, but doesnt elaborate. 

 Get Dates can be downloaded from getdates.in/ thankyou.htm for $20 (Rs 880).

 Badiayanis homepage says his book will teach men how to approach a woman and exactly what to say to start a conversation without pick-up lines. 

 Read on and master the art of getting a womans e-mail address and phone number in three minutes flat, he promises. 

 Badiayanis book saw the light of day after a four-month labour of love. He decided to write it when I saw these young men in pubs and clubs trying to get attention from women and not succeeding. 

 Condoms for a cause

More and more BPO employees in Hyderabad are skipping work, but instead of cracking the whip, their bosses are handing out free condoms.

 The BPO industry and Apsacs (Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society) have jointly set up condom vending machines in BPOs across the city. 

 One call centre executive said three out of five shuttles come empty everyday to office.

 We felt the need to take care of our youth after office hours, said J.A. Chowdhary, a member of the society. 

 A condom packet is being offered with chips or sandwiches. 

 We offer free condoms in rest rooms and priced ones in the canteens, said G. Ashok Kumar, director of Apsacs.

 BPO employee Sujatha Gowtham is happy with the initiative. I feel the timings are such that such things are bound to happen. It is easy for anyone to become sexually active. Its for the best; at least people will have safe sex. Its a good idea. 

 Screen bomb

A political hot potato is set to explode on screen. Periyar, a film on the late social reformer, is almost ready, days after his statue kicked up a lot of dust in Tamil Nadu.

 The ruling DMK government has given Rs 95 lakh for making the film, described as a political volcano on celluloid, that chronicles the life of the grand old atheist from Erode who gave the states Dravidian movement a new shape.

 Tamil actor Sathyaraj, an atheist himself, plays Periyar while Kushboo has bagged the role of his wife, Maniyammai. 

Delhi: Want to unwind after a hard day in Delhi? How about some soothing Indian classical music. Vocalist Ulhas Telang will perform at the India International Centre auditorium at 6.30 pm on February 27. 

 Ashish Sengupta will accompany him on the tabla and Pandit Jayram Potdar on the harmonium.

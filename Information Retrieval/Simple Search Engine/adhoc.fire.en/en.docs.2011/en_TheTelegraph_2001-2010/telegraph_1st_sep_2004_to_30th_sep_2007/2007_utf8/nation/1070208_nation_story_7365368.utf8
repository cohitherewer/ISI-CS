 Imphal, Feb. 7: Manipur will kick off tomorrow the Assembly election race that would eventually culminate in the battle for Uttar Pradesh.

 In the first phase, elections to 19 seats will be held in Manipur. The rest of the legislators to the 60-member Assembly will be elected during the remaining two phases on February 14 and 23. 

 The shadow of militant guns and the sensitive issues of Naga integration as well as the repeal of the draconian Armed Forces Special Power Act are uppermost on the electorates mind. Militants made their intentions clear this morning by planting a bomb suspected to be targeted at former BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu.

 Security forces detected a 3-kg explosive device at Uchwain, 200 m ahead of the dais in Mayang Assembly constituency, where the BJP leader was heading to address a rally.

 In keeping with chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswamis observation holding election in Manipur is a challenge the election department has made extensive security arrangements for all the 718 polling stations tomorrow. Manipur is going to the polls with the heaviest ever security cover, R.R. Rashmi, the chief electoral officer, said.

 A sharp ethnic polarisation in the state over the Naga demand to integrate contiguous districts with mainland Nagaland has heightened tension in tomorrows election to six seats in the hilly Ukhrul and Senapati districts.

 The influential United Naga Council (UNC), the apex body of the Naga tribes, had sponsored six persons as consensus candidates in the Naga-dominated constituencies, directing other candidates to withdraw. The UNC diktat has remained unheeded so far.

 Punjab will go to polls next on February 13 followed by Uttaranchal on February 21. The result in the three states should be out on February 27. The Uttar Pradesh polls have not been announced yet.

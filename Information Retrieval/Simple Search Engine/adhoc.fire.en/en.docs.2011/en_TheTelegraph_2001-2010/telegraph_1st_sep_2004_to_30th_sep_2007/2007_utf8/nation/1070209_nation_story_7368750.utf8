 Nimbus denies DD live feed 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: Despite the must-share ordinance, Doordarshan viewers didnt get to see todays abandoned India-Sri Lanka one-dayer live.

 The information and broadcasting ministry was mulling legal action against Nimbus Communications this evening for defying the recently promulgated sports broadcasting ordinance, which says private broadcasters have to share the live feed of any event of national importance with Prasar Bharati.

 Nimbus, however, maintained it was not flouting the ordinance, but merely waiting for clarifications from Delhi High Court. The scheduled court hearing on the matter has been pushed to tomorrow.

 As the match began at Eden Gardens this afternoon, Nimbus followed the arrangement on the basis of a high court directive during the India-West Indies series Nimbuss channel Neo Sports aired the match live while DD was fed a transmission at a seven-minute gap.

 Between that hearing and the one scheduled for today, the government hurried through the ordinance.

 Todays hearing was slated to take place hours before the match. But Nimbus lawyers said they had not received a copy of the ordinance and sought an adjournment.

 The hearing was deferred to 2 pm, but the Nimbus counsel had to be in the Supreme Court then. When he returned, it was too late for the judge. The court then decided to continue the hearing tomorrow.

 Prasar Bharati complained to the I amp;B ministry that the ordinance had been defied. We will take action as per the ordinance, an official said.

 Under the ordinance, the government can withdraw uplinking permission to a channel or even cancel its registration. It can also levy a fine of up to Rs 1 crore.

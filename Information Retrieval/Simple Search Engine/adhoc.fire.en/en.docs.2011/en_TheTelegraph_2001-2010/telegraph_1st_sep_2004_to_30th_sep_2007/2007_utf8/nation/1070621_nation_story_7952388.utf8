 Missing Jaya raises murmurs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jayalalithaa, Mulayam

 Chennai, June 20: Jayalalithaa stayed away from the third front delegation that met President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today to urge him to contest for a second term.

 The ADMK chief was to lead the United National Progressive Alliance (UNPA) group, comprising third front leaders, to Rashtrapati Bhavan this evening.

 It was left to TDP boss N. Chandrababu Naidu and Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav to represent the alliance in their meeting with Kalam. Jayalalithaa sent her MPs, Maithreyan and K. Maliachamy, and former Lok Sabha deputy Speaker Thambi Durai.

 ADMK workers said Amma called off her visit as she was indisposed. Others suggested that a days trip to Delhi would have left her too tired for a Madurai byelection campaign she is to attend on Thursday.

 Unconfirmed reports said Kalam had spoken to Jayalalithaa over phone on Tuesday and told her he did not want to contest. 

 So, the ADMK leader might have decided against pressing him further and risking an embarrassment in Delhi.

 But sources said the reasons were more complicated. Apparently, Jayalalithaa does not agree with Naidu and Mulayam on who should lead the fledgling UNPA floated as an alternative to the Congress and the BJP.

 At the meeting of the alliance at Jayalalithaas Chennai home early this week, expectations had run high that she would get the mantle. 

 But with both Naidu and Mulayam keen on the post, the hopes died a quick death.

 Naidu tried to play down the issue, saying the question of leadership would be settled after some more parties, expected to join the alliance, were on board.

 There were also disagreements on the choice of a candidate if Kalam turned down the request to contest, the sources said. 

 Mulayam indicated that the alliance could abstain from voting if Kalam did not agree. But the ADMK chief wasnt happy with the idea.

 The UNPA is also split on supporting Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat because Mulayam and Naidu dont want to upset Muslim voters by throwing their weight behind the BJP leader.

 Visa leveller for Desam chief

 He helped many make a fortune in Andhra. Last week, he had to queue up for a trip to the worlds richest nation.

 N. Chandrababu Naidu, who helped engineer the states infotech boom as chief minister until four years ago, had to wait in a line like a commoner to get a US visa last week.

 Fortunately, the wait wasnt in Hyderabad, where the status slide would be tough to face, but in Chennais US consulate. 

 For the Telugu Desam chief, who recently donned a farmers hat to show he is more than just a champion of infotech, the visa queue must have one of lifes greatest levellers.

 Officials at the consulate, wary after the spate of trafficking and passport scams from Andhra, interviewed Naidu personally. When the times were good, he rarely had to make a physical appearance. 

 Naidu is travelling to the US for the June 26 annual celebrations of the Telugu Association of North America. He plans to raise funds for his party during the visit.

 Cancellation poser for Metro

 Residents of Delhis New Ashok Nagar have filed a petition under the Information Act to unearth the reasons why a Metro station planned for their locality was scrapped.

 The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, which runs a line past the colony, had finalised plans for a station there after a series of letters were written by residents to its chief E. Sreedharan. 

 We have 2.5 lakh people. The number is more than that of localities that have a station. What are the reasons for the change in decision? the residents have asked. 

 There are fears corruption could be a reason. The corporation dismissed allegations of foul play, saying it had to choose between extending a line to the south and building the station. 

 We had Rs 1.5 crore to spend. The extension will help more people, spokesperson Anuj Dayal said.

 Now, shifts at varsity

 For those who return from a long night out on the town and cant rub the sleep off their eyes early in the morning, Mumbai University has a piece of news that they might love.

 Students who miss their morning lectures will be able to attend them in the evening. The universitys shift college concept is to kick off from this academic year.

 Gains from the new system will not be limited to students. The university, too, will save the money and time spent on sanctioning new colleges and expanding existing ones.

 The idea of having shifts was cleared by the universitys academic council last week. Its members said the suggestion was first made by technology whiz Sam Pitroda at the convocation last year. 

 Pitroda had said shifts will help students who work during the day complete their education. 

 Route rush

 The Metros New Delhi station-airport route appears to have hit the fast track.

 Last week, a full-time director was appointed to oversee the progress of this showpiece link. Mangu Singh, who had been closely associated as an engineer in the construction of Calcutta Metro in the 1980s and the early 1990s, will be steering the airport-city centre link. 

 Five global groups have expressed interest in designing and operating the 19-km link for a 30-year period. The project is expected be over before the 2010 Commonwealth games to be held in the capital. 

 The central government is participating in the project by giving land. The investment will be to the tune of Rs 3,800 crore.

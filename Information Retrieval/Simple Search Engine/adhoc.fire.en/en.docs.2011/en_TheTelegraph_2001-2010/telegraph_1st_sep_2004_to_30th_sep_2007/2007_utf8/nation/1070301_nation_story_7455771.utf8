 Focus on extradition, not Q bail

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: The CBI is not likely to contest the bail of Ottavio Quattrocchi but will ask Argentina to send him to India so that he can face trial in the Bofors case.

 The argument for not contesting the bail is that it would not be a good legal strategy under Argentinian law.

 Carlos Guilleremo Daneri, the public prosecutor appointed by Buenos Aires, is likely to handle the extradition case against the Italian businessman. 

 The CBI described him as an able public prosecutor, but has not ruled out the option of appointing another attorney if necessary. Carlos was appointed by the court on February 16 to fight the case on behalf of the Indian government. 

 Superintendent of police Keshav Mishra and director, prosecution, S.K. Sharma left for Argentina today. The agency said the two would be able to file the case on the morning of March 2. The matter is to be heard in a federal court in Misiones province. 

 The officials are carrying with them 300 pages of documents on the Bofors kickbacks case, which include details obtained from Switzerland about Quattrocchis bank transactions. The documents were translated into Spanish at the Jawaharlal Nehru University. The translation of the other case papers would be done by the embassy in Buenos Aires.

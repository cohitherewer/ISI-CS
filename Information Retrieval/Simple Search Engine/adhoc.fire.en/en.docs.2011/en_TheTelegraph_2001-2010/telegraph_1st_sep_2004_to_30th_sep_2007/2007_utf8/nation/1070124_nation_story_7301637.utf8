 Tax raids on Tamil actor and family

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Jan. 23: The income-tax department today raided the premises of Tamil film star-turned-politician Vijayakant, whose fledgling party has pitched itself as an alternative to the main Dravidian parties.

 At least 11 premises related to Vijayakant were searched, including his Chennai residence and a marriage hall housing the headquarters of his party, the Desiya Murpokku Dravidar Kazhagam (DMDK). Residences of the actors close relatives were also raided, sources said.

 As many as 400 personnel conducted raids on 31 premises in Tamil Nadu, sources said. These include swoops on premises belonging to owners of two self-financing engineering institutions.

 A private engineering college near Chengalpattu owned by Vijayakant was also searched. 

 The sleuths, who fanned out in several teams, first swooped on Vijayakants palatial residence in Saligramam in the city, shortly after 9 this morning. The actor reportedly took the raid in his stride and cooperated with the search party. The tax officials also raided Kalyana Mandapam, a building owned by Vijayakant, located on the citys inner ring road.

 Residences of the actors sister and brother-in-law in Chennai were searched, sources said. A private clinic owned by his second sister, Vijayalakshmi, was also raided.

 Almost simultaneously, some of Vijayakants other properties in Madurai, including a rice mill and the premises of a film company, came under the income-tax departments scanner, sources said.

 Officials said several unaccountable documents and accounting books were seized from the premises.

 News of the raid spread when Vijayakant, an MLA from Viruddachalam, did not turn up in the Assembly.

 Separate teams also raided the residence of Jeppiyar, a former ADMK politician and founder of the Sathyabhama Deemed University. 

 Income-tax department officials also swooped on the premises of the Jaya Engineering College in suburban Thirunindravur.

 Patna braces for tax refund test

 Patna: The income-tax department has set the ball rolling for refunds through the electronic clearing system (ECS) and the Bihar capital is only one of two Indian cities chosen for the experiment. 

 Officials in the local I-T department may say Patna was a random selection, a non-metro chosen with a part of Delhi, a metro, but it is also a matter of pride for them that their city has been given the nod over its more illustrious counterparts.

 Under the pilot project that will continue till April, those availing themselves of the service will get refunds within three working days of transmission of the data to the bank concerned. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram launched the pilot project, Refund Banker, in Delhi a few days ago. Tax refunds are as important as tax collection and ECS will help cut down on bank frauds and make tax collection smoother, he had said. 

 Fine for rail pension goof-up 

 Madurai (PTI): The Madras bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal has slapped a fine of Rs 3,000 on Southern Railway officials for tampering with documents to justify non-payment of service benefits to a retired gangman. 

 The bench criticised the officials for non-application of mind and issuing an erroneous pension payment order (PPO) and correcting it later through another order. 

 It quashed the revised PPO that had declared forfeit 17 years of service put in by the gangman prior to 1985. The tribunal directed the officials to recalculate the retirement benefits from his date of induction in 1967 till his retirement in 2005 and pay the benefits.

 BJP glare on mummy law

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: The Left is pondering but the BJP is wondering how the toddler nuclear deal can act independent of a mother law in the US.

 Senior BJP leaders went into a huddle this evening at the residence of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to discuss the floor strategy when the nuclear agreement comes up in Parliament.

 Left sources said they would carefully go over every clause of the 22-page agreement, but one leader eloquently pointed to the dharma sankat or dilemma. If friends in the third front decide to oppose the nuclear deal in Parliament, what will the Left do?

 Early reactions suggested that the BJP as well as nuclear experts are focusing on the relationship of the 123 Agreement with other US domestic laws, such as the Hyde Act 2006 and the Atomic Act 1954. These laws call for termination of nuclear cooperation in the event of a nuclear test.

 It is the height of naivete for people to think that the 123 Agreement can be read separately from the Hyde act. In fact, the 123 text itself says it must be seen in that context, said former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha.

 According to the 123 text, if Delhi conducts a nuclear test in the future and American laws kick in, the US will ensure that other friendly countries step in and provide uninterrupted fuel supplies to the Indian civilian programme.

 Sinha said the Hyde act would supersede the 123 Agreement and, therefore, the BJP retained all its reservations on the UPA negotiations.

 You cannot expect a toddler to overrule his mother, Sinha said, referring to the 123 Agreement and the Hyde act.

 Nuclear expert Bharat Karnad of the Centre for Policy Research emphasised that even if countries like Russia and France were persuaded to supply fuel in place of the US, they would look at guidelines put out by the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

 The group will in turn take into account the provisions of the Hyde act, and naturally, would not resume cooperation with India, he said.

 Asked how atomic energy boss Anil Kakodkar had agreed to such a deal, Karnad said: The nuclear establishment is unhappy with the agreement.

 However, pro-nuclear deal commentators like C. Raja Mohan of Nanyang University, Singapore, asked if the US had to go by the Hyde act, why it would take the trouble to go through another six months of negotiations with India and formulate the 123 Agreement.

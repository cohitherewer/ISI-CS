 Akalis ace on BJP steam

 GAJINDER SINGH

Chandigarh, Feb. 27: When Shiromani Akali Dal leaders look back at their comeback, they have to thank the BJP.

 Punjabs main Opposition party rode piggyback on its alliance partner to stun the ruling Congress in a vote that saw the BJP race to victory in most of the 23 seats it had contested way ahead of the three it won last time.

 Since the 2004 Lok Sabha polls, we had constituted teams in every locality and around every booth of seats we knew we would contest, said BJP state chief and Hoshiarpur MP Avinash Rai Khanna. The strategy has paid off. Had we managed more seats, we would have decimated the Congress.

 By evening, the alliance had won a clear majority in the 117-member Assembly, securing 67 of the 116 seats that went to poll. The Akali Dal had won 48 seats and the BJP 19.

 One of the reasons for the BJPs success was the growing feeling of alienation among Hindus from the Amarinder Singh-led Congress.

 The majority of the Hindus, who comprise over 40 per cent of the population in Punjab and are spread mostly in urban areas, have traditionally voted for the Congress. But many dumped the party this time because they felt the Congress was acting like a party of the Sikhs only. Amarinder, too, was acting like a leader of the Sikhs only and not that of Punjab, said BJP leader Vineet Joshi.

 While the Congress did well in rural areas that have traditionally been Akali Dal strongholds, defeat in seats that have been returning party candidates is being seen as a setback.

 We focused too much on seats the Akalis held and neglected the ones that have been ours. While in the rural areas we did well due to our development policies, it was in urban areas that we lost support for the first time, said state Congress chief Shamsher Singh Dullo, who lost from Khanna.

 It is not a clean victory for the Akali-BJP alliance. We have defeated the Akalis in their Malwa stronghold, a dejected Amarinder, who retained his seat from Patiala, told reporters.

 Akali Dal chief Parkash Singh Badal called the outcome a victory for democracy. We will not pursue politics of vendetta as Amarinder who believed in only jailing political opponents, he said.

 Badal, against whom several cases of alleged graft were lodged during Amarinders tenure, added that his government will not be vindictive.

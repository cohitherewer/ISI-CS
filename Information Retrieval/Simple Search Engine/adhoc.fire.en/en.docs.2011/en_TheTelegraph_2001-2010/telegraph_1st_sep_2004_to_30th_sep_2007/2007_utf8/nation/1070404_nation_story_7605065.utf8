 London, April 3: The centre of Bollywood moved to London today, with Shah Rukh Khan unveiling his waxwork model at Madame Tussauds and Aishwarya Rai promoting the general release of her film, Provoked.

 Im greatly thrilled and strangely sad at the same time, said Shah Rukh, who wore his black outfit from Don for todays unveiling.

 The waxwork model wore black, too. Its awesome when you come face to face with something thats so much like you, commented Shah Rukh, who arrived at Madame Tussauds in an open-topped Bentley to be greeted by the regulation screaming fans (a young woman from Pakistan was determined to get his autograph).

 Today, Shah Rukh had the floor of the house or rather the room known as Blush, which also accommodates the models of Amitabh Bachchan and Aishwarya. But the latter were removed temporarily so that the focus of attention was solely on King Khan for the unveiling.

 The statue was the work of a sculptor, Stephen Mansfield, who had to rely on 200 measurements, some of them intimate, plus an equal number of photographs sent to him by email from Mumbai where the actor provided an hour-long sitting (the vital statistics are never divulged, incidentally, a strict museum policy).

 The attention to detail is close the model, for example, wears Tag Heuers new limited edition Shah Rukh Khan Monaco Sixty Nine chronograph carrying his signature on the digital side of the dial.

 Yesterday, Mansfield met Shah Rukh in London for the first time and made last-minute adjustments to hair and styling. The model, which will be interactive, will allow visitors to pose alongside the waxwork with a choice of two backgrounds one from Don and the other from Devdas.

 The statue is more expressive than I am, commented Shah Rukh politely. He was accompanied by his wife, Gauri, who had told him: Hes better looking than you Im going to marry him.

 The team which put Shilpa Shetty into Celebrity Big Brother Bobby Khan, an agent in Mumbai, and Jazz Barton, his colleague in London acted as go-between as Madame Tussauds went through the elaborate process of turning Shah Rukhs measurements into a waxwork model.

 Madame Tussauds has attracted a new customer base by adding Bachchan and Aishwarya to its many attractions. These are now greatly enhanced by the inclusion of Shah Rukh and no doubt the list of Bollywood stars will grow. However, within a couple of years, Indians will not have to travel to London to visit Madame Tussauds, for Madame Tussauds is coming to India.

 The museum already has branches in New York, Las Vegas, Amsterdam, Hong Kong and Shanghai. A site has been identified in Mumbai, said Bobby, adding: Madame Tussauds in India will have many more Bollywood stars, plus many of the western stars who are in London. Shah Rukhs companions in Blush include David and Victoria Beckham.

 Shah Rukh said his late mother had told him to visit two places the Lido to see the dance and Madame Tussauds. It has been a lifelong dream since I visited the attraction as a child to be immortalised in wax and meet my very own Madame Tussauds likeness. I was thrilled to be involved in the whole creative process and see the artistry of the studio sculptors as they recreated me.

 Ben Lovett, public relations manager for the museum, said: Shah Rukh Khan is without doubt one of the most popular actors in the world today and we have had an unprecedented number of requests from international visitors to include him in our attraction. We are over the moon hes here.

 Shah Rukh returned the compliment: I am a movie star at this stage of my career because of the people in the UK. They are very responsible for making Indian films happen. I have done a lot of firsts in London.

 He said: My mom thought I would be in Madame Tussauds one day she thought I was very good looking. I wish she was alive for her it would have been very important.

 He said he was feeling philosophical. In a Bollywood film, if its the end, everyone is happy. Today, its very happy, so is this the end?

 Later today, in another part of London, Aishwarya was due to sit alongside Kiranjit Ahluwalia, the battered British housewife she portrays in Provoked, to discuss the film.

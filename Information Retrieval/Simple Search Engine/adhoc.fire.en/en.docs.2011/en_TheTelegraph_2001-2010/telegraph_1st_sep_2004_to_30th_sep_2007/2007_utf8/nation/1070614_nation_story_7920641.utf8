 55 towns appear on CAS radar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 13: The conditional access system (CAS) could become a must in 55 more towns, including Asansol, by 2011 if the suggestions of a Trai panel are accepted.

 Cable TV viewers in state capitals and cities with a population of over one million will have to switch to CAS, but the panel has proposed a phased introduction, starting 2008.

 It is felt that dates will have to be set for the start of the new system because a voluntary CAS one that allows operators to pick their time could be a non-starter.

 A Trai official heads the 16-member panel, whose members are drawn from the broadcasting and cable companies, besides the information and broadcasting ministry. 

 The suggestion on expanding CAS was made in the first part of its report, which was submitted on Tuesday. The recommendations will be discussed further before the regulator comes up with an official view. At present, the system is mandatory in all of Chennai and some areas of Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai. 

 The panels main task was to find out whether the CAS expansion can be made voluntary. But its report has made it clear that more cities cant be brought under the system unless dates are fixed for its introduction.

 A voluntary approach will succeed only if multi-system operators in a city the bigger firms that feed cable operators roll out CAS at the same time. This is difficult to achieve purely on a voluntary basis in a deregulated environment, the panel has said.

 The committee wants firms that expand the system beyond the 55 towns to be encouraged.

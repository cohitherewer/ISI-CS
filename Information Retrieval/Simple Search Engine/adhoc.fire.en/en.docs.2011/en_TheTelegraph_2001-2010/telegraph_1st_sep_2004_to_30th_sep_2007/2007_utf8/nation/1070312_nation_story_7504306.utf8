 Soldier of future takes JJ to Israel

 SUJAN DUTTA

 General Singh

 New Delhi, March 11: Army chief General Joginder Jaswant Singh is in Israel for demonstrations on Indias future-soldier programme that he is championing in the defence establishment.

 Singh is the first army chief to visit Israel, despite political opposition to India- Israel ties, since General V.P. Malik in 1998.

 General JJ, however, is so taken up with the project called F-INSAS Future Indian Infantry Soldier as a System that he decided to personally attend demonstrations in Israel and Italy. Israels Elbit Systems and an Italian firm are among US, British, French and German companies in the race to win contracts for the F-INSAS project that is still in its early stages.

 Singh unveiled the F-INSAS project in a study titled Infantry Vision 2020 at an army commanders conference in Delhi last April. In October, he led a team from the Infantry Directorate at a public presentation of Indias F-INSAS requirements and began scouting for equipment.

 He has set the deadline for the prototype of the supersoldier of the Indian army in 2012 years after the army chief will have retired. But Indias digital soldier will be General JJs legacy and mature by 2020.

 The F-INSAS project is of a pattern that is being experimented with by western militaries and even the Russian Spetznatz special forces that are currently operating in Chechnya. The US has demonstrated future-soldier equipment in Iraq and Afghanistan. But Israel gave the latest demonstration in its war against the Hizbollah in Lebanon in July-August last year.

 The Israeli defence forces performance in that war is currently being debated. An inquiry is being carried out by the Israeli government.

 While future-soldier equipment increases the infantrymans situational awareness, the concept has been criticised for the bulky and unwieldy gear that can weigh the soldier down. In the immediate scenario of the subcontinent this would be relevant. In one scenario, Indian soldiers will have to operate in difficult terrain such as in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

 In a presentation after last Aprils commanders conference, General JJ unveiled the image of F-INSAS. The future Indian infantryman will be equipped, according to that diagram, with helmet-mounted visors that will also function as Head Up Displays with monitors; the uniform will be lightweight, bullet-proof and able to prevent the soldier being contaminated by nuclear, chemical or biological matter.

 In November, one potential supplier demonstrated a smart vest equipped with sensors that monitor the soldiers blood pressure, heart rate and salt balance and automatically release medicines over a wound.

 General JJ had said the army has identified five areas lethality, awareness, survivability, communications and mobility that will be enhanced in the F-INSAS project. All of this will be made possible by wearable computers embedded into the uniform and the gear the soldier will carry.

 Allies tapped on President

 New Delhi, June 6: The Congress today began sounding alliance partners on its twin options for President candidate: Shivraj Patil and Pranab Mukherjee.

 The exercise got under way two days after the Congress Working Committee authorised Sonia Gandhi to finalise the UPA presidential nominee. RJD boss Lalu Prasad was among the first to be contacted by her political aides.

 Sources said Patil was ahead in the race at the moment because neither Sonia nor the Prime Minister was willing to release foreign minister Mukherjee.

 Mukherjee is the governments prime troubleshooter and the UPA big two feel his diplomatic skills would come in handy closer to the 2009 general elections, specially in dealing with the Left parties.

 The sources said Mukherjees name was still being offered as an option as the Congress does not want to annoy the CPM and its allies, which were the first to pitch for him.

 Other President candidate hopefuls such as Motilal Vora, Sushil Kumar Shinde and Karan Singh were virtually out of the reckoning, they said.

 Those considered as his replacement didnt quite make the cut, the sources added. Among them were Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Kamal Nath and S. Jaipal Reddy.

 Mukherjees indispensability in the government, party and Parliament was expected to be the Congresss line of argument on why he could not be spared for Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 The sources said Patil scored well on loyalty to 10 Janpath and experience he was the Speaker for five years although the UPA was not too happy with his record in the home ministry.

 They conceded it was up to Sonia and Singh to convince the Left about Patil.

 Shekhawat damper

 The BJP said Vice-President B.S. Shekhawat would not be the NDA candidate for Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 On a day third front leaders, including Jayalalithaa, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Chandrababu Naidu, met in Hyderabad to open their cards, Sushma Swaraj announced the BJPs strategy on the presidential poll that will be notified next week.

 Asked in a TV interview why the NDA was hesitant to announce Shekhawats candidacy, Sushma said: Because Bhairon Singhji will not be fielded by the NDA. If at all he contests, he will be fielded as an Independent and the NDA will only pledge its support.

 Explaining the reasons, Sushma said: NDA has already authorised Vajpayeeji to explore with other parties. Its a numbers game. You know there is quite a gap between NDA and UPA numbers. Therefore, we want to explore with other parties from whom we are getting support. And Atalji has not reported back to NDA yet.

 BJP spokesman Prakash Javdekar refused to confirm if Sushmas views represented those of the party.

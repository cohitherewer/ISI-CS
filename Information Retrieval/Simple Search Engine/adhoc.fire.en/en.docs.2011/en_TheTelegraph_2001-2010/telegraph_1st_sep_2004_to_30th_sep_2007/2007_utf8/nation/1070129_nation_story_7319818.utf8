 No space to park? Then dont buy car

 Purchase primer

 New Delhi, Jan. 28: Shifting to Delhi? If you are planning to buy a car there, better find the space to park it first.

 As a way of tackling the rise in number of vehicles, the draft Delhi Master Plan 2021 proposes that cars be registered only if their owners can prove they have parking space.

 The plan also suggests that underground car parks be built below parks and open spaces.

 Residents of the more upscale colonies have welcomed the idea, but those in other parts of the city say it is not practical.

 The Delhi government says such a plan alone can check the skyrocketing number of private vehicles in the city and that it would look into the proposals feasibility.

 The state transport department, acting on behalf of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, is already charging a one-time parking fee from owners of private vehicles for a period of 15 years. Owners of commercial vehicles must pay the fee annually when their licence is renewed.

 According to the draft Master Plan, the number of cars in Delhi has shot up from 5.13 lakh in 1981 to 32.38 lakh in 2001, while the number of buses private and government-run has leapt from 8,600 to 41,483.

 The draft Master Plan says that because of congestion and shortage of parking space in residential areas, cars are parked on the roads, reducing carriageway space.

 We welcome the new development plans in the draft Master Plan that emphasise the need for better parking facilities. The details will be finalised only after the plan gets the green light, transport minister Haroon Yusuf said.

 The general secretary of the Joint Front for Residents Welfare Associations, Pankaj Aggarwal, said, At least some thinking has started in the right direction.

 He suggested that the authorities take the cue from countries that have solved similar problems.

 But S. Hassan, general secretary of the Federation of Residents Welfare Associations, Northeast district, opposed the proposal. He argued it flew in the face of the relief given by the government when it increased the ground coverage area.

 With an increased floor-area ratio on the ground floor, there is no room for parking. The policy is not viable in resettlement and unauthorised colonies where building has been done in a haphazard manner, Hassan said.

 The floor-area ratio is the area of a buildings floor divided by the size of the plot on which it is built.

 Apolitical PM warms to politics

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

New Delhi, Jan. 4: Manmohan Singh, the academic-bureaucrat, appears to be shedding his distaste for politics or he may have just learned to mask it.

 This week, the Prime Minister broke bread with the BJP brass after recent run-ins with L.K. Advani, the partys leader in the Lok Sabha.

 Singh invited Advani, his Rajya Sabha counterpart Jaswant Singh and Atal Bihari Vajpayee home for lunch and talks addressing their complaint that the government does not consult the Opposition and securing for himself a cushion as he works on the Kashmir issue.

 The Prime Minister, who regards the Kashmir initiative as a high point of his tenure, does not want the BJP to accuse his government of a sellout or otherwise say or do something that might hurt his efforts at finding a solution. He put the subject on top of the agenda for talks with the BJP brass. Now even if the BJP protests, it cant claim it was in the dark.

 The partys loud protests against the Sachar committees report havent cut much ice with Singh, who remains firm about implementing the recommendations. That is why he ignores the BJPs incessant campaign of minority appeasement and stresses from every possible forum the need for an inclusive growth, a source said.

 But the Prime Ministers near-perfect balancing act was on the Singur land row. He made it clear he was on the side of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in the ideological battle and then, when things appeared to be getting a little out of hand, wrote to Mamata Banerjee to call off her fast, which she promptly did.

 The result: Bhattacharjee, his most trusted ally in the Left, was happy and so was the Bengal Congress, which didnt want him to be seen as too anti-Mamata. Also, Singhs stand on reforms was not compromised.

 Tightrope-walking on another occasion did not provide quite such a happy result. The Prime Minister found himself in a piquant situation when MDMK leader Vaiko first wrote a letter to him, alleging that the DMK was out to split his party, and then followed it up with a meeting. 

 What can the Prime Minister do? If a political leader asks to meet him, he cannot say no, said a Tamil Nadu Congress functionary. Despite the MDMK severing its ties with the DMK before the Tamil Nadu Assembly elections and making common cause with the ADMK, it remains a part of the ruling coalition at the Centre. 

 Although Singh merely heard out Vaiko in silence, the meeting angered the DMK. T.R. Baalu, the Union minister from the party, called on him the same day and brought to his notice an interview by Vaiko in which he had claimed that the Prime Minister and Congress president Sonia Gandhi had condemned the DMKs alleged machinations. The DMK is a loyal ally and we can do nothing to annoy its leaders, a Congress source said. Within hours, the Congress issued a media release denying Vaikos claims.

 Vaiko had also written to Sonia but she did not meet him. Another time Singhs political foray caused anxiety in the Congress was when he used ally Ram Vilas Paswans Dalit-Muslim conference to make his pro-minority assertions.

 Some in the Congress complained he should not give a non-Congress Dalit leader legitimacy at a time the party is trying to recover its Dalit votes in the Hindi heartland.

 It is time though that they stop complaining about an apolitical Prime Minister.

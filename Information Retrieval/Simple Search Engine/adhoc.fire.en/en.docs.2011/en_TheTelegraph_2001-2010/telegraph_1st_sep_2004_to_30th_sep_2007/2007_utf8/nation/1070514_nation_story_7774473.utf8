 By her parents, but far away

 Lucknow, May 13: The mother and daughter were both in pink, but were a study in contrasts.

 Mayavatis parents Ramlata and Prabhudayal sat in awestruck silence through the swearing-in at the Raj Bhavan today as 49 Bahujan Samaj Party ministers bowed and touched their daughters feet.

 Two ministers were so overwhelmed at Mayavatis presence that they were trembling and could barely read their oath. Each time she gave them an encouraging look, they trembled even more.

 But not once during the hour-long ceremony did Mayavati turn and look at her parents. When they finally came face to face with her after proceedings were over, she mechanically introduced them to governor T.V. Rajeswar. 

 Ramlata and Prabhudayal hesitantly bowed before him, but Mayavati looked distant, making no eye contact with them.

 She did not pay respects to her parents for the sake of TV cameras either. BSP leaders said such a gesture would have been too Manuvadi for her comfort. But when TV cameramen and photographers clamoured for a group picture, she hurriedly hustled her parents into the frame.

 Her face, however, was devoid of emotion. She stood by her parents but her eyes looked somewhere far away.

 In 2005, Mayavati had officially announced at the BSP headquarters that she would be snapping relations with her parents so that she could dedicate herself to the cause of Dalit empowerment. Her parents had accepted her decision as some kind of a divine command.

 Since that day, Mayavati had ceased to be their daughter. Like the rest of the Bahujan Samaj, they too started calling her behenji. They were heard thanking her for putting them up in a five-star hotel when they arrived from Delhi yesterday.

 Ramlata said a sadhu had predicted her daughters destiny when she was 15 days old. A sadhu had predicted that she would become a national leader one day. Today, she is the queen of Uttar Pradesh. One day shell be Prime Minister.

 Prabhudayal, 82, who retired as a supervisor from the telecom department, said he was proud of her. We knew your behenji would win. She has been a confident girl from her childhood.

 At the BSP headquarters, one of party founder Kanshi Rams wishes engraved in lapis lazuli makes a telling statement. It says that after Mayavatis death her bones should not be immersed in the Ganga but be laid beside my (Kanshi Rams) bones in the memorial.

 The rationale Kanshi Ram gives for such a wish is that it will go against the Manuvadi system of society and inspire the people of Bahujan Samaj to show respect towards this memorial.

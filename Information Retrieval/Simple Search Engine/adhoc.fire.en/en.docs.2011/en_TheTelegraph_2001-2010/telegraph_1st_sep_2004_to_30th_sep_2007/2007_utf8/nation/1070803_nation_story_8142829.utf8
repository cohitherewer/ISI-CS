 Amitabh, Aishwarya, Abhishek: In trouble 

 Mumbai, Aug. 2: Sachin Tendulkar and Amitabh, Aishwarya and Abhishek Bachchan are among celebrities and firms that owe the government Rs 13.32 crore in stamp duty, it was revealed today.

 Notices and reminders have been issued to the defaulters and if they fail to respond, action will be taken under the Mumbai Stamp Act 1958, revenue minister Narayan Rane told the Assembly in a written reply to a question.

 The Bachchan father, son and daughter-in-law are among the defaulters who have not responded to notices, the statement said. Others similarly guilty are John Abraham, Saif Ali Khan, Juhi Chawla, Preity Zinta, Ajay Devgan, Kajol, Lara Datta, Mandira Bedi, Sanjay Dutt, Dia Mirza, Karisma Kapoor, Zaheer Khan and Malaika Arora Khan. 

 But Saifs secretary denied this. I went to the registrars office myself around March or April and paid stamp duty on agreements. He has not received any notice for sure, Fareed Khan said. 

 Stamp duty is charged on any monetary contract such as brand endorsements or film agreements above Rs 1 lakh.

 Sachin and actors Suniel Shetty, Aamir Khan, Fardeen Khan and his father Feroze Khan have not paid Rs 3.18 lakh in stamp duty, Rane said. Others who are yet to pay up are Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, Bipasha Basu and director Priyadarshan. 

 Bipashas chartered accountant Manoj Dagga agreed she had not paid. 

 I dont know if she has received any notice, but we have not paid stamp duty as yet, he said. 

 Bharti Airtel has challenged the notice seeking Rs 12.12 crore stamp duty in the high court and the matter is sub judice, Rane said. 

 The recovery of the remaining Rs 1.20 crore is awaited, he added. 

 BPL mobile, which has Rs 23.87 lakh outstanding, and MTNL that has not paid Rs 60.48 lakh are on the list of defaulting firms which also includes names such as Yash Raj Films, UTV, STAR India, Castrol, Satchi amp; Satchi, Leo Burnett India, Ogilvy and Mather and malls like Crossroads.

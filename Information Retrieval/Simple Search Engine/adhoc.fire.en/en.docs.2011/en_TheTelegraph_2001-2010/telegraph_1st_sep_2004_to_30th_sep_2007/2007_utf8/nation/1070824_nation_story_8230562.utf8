 Out-of-body experience 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: Scientists in Europe have for the first time induced out-of-body experiences in healthy people through experiments to explore the brain mechanisms of a sensation long believed to be pure imagination.

 Research groups in Sweden and Switzerland have used video cameras and virtual reality a technology that has been used in the past to produce illusions to create the impression in volunteers that they were outside their own bodies. 

 In the past, patients with epilepsy, stroke or drug abuse have reported out-of-body experiences the feeling of disembodiment in which the self appears separated from the body. But how the brain produces this experience remained unclear. 

 Now, scientists have used cameras and head-mounted virtual reality goggles to show participants their own backs from the perspective of someone sitting behind them. The results of the experiments will appear in the US journal Science on Friday. 

 Virtual reality has been around for 20 years, but this is the first time it has been used to create the illusion of looking at yourself and feeling that youre outside your physical body, said Henry Ehrsson, a neuroscientist at Karolinska Institute, who conducted these experiments while at the University College, London. 

 Such studies will help advance brain science. They will help us understand better how the brain maintains the usual perceptions of in-body experience, Ehrsson told The Telegraph. 

 Ehrsson said the studies may also lead to new advances in video games. 

 This is essentially a means of projecting yourself a form of teleportation. If we can project people into a virtual character, so they feel and respond as if they were really in a virtual version of themselves, imagine the implications.

 In his experiments, Ehrsson measured a persons physiological response the level of perspiration on skin to a scenario in which they felt the illusory body was under threat of an attack. The body response indicated that they viewed the threat as real.

 In the second set of studies, neurologist Olaf Blanke and colleagues at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale at Lausanne used virtual reality experiments to project to volunteers images of their own bodies or objects in front of them. 

 Several volunteers in the Swiss experiments localised their selves to a position outside their bodies, indicating that signals from the eyes appear to dominate the processes that lead the brain to determine the position of the self.

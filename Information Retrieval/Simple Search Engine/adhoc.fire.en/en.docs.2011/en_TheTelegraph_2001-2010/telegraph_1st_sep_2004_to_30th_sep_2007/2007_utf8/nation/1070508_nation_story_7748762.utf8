 AIIMS pot boils again

 New Delhi, May 7: All India Institute of Medical Sciences director P. Venugopal sat silently for most of the institutes governing body meeting at Nirman Bhavan today. On the one occasion he tried to speak, he stammered and then fell silent again.

 Another round has commenced in the battle for control of AIIMS, fuelled by a probe report that confirmed caste discrimination in Indias top medical college. 

 The AIIMS governing body, chaired by health minister Anbumani Ramadoss, sternly reminded Venugopal, on more than one occasion, that he was answerable to the council. 

 Not far away, the Supreme Court issued a notice to Venugopal after the Centres counsel alleged that AIIMS was meting out second- and third-class treatment to SC/ST students.

 Venugopal has been asked by the governing body to re-examine Ajay Kumar Singh, a final-year MBBS student belonging to a scheduled caste, who was made to appear for a test under conditions different from that for other students. 

 During Ajays practical viva examination, a cameraman was stationed to record the proceedings to prove later that there was no discrimination without informing him.

 Internationally, it is accepted that examinations are only fair if all students are examined under the same conditions. What happened to Ajay is shocking and the AIIMS director was told to own up responsibility for it, a source said. 

 Venugopal was also told to reinstate registrar V.K. Gupta, who was dismissed in violation of an earlier governing body decision. The governing body plans to meet again in two to three weeks, when Venugopal is likely to face the heat again, the source said. 

 The stand-off came a day after it was revealed that the Thorat committee had come across several instances of caste-based discrimination at AIIMS.

 The committee linked the discrimination to the proactive role the AIIMS administration played fanning anti-quota sentiments. The anti-quota agitation had brought out in the open the simmering differences between the minister and the director.

 The two appeared to be on a collision course again with the governing board showcausing faculty members who criticised the committee report.

 Representatives of the faculty association, who met Venugopal tonight, are expected to decide on their course of action tomorrow. The resident doctors association has also condemned the bad behaviour towards the director by the governing body.

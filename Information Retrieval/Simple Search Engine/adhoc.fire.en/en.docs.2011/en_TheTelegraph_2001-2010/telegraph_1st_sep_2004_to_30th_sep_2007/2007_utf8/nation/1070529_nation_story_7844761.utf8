 Army signals displeasure

 SUJAN DUTTA

 General J.J. Singh

 New Delhi, May 28: The military has disbanded the Armed Forces Tribunal Cell on an order from General Joginder Jaswant Singh to express dissatisfaction with the defence ministrys unwillingness to set up an organisation that will deal with disputes on promotions in the services, a senior official has said.

 The cell, formed on January 16 last year, was disbanded (reported by The Telegraph on May 22) despite it being the chief interface between the ministry and the services to set up the tribunal.

 Lt General Mohinder Singh was in charge of the cell as adjutant general till he retired late last year. He was appointed the consultant and coordinator after he retired.

 General J.J. Singh took the decision to disband the cell immediately after taking over as the chairman, chiefs of staff committee. The order was executed on May 1. The disbanding followed a rejection by the defence ministry of recommendations to promote two generals.

 The ministry had also asked the armed forces on the recommendations to promote four other major generals to the lieutenant-general rank after first overlooking their cases. 

 The Armed Forces Tribunal is expected to settle such disputes within the services outside civilian courts. But no step towards setting up the tribunal has been recorded in the 17 months since the Armed Forces Tribunal Bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha in December 2005. When the bill was introduced in Parliament, about 7,500 dispute cases were pending in courts. The figure has now crossed 8,000.

 The latest of the disputes to head to court is that of Major General Lumba, who has filed a writ in Delhi High Court for being denied promotion as general officer commanding in chief of 21 (Strike) Corps. The office has now been taken by Lt General Pradeep Khanna.

 The defence ministry had rejected the armys recommendation to promote Lumba because he was awarded a recordable censure after a swimming pool was built instead of a water tank in his Hissar division (home of the armoured regiment Skinners Horse).

 The four major generals were not found suitable for promotion to the rank of lieutenant general by the army board the first time. But the board reversed its decision and recommended their cases at the next opportunity.

 The Special Selection Board for officers of the ranks of major generals and above comprises the army chief (presiding officer), the vice-chief and all seven army commanders. The military secretary (also a lieutenant general like the vice-chief and the commanders) is its secretary. The army board usually meets twice a year in April and September.

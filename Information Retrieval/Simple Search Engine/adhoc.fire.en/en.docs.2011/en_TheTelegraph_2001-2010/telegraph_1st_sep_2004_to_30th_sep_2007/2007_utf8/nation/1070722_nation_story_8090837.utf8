 The teenager, a resident of Panchsheel Park in west Delhis Vikas Nagar area, wanted to play a prank, but his attempt backfired. Mehto had used his brothers mobile phone and somebody elses SIM card to make the call, hoping that he would not be caught.

 He has now been remanded in a days police custody by magistrate Sanjeev Kumar Pandey of the Tis Hazari courts .

 Seeking the remand, public prosecutor Praveen Kumar Bansal said that there could be involvement of other persons in this entire episode and to unearth it, we need to interrogate him.

 A home ministry official said the security establishment had not been rattled by the news. We only took precautions, otherwise the claim was not logical.

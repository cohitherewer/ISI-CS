 Glare on narco tests

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 16: Calcutta High Court today stayed an order allowing police to conduct narco-analysis tests on Mihir Kumar Jha and Ranvijay Pathak in connection with a JEE test scam.

 The judge stayed the decision of the investigators to conduct the narco-analysis and brain mapping for a fortnight, the duos counsel, Jaymalya Bagchi, said. The court will hear the matter in detail before deciding whether probe agencies should have the right to conduct such tests if the accused dont agree, he added.

 This is the first time the high court has decided to look into the matter. Narco-analysis and brain mapping are not admissible as evidence.

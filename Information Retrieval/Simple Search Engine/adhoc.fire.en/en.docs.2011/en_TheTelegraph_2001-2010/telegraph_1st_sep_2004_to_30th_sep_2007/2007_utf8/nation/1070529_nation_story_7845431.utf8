 Cyber Naidu turns farmer

 Tirupati, May 28: N. Chandrababu Naidu, the former pro-reform chief minister tainted by farmer suicides, has done an about-turn and endorsed the economic policies of the CPM.

 The out-of-power Telugu Desam Party chief, who is now cosying up to the Marxists to try and form a third front, today demanded more subsidies for Andhra Pradesh farmers and land for landless peasants.

 The reforms have created a new generation of billionaires but the poor have become poorer. The agriculture sector is in a crisis and the rural economy in tatters, he told reporters on the second day of his partys silver jubilee celebrations at Tirupati.

 He said only the CPMs alternative economic model could ensure that the benefits of reforms reach the poor and help revive the rural economy.

 As part of his image makeover bid, Naidu has begun adopting Left and farm symbols, too. At yesterdays inauguration of the three-day celebrations, he had let himself be photographed in a farmers turban, holding a miniature plough.

 The CPM has already tied up with the Desam in the state, but told him he must spell out his economic policies if he wants support at the national level.

 The Desam meeting, attended by 12,000 delegates, today adopted a resolution on an alternative economic policy.

 Asked if the partys ideology was turning pro-communist, Naidu shot back: We are pro-realistic. We want modification of policies in tune with the changing times.

 The Desam needs the support of both the CPM and farmers for a political revival.

 Naidus policies as chief minister, seen as World Bank dictated, had made Hyderabad an infotech hub while debt-ridden farmers killed themselves by the hundreds in the villages. 

 The man dubbed the CEO of Andhra Pradesh reaped the consequences in the 2004 elections when his party suffered a rout.

 Naidus alliance with the BJP had turned away the Muslims, too. Now, having dumped the National Democratic Alliance and being pitted against the Congress in his state, he needs to regain his secular credentials as much as he needs the cushion of a third front.

 Today, he demanded a higher quota for the minorities in the state even though the current 5 per cent reservation is caught in a legal tangle.

 He later told The Telegraph that a third front was needed to fill the gap created by the decline in the vote shares of the United Progressive Alliance and the NDA.

 Their setback in Uttar Pradesh has strengthened the resolve of like-minded parties to have a new and independent platform, he said. The third front is the dream not only of the Telugu Desam but also of several other non-Congress and non-BJP Opposition parties.

 In his autumn, Basu to the rescue of party and front

 Calcutta, March 17: Unlike old soldiers, old communists do not even fade away. Jyoti Basu may be approaching 93, but he had to come to the rescue of a beleaguered CPM and its partners in the Left Front. 

 Mamata Banerjees praise, after years of jabs and jibes, may have pleased the patriarch. What he did for the party and the front was far more substantial. It was largely Basus intervention that assuaged the feelings of the CPMs allies which had seen red at Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees handling of the Nandigram developments. 

 Basu did what the allies had wanted to do to Bhattacharjee. He slammed the chief minister, once his protg, on the police firing at Nandigram. In doing so, he absolved the allies of any responsibility for the failure of the government of which they are a part. 

 He also took things beyond Nandigram. The tragedy was a result, the allies complained, of the chief ministers tendency to ignore them on important economic, political and administrative decisions. 

 Basu voiced their complaint and got Bhattacharjee to promise that the functioning of the government and the front would, henceforth, be truly collective. 

 What happens to this promise remains to be seen. Even Basu knows how things work in a coalition in which one party has too large a dominance because of its overwhelming majority in the Assembly. It would be unrealistic to expect the Congress to consult all partners of the UPA government at the Centre on all important policy decisions or executive matters. Nor did the BJP do so during the tenure of the NDA government. 

 Basu knows things were no different in his own time as chief minister. If he was not deciding matters, his party was the allies existed mostly as footnotes. And, the allies cried foul even then. During one of its worst rows with the CPM on the eve of the panchayat elections in 1983, the RSP called the former a party of social fascists. 

 But, Basus purpose was served. He sang to the allies tune and managed to extract a promise from them not to break away from either the front or the government. Not that the allies were going to act immediately on their threat of leaving the government. 

 However, what Basu did for his own party was perhaps even more important than what he did for the allies or the front. He reminded the CPM that, despite its brute majority in the Assembly and huge organisation, its stay in power depended on the front remaining united. 

 He remembers the lessons, perhaps better than younger leaders, from the failures of the first two United Front governments in 1967 and 1969. In other words, he warned Bhattacharjee that ignoring the allies does not serve his own and the partys interest. 

 For the CPM, too, there could be an interesting fallout of Basus intervention. It could prompt some leaders within the CPM to put the brakes on the chief minister. 

 Although Bhattacharjee managed to get the state party and also the central leadership by his side in his aggressive industrialisation drive, there still were sceptics other than the maverick Subhas Chakraborty. 

 And, the critics were not all from the Citu. They supported the partys line on industrialisation but did not like the chief ministers aggressive and unilateral ways of implementing it. Silenced so far, they could find their voice again. And, they could take their grievances to Basu more and more. 

 In his autumn, the CPM patriarch could find himself yet again in the thick of party and front politics. Whether he likes it or not, Bhattacharjee may no longer have the choice of marginalising his old mentor.

 Salim here to stay, ready to wait for land

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Prasun Mukherjee

 Calcutta, Jan. 10: A Salim Group partner today said the Indonesian company was willing to wait till the Bengal government acquired land for a special economic zone in East Midnapore.

 We are here to stay. We will wait till the government acquires the land and hands it over to us, Prasun Mukherjee, an NRI industrialist and Salims collaborator, told reporters after a meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings.

 An unauthorised attempt to list the areas to be acquired which the chief minister yesterday described as a blunder had ignited clashes in Nandigram, killing at least six people.

 Asked how long the group will wait for the land, Mukherjee said: Time does not matter. We will wait.

 He dismissed suggestions that Salim is looking elsewhere in the wake of the outbreak of violence. 

 I came to meet the chief minister to say that we will continue here in the state with all our projects of SEZs, roads, bridges and others, Mukherjee said.

 Among the projects are the special economic zone on 10,000 acres at Nandigram and a chemical hub in Haldia. 

 Mukherjee said a business delegation from China would reach Bengal on January 19 and 20 to tour Salims SEZ locations. The delegates will stay here for about a week and meet the chief minister. 

 Land plea to Centre

 Officials said the Bengal commerce and industries department is considering a few proposals to bring about flexibility in the rules governing the creation of SEZs. 

 The department will send a proposal to the Centre requesting it to consider reducing the minimum land requirement for setting up multi-product SEZs from 2,500 acres to 1,000 acres.

 Unavailability of land in states like Bengal where land is densely populated and cultivated has prompted the move. 

 Land revenue officers from all districts in Bengal have been asked to identify fallow areas within a week so that the government can prepare a map.

 The decision was taken at a meeting of district land revenue officers with land reforms commissioner P.K. Agrawal at Writers Buildings during the day.

 According to Agrawal, 237 recorded bargadars have been given compensation for land acquired for the Tata car project.

 However, cases involving 104 unrecorded bargadars are being investigated to ascertain if they are entitled to compensation. We are probing if 104 people whose land was taken over at Singur are entitled to the compensation, he added.

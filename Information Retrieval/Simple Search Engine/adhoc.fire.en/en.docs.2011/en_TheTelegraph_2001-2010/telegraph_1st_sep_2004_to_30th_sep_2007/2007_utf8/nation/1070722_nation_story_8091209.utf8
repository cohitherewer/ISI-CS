 ESPN piracy alert for cable operators

 New Delhi, July 21 (PTI): Armed with a Delhi High Court order against piracy of the ongoing India-England cricket series, sports broadcaster ESPN-STAR today warned cable operators of strict action in case of violation.

 The high court had yesterday restrained 104 cable operators across the country from the telecast or transmission of the cricket series, which began on July 19, without licence from the broadcaster.

 We are stepping up our monitoring mechanism to tackle this issue so that the court order is followed and strict action is taken against cable operators who telecast cricket matches illegally, ESPN-STAR software vice-president Rajesh Kaul said.

 He added that non-compliance of the order by any cable operator would tantamount to contempt of court.

 ESPN has got exclusive rights from the England and Wales Cricket Board to telecast the series in India and Nepal, which is being beamed on its new channel STAR Cricket.

 The broadcaster said the court had also passed an injunction order against unnamed cable operators found to be indulging in piracy of cricket matches involving India and England. Police authorities have been directed to render all assistance to ESPN to enforce the order, it added.

 The broadcaster had contended that many cable operators across the country indulged in rampant cable piracy.

 Salman speed rap

 Jodhpur, March 23 (PTI): Police intercepted actor Salman Khans car this morning for speeding and slapped a case against the driver.

 A case was registered under the Motor Vehicles Act against the driver, additional superintendent of police (traffic) Surendra Kumar Gupta said. His driving licence has been seized.

 Salman was on his way to court in connection with two appeals filed by him against his conviction for poaching black bucks in 1998.

 The police intercepted the car near Circuit House Road for violating the speed limit, Gupta said.

 Salmans black Scorpio was running at 61 kmph though the permissible speed limit in the area was 40 kmph, he added.

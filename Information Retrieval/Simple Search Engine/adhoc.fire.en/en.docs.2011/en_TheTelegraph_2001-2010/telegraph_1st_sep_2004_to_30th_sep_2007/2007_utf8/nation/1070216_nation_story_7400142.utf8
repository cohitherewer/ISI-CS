 Centre feels price pinch 

Poll alarm rings in Congress

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: Oil and water dont mix but a downpour has made the Congress sit up and take note of the price rise.

 When Punjab went to polls on Tuesday, the high turnout 70 per cent despite blinding rain compelled the Congress to brace for a vote of change. The result will be out on February 27 but the hunt for scapegoats has already begun. If the Congress loses power in Punjab, much of the blame will be laid at the door of chief minister Amarinder Singh.

 But the favourite whipping boy price rise is also prompting some to train guns on the Centre. 

 The Congress believes inflation may cost it power in Uttarakhand and the zilla parishad polls in Maharashtra that will be held by the month-end.

 Congress president Sonia Gandhi is believed to have conveyed to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that he, finance minister P. Chidambaram and petroleum minister Murli Deora should douse the anger before the budget session.

 Party sources said they would not let the government get away lightly if the price rise is not checked. They will either demand a special CWC meeting or raise the issue at the parliamentary party with a request that Chidambaram be present to answer questions.

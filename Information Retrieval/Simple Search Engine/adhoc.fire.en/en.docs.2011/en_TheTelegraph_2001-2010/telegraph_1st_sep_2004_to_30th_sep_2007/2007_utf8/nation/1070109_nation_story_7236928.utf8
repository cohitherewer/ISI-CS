 Army treads with caution

 New Delhi, Jan. 8: The army has put an additional brigade on standby for deployment in Upper Assam but is reluctant to rush in more troops as a knee-jerk response to the violence that has taken a toll of over 60 migrant workers over the last three days.

 The army told the government that the deployment under its Tezpur-headquartered 4 Corps was already at an optimum and involved about the same number of troops that was used at the peak of counter-insurgency operations named Bajrang and Rhino I in the eighties and nineties.

 Central paramilitary forces from Karbi Anglong where elections to the autonomous district council were held on Saturday are likely to be moved into the Upper Assam districts of Dibrugarh, Jorhat and Sivasagar.

 The security grid in Assam was reviewed at several meetings held in New Delhi and Guwahati.

 In New Delhi today, the defence secretary and the service chiefs met defence minister A.K. Antony, who will be visiting the Northeast for two days from tomorrow.

 His first engagement is with the 4 Corps whose general-officer-commanding Lt Gen. R.K. Chhabra is scheduled to brief him in Tezpur. The defence minister will be accompanied by chief of army staff Gen. J.J. Singh.

 The 4 Corps chief had also briefed minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal in Guwahati last evening. Jaiswal is understood to have inquired if more troops should be deployed in Upper Assam. Though this was not specified, it is understood that there were inquiries on whether the army can consider reducing its troops along the border with China in Arunachal Pradesh and re-deploy them in Upper Assam. Concluding that this was not immediately called for, the army has begun area-domination patrols.

 Army sources said recurrent attacks on soft targets in Assam, such as the Bihari migrant labourers, could not be stopped altogether if the Ulfa persisted with such methods.

 The armys understanding is that the Ulfa is trying to register its presence by picking up soft targets because it is fighting shy of security forces.

 The army has decided that it will alert a brigade in Shillong a peace station for deployment if the security forces in Upper Assam prove to be inadequate or if tension in other parts of Assam stretches the security grid.

 Sivasagar district will almost entirely be the responsibility of the central forces.

 Though the army is considering moving additional personnel from the 24 companies of central forces from Karbi Anglong, the situation in the district is fragile, too, with Karbi and Dimasa tribes engaged in frequent clashes.

 The 4 Corps has three divisions. The Rangia-based 21 (Rhino) division is responsible for Lower Assam, which is relatively peaceful now.

 The two divisions responsible for Upper Assam and Arunachal Pradesh 5 and 2 have a brigade each (headquartered in Laipuli near Tinsukia and Lohia in Arunachal Pradesh) for counter-insurgency operations.

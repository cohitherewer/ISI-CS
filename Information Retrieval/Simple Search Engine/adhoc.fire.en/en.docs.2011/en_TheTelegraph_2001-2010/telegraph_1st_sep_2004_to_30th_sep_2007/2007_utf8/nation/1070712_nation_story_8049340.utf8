 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Sparks fly over idol immersion

 Hyderabad has a towering problem. Ganesh puja organisers are planning life-size idols but police want them cut to size.

 The Khairatabad Ganesh Utsav Samiti is bragging about its 40-foot-high Ganesh. Already, more than 100 hands are busy with the record-setting idol.

 We cant build a smaller idol. We will lose our reputation, responded S. Sudarshan, a Samiti member to calls from the police to scale down their aspirations a little.

 The idol, weighing around 12 tonnes, will require over 800 bags of plaster of Paris to stand above the rest. The artisans will take about two-and-half months to complete it.

 Assistant commissioner N.V. Surendra Babu insists hes not setting a rule. We are only advising. Some foot-over-bridges and flyovers can stand in the way of big idols.

 Each year, overhead cables above busy streets are snapped when organisers cart their Ganesh idols for immersion. But this time, new road bridges might make it difficult for the big statues to be wheeled to the Hussainsagar Lake. There is also the danger of water pollution. 

 Army wives on new front

 This is one battle where they are doing as well as their husbands, if not better.

 Wives of army officers have set up a courier collection centre that will be manned only by differently-abled people. 

 At the canteen stores inside the army headquarters, the centre will be assisted by DTDC Courier and Cargo Limited. The son of an officer will be running the store, which aims to provide gainful employment to the differently-abled.

 Apart from employment, the people working at the centre will also be involved in recreational activities from to time to time as a part of their rehabilitation efforts. Civilians as well as army personnel wounded in battle can work at the centre. 

 Poetry wave for sea cops

 Used to chasing Tamil Tiger boats in the deep, the coast guard recently rode a wave of a different kind a kavi sammelan.

 Five Hindi poets tested their prowess with couplets at an event organised on board a coast guard vessel called Sarang.

 The contest was in Hindi, but most coast guard employees and officers know the language, even the ones from the south. Anil Bohre, from Uttar Pradesh, led the word warriors, giving the men in uniform and their families a much-needed relief from their tough life.

 As is common during such sammelans, most participants couldnt resist the temptation of Urdu, the language of grace and romance that lends itself easily to poetry. But Bhore gave it a comic touch when he pulled off lines on the heartlands most widely watched politician Lalu Prasad.

 Shaky tracks

 A part of Delhi Metro appears to be on shaky tracks.

 Residents have raised objections to plans to build the Central Secretariat-Badarpur route on elevated tracks. 

 We intimated urban development minister Jaipal Reddy about concerns over the elevated tracks in the Jangpura-Kalkaji stretch. He has promised to take the tracks underground, Rajeev Kakaria, convener of the residents association, said after a meeting on Tuesday. 

 The meeting was also attended by Metro managing director E. Shreedharan, chief minister Shiela Dikshit and other officials. The residents do not want the trains on elevated tracks because of fears over demolitions and safety.

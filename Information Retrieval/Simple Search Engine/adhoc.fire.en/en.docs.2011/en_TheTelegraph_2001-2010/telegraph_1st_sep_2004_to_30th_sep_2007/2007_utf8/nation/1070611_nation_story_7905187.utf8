 Death threat to Cong

 Ahmedabad, June 10: Narendra Modi today defended the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh and threatened the Opposition Congress with a similar fate.

 Let Congress members listen carefully. Those dancing in the funeral procession of Sohrabuddin will meet a similar fate in the coming Assembly elections, the chief minister said.

 Gujarat ki janta Congress ka encounter kar degi (the people of Gujarat will eliminate the Congress in an encounter), he said, warming to the theme, perhaps inspired by the presence of party MP Navjyot Sidhu at his side.

 Modi, in his first comments on Sohrabuddins killing, denied the gangster was shot in a fake encounter a stand contradictory to what his government has told the Supreme Court. There is no place for terrorists in Gujarat, Modi told his audience at Gaurav Sammelan, a function organised by loyalists to fete him for becoming Gujarats longest-serving chief minister.

 Modi completed 2,063 days in the chair on June 1, surpassing the states third chief minister Hitendra Desais record of 2,062 uninterrupted days in the early 1970s. But he lags Bengals Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee by almost a year.

 Modis bravado couldnt hide a stark fact: despite an array of BJP leaders on the dais, many from his own state had failed to turn up to congratulate their chief minister. The anti-Modi camp, mostly from the powerful Patel community, will hold a show of strength in Surat tomorrow to honour their leader, former chief minister Keshubhai Patel.

 Former Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, BJP president Rajnath Singh and former party president Venkaiah Naidu, however, showered praises on the countrys best chief minister.

 State BJP chief Purushottam Rupala attacked the dissidents saying the party was watching them, but he would know as well as Modi how crucial the Patel community is to the partys poll prospects. 

 Advani said Modis longevity was not why he admired him: I admire him for making Gujarat a model state.

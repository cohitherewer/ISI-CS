The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 A political sideshow

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, July 31: Priya Ranjan Das Munshi was the only senior Congressman to react to Sanjay Dutts jail sentence, saying the actor had suffered enough.

 As a minister, I do not want to question the judiciary, but in a civil society the time has come to gauge the parameters for an unintentional fault, for which Sanjay Dutt had already suffered long enough in the first instance, he said.

 The proposal would find several takers in the political establishment, Das Munshi was confident. There are persons across the political divide who feel the same about Sanjay.

 Das Munshi, who said he was speaking both as a Congress leader and minister, expressed deep shock and surprise at the verdict in a news release. 

 He pointed out the tremendous impact Lage Raho Munnabhai had. It was as though Sanjay rediscovered Gandhiji and his moral principles for the young generation, the minister said, adding that he was issuing the statement on his own. 

 When the judge absolved Sanjay of Tada charges, it was established beyond doubt that he had nothing to do with terrorism, Das Munshi said.

 As information and broadcasting minister, he was also concerned about the film industrys huge stakes in Sanjays career. I cannot be indifferent to this aspect, he said. 

 Das Munshi recalled the deep association he had with Sanjays father, the late Sunil Dutt, and hoped his statement would set party colleagues thinking. 

 Not many in the Congress shared Das Munshis feelings or, if they did, were circumspect. What can the party do? The public prosecutor upheld the law, he did his duty. We can only empathise with the family, said a central minister from Maharashtra.

 His clinical statement, in a sense, reflected the complex equation that had existed between the quintessential Maharashtra Congressman and Sunil Dutt, seen as an outsider even though he never lost his Mumbai North seat when the BJP-Shiv Sena picked up the rest in election after election.

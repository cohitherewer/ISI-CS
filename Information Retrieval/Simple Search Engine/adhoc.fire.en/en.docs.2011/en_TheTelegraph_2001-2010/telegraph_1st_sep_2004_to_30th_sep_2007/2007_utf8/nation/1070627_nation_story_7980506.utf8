 Siachen hero falls on LoC

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chunni Lal 

Srinagar, June 26: In his 23 years as soldier and officer, Chunni Lal had led from the front, scripting legendary acts of bravery. He played a key role in the conquest of Siachen and years later helped push back an intrusion by the Pakistan army, winning a Vir Chakra.

 The twice decorated soldier fell fighting militants at north Kashmirs Keran sector on Sunday, but not before killing five of them.

 As a 19-year-old in 1987, Naib Subedar Chunni Lal had fought shoulder to shoulder with Param Vir Chakra winner Bana Singh at Siachen.

 He was among the four of us who reached the top and captured the (21,153ft) Qaid Post after fierce fighting. I remember he was a kid then but fought like a lion, Bana Singh said. He was so pepped up that he screamed we should charge at the enemy.

 The battle won Lal the Sena Medal. In 1999, he achieved an equally memorable feat in Poonch sector during Operation Rakshak, just before the Kargil conflict.

 He fought an attempted intrusion by the Pakistan army and was instrumental in beating back the attack on the post. For this act of gallantry, he was awarded the Vir Chakra (the countrys third-highest gallantry award), defence spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel S.D. Goswami said.

 Years on, as a junior commissioned officer (JCO), the 38-year-old Lal had enough fight left in him as he took on armed intruders in the Keran sector.

 The army noticed some movement and a search party led by Naib Subedar Chunni Lal rushed to the spot in the morning hours of Sunday to ascertain the facts, Lt Col Goswami said.

 The troops were fired upon by a group of militants hiding near the Line of Control. The JCO retaliated immediately with heavy volume of fire. He led from the front, manoeuvred his troops to block all escape routes and killed two fleeing militants at the outset.

 The defence spokesperson said that when the remaining militants found themselves surrounded and outmanoeuvred, they made a suicidal bid to escape, injuring two soldiers.

 Sensing the criticality of the situation and the threat to the lives of his fellow soldiers, Lal, with utter disregard for personal safety, charged at the militants and fired at them. Although wounded and profusely bleeding, he continued to fire at the militants till all the remaining three were killed.

 Lal was born in 1968 in the Bhaderwah area of the state and joined the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry in 1984. He earned laurels for the country on foreign soil, too.

 Floral tributes were paid to the slain hero today at 15 Corps headquarters before his casket was sent home for the last rites.

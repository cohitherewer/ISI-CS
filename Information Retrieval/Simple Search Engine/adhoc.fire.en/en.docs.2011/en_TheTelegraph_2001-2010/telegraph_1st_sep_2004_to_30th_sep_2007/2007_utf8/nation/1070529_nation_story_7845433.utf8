 Army deal with China

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 28: India and China have agreed to hold regular joint military training exchanges and exercises.

 The agreement was reached during a visit of the chief of army staff, General Joginder Jaswant Singh, to Beijing. Singh returned to New Delhi today after a weeks visit to Chinese military installations and talks with his counterparts and leaders of Chinas central military commission.

 Singhs was the first visit by the chairman of the chiefs of staff committee to China in which capacity he led a delegation comprising army, navy and air force officers. It was the third visit by an Indian army chief.

 The visit was aimed at institutionalising military-to-military relations despite a row over the denial of visas to Indian officials from Arunachal Pradesh because China claims nearly all of the northeastern state.

 Just before Singh left for Beijing, an MP from Arunachal alleged that the Chinese army had intruded into the state and had denied Indians access to parts of that territory.

 But the Indian defence establishment is committed to advertising its bonhomie with the Chinese. The army, in particular, is energetic in portraying its relations with Chinas military in a positive light. This contrasts somewhat with erratic diplomatic messages that the current rows reflect.

 We expect the modalities on joint training in some institutions to be worked out following the visit, defence ministry sources said. 

 There was also a move to institutionalise periodic talks at the top level between the two militaries. It is likely that such a mechanism will be set up this year.

 An army statement on Singhs visit said: The visit marked a decision on the engagement and mutual confidence building mechanism by seeking to hold periodic joint military training exercises between the two armies.

 The statement added that the two armed forces have upgraded military-to-military cooperation in a phased manner.

 It began with, the statement said, setting up a peace and tranquillity mechanism along the Line of Actual Control and which has over the past few years graduated to holding cultural and sports events among forces deployed in the border areas.

 The cooperation also saw allowing each others observers at military exercises, extending facility of attending courses of instructions at military training facilities and, finally, leading to inviting high-level visits to each others military establishments, the statement said.

 During his visit, Singh held talks with his counterpart General Liang Guanglie and the vice-chairman of the central military commission, General Guo Boxiong.

 Live feed challenged

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: Nimbus Communications has challenged the ordinance that compels private broadcasters to share live sports feed with Doordarshan.

 With Delhi High Court deciding to hear the petition on Monday a day after the second one-dayer between India and Sri Lanka is played it is likely that Doordarshan viewers will catch the action with a seven-minute delay.

 A day after the information and broadcasting ministry said it might take action against Nimbus for not providing live feed of the Eden match, the Mumbai company which has exclusive broadcast rights to BCCI-organised events in India for four years went to court against the February 1 ordinance.

 The ordinance says private channels must share live sports feed with Doordarshan. This includes all Indias one-day matches wherever they are played and all Tests played in India.

 Nimbus argued yesterday that it did not defy the ordinance, but was awaiting clarifications from the court. At the last hearing the ordinance had not been promulgated then the court had only told the private broadcaster to provide delayed feed. Nimbus holds that till the clarifications come, it is bound by that directive.

 In todays petition, Nimbus said the Sports Broadcasting Signals (Mandatory Sharing with Prasar Bharati) Ordinance, 2007, violates Article 19 of the Constitution guaranteeing freedom of speech and expression.

 Nimbus also said the ordinance violates intellectual property rights. The company claimed the government has no right to come up with an ordinance which has a trans-border impact.

 When the government announced the ordinance, Nimbus had welcomed it saying having regulations was better than the unregulated environment that had existed so far. 

 But it added that it had not seen the ordinance and was unhappy at the possibility of having to share live feed with Doordarshans direct-to-home service as well.

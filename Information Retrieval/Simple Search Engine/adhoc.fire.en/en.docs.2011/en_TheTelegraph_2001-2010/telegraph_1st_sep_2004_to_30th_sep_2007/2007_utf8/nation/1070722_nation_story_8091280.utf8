 Boy found

 Calcutta, July 21: A businessmans son, who went missing from a tutorial in Behala last evening, was found roaming aimlessly in the area today.

 A Class V student of a reputable south Calcutta school, he had apparently not done well in an exam and was scared ahead of a parent-teacher meeting.

 The boy used to live with a teacher in Behala as the parents lived at Rishra in Hooghly district, about 40km away. 

 The parents had left him with the teacher for better education.

 Superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said staying away from parents had left the boy depressed.

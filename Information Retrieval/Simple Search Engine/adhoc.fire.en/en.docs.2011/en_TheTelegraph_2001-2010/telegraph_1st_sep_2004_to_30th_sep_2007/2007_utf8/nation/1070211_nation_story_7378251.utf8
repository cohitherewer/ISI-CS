 Slow probe, fast clean chit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Samuels

 Mumbai, Feb. 10: The probe into the Marlon Samuels-bookie scandal was slow and casual, but the clean chits are coming fast.

 The controversy looks set to be buried with Maharashtra deputy chief minister R.R. Patil echoing Nagpur police stand that there is no evidence of the January 21 Nagpur one-dayer being rigged.

 The real question, however, is whether the game plans that Samuels had revealed to alleged bookie Mukesh Kochchar did affect the betting on the match. But during his informal chat with reporters last evening, Patil, also state home minister, didnt say a word about it.

 The ministers certificate, coming before the arrival of International Cricket Council sleuths, is a pointer that the lid may have been put on the subject. 

 The approach of Patils police and intelligence wings has been equally casual.

 Nagpur police, who caught the West Indies all-rounder talking to Kochchar from his hotel room on January 19 and 20 after a tip-off, stopped tapping the phone on January 21 without arriving at any clear conclusion. No one seems to have made an attempt to find out if the player continued talking to bookies the rest of the tour.

 We continued tapping on January 21, the day of the match, but did not find any conversations between the two, Nagpur police chief S.P.S. Yadav said. We did not continue the surveillance, but informed the state intelligence department. 

 The Nagpur police took their time 17 days in all to send their report to the ICCs Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) and the Board of Control for Cricket in India. The letter to BCCI secretary Shashank Manohar is dated February 7.

 The board, on its part, rushed to declare that no Indian player was involved and promptly passed the police report on to the world body. 

 With the World Cup just a month away, the ICC seems in no hurry. It said an ACSU team would visit Nagpur, adding vaguely that the sleuths would arrive by February 19. 

 The West Indies Cricket Boards probe will involve the West Indies Players Association, of which Samuels is a member.

 Vote in Vishnus name

 Dehra Dun, Feb. 17: The people of submerged Tehri are being asked to vote for the living Vishnu if they want a way out of their misery.

 The god who is a royal actually is offering no miracle, though. After all, he couldnt save his own palace from being swallowed by the Tehri dams reservoir.

 Manujendra Shah, 55, is the BJP candidate for the Tehri Lok Sabha seat against Vijay Bahuguna, the eldest son of former Uttar Pradesh chief minister H.N. Bahuguna. As head of the Tehri royal family, the St Stephens alumnus enjoys the status of Bolanda Badri (incarnation of Vishnu).

 Manujendras father and former MP Manvendra, whose death last month set up the February 21 bypoll, had at first opposed the dam that uprooted thousands from the old Tehri town. But he finally relented, taking part in the dams inauguration last year.

 Manujendra is now courting the early landlosers who were paid far less than those whose plots were acquired later for the dam. The Supreme Court recently nudged the Uttarakhand government to reopen its rehabilitation files and give a fair deal to these first few batches of landlosers, whose number runs into thousands.

 The rehabilitation of the people of Tehri, roads and other facilities are of prime concern to us, Manujendra said.

 The Congress sneers that if the royals were so concerned about Tehri, they wouldnt have sold most of their property and moved to Delhi. But Manujendra will be banking on the goodwill and respect enjoyed by his father, who represented the constituency eight times in the Lok Sabha and defeated Bahuguna by 20,000 votes in 2004.

 The Shah dynasty was set up in 1816, and produced four kings Sudershan Shah, Bhawan Shah, Pratap Shah and Kirti Shah who ruled Tehri till Independence. When the tide of history turned, the Shahs were among the first princely rulers to sign the instrument of merger.

 That former kingdom is under water, but Manujendra wants to cling on to his legacy. He is focusing on the Badrinath temple, of which he is the custodian, responsible for its upkeep and the rituals.

 He has promised that the herbal oil used in temple rituals, which was recently being bought from outside, will again be manufactured in Tehri and all the traditions of the temple will be maintained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Test papers out of reach

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 24: The Central Information Commission today ruled out the disclosure of answer scripts to students even after the examination process is over.

 The commission said it would be next to impossible for bodies conducting large-scale examinations to disclose answer scripts without disturbing the examination set-up.

 It is one of the hardest decisions we have taken but the CIC (commission) felt the examination system could not be destabilised, Wajahat Habibullah, the chief information commissioner, told The Telegraph this evening. 

 So, answer scripts in school-leaving examinations like those conducted by the Central Board for Secondary Education and other boards will now be out of reach for students relying on the Right to Information Act to clear any misgivings about their marks. 

 Answer sheets for competitive examinations to all universities and IITs and IIMs will be shielded, as also those for the UPSC tests.

 This is a sad day for the entire student community, Delhi University students union chief Amrita Dhawan said. 

 There is, however, a thin, silver lining for the student community answer scripts of internally conducted examinations can be shown. 

 In several institutions like Mumbai University promotions from the first year onwards are through internal examinations. Answer scripts in these, the commission said in its 29-page judgment, will have to be made public. 

 But Rakesh Kumar Gupta one of six students who appealed before the commission after his CBSE exam scripts were not revealed accused it of throwing crumbs at students. 

 Most institutions already show their students answer scripts in internal examinations. The lack of transparency is in the mass-scale exams. 

 But the crumbs will benefit government employees.

 Habibullah clarified that government bodies would have to disclose to their employees answer scripts of exams conducted for promotions or transfers. 

 The commission has, however, contradicted itself in todays ruling.

 Last year, when it was less than a year old, it had asked the CBSE to show answer scripts to several students under the RTI act. Delhi University too, had been asked to show answer scripts. 

 As recently as December 2006, the commission had asked the Indian Railways to show the answer script to a job applicant who was concerned whether the paper examined was actually the paper she had submitted.

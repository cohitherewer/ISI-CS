 What chokes Khan Sahab

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR

 New Delhi, June 3: A smooth ride through a string of criminal cases recently got bumpy on a BMW.

 I.U. Khan, who made a mark defending the tainted, found his image stained in the hit-and-run case. The prosecution lawyer was charged with trying to shield Sanjeev Nanda, the prime accused.

 Khan Sahab, as he is called by colleagues and clients, came to Delhi to practise law after getting his LLB degree from Aligarh Muslim University in 1962. He soon became one of the most sought-after defence lawyers in the city.

 About nine years ago, Delhi police decided to use his expertise and put him on their list of special prosecutors.

 In his 45 years of practice, Khan has appeared in several high-profile cases. He argued for Congress leaders H.K.L. Bhagat and Sajjan Kumar in the 1984 anti-Sikh riot cases and defended P.V. Narasimha Rao in the JMM bribery case along with R.K. Anand. Recently, he represented Vikas Yadav and Amardeep Singh Gill in the Jessica Lal murder.

 Designated a senior counsel by Delhi High Court last year, Khan had been representing police in the BMW case from the start. Known for tackling difficult cases with ease, Khan, however, decided to opt out of this one after he was charged with colluding with the accused. He told the trial court he was feeling suffocated.

 But this was not before the police decided to drop him.

 With witnesses turning hostile one after the other, the prosecution had at one stage reportedly supported the idea of dropping key witness Sunil Kulkarni.

 But Kulkarni turned the tables with a sting operation on the alleged nexus between prosecution and defence lawyers to bail Nanda out. 

 Khan, however, said he had been made a fall guy.

 Nuke trust message for Bush

 Berlin, June 6: Whether climate change is just so much hot air will be up to the developed world to decide as its leaders meet for the G8 jamboree at Heiligendamm resort near here in less than 48 hours.

 As for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, he knows that a 15-20 minute meeting with President George Bush on the margins of the G8 could make the difference between success and failure for the UPA government.

 So when Singh meets Bush, he might ask him to take a political call on the two issues holding up the nuclear deal: Indias right to reprocess spent fuel and immunity for a strategic fuel reserve, even if unforeseen circumstances affect the nature of the relationship in the future.

 Shorn of jargon, the implication is that even if India conducts a nuclear test, the US should give a commitment that it will not cut off fuel supplies for the 14 civilian nuclear reactors that Delhi has committed to put under safeguards.

 After last weeks talks between foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon and top US diplomat Nicholas Burns, these were the issues that emerged as the key stumbling blocks.

 Delhi hopes the quick Heiligendamm pull-aside will be long enough for Singh to persuade Bush that he can trust India.

 When Singh met Burns during a courtesy call last week, he is believed to have told him that India would do everything it could to keep its side of the bargain. However, since he had told Parliament that India would do nothing that limits its independence of action, the US would have to trust India on these two issues.

 This question of trust is really the crux of the matter. The US believes that if India gets the right to reprocess only a handful of countries like Japan and Switzerland have got this right, with huge conditions attached it could use the plutonium to make crude bombs.

 Delhi has been telling the US that India will do no such thing. Singh is expected to underline this during his meeting with Bush.

 As for immunity for the strategic fuel reserve, Delhi knows that under US law if it conducts a test, not only will all assistance cease immediately, but the right to return clause will automatically kick in.

 Officials say India will accept the right to return clause only if it is guaranteed immunity for its fuel reserve.

 The right to reprocess spent fuel in Indian facilities, officials say, is a right they will not relinquish as it establishes a certain independence of action. Proposals have been flying thick and fast between the two sides. 

 So far, all that officials were willing to say was that this reprocessing facility would also be put under international safeguards.

 Delhi believes that this right is part of the July 18, 2005, agreement and that the US cannot renege on commitments.

 At that time, too, it was Bush who decided that India, as a rising power, should become a friend, thereby giving the final go-ahead to the agreement. And last year in March, when negotiators on both sides talked for most of the night between March 1-2 Bush arrived late evening on March 1 and the next morning the agreement was signed India offered to put the fuel for the civilian reactors under safeguards.

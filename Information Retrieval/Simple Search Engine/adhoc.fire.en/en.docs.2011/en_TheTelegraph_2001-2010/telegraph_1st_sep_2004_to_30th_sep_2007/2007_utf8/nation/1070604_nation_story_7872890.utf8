 Pranab cites legal hitch

 Shimla, June 3 (PTI): Pranab Mukherjee today said the Bush administration was facing some legal constraints in sealing the nuclear deal.

 A day after the two countries ended their three-day talks in Delhi, the external affairs minister declined to give a time frame by when the deal would be done. 

 He said there were no roadblocks but certain issues needed to be resolved, on which sincere efforts are going on.

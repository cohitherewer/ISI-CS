 Ritual hits science meet

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Sept. 25: Ganesh has hobbled a global science conference after Ram halted the Sethusamudram engineering project.

 The international astronautical congress here was forced to truncate its programmes today after police shifted security personnel to the Ganesh immersion routes.

 Most of the afternoon and evening events at the five-day meet, attended by 2,500 scientists from 45 nations, were cancelled and the delegates rushed to their hotels before the police escorts left. Even the gala dinner was called off.

 The police commissioner told us he could not assure any security to the delegates to return to their hotels once the processions started, an official said at the events venue, the Hyderabad International Convention Centre.

 Security had been beefed up for the event, which comes a month after the August 25 blasts in the city that killed 41 people. The police said they could take no chances with the Ganesh immersion, whose 16km route winds through the minority-dominated Old City.

 We have officially not cancelled all the programmes but only a few, a spokesperson for the science congress said. But only a handful of sessions are learnt to have been held, attended by small groups of delegates staying in nearby hotels.

 Hardly 100 policemen were left around the convention centre since this morning, the spokesperson said.

 The police posted 13,000 personnel along the immersion route from 11am till midnight. We have deployed over 40 bomb squads and 1,000 closed-circuit cameras, police commissioner Balwinder Singh said.

 One reason for the heavy security at the science congress is the attack on the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore two years ago, when a Delhi IIT professor was shot dead outside an auditorium hosting a conference.

 The morning session, however, saw several programmes for the future unveiled. The Indian Space Research Organisation plans to launch a satellite that will provide a direct link to cellphones, making mobile telephony cheaper and widening its reach, chairman G. Madhavan Nair said.

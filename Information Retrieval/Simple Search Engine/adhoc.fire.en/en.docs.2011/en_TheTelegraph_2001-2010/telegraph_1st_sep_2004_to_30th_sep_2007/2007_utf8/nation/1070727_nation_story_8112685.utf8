 BJP echoes Left on N-text

 OUR BUREAU

 Singh, Vajpayee 

 New Delhi, July 26: The government pulled out its star team to brief the BJP on the nuclear deal it has just frozen with the US but the BJP has decided to reserve comment until it sees the text of the agreement.

 Led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the government team consisted of national security adviser M.K. Narayanan, atomic energy chief Anil Kakodkar, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon.

 But, just like the Left parties had done yesterday, the BJP insisted on seeing the letter of the agreement, and not be guided by the spirit of the discussion.

 Delhi has been coy about the text because it has agreed with the Americans that both sides will release the text simultaneously, probably sometime next week.

 Narayanan did much of the talking, assuring the BJP that Indias national interest had been protected and that all concerns over reprocessing rights as well as fuel supply in perpetuity had been taken care of.

 However, the BJP team which included former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Jaswant Singh, Yashwant Sinha, Arun Shourie and Rajnath Singh refrained from making any commitment. Brajesh Mishra was also present during the discussions, but L.K. Advani was absent because he had left for Singapore this morning.

 The BJP leaders said they wanted to know if the Hyde Act, passed in December 2005, which called for annual certifications on a number of issues, would supersede the 123 Agreement. But they said no clear answer was given.

 We are not going to be impressed with smart language. We would first like to see the text of the agreement, one BJP leader said.

 When the UPA decided to first sign the agreement, the BJP had raised four objections: first, there will be no compromise on Indias strategic security; two, no compromise on nuclear sovereignty; three, no compromise on independent direction to foreign policy; four, if the US did not guarantee fuel supply, what would happen to the nuclear reactors on which India had spent large sums of money?

 Moreover, the Prime Minister had said in Parliament that the deal with the US would put India on a par with other nuclear countries. Did that mean that the US would grant Delhi a perpetual waiver as it had done with China under the Atomic Act of 1954?

 There was no satisfactory answer. The Prime Minister only said it was a trade agreement, a BJP leader said.

 However, the BJP also said the nuclear deal should not become the sole benchmark of the relationship with the US, which the party was fully in favour of promoting.

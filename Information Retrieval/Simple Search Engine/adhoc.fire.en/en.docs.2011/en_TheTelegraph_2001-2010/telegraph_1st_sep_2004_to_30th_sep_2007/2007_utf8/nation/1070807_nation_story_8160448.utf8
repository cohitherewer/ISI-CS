 Howard scoffs at Haneef plea

 Melbourne, Aug. 6 (PTI): Australian Prime Minister John Howard today rejected Mohammed Haneefs request for honorary citizenship. 

 I wont be doing that, Howard said. Im not sure we have honorary Australians anyway, but he wouldnt be the sort of person youd make an honorary Australian.

 Haneef, who returned to India after terror charges against him were dropped, had told the media he would like to ask for honorary citizenship because he was a good doctor.

 Im not aware that there is such an animal, such a person, such a beast, Howard said.

 Haneefs lawyer Peter Russo said the doctors family wanted to sue the government for lost income and damage to reputation. Youve got to understand the Indians mentality the mentality is to sue.

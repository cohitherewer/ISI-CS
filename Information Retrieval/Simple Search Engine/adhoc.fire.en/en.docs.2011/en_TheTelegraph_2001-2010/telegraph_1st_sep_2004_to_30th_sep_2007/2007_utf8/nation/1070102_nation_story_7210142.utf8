 Waiting, for the eagles to land

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Thirukazhukundram (Tamil Nadu), Jan. 1: Each afternoon, S. Ramalinga Desigar looks up to the sky for the lost birds, but he hasnt had luck for the past eight years.

 That hasnt stopped the traditional Tamil priest (pandaram), in his late sixties, at the Vedagirishwarar hill temple from doing what he has been for the past 30 years feeding birds with sweetened rice (sarkarai pongal) cooked in the kitchen of the Shiva shrine built by the Palas. Over generations, this has been the only job for his family dishing out the offering to two white eagles, also described as kites in traditional accounts.

 They havent been coming for some time, but the fascination hasnt gone away. According to the Sthala Purana, the eagles (kazhugu) are two sages, Purusha and Vidatha, carrying Shivas curse for their egotism. The two have to worship at this temple, 15 km from the ancient port town of Mamallapuram, till the end of Kalyug to attain liberation or moksha and regain their human form.

 The two birds would come together between 11.30 am and 12 noon. Hundreds waited for the spectacle. The sweet rice was kept in two small bowls and I would feed the birds with my hand. The birds would also swallow some ghee, which used to be kept in a separate bowl, rest for a while and then fly away, Desigar told The Telegraph.

 Not surprisingly, the visit to the place is called pakshi teertham (bird pilgrimage). Desigar, who claims such eagles havent been seen elsewhere in the country, says their majestic, grand look was a delight for people who would gather to watch the ritual.

 Mythology has it that the two birds, being rishis (sages) in another form, have a bath at Kashi in the morning, fly down to Rameshwaram for a sea-dip and wing their way to the hill shrine for food at noon. After this, they are known to spend the night at Chidambaram, also known as the abode of the dancing Shiva, he says.

 In the main temple, stone inscriptions dating back to AD 305 narrate the myth of the two eagles.

 Takeo, a dhoti-attired Japanese, has climbed the hill temples 565 steps, but cant help wonder why the birds stopped coming.

 There is no one answer. Prabhakara Gurukkal, the temples chief priest, says the sages have attained liberation. Locals say painting a part of the shrine in garish colours in 1998 impaired visual signals that birds use to swoop down. Many feel this is a more plausible reason.

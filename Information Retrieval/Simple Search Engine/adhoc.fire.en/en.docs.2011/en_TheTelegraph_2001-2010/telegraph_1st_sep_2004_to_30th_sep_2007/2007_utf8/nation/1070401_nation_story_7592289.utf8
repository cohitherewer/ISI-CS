 Bangalore, March 31: Denied boarding passes, a group of angry passengers booked on an Air Deccan flight threw stones at the airlines booking counter at Bangalore airport early this morning.

 The passengers, who had confirmed tickets for the 5.15 am Bangalore-Mumbai flight, claimed they were not given boarding passes because the low-cost airline had overbooked the flight. 

 As they were leaving the airport, some of them vent their ire on the booking counter.

 We had confirmed bookings. But the airline staff refused to issue boarding passes as they claimed we were late. They even refused to put us on the next flight. I feel the airline has cheated us and overbooked the flight. They issued seats on a first-come-first-served basis, fumed Arun Kumar.

 Air Deccan, however, said its Internet-based reservation system does not leave any scope for overbooking. 

 We are not like other airlines to hold back tickets to be issued to VIPs who land up at the airport at the last minute. We do not put anyone on the waiting list. These 20 passengers were late and the counter had closed. Due to security reasons, we have to close the counter 30 minutes before departure, an official said. 

 Sources blamed the single check-in baggage X-ray machine at the airport, which is shared by three low-cost airlines. Early morning is peak hour at Bangalore airport. One more machine is needed, a source said. 

 As for the broken window of the counter, the airline has so far not registered any case.

 The participants who are to compete in the reality TV show Biggest Loser Jeetega in May with its host Suniel Shetty

 Mumbai, March 27: All you fat men and women whove yo-yo dieted for years and thought of joining gyms or VLCC and drawn back embarrassed, this could be your golden chance.

 Come May, and 16 of Indias fattest people are set to go live on a television reality show to try and lose as many kilos as possible for a huge kitty of prize money that awaits the winner.

 The person losing the most number of kilos over a period of four months will be paid no jokes here a lakh of rupees for each kg he or she loses. So, you could just give those tyres and handles and beer bellies another shot in tandem with the contestants and end up a winner in your own right. After all, if Adnan Sami could, you too can.

 Sahara Ones latest offering is christened Biggest Loser Jeetega and may just make the winner what Big Brother made of Shilpa Shetty, racial ragging and tears apart.

 Sahara is not letting out too many details about the show but participants are expected to be put through rigorous physical training sessions, up to three a day.

 They might also be tempted with the yummiest of high-calorie goodies and junk food but will be expected to draw on daily counselling sessions to shun all of it.

 The show, being shot in Aamby Valley City, will be hosted by actor and fitness freak, Suniel Shetty, and the former physio of the Men in Blue, Andrew Leipus.

 We think the West is obese, but slowly it is happening to India, too. Our diet and training schedules are just not right. If this continues, we will have a bigger and unhealthy generation ahead. Im very excited about my association with this unique show, Suniel, who looks much younger than his 46 years, said.

 In Suniels view, the participants could become celebrities by the time the show is over, and even go on to become brand ambassadors.

 The participants will be split into two teams and trained by Deepika Mehta, yoga and fitness expert, and Yusef Khan, a trainer certified by the International Fitness Association of the US.

 The food aspect will be supervised by Varun Shivdasani. Leading cardiologist Ajit Desai and fitness adviser Leena Mogre will also play an active role.

 Biggest Loser, expected to inspire obese people into shedding their kilos, is a take-off on a global show that went on air in October 2004 in 22 countries. It will be produced by Rahul Agarwal of Star Entertainments.

 India ranks among the top 10 obese nations in the world with about 120 million urbans seriously obese. About 76 per cent women in New Delhi suffer from abdominal obesity, an AIIMS survey said.

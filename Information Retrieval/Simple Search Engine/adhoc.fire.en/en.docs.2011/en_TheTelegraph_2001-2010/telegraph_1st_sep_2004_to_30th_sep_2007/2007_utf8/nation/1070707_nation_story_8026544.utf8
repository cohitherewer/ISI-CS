 Fatwa on co-ed institutes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, July 6: An Islamic seminary has issued a fatwa against running co-educational institutions for Muslims. 

 The diktat, issued by the Deoband-based Darul Uloom yesterday, describes co-educational institutions as unhealthy and says there is no place for them in Islam. 

 The fatwa has sparked a debate among Muslim sects. 

 The fatwa is in line with the Islamic tenets, which say there should be separate schools for women, a cleric said.

 But Shia cleric Maulana Yaqub Abbas dismissed it as an attempt to get cheap publicity. 

 Kalbe Jawwad of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board echoed him. This kind of fatwa is anti-development. There is no direct reference in Islam that women and men cant study together, he said.

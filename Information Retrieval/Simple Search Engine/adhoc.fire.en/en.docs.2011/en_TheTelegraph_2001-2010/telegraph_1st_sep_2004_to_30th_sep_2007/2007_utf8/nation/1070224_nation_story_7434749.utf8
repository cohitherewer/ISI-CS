 Kalam pushes growth for all

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 23: A continuing high rate of inflation is hurting the poor and impeding the UPA governments strategy of inclusive growth aimed at widening the access of all social groups to education, health and employment, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam said today.

 In his address to both Houses of Parliament on the first day of the budget session, Kalam said: Economic growth is not an end in itself. It is a means by which we hope to generate more employment, distribute incomes more equitably across social groups and regions and liberate the poorest of the poor from the scourge of poverty, ignorance and disease.

 Kalams extensive speech revealed the mind of the government, which has been badgered with criticism over soaring prices and inflation.

 The Prime Minister yesterday set up a special cell to monitor inflation, which is hurting the ruling Congress more than any other party. 

 My government recognises that keeping a check on inflation is an essential element of any strategy for inclusive growth, said Kalam.

 The Left parties, however, begged to differ. We do not agree with the Presidents argument that it is because of growth and increased liquidity and an increase in demand that there is price rise. Our argument is that it is an increase in prices of essential commodities which is fuelling inflation, said CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury.

 The President described acquisition of farmland for industry and terms of compensation as issues of major concern. My government is committed to bringing in a new rehabilitation policy, which will be backed by amendments in the Land Acquisition Act wherever necessary, he said, adding that there is a conflict of interest inherent in this development mode. 

 On the one hand, there are genuine concerns of farmers regarding acquisition of agricultural land and, on the other, there is need to use land to generate employment through industry and other related activities, he said. 

 Inclusive growth encompasses a strategy for the welfare of minorities, particularly after the revelations of the Sachar committee report. 

 Referring to the report, Kalam said: We will take all measures necessary to ensure that the fruits of development are shared equitably, and backward minority groups become active participants and beneficiaries of our growth.

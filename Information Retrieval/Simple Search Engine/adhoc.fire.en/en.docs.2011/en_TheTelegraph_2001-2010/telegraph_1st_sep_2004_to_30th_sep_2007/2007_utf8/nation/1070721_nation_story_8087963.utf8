 Pak fisherman killed 

 Karachi, July 20 (Reuters): The Indian Coast Guard opened fire on a Pakistani fishing vessel in disputed waters flowing into the Arabian Sea and one person was killed, a Pakistani maritime official said today.

 The incident occurred in the Sir Creek area, some 90 nautical miles east of Karachi, yesterday.

 The fisherman was killed after Indian coast guards opened fire on his boat, said Lieutenant-Commander Mohammad Shahzad, spokesperson for Pakistans Maritime Security Agency. The boat was in the disputed area, and we have repeatedly asked our fishermen not to venture there.

 No one else was reported hurt, but eight fishermen were arrested.

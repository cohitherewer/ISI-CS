 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Harmony dancer battles obscurity

 Almost 60 years ago, her rhythm of life had stopped a dance of death. Today, few are stepping forward to help her. 

 Muthumari, a veteran folk dancer from Madurai, has come a long way from the dark day of January 30, 1948, when the Father of the Nation fell to his assassins bullets.

 Just 15 then, she got her troupe to stage street-corner campaigns aimed at stopping rampaging mobs provoked by rumours that the Mahatmas killer was a Muslim.

 In doing her bit to avert a communal flare-up, Muthumari was responding to a call for harmony from Muthuramalinga Thevar, a freedom fighter who is no more. 

 The folk idiom and music that she played out in those moments of fear and suspicion are still fresh in her mind. 

 But years later, Muthumari remains unsung and unattended, with little official assistance and few patrons. The music hasnt stopped, nor has rhythm left her. But at 74, she has to hop across temples and villages to present her shows for a living. She deserves better.

 Window of hope at DU

 At a time when admission cut-offs in Delhi colleges are soaring, there is hope for those who have been squeezed out of the scramble. Delhi Universitys School of Open Learning is preparing for the largest number of enrolments ever. 

 For the first time, admissions started on the same day, June 1, as that of other colleges. But the process will continue till August 27, well after admissions elsewhere have stopped. In fact, there is more time since applications with late fees can be sent till October 31. 

 Over 32,000 admission forms for its five under- graduate courses have been sold, and 700 have already enrolled. The initial enthusiasm shows that more students will enrol this year, said H.C. Pokhriyal. The best part, he said, is that all those applying in time will be admitted. 

 New round in name game

 The moon is clearly not good enough for the Andhra government, which prefers something more earthly like green.

 A chain of state-run restaurants and lodges in popular tourist destinations, called Punnami (the moon), will be renamed Harita (green). The new name reflects the zeal of the chief minister, Y.S.R. Reddy, who has been trying hard to sow the seeds of a farmer-friendly image.

 The renaming spree will not come cheap, but a government so obsessed with symbols isnt flinching at the bill. Over Rs 1 crore has been set aside for the big task. 

 At the end of the drive, signboards and display boards at some 27 tourist sites will sport the new names. Since it came to power in 2004, the Reddy regime has replaced NTRs name on some 32 government projects with Rajiv or Indiramma.

 Rajni effect

 Telugu Desam workers had to recently comply with an unusual order from their boss N. Chandrababu Naidu: watch Sivaji The Boss.

 Apparently, Naidu loved the blockbuster so much that he didnt think twice before sending out the uncommon diktat. The sorry state of affairs that Rajni fights against in the movie mirrors the ground reality in Andhra Pradesh now, Naidu is believed to have told his aides.

 Last week, he made his observations official. Whatever is shown in the movie is exactly what is happening in the state now, Naidu told a meeting of village leaders. He was referring to the alarming levels of corruption. If only Naidu could do a Sivaji, life would have imitated art.

 Delhi: Soothe yourself for the coming week with a Carnatic classical vocal recital by Vidya Srinivasan on Monday. The venue is India International Centre Auditorium. Vidya is the granddaughter of maestro .V. Subramaniam. 

 Seating will be on a first-come-first-serve basis. The show starts at 6.30pm.

 Ahmedabad, April 24: The IPS officer who once won accolades for allegedly busting a Lashkar plot to kill Narendra Modi was today arrested on charges of murder.

 Dahyaji Gobarji Vanzara, known as the chief ministers blue-eyed boy, was taken into custody by CID (crime branch) along with colleagues Rajkumar Pandian and Dinesh Kumar for faking the encounter killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh two years ago.

 Vanzara is now inspector-general (border range). Pandian is superintendent of police of the Gujarat intelligence wing and Kumar is a Rajasthan cadre officer.

 Sohrabuddin Sheikh was shot dead on November 26, 2005, in Ahmedabad by a joint team of Gujarat and Rajasthan police as he was whizzing past on a motorcycle.

 The Gujarat anti-terrorist squad, then headed by Vanzara, had claimed he was a Lashkar terrorist out to murder Modi and was gunned down in retaliatory fire by the police.

 The IPS trio were arrested around 12.50 pm in the Gandhinagar police headquarters after prolonged questioning in the presence of Gujarat DGP P.C. Pande.

 They will be produced before the metropolitan court tomorrow where the police will announce charges against them, Pande said.

 The trio have been under fire since March 23 after the Gujarat government admitted before the Supreme Court that the Sheikh killing was staged.

 This was after the court issued a notice to the state on a petition by Sheikhs relatives seeking a CBI probe into his death and the disappearance of his widow Kausar Bano. The CBI said there was need for an inquiry.

 Since March 23, Vanzara who often crowed about his proximity to Modi has been on leave. His Bhuj residence was sealed after his arrest.

 The Congress has demanded an inquiry into all encounter killings that have happened during Modis term. It has urged the BJP to suspend Modi from primary membership of the party for allegedly protecting officers like Vanzara.

 Vitthalbhai Pandya, father of former state home minister Haren Pandya who was killed in March 2003, had earlier pointed a finger at Vanzara.

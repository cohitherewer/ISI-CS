 Gujral son set for House debut

 Chandigarh, March 21 (PTI): Former Prime Minister I.K. Gujrals son Naresh is set to enter the Rajya Sabha from Punjab.

 As no other candidate had filed his nomination for the bypolls in the state and Nareshs papers were found to be in order, he will be declared elected unopposed after the last date of withdrawal of papers tomorrow, N.S. Mavi, the Punjab Vidhan Sabha secretary, said today. Naresh is an SAD-BJP candidate.

 Its now a mere formality, (Naresh) Gujral will be declared elected unopposed tomorrow, Mavi added.

 Delhi-based exporter and SAD political affairs committee member, Naresh was chosen the ruling combines candidate after edging past chief minister Parkash Singh Badals aide Daljit Singh Cheema.

 The Rajya Sabha seat from Punjab fell vacant after the death of Sukhbans Kaur Bhinder of the Congress last year.

 Naresh said he would work to ensure that funds from the Centre to Punjab were not stopped. 

 I will work hard to ensure coordination between the NDA and the UPA at the Centre, he said.

 Haryana Congress working president Ram Prakash is also set to enter the upper House from the state.

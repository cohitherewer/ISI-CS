 Battle begins 

 Back to divisive politics and poll

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Lucknow, April 6: This election was to be about caste but a day before it kicks off, efforts are on to partly redraw the battle lines.

 The portents had come yesterday when an Allahabad High Court judge sought to strip Muslims of their minority status and the Election Commission cracked down on the BJP over a Muslim-bashing CD.

 Although a division bench stayed the judges order today, the Samajwadi Party tried to squeeze it for all its worth and so did to a lesser extent the BJP.

 What kept the BJP from a full-throated cry of minority appeasement was its preoccupation with bailing out its Lucknow (West) candidate, Lalji Tandon, and president Rajnath Singh after non-bailable FIRs were registered against them over the CD.

 But there was no stopping Samajwadi Party spokesperson Virendra Bhatia as he crowed over how the government had burnt the midnight oil to prepare a special leave petition so the judges order could be stayed on a court holiday.

 Mulayam gambit

 The controversy is a bonus for the Samajwadi Party at a time it faces urban anger over the governments alleged patronage of criminals, and polices large-scale recruitment of Yadavs who are accused of working for the ruling party.

 Besides, Beni Prasad Verma and Ajit Singh have dumped the Samajwadi Party and taken along their Kurmi and Jat voters. The upper castes, especially the Thakurs, are looking towards the BJP again after Rajnaths elevation as party chief.

 Mulayam Singh Yadav was therefore counting his losses when the court handed him an opportunity to play on Muslims feelings of insecurity and consolidate their votes.

 This feeling was evident in an announcement by Lucknows Muslim leaders last night that they wouldnt allow processions on the Prophets birthday ever again. Last week, Sunni and Shia processionists had fought bitterly in Lucknow and Kanpur.

 The Muslim leaders fear that their votes, which had consolidated after the Babri demolition, might split again. Their efforts to pre-empt this will help the ruling party.

 BJP woes

 The BJP, too, needs to try and polarise Hindu votes after getting outwitted in the caste stakes by Mayavati.

 The partys hopes to build on its civic poll gains were jolted when the Bahujan Samaj Party handed out the largest number of tickets to Brahmin candidates.

 Teerath Ram Aggarwal, vice-president of the state traders association, said: We, the Banias, are still the BJPs backbone. But even if we vote cent per cent for the party, it cant gain unless the Brahmins join in. Unfortunately, the BJP has lost credibility with Brahmin opinion-makers because it compromised on its core ideology.

 Another setback has been the RSSs decision to stay in the background this election.

 We have issued a general appeal to the public to vote for the party that cares for Hindus. Every party has Hindu leaders its for the swayamsevaks to interpret this message, said Thakur Sanghata Singh, chief of the Sanghs farmer front.

 So, though the high court order was discussed in todays shakhas, Singh said there was no proposal to weave a campaign around it.

 The poll panel action over the CD has been another blow. The party is scrambling to ready a stand-by in case Tandon is barred from contesting.

 Confident Mayavati

 The Samajwadi Party and the BJP may stir the communal water, Mayavati doesnt care. There is a huge groundswell in our favour, especially from the upper castes, BSP spokesperson Sudhir Goel said.

 In Bundelkhand, which includes Mulayams political turf of Etawah, Brahmins said they would vote BSP tomorrow.

 The first and instinctive choice for us Pandits is the Congress. But its weak and lacks the machinery to get the voters out. We would have voted BJP but we are sick of its two-facedness, said Girish Shukla, owner of a tractor agency in Etawah.

 Besides, in an election where law and order is on most peoples minds, Mayavati is seen as a tougher administrator than even the BJPs Kalyan Singh.

 Threadbare Cong

 With Mayavati having more or less captured its once-fabled rainbow coalition of Brahmins, Muslims and Dalits, the Congresss only concern is whether Rahul Gandhis roadshows would mean votes. The alliance with Mahendra Singh Tikaits Bharatiya Kisan Union could bring a couple of seats in the western districts.

 In Bundelkhand, a Congress bastion in the Indira-Rajiv era, the party has no organisation left. Except for seats like Jhansi city and Gharota, where its candidates have their own standing, it promises to be a steep climb for the party.

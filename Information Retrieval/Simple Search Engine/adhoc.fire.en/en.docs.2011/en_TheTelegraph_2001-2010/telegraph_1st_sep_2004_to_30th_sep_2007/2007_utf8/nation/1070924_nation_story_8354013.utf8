 35 years ago, Ram existed for DMK boss

 MANDIRA NAYAR AND M.R. VENKATESH

 Sept. 23: M. Karunanidhi may now dismiss Ram and his setu as mythology but 35 years ago, he had put his seal on a document that spoke of a causeway that Ram constructed to reach Lanka.

 The assertion was made in the June 1972 edition of the Ramanathapuram district gazetteer. Karunanidhi, who was chief minister then, too, wrote the foreword saying modern-day gazetteers were repositories of accurate and authentic information about the land and the people.

 The DMK chief recently said Ram was a fictional character and the lime shoals stretching from the Tamil Nadu coast to Lanka were a natural formation, not a bridge built by the epic heros army.

 The gazetteer, however, says: This is also called by people as Ramar Paalam as it was built by an army of monkeys under Hanumans leadership, with whose assistance Rama invaded Lanka.

 The discovery of the gazetteer, reissued in 1990, has given the Sangh parivar an opportunity to try and embarrass the DMK chief.

 Karunanidhi, who hasnt reacted so far, may argue that a chief minister is not expected to read everything in a district gazetteer. He may also say that all he had meant was that the gazetteer gave accurate information on traditions, that is, what many people believe.

 A modern gazetteer is the most dependable source of information for administrators, scholars and the public on (the) social, political, economic and cultural life of the people, his foreword says. 

 The BJPs Ravi Shankar Prasad said it at least acknowledged the importance of the setu in Indias cultural milieu.

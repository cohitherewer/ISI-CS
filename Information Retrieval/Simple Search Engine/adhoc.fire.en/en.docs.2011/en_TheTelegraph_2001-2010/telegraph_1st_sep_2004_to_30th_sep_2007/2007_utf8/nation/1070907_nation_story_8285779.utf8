 Inquiry into BCCI threat

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kapil Dev

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The cricket board has another headache.

 The countrys anti-monopoly watchdog has ordered a probe into threats by the BCCI to players who joined the rival Indian Cricket League (ICL). The board had warned that cricketers signing up with the League would be banned for life.

 The watchdog, Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission, ordered the probe suo motu, or on its own. The law empowers it to do so if it suspects that an organisation is adopting practices that create a monopoly. 

 The directorate-general of investigation and registration, the wing of the watchdog that will carry out the probe, will also look into the BCCIs expulsion of some former cricket players who have joined the League.

 However, the board denied knowledge of the probe. We havent received any communication from the commission so far, secretary Niranjan Shah said.

 The board had sacked Kapil Dev, who is at the helm of the rival body, as chairman of National Cricket Academy.

 Shah today denied having issued any threat. We have not threatened cricketers who joined ICL in any way. 

 If the board is found to have acted against the interests of players who have left for the League, the watchdog may pass a cease and desist order. Such a decree requires a person or organisation to stop the wrongful practice (cease) immediately and not repeat it in future (desist). 

 Delhi High Court had last month asked PSUs Air India and Indian Oil to refrain from sacking their players who had joined the League.

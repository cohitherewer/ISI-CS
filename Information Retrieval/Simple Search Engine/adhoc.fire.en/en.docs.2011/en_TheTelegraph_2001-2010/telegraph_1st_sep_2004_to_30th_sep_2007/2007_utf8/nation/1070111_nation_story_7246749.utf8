 Sidhu set to surrender

 Chandigarh, Jan. 10: Navjot Singh Sidhu, facing a three- year jail term for causing the death of a man, said he would surrender before Punjab and Haryana High Court tomorrow.

 I will submit myself before the law tomorrow as my appeal to the Supreme Court seeking stay of my conviction is to be heard on January 12, Sidhu (in picture) said.

 The former cricketer, who resigned as BJP MP after the verdict in the 18-year-old case, is currently on bail.

 FIR against Uma over Ram Setu speech

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, July 8: A first information report has been filed against Uma Bharti for her alleged provocative statements over Adams Bridge.

 The Bharatiya Jan Shakti party leader was addressing a meeting at Tiruchirappalli last night and spoke against the proposed demolition of the bridge locally referred to as Ramar Setu that would make way for the Sethusamudram Ship Canal Project.

 If anyone touches Ramar Setu, we will mobilise Hindus in large numbers at the pil grim-island of Rameswaram and we are ready to sacrifice any number of them for this cause, police sources said today, quoting Uma .

 The issue raised political passions after government scientists suggested that an islet chain in the Palk Strait is man-made, triggering claims that it is the remnant of the bridge Rams mythological monkey army built to Lanka.

 The Rs 2,427-crore project, which requires the bridge to be demolished, will save the country Rs 1,000crore a year as it will shorten shipping routes.

 The FIR was lodged on a complaint by the Fort area station inspector, sources told The Telegraph over telephone. Two of Umas party activists have also been charged, but no arrests have been yet.

 The case has been filed under Section 153 (A) of the Indian Penal Code promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, etc, and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony as well as Section 506 on criminal intimidation.

 Offences under these two sections, if proved, could invite a jail term of seven years.

 Uma also announced that her party would organise a week-long satyagraha in Rameswaram from July 24 to press the Centre to stop the project immediately.

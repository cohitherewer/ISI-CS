 Govt claims final word on EC

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR

 New Delhi, May 9: The Centre today told the Supreme Court that the cabinet was the final authority to decide whether to remove an election commissioner.

 NDA MPs had submitted a representation to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam seeking the removal of Naveen Chawla, who they alleged was close to the Congress. 

 BJP leader Jaswant Singh, who filed a petition seeking a directive for a proper course of action on the representation by 205 MPs, has been contending that the President should have directly sought the opinion of the chief election commissioner instead of referring it to the cabinet.

 But additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam argued that the President did not have the power to seek an opinion from the poll panel chief except on the cabinets advice.

 He added that the cabinet had decided not to seek the opinion of the panels chief as it did not find any merit in the representation. Even if the panels chief recommends removal, the opinion is not binding on the cabinet, he said.

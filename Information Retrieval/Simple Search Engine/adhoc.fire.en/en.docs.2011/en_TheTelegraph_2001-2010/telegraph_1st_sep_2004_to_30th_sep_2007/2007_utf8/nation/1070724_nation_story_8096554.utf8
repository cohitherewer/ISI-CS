 Monica freedom hope

 Hyderabad, July 23: The Supreme Court today waived the passport-surrender condition that had come in the way of Monica Bedi and her release from a jail here, reports our special correspondent.

 The actress could walk free by Wednesday, by when copies of the court order should be filed before the CBI court. In all likelihood, copies of the Supreme Court order will be submitted on Wednesday and she may be released soon, said her lawyer Pradeep Kumar. 

 A bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan asked the regional passport office in Mumbai to cancel Monicas passport and told the special CBI judge in Hyderabad to consider her release on bail.

 Monica claims she lost the passport in Dubai three years ago.

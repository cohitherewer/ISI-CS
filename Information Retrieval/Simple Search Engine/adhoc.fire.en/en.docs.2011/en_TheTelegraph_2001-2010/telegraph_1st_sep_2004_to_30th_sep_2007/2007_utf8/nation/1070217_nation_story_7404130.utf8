 Comrades cartridges

 Chennai, Feb. 16 (PTI): Kerala CPM secretary Pinarayi Vijayan was detained at Meenambakkam airport by CISF personnel for possessing five rounds of live catridges used in .38 rifles. 

 Vijayan, who arrived from Kochi this evening, was about to board a flight to New Delhi when a baggage scan revealed the cartridges, airport sources said. 

 He was let off after he explained that he had a licence for the rifle. 

 Vijayan missed the flight and will leave for Delhi tomorrow.

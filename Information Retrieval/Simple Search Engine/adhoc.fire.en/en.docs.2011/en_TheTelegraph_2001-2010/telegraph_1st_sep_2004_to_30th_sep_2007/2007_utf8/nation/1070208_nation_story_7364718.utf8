 Cong wants FDI shield in retail

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: The Congress clarified today that it was not in favour of banning foreign direct investment in retail but wants adequate safeguards to protect the interests of small retailers and provision stores.

 The clarification came as the Prime Ministers Office sought from the commerce ministry details of the policy on FDI in retail following a letter by Sonia Gandhi to Manmohan Singh that referred to the Wal-Mart deal with Bharti for a joint venture.

 The commerce ministry had earlier said the proposal is in conformity with foreign investment rules as it is expected to confine itself to back-end operations. Under existing guidelines, FDI in single-brand and back-end operations are permitted but multi-product stores are not allowed.

 Fielding questions on Sonias letter, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said she and the party believed in adopting the middle path on retail. 

 The party, he added, was not in favour of taking extreme positions. It (the letter) should not be seen as two extremes of banning FDI or allowing FDI without any safeguards. The spirit and the message of the letter is that before any such important policy is operationalised, full safeguards should be taken to protect the interests of the aam admi.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath, who will meet the Prime Minister shortly to discuss the Wal-Mart proposal, said the PMO had asked for details of the retail policy and we have sent our comments.

 What is the fuss all about? Nath asked, adding that FDI in retail is not allowed now and no such agreement has been signed by anyone. 

 Asked what checks and balances Sonia had in mind, sources said since retail was a huge area that covered onions to ACs, care should be taken to ensure that prices of essential commodities are reined in and not subject to market vagaries and speculation.

 While confirming that Sonias letter mentioned Wal-Mart by name the full document is likely to be reproduced in the next issue of the Congresss in-house journal Sandesh the sources denied that the party was a player in the competitive wars in retail. 

 However, the sources indicated that the Congress would not put big Indian players and foreign firms on a par. Big domestic players and foreign direct investors are not the same, a source said.

 But if checks and balances were institutionalised, these should apply to Indian players as well, he added.

 FDI in retail is expected to be discussed by the Congress Working Committee, which could meet before the budget session starts. Last month, the commerce ministry has given the green signal to the Wal-Mart venture with Bharti. The decision was expected to pave way for the entry of other retail majors such as the UKs Tesco and Frances Carrefour. 

 But Sonias letter has apparently put a spoke in the wheel. She wrote: I have received suggestions from many quarters about the desirability to first study the possible impact of transnational supermarkets on the livelihood security of those engaged in small-scale operations.

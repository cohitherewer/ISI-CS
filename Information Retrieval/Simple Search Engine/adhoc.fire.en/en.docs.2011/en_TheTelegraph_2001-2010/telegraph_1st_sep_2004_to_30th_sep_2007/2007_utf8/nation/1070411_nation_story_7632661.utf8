 Pepsi wins round against panchayat

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Apr-il 10: PepsiCo today pulled off a legal victory when Kerala High Court ruled that a local panchayat could not withhold renewal of its licence as it did not have jurisdiction over industrial estates.

 The soft drink giants bottling plant is located in Keralas Kanjikode industrial belt in the Pudussery panchayat of Palakkad district.

 The panchayat turned down the licence renewal application by PepsiCo India Holdings Private Ltd on August 22, 2003, citing that its bottling plant had been overdrawing groundwater. But PepsiCo continued to operate on the strength of a conditional stay by the high court.

 Today, Kerala High Court acting Chief Justice K.S. Radhakrishnan and Justice M.N. Krishnan ruled that the Panchayat Raj Act did not apply to industrial areas.

 The Left Democratic Front government in Kerala will appeal against the verdict, chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan said. The court order has not honoured the panchayati raj and we will appeal against it after consulting legal experts, he said. 

 The court, however, has directed the Groundwater Authority to verify the panchayats charges of groundwater exploitation.

 The panchayat in Pudussery is controlled by the CPM, which has been spearheading the battle against the multinational companies at various levels. Its president K. Suresh termed the verdict an encroachment on local self-government rights. The judges have passed the judgment without ascertaining the facts. The verdict has made the Panchayat Raj Act redundant, he said.

 Environmentalists campaigning against Coca-Cola and PepsiCo called the verdict retrograde. 

 The green brigade had won a minor battle when the state government banned Coke and Pepsi last year, but the high court lifted the ban, saying the government held no powers to curb the production and sale of the soft drinks. 

 The Kerala government then moved the Supreme Court but failed to get a stay on the high court verdict. 

 PepsiCo also suffered a hiccup in March when the revenue department sealed its factory for tax arrears of Rs 2 crore. The plant, however, reopened in 24 hours after a payment of Rs 1 crore.

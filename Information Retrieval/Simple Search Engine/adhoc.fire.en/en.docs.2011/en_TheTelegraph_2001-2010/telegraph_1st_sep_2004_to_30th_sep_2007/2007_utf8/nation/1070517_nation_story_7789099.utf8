 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 16: The anti-terror court hearing the 1993 blasts case today directed the prosecution to produce reports of probation officers on those who have sought release under the Probation of Offenders Act.

 Judge Pramod Kode had earlier said he would pass orders on May 16 on the applications filed under the act by actor Sanjay Dutt (in picture) and three of his friends but would keep them confidential till May 18, when he starts pronouncing the sentences.

 Kode today told the special public prosecutor to furnish information on whether the state had appointed probation officers and asked for a detailed list by tomorrow.

 The court also asked the prosecution to produce the probation officers reports on some of the accused but did not indicate whether the Bollywood star was among them.

 Sanjay and his friends have been convicted under the less stringent Arms Act and face a maximum jail term of 10 years.

 Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam asked the court if it would wait for the arrival of the probation officers reports or start sentencing from May 18. I have said earlier that I will start delivering the quantum of sentence from May 18, Kode replied. And I am going to deliver the sentences from that day.

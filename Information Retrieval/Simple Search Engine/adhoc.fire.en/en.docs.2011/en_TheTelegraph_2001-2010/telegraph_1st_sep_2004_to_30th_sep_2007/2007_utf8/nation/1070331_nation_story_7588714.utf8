 Rivals claw at Cong

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mayavati (top) and Mulayam 

 Lucknow, March 30: The interim stay on OBC quotas has come from the apex court but it is the Congress that has been left carrying the can.

 A day after the Supreme Court cited a backdated census report to stall the 27 per cent reservation for other backward classes in IIMs and IITs, political rivals Mayavati and Mulayam Singh Yadav have dug their claws into the Congress for not handling the issue properly.

 The Congresss ignorance of ground realities of the OBC population made it quote the 1931 census report. Had the Congress built a proper database, the Supreme Court would not have stalled the quotas, Mayavati said today.

 Grabbing the issue to spice up the campaign for the Uttar Pradesh elections, the Bahujan Samaj Party chief said there was a disconnect between the Congresss policies and intentions, which had forced the courts hand. 

 Inki neeti evam niyat mein antar hai, jiske kaaran yeh faisla aaya hai, she said.

 Mayavati also dragged in V.P. Singh, who implemented the Mandal commission report, for attack. Congress policies are no different from V.P. Singhs when he was Prime Minister in 1989. He had made this mess, too.

 She said there should be no doubt in the minds of OBCs that she had taken the issue very seriously. 

 Although there is little the Congress could have done to change the outcome of the quota order, it has no alternative but to bear the brunt of the attacks as it heads the coalition at the Centre.

 Mulayam, too, smacked his lips at the Congresss discomfort, getting back at the party at an Agra rally over the recent Presidents rule ruckus.

 The Congress was trying to dislodge me from power but it is embroiled in its own half-hearted efforts, including the quota mess, he said. 

 I am getting the Supreme Court order to understand its implications but we believe the issue should not have been casually handled.

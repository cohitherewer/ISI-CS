 Kauser flip-flop

 New Delhi, Aug. 20 (PTI): The Gujarat government today told the Supreme Court it had no information about the time and manner in which Kauser Bi, the wife of alleged extortionist Sohrabuddin Sheikh, was killed by the state police.

 Although it had information that Kauser, after being intercepted in Andhra Pradesh, was shifted to the Arhan farm house in Gujarat, there was no further data on her whereabouts, senior counsel K.T.S. Tulsi said.

 The submission comes after the states earlier admission that after killing Sohrabuddin in a fake encounter, Kauser was killed to destroy evidence. The state had also said she was killed and later cremated by the accused police personnel.

 Child labour scheme shame

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 

 only work, no school

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: Only three out of 100 child labourers have made it to school, new government data has revealed, nineteen years after India launched its ambitious programme to put every such child in a classroom. 

 Faced with the weight of its own statistics, the Centre appears to have accepted the failure of the National Child Labour Policy started by Rajiv Gandhis government in 1988. 

 A Planning Commission working group on child labour has recommended detailed changes to the policy ahead of the 11th five-year plan. 

 The recommendations have been accepted by the ministry of labour, which is in charge of fighting child labour. 

 The number of child workers in India rose from 11.3 million in 1991 to 12.7 million in 2001. 

 Statistics collated from a state-wise evaluation of the policy at the end of 2006 have revealed that only 374,255 children have been successfully taken out of work and put in school since it was launched. 

 If the 2001 census figure is taken as the total number of child labourers in India since the policy was launched, less than 3 per cent have received the education promised. 

 The total number of child labourers since 1988 would actually be larger, so our success ratio would be even lower. The figures are shocking... even to us, said a senior labour ministry official, who handles child labour issues. 

 The truth is we need a big change. The child labour scheme has great intentions, but success has been, and remains, invisible.

 The labour ministry has long complained that it is unable to focus on rescuing children as it is also saddled with the job of educating them in temporary schools while the details of the childs permanent schooling are worked out. 

 That appeal appears to have been heard the Planning Commission and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights both want the policy to be linked to the Sarva Shisksha Abhiyan. 

 The HRD ministry should be responsible for the temporary schooling apart from the final, permanent schooling that they are in charge of. They are best equipped to take care of education, Shanta Sinha, the chairperson of the child rights commission, said.

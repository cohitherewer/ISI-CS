 Fine for disabling surgery

 New Delhi, Jan. 1 (PTI): Nine years after a 70-year-old woman became disabled following unsuccessful surgeries on her fractured legs at Delhis Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, the state consumer commission has awarded Rs 50,000 as compensation.

 The Delhi state consumer disputes redressal commission, headed by Justice J.D. Kapoor, held the elite private hospital guilty of deficiency in service as no clinical tests, including X-ray, were done before proceeding with the surgery on Vidyawati. 

 The commission asked the hospital to make the payment in a month to Asha Gupta, her daughter.

 In August 1997, Vidyawati was admitted to the hospital after she fell in bathroom, leading to a fracture in her right leg. Her left leg also needed surgery. But the operation to fix the bones failed, rendering her disabled.

 The commission rejected Apollos argument that it could not be held liable as the patient was suffering from acute osteoporosis, a disease, which weakens bones.

 It also took strong exception to the hospital not discharging Vidyawati even after the surgery. 

 Another deficiency the hospital can be accused of is the unnecessary retention of the complainant under the excuse of treatment, Kapoor said.

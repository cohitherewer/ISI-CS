 Marxists too need movie stars

 Chennai, May 8: He whizzes around in a swanky red Merc, wears Levis jeans and Crocodile T-shirts, and sports Ray-Ban glares and Nike shoes. He is also Keralas reigning superstar and a top draw with women.

 Big deal, the Marxists for whom globalisation and glamour count for zilch would say. So what was Mammooty doing at a CPM youth wing meet today?

 In a sign that the CPM, too, could be turning to film stars to catch the eye of the young, Mammooty was heard making a clarion call to the youth in his opening speech at the Democratic Youth Federation of India meet.

 The energy of youth is like atomic energy which can be used for constructive purposes like generating electricity or (it can be) used for destruction. Be the atomic energy to construct, to give power to the people, he said.

 Dressed in casual trousers and a shirt none of his usual branded stuff was on display Mammooty was quite unusually the star draw at the Strengthen Indias Future: Invest in Youth meet.

 DYFI national president K.N. Balagopal glossed over the aberration, saying the invite to Mammooty was in honour of his brave rejection of Coca-Colas offer to be its brand ambassador.

 Mammootys opting out means people in their respective fields are carrying on struggles for the general cause of the people. We, in the Marxist party, have the tradition of enlisting the support of such public-spirited people who conduct individual struggles, he said, as politburo member Sitaram Yechury looked on.

 Although Balagopal sang paeans to Mammooty, there was no way the star could have endorsed Coke. Not only is he the chairman of the CPMs television channel Kairali, he could not have struck a jarring note when the party was protesting against the cola majors overexploitation of groundwater in Kerala.

 This is the first time that a star of Mammootys stature some of his roles may be considered decadent by the Lefts apasanskriti brigade that stopped Usha Uthup from performing in Calcutta has been seen at such a CPM forum.

 There have been a few smaller names, though. Malayali actor Murali was fielded by the CPM against the Congresss V.M. Sudheeran in an Alappuzha election. But Murali was trounced.

 Then in Bengal, actor Mithun Chakrabortys political sympathies for the CPM are well known. But he has not been fielded on such a platform.

 The late actor, Anil Chatterjee, was given a CPM ticket and went on to become an MLA. Biplab Chatterjee contested against Tapas Pal in the last Bengal elections.

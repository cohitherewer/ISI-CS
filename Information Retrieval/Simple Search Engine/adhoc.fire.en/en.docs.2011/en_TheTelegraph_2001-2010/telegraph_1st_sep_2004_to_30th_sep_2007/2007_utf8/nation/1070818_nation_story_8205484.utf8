 Terror troops 

 New Delhi, Aug. 17: The Centre has said there will be no reduction of troops from counter-insurgency duties even as a committee constituted by it is preparing to submit a report on Kashmir. 

 The committee, headed by the defence secretary and reporting to the defence minister, was formed after Mufti Mohammed Sayeeds Peoples Democratic Party asked for reduction of troops in Jammu and Kashmir.

 The government has said in an action-taken report to a parliamentary panel that it was not feasible to withdraw the army from counter-insurgency responsibilities.

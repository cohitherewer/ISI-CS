 Sleuths smell out delayed kits trail

 Mumbai/Nagpur, Feb. 12: As sleuths from the world cricket body began probing the Marlon Samuels-bookie scandal, police picked up a new scent the delayed arrival of the West Indies teams kits.

 Nagpur police today told the visiting four-member ICC team to investigate why the kits reached the ground late on the morning of the January 21 one-dayer, which the hosts won.

 Commissioner S.P.S. Yadav revealed the new aspect of the controversy at a news conference this evening and said it was up to the ICC team to probe whether the delay had any connection with the outcome of the match.

 The kits arrived from Lahore via Mumbai and reached the stadium in Nagpur at 9.30. The toss was at 8.50. West Indies won the toss and, though it was a batting pitch, chose to field. We found it quite unusual. Did someone deliberately delay the arrival of the kits is something the ICC should probe? said a Nagpur police officer.

 Sixteen kits, weighing 436 kg, apparently arrived in Mumbai on January 20 evening from Lahore, Pakistan. Though there is a 6 am Indian flight to Nagpur, the kits arrived by a Jet Airways flight and reached the ground only after the match started.

 Cricketing sources said the West Indians arrived in the subcontinent on a long Asian tour starting with a tri-series in Malaysia, followed by the Champions Trophy in India, and a Pakistan tour, and returned home after the Pakistan tour concluded on December 16.

 The reason why the kits arrived from Pakistan, while the team arrived from the Caribbean, is unclear. It is possible that the West Indies team management asked the Pakistan Cricket Board to take custody of the kits before leaving for home and dispatch them in time for the Nagpur one-dayer, the sources said.

 The ICC team officials Anti Corruption and Security Unit investigators Jeffrey Rees and Allan Peacock, media and communications manager Brian Murgatroyd and the ACSUs Delhi-based regional security manager N.S. Virk arrived in Nagpur last evening. They met deputy commissioner Amitesh Kumar, who handled the probe into Samuels phone conversations with alleged bookie Mukesh Kochchar.

 Police commissioner Yadav said his department has written to the ministry of external affairs and the Maharashtra government for permission to hand over the material, including tapes of the conversations, that the ICC team has asked for.

 We are trying to establish what information they have. We will look into all possible angles, but restrict the probe purely to cricket, Murgatroyd said. No time frame has been finalised by the ICC to complete the probe.

 He said the scandal has erupted barely a month before the World Cup in the Caribbean and we should all be vigilant in the interest of the game.

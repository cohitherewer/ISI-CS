 School meal makes kids ill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Sept. 28: Over 280 primary students had to be rushed to hospital after having midday meals served by two schools on the outskirts of Moradabad yesterday afternoon. 

 Eighty-two of them are fighting for their lives.

 The children have fallen prey to the faulty implementation of the scheme, a central plan aiming to fight hunger, at a time when the Centre is announcing one aam aadmi scheme after another with an eye on a possible early election. 

 A rural job plan restricted to over 330 districts was extended to the rest of the country today. 

 But as the incident showed, the students of Badalpur Primary School and Uttampur Primary School, who had the puri subzi lunch, might have been better off hungry on Thursday afternoon.

 About half an hour after having the meal, I felt my head spin and soon I began to vomit, said Pooja, a nine-year old girl admitted to the Moradabad district hospital. 

 Dr Veer Singh, who attended to the students, said that of the 280 children who came to the hospital, 82 had to be admitted because their condition was serious. The rest were sent home after preliminary treatment and medicines. We have sent the food samples for tests, said Singh. 

 Girish Chandra, the Samajwadi Party MLA from the area, blamed the contractor who had supplied the food items. Six persons have already been arrested, including the panchayat member and six associates of the contractor.

 This is not the first time students have fallen ill after having food served by schools under the scheme, which is run by the Centre with contributions from states to pay for the cost of ferrying grain and cooking facilities. In June 2006, 12 children fell ill after having lunch in a Meerut school.

 Under the meal scheme, which aims to lure poor children to school, foodgrain is supposed to be procured from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) but there have been complaints about school authorities and contractors colluding to supply poor quality food from shops. 

 There have also been allegations of funds being siphoned off by padding student numbers. A school in Bulandshahr with 939 students on its register was found to actually have only 134 during an inspection this February. 

 We dont have adequate funds for the scheme but these irregularities are draining the education departments resources, said Raj Pal Singh, the assistant director, primary education, in the Meerut division. The Uttar Pradesh government has set aside Rs 20 crore as its contribution to the scheme for this financial year. 

 Earlier, the rules of the scheme required Dalit women, preferably widows or divorcees, to be hired as cooks but the job was given to contractors after a controversy erupted over some upper-caste students refusing to eat meals prepared by members of backward classes.

 According to the ministry of planning, there are 20 million children below the age of 11 in India. Of these, about 8 million are forced to work instead of going to school. In Uttar Pradesh, 1.7 million children have to skip classes. The meal scheme intends to reach out to such students.

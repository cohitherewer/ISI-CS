 Kashmir committee

 New Delhi, March 26: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to make an announcement on Jammu and Kashmir in the next couple of days to buy peace and time with Congress ally, the Peoples Democratic Party, and try and stabilise the coalition government in the state, reports our special correspondent.

 Congress sources said Singh was expected to announce the formation of a high-level committee to go into the issue of de-militarisation, which PDP leader and former chief minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed had demanded.

 With the Centre and the chief minister, Ghulam Nabi Azad, opposed to immediate reduction of troops, sources said a committee was the only face-saver for both sides.

 Loyal Left quiet on election 

 OUR BUREAU

 Aug. 22: The first day of the CPM central committee session saw many members endorsing the tough politburo stand but it also heard voices that advocated caution on pushing the country to early polls.

 Sources said CPM general secretary Prakash Karat told the meeting that the UPA has yet to reply to the Lefts demand of not proceeding further to operationalise the Indo-US nuclear deal. Karat said the UPA government is yet to send a formal reply, a central committee member said. 

 In the event of the government not coming out with a formal reply, the partys approach would depend on what atomic energy chief Anil Kakodkar does in Vienna at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) meeting next month.

 According to the sources, the Left would be closely following Kakodkars visit to see if he only attends the IAEAs General Assembly or discusses the safeguards agreement.

 Asked how long the Left parties would wait, a central committee member said: September 18 (when Kakodkar travels to Vienna) is crucial. We will wait till then.

 PTI quoted politburo member Sitaram Yechury as saying: All we are asking from the government is to press the pause button. It should properly evaluate all the implications before proceeding further. 

 The opinion on the first day echoed that of the politburo which had served a virtual ultimatum on the Centre. If the highest leadership of the party has taken a tough stand, they have the guts to carry it out. The crisis has been triggered by the Congress, so it has to decide how to come out of it, central committee member Mohammad Salim said.

 Fellow committee member and Bengal party veteran Benoy Konar indicated that the party would not like to burn the bridge on its own as it did not want to be blamed for imposing a mid-term poll on the country.

 The whole party is united and endorsed the rejection of the Indo-US nuclear deal. But we will try our best to allow the government to reconsider its position as long as possible. The ball will be in the Congresss court regarding the question of withdrawal of Left support, Konar said. 

 The CPI, too, has called a two-day emergency meeting of its national executive on August 28 to decide on the next steps in the developing situation.

 The Bengal Left Front has lined up public programmes, including a grand rally in Calcutta on September 1, to mobilise opinion against the deal.

 Gir lions hostage to Gujarati pride

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 An Asiatic lion in Gir

 New Delhi, June 3: Gujarati pride a term Narendra Modi invokes to his advantage in every crisis now threatens the existence of Asiatic lions in the Gir forests.

 The endangered lion, whose only habitat is this sanctuary in Junagadh in southwest Gujarat, desperately needs a second home. 

 The main threat to the lions existence is excessive in-breeding that could lead to genetic abnormalities. The sanctuary has over 325 lions in an area of 1,400 sqkm. 

 Experts say the number is too high and exposes the lions to the risk of being wiped out in case of a natural calamity or an epidemic.

 The Centre, therefore, set up the 344-sqkm Kuno-Palpur sanctuary in Sheopur district, Madhya Pradesh, to relocate the animals. 

 But then Gujarati pride reared its head.

 Conservation efforts have been exceptional in Gujarat, the state chief wildlife warden, Pradeep Khanna, said. 

 The population has increased and we have also increased the geographical area. The Gujarat governments position is that we do not need to relocate.

 All environment secretary Pradipto Ghosh could do was issue fresh appeals to the authorities in Gujarat.

 I know it is a matter of Gujarati pride. But they should understand that the lion is also a symbol of Indian pride. It is our national emblem.

 I have no power to pressure them. I can only appeal to their good sense. Please help relocate the Gir lions for their survival. 

 The relocation project, spanning 20 years, will cost about Rs 640 million. The lions will be tranquillised and transported by air to the sanctuary. 

 There they will be acclimatised at a pre-release centre before being let out in the wild.

 We have spent a lot of money. I hope the Gujarat government relents, Ghosh said.

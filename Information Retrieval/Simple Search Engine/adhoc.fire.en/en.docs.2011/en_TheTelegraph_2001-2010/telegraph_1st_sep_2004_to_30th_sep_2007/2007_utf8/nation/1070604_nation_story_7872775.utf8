 Absent Amisha angers fans

 Amisha: Lesson looms

 Ahmedabad, June 3: Amisha Patels fans had gone wild.

 The night of the star had rolled past midnight, but where was the star?

 Hundreds of fans of the actress went on the rampage after Amisha, who was scheduled to perform at a charity dance show in a Surat indoor stadium last night, failed to turn up.

 Police said the crowd went berserk and damaged the stadium, though no one was injured in the ruckus.

 Throughout the evening, the organisers Rajasthan-based Vinayak Vidhya Pith, which runs schools and hostels in the states rural areas had kept telling the increasingly restless audience that Amisha was stuck in a traffic jam and would arrive any moment.

 But around 12.15, when the organisers themselves had vanished from the venue, it became clear that the actress was not coming. 

 Then the chairs began to fly.

 Police sources said the angry crowd also demanded that the organisers refund their money.

 The show, dubbed star night, had been given a lot of publicity. Local television channels had been running promos of the concert and the tickets, priced between Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000, had been sold with the promise that Amisha would be performing.

 The organisers, who wanted to raise Rs 2 crore and send the money to their home state for constructing hostels, are now planning to sue the actress for breach of contract.

 J.C. Somani, one of the groups trustees who live in this diamond city of Gujarat, said he was shocked that Amisha didnt turn up.

 She was given Rs 2 lakh in advance for the concert and had agreed to perform, Somani said. We have her confirmation letter.

 The organisers today approached Surat police to lodge a complaint against the actress but were told to do so in Mumbai as the contract had been signed there.

 The police, however, said they would lodge a case against those who had ransacked the stadium.

 A spokesman for the group said they are determined to teach Amisha a lesson for betraying the organisation, which is involved in a noble cause.

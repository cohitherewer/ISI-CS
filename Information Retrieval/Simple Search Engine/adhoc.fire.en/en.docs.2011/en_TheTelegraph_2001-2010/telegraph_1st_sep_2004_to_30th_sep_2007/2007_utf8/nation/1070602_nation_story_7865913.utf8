 Jyoti Basu

 Jyoti Basu has appealed to Mamata Banerjee to facilitate the return of the homeless to Nandigram.

 About 2,500 supporters of our party are in camps and some from her party, too, are homeless. So, I request Mamata to facilitate restoration of peace in Nandigram, Basu said, urging the Trinamul Congress chief to attend the second round of talks.

 Reacting to Basus appeal, Mamata said: We took the peace initiative first. We did not wait for Jyotibabus advice.

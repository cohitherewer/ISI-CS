 Stick for channels

 New Delhi, Jan. 13: Broadcast regulator Trai has served notice to two sports channels to reduce the amount they charge cable operators, sending a signal to broadcasters that they must toe the price line.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has asked Mumbai-based Nimbus Sports Broadcast Private Limited to slash the wholesale price of Neo Sports and Neo Sports Plus channels. 

 In non-CAS areas, Nimbus has been asked to scale down its price from Rs 58.50 per month for a bundle of both channels to the prevalent rate of Rs 37.25. 

 In CAS-notified areas, Nimbus must stick to the Rs 5 per month plus tax ceiling, Trai has said. 

 Nimbus has been asked to comply within a week.

 Sins of sons revisit leaders

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 July 30: The dowry harassment case against Arjun Singh lengthens the list of politicians paying for the perceived sins of their progeny.

 From Morarji Desai to Jagjivan Ram to P.V. Narasimha Rao to Ajit Jogi, sons have landed their politician papas in one controversy after another.

 If Indira Gandhi had her share of troubles when Sanjay Gandhi was coming of age in politics, Jyoti Basu, too, was no stranger to controversy over his son when the Marxist patriarch was in power. 

 Almost in all cases, the politicians found it impossible to dissociate themselves from the deeds of their wards even if they themselves may have had little to do with the scandals.

 Take Arjuns son Abhimanyu for instance. Two years ago, when his grandson got married to Priyanka of Chandausi, Uttar Pradesh, the HRD minister and his wife were not even invited.

 At another famous family wedding between Arjuns grandson Ashwariya (son of daughter Beena) and Nepalese princess Devyani Rana, both his sons Abhimanyu and Ajay were conspicuous by their absence.

 Morarji Desais son Kantibhais financial deals brought the then Prime Minister so much embarrassment that a panel, the Baidyanathan Commission, had to be set up for a probe. His government did not live long enough to read the findings, though. Until then, Morarji was seen as an upright man. 

 In those years, another famous man, Jagjivan Ram, lost his public standing because of the alleged misdeeds of his son. The lurid pictures of Suresh, 46, in intimate positions with lady love Sushma, 21, shattered him. From 1978, when the scandal broke, to his death eight years later, Jagjivan Rams career hardly recovered.

 P.V. Narasimha Rao got into trouble when son P.V. Prabhakar Rao was arrested in connection with the import of $38 million worth of urea that was to be supplied by a Turkish firm Karsan Incorporates to National Fertilisers. The urea never reached Indian shores. The 1995 scam dogged Narasimha Rao in his last years as Prime Minister.

 Amit gave dad Ajit Jogi more than his share of problems. Amit was acquitted in a Raipur murder case, but not before being dubbed Chhattisgarhs Sanjay Gandhi.

 Venod Sharma, a former Union minister, lost his job as Haryana Congress chief when son Manu was arrested in the Jessica Lal murder case. Another Congress leader, Amarinder Singh, is fighting a grim battle to save his son Raninder from his hawala troubles.

 In the bleak picture, it is Amrit who stands out as the bright spot. 

 Manmohan Singhs daughter has built a formidable reputation as a critic of the Bush administration in her role of an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. Her stand may come at an awkward time for her father but nobody is complaining.

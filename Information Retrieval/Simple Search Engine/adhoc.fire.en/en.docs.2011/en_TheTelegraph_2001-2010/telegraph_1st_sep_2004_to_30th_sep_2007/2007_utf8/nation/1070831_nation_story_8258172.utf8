 Luckier dozens who got away

 Jodhpur, Aug. 30: Salman Khan may have been nailed in two cases but the record of Jodhpur wildlife authorities against poachers has been poor.

 Of the 640 poaching cases they have registered in the past 18 years, only 90 have reached the courts and 28 yielded convictions. The figures suggest that just one out of every 20 to 25 poachers ends up behind bars.

 Salmans two convictions, for killing a chinkara and a black buck, are not on this list of 28 since both those cases were filed by police and not the wildlife department, which registers its own cases.

 The police had registered FIRs against Salman under pressure from the Bishnois, a local community of wildlife worshippers. The wildlife departments lone case against the actor is yet to reach the courts.

 B.R. Bhadoo, district forest officer, cited manpower shortage as the reason it had been so difficult to travel the 200 yards from the wildlife office to the Jodhpur court. A lot of time needs to be spent in investigation to get a case to court, he said.

 With prosecution so difficult, 390 of the 640 cases have been settled at the department level with fines, said officials who described these cases as minor.

 The wildlife office registered 62 cases in 2000-01, but only 15 made it to the courts. The figures for 1998-99, the year of Salmans alleged rampage through the districts forests, are 53 and nine.

 The officials said most of their time and energy was spent patrolling the forests to try and prevent poaching. The department reportedly receives two or three tip-offs a day.

 Still, the officials said, they were investigating 121 cases, some dating back to 1991.

 Bhadoo spoke enthusiastically about the state governments recent promise to set up an anti-poaching cell.

 Forest minister Laxmi Narayan Dave suggested this on August 13. If this comes through, there will be staff who will exclusively pursue things in court, Bhadoo said.

 Wednesday brought cheer to the Jodhpur wildlife office when it was donated a vehicle by the Bishnoi Tiger Force, an NGO active against felling and poaching.

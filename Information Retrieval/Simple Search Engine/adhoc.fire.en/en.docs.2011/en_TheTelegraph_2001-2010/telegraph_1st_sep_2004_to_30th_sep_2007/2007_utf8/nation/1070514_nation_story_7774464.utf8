 June dates for DU admission

 New Delhi, May 13 (PTI): Admission forms for undergraduate courses in Delhi University will be available between June 1 and 15.

 Students can also submit the forms during this period and get themselves registered for the admission process.

 University registrar A.K. Dube said: The forms will be available in 16 different centres across the capital, including one on the main campus. The admission will be conducted in the same fashion and for the same number of seats as last year as the OBC quota issue is sub judice. 

 There are about 43,000 seats in about 80 colleges under Delhi University.

 The human resource development ministry has asked the university to go ahead with the admissions in accordance with last years norms.

 Dube, however, added that the varsity has asked the colleges to make an assessment of their requirements for implementing the OBC quota.

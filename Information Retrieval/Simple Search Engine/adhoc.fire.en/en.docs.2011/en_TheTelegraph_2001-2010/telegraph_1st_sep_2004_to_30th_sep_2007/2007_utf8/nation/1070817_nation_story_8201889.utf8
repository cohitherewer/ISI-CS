 Chandigarh, Aug. 16: Five-year-old Sagar was run over by a car on Tuesday as he was returning home from school unescorted.

 Today, parents and relatives of students threw stones and damaged property at Gurgaons Colonel Public School, demanding the arrest of owner Kanwar Singh Bhardwaj and his wife Shiksha, whom they blamed for the childs death.

 The school unexpectedly gave over at 11am on Tuesday, instead of the usual 1.30pm, and students were told to go home on their own, the protesters alleged. 

 We have detained both and are questioning them on the reasons for the early closure and allowing the students to leave without escorts, Sector 10 station house officer Radheyshyam said over the phone.

 Police said Sagars parents complained that they were not informed that school would give over early on Tuesday. We are probing whether the school authorities can be hauled up for gross negligence as the parents were not informed of the early closure, Radheyshyam said.

 Sagar, one of five children from the same family studying in the school and who were making their way back together, was knocked down by a car near a state highway. He died on the spot.

 A police officer said the nursery students family told them the children were forced to vacate the school immediately and not wait for parents or relatives to fetch them.

 We are looking into the matter seriously and will take appropriate action. The students should not have been allowed to leave on their own, DCP (west) Mehraj Singh said.

 Gurgaon police are also looking into allegations that some children were beaten up by the school guard and a physical education trainer when they refused to leave unaccompanied.

 Boy killed

 A Class III student of Kendriya Vidyalaya was killed in Jaipur on Wednesday when the school gate collapsed. Sachin and several other students, who had come for the Independence Day programme, were swinging on the gate when it gave way. The boy died in hospital, the police said.

 Principal P.S. Ahluwalia condoled Sachins death but said the school could not be held responsible. Sachins parents, however, alleged the school had not repaired the gate despite repeated reminders.

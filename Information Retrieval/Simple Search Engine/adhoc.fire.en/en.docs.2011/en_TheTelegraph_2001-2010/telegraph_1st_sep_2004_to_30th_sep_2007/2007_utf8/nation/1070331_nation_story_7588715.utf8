 Sharad lobs bias slur at SC

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 30: As political parties stepped up pressure on the government to find ways to get around the Supreme Court stay on reservation for OBCs in higher education, the Janata Dal (United) today accused the apex court of harbouring upper-caste bias.

 How can we expect the judiciary to give a judgm- ent favourable to the policy of reservation when it has yet to implement (it) in its own establishment? asked party president Sharad Yadav.

 The JD (U) chief asked why judges, despite taking an oath to protect the Con- stitution, had not been able to implement the constitut-ional provisions of reservation for Scheduled Castes and Tribes and Other Back-ward Classes in the higher judiciary.

 It is high time that Par- liament takes proper steps so that the reservation policy is implemented in all high courts and the Supreme Court of India, Sharad Yadav said.

 Calling the reasons behind the apex court verdict un- fortunate, unconstitutional and absurd, he said: This order has not only demolish-ed the Constitution by denying the constitutional rights of OBCs, but has also degraded the Indian judiciary in the eyes of 85 per cent of Indian people.

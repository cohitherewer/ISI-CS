 Driver suicide in Sanu bungalow

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 2: Kumar Sanus driver allegedly committed suicide at the playback singers bungalow in Versova in the western suburbs of Mumbai, police said today.

 One of Sanus trusted employees, 33-year-old Sajid Mohammed Khan hanged himself from a ceiling fan in Sargam, the singers unoccupied bungalow in Versova, the police said. Khan was last seen last night.

 Sanus gardener alerted the police this morning when Khan did not respond to his calls to wake up.

 Initially, it was believed that financial problems could have been one of the reasons for Khans suicide, but Khans family as well as Sanu denied it.

 Sajid was employed with me for the last six years and had been taking care of the bungalow for the last seven months. He would also take care of my dog, Sanu said. 

 The singer said Khan could not possibly have any financial constraints since he was well-paid and also received extra money when he drove Sanu for recordings.

 I last met him the day before and gave him Rs 3,000 to celebrate Id. That day, some of his friends had come over to the bungalow and he was singing with them. I suspect it could be a personal problem that bothered him.

 Versova police said they had concluded that Khan committed suicide but would investigate the reasons. 

 Khans family, consisting of his wife and two children, lives in Andheri. His relatives said he used to drink regularly but gave it up a fortnight ago. He had also turned more religious and started offering prayers five times a day since he kicked the habit. 

 The family said Khan had been restless during the last few days.

 Bhutan treaty in new bottle

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: Very slowly, India is dismantling some of its inheritance from the British Raj years, and what better way to start than with its most reliable ally, Bhutan.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the newly-anointed king of Bhutan, Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuk, today signed a new friendship treaty that updates and significantly democratises a 58-year-old document.

 The new treaty abandons most of the imperious language that reflected the Centres dealings with its neighbours. In its stead is a more egalitarian spirit, which nevertheless bluntly states that Bhutan will do nothing on its soil that will be adverse to India.

 Article 2 of the 1949 treaty, for example, demanded that Bhutan be guided by the advice of the Government of India in regard to its external relations. Todays updated version replaces that with friendly cooperation.

 Similarly, Article 6, which dealt with Bhutans complete reliance on India vis--vis the buying of arms equipment, will now be amended so that all non-lethal military equipment can be purchased independently by Thimphu, with no reference from New Delhi.

 However, the import of arms and ammunition, machines, warlike material and stores for Bhutans welfare and strength still requires Indias assistance and approval.

 The updated treaty reiterates that there shall be perpetual peace and friendship between India and Bhutan, the spokesperson said today, adding, that it does not allow the use of their territories for activities harmful to the national security and interest of the other.

 The Indo-Bhutan treaty, official sources said, will soon be followed by a similar signature between India and the new Republican government of Nepal.

 Bhutans centrality in the Indian mind is a function of the very close relationship between the Bhutanese monarchs and New Delhi, when after Indias independence Thimphu allowed its defence, security and foreign policy to be largely governed by India.

 After the signing ceremony, the new king said in a statement that geopolitical realities (and) the deep foundations of our existing bonds guarantee that India and Bhutan will always share common interests. From a guiding role upon Bhutans first step to modernisation, we now stand as close friends and equal partners in the global arena.

 The new kings father, Jigme Singye Wangchuk, can be credited with dignifying this very sensitive relationship for the last 40-odd years.

 So much so that when Ulfa militants took refuge in the Bhutanese forests in 2004, the erstwhile king ordered that their camps be thrown out of his territory.

 In return for the hundred per cent loyalty, especially in the international arena when it felt somewhat isolated, a grateful New Delhi has over the years spent large sums of money on development projects like roads and hydro-electric plants. In the latter case, Thimphu sold the electricity back to India, in what amounted to a win-win situation.

 Three weeks ago, New Delhi announced that the friendship treaty with Bhutan was being overhauled, keeping the changing world in mind.

 And although Thimphu today has much more freedom to leverage its own power, separately from India, the deep friendship was manifest some six weeks ago when the then crown prince, Jigme Khesar, came to Delhi on a quiet trip for talks with external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee.

 Mukherjee was clearly bowled over by the young man. So was everyone else, official and civilian, who met him. On a more practical level, India continued to keep quiet over the fate of the 100,000-odd Bhutanese people who have more or less been evicted by Bhutan, ostensibly because they are of Nepali origin and dont speak the Bhutanese language as well.

 So when Khesar arrived in the capital yesterday for a six-day visit, the smiles on the faces of hard-bitten officials were astonishingly genuine.

 Vote-base jitters for Lalu amp; other allies

 Lalu Prasad: Minority factor

 New Delhi, Aug. 19: A sense of unease has started gripping a section of the UPA allies though they have formally rallied around the Congress on the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 One party that is particularly worried is Lalu Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal, which fears a loss of face among Muslims, who together with the Yadavs constitute the core vote base of the party and who are considered by and large anti-American.

 The more we are seen as moving closer to the US, the more will we distance ourselves from the Muslims, a senior RJD leader said on condition of anonymity.

 As the RJD is part of the UPA government, no one in the party is ready to speak out openly against the nuclear deal, which has been cleared by the Union cabinet. But the RJD leaders are watching with anxiety the rapid escalation of the crisis.

 In the event of the Left actually forcing a mid-term poll, anti-Americanism will occupy a prominent place in the campaigning. We will then find it extremely difficult to clear our position among the Muslim voters, the RJD leader said.

 Party leaders also express anger though privately at the way the Congress has handled the issue. 

 The Congress should have taken other UPA allies in confidence in the beginning itself and not when the matter went out of its control. It is not a minor issue, the RJD leader said. 

 This pro-American and anti-American debate triggered by the Indo-US nuclear deal is going to have serious political implications for all of us. The debate will assume magnified proportions if the Left actually withdraws support from the UPA government, he added.

 Although the fear of annoying Muslim voters haunts some other UPA allies as well, the RJDs predicament appears to be the worst.

 During the last parliamentary elections in April-May 2004, the party had succeeded in keeping its M-Y (Muslim-Yadav) combination intact, which helped it bag 24 out of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar. 

 Since then, the RJD has had a substantial erosion in its M-Y base, which was reflected in two rounds of Assembly polls in October 2004 and February 2005 when the party was thrown out of power in the state.

 According to RJD analysts, one of the factors for the partys Assembly debacle was the weakening of its hold over Dalit and backward Muslims. The party desperately needs to win back its lost base, especially the minorities. 

 The nuclear deal-induced crisis, however, threatens to achieve the opposite.

 Cong loads loot gun to knock Mulayam 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mulayam, Sibal

 New Delhi, April 17: The Congress today launched Loot of Uttar Pradesh, a series of exposes against Mulayam Singh Yadav, to spice up the campaign for the remaining four phases of polls.

 Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal named 28 senior bureaucrats, police officers, friends and relatives of Mulayam who were allotted plots in Gomti Nagar, a prime location in Lucknow, without proper bids or draw of lots.

 Plots were allotted to:

 Anita Singh, special secretary to Mulayam

 The daughter of principal secretary to Mulayam

 R.C.S. Rawat, father-in-law of Akhilesh Singh, Mulayams son

 C.P. Sharma, chief town planner, Lucknow

 S. Rastogi, neighbour of C.P. Sharma

 Navneet Sikera, former SSP, Lucknow

 Kailash Devi, wife of R.V.P. Yadav, special secretary, housing, Lucknow

 Shiv Singh Yadav, director (finance), Uttar Pradesh government

 Similarly, there are other individuals either related to Mulayam or connected with senior bureaucrats and ministers of the state, Sibal said. Besides such connections, there are glaring irregularities in the allotments, he alleged.

 In the case of Saroj Chowdhary, wife of former revenue minister Ambika Chowdhary, the date of application for the Gomti Nagar plot is May 7, 2005, while the land had been allotted the previous day. 

 Sibal said the matter was brought before the Supreme Court through a special leave petition. Despite the petition, no action has so far been taken.

 Nod hope for 82 SEZs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, April 2: The freeze on the 80-odd special economic zones (SEZ) with no land acquisition problems may be lifted with the empowered group of ministers expected to clear the proposals at its meeting next week. 

 One of the first decisions for the ministers will be on the 82 plans where formalities have been completed and a notification is all that is needed, a senior official said.

 The meeting follows a clearance last week from the Congress to decide the future of SEZs, which had come under a cloud following the violence in Nandigram and protests in other states. The issue was also discussed at Sundays meeting between Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 

 The Congresss clearance came after mounting pressure from the commerce ministry and from UPA partners, including the DMK in Tamil Nadu. Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Haryana, all Congress-ruled states, who want to move ahead with SEZ plans. 

 Of the 234 SEZ proposals that have received a clearance, only 63 have been notified. Of the remaining, 82 have applied for notification after completing formalities. The relief is limited to those SEZs that have land. The fate of others will be decided after the Centre comes up with a comprehensive relief and rehabilitation policy.

 Approvals were frozen after the group of ministers last meeting in January. The decision was prompted by Assembly elections in Punjab and Uttarakhand in February. 

 The commerce ministry said the delay in approvals was worrying investors, many of whom had started having second thoughts. The Prime Minister admitted last month that SEZs had run into rough weather, but insisted the policy to set up the exclusive zones would stay. 

 The rehabilitation package for farmers displaced by SEZs is being drawn up by the ministry for rural development. Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, the minister in charge, will soon approach the cabinet with his draft. The package aims to give farmers a better deal, limit the size of SEZs and ensure fertile land isnt acquired.

 CM farm fee request 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 21: Amid the controversy over the Reliance retail project, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has sought information on the market fees levied by the state marketing board on farm produce traded at the 46 state-run regulated markets.

 Both the board and the state agricultural department are now controlled by CPM ally Forward Bloc, which is opposed to the entry of Indian corporate groups in the domestic retail market.

 Bloc sources said information on market levies and farm products marketing infrastructure has already been sent to the chief minister. He also been told about the boards plans to develop a three-tier farm products marketing network revamping the existing one, and have asked for land for a Rs 500-crore project.

 The Bloc has decided to hold bilateral talks with the CPM and other major Left Front partners on the Reliance controversy.

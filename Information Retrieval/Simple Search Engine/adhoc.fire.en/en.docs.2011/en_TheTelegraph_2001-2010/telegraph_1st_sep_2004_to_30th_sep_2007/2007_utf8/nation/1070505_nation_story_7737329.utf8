 Bofors bitten, Delhi shy

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 New Delhi, May 4: Sweden hopes an upgraded defence relationship will be the linchpin of its India ties, but the Congress-led Centre remains wary about sourcing anything from the country that sold it the Bofors gun 20 years ago.

 Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt, in town for a rediscovery of India, met defence minister A.K. Antony yesterday and followed it up with meetings today with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee.

 Sweden is one of four countries shortlisted by India for the purchase of 126 fighter aircraft. The others in the running for the $7-billion deal are the US, Russia and France.

 This morning, Bildt said he had told Antony that offers to sell both the Bofors Howitzer gun and the Gripen multi-role combat aircraft were on the table. Swedish ambassador Lars-Olof Lindgren was said to have suggested that Stockholm hoped an upgraded defence relationship would be the centrepiece of bilateral ties.

 Although the army seems delighted with the performance of the Bofors Howitzer and Stockholm has promised not to have any third-party conditions, the Congress-led establishment is still nervous about another defence deal with Sweden.

 The Bofors may be a very good gun, but it has six times the problems any other gun has, a senior government source said.

 Such sentiments may not be enough to discourage Bildt, clearly a man of many parts and perhaps the only leader in the world to have his own blog (its the most popular blog in all Sweden, he said). 

 He seemed to want to reinvent the bilateral relationship by supporting the Indo-US nuclear deal that would give New Delhi a much greater profile worldwide.

 We have concerns about what the deal may do to the non-proliferation regime, Bildt said, adding, however, that Sweden understood well Indias need to have energy to support its economic growth.

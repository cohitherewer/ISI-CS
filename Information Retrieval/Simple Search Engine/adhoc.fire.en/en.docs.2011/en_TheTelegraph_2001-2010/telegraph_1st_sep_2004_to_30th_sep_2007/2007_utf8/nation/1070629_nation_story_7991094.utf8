 Militant tag on state

 Ramesh: Tea blame

 Bharnobari Tea Estate (Alipurduar), June 28: Jairam Ramesh thinks Bengals violent and militant political culture has come in the way of reopening the closed tea gardens of the Dooars.

 The Union minister of state for commerce and industry has blamed the squabbling trade unions for the stalemate. 

 The minister had said yesterday that during his three-day tour of the Dooars, he was optimistic about reopening at least two of the 14 closed estates. Today, it was evident that none would reopen.

 It is because of the differences among trade unions. The political culture in Bengal is too militant and violent. The unions should unite and not squabble over petty issues, said Ramesh while addressing a crowd in front of the Intuc office in Hasimara. He later set off for Bharnobari Tea Estate, 1km away. He had come from Chalsa this morning.

 Congress leaders of Jalpaiguri district, however, feel that Rameshs appeals for unity to unions are preposterous. I have explained to the minister that such a thing is not possible here. The idea is preposterous. As a central minister, he should realise the ground realities, said Biswaranjan Sarkar, the president of the Congresss Jalpaiguri unit.

 At Bharnobari, the disappointment of the workers was palpable. The garden has been closed for almost two years and Ramesh had promised to bring the new owner with him today. 

 But nothing of that sort happened. Instead, we have been told to wait for a few more weeks. Last evening, too, the minister had said the garden would open, but we dont know what happened in a night, said Lalita Toppo, a worker of Bharnobari. 

 Yesterday, on his way to Chalsa from Bagdogra airport, the minister had said he was confident that Bharnobari and Redbank would reopen during his stay.

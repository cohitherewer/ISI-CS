 Coercion heat on ICICI bank

 New Delhi, Feb. 21 (PTI): ICICI Bank, under judicial scanner for allegedly using goonda elements to recover loans, today assured the Supreme Court that it was willing to settle a repayment dispute with a 75-year-old widow who had accused the bank of using coercive methods.

 The bank, which hired two high-profile lawyers, Harish Salve and Mukul Rohtagi, to defend itself, gave the assurance before a bench of Justices A.R. Lakshmanan and Altamas Kabir.

 During the arguments that preceded the assurance, the counsel for Prakash Kaur, the complainant, submitted that she had defaulted in paying only about Rs 28,000 in repayment and not over Rs 2 lakh as claimed by the bank.

 The counsel accused the bank of making wrong entries by crediting the cheques issued by Kaur towards the repayment into the account of one Prakash Dubey and then blaming the widow for not repaying the loan.

 Salve claimed there were typographical errors in the notices served on Kaur for having defaulted in the repayment.

 New Delhi, June 9: Former Test cricketer Maninder Singh was driven to hospital early this morning, unconscious and both wrists slashed, with his wife insisting it was a bizarre accident involving glass windowpanes.

 Police wouldnt say if they suspected a suicide attempt by the 41-year-old, arrested last month for cocaine possession but now on bail, but Maninders wife Melly flared up at reporters questions. We never said it was an attempt to suicide. You people are only spreading it, she said.

 According to Melly, her husband had returned home late on Friday night from a party. We were all sleeping and didnt hear when he rang the bell. Irritated, he went to the back (of the house) and banged on the bay window. He slipped and cut his wrists on the windowpane.

 A leading coach and close associate of Maninder, however, told The Telegraph the former left-arm spinner was going through deep depression.

 He had too many family problems. His wife often stays away from the family. She returned from Pune only a few days ago.

 Shanti Mukund hospital authorities said Maninder was bleeding profusely and needed seven hours of surgery by orthopaedists and plastic surgeons before he could be declared out of danger at 10 am. 

 We have spoken neither to the doctors nor Maninder yet, deputy commissioner of police Ajay Chaudhary said. We shall be able to reach any conclusion only after knowing the nature of his injury. He is not in a position to make a statement.

 Maninder, who now occasionally commentates on television, had been caught receiving 1.5 grams of cocaine from friend Saim Siddiqui, a club cricket coach. 

 The police claimed he had turned to drugs because of a rough patch in his family life, but Maninder said he had merely wanted to unwind after a draining World Cup commentary assignment.

 Maninder had extensive injuries in both wrists. In the right wrist, all the tendons, arteries and nerves were cut. There was no blood circulation or sensation in the fingers of the right hand. In the left wrist, there were only tendon injuries, hospital medical superintendent G.S. Mathur said.

 He was taken to the ICU. His blood pressure was not recordable and he was in a state of shock. 

 Mathur wouldnt say if the ex-cricketer was drunk: Its a very difficult question. After all, its a medico-legal case.

 The police have taken blood samples to test for alcohol and drugs.

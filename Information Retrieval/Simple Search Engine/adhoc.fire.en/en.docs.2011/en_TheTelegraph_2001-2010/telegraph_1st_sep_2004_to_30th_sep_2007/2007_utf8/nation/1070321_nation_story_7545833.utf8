 Govt steps up J amp;K firefight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 20: The Centre has stepped up efforts to save the government in Jammu and Kashmir.

 The Prime Ministers Office took the initiative today, consulting officials and Congress leaders to find a compromise acceptable to Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.

 Mufti, whose party is an ally of the Congress in Kashmir, is scheduled to meet the Prime Minister on Wednesday. Today Mufti said the meeting would be fruitful only if the Congress was willing to move forward on his demands.

 The PDP wants troop reduction in the Valley, repeal of the armed forces special powers act and vacation of civilian properties used by security forces. 

 On Monday, there was little sign that the deadlock would be broken. Chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said after a meeting with the Prime Minister that the time for such troop cuts had not come.

 Sources say the Prime Minister does not appear opposed to demilitarisation but is facing resistance from within the government. 

 The PDPs political affairs committee is meeting on March 25 to decide if it should continue supporting the Congress regime.

 For the Congress, there are not too many options left now. Yesterday, its hopes of running a government with the National Conference were dashed when party chief Omar Abdullah said he would prefer elections. 

 Sources said the PMO has consulted officials on the Kashmir desk in the home ministry. State Congress leaders, opposed to troop reduction, were also approached. But sources say Congress chief Sonia Gandhi wanted the alliance to continue.

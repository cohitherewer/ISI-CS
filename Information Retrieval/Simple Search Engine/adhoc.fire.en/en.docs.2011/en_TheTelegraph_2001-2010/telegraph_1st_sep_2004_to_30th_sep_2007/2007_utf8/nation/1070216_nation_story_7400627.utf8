The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 DD to get live feed for last match

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: After making do with delayed telecasts so far, Doordarshan viewers will get to see at least the last match of the India-Sri Lanka series live.

 This is the outcome of a temporary patch-up between Nimbus Communications and Prasar Bharati, brokered during todays hearing in Delhi High Court.

 The condition of the truce reached in the court of Justice Vikramjit Sen and Justice J.P. Singh is that Nimbus would provide the live feed to DD for the Visakhapatnam one-dayer on February 17. 

 In return, the information and broadcasting ministry would go slow on the showcause notice it had sent to the company. The case will, however, go on.

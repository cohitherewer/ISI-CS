 Taj opens, heads roll

 Lucknow, Aug. 30: The gates of Taj Mahal were thrown open to visitors today as the curfew clamped after yesterdays accident-sparked arson was partially lifted.

 Tourists, many foreigners forced indoors by the mob fury, returned to the worlds most famous monument to love after the curbs on movement in the Tajganj area, where the 17th-century structure is located, were relaxed.

 Agra has been limping back to normal since this morning. The district administration has, therefore, relaxed the curfew in the Taj area from 6am to 6pm, Manju Chandra, special secretary, home, said.

 The curbs at night in the Taj area will continue for a few more days, Chandra said, adding that the authorities had been asked to watch out for troublemakers. Thirty arrests have been made in connection with the mayhem.

 The violence erupted after a truck ran over four persons returning from Shab-e-Barat prayers and sped away. One man died and 50 were injured in the protests that followed.

 Archaeological Survey of India assistant superintendent S.K. Sharma said the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which is in charge of security at the Taj, has been asked to intensify visitor checks.

 The fear of fresh trouble was still on the minds of visitors, though. A state tourism department official in Agra said the crowds at the Taj today were unusually small.

 Additional-director general of police (law and order) Brij Lal said in Agra that curfew will remain in force in Mantola, Nai Ki Mandi, Loha Mandi and Rakabganj, areas hit by the violence yesterday.

 Amid the heightened security drill, the action against officials who failed to avert the flare-up began today. Additional superintendent of police (city) Rahul Yadavendu was transferred to the office of the director-general of police in Lucknow seen as a punishment posting. 

 Another 12 officials, mostly from the traffic beat, have been suspended. They are being blamed for having allowed vehicles in the wee hours of Wednesday, before the people returning after prayers had dispersed from the roads.

 Fearing more trouble, the police stopped senior BJP leader Vinay Katiyar in Mathura when he was on his way to Agra.

 An upset Katiyar said the administration was trying to hide some facts by keeping him out of the trouble zone.

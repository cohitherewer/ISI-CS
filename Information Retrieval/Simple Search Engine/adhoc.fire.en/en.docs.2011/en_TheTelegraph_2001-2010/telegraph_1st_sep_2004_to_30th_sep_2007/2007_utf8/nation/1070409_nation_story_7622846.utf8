 Cong steps up CD heat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 8: The BJP, already facing the music in the CD case, appears headed for more trouble with the Congress planning to approach the Election Commission tomorrow seeking the partys de-recognition.

 The poll panel had earlier asked for FIRs to be filed against state and central BJP leaders including party chief Rajnath Singh for violating the code of conduct by producing and distributing the CD in Uttar Pradesh on the eve of Assembly polls.

 We, however, feel the matter is more serious. The BJP has violated the constitutional declarations on the basis of which an organisation is recognised as a political party in India, Congress leader Kapil Sibal said.

 Senior Congress leaders will also hand over another CD allegedly containing objectionable matter against Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayavati and former Iraq president Saddam Hussein.

 Singur spat over judge comment

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 30: A remark by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar on the payment schedule for the land acquired in Singur triggered a crossfire in the high court today.

 Early this week, the Tatas had submitted a 99-year lease rent payment scheme before the court, which is hearing 10 petitions challenging the legality of the land acquisition for the small-car project and the process of giving compensation.

 Advocate Arunava Ghosh, appearing for the petitioners, argued that the land deal between the government and the Tatas would result in a loss for the former. 

 The chief justice responded: The payment schedule is not duly endorsed by any chartered firm or any similar authorised organisation. So the court is not relying on it. 

 Ghosh dubbed the comment significant and said it validated the protest against the land acquisition. 

 My client, Biplab Halim, a social activist, alleged that the state government would incur a huge loss by handing over the Singur land to the Tatas. So the courts comment today means a validation of our stand, Ghosh claimed.

 The state lawyers sprang to their feet and rubbished Ghoshs argument.

 They said the issue of payment schedule does not fall under the courts jurisdiction and is not relevant to the case. They argued that if the court wanted to intervene, it would have to ask the Tatas to submit authorised documents.

 The hearing of the case ended today and the bench adjourned the verdict. The same bench had earlier heard the Nandigram firing case, whose verdict, too, is pending.

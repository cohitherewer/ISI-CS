 Civil rights leader held

 Raipur, May 24 (PTI): Police today took into custody the state president of the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties, Rajendra Sail, in the second arrest of a civil rights leader in 10 days.

 Sail was arrested here in connection with a contempt case in which he had been sentenced to a jail term, Raipur superintendent of police Lal Umed Singh said. 

 PUCL general secretary Vinayak Sen was arrested on May 14 for his alleged links with Naxalites. 

 Sail was convicted by the Supreme Court on April 21, 2005, Singh said. It was a case of wilful contempt of Madhya Pradesh High Court for which he had been sentenced to one weeks imprisonment.

 Chhattisgarh police, he said, yesterday got the order from Madhya Pradesh to arrest him.

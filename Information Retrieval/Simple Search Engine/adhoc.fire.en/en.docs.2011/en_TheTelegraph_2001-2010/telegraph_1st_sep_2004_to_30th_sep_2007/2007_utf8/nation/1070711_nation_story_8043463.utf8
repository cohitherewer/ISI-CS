 Tussle over Shekhar appeal

 - Nephew questions support to Shekhawat in party tug-of-war 

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 Chandra Shekhar

 New Delhi, July 10: The battle for Chandra Shekhars socialist legacy is under way with nephew Praveen Singh questioning the facts of a press release issued in the former Prime Ministers name that whole-heartedly and without any reservation endorsed Bhairon Singh Shekhawat as presidential candidate.

 Days before Chandra Shekhar passed away, his Samajwadi Janata Party was thrown into turmoil when Praveen, the party national secretary, wrote a letter to general secretary Ayub Khan saying he was distressed to learn that such an appeal was issued on June 15 in favour of Shekhawat.

 In his letter written in Hindi, Praveen said Chandra Shekhars condition had already become serious by June 10 and had deteriorated so badly by June 14 that he was in no condition to talk to anyone.

 Kisi appeal ko likhvaane ya us par hastakshar karne ki baat to door ki hai, (The question of getting an appeal written or signing it was a far cry), wrote Singh. ...For the presidential election, if some people are misusing Chandra Shekhars name to support their own people then this is very unfortunate

 When contacted, however, Praveen would not say who he was referring to and simply repeated himself. I have no idea how Chandra Shekharji could sign on a piece of paper when he was already in a semi-coma by June 15.

 According to a June 15 press release issued on Chandra Shekhars letterhead, the former Prime Minister extols Shekhawats virtues: I wholeheartedly and without any reservation endorse/propose the election of Shri Bhairon Singh Shekhawat as our next President He combines a lifetimes experience of dedicated public service with rare qualities of head and heart.

 Clearly, the death of the former PM has already unleashed a struggle within his party.

 There is Praveen, who contested from Ballia Chandra Shekhars Lok Sabha seat in the recent Uttar Pradesh elections and lost, and it is now said that his eldest son Pankaj could stake claim to his fathers constituency.

 Party old-timers like Kamal Morarka and Ravindra Manchanda also stress the closeness of their ties to Chandra Shekhar.

 Manchanda told The Telegraph that Chandra Shekhar had himself signed the press release, that, in fact he, Morarka, and Shekhawat were all present when Chandra Shekhar had done so.

 He said Chandra Shekhar signed the letter sometime in May, before he went into the ICU and when he was fully conscious, but that he, Manchanda, issued it only on June 15. He said Chandra Shekhar encouraged Shekhawat to announce his candidature.

 What Praveen Singh is saying is baseless, said Manchanda.

 According to Morarka, the party had received no communication from Praveen. An agitated Morarka said that in his capacity as the chief general secretary of the party, he stood by the contents of the press release that Chandra Shekhar had signed.

 But Khan, to whom Praveen has issued the letter, admitted there was scope for confusion on the matter.

 Everyone knows, said Khan, that around the time the press release was issued, Chandra Shekharji was not in a condition to speak or write. However, everyone also knows that he and Bhairon Singhji had very good relations between them. So there is some confusion on this score.

 It could have been a computer signature, said Khan, adding: I cannot say anything about the authenticity of the letter. It was not issued from the office.

 Khan pointed out that Chandra Shekhar had all kinds of very close political friends like Shekhawat and Atal Bihari Vajpayee (he called him Guruji). But everyone who knew Chandra Shekhar also knew that he always kept personal relations on one side and principles on the other, Khan said.

 Just like the time when Jai Prakash Narayan died, Khan said, there was talk about who would inherit his mantle, whether Jagjivan Ram or Chandra Shekhar. He pleaded that this matter now be laid to rest.

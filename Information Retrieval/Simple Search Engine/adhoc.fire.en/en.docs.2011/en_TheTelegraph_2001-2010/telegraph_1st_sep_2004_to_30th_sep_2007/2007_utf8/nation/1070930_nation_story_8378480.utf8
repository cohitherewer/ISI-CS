 BSP leader in Taj row

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Sept. 29: A BSP legislator has been accused of violating guidelines of the Archaeological Survey of India by extending his house that is situated within 500m of Taj Mahal.

 MLA Zulfiqar Ahmad Bhutto allegedly carried out the renovation and extension work even after the ASI served a notice on him. No case has been registered. The Agra Development Authority had also warned him.

 The Supreme Court has said no construction, horizontal or vertical, could be carried out within 500m of the Taj.

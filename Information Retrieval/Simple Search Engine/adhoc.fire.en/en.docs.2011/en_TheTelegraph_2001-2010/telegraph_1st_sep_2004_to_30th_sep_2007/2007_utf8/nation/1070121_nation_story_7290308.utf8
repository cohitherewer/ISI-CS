 Dahod, Jan. 20: In a year of crucial state elections, every party wants to bask in Gandhis glow. But theres no way Sonia Gandhi was letting Narendra Modi run away with a piece of the Mahatma today.

 The Gujarat chief minister has been garlanding statues of the Father of the Nation wherever he goes.

 After doing it at the Vibrant Gujarat investors meet in Ahmedabad last week, Modi followed the routine at tribal hub Kevadia yesterday and then dragged the great man into his speech.

 If one Mohandas Gandhi was enough to drive away the British, we (fellow Gujaratis) too can accomplish great tasks, he declared.

 But if the BJPs Iron Man II was hoping to milk Gandhis name for his favourite game firing up Gujarat asmita (pride) he was up against Sonia today.

 Without naming Modi, the Congress president said its the biggest insult to Mahatma Gandhi when the communal forces that killed him mouth eulogies to him.

 Sonia has already launched a bid at merging the mystique of the Nehru-Gandhis with the Mahatmas mantle, lining up a glittering satyagraha centenary conference in Delhi this month.

 The guests range from Nobel laureate Mohammed Younus and South African leader Desmond Tutu to the Frontier Gandhis grandson, Asfandyar Wali Khan, and Polands Lech Walesa, not to speak of an army of Presidents and Prime Ministers.

 The tug-of-war over the Mahatma was evident at the recent release of a book on him by his grandson Rajmohan Gandhi at Gandhi Smriti in Delhi. Sonia turned up, but so did the BJPs L.K. Advani.

 The Congress president today scoffed at the saffron parivars grab at Gandhi.

 They cannot be trusted because we know Gandhiji for them is just a mukhota (mask), she told the largest ever tribal rally in the tribal heartland of Dahod.

 Those who spread hatred, we cannot accept them as nationalist. They are just wearing the mukhota. They are not nationalist but kursiwadi (power-hungry), Sonia said.

 With the Assembly polls to be held in the second half of the year, the Congress is trying hard to woo the tribals back into its fold. The size of todays crowd, mainly made up by tribals from 12 eastern Gujarat districts, would have gladdened the party.

 Sonia asked party workers to hawk the Centres welfare schemes among the tribals and monitor whether the benefits were reaching the target populations. She lauded the recent tribal land rights bill as a revolutionary, historic step.

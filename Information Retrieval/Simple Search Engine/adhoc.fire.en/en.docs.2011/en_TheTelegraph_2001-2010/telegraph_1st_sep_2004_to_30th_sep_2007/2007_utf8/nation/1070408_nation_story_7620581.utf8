 Threat twist to CD row

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, April 7: The CD case that caught the BJP on the wrong foot just two days before the Uttar Pradesh polls kicked off has thrown up a new twist. The director of the company that produced the film UP Victimised today said he had received threat calls.

 Jimmedari lo nahin to jaan jayegi (Accept responsibility for its production or you will die), the callers apparently told Virendra Singh. The callers threatened me for going to the media and asked me to take the responsibility for the CD and not link it with the BJP. 

 Singh, the director of Fakira Films, said he has filed an FIR against unnamed persons in Kotwali police station in Saharanpur. The police confirmed having drawn up the report. 

 The threat calls allegedly did not stop with him. Prabesh Gujjar, a spokesman and dialogue writer for the Bulandshahar-based company, said he, too, had received similar calls. Some of the artists who have also been threatened have stopped reporting to work. 

 The CD with audio-visual campaign material called Bharat ki Pukar has inflammatory material against Muslims. 

 Yesterday, the Election Commission filed an FIR against BJP chief Rajnath Singh and senior leader Lalji Tandon in Lucknow in connection with the CD release.

 I still maintain that the CD was manufactured in close consultation with the BJP leaders, including Alpana Talwar and Navin Talwar, the director insisted. 

 The BJP adopted an aggressive stance today. In Saharanpur, Rajnath dared the poll panel to arrest him. The Election Commission is welcome to take action against me if it so wanted under law, he said.

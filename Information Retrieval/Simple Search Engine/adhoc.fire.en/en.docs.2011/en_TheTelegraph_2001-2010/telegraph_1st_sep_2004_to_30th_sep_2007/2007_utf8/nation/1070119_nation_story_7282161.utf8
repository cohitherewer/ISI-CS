 Aspiring soldiers face mind test

 New Delhi: Defence scientists will introduce subtle changes in psychological tests during officer and soldier recruitment this year to eliminate candidates with negative traits.

 The altered tests have been designed to function as better probes of personality traits of the candidates than existing tests, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) officials said today.

 Soldier suicides and incidents of soldiers turning their guns on their colleagues or seniors in recent years have given rise to concerns over the current recruitment process particularly the existing methods of psychological profiling of candidates during the recruitment process.

 About 400 soldiers have committed suicide in India since 2002, and at least 23 soldiers have been involved in fratricide a soldier killing a colleague or a senior.

 Instead of assessing only intelligence and aptitude, the changed tests will examine emotional traits, stress tolerance, and ego strength, said W. Selvamurthy, chief controller of research and development at the DRDO.

 Among negative traits that we dont want to see is a tendency for impulsive responses, depression or anxiety, Selvamurthy said.

 The elimination of candidates with negative traits is expected to reduce the risk of what the DRDO scientists described as aberrant behaviour.

 The new psychological profiling will be part of a package of changes in the pre-selection screening tests expected to be introduced in defence services beginning this year, according to DRDO scientists.

 The existing selection system is 50 years old and is designed mainly for conventional warfare, said Manas Mandal, director of the Defence Institute of Psychological Research, a DRDO Laboratory.

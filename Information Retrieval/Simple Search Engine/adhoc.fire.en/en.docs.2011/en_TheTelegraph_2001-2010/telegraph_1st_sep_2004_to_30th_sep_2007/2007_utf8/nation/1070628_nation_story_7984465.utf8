 Terror box, wrapped in Calcutta

 OUR CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES

 Ahmedabad, June 27: Terror in a tiffin box, couriered from Calcutta.

 A familiar fear returned to haunt Ahmedabad today after a 23-year-old man from the Bengal capital was arrested with a tiffin bomb at a crowded bus stand, apparently with the order to pass the explosive on to another person.

 Police said they swooped on Rashid Ali alias Ismail Ansari at the Lal Darwaja terminus after a tip-off.

 We recovered a bomb kept inside a steel tiffin from Rashid Ali, said inspector V.D. Gohil of Karanj police station.

 The suspect is from Calcutta and speaks both Hindi and Bengali, the inspector added.

 The officer said the youth was arrested as he waited at the bus terminus, which was teeming with people and cordoned off before the bomb was defused.

 The bomb, which Gohil said appeared to be a crude device, brought back memories of the post-Godhra days when similar crude tiffin bombs had exploded in five Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service buses at different places in the city on May 29, 2002.

 Nine persons were injured in the blasts.

 An anti-terror court later sentenced five persons to 10 years in jail for the explosions.

 More recently, a bomb in a tiffin box ripped through a Friday prayer crowd at a Hyderabad mosque, killing several worshippers. 

 Gohil said Rashid, after being apprehended and questioned on the spot, himself told us there was a bomb inside the tiffin he was carrying.

 The police suspect he brought it as a sample to show it to prospective customers. 

 The real motive behind the youths action can only be known after his detailed interrogation, Gohil said.

 The inspector said several tiffin bombs have been seized from the city in the past. But this is the first time that the police have managed to catch a person red-handed.

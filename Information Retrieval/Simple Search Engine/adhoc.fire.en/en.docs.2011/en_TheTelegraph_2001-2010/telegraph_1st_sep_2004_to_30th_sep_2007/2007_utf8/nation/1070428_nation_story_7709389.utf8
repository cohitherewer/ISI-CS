 Counselling on IIT table

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, April 27: IIT Kanpur is reviewing its counselling system following a suspicion that examination phobia might be the reason behind a students suicide.

 Janugari Bharadwaja, a 21-year-old civil engineering student, had thrown himself before a speeding train on Wednesday night.

 Bharadwajas batchmates said he had not done well in his third-year semester exam in January and was asked to reappear in two of his papers. Fearing another failure, he was reluctant to take the tests, a student said.

 I found him nervous and fearful. He was not preparing for the re-examination. He always asked what if he again did badly in the two papers, the student said.

 Professors said Bharadwaja was an introvert and they had no way of knowing what he was going through. Some students felt that a change in policy, ironically brought about by another suicide, could have contributed to keeping his batchmates and others in the dark.

 A student had killed himself in 2005, unable to cope with the humiliation after his name figured on a list of students who had to take the tests again. Since then, the institute stopped putting up the names, choosing to inform students individually.

 This, some feel, may have been the reason why not too many people were aware of Bharadwajas trauma. Bharadwaja, son of a college lecturer, hailed from Andhra Pradesh.

 This is the fourth suicide on campus since November 2005. 

 The administration has decided to appoint three to four counsellors in each hostel, whose primary responsibility would be to keep vigil on students, IIT Kanpur registrar Sanjeev Kashalkar said. The counselling centres will be set up to help students deal with depression if they perform poorly in exams.

 Kripa Shankar, the institutes deputy director, added: We already have student counsellors who assist the counselling cell by bringing students who are depressed. We may have to strengthen the system by increasing the number of student counsellors.

 One suggestion is to widen the reach of yoga, which is now limited to first-year students.

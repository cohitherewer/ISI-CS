 Blame it on the Ash jinx

 Aishwarya: Manglik menace

 New Delhi, May 12: In true soap opera style, the blame is on the bahu.

 After the crushing defeat in the Assembly polls, tongues have begun wagging in the Samajwadi Party that Aishwarya Rais Manglik shadow may have fallen on its general secretary Amar Singh.

 Amar had accompanied Ash who he described as the bahu of Uttar Pradesh along with Amitabh Bachchan and his family on a tour of temples to free her of the Mars jinx in her horoscope before her marriage to Abhishek.

 Many in Amars party are saying, with a chuckle, all that temple-trotting could not stop the Mangal dosh from taking its toll.

 On a more serious note, murmurs of Amars corrupting influence on party boss Mulayam Singh Yadav are getting louder. Courtesy his lieutenant, Mulayam has been hobnobbing with the rich and famous like Amitabh, Jaya Bachchan and Jaya Prada from Bollywood, and industrialists Anil Ambani and Subroto Roy. This, a senior Samajwadi Party leader said, has hurt Mulayams image as a hardcore socialist.

 Amar, perhaps, is aware of the uncomfortable questions that he might have to face from his party colleagues. 

 What must also be weighing heavily on Amars mind is Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayavatis threat during campaigning that she would launch investigations against both Mulayam and his lieutenant if she came to power.

 It is, therefore, not without reason that the always-ready-with-a-quote Amar has, for once, made himself completely inaccessible.

 So have most of his party members, including the high command. For, visibility leads to accountability a proposition perhaps more horrifying than the election results.

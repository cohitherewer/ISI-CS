New Delhi, Feb. 11: The CBI came down heavily on corruption in the high echelons of power last year, booking close to a thousand gazetted officers in over a hundred government departments.

 The corruption report card for 2006 compiled by the CBI shows more senior officers fell in the trap even as departments like customs and central excise continued to remain symbols of shame.

 Against the common refrain that lower-rung officials are caught while the seniors manage to get away, the agency booked 25 joint secretaries in 1,156 cases registered last year. Out of these, 14 were chargesheeted.

 The customs and central excise department continues to top the list of tainted departments with 68 cases, followed by the department of posts with a tally of 57. The third was the ministry of railways. The department of telecommunication, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, ministry of finance and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi are also in the top 10.

 Officials said the highlights of the cases last year were the senior officers who came under the scanner and the range of departments tainted by the corrupt officials. 

 All the major nationalised banks were also among the tainted organisations.

 Around 200 officers had no escape route as they were caught red-handed while accepting bribes.

 Also, officials pointed out that the agencys own personnel were not above scrutiny. Seven cases were registered against 13 CBI employees, including two deputy legal advisers, an additional superintendent of police and two deputy superintendents of police.

 Fighting corruption is one of the major tasks of the central investigating agency, which faced flak for becoming a tool in the hands of the government of the day for settling political issues. The officials maintained that the fight against corruption was on track.

 But all is not well with the agency. More than 200 cases have not even gone for trial 20 years after they were registered. There are over 400 cases where charges have not been framed by the courts for over 10 years. 

 The officials hope the agency is heading for better times as it has chalked a comprehensive modernisation project, which is expected to bring about a sea change in its functioning.

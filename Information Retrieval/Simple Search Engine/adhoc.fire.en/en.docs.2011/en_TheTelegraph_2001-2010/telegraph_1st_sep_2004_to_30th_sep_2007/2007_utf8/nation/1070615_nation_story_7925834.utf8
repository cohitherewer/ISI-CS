 Left sees merit in new Patil

 OUR BUREAU

New Delhi/Calcutta, June 14: One Patil left them fretting and fuming. The other got a prompt thumbs up.

 The Left parties, unhappy with the UPAs initial choice of Shivraj Patil as nominee for President, welcomed Pratibha Patils candidature with open arms this evening.

 The CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta hailed Pratibha as a symbol of Indian womanhood. Implicitly admitting to the Lefts opposition to Shivrajs candidature, he said the bitterness of the last few days should now be forgotten.

 The communists had been miffed with the UPA for dropping the Pranab Mukherjee option. The final straw was the ruling coalitions apparent insistence on Shivraj.

 Mukherjees and Shivrajs names had figured in earlier UPA-Left interactions on the presidential poll. But the UPA had kept the Pratibha card close to its chest. Today was the first time the Left got to hear of the possibility of her being fielded for the post.

 Pratibhas name was announced after a hectic meeting spree, with DMK chief M. Karunanidhi acting as mediator between the UPA and the Left. 

 By afternoon, a consensus on Pratibha had emerged. UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi announced her name at the beginning of the second UPA-Left meeting in the evening.

 Countering a reporters suggestion that Pratibha was a political lightweight, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said she met the Lefts three criteria for presidential candidate: the nominee should be a political person, have impeccable secular credentials and be able to deal with conflicts between the legislature, judiciary and the executive.

 CPM general secretary Prakash Karat made light of Left reservations against Shivraj.

 I do not think this is the way the decision was taken. I think the Congress party president and the Prime Minister consulted the various partners of the UPA and also the Left parties and finally we zeroed in on the person who is considered to be the best and the most acceptable, Karat said. 

 RSP leader Abani Roy said his party had not laid down any criteria. The RSP is formally expected to endorse the UPAs choice at its meeting next week.

 Roy, however, was part of the UPA-Left meeting that, according to a joint statement, unanimously decided to field the distinguished woman leader of the country for the top post.

 Forward Bloc general secretary Debabrata Biswas said the Left strategy was finalised at a meeting in Delhi today. 

 We refused to accept Sonias wish list and wanted the Congress to know that the Left cannot be taken for granted, Biswas told reporters in Calcutta after returning from the capital. 

 Biswas said the Congress sought Karunanidhis help to woo the Left when it put forward Karan Singhs name. But despite assurances that Karan was ready to dissociate himself from the Hindu Mahasabha, the Left rejected his name. Going for Shivraj was, of course, out of the question.

 So the Prime Minister sounded the Left about the women candidates, apparently knowing well that it would be difficult for the comrades to oppose them, the Bloc leader said.

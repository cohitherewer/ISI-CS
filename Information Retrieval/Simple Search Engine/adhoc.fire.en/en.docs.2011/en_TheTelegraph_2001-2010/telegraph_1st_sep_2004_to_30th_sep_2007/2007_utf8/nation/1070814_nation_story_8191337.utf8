 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Fighter toddler with doc dream

 Rojen Olivera isnt sure about many things, but he knows what he wants to be if life gives him a chance a doctor.

 The three-year-old possibly cant think of anything else, not when he has spent the past two-and-a half years battling histiocytosis, much of that time on ventilator.

 The disease, which usually afflicts children under 10 and is caused by an excess of malignant tissues, has cost Rs 8.5 lakh. A lot of the money, and pain, has gone into the six cycles of chemotherapy that Rojen has had to endure.

 But if the struggle has been worth it, so has all the help. Many have offered the toddler unconditional support. Some came, played with Rojen and left behind cheques of thousands of rupees. People who we dont know handed over thousands. Even ordinary workers at the Jaslok Hospital contributed Rs 100 each. The hospital, too, waived some bills, said Ronald, Rogens father. 

 When Rogen came home recently after 10 months in special care, his family needed to buy a ventilator. In no time, the device was bought, thanks to more than 400 donors.

 Metro to airport diverted

 The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has decided against connecting the citys domestic and international airports directly to Connaught Place, in the heart of the capital. The about-turn follows safety concerns raised by the Delhi government.

 The Metro rail to the twin airports in Palam, on the outskirts of Delhi, will now run from Connaught Place to Karol Bagh through the Ridge area, Metro officials said. The earlier plan to build the line along the Sardar Patel Marg in Chanakyapuri was vetoed by New Delhi Municipal Corporation, the civic body that oversees Lutyens Delhi.

 The plan was to have the Metro line running alongside the Sardar Patel Marg flyover. The municipal corporation, however, felt the flyover would not remain safe because of the vibrations of the Metro, a Metro official said. 

 New duty for showstopper

 Two years ago, he slammed actress Khushboo for her remarks on sexual freedom. Now, he has a problem with youths who queue up to watch movies too early in the day.

 S. Ramadoss, rarely short of matters to protest, has now trained his guns on the morning, noon and matinee shows, saying they are big a source of distraction for youths. He also slammed TV channels that show movies all day.

 he PMK founder was speaking at a gathering in Vellore, home to a large number of Vanniyars, the OBC group that has rooted for his party in recent elections. The culture cop, on a sacred mission to save Tamil culture, asserted that screenings can be allowed only after 5pm. He made one concession, though: morning shows could be allowed, but this would have to be only on Sundays.

 Ramadosss message would have reached chief minister M. Karunanidhi, once a scriptwriter and still a movie buff. He might have an idea what do with the suggestion to limit screenings. He runs the show, after all.

 Sealing shock

 Delhis long-running sealing drive took a bizarre turn this week when overzealous officials of the civic body allegedly locked up two employees sleeping inside a bakery.

 The incident occurred in the Trilokpuri area, on the eastern flank of the city, where the unauthorised bakery was located. The duo was rescued, but after hours. Vijendra Gupta, who heads the panel on sealing in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, ordered an inquiry and promised action against the officials if found guilty.

 Builder in murder net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 15: A construction magnate who built the citys tallest skyscraper was arrested today on charges of using underworld contract killers to bump off a rival.

 R.R. Chaturvedi of Shreepati Builders was picked up from his Nana Chowk residence in south central Mumbai. He was remanded in police custody till March 20 and faces charges under Section 115 (colluding with other accused) and Section 120-b (conspiracy) of the IPC.

 The arrest comes a fortnight after four sharp-shooters of the Chhota Rajan gang were held near a five-star hotel on March 5. 

 They were about to carry out the contract killing allegedly on Chaturvedis orders. Mohammed Sheikh, 35, Aslam Khan, 40, Qasim Qureshi, 43, and Vijay Wadkar, 37 gave the plot away during interrogation.

 Police say Chaturvedi was locked in a battle with rival Rashmikant Shah of Vijay Group over a Rs 500-crore project to redevelop Abhyudaya Nagar, a lower middle-class colony in central Mumbai, under the slum rehabilitation scheme. 

 Rebuilding a low-income group housing colony entitles developers to sell more space for commercial use, which typically brings in more money.

 Police say Chaturvedi, who was eyeing Shahs land, had given a Rs 50-lakh supari (contract) for killing his adversary in collusion with Udayan Maharaj, a Satara godman. He had also promised a three-star hotel in Mahabaleshwar, a popular hill resort, after the job was done.

 Maharaj got embroiled in the dispute after residents of Abhudaya Nagar approached him with complaints against Shahs Vijay Group for going slow on redevelopment. 

 Shah had allegedly taken the help of don Ashwin Naik and got Maharaj abducted in January. Naik, now in Kalyan central jail, had warned Maharaj to stay out of the deal.

 Chaturvedi has built Shreepati Arcade, a 45-storey skyscraper at Nana Chowk touted as Indias tallest. Made with material capable of withstanding earthquakes, each of its swank flats sells for several crores.

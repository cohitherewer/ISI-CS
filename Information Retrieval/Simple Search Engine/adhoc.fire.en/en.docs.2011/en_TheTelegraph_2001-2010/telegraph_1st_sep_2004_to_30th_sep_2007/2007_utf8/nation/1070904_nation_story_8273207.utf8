 Beijing seeks vigorous ties

 Beijing, Sept. 3 (PTI): China will vigorously implement a bilateral agreement to upgrade relations with India to strategic levels, and is apparently not against Delhis nuclear deal with Washington despite adverse media comments.

 At a meeting with members of the eminent persons group (EPG) here on Friday, foreign minister Yang Jiechi said the Chinese leadership had told him Beijing would vigorously implement the strategic partnership for peace and cooperation the two countries had agreed on.

 The neighbours had agreed to upgrade relations to strategic levels during Premier Wen Jiabaos visit to India in April 2005.

 The Chinese foreign ministry will carry out this instruction to the best of its ability, Yang told the joint delegation led by the former Indian ambassador to China, C.V. Ranganathan, and former Chinese vice-foreign minister Liu Shuqing.

 Yang also welcomed Indias improving relations with the US, Japan and other global powers. There were no negative remarks on the Malabar naval exercises, a senior Indian delegation source said.

 I would say these were two essential points that were conveyed to the Indian side by the Chinese foreign minister, Ranganathan said. 

 The Chinese side did not raise the Indo-US nuclear deal during the two-day meeting, nor were there any hints that it objected to the agreement. In contrast, Chinese media presentations criticised the deal as bad for global nuclear non-proliferation.

 Yang said China was prepared to co-operate with all countries on peaceful nuclear energy based on International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.

 More than this, the Chinese side never said anything, the source said, adding that the Indian delegates had a positive assessment of their meeting with Yang.

 They also said they were looking forward to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to China, though no dates have been announced.

 At the EPG meeting, the Indian side suggested that bilateral consultations should be more vigorous and make full use of existing mechanisms like dialogues on security and strategic issues and foreign office consultations.

 There was an agreement that both sides should speed up the joint study on the regional trade agreement. The study is expected to be over by October.

 In the science and technology sector, both sides agreed that they should jointly study the effects of climate change and try and develop their own model on the complicated subject.

 They also called for an inter-disciplinary dialogue on how the effects of climate change could be mitigated.

 The meeting also called for steps to study how climate change affects the monsoon pattern and its impact on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau.

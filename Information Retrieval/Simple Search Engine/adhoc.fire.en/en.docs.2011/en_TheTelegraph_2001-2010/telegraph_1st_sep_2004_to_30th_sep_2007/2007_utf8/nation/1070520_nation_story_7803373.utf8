 3 killed in Valley storm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Srinagar, May 19: Gusty winds followed by heavy rain wreaked havoc in Kashmir yesterday, killing three persons, destroying houses, damaging crops and snapping power supply to the entire Valley. 

 Hundreds of tourists enjoying boat rides in the Dal Lake were stranded. Rescue operations continued till midnight. 

 Divisional commissioner, Kashmir, Basharat Ahmad Dhar confirmed three deaths, two in Baramulla and one in Kupwara. Several others have been injured. 

 There is extensive damage to property and orchards and a large number of trees and electric poles have been uprooted. We are assessing the loss, he said. But we have restored power supply to essential services. 

 Official sources said hundreds of houses were damaged with the blizzard blowing off rooftops. Fruit crops were also destroyed. 

 Nissar Hussain, chief engineer of the power development department, said power restoration would take several days as the distribution network had suffered extensive damage. 

 Uprooted trees and poles blocked traffic and authorities had a tough time clearing roads.

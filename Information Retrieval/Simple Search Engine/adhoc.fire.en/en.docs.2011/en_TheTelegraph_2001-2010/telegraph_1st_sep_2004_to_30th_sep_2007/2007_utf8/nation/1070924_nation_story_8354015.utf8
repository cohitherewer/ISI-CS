The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Sixer or a catch, mother in agony

 AMIT ROY 

 Yuvrajs mother Shabnam with a friend in London

 London, Sept. 23: The mother of Indian hero Yuvraj Singh has opened her heart to The Telegraph after watching her son smash 70 off 30 balls in Indias thrilling win against Australia in the World Twenty20 semi-final in Durban. 

 Shabnam Singh, who was in London surrounded by half a dozen close friends following the game live on television, spoke last night after taking a call from Yuvraj. 

 I have just spoken to my son, confided Shabnam, who was inundated with calls last night after Australias unexpected ouster. He told me, I dont believe what I have done. I just went berserk. 

 As she went off to see a late-night movie in Leicester Square, she set the record straight about her son apparently being disappointed at not getting the captaincy the claim had been made by Yuvrajs former Test cricketer father, Yograj Singh, who had caused confusion by admitting that he and his son had not actually discussed the topic. 

 Shabnam, who considers herself a single mother, was dismissive of what Yograj had asserted: He (Yograj) said it on his own. It (the claim) is not true. To Yuvraj, it is a great honour just to be playing for his country. 

 However, Shabnam did say both she and Yuvraj now felt he had done enough to merit a regular place in the Test side. 

 He is very passionate about his cricket and he feels he needs to be in the Test side to establish himself as a great player in the way Sachin and others have, she said. 

 Yuvraj had been very depressed after Indias early departure in the World Cup in the Caribbean earlier this year and also after being mauled by Dimitri Mascarenhas for five successive sixes in the one-day international against England at the Oval. 

 He was very upset about it, recalled Shabnam. He said he was getting a lot of calls, with people teasing him. I want a chance to give an answer, he told me. 

 Shabnam, who confirmed that she was very close to her son, said Yuvraj had been emotional. Some very personal things were said. Im very happy to have a mother like you, he said.

 Shabnam had taken calls from many friends after Yuvrajs six sixes in an over but appeared to be unaware that across the global diaspora, wherever there were Indians, there was almost no other talking point. Much the same appeared to be happening again as Yuvrajs name was on Indian lips everywhere. Was she aware how he had united the Indian nation? 

 It is a matter of joy that he has brought happiness to so many people, said Shabnam, who has been in England this summer watching her son play in the one-dayers. 

 She also hinted at what parents have to suffer while their boys are out in the middle. A catch can go anywhere, Shabnam said. 

 Last night, she said, she put a metaphorical Do not disturb sign on the drawing room door as she perched herself in front of the TV set and warned her friends that they were not to call her during the match. 

 After the 14th over of the Australian innings, when the tide seemed to flowing in their direction, Shabnam could not bear the agony any more. 

 One of her friends, Mohan Chopra, a film financier, revealed: She went out of the room to pray.

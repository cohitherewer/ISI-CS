 Fresh trouble for Jaya

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, June 13: ADMK chief Jayalalithaa lurched into fresh trouble today after Madras High Court asked election authorities to take action against her for making false declarations while filing papers for the May 2001 polls.

 The court gave the Election Commission six weeks to move against the former Tamil Nadu chief minister.

 The order came on a petition by DMK MP C. Kuppusamy, who said Jayalalithaa suppressed the fact that she was contesting from four constituencies.

 A candidate cannot contest more than two seats.

 Kuppusamy said after filing papers in Krishnagiri and Andipatti, Jayalalithaa had declared before the returning officers of Bhuvanagiri and Pudukottai that she had not been or would not be nominated as a candidate in more than two constituencies.

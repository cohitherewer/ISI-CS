 Ranchi, June 13: Five students of a school near Ranchi died today after being struck by lightning three of them in their classrooms.

 Bunty Horo, 8, Anima Kachchap, 12, and Vineeta Lakra, 14, were all sitting on benches near the door when the lightning struck around 11 am. Their classrooms were closest to the trees that surround the single-storey building of Green Garden school.

 Other students began to scream and wail, terrified at the sight of their classmates lying dead as the thunderstorm raged outside. 

 More tragedy was in store at the school on the Ranchi-Jamshedpur highway, 25km from the capital. A group of older students, studying in Class X, rushed out in the rain to look for passing vehicles to take the victims to hospital. They had barely headed towards the highway, a kilometre away, when lightning struck again, killing Govind Naik and Anoop Toppo, both 15.

 The dead and the injured, among them the principal, Suresh Lakra, were taken to the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences. Other students remained in a state of trauma even until hours later, and held each other and cried.

 The modest school building did not have a lightning rod or arrester and the trees around it appear to have acted as a super conductor, allowing lightning to hit the most vulnerable students sitting next to the doors. One of the victims was a student of lower KG, two were in Class VI while to more were from Class X.

 Lightning deaths were also reported from other parts of the state and the tentative toll stood at 12 at the end of the day. Seven deaths were reported from Ranchi, two from Lohardaga, two from Hazaribagh and one from Latehar. The figure is expected to rise as reports trickle in from the villages, officials said.

 Parts of the bodies were charred while some were bruised and burnt. At least one of them bled profusely. Six of the injured students lay unconscious in RIMS while the school principal, suffering from trauma, was wheeled into the ICU. 

 The Hindi-medium school has 400 students, mostly from neighbouring villages that fall under the Namkom police station. The school is located between Palandu and the turn to Dasham Falls.

 Head girl Regina Lakra, a student of Class X, recalled that the chapter on The Sound of Music was being taught in the English class when there was a deafening sound. 

 In a reflex action I closed my eyes and ears. When she took off her palms from her ears, the school was filled with the shrieks of students.

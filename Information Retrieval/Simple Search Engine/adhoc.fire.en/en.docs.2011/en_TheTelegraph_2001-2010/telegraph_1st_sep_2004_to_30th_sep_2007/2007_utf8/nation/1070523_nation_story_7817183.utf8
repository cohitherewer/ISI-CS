 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 House-warming time for MLAs

 He has seen 50 years in it. But now, he feels its time to build a new House.

 . Karunanidhi, recently feted for having spent half a lifetime as a lawmaker, has lined up a special gift: a new Assembly complex. Its foundation stone will be laid soon.

 The existing seat of power, inside the historical St. George Fort, with its small enough leg space, might have given many an MLA pain in the joints. 

 Former chief minister Jayalalithaa, too, had grand plans for a new Assembly. As chief minister, she had conceived a structure similar to the majestic Vidan Soudha in Bangalore.

 But her project got stuck in the quicksand of shady land deals. There was also a problem with the sites she chose. One was near the Queen Marys College campus (a heritage building), opposite the Marina Beach. The other, behind the campus of Anna University, wasnt acceptable to academics. But Karunanidhi has side-stepped the minefields. More important, he has promised to complete construction in his current tenure.

 Mumbai blues for hotel

 A restaurant named after Hitler had raised a storm last year. Now, even something as innocuous as Bombay Blue is bad enough to make the radicals see red.

 Activists of the Bharatiya Kamgar Sena (BKS), a Shiv Sena trade union, stormed a mall in Santa Cruz last week, demanding that the Bombay Blue restaurant inside the complex change its name to Mumbai Blue.

 How can they still call it Bombay when government rules say the name of the city is officially Mumbai? said a Kamgar Sena storm trooper. 

 A huge sticker, with Mumbai written over it, was pasted on the hotels nameplate.

 BKS general secretary Jitendra Janawale read the riot act. This (retaining Bombay as the name) will not be tolerated. He claimed the mall had agreed to change the name in a week.

 Hand lost, job elusive

 He lost his hand in a hospital botch-up. 

 Four years later, he is tired of doing the legwork for a job he was promised.

 Vinod Kumar Shukla was given a painkiller in a BMC hospital that first led to a burning sensation in his hand. 

 I was shouting with pain, but the staff said it was a normal side effect. Slowly, my hand became black and cold. The next day, I went to Sion Hospital where the doctors said they would have to amputate my hand.

 Former mayor Mahadev Deole even promised Shukla a job at the same hospital, but he never kept his word. 

 Mayors have changed and so have commissioners. They always say I should wait for job ads. I have got the same reply for the past three years, said the 32-year-old, who was sacked from BEST after he lost his hand. 

 Safe cabs

 Delhiites now have the luxury of opting for an AC cab with a credit card swipe machine and Internet connection. 

 And if trouble strikes, help is just a button away. 

 A hundred Delhi cabs, launched by Orix Auto Infrastructure Services, have been cruising on the capitals roads since early May, offering passengers the chance to stay online while they travel and use the time to pay their bills. 

 The panic button, though, is the most useful feature of the cabs, especially for women travelling alone at night. All the cabs are tracked by the global positioning system.

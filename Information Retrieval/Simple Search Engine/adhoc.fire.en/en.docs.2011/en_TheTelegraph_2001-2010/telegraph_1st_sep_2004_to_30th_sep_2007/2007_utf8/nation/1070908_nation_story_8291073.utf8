 Chandigarh, Sept. 7: Wrestler Dara Singhs son Amrik Singh Randhawa has been put behind bars after his wife complained that he assaulted her last night.

 Amrik has been remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.

 The couple are going through divorce proceedings but live in the same house in Chandigarhs upscale Sector 8.

 In her police complaint, Amrita alleged that her husband barged into her room with three persons, assaulted her and outraged her modesty. He also thrashed a male friend, Rinku Rai, she said.

 Amrik, who runs his fathers studio in Mohali, did not deny the allegation, nor did he seem repentant. He said he lost his temper when he found Amrita had locked herself in the bathroom with Rinku and did not open the front door.

 Amrita denied the allegation and said Rai was a friend.

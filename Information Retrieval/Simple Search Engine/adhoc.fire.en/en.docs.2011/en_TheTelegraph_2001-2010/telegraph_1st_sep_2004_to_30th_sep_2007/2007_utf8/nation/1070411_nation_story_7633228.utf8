 SEZ rehab policy 

 New Delhi, April 10 (PTI): The relief and rehabilitation policy for farmers displaced by land acquisitions for industrial projects and special economic zones will soon be taken to the cabinet.

 We have sent the draft of the policy to the law ministry. After it is vetted by them, we will take it to the cabinet in a matter of days, rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said today.

 Singh indicated that compulsory land acquisition for industrial projects, including SEZs, would not be allowed.

 The empowered group of ministers recently decided to amend the SEZ rules asking states not to go in for compulsory acquisition of land.

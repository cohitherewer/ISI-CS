 Student in obscene art net 

 Vadodara, May 10 (PTI): A student of fine arts has been arrested for hurting religious sentiments by painting Hindu gods and goddesses and Jesus Christ in allegedly obscene postures.

 Chandra Mohan, a postgraduate student at M.S. University and winner of last years Lalit Kala Academy Award, was detained last night for displaying his works at the institutes annual exhibition.

 The arrest followed a complaint filed by Niraj Jain, the general secretary of the BJPs city unit. University authorities said BJP workers entered the campus and damaged some of the exhibits.

 The incident comes days after a countrywide uproar over the Richard Gere-Shilpa Shetty kiss controversy and the more recent court case against artist M.F. Husain, charged with outraging religious sentiments.

 Missed: An adviser Natwar or Aiyar

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Sonia: No guide?

 New Delhi, Aug. 19: The crisis at the Centre has shown up Sonia Gandhis lack of sound political advisers. And the person most sorely missed is perhaps K. Natwar Singh.

 The disgraced former foreign minister used to be the Congress presidents principal adviser on foreign policy when she was leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha.

 His inputs, sources said, played a key role in shaping important Congress decisions at the time, such as the opposition to Indian troops being sent to Iraq in 2003.

 The ruling BJP had been dithering. When its national executive met in Indore in March that year, the foreign policy resolution was changed several times before it adopted an ambivalent position on the war.

 It was only after Sonia spoke her mind to Atal Bihari Vajpayee that the issue was settled: despite US pressure, Indian soldiers would not go to Baghdad. The meeting led to a parliamentary resolution condemning the US attack.

 Had Natwar been around now, would the various Congress Working Committee resolutions have been a little ambiguous on the nuclear deal and perhaps condemned the US role in West Asia?

 Its a question worth pondering over, a Congress functionary said.

 He conceded that had the Iraq oil-for-food scandal not happened and Natwar remained foreign minister, he would still have had little or no leeway in influencing the Prime Ministers single-minded pursuit of the deal.

 But he could at least have supplied correctives to the partys perspective on such issues.

 Mani Shankar Aiyar, the other minister who could have rectified the perceived pro-US tilt, no longer counts as a Sonia adviser.

 Party sources said Sonia, lest she be seen as a surrogate or super Prime Minister, had taken care at party forums not to criticise major government policies, especially its foreign policy.

 Some of the doubts raised in the party during the negotiations were ill-informed ones, voiced by leaders wearing their anti-Americanism on their sleeve. The rest came from knowledgeable junior ministers, too scared to speak out before Sonia or the Prime Minister.

 One of them, who shared his views freely with journalists, was later kept out of the loop.

 Karan Singh, who heads the Congresss foreign policy department, has confined himself to his other role as chairperson of the Indian Council of Cultural Relations and not been active on the nuclear deal.

 Sonias other advisers are believed to be clueless about the deal. When she raised certain concerns, they were reportedly addressed by the Prime Ministers national security adviser, M.K. Narayanan, and the ambassador to the US, Ronen Sen.

 The larger problem for Sonia was dealing with the Left.

 Sources said that while she struck some sort of rapport with Sitaram Yechury and A.B. Bardhan, she never managed to crack the key man, Prakash Karat. Her political secretary, Ahmed Patel, too, is comfortable with Yechury.

 Through the UPA governments existence, the Congresss attitude to the Left had been shaped by its own notions about the communists.

 The Prime Minister and other Congress leaders, except Pranab Mukherjee, seriously believed that the CPM was split at various levels Bengal versus Kerala, moderates (Yechury, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Jyoti Basu) versus purists (Karat) and that it was enough to work on one lot and isolate the other.

 They were so convinced that the Prime Ministers hotline with the Bengal chief minister would take care of possible flashpoints such as the Indo-US joint military exercises that they wondered why Bhattacharjee could not prevail on the cadres who protested in Kalaikunda.

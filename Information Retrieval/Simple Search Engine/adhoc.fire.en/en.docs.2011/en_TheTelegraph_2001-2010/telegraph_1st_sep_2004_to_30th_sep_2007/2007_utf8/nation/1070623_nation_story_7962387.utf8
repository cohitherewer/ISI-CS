 The Great Sister, now on screen

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, June 22: Lalu Prasad may have a chalisa in his name but Mayavati will have a full-length feature film on her life.

 Moradabad-based producer Kailash Masoom plans to shoot a biopic on the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, titled Behenji: The Great Sister.

 Masoom, who will himself direct the Rs 3-crore film, has produced a movie on controversial Mumbai bar dancer Tarannum, titled Dastan-e-Tarannum.

 He told a news conference at Moradabad yesterday that he planned to hire Jackie Shroff to play Mayavatis political opponent Raja Bhaiyya, Aloke Nath for the role of her mentor Kanshi Ram, and Ravindra Jain to do the score. A new face, Pratibha Mannan, has been chosen to play Mayavati.

 The film, to be released in November this year, will be about Mayavatis struggle for Dalits and her human qualities behind the austere political face. But it will side-step all controversies involving her because these cases are in court.

 In Lucknow, one of Mayavatis secretaries said: The chief minister is unaware of any such project. But the Moradabad announcement by a director is being looked into.

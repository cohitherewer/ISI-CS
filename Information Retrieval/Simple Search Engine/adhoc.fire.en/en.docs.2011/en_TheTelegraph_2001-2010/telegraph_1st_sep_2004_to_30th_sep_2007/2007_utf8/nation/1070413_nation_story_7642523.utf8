 Vajpayee

 New Delhi, April 12: Atal 

 Bihari Vajpayee today broke his silence on the CD drama. 

 Why didnt people watch the CD before it was 

 circulated? We should have been more careful, he reportedly 

 told Arun Jaitley, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Mukhtar Abbas 

 Naqvi, who briefed him on the issue.

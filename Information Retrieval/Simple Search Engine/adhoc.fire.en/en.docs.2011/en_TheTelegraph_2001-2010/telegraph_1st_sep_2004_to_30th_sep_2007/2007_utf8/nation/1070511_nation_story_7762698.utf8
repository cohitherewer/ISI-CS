 Kalam theory at Sonia meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 10: Sonia Gandhi today followed up the initiative taken by the Prime Minister to consult allies on the presidential election, meeting the CPIs A.B. Bardhan, Forward Blocs Debabrata Biswas and the RJDs Lalu Prasad this morning.

 Biswas quoted the UPA chairperson as saying the Congress had not discussed specific names for the Presidents post as it wanted to assess the views of the allies first.

 The UPA wants to first have broad discussions and asked what we were thinking, whether we had specific names in mind, he said.

 The PMO, too, said news reports mentioning specific names are speculative and premature, but confirmed that the Prime Minister has had some preliminary and exploratory discussions with some political leaders.

 Biswas said the Left was against giving A.P.J. Abdul Kalam a second term and brought to Sonias attention a statement in a speech he made in Parliament today, favouring a two-party political system.

 I told her the political situation is complex in a multi-party system. Kalams formula is also L.K. Advanis pet formula. I said, Kalam may be a good scientist, so his place is in the laboratory from where he can start his mission, the Forward Bloc MP said.

 Biswas also told her that the Left was against giving Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat a second term. He said the leaders would indicate their choice after a coordination committee meeting on May 16.

 It is believed that Lalu Prasad has said the RJD would go along with the Congresss choice.

 Sonia told the leaders that the partys core committee would meet on Saturday to discuss the presidential election and the Uttar Pradesh verdict.

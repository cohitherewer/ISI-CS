 Papa dont preach, Liz is going ballistic

 - woes after wedding

 AMIT ROY 

 Arun and Liz

 London, April 9: A ballistic Elizabeth Hurley has hit back at her father-in-law, Vinod Nayar, saying she could not understand his hostility towards her after all she had done to raise the Nayar familys social standing in India.

 This was in response to yesterdays comments by Vinod, who said he felt humiliated at the treatment that he had allegedly suffered at the hands of his now disowned son, Arun, and Hurley, at their wedding ceremonies in England and Jodhpur. 

 A source close to the 41-year-old actress (who might be Hurley herself) told the Daily Mail: Liz was furious and went absolutely ballistic when she found out what Aruns family had been saying about her. She feels that what was the happiest day of her life has been tarnished and doesnt understand how after everything she has done for them raising their social standing in India through the roof, for example they could do this. 

 The source added: But quite frankly, she is also a little bewildered by all of this and was totally unaware about the extent of their grievances. Liz feels she made every effort to be a part of their extended family and fit in. 

 It was pointed out: She doesnt think that they have taken into consideration how much planning went into the wedding celebrations she was under a lot of pressure and was very, very stressed, and perhaps they misinterpreted this for rudeness. 

 Yesterday, Vinod had described how upset he had been that Hurley had refused to put on a 35,000 diamond and ruby necklace he had bought for her to wear at the Hindu wedding ceremony. And, afterwards, he had cancelled a post-wedding party, costing 30,000, he had planned for the couple in Mumbai. 

 Now, Liz has even offered to reimburse the Nayars if they feel theyre out of pocket and hopes that this will be the end of the matter, the source added. Yet as far as she is concerned, that is it she never wants to see Aruns father or stepmother again. 

 It is understood that a letter written by Vinod to his son, informing him that he wished to cut all ties, is still awaiting response, according to the Daily Mail. 

 Hurley, whose own family background is respectable but decidedly modest her father was a captain in the Royal Army Educational Corps and her mother a music teacher may not see the irony in her suggestion that association with her has upped the social status of the Nayars. 

 Elizabeth Hurley both looks and speaks the part of an upper-class girl from the Home Counties, Hurleys biographer, Alison Bowyer, has observed waspishly. But the image is an illusion. Weekends in country houses and expensive Swiss finishing schools were not on the agenda for the young Elizabeth. Her ancestors had been housemaids in such houses, and home for Liz Hurley was a modest bungalow. 

 In newspaper blogs today, readers expressed their feelings. 

 I agree wholeheartedly with her father-in-law! I think I would do the same if my son was daft enough to marry her! noted Desmond from Devon.

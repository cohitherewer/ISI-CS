 Sting fury singes Shakti

 Ujjain, April 2 (PTI): Actor Shakti Kapoor was manhandled at a programme here allegedly by some activists of the Bhartiya Nari Shakti organisation and Bajrang Dal who accused him of being involved in exploiting women. 

 The activists allegedly garlanded Kapoor with a black cloth and slapped him when he was sitting on the dais last night. Kapoor was about to receive the Teppa Samman for his contribution to popularising the art of comedy in films. 

 The award was instituted by an organisation which holds the Akhil Bhartiya Teppa Sammelan every year in Ujjain. 

 The activists said he did not deserve the award after his alleged involvement in exploiting women as exposed by a TV channel.

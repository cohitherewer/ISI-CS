 Prices, terror on House table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: Price rise, terror attacks and special economic zones will dominate the budget session beginning tomorrow, now that the shadow of Presidents rule on Uttar Pradesh has receded.

 Breathing a sigh of relief for not having to choose between Sonia Gandhi and Mulayam Singh Yadav in the House, the Left has decided to concentrate on price rise, SEZs and the general economic situation. 

 The Samjhauta Express blasts will figure as part of a larger discussion on terrorism and national security. The BJP, the main Opposition party, is going to move an adjournment motion on terror. Left leaders said they, too, would focus on the blasts but have no plans of bringing an adjournment motion.

 With the Centres claims of a high growth rate being offset by galloping prices of essential commodities, finance minister P. Chidambaram has been facing flak from all corners, including his own party. 

 At a Congress Working Committee meeting earlier this week, he faced a barrage of questions on why the prices were spiralling out of control.

 The Lefts main thrust will be to get the government to review some of its crucial policies like futures trading in commodities, which the communists say is a continuation of the NDA regimes policies. 

 The Congress, for its part, will try again to push through the pension and banking regulation bills. The Left has rejected both.

 The SEZ act will also form a crucial part of the deliberations. The Left parties have submitted a note to the Congress leadership recommending amendments to the act that they expect will help the Bengal government on its SEZ policies. Sanctions to SEZ projects have been stalled till the act is amended.

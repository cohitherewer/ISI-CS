 Doctor cloud on punter suicide

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 4: The gambler who was yesterday found bleeding across the road from the Prime Ministers residence was unlikely to have shot himself, the doctor who treated him said today, throwing a spanner into polices suicide theory. 

 Delhi police, probing the case, say Kishore Lal Sehgal has told them he shot himself because his wife Rina was intimately involved with another man, Jeetendra. 

 According to the police, Sehgal told them Rina and Jeetendra had been harassing and blackmailing him for close to a year before he turned the gun on himself. 

 Doctor S.K. Sharma at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, who has been treating Sehgal, has, however, raised questions over the police premise of suicide. 

 The bullet wound on Sehgals right upper chest was unlikely to have been self-inflicted, he said. 

 It is very unlikely that he shot himself, given the nature of the wound, he said today. 

 According to Sharma, right-handed Sehgal would have had to twist his hand unnaturally to shoot himself where he did. It would have been much more natural for him to have shot himself on his left chest. 

 The angle or rather, the lack of it at which the bullet was fired, he said, accentuated the puzzle. 

 If he wanted to shoot himself on the right chest, it would have made sense if he were to hold the gun around waist height, pointed upwards. The bullet, however, has been fired with the gun parallel to the ground... thats surprising, he said. 

 The police, however, insisted Sehgal shot himself and denied that the incident had any connection with the lakhs he owed money lenders at the Jaipur Polo Grounds and Race Course, outside which he was found. 

 The police cited a two-page suicide note which they claimed to have recovered from Sehgals white Maruti Zen after the incident. 

 Two officials of the Special Protection Group that reached the spot first have, however, said they did not see any note in the car at that time. 

 According to the police, Sehgal had lent Rs 4 lakh to Rina. Unable to repay the amount, Rina and Jeetendra had threatened to blackmail him.

 Police officials were, however, unable to explain what secret Rina and Jeetendra had threatened to expose. 

 Sehgals fellow punters say Sehgal was not the kind of man to commit suicide. 

 His brother Govind said he, too, was surprised at the news that his brother had tried killing himself. 

 It is true that Rina and Jeetendra were involved in a relationship and that my brother was stressed about it, he said. Govind is yet to meet his brother after the firing. 

 He also confirmed that Sehgal was heavily in debt with lenders from the race course.

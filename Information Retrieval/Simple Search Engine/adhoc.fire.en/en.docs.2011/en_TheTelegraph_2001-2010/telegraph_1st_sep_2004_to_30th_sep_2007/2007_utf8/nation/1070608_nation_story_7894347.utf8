 The Truth, with Blair amp; Bachchan

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Yorkshire, June 7: Gore first, Blair next, with Bachchan to boot.

 After Al Gore, Tony Blair tottering on the last leg of his political career is doing his bit for the climate change campaign. 

 After An Inconvenient Truth, the former American Vice-Presidents Oscar-winning film on the effects of global warming, the outgoing British Prime Minister will appear in a short film that talks about the hazards of carbon.

 The film, which also features Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan and Hollywood actresses Sienna Miller and Heather Graham, will premiere at the IIFA Awards night in Sheffield on Saturday.

 According to sources, the semi-fictionalised film, which has a tagline of They needed a billion people to help save the planet, stars Blair as a future Prime Minister of the UK faced with the problem of global warming! 

 The film is as much about Bachchan as it is about Blair and, hence, the IIFA-Global Cool tie-up. With Indias population of more than a billion and the countrys colourful entertainment industry, we have gone for a 10-year planet-saving partnership with IIFA, said Julian Knight, chief operating officer of Global Cool. 

 Prince Charles, in a specially prepared video message, said how business and environment are dependent on each other rather than being an either-and-or challenge. The stakes could not have been higher nor the situation more urgent, he said.

 Bachchan, who was present at the Leeds Town Hall to launch the IIFA weekend, was all for a fight against global warming. It can happen and it will happen if all the people come together to spread the awareness, said the actor. 

 I was so happy to walk up the stairs of the Town Hall on the green carpet rather than the traditional red carpet.

 Britains darling Shilpa Shetty was, of course, a lot more prepared. Wearing a green top to celebrate the new campaign, she said: I am happy to leverage my name in such an important and pertinent cause.

 Maybe Shilpa, alongside Blair and Bachchan, would have been a better idea than Miller and Graham.

 Cops look into star complaint

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bachchan

Lucknow, Aug. 22: A police team from Juhu is in Uttar Pradesh to probe actor Amitabh Bachchans allegation that his power of attorney was misused by Vinay and Vijay Shukla in the Barabanki land deal.

 Deputy commissioner V.K. Chaubey said in Mumbai: We are still inquiring into the complaint filed by Amitabh Bachchan. We have sent a team of Juhu police to Uttar Pradesh to verify details of the complaint. The team is expected to return tomorrow. We are yet to reach a conclusion.

 Bachchan has blamed the irregularities in the deal, which is at the centre of a controversy, on Shukla.

 The 2.5-bigha plot in Barabanki was bought in violation of state laws and a farmer certificate obtained for the actor so that he could buy farmland in Pune. 

 Maharashtra does not allow non-farmers to buy agricultural land.

 In various media reports, it has been alleged that the certificate shown to me by Mr Vijay Kumar Shukla was obtained by improper means, Bachchan said in his police complaint.

 It appears that he has also wrongly given my address as 17, Clive Road, Allahabad in certain proceedings. Kindly register an FIR and investigate the matter. 

 A four-member police team, led by senior inspector S.K. Tadalpurka, met the tehsildar, sub-divisional magistrate and additional district magistrate of Barabanki at Fatehpur tehsil. 

 Vijay Shukla, who met the Mumbai policemen, later flatly denied misusing the actors papers. I am not sure if the superstar has accused me and my brother of anything. It is a media creation. We never misrepresented facts and never gave him a fake document showing government allotment of some agricultural land in his name, he said. 

 Bachchan is reported to have withdrawn his power of attorney.

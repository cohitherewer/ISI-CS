 Court lock on tainted pumps

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 12: The Supreme Court today ordered closure of over 100 petrol pumps and other petroleum product outlets allotted during the NDA regime on extraneous considerations in eight states. They must comply with the order within three months.

 In August 2002, the NDA regime had cancelled all allotments made since January 2000 after a public outcry. 

 But with owners challenging the blanket revocations, the Supreme Court had granted an interim relief. It set aside the order and appointed a two-judge committee to examine 413 specific cases of allotment. 

 The retired judges, one each from Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court, scrutinised 409 cases and found 297 allotments, in 14 states, not based on merit.

 The petrol pumps and retail outlets that were today asked to close today had been open so far because of the interim protection given four years ago. Some borderline cases scrutinised got the benefit of doubt. Others are yet to be examined individually.

 The court agreed with the findings of the review committee, but said it would consider a complaint from an owner who can prove he got his pump on merit.

 In Jharkhand, the judges panel had found that of the 12 allotments picked for scrutiny, nine were not given on merit. The apex court picked up five of the nine, and agreed with the panels finding on four cases. Allotments in Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana were also reviewed.

 Children showcased in maid market

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Dec. 31: Eleven-year-old Savitri sits on the floor of a wayside eatery along with some other girls her age.

 The owner of the eatery, Govinda Rao, has been on the phone since morning, describing the girls huddled before him. He is talking to prospective clients who will hire these girls as domestic helps on an annual contract. 

 When a caller expresses interest in a girl, Govinda asks her to bring her parents and seal the deal. An okay means the client can come and pick up his stock. 

 Govinda is not the only resident of Mantada who is in this business. The village, which stands by the highway between Vijayawada and Machilipatnam, has been sending its young girls to work as maids in cities and towns all over the country, including Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore.

 Savitris mother Vijayalakshmi believes she is ensuring happiness for her daughter. I am sending my daughter away not because I need more money, but because I want her to be safe and live in a healthy environment, she said.

 The mother has reason to be proud. A wealthy Marwari family from Mumbai has chosen Savitri and offered to pay Rs 25,000 for a three-year contract. If they like her, they will also arrange her marriage and keep her permanently in their huge house, said Ramakrishna, another broker from the village. 

 Mantada, about 40 km from Vijayawada, has a population of 5,000 and most of them are labourers in sugarcane farms. The seasonal crop does not provide them regular employment, which is why they have to look for alternative means of livelihood, said Raja Rao, a farmer who owns half an acre of land.

 The supply of children for domestic labour has grown into an organised trade here. Virtually every family sends a child, and the village has more than 25 brokers, who take home a 15-20 per cent cut from both the buyer and seller.

 According to a rough estimate, almost 15,000 girls from Mantada are working in homes across the country. Many of them have also married and are living happily. But we also have cases of 10 to 24 deaths, which we have resolved amicably, said Babu Rao, a broker. 

 According to the contract, compensation is paid if the girl dies or is injured or becomes pregnant. But the decision of the broker is final and binding, and no one can go to police or seek any other modes of justice, said village elder Gopalakrishna Rao, a former sarpanch.

 However, the business had run into rough weather for a while after the trafficking was exposed and cases were booked against 25 people, including some parents. But things soon returned to normal and the brokers were back in business. Villagers do not cooperate and they plead with us not to intervene, said superintendent of police M.K. Singh. 

 Anti-child labour activist Shanta Sinha feels a few arrests are not enough to do away with a decades-old practice. But it is appalling, shocking and outrageous that right under our nose and hardly a few hundred kilometres from the cyber capital of India, adolescent girls are carted off like cattle.

 The Krishna district administration has begun a house-to-house survey to keep a record of all children between five and 16 in Mantada. But the villagers are not worried. Its an issue of our livelihood. No official monitoring can stop it, declared Prabhavatamma, the mother of one of the children who has bagged a contract.

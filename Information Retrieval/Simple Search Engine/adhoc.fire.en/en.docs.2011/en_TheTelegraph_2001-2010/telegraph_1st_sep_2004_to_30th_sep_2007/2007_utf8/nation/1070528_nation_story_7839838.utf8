 Name game, now for MP jails

 Bhopal, May 26: Subhas Chandra Bose, Guruji Golwalkar, Shankar Dayal Sharma and Tantiya Tope symbolised freedom, in their own ways. Now, their names will adorn places that epitomise captivity.

 Jails in Madhya Pradesh will bear the names of these prominent leaders, giving the BJP government a much-needed choice. It has almost run out of roads, airports and buildings that can be renamed. 

 On June 12, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan will attend the first of these events in Jabalpur, whose central jail will be renamed Subhas Chandra Bose Jail. According to Shailendra Tiwari, the convener of the Netaji Subhas Manch, Bose was imprisoned in the jail during the freedom struggle. 

 At present, a block in the jail is called the Subhas ward. Tiwari would like the entire jail to be converted into a memorial to Bose, in the shape of a museum. The jail can be shifted.

 Bhopal Central Jail will be called Shankar Dayal Sharma Jail. A famous son of Bhopal, he was a freedom fighter and Union minister before becoming President in 1992.

 Jails minister Attar Singh Arya said the Betul jail will be named after Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, fondly called Guruji Golwalkar. 

 The RSS ideologue spent more than a month in the jail after his arrest in Nagpur in 1949. At present, the barracks number one, where Golwalkar was incarcerated, is home to over a dozen criminals and undertrials.

 Betuls BJP MLA Shivprasad Rathore said he would urge Chauhan to declare the barracks a monument of historical importance.

 In July, Chauhan plans to dedicate the Shivpuri jail to Tantiya Tope, a hero of the first war of independence in 1857. Tope was kept in the jail before his public hanging on April 18, 1859.

 Arya said several other jails, including those in Gwalior, Khandwa, Ujjain and Indore, will have new names. As we celebrate 150 years of Independence, we must remember the names and contribution of our national heroes. 

 A panel of eminent persons will be formed to suggest names, Arya said.

 Sources said the Khandwa district jail is likely to be named after Tantya Bheel, a tribal freedom fighter who had put up strong resistance against the British forces during 1872-88.

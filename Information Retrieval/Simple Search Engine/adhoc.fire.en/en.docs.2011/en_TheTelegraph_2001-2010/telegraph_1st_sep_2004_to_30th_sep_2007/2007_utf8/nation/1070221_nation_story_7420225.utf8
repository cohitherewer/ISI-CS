 Count over, search begins for lost kin

 Panipat, Feb. 20: The body count is over. The identification continues to be excruciating. The stench of death is all pervading.

 Mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, sons and sons-in-law continued to trickle in at the civil hospital here for information on their relatives. While some returned with smiles on their faces, happy to know that their loved ones had returned safe, some were not that fortunate.

 The tears have dried in Afak Hussains eyes. Having travelled all the way from Farukkhabad in Uttar Pradesh to know the fate of six of his relatives after coming to know of the Samjhauta Express tragedy on television yesterday, Hussain went through the painful ordeal of identifying their charred remains.

 I have identified all six two sisters, two sisters-in-law and their two children. I want to take them to Karachi so that they can be buried. But can I take them? The six, who had been laughing and joking two days ago, now only have numbers tagged on them. God has been very cruel to us. Terrorists have no right to end the lives of innocents. What had they done to them? he mumbled, trying hard to hold back tears.

 Hussain could identify four bodies last evening. Today, he went through the ordeal again to identify his niece Mehak and nephew Ahsan. I have identified my relatives from the jewellery, the clothes, the handkerchief that was clutched in the palm of my aunt and from tags on their innerwear, he said.

 Not far from Hussain sat Nasir Khan. He had come from Rampur in Uttar Pradesh to identify his 54-year-old sister Ara, who had come from Karachi. They have taken away a beautiful person, said a tearful Khan.

 Only 12 bodies have been identified so far. Doctors, district administration officials, railway staff, social organisations and security agencies are at a loss on how to identify the rest of the victims or determine their nationality. Many bodies are so charred that only DNA tests can identify them, a doctor said.

 The Haryana government has requisitioned the services of at least 50 doctors and forensic experts from neighbouring districts. The experts were brought in to help in post-mortems and also evaluate steps for identification. Rooms in the hospital have been segregated for forensic post-mortems.

 Several Pakistani nationals whose relatives had perished are yet to arrive at the hospital. They are expected tonight after the evening ceremony at Wagah gets over. They will be here late tonight or tomorrow, a police officer said.

 The civil authorities have made arrangements to provide information to people, which had not been put in place yesterday. A separate desk for information on dead Pakistani nationals has been set up. 

 The army, too, has posted its personnel inside the hospital complex. It is a tragedy for the world, a jawan lamented.

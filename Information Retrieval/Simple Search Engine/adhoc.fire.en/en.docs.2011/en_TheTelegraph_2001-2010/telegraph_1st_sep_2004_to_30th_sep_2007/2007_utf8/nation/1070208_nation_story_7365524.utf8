The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Election won, but cover not blown

 Mumbai: Afreen 

 Khan is a

 councillor.

 But ask the residents of Mazagaon and Madanpura who voted her last week how she looks and theyd give a blank stare.

 Throughout her campaign for the Mumbai civic polls and after it, Afreen has remained behind a veil. And she doesnt intend to lift it in a hurry, not even for the general body meeting. 

 Her family, Afreen says, has adhered strictly to the tradition for several generations. I wouldnt want to show any disrespect by not abiding with the tradition. 

 At the general body meeting, however, she wont be the only one with her face hidden.

 Waqarunnisa, a Congress councillor, also attends meetings in a burqa, though she is known to lift her veil often.

 Afreen doesnt see the veil as a deterrent in her work. Developing municipal schools, solving water problems and repairing the drainage system can be done from behind the cover.

 Young? Join the queue

 Chennai: Chennai

 is known for

 its partiality

 to movies but

 all queues

 in the city

 need not lead

 to the box

 office.

 naking lines of youngsters clutching folders are a frequent sight in the southern city now. It only signals one thing: the IT tigers are back on the prowl.

 Many tech titans are on a hiring spree in the city over the last few days. Conference rooms of even smaller hotels have been converted into impromptu recruitment centres with the queues spilling out of many of them.

 The rush comes as a 10-km-long IT Corridor, which passes by a software park in south Chennai on its way to the tourist resort of Mamallapuram, is nearing completion. 

 Once completed, the four-lane highway, lined with sculptures in stone and walls featuring paintings, is expected to offer an international feel to the techie traveller.

 Schindlers chronicler

 Delhi: From 

 a youth spent

 as a Catholic

 priest, through

 a brief brush

 with teaching

 to penning

 the story

 behind the

 Oscar-winning Schindlers

 List,

 Thomas Keneallys

 life has

 been a fascinating

 journey.

 His current

 stop is

 Delhi. 

 Keneally, whose Booker Prize-winning Schindlers Arc was the basis for Steven Spielbergs critically acclaimed movie, is in the capital after a four-day visit to Calcutta. 

 The 71-year-old Australian author is attending a conference on cultural diversity, governance and policy in India and Australia being organised jointly by the Australia-India Council and the Indira Gandhi National Open University. 

 At a dinner Tuesday night, Keneally could be heard animatedly discussing the Cauvery water dispute with other delegates.

 Keneally has been nominated for the Booker on three other occasions The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1972), Gossip from the Forest (1975) and in 1979 for Confederates.

 Police BPO

 Hyderabad: The 

 outsourcing

 bug has bitten

 the city police

 as well.

 Unable to cope with peak-hour traffic, they have decided to hire private guards to man the roads of Hyderabad.

 Traffic police chief A.K. Khan says NCC and NSS cadets might also be used. It will help the force attend to law and order problems.

 In the first batch, 50 private guards will be recruited to work as traffic wardens.

 They will get regular uniforms, caps and belts but no power to make an arrest or book a case.

 Chennai: You

 can catch up with Nobel

 laureate Amartya Sen.

 He will deliver a lecture

 on health and

 society at the

 Voluntary Health

 Services (VHS) Hospital

 in Adyar, South Chennai,

 on Saturday. 

 Time:

 4 pm 

 Admission:

 Open to all

 Singapore term for terror hoax

 Singapore, June 6 (AP): An Indian-origin Canadian who made hoax calls to police claiming there was a terrorist on board an Air India flight has been sentenced to three years and eight months in prison by a Singapore court.

 District judge Victor Yeo on Monday convicted Nanda Sudhir Kumar, 53, on three counts of communicating false threats of terrorism acts, an offence under the United Nations Anti-Terrorism Regulations. 

 The city state adopted the regulations after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks in the US.

 Kumar made three calls from public phones to the police on November 6, alleging that a terrorist was on board the Air India flight from Singapore to New Delhi and would crash the plane, court documents showed.

 The flight was subsequently delayed for over three hours for the plane to be offloaded and bomb-swept. Kumar was arrested a week later and charged in January.

 Kumar, who could have been fined up to $65,000 and jailed for five years, is out on bail and has appealed the sentence, his lawyer said.

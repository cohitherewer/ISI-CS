The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Traffic terror? Learn from south

 Hyderabad has shown Calcutta how to take an insurance against disruption before the budget session begins. 

 Hearing a PIL filed by an advocate, the Andhra Pradesh High Court ruled that the city cannot be held hostage by political activists.

 Schoolchildren, people going to work or patients being rushed to hospital have a right to reach their destinations on time and the administration and police are bound to ensure that, it said.

 The petitioner wanted all those who obstruct public life to be punished and damages for property destroyed during protests. 

 Political parties are the same, be it Bengal or Andhra Pradesh and sit-ins, roadblocks and protest meetings throwing a spanner in normal life are par for course in the state capital. On February 1, the Congress, Telugu Desam, BJP and the Telengana Rashtra Samiti blocked two national highways demanding IITs at Basar and Medak districts. 

 Mystery of missing clothes

 Dhobis here are wrestling with a particularly stubborn stain. 

 Clothes are being stolen from their bicycles parked on the premises of housing societies, giving the dhobis a bad name.

 The thefts, largely centred around Chembur and Tilak Nagar in north-east Mumbai, are making some residents reluctant about trusting the dhobis with their clothes. 

 I had to pay Rs 6,000 to one customer as nine of his clothes were in the bundle. Compare this with my profit around 50 paisa on a customer, says Goldie Nirmal, employed at a laundry in Tilak Nagar. Some dhobis are putting the total value of clothes stolen over the last two months at Rs 4 lakh but there is no official confirmation. 

 The prime suspect is a group of drug addicts but police have not been able to crack the case yet. 

 Reunion bells

 When a

 Tamil star calls on

 a politician, the plot

 can have only one ending:

 the political plunge.

 Prabhu, the son of the late screen colossus Sivaji Ganesan, had a more pressing reason to drop in at 10 Janpath. 

 The proud papa wanted to invite Sonia Gandhi to his son Vikrams wedding on February 26.

 Tamil Nadu politicians are now placing bets on whether Prabhu would join the party his father was once associated with. A disenchanted Ganesan had eventually left the Congress.

 Prabhu now seems to have put the familys bitterness behind him. Sonia, too, has helped matters by giving her blessings to the installation of a statue of Ganesan near Marina Beach. 

 Mobile match

 Fancy watching TV on your mobile? On and off in Delhi, for the last several weeks, Doordarshan has been experimenting with technology that allows it to beam its regular programmes to cellphones with a special chip. 

 The right kind of mobile phones are not yet being sold in India. But if you happened to have bought one elsewhere you just might catch a trial in Delhi. 

 The day when India played West Indies in the last one-dayer of their cricket series, Singapore-based Nokia executive Pawan Gandhi was seen fiddling with his phone, switching between the match and other DD channels. DD has partnered with his company to bring in the DVB-H (Direct Video Broadcast-Handheld) technology. Any DVB-H phone would catch the signal.

 Left says sorry, but doesnt condemn

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 13: The CPM leadership in Parliament regretted the sordid scenes in the Lok Sabha today and the intemperate behaviour of its MPs. It, however, refused to condemn the incident in which party MPs, for the first time in Parliament, were seen snatching papers from a minister.

 The Left came close to blows with another UPA ally the DMK. 

 But all this warranted only a statement of regret, not one of condemnation. We are not condemning the incident. Passions were aroused and this resulted in the scenes, said politburo member Sitaram Yechury.

 Passions have been aroused earlier, too, particularly on the issue of womens reservation, when the Lok Sabha has seen members coming to blows. 

 MPs from the Hindi belt led by the Yadav duo Mulayam Singh and Lalu Prasad have grabbed the bill from the hands of parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and tore it to shreds. 

 Opponents of the bill claimed it was an emotional issue and they could not allow it to be passed in the House without a sub-quota.

 The CPM today conveyed similar sentiments. 

 It was an emotive issue that triggered such unpleasantness, the party said. 

 But what was under scrutiny was the manner of expressing anger. Yechury, however, made a distinction between the rowdy incidents triggered by the bill and those by the differences over the maritime engineering institute.

 There is a difference in the situation. Our party has regretted the incident. Those who created scenes on the reservation issue never expressed regret, he said.

 Its usually the Hindiwallahs who shout and flex muscles in Parliament. But the Marxists at least since the UPA came to power have kept away from messy scenes. Todays display of anger was unusual.

 Assam blast kills one

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Sept. 1: A blast ripped through a market at Bamunimaidam Railway Colony this morning killing a man from Bihar and injuring 24 persons. Five shops were gutted and several vehicles damaged after a LPG cylinder burst in an eatery under the impact of the explosion. 

 The area was teeming with people at the time of the explosion. 

 The intensity of the explosion reduced an auto van parked at the site to a mangled heap of metal.

 The victim, a cobbler, has been identified as Ram Lal Das, 60, a resident of Begusarai district in Bihar. Das, who stayed with his nephew at Bamunimaidam, was in his shop when the bomb exploded.

 According to police, a timer device planted on the van exploded around 11.50am. The owner of the van has been picked up for interrogation, the police added. 

 No outfit has claimed responsibility for the blast.

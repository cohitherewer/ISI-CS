 Rest house sleaze cry

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Sept. 7: A 70-year-old Congress MP who was allegedly caught frolicking with two women in a government rest house worked Haryana politics up to a frenzy today.

 Sirsa MP Atma Singh Gill, father of eight, issued press handouts this evening saying the women were relatives. He said he was driving from Chandigarh to Sirsa yesterday but it had got too dark by the time he had reached Narwana in Jind, and so he decided to spend the night at the rest house.

 The Opposition Indian National Lok Dal, however, insisted the MP had been drunk and in a highly objectionable state, and should be arrested and expelled from the Lok Sabha.

 A huge mob had surrounded the rest house after whispers spread that Gill had landed up there with two women, Jind police chief Jagwant Singh Lamba told reporters.

 We went in and verified that he was with two women relatives. He was taken away safely, he said, giving the ruling party MP a clean chit.

 The police took the MP and the women out through a side door. They did not register a case, INLD leader Ram Singh Brar alleged. Liquor bottles and empty glasses were found in the room though drinking is banned in government rest houses.

 Brar alleged that Gill had failed to sign on the guest register, mandatory for anyone occupying a room.

 The police have accepted a complaint from the MP, a Dalit, seeking action under the SC/ST Act against those who had barged into his room.

 Gill held a news conference late this evening in Fatehabad but spoke not a word. He walked out as soon as a district official had finished handing out the press release, which praised the police for saving the MP and his relatives from the clutches of INLD workers.

 Gill is believed to have told journalists earlier in the day that he had merely given a lift to the two women and that he knew one of them.

 INLD workers and leaders burnt effigies of Gill across Haryana today. The BJP, too, has decided to hold state-wide protests.

 The Congress is known to use rest houses for immoral activities whenever the party is in power, BJP leader Krishna Pal Gurjar said.

 INLD state chief Ashok Arora and general secretary Ajay Singh Chautala said the incident had shamed Haryana.

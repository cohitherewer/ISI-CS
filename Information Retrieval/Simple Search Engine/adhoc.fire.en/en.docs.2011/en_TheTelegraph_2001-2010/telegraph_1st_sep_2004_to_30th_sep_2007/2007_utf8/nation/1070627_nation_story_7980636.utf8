 Left on ship warpath

 OUR BUREAU

 The Nimitz

 New Delhi, June 26: The CPM today decided to rally Left cadre for protests in Chennai against the port call by the American super-carrier, the USS Nimitz, even as the defence ministry said this was not the first time a nuclear-powered vessel would be in India. 

 The ship is scheduled in Indian waters in the first week of July for the second time in two years.

 It looks like an ordinary event. For us it is not an ordinary event, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said after the partys central committee meeting that ended today. 

 He said the visit was particularly symbolic of the aggressiveness of the US. Karat was reacting to defence minister A.K. Antonys comment yesterday that the port call was a routine affair.

 The US embassy in a statement last evening said the visit of the Nimitz was symbolic of the growing India-US military cooperation that has intensified in the last four years. 

 When told of the embassy statement on the Nimitz making a landmark visit, Karat said: I think the Americans have been honest about it.

 The government was not ascribing any extraordinary importance to the visit. 

 Port calls by the naval ships of friendly countries is a routine activity to promote goodwill amongst the navies and for exchanging experiences, defence ministry spokesperson Sitanshu Kar said in a statement repeating Antonys position. 

 The statement was issued because CPM leader Sitaram Yechury had demanded an explanation on why the nuclear-powered ship was granted permission to visit Chennai.

 Kar said it is a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and is not known to be carrying weapons with nuclear warheads. 

 Diplomatic sources have also made it clear that the political clearance was done with due consideration. In the past also, nuclear-powered ships/submarines have visited India, said Kar. 

 The ship is so huge it displaces 95,000 tonnes that it is doubtful if any port in India can accommodate it in its berths. The spokesperson said that in Chennai, the Nimitz will be anchored in waters some distance away from the shore.

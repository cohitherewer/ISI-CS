The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Lesson in futility of rebellion

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Feb. 2: In defeat, Raj Thackeray can take comfort and a lesson from history. He joins a long line of Indian political leaders who rebelled against their parties only to be rejected by the people. 

 Some of them like P. Chidambaram, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and Pranab Mukherjee of the Congress or Kalyan Singh of the BJP found political rehabilitation as comeback kids. Others who stayed out like Jagjivan Ram or Morarji Desai in another time and K. Karunakaran, K.R. Gowriamma and Saifuddin Chowdhury in recent years lost out.

 Two things are to be noted about such political rebellions. First, the unimportance of such dissidence and revolt cuts across party lines. Whether it is the party of the Right, the Left or the Centre, dissidence does not pay. Second, all such rebellions are seen by the people and the party faithful as acts of defiance driven by personal ambitions. 

 Although the rebels try to cloak their actions in ideological rhetoric, the people seem to know better. The people may agree with some of their complaints against the parties. But they are rarely convinced that the rebels were right in leaving the flock and that rebellions are the right remedies for the parties problems. In the public eye, the party remains above the leaders. 

 Two things, however, can make things different. If a rebel leader is seen to be the real leader of the party, it is no longer seen as rebellion. This happened when Indira Gandhi rebelled against the old guard of the Congress in 1969. Her personal ambition, no doubt, prompted her action, but she managed to give it an ideological content. To the people and Congressmen alike, she represented the new spirit of the Congress, while men like S. Nijalingappa and K. Kamraj were mere office-bearers, not leaders, of the party. 

 That was not something that someone like S.A. Dange could manage to do. He lost touch with the party he was heading as chairman. Expelled from the CPI, he floated the All India Communist Party, which tried for some time to survive as the Congresss tail and then sank into oblivion. 

 The case of Mamata Banerjee or Sharad Pawar as a rebel presents another category. Their revolts weakened their parent parties, but their subsequent success or failure was linked to their equations with their original friends. 

 Pawar reclaimed his position in Maharashtra and Delhi by re-aligning with the Congress; Mamata harmed both the Congress and herself, rather than the CPM, by staying adrift.

 The other thing that makes rebellions tick is when these are caused, not by personal ambitions, but by real ideological fissures. The many splits in communist parties were thus very different from the rebellion of a Gowriamma or a Saifuddin Chowdhury.

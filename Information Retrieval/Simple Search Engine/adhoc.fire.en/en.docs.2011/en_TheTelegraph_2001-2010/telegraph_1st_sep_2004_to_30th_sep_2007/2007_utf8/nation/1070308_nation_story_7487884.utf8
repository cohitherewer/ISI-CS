 Letter cash probe closed

 New Delhi, March 7 (PTI): The CBI has for want of evidence closed a preliminary inquiry into a mystery envelope sent to finance minister P. Chidambarams office, containing $2,300 and a thank you note.

 Investigations ran into a dead end a year after the envelope was received at Chidambarams office, purportedly sent by a senior official of the central excise department who had been given a two-month extension in service, till March 31, 2006. The CBI stepped in since it involved an official under the ministry, and because he was mentioned as the sender.

 The thank you note was sent for granting permission for extension to the official, who was later questioned. Nothing adverse was found against him, sources said.

 According to the CBI, he had not sought an extension. His service record, too, was described as very clean.

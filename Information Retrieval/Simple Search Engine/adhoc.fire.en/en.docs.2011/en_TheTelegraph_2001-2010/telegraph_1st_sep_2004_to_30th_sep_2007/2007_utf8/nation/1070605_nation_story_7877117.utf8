 Restraint plea to channels

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Priya Ranjan Das Munshi

 New Delhi, June 4: The government has asked TV channels to show restraint in covering the Rajasthan violence.

 The advisory was issued after talks between channel representatives and information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. The meeting took place hours before Gujjar leaders in Rajasthan called off their agitation.

 Das Munshi, known for banning channels, denied suggestions that he was making a veiled threat. I am not advising or dictating. I have no right to dictate. I only appeal to you that I need your help, the minister said.

 NDTV Indias Dibang felt the meeting was a futile exercise, with channels being told not to use terms like Meenas and Gujjars in reports. So what do you use? he asked.

 He admitted that the government had stepped in after some channels showed what they shouldnt have. Still, he felt the media should be free to sort out issues related to content.

 CNN-IBNs Rajdeep Sardesai had no problems with the appeal, as long as it wasnt accompanied by a threat. He made an appeal for self-regulation, which is fine, he added.

 Sardesai felt the coverage of the Gujjar protests has been fair, with no grisly pictures that could be deemed provocative. In any case, one cant help showing visuals.

 After the meeting, Das Munshi fretted before reporters that channels were repeating old scenes of violence and not showing enough of the peace initiatives. 

 Asha Swaroop, secretary in Das Munshis ministry, insisted the talks were held to make an appeal, not threats.

 Doctors back from Britain

 London, Feb. 16 (PTI): An estimated 5,000 Indian doctors have returned home since April and thousands more will leave by August as they have little hope of finding a job in the UK after changes in immigration rules. 

 Raman Lakshman, spokesperson for the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, said: Before 2004-05, about 10,000 doctors from India used to come every year. After the new immigration rules were announced in April 2006, according to a rough estimate, 5,000 doctors might have gone back. There are still more than 10,000 doctors who are affected. 

 Earlier, Indian doctors could apply and get a job in the National Health Service, their biggest employer, after passing the professional and linguistic assessment board test. 

 But under the changed rules, employers have to prove that they had no fitting candidate from the UK and the European Union nations before offering the job to any other candidate.

 Lakshman said there would be more problems after August when the governments modernising medical career process scheme is introduced. Under this centralised scheme, the government had advertised for 21,000 jobs for doctors for which about 30,000 candidates had applied. 

 If the health department applies the new immigration rules, all the jobs will go to the UK and EU citizens and there will be another 9,000 unemployed doctors, Lakshman said, adding that most of them would be Indians who would then have to return home. 

 Lakshman said the association had appealed to the department of health not to apply the discriminatory rules. They are considering it, he said. 

 We believe it is immoral and unfair to do this to Indian and other international doctors already in the UK for some years and committed to life and work here.

 The government changed rules midway for these doctors, causing damage to their lives and careers, he said. 

 There has been an excess of doctors in the UK due to increased training places in medical schools here and a perception that there were many jobs, he said.

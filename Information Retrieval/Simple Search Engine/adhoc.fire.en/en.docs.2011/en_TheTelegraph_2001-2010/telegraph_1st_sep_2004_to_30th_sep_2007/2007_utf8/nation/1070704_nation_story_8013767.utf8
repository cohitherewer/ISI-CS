 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Boomtown ladies reach for stars

 Laptop in one hand, Kaveri Sharma looks like any other professional strutting about infotech-savvy Hyderabad.

 Only an almanac in the other hand suggests she isnt.

 Welcome to the world of tech-savvy lady astrologers who have invaded the technology hotspots and the ritzy malls the citys infotech boom has spawned in recent years.

 Kaveri is one of over 100 such astrologers in the city of nawabs where the neo-rich will splurge to know their future.

 The demand is higher among the IT pros and their parents who opt for foreign grooms or brides, said Anuradha Sharada who zips around the IT hub in her Zen with an Om insignia emblazoned on the rear windscreen.

 While these astrologers apply their minds to a variety of questions, horoscope analyses, dollar dreams and marriage proposals top the list of their assignments.

 My 250 clients need assurances for new projects. The trend is more pronounced among those in the IT industry, where a missed deal can mean a fortune, said Kaveri. 

 On toes for canine guards

 Residents of Garhi in south Delhis East of Kailash locality have decided to sacrifice their sleep to try and catch a bunch of robbers who, confronted by barking dogs, threw acid on the canine guards last week.

 Eleven such dogs many of them mongrels adopted by residents here are recuperating at animal shelters run by Friendicoes, an NGO campaigning for animal rights. 

 They are the best friends. It feels like someone has disfigured a member of the family. Some of us will stay up every night, once the dogs come back, to try and catch the robbers, said Sushmit Agarwal, one of those on duty. 

 The expectation is that the robbers might pass through the locality again. The dogs will surely recognise them. We want to be there to catch the gang then, Agarwal said.

 Guru Kamals biz mantra

 While Rajni calls the shots as Sivaji The Boss, Kamal Hassan is winning rounds of applause outside theatres.

 Last week, he wowed a blue-ribbon conference on retailing with his ideas on how films can be part of the trend.

 According to him, merchandising of films will be big business and actors have a huge role to play in its development. As an example, he picked the way tickets are sold. I have some pet ideas how tickets could be sold. Right now, black-marketers abound, nullifying all the good work. I expect this to change soon, Kamal said.

 His suggestion was that tickets could be sold through a variety of channels, including companies and stores which could use the opportunity to hard-sell their services. Kamals articulate ways floored the audience and guests, including governor S.S. Barnala and retail barons.

 Fast forward

 Work on Delhis flyovers and road-widening plans should hit the fast lane after a big hurdle was removed last week.

 Uttar Pradesh, which shares its border with the capital, has agreed to hand over plots that are in its territory but where Delhi has lined up infrastructure projects.

 Uttar Pradesh will hand over all land where we plan to construct either flyovers or roads, a senior official said. But Uttar Pradesh will have to be paid for the plots, most of them near the Yamuna.

 Among the first projects whose path has been cleared by the land handover are the ITO check post and the Geeta Colony bridge.

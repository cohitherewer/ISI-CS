 Harvard duo junks Oxford

 London, March 4 (PTI): Two Harvard students, one of them a non-resident Indian, have described Oxford University, where they are Rhodes scholars, as outdated and frustrating and dismissed its world famous Bodleian library as less than inspiring.

 The students, whose courses are due to finish this summer, published their comments in a joint article in the Harvard Crimson, a newspaper produced by the Ivy League university.

 Rhodes scholarships were instituted by the 1902 bequest of Cecil Rhodes, the adventurer-magnate who gave his name to Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. They fund 90 American and Commonwealth citizens who study at Oxford every year, and are regarded as among the worlds most notable academic prizes.

 The alumni, referred to as Rhodes, include former US President Bill Clinton, Naomi Wolf, the writer, and Kris Kristofferson, the singer and actor.

 But the glitter has now worn off, according to Melissa Dell, 23, from Oklahoma, and Swati Mylavarapu, also 23, from Florida. In the article published last weekend, they advise Harvard students planning to follow in their footsteps to Oxford to think twice.

 For those of us who have spent time at Oxford on the renowned scholarship, the title bespeaks a frustrating academic experience, they said.

 As enchanting as the universitys ancient spires may seem, Oxfords outdated academic system is far less charming.

 Dell, studying economic and social history at Trinity College, and Mylavarapu, taking the same subject at Wolfson, said the staff spend more time avoiding emails than supervising students.

 They also warned fellow Harvard students that if they have visions of debates with famous Nobel Prize winners, expect instead to be taught in a lecture half by an apathetic post-doc.

 Last weekends article, headlined Oxford Blues, is scornful about the resources available to students at the university.

 The ancient walls of the Bodleian library house a less than inspiring collection, they wrote. You will likely spend most of your time in touch with Harvard librarians accessing materials not available at Oxford.

 Stirrings of a thaw in Siachen silence

 New Delhi, Jan. 12: The army today defied precedent by maintaining an eloquent silence on the Siachen glacier and raised hopes that foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee will strike a positive note in resolving the dispute during his current visit to Pakistan.

 Army chief General Joginder Jaswant Singh was asked at his news conference an annual event in the run-up to Army Day (January 15) for his views on Siachen. He said: Our external affairs minister is on his way to Pakistan. Please await the outcome of his talks with leaders there.

 This was an uncharacteristic statement from army headquarters that has rarely fought shy of speaking its mind on Siachen. The army has consistently maintained even as secretary-level talks were on in the past that Pakistan first has to authenticate the Actual Ground Position Line along the Saltoro ridge that flanks the glacier.

 Last year, as defence secretaries delegations were talking in Islamabad, General Singhs iteration of the army line had riled the Pakistani establishment. It provoked Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri to remark that there were sections in the Indian establishment that were against resolving the dispute.

 But today, General Singh was also reluctant to make statements on Pakistan that can be called hawkish. Usually, the defence establishment is more forthright with its views on the subject and, unlike the external affairs ministry, does not couch opinion in diplomatese.

 The contours of a settlement on Siachen emerged during foreign secretary-level talks in November last year. Pakistan foreign secretary Riaz Mohammad Khan had said that Islamabad was not against authenticating troop positions. But the hopes were not raised so high that New Delhi jumped to grab the opportunity.

 The Indian foreign secretary proposed a three-step plan authentication of ground positions, agreeing on positions to which the troops will withdraw on either side to create a demilitarised zone and a verification regime. The outcome of the talks on the dispute could mean that the two countries have to find a mean between Pakistans package approach and the India step-by-step approach.

 None of this found a mention in the army chiefs news conference. But the army has so long shaped Indian policy on Siachen talks. By choosing not to go public with his views today, the army chief has given the foreign ministers delegation the space to prepare for a dialogue that can end on a positive note.

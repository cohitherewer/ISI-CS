 Mumbai, July 11: On the first anniversary of the attack on Mumbais commuter trains, Maharashtra polices anti-terrorist squad has egg on its face and a fuming home minister gunning for it. 

 At the centre of the controversy is a video CD that contains the confession of a key accused, which was splashed across news channels on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

 The ATS had not submitted the CD as evidence in court. 

 Deputy chief minister R.R. Patil, who addressed a news conference to announce that the CD was not part of the investigation, accused ATS officials of selling it to the media. 

 We have ordered a probe and will find the culprit soon. Whoever has leaked this sensitive CD will not be spared by the government, he said. 

 The ATS top brass dissociated themselves from the leak as department chief K.P. Raghuvanshi rushed to chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukhs office with a list of 10 names who could have leaked it. 

 I have seen the contents of the CD on television. This was certainly not an authorised recording, said Raghuvanshi. 

 State DGP P.S. Pasricha, facing an inquiry for amassing disproportionate property, said: This is shocking. A bad egg can ruin many an important investigation. So I have ordered a departmental inquiry on all the officials of ATS. 

 The new probe comes even as the police remain clueless about the masterminds of the blasts that left 187 dead on July 11 last year. All 13 accused have retracted their statements and alleged torture by the ATS. 

 Police sources said the CD was sold by some officials of the special investigation team probing the serial blasts for Rs 1 lakh. 

 The CD shows accused Mohammad Ali admitting the conspiracy and giving details of the plan.

 Faisal (the facilitator of the blasts) told me he could do anything. He said he still had very good contacts and mentioned the name of Azam Jimma (Azam Cheema, the Lashkar-e-Toiba commander) who was a commander in Pakistan. He said Jimma could get anything done, says Ali on the CD. 

 He claims to have been entrusted with the job of providing lodging for the accused. 

 Faisal said he and his contacts met at Lucky Hotel in Bandra. It was at one such meeting that I met Faisal, Dr Tanveer and Naved. Naved is an educated man who was employed in Hyderabad. Faisal said he was planning an attack in Mumbai and wanted my cooperation. I agreed.

 An eatery famous for its biryani and Afghan food, Lucky is frequented by several Bollywood stars.

 Mumbai, Aug. 26: Worship him, go and watch his films four times if you want, but dont ever hug him, or even shake his hand.

 He is, after all, a convict.

 Maharashtras police constables are learning it the hard way after home minister R.R. Patil ordered a probe into why the cops and jail staff socialised with Sanjay Dutt as the actor emerged from jail last Thursday. 

 The jawan who hugged the actor has already been suspended. Sources in the police say departmental action has been taken against seven jawans. 

 Television footage and pictures that appeared in newspapers showed Sanjay hugging a Pune police jawan and shaking hands with several others as he left Yerwada prison on bail.

 Agencies reported that Patil has ordered Maharashtra police chief P.S. Pasricha to initiate the probe.

 A parallel inquiry is being carried out by inspector general of jails Satish Mathur against some Yerwada officials who allegedly tried to ensure special treatment for Sanjay.

 The Maharashtra Civil Service Conduct rules as well as the police manual forbids policemen and government servants from extending friendly gestures towards convicts. It is seen as a violation of conduct expected of a government servant, said information officer Vasant Titke.

 These people were seen shaking hands and hugging Sanjay Dutt, taking his autograph, etc., which is totally unacceptable. That is why the minister has ordered an inquiry.

 The government wants to know whether the jawans took the initiative of mingling with the actor or whether it was Sanjay who took the first step.

 The move has, however, spawned discontent in the police ranks.

 Why is it that lowly police constables are penalised for such actions while a state cabinet minister like Baba Siddiqui openly flaunts his friendship with Sanjay, accompanies him to courts, receives him when he is out on bail and hugs him as well. A constable can easily get influenced by the actions of ministers, said a top police officer in Pune.

 Siddiqui isnt the only politician to have shown open affection for Sanjay.

 Union information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi had said he would go to jail with a garland when Sanjay is released.

 Top police and jail officials in Maharashtra say such comments by elected representatives make it difficult to instil discipline among the staff.

 Das Munshi had, however, taken care to clarify that the judiciary was doing its job and should be respected.

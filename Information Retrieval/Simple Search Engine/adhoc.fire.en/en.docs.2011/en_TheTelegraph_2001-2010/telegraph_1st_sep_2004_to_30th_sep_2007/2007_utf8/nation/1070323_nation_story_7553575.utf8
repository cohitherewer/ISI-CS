 Bengal land onus on firms 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 22: The Bengal government has decided not to get involved with the process of acquiring land for three iron and steel projects in the pipeline.

 Instead, it has told the prospective investors to buy land on their own a move the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government hopes will insulate it from backlashes like the one in Nandigram.

 Weve decided we will not take the onus of acquiring land on ourselves. We think local resistance will be less if investors buy land on their own, said an official of the commerce and industry department.

 Officials today told representatives of Bhushan Steel and the Maharashtra-based Abhijeet Group they would have to acquire the land.

 The officials said the idea originated from the Salboni model Sajjan Jindal has said he would buy 500 acres directly from land owners, while the government would lease out 4,500 acres.

 Bhushan Steel wants 2,000 acres for a 3-million-tonne steel plant at Salanpur near Asansol, while the Abhijeet Group needs 1,200 acres in Burdwan for a 2-million-tonne steel plant and a power project.

 The Burdwan district magistrate has been asked to identify land in the area for the Bhushan plant. However, according to our assessment, it will not be more than 10 per cent of Bhushans total requirement. The company will have to buy the rest, said the official.

 Earlier, the government had told the Balaji Group it would acquire the land the company needs at Raghunathpur in Purulia to set up a steel plant, a cement factory and a power plant. The group will need 4,000 acres for the projects. Now, the government is planing to ask the group to acquire the land.

 Officials said there should not be any problem in acquiring land at these sites as they do not have much agricultural significance, but the governments involvement may not be acceptable in the wake of the anti-acquisition movement. 

 Following the Nandigram fiasco, the CPM has decided to put on the backburner all plans other than the Tata small-car project in Singur and the Jindal plant in Salboni until the land acquisition issue is resolved. These include projects proposed by the Indonesian Salim Group.

 On land acquisition for the Salim Group, commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said: We cant begin these projects until we have carried out a consensus-building exercise locally. We dont know when we will be able to start the acquisition process.

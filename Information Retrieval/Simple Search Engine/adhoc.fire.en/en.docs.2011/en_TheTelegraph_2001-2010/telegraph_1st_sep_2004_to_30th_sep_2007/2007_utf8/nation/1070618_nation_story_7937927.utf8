 Centre works on Davy deal 

 New Delhi, June 17 (PTI): The foreign ministry is in the process of sending a note verbale to Denmark seeking extradition of Kim Davy, a key accused in the 1995 Purulia armsdrop case.

 The note includes an assurance that he will be repatriated to that country to serve any prison term following his possible conviction in India. 

 Relenting to pressure from Danish authorities, New Delhi will give an executive assurance to Copenhagen that Davy will not be sentenced to death for any offence in India and that he will be repatriated to Denmark to serve any prison sentence after his trial, official sources said today. 

 The note was cleared by the Union cabinet in April and sent to the foreign ministry. 

 During the night of December 17-18, 1995, an An-26 aircraft flew over Purulia in Bengal and dropped a huge cache of assault rifles and ammunition near the Anand Margs headquarters at Anandnagar. 

 The aircrafts Latvian crew and British national Peter Bleach were arrested at Mumbai airport four days later. Davy managed to escape and was later traced to Denmark. 

 The CBI located Davy, a Danish citizen, and sent an extradition request. 

 The Danish authorities responded by laying down seven conditions for New Delhi, including one that Davy would serve any prison term in Denmark. 

 After an initial negative reaction, the CBI and the Centre agreed to the conditions.

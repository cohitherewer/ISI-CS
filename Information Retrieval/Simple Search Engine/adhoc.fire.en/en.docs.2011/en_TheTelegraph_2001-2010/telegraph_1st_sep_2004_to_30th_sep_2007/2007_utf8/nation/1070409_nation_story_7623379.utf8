 Death on AMU campus

 - Student caught in crossfire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, April 8: A student of Aligarh Muslim University who was caught in a crossfire last night between two rival groups died this morning as campus violence engulfed another old seat of learning in Uttar Pradesh.

 Aligarh senior superintendent of police Akhil Kumar said Mohammad Saquib was returning from the university library when a stray bullet hit him. The B.Com student was taken to hospital where he died.

 The violence and continuing differences with students forced vice-chancellor Naseem Ahmad to step down this evening.

 AMU officials said Ahmad, an IAS officer from the Haryana cadre, had been under pressure following a face-off with students union leaders on issues related to dates of examinations and attendance. Professor Saleemuddin, the pro-vice-chancellor, has taken over as acting vice-chancellor. 

 Police said last nights shootout in AMU was a result of a scuffle in the afternoon between members of two rival groups. One student was assaulted. But Saquib, they confirmed, was innocent. Sources said a hunt is on to arrest two rival student leaders who were fighting with weapons on the campus.

 Last year, Lucknow University had to be closed after authorities cracked down on rogue students in a drive to purge the campus of criminal elements.

 Before that, on July 20, 2006, student leader Upendra Singh, chargesheeted in 10 criminal cases, was shot dead from point-blank range in one of the hostels of the 86-year-old institution. Another student was critically injured. In October 2004, Manish Rai, a student of mass communication, was killed in an exchange of fire between two rival groups. 

 Today, AMU students went on the rampage as news of Saquibs death spread. 

 Students union president Nafis Ali, who is leading an agitation on the campus, alleged that some officials of the nearly 90-year-old university were responsible for the rise of student violence.

 Pune goes wi-fi

 Pune, April 2 (PTI): Consolidating its position as an emerging IT hub, Pune is on the way to becoming the first city in the country to be wire-free Internet-enabled.

 The first phase of the Unwire Pune project launched today with the deployment of wi-fi technology will enable people to access the Net without cables within a 20-sq-km area.

 The Pune Municipal Corporation, in association with global chip-maker Intel Corporation and Chennai-based wi-fi service provider Microsense, launched the first phase.

 The project was inaugurated by Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar. 

 The minister said it would help create 1.25 lakh jobs in information technology in a year and would bring huge benefits to people from all walks of life.

 Intel (South Asia) managing director R. Sivakumar said the project is part of his companys programme to take computing to one billion people across the world. 

 He added that cities like Bangalore, Mysore and Ahmedabad are also keen on unwiring.

 Meerut erupts over ICU rape 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, July 9: The alleged gang rape of a nursing home patient by two ward boys in the intensive care unit has put Meerut on the boil.

 On the night of July 7, the ward boys of M Prakash Nursing Home allegedly sedated a 19-year-old girl, tied her hands and legs as she slipped into semi-consciousness, and then took turns to rape her. A third employee allegedly kept watch outside.

 The girl, an asthma patient, was admitted on July 6 with breathing problems, police said. 

 She was wheeled into the ICU straightaway.

 When her parents came to meet her yesterday afternoon, the girl disclosed the incident after which protesters ransacked the nursing home in the Bachcha Park area last night. 

 Traders in the western Uttar Pradesh town also put up roadblocks and in several places smashed vehicles. 

 Meerut inspector-general B.K. Gupta said three persons have been arrested. The victim, a first-year undergraduate student, identified two of them as the prime accused, he said. Their names are Manoj and Devender. The third person arrested was the one keeping watch.

 The girls father said it was criminal on the part of the nursing home to leave a patient in the care of ward boys. We were shocked to know that there were no nurses on duty during the night, he said. 

 The girl was later admitted to Dufferin hospital and a medical examination was conducted. 

 The results are yet to come in, a source said.

 The police have sealed M Prakash Nursing Home and set up a committee of three government doctors to probe the administrative lapses that could have led to the incident. This, however, has failed to stop the protests. 

 A traders association, along with students and other residents wore black badges and held demonstrations, bringing traffic to a halt. Please do justice, chief minister, their placards said.

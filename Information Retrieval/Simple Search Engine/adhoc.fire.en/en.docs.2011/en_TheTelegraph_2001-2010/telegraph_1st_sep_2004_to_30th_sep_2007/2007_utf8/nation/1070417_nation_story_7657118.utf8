 Husband accused of car rape attempt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, April 16: Rashmi had just left her workplace, a call centre in Gurgaon, around 2 this morning and settled down to a quiet nap in her husbands car when the uncomfortable prods started.

 Soon, Rashmi (name changed) felt hands probing her sleeping body, and the 25-year-old mother of one realised she was being raped by none other than her husband and his friend in the moving car. 

 Rashmis husband Kamal, also a call centre employee, and his friend Saurav Kataria were arrested this morning after a brief chase.

 Kamal and Saurav vehemently denied Rashmis charge that they had attempted to rape her in the car on her way home from work. 

 She also accused her brother-in-law of threatening her with dire consequences if she approached police, agencies said.

 We have booked the two accused under the charge of attempted rape. According to the girl, they dropped her off on Mehrauli-Gurgaon road after she fought them off, deputy commissioner of police (south Delhi) Anil Shukla said. 

 The police, however, believe the woman may be overplaying the matter to get back at her husband. 

 That possibility cannot be ruled out as the couple has a brief but bitter history of marital arguments, a senior police official said. 

 According to the police, the couple had eloped and married against the wishes of their families two years ago. 

 They have a one-year-old child, the officer said. We have spoken to the neighbours of the couple, and we are told they have had a history of bitter, loud bickering.

 The girl, with wounds on her arms and legs, has been admitted to the trauma centre of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

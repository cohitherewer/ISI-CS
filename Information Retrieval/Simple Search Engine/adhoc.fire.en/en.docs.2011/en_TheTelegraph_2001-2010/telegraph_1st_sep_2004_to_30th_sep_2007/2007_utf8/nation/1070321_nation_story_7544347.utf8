 New Delhi, March 20: Dhananjay Madan is no stranger to adventure hes cycled from hometown Mumbai to Kanyakumari and scaled Himalayan peaks. But the current adrenaline rush tops it all for the 48-year-old corporate executive. 

 The quality control analyst at Reliance is one of nine executives and students all self-confessed adventure addicts on a unique journey of peace and friendship that will take them from Mumbai to Islamabad. 

 Weve all known each other for several years. We go cycling, trekking, mountaineering, but weve never seen ourselves as peace activists, confessed Dhananjay, team leader and the oldest of the nine. 

 The group, which started from Panvel on the outskirts of Mumbai on March 1, plans to reach Islamabad on April 1, cycling 80 to 100 km a day on an average. 

 Passing through Agra today, they will cross Delhi on Friday. 

 The youngest, 21-year-old Neeraj Ghate, is an engineering student at a college in Navi Mumbais Vashi. Cycling by his side a lot of the time is his senior in college by one year, Kaustabh Gujare. 

 On their way, the group crossed Malegaon, still recovering from last years blasts that snuffed out 38 lives. 

 Some hundred-odd locals there came up to us and started asking us what we were doing. When we explained, they requested us to address schoolchildren the next day. The experience in Malegaon was out of this world, said 30-year-old Rupali Nehate, who on more mundane days dons the cap of product manager at a software firm. 

 Eating at dhabas for the past 20 days, Rupali says she misses home-cooked food. 

 But the cause is so great. We really want to help change negative perceptions in the minds of both Indians and Pakistanis. 

 And sometimes locals invite us to stay the night with them. We then get to gorge on home food, she laughed on the phone, taking a brief break from the cycling. 

 The response from locals had been outstanding, said Dhananjay. Weve had no negative experiences from people. 

 They have had their share of problems, though. Shraddha, the only other girl in the team, fell off her bike yesterday, injuring herself. 

 She was sent in a hired car to Delhi, where she is resting with friends. She will join us in Delhi, said Dhananjay. 

 They will cross Panipat the site of the recent blasts on the Samjhauata Express. Terrorists will try to disrupt Indo-Pak relations through such attacks. Ordinary citizens like us have to show them they wont succeed, said Rupali. 

 Crossing the Wagah border, the group plans to pass Lahore on their way to Islamabad. 

 The team has a gift for Pakistani executives and students they hope to meet a card gifted to the cyclists by a two-year-old and her mother when they were being flagged off in Mumbai.

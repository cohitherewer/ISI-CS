 Fishermen face Lanka bombs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, June 17: Four Rameshwaram fishermen were injured when Sri Lankans, angry at their presence close to the maritime boundary, hurled crude bombs at them.

 The incident took place last night in Pesalai, near Dhanushkoti, sources said. 

 According to a senior police official in Rameshwaram, the bombs blew the fishermens boat to pieces, forcing them to jump into the sea. 

 Other Tamil Nadu fishermen helped them get to shore today. One of the four who was injured is in the government hospital at Ramanathapuram. 

 About 784 fishing boats had set sail on Saturday.

 Fishing in Pesalai, close to the Sri Lankan waters, is always dangerous. The Lankan fishermen were furious after the group allegedly strayed into their side of the border.

 Before the bombs were thrown, there was an altercation between the two groups, after which the Lankan fishermen allegedly snatched the food packets being carried by those from Tamil Nadu, the sources said.

 Until the fishermen returned home today, Rameshwaram was gripped by fear that 12 fishermen had been kidnapped by a gang of fishermen from Sri Lanka. 

 Recently, 11 Tamil Nadu fishermen were abducted by the Tamil Tigers and were released after being kept in camps in Lanka for over 70 days.

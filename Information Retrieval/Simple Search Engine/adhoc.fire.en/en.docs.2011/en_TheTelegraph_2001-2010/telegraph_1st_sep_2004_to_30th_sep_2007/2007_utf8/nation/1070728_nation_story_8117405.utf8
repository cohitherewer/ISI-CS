 Walkout option

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 27: India will walk out of the nuclear deal with the US on six months notice if it wants to conduct another nuclear test, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has told the BJP.

 At the same briefing here yesterday, atomic energy chief Anil Kakodkar said that despite the promised separation between the military and civilian facilities, the people working on the two sides of the divide could be the same.

 Our personnel will move as we want them to, Kakodkar said. National security adviser M.K. Narayanan kept absolutely quiet at Kakodkars comments. 

 The BJP leaders said they would reserve their judgement till they had seen the text. Former foreign minister Jaswant Singh said the party was concerned that the gains of 1998, that is a strategic autonomy for India, must not be compromised. Jaswant had negotiated a strategic dialogue with former US deputy secretary of state Strobe Talbott after the 1998 nuclear tests.

 If India was now going to dedicate a safeguarded facility to reprocess spent fuel, which would be open to International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors, then such intrusive IAEA inspection in our nuclear programme is going to be very troublesome, Jaswant said.

 But Narayanan told the BJP that the deal wouldnt dent Indias strategic autonomy in any way. All the decisions will remain ours, he said.

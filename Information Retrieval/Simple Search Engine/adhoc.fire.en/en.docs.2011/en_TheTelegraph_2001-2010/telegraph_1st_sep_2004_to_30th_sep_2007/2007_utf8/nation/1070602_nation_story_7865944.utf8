 New Delhi, June 1: Twirling his luxuriant moustache, Brahmsingh Gujjar looks straight in the eye of each person approaching the barricade, flags him down with a tree trunk and asks him point-blank: Gujjar hai (Are you a Gujjar)? 

 If the answer is in the negative, his tone not the warmest to start with stiffens further. 

 Meena hai?

 Five persons were killed in Rajasthan today in clashes between the Gujjars and the Meenas communities with a history of combat dating back to the 11th century. 

 The Meenas, who believe they are descendants of the fish avatar of Lord Vishnu, ruled much of todays Rajasthan between the eighth and 11th centuries, according to historians.

 The Gujjars, who came from central Asia, are believed to have assisted the Rajputs in defeating the Meena kings and establishing the state of Rajputana, says Joginder Singh, a professor in the history department of Rajasthan University.

 Brahmsingh has been on vigil on the Jaipur-Agra highway, some 50 km from Dausa, with his self-made club since Tuesdays police firing.

 The conflict is over reservation. The Gujjar leadership is accusing the Meenas, who dominate administrative and police posts in the current government, of lobbying hard to ensure they dont gain Scheduled Tribe status. 

 The Meenas, beneficiaries of the ST status since Independence, are today one of the most dominant social communities in Rajasthan.

 If we are given ST status, the Meenas will have to compete for government jobs and seats in educational institutions, alleges Mandata Singh, the right-hand man of Gujjar chieftain Kirori Singh Baisna.

 Adding another spin to the conspiracy theory, Rajasthan police sources today confirmed an allegation the Gujjars had been making that one of the three policemen shot dead in the police firing was from their community. 

 Our internal investigations into the firing are still not complete, but it is true that one of the three constables who died was a Gujjar, a senior officer said. 

 The Gujjars claim that the additional superintendent of police, a Meena, who allegedly ordered the firing, turned his gun on the Gujjar constable after the latter refused to fire on the mob. 

 The sources said the investigations thus far havent ruled out the possibility of the allegations being true.

 Leaders of the Meena community, however, argue that the Gujjars, by blocking roads and threatening violence, are trying to intimidate them.

 And if the Gujjars think they can recreate history, they are mistaken, warns Avtar Singh Meena, a prominent Meena leader in Rajasthan.

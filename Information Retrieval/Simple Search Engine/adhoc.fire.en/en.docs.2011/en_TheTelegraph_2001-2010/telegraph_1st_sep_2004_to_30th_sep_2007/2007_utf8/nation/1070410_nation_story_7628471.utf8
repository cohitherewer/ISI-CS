 Apang loses crown

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Itanagar, April 9: Gegong Apang today became the second Congress chief minister of a northeastern state to be unseated in as many months after an intrigue-filled game of political musical chairs. 

 As in Meghalaya, where J.D. Rymbai lost majority support and made way for D.D. Lapang in March, Apangs ouster was the culmination of an orchestrated revolt in the Congress in Arunachal Pradesh. The difference lay in the fact that Apang was done in by someone he probably never considered to be a challenger. 

 Dorjee Khandu, 52, was sworn in chief minister after Apang proposed his name at the Congress Legislature Party meeting in Itanagar this afternoon. Not that the wily veteran, who reigned for 30 months, had a choice. 

 The writing was on the wall when Takam Sanjay, political adviser to Apang, resigned on Saturday night and declared to all and sundry that the ousted chief minister was not heeding his advice to quit gracefully.

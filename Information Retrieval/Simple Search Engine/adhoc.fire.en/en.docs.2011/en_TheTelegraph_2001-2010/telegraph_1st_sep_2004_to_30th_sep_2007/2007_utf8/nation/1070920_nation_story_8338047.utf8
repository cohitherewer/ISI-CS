 Shame on cops-to-be

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: A dozen aspiring police constables allegedly tried to molest some college students and then returned today to blame the girls for dressing provocatively and lecture them on womens maryada.

 The incident sparked protests across the Delhi University campus.

 Police said they were probing the incident, but no arrests have been made yet.

 According to the victims all from the Northeast the men targeted them as they travelled by a cycle-rickshaw yesterday in Mukherjee Nagar, which adjoins the university campus.

 One of them, a girl from Manipur, said the men, who are appearing for an exam to become constables, tried to pull them off the rickshaw. I was sitting in the middle. But a friend, who was sitting at the edge of the seat, almost fell. They were passing lewd comments and making disgusting noises, she said.

 The girls later went to Mukherjee Nagar police station, but said the police initially did not register a case and instead asked horrible questions.

 This evening, the station house officer and two head constables were suspended for not taking appropriate action, PTI reported.

 A dozen of the wannabe constables arrived at the college this morning and started seeking out the girls. But they ran into angry students, who said they would teach them a lesson. 

 They were standing in our college and telling us that if we wanted to prevent getting harassed, we should stop dressing provocatively,), said Swastika Mishra, a student of Indraprastha College.

 In the afternoon, girls from the college went to meet the vice-chancellor but VC Deepak Pental was in a meeting.

 The girls then marched to the police headquarters seeking a change in the venue of the police exam from the Delhi Police Parade Grounds, adjacent to the university campus.

 We are trying to identify the men alleged to have been involved, said deputy commissioner (north) Devesh Srivastava.

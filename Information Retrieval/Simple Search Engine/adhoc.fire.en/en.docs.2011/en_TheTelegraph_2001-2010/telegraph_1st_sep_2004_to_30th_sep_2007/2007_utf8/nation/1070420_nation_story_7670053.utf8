 Party on, not for everyone

 Mumbai, April 19: The night was young and stayed so till the sun played party-pooper. 

 The half-hour sangeet ceremony, which began at 10 last night, went on till five this morning at Prateeksha. No wonder, the day started a tad late for the groggy-eyed revellers. 

 Heres the paparazzi diary on Day Two, when the mehendi was held in Ashs flat, La Mer in Bandra.

 10.42 am: Bonsais make their way inside La Mer. The mehendi that will adorn Ashs manicured palms has supposedly been sent by mother-in-law Jaya Bachchan, who ordered it from Sojat in Rajasthan. 

 1.27 pm: There is a buzz outside Jalsa, where more celebrations are in store in the evening. The decorations scream out loud that its getting ready for a big mehendi night. 

 But the wedding bells have brought bad news for Munna, a bookseller at the crossing outside Jalsa. Arey is shaadi ke liye gari zyaada der rukne nahin de rahein hai, he grumbles. With the cars not being stuck at the traffic signal, his business has come to a halt.

 4.15 pm: Prateeksha seems to be a party veteran. Quickly recovering from last nights hangover, it is now raring to go. And its got a new look, with fresh flowers strung around the gate.

 That doesnt impress Uma Shankar Gupta, though. The auto-rickshaw driver, who hails from the Bachchans home state Uttar Pradesh, asks: Aise shaadion se hi kya garibi hatayenge is desh mein (Can we remove poverty from our country with such weddings)?

 Take that.

 Back to dance floor

 Back from Aishwaryas house, Abhisheks gang of friends got into their dancing shoes again, at Jalsa. The wedding mood has to be maintained between the sangeet and the marriage, said one of them.

 Pakistani singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, nephew of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, was the star performer. 

 But this time Amitabh and Jaya, who had waltzed to Kabhie Kabhie last night, stuck to only watching the youngsters have a blast. And a blast they sure had, swinging to Amitabhs old hits like Dekha na hayre and Rang barse.

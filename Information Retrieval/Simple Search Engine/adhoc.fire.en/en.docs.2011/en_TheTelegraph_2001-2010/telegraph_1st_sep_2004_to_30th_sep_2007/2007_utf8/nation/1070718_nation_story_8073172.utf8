 Bhopal, July 17: Showbiz beckons Monica Bedi but it may be a while before she responds to lights, camera and action.

 The actress, acquitted yesterday in a passport forgery case here, said she had got a few offers to begin a second innings. Her family, however, was less than lukewarm to the idea. 

 Director-producer Guddu Dhanoa in Mumbai confirmed Monicas claim. Yes, I have a special role and script for her, he said. 

 But Monicas uncle Purshottam Bedi did not like the idea much. 

 Her father Prem (in Norway) is also reaching Hyderabad. We will decide the next course of action after securing her release, he said. Doing films should not be a priority for her now.

 Purshottam will also go to Hyderabad, where Monica has already been granted bail in another passport forgery case.

 The Bedis have reasons to be cold to Monicas possible return to Bollywood. 

 In 1992, when Monica went to England from Norway to study English, she met film actor-producer Manoj Kumar her first brush with Bollywood. 

 It was, however, during her second movie that the starlet saw the ugly side of tinsel town when her film producer was killed allegedly by the underworld, shortly after Gulshan Kumars murder.

 Next, her parents and uncle saw Monica making frequent trips to the UAE. Then she vanished and was caught in Lisbon in the company of Bombay blast accused Abu Salem.

 Monica today declined comment on companion Salem.

 She conceded that the acquittal came as a surprise, so I really do not have much plans for the future. 

 Thanking her parents, she said: Had they not supported me, perhaps I would have committed suicide.

 The starlet has gathered quite a few fans among co-inmates in the Bhopal jail after she taught them dance, yoga and English. 

 Tonight, the inmates have organised a special farewell for their real heroine, with permission from the jail authorities. 

 Bhopal jail staff said it was rare for inmates to organise a farewell. 

 In the days preceding the verdict, Monica kept praying, alternating between reading the Bible and doing puja, till magistrate Ajay Srivastva pronounced her not guilty.

 She said claims that she was secretly filmed in the jail was absurd, though her own lawyer had levelled it.

 A Hyderabad police team will take her away tomorrow. Monica faces a three-year sentence in Hyderabad but has got bail.

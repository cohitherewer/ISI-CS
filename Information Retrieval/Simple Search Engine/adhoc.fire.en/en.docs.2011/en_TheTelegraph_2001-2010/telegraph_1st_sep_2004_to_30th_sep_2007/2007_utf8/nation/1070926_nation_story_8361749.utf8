 Dynasty? Not if Rajnath son is in charge 

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY AND SANJAY K. JHA

 Rajnath Singh

 Lucknow/New Delhi, Sept. 25: The BJP has put Rajnath Singhs son in charge of its Uttar Pradesh youth wing a day after one of its leaders scoffed at Rahul Gandhis rise in the Congress as dynastic rule.

 Pankaj Singh, 30, is the new president of the state Akhil Bharatiya Yuva Morcha. Yesterday, Rahul was appointed Congress general secretary in charge of the Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India.

 State BJP chief R.R. Tripathi said Pankaj, who hasnt held any party post before, was inducted on the basis of his political vision.

 He will definitely re-energise the state youth wing, said Tripathi, a Rajnath loyalist promoted to his current post a fortnight ago.

 Many party leaders, however, cited how Pankaj had run away when he was offered the party ticket from Chiraigaon in Varanasi before the April-May Assembly elections.

 He was feeling extremely insecure and expressed his reluctance, a senior leader said.

 The induction of Pankaj was done without any mention of it in the BJPs national circles, betraying a desire to keep the appointment low-key.

 Dynasty is a key BJP plank against the Congress. Although the BJP has so far not commented officially on Rahuls elevation, M. Venkaiah Naidu had yesterday mentioned the D-word.

 Sources close to Rajnath said Pankajs appointment could not be compared to Rahuls, since he was making a humble beginning as state youth wing chief.

 There were demands from some quarters to make him the national youth wing chief but Rajnathji didnt do that. In fact, he had no role in the appointment, a leader said.

 The sources claimed Pankaj had backed out of the state polls because of discouraging feedback from the constituency.

 Pankaj, a management graduate, was noticed during Rajnaths rathyatra last year and later the party grapevine was abuzz with stories of his political ambitions. He sounded excited today.

 My priority would be to rebuild the youth and students wings and contribute to the partys organisational strength, he said over the phone from Varanasi.

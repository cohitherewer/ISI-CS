 More Saudi than Indian

 Bangalore, July 6: Kafeel and Sabeel Ahmed, the puritanical Bangalore brothers accused of involvement in the failed London and Glasgow bombings, had hardly spent a decade of their lives in India, sources said today. Both spent their formative years in Saudi Arabia.

 Their parents, Dr Zakia and Dr Maqbool Ahmed, lived in Iran from 1979 to 1983, a period when their sons were born. Zakia did travel to India for childbirth on each occasion, though.

 Later, in the middle of the Iran-Iraq war, the family left for Saudi Arabia and stayed there a further 11 years till 1994. When they returned to Bangalore, Kafeel and Sabeel would have been 14 and 13.

 Kafeel left for the UK just seven years later, in 2001, and Sabeel followed him a couple of years on.

 Zakia and her daughter Sadia, an MBBS student, were secretly questioned outside their home today by a Research amp; Analysis Wing (RAW) team that arrived in the city this morning.

 They were asked if they knew that the brothers were planning attacks in the UK, if they followed the hardline sect Tabliqui Jamat, and when the brothers had turned radical, a source said.

 The sleuths also interrogated the mother and siblings of Mohammed Haneef, the Indian doctor detained in Australia. Tomorrow, they are expected to speak to Haneefs wife Firdous, who is staying with her parents.

 The move comes after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday offered to help the British government as well as the three suspects families in Bangalore.

 Sources said the agency has been asked to pass on all information to the Prime Ministers Office. Delhi hasnt decided about extending consular support to the accused.

 The city police had questioned the Ahmeds last night and this morning at their home. Immediately after that, the familys lawyer, B.T. Venkatesh, left the house with Zakia, Sadia and a relative.

 Venkatesh told the waiting journalists the family was headed to a relatives house. But sources later said the lawyer drove Zakia and Sadia to a guesthouse where the RAW team questioned them for over four hours.

 The police confirmed that Kafeel had told his parents last week he would not be in touch for some time because he had an important project. He said his last presentation had failed a probable hint at the thwarted London bombings.

 Doctors questioned

 Australian police today said another five Indian doctors with experience in the British health system had been questioned in the case and four had been released, an AP report said. But one of them is still under investigation, federal police chief Mick Keelty said.

 The remand of Haneef, being questioned since Monday after his detention from Brisbane, was yesterday extended till Monday. His Indian colleague, Mohammed Asif Ali, was also questioned but freed at the end of it yesterday.

 Of the five doctors questioned today, four are from Perth and Kalgoorlie in Western Australia and one from Sydney. The police seized computer files and other material from two hospitals in Western Australia.

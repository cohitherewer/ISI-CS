 Gorakhpur train on fire

 Gorakhpur, Jan. 31 (PTI): Rioters set a train on fire, tried to burn another and torched several vehicles as the curfew-hit town remained in the grip of violence that flared earlier this week over the arrest of a local BJP MP.

 As paramilitary forces staged a flag march, Uttar Pradesh home secretary A.K. Sinha said violence was also reported from areas adjoining Gorakhpur.

 Police said the Gorakhpur-Gonda passenger train was set on fire in Balrampur district late last night. However, there were no casualties. Hindu Yuva Vahini activists allegedly set on fire an ambulance and tried to burn the Godan Express at Mau.

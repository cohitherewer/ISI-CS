 Exodus headache for army

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 29: More than 2,000 officers opted to leave the armed forces prematurely in the last three years for reasons as diverse as being superseded for promotion to more lucrative offers from the corporate sector, defence minister A.K. Antony has said.

 More than a thousand scientists have quit defence research in the last five years to join the private sector, the minister said in a written reply to Parliament. 

 More than half the number of officers who left the armed forces is from the army 1,119 officers left the force between 2004 and 2006. There were 600 other officers who also wanted to quit the army but were denied permission. A total of 3,060 officers offered to quit the army, navy and the air force in the last three years.

 Among soldiers other than officers, a total of 27,865 personnel took premature retirement. Expectedly, a bulk is from the 1.1-million-strong army, which is also facing a shortage of officers.

 But the sharp rise in the number of air force personnel from 371 in 2004 to 1,222 in 2006 is notable. It coincides with the growth of the private sector in civil aviation.

 The lure of the private sector is most prominent in the Defence Research and Development Organisation. In a separate reply, Antony said 1,007 scientists have left the DRDO for private sector jobs between 2002 and 2007.

 The rate of attrition is marginally higher compared to private sector industries. There has been no substantial impact of such attrition on completion of DRDO projects, the minister said.

 He said the DRDO has submitted proposals to increase salaries of its scientists to the Sixth Pay Commission and arrest exodus.

 The statistics reveal that the air headquarters clampdown on its officers wanting to quit has paid dividends. The number of officers discharged from the IAF has been brought down from 238 to 80 between 2004 and 2005.

 Antony said that to check the exodus, the government was allowing time-bound promotion to the colonel (and equivalent) rank. The choice to leave and the permission to leave were granted not only because of better opportunities but also on compassionate grounds or because some officers were placed in permanently low medical category.

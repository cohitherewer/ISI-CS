 AIIMS crisis deepens

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: Director P. Venugopal today walked out of a meeting of the AIIMS governing body after some of his aides were prevented from participating, raising the tempo in his battle with the health minister. 

 Venugopal arrived at the health ministry headquarters the venue of the meeting with a team of 15 senior faculty members who have been backing him against Anbumani Ramadoss. 

 The director insisted they too be allowed in. When securitymen said only governing body members would be allowed, he walked away. 

 The governing body passed a resolution asking Venugopal to explain his actions. A faculty member close to the director said he would only explain himself before court. 

 A senior ministry officials response was cryptic. If he thinks he is God, he is soon going to see what it is like to be a mortal.

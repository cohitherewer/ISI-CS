The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Council revived after 22 years

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, April 8: The Andhra Pradesh legislative council has been reconstituted after a lapse of 22 years.

 The House began functioning last week with its senior-most legislator, P. Nageswar Rao, as the pro-tem chairman. The CPI leader had taken oath at Raj Bhavan earlier.

 Telugu Desam Party president N. Chandrababu Naidu boycotted the inaugural as his party has been opposed to the revival of the council. 

 However, several senior TDP leaders were in attendance, five of whom took oath of office.

 The council had been dissolved in 1985 by the then TDP government led by N.T. Rama Rao. 

 Unhappy with the House repeatedly questioning his populist measures, NTR had been whetting the axe for some time. 

 Matters came to a head when the council moved a privilege motion against the TDPs mentor and chief editor of Telugu daily Eenadu, Ramoji Rao.The privilege action followed a scathing article Eenadu had carried on a stormy session of the House.

 It prompted NTR to get a resolution passed in the House for dissolving the legislative council.

 When the Congress came to power in the state, it tried to revive the council in 1990 but could not get the move through Parliament, then dominated by the National Front combine of Opposition parties.

 In 2004, when the Congress returned to form the government under Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, it moved a fresh resolution for the councils revival. It was passed in Parliament in 2005 and the President gave his assent in January 2006.

 The pro-tem chairman last week administered the oath of secrecy to 63 members, who included graduates, teachers, MLAs and those nominated by the governor.

 The results for 31 seats for candidates from local authorities have been withheld after allegations that the ruling Congress had asked for ballot papers to be shown to prevent cross-voting. 

 The matter is being jointly investigated by the chief electoral officers of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

 A. Chakrapani, who was deputy chairman of the council when it was dissolved, is likely to become the first chairman of the revived House. 

 The 63-year-old Chakrapani hails from Kurnool district and is a law graduate from Nagpur University. He became a member of the legislative council in 1976 and was made chief whip and then a deputy chairman.

 The current session of the legislative council is expected to continue till tomorrow.

 Eight states had preferred bicameral legislatures when the Legislative Council Act was passed by Parliament in 1957. But only two continue to have the council, apart from Andhra.

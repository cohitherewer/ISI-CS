 Calcutta, June 26: India is all set to become the first country outside Europe to host IfraExpo, a long-running show on global newspaper printing and publishing.

 Established in 1961, Ifra is an association for newspapers and media worldwide and includes services such as research, publications, standardisation, conference and training, exhibitions and advisory services.

 IfraExpo India 2007 will be held from September 4 to 6 at the Chennai Trade Centre, Chennai.

 Recognising the growing potential of newspaper business in the country, India was chosen as the first favoured destination for the first ever IfraExpo outside Europe, said R.V. Rajan, managing director, Ifra India, in town to spread the word.

 The key attraction at IfraExpo India 2007 will be the Newsroom of the Future, a demonstration of Ifras concept of a multimedia newsroom.

 The expo will coincide with the 15th annual Ifra India 2007 conference, which will have speakers from India and abroad discussing developments in the publishing business and newspaper printing technology. Strategies to get the younger generation to read newspapers will also be discussed.

 New media is affecting newspapers all over the world. The average annual decline of sales is about five to 10 per cent. In India and China the newspaper business is booming, but the threat remains, so we will have speakers address the issue, said Rajan.

 A special attraction at IfraExpo India will be a pavilion on 400 years of the history of newspaper printing.

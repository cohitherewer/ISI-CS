 Knot tied, the Saathiya way

 ANANYA SENGUPTA 

 A still from Saathiya

 Mumbai, April 20: This is one love story that would make Abhishek Bachchans buddy Shaad Ali mighty pleased.

 While the filmmaker is busy dancing at his friends baraat, Rachna and Sahil are bringing his Saathiya characters to life.

 Hours before Abhishek and Aishwarya were set to tie the knot, Rachna and Sahil were spotted running out of a Bandra temple, garlands hanging from their necks a scene reminiscent of Shaads debut film.

 In Saathiya, Suhani and Aditya ironically played by Ashs ex-flame Viveik Oberoi and Rani Mukerji, rumoured to have had an affair with Abhishek had married in a temple without the consent of their families.

 Rachna, 20, and Sahil, 24, met at a common friends place, unlike the Saathiya couple who fell in love on a local train. 

 But while their lives since then took a track similar to the film, the contrast with the real-life romance of AbAsh is stark.

 No doting father-in-law or parties galore with friends and family here. Ten days after they met, Sahil proposed to Rachna. When her parents got a whiff of the affair, all hell broke loose. 

 We had to fight my parents every day since then. It was so stressful. Then they tried to fix my wedding with someone else. That left us with no option but to get married without telling them, said Rachna, a smile hiding the months of agony. 

 Demure and draped in an olive green sari, the 20-year-old blushed as she recalled her one-and-a-half-year romance. 

 I always dreamt of a nice wedding. Anyway, we couldnt afford a lavish marriage, so it was out of the question. But yes, I wish my parents were here, she said.

 Sahil and Rachna share their wedding day with the hottest couple in Bollywood, but their wedding was as low-key as the other was high-profile. 

 While Ash glittered in diamonds, Rachna managed a solitary mangalsutra. 

 Sahil, clad in a simple white shirt and black trousers, however, does not think highly of the razzmatazz at the Bachchan bungalows.

 I think its a waste of time and money. I dont believe in it. People like Amitabh Bachchan should donate it to charity instead of making such a show of his wealth and power. As far as I am concerned, I am happy just being with the person I love, said Sahil, who refused to pose for a picture with his bride.

 The wedding cost Rachna and Sahil a mere Rs 2,000, small change when you consider the hole Bachchan Junior must have burnt in his dads pocket.

 Sahil insists the wedding dates have coincided by chance. We had decided on the date a month back, they hadnt. So, I think once they came to know that Rachna and Sahil are getting married on the 20th, they decided to follow suit! he said, breaking into peals of laughter.

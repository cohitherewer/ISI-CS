 Rice on nuke mission with eye on slavery

 Condoleezza Rice

 Washington, June 13: US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice will come with a bagful of carrots and sticks when she arrives in New Delhi next month to have another go at breathing new life into the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 While the carrots to be offered to India are still being debated within the Bush administration, this week provided some indications about the sticks Rice will have in her baggage bound for New Delhi.

 For nearly a week now, Washingtons Embassy Row and Foggy Bottom, home to the state department, have been echoing spicy details of a fierce row between Rice and recently appointed deputy secretary of state, John Negroponte, over the India policy.

 The row pitted Negroponte and ambassador Mark Lagon who was appointed director of the state departments Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons a fortnight ago against Rice and the under-secretary of state for political affairs, Nicholas Burns, over modern-day slavery in India.

 Lagon, an admirer of Ronald Reagans foreign policy and a close associate of the late Jeane Kirkpatrick, Reagans ambassador to the UN, evokes emotions reminiscent of gunboat diplomacy with India in a bygone era of how Republicans looked at New Delhi.

 At a briefing yesterday while releasing the state departments 2007 Trafficking in Persons Report, Lagon said: India has the worlds largest labour trafficking problem with hundreds of thousands of sex trafficking victims and millions of bonded labourers, including forced child labourers.

 Lagons suo motu condemnation of India prompted a flurry of reporters questions on New Delhis record and set the stage for a day-long criticism of the country by non-government organisations, human rights activists and India-baiters on American television, which was followed up by the print media today.

 In India, there is no national anti-trafficking effort, no recognition of bonded labour on an official level, and poor efforts against sex trafficking. The worlds largest democracy has the worlds largest problem of human trafficking, Lagon added.

 India has been on the state departments Tier-2 watchlist for human trafficking four years in a row.

 According to accounts circulating here, Negroponte, supported by Lagon, moved this year to downgrade India to Tier-3, a list of the worst offenders.

 Tier-3 states include the remaining countries on President George W. Bushs axis of evil Iran and North Korea, as well as Cuba and Venezuela, which are perennial thorns on Americas side.

 Sanctions can be imposed on a Tier-3 country if it does not improve its human trafficking record within 90 days of the publication of the report.

 When the final draft of the latest report went to Rice, she insisted that India should not be in the category of worst offenders, but should remain on the Tier-2 watchlist. She is understood to have been supported by Burns, who already has the daunting task of selling to New Delhi the 123 agreement as a follow-up to the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 After a long wrangling session, Rice agreed to a compromise. She will do a special evaluation of India in six months and then decide on a course of action.

 The belief here is that the special evaluation will go against India if her visit to New Delhi next month to take forward the nuclear deal and an Indo-US summit later this year do not see a compromise on the 123 agreement.

 Rice will also be watching if New Delhi is in a mood to give the Americans a huge order for multi-role combat aircraft.

 Placing India in Tier-3 could have prevented the US from selling the aircraft to India. Washington is very keen to secure the order, which will be the biggest military aviation deal in history.

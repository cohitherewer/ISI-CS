 Husain to move SC soon: Lawyer

 OUR BUREAU

 Husain

 New Delhi, May 7: M.F. Husain has asked his lawyer to move the Supreme Court for the transfer to Delhi of the Hardwar case, in which orders have been passed for the attachment of his property.

 I have got instructions from my client and will be moving court soon, lawyer Akhil Sibal told The Telegraph. He did not disclose details, but it is expected that he will seek a stay on the attachment order. 

 The case relates to Husains nude paintings of Hindu goddesses and a notional Bharat Mata.

 Sibal said his client had not received summons from the Hardwar court but, since an order for attachment of properties has been passed, the Supreme Court will be moved to get the case shifted to Delhis Patiala House Courts.

 Four cases against him in Rajkot, Bhopal, Indore and Pandharpur (Maharashtra) were shifted to Delhi last year after Husain filed a petition in the Supreme Court asking for similar cases to be transferred and clubbed. A fifth case, similar to the ones shifted, is being heard in Patiala House Courts.

 We have also moved Delhi High Court challenging the (four) petitions and Husain has been exempted from appearance in these cases. So, it is not a deliberate move by my client to skip the hearings in Hardwar. We are participating fully in the legal process. He was obviously not aware of the case, said Sibal, son of Union minister Kapil Sibal, who is also a well-known lawyer.

 Sibal, who said he received instructions for the legal moves on phone, refused to disclose where the 91-year-old artist was at this point of time. All he would say was that Husain is on the move, and could be in Dubai or London. 

 Since the apex court has transferred cases against Husain to Delhi in the past, Sibal said he was confident that his request for shifting the Hardwar case would be accepted.

 This isnt the first time the artist is approaching the apex court for relief in cases filed across the country. In 1999, he faced a barrage of suits in Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra over a painting of Draupadi. The artist, who first had the cases transferred, later won orders in his favour.

 Husain has argued the untitled Bharat Mata painting was not put up for public exhibition. It was sold to a private collector, he said.

 The problem arose after it was titled Bharat Mata and posted on an online auction for charity in February 2006 to help victims of the Kashmir earthquake. The title was given without his prior knowledge or consent, Husain said, adding that he had even apologised for it.

 Flat ownership

 As his legal strategy was finalised, it emerged on Monday that the title of Husains south Mumbai flat was recently changed to his son Shafats name. A property cannot be seized if it does not belong to a person who is an accused in a case.

 The collector (city) has informed us that the property is in his (Husain) sons name. The title is said to have been changed some days ago, a senior police official told PTI. 

 Husains son Shafat, who lives in the flat, is believed to be on summer vacation in the Gulf.

 Bribes, too, have tribes

 OUR BUREAU

New Delhi, Feb. 12: The clerk who demands a bribe over a power connection and the one who allows a builder to get around a bylaw for a fee could now be treated differently under the law.

 The second Administrative Reforms Commission today suggested that bribery be split into two categories: coercive and collusive.

 The panel didnt clearly specify how the two offences should be dealt with but hinted that the second one might be considered the worse.

 It noted that in the first one category, the briber is a victim of extortion. One is compelled to pay for simple service, because if he does not submit to the extraordinary demands of the official, he ends up losing much more than the bribe.

 In the second kind, the briber pays off the official for an illegal transaction that causes a loss to the state exchequer or public interest.

 The commission said a law should be enacted to make corrupt officials pay damages.

 In addition to the penalty in criminal cases, the law should provide that public servants who cause loss to the state or citizens by their corrupt acts should be made liable to make good the loss and, in addition, be liable for damage.

 Whatever the kind of bribe, if any judge, magistrate or public servant is caught accepting one, no sanction should be necessary to prosecute him. The Supreme Court had earlier ruled that the need for sanction could be waived only if the offence was unrelated to the discharge of the accused persons official duty.

 When sanction is needed, the commission believes, the decision should be taken not by the government but by an empowered committee, with a central vigilance commissioner and the department secretary as its members.

 When the accused is a secretary to the government, the committee would have the cabinet secretary and the central vigilance commissioner on it.

 In all cases, the order granting sanction for prosecution or otherwise shall be issued within two months. In case of refusal, the reasons will be issued within two months, the commission said.

 The panel suggested that benami transactions be banned so that the government has no trouble confiscating corrupt officials property.

 The commission wants the ambit of the Prevention of Corruption Act widened to include private providers of public utility services, and a separate law passed to deal with offences involving Rs 10 crore or more.

 The new law to deal with serious economic offences (SEOs) should also cover NGOs.

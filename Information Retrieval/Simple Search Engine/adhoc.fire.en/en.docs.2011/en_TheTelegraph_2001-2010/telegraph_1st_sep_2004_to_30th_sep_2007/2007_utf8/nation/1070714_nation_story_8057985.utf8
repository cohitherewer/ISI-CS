 Rams son blames cops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, July 13: The family of P.C. Ram tonight demanded a CBI probe into the encounter that claimed the life of the Food Corporation of India official. 

 They also sought a second post-mortem and claimed they had got permission for it from the Union home ministry. 

 Speaking from Ghaziabad, Rams son Pravin accused Assam police of deliberately killing his father. 

 The FCI official taken hostage by Ulfa in April was found dead after a shootout between the militants and police on Wednesday night. 

 Rams body, which reached New Delhi this evening, has been kept in a mortuary on Lodhi Road. 

 We will be informed tomorrow where the second autopsy will be conducted. I dont know what the outcome of the post-mortem will be but I want to give it a try, Pravin said. 

 The FCI officials son said he had information that Ulfa militants were planning to release his father yesterday morning. 

 Ulfa wanted to release him. Otherwise, there was no need to bring him so close to Guwahati, which is a highly secure area, he said. 

 Pravin said he was not buying the polices version that one of the Ulfa militants killed his father. 

 They (the police) have killed my father in a pre-planned manner and I will now knock every possible door to get justice, he said.

 He said he was neither shown the post-mortem report nor the photographs of the encounter site despite repeated requests to the government. 

 The body will be cremated tomorrow after the second autopsy, Pravin said.

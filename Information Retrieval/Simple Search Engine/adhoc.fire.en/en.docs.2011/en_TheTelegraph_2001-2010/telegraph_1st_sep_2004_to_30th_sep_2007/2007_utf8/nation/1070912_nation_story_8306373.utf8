 Bofors scouts for deals

 A Bofors gun

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: Bofors is back in business in India but is still hunting for big-ticket deals after its bid for a heavy artillery order was nixed despite performing better than its rivals in the trials.

 The company, now operating as Bae Systems SWS, has signed an agreement with the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) to upgrade anti-aircraft guns for the Indian Army. 

 The agreement was signed by OFB chairman Sudipta Ghosh and chairman of Bae Systems, Haken Kangert, in Calcutta recently. 

 In February and March this year, the defence ministry decided to re-tender for orders to buy 155mm/52 calibre artillery guns even after the Bofors gun outraced other competitors, chiefly Soltam of Israel. 

 The orders for towed and self-propelled guns are likely to run into $2 billion. 

 The upgrade arrangement for the anti-aircraft guns is a small order in comparison but figures were not available. Official sources said the price of the order would be known only after the upgraded guns were acceptable to the army. The 40mm L-70 anti-aircraft guns were procured from Bofors originally in the 1960s. 

 The L-70 guns have been through one upgrade. The army uses more than 600 L-70s for its air defence regiments. 

 The guns are not produced by the ordnance factories under licence from Bofors. The upgrade will be carried out in the factories with Bofors supplying night-vision capability and electronic counter-measures against jamming. The gun is used by the army to target low-level but high-speed aircraft.

 Bofors started knocking on Indian doors for business in 2002. When it entered the Indian artillery competition, it was with optimism despite the stigma of the scam. 

 The 155mm Howitzers it had supplied had performed well in the 1999 Kargil war, the army certified.

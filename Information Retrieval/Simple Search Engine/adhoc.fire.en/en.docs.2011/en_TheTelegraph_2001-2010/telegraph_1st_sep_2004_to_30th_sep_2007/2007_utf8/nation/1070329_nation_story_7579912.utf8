 Fear stalks poll-eve Palamau

 SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA

 Daltonganj, March 28: Refusal to do poll duty today landed Md Suleiman in jail. A bus driver employed by the Sacred Heart School at Daltonganj, he had refused to accompany polling personnel to Chatarpur, one of the extremist strongholds, for conducting the byelection tomorrow.

 The election is being held to fill a vacancy in the Lok Sabha caused by the expulsion of RJD leader Manoj Bhuiyan, caught on camera in the cash for question scandal.

 Officials have had a tough time persuading employees to take up poll duty. Fear of landmines and Maoist attack loomed large over sullen polling personnel, the last batches of whom left today to set up over 1,300 booths, spread across six Assembly constituencies.

 The administration has turned the constituency into a fortress with 50 companies of central paramilitary forces, besides the state armed police, innumerable vehicles and two choppers, mobilised to oversee the byelection.

 Unconfirmed reports late on Wednesday spoke of a bandh call by the Maoists on the polling day. 

 State chief electoral officer Debashish Gupta, however, played down the threat from extremists. We are hoping for the best and are prepared for the worst, he said, while claiming that measures have been taken for holding a fair and peaceful election.

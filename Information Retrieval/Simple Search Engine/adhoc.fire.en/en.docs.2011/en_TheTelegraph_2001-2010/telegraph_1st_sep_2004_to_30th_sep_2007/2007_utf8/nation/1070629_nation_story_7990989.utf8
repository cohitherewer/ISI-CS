The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Kargil barb 

 New Delhi, June 28: The BJP today alleged that a bank owned by Pratibha Patil had not deposited employees salary in the Kargil Fund.

 It claimed that the one-day salary of Pratibha Mahila Sahakari Banks employees had been deducted, but not deposited in the fund. Pratibha, the UPA-Lefts presidential candidate, was the banks founder chairperson.

 If such a gross complaint is made by the employees of a bank, which is established and controlled by Mrs Pratibha Patil and her family members, how can the nation have assurance about her as the supreme commander of the armed forces? asked BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Flowers have no power over judges

 When

 judges fume,

 floor em

 with flowers.

 The ADMK took

 this a little

 too literally,

 rolling out

 a carpet of

 flowers for

 the judges

 of Madras High

 Court.

 Lawyers owing allegiance to the Jayalalithaa-led ADMK wanted to symbolically express their solidarity with the judges in the wake of a government-judiciary squabble. 

 Arcot Veerasamy, a senior minister in the ruling DMK, had lashed out at high court judges over some rulings related to the functioning of the government and the way the Chennai corporation polls had been conducted. 

 But the flower-carpet welcome could not quite work its charm on the men with the gavel.

 As the judges tiptoed carefully to their chambers to avoid crushing the flowers, Chief Justice A.P. Shah was more concerned about the fact that the passage is a high-security area. The flowers were ordered to be removed immediately.

 Boo to bear dance

 You can give them a bear hug, but think twice before making them dance to your tunes. 

 Hotels, tour operators and bookstores are cracking the whip on street shows in the capital using bears.

 Say No to Bear Dancing has been launched by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) and the World Society for Protection of Animals to create awareness among people to discourage such shows.

 Bear shows in which the muzzled animals sway and gyrate on their hind legs to popular tunes were declared illegal in 1998 and made a punishable offence under wildlife laws.

 This is the first part of our campaign. Gradually, we will target places beyond the national capital, says WTI director (marketing) Mandeepa Ahluwalia.

 Hotels, including Claridges and Ashoka, and bookstores have plastered their walls with posters while seven billboards have been put up at prominent places.

 Tour operators are carrying on the crusade in their coaches and cabs to make foreign tourists aware.

 Corpse collector

 He lends beauty to the homes of the living and dignity to the last journey of the forgotten dead.

 For the last 30-odd years, interior decorator Kishore C. Bhatt has been collecting unclaimed bodies from hospital morgues and police stations and performing their last rites. 

 In 1968, after the floods in Surat where I was staying, I was aghast to see so many dead bodies strewn around me, he says. And nobody was there to care for them. The last rites of a human being are very important for the peace of his soul. 

 It was then that Bhatt found his calling.

 He has been travelling across Maharashtra collecting corpses. I travel whenever I am required, Bhatt says. I have gone to places like Wapi, Daman , Sion, Borivli. Time and money are no object.

 NTR poison

 Anything with NTRs name on it is poison for the Congress the party the matinee idol-turned-chief minister kept out of power for the better part of two decades.

 Its no surprise then that the YSR government has forgotten to give away the NTR lifetime achievement award for the third year in a row. 

 What the government wont do, many others will. Director-producer K.S. Rama Rao has offered to sponsor the award, which comes with Rs 2 lakh, a citation and a trophy. Actor Mohan Babu is willing too. So are Lakshmi Parvati, NTRs second wife, and actor son Balakrishna.

 N. Chandrababu Naidu, the son-in-law who stabbed NTR in the back and then set up the award after he died, is lying low.

 Ahmedabad, July 6: A group of unidentified youths today attacked Shivaji Panikkar, the suspended fine arts dean of Maharaja Sayajirao University (MSU) in Vadodara.

 Panikkar escaped unhurt but his driver was badly injured. 

 The professor was in Ahmedabad to inaugurate the Students Festival for Peace, Justice and Communal Harmony, organised by Anhad, a Delhi-based NGO. 

 As soon as Panikkars Tata Indica arrived at St Xaviers Social Service Society in Naranpura, around 20 youths waiting at the gate surrounded his car and began shouting slogans like Panikkar go back. 

 Some of them screamed: How did you dare to come to Ahmedabad? We will finish you.

 Sensing trouble, Panikkar tried to shut the window of his car, but by then the mob had smashed the windshield with stones and sticks. They rained blows on the driver and also tried to pull Panikkar out. But Shabnam Hashmi, the organiser of the festival, managed to push him inside the car.

 Panikkar had been suspended in May after he refused to close an art exhibition in MSU, which was vandalised by right wing activists for featuring controversial pictures of gods and goddesses. 

 The professor lodged an FIR against unidentified attackers this morning. But he said the men, who chose to come without any banner, were affiliated to some right-wing organisation or a combination of many outfits.

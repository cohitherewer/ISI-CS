 Uma return signal

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, April 12: Uma Bharti may be making a last-ditch attempt to return to the BJP. 

 At a news conference she plans to address on Friday, the expelled leader is likely to stress the need for Hindu forces to unite.

 A similar sentiment was echoed by the VHPs Ashok Singhal, believed to be brokering a deal with the BJP for Umas return. To defeat the anti-Hindu forces in Uttar Pradesh, it is necessary that all Hindu forces unite. 

 Last month, Singhal had met Atal Bihari Vajpayee with the proposal. The former Prime Minister isnt averse to the idea of Umas return.

 BJP president Rajnath Singh would also like to have Uma a woman OBC leader with charisma back. 

 Outside the party, Uma has caused the BJP considerable damage. An example of this was evident in Uttaranchals Tehri, a former princely state. Manavendra Shah, the former king, had been an MP for eight consecutive terms. On his death, his son was fielded by the BJP, but lost because of a candidate Uma had put up. 

 For Uma, too, the going hasnt been easy. Her candidate couldnt win Madhya Pradeshs Bada Malhara Assembly seat, part of her own constituency. 

 It is rumoured that Uma, on being removed from the chief ministership of Madhya Pradesh, had locked herself in a room with Sanjay Joshi at the BJPs Ashoka Road office and beat him up. It is just the kind of behaviour the second-rung leaders refer to and would not want a repeat. To be fair, Uma is seen as a threat to these leaders within the party.

 L.K. Advani, notwithstanding his public spat with Uma, would not mind her in the party. That Ashok Singhal is brokering the deal shows the Sangh also supports the idea. The BJP may take her back.

 Uma Bharti, the prodigal daughter, may just be coming back.

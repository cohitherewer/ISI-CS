 Sony laptop case

 New Delhi, Aug. 9 (PTI): Sony might need a battery of lawyers to stave off charges its laptop batteries are faulty.

 The National Consumer Commission has sent a notice to the company following a complaint from a Vishakhapatnam businessman who said the batteries exploded.

 The complaint has also sought a class action directive that would mean warning other users. Such a recourse is available under the consumer protection act.

 Manoj Khaitan has claimed in his petition that a Sony laptop he had bought last year exploded with a loud noise on November 26 while he was working on it. 

 The burst was also heard by Khaitans 12-year-old son and his wife, the complaint states, adding that sparks from the laptop set fire to other objects in the house. The flames had to be doused with an extinguisher.

 The company should replace or recall the batteries and pay compensation to all consumers who have suffered damages, Khaitans lawyer M.N. Krishnamani said. 

 (Sony said it has not received the notice, our Delhi bureau adds. The case is old. So far we have not received the courts notice. We will study it properly and revert accordingly, a spokesperson said.)

 Khaitan said he had first noticed defects in August last year. Though he told the company about it, no steps were taken by it to repair the laptop, he claimed. He also produced before the commission online articles that purportedly spelt out the problems with the batteries. The articles said the batteries overheated and started fires.

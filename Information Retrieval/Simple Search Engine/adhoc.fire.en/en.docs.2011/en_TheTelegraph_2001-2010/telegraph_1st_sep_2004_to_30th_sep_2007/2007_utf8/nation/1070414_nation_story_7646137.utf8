 CRiSIS BREWING? The Agni III launch. (PTI)

 New Delhi, April 13: Indias first missile to cross the equator evoked a sharp response from Indonesia today that said two of its aircraft carrying Haj pilgrims had returned to Jakarta after spotting fire in the sky.

 The Agni III, which has a 3000-km-plus range, was laun-ched yesterday from Wheelers Island on the Orissa coast and was in flight for 13 minutes.

 Delhi reacted sharply, saying Jakarta had not paid enough attention to advance warning notifications about the launch.

 New Delhis response is backed up by fact. Unlike many occasions in the past, the test-firing of the Agni III was announced and the news was widely publicised in the national and international media before the launch.

 The chief of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) reacted angrily to the report that Indonesia was not aware of the missile test. You ask Jakarta if they got the NOTAMs or not, he retorted sharply.

 NOTAMs are advance notices sent to aviators and mariners before events like missile tests. Chief controller, research and development, DRDO, C.K. Prahlada said all countries in the Indian Ocean region upto Australia had been informed at least a week back.

 A notice was sent a week before the test by the Indian civil aviation authorities to Air Traffic Control, Jakarta, and other ATCs in the region informing them about the launch window dates, danger time, zone and height, external affairs ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said.

 The ATCs were requested to take action to issue NOTAM (Notice to Aviators and Mariners) in accordance with relevant ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) provisions, Sarna said.

 Indonesian authorities had claimed that the missile test had forced two planes of its national carrier, Garuda, to abort its flight. Garuda Indonesia operations director Ari Sapari has been quoted in an Indonesian newspaper as saying there was no prior information about the test.

 Indonesian foreign office spokesman Kristianto Legowo said Indias ambassador to Indonesia would be called to explain Indias stand. The ballistic test that was done by India caused two Garuda flights to Jeddah and Riyadh to re-route to Jakarta. We are trying to attain clarification from India about the notification, he said.

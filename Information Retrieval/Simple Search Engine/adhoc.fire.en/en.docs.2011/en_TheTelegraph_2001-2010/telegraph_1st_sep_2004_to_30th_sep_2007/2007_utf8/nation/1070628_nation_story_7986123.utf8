 A sartorial storm is sweeping a technology college that has taken it upon itself to turn out smart professionals in blue jeans, full-sleeve white shirts and sneakers.

 Aurora Technology and Research Institute in Uppal, on the outskirts of Hyderabads IT zone, is convinced students of the states technology colleges arent presentable.

 So, college authorities have decreed that the regimen of denims, white shirts and sports shoes will kick in from Thursday. Other colleges in the city have enforced dress codes, but none has kept it only to jeans and shirts. 

 Most engineering students from the state are lagging in placements and campus recruitment because of lack of proper personality development. Denims stand for youth, while white stands for cleanliness and clarity. Sports shoes signify that you have the grit and energy to take on the world, said director Alka Mahajan.

 But a section of the girls have argued that churidars, kurtas and chunnis should continue to be allowed.

 Mahajan has a quaint explanation to reject their plea. Have you not seen the Telugu film Balu where thugs drag a college girl by her chunni? This is how dangerous a chunni can be, she said as she reasoned with some 60 students who wanted a relaxation. 

 Among those in the group was Gomathy Ramakrishna, a second-year student whose parents are opposed to the order. My parents dont accept the code.

 An Osmania University professor whose daughter studies at the college said the students are not lower KG kids who can be forced to wear what they dont want to.

 But Mahajan retorts that it is such an attitude on the part of the parents that has hindered the progress of their children. It is a shame that over 60 per cent of the states software engineers are not taken in by multinational firms on the grounds of poor personality development. The college has 600 students, including 250 girls.

 According to Mahajan, one has to dress light Indian dresses dont make the cut to draw good offers from global firms and overseas assignments. But she added: I hate to call it a uniform. They are not school kids. We are only preparing them for the future.

 The argument has impressed many girls. But they are fretting about the whites. Jeans is cool but a full-sleeved white shirt is crazy. We will look like billboards, said Kamalini Roy. The boys believe denims shouldnt have been limited to blue.

 The diktat is not limited to students, though. Women teachers cannot wear churidars; only saris are permitted. The men have been advised to shift to jeans.

 Poll panels ready, if UPA and Left are

 DHIRENDRA K. JHA

New Delhi, Aug. 21: If the UPA and the Left were to divorce it is still not clear whether they at all want to elections could be quick. 

 While the Constitution allows for six months between one Lok Sabha and the next, the Election Commission usually takes not more than three to four months to hold polls once the House is dissolved.

 Revision of electoral rolls is an ongoing process that begins on January 1 every year, sources said, adding that this is an important part of poll preparedness. 

 The last Lok Sabha elections were completed in less than four months after then President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam proclaimed the dissolution of the House on February 6, 2004. 

 The poll schedule was announced on February 29 just over three weeks after the presidential proclamation and elections were held in four phases between April 20 and May 10. By the end of the month, the new Lok Sabha had taken oath.

 In 1999, however, the commission needed almost the entire six months allotted to it. But the delay, it explained, was because the election schedule had to be drawn up in the most difficult climatic period. 

 The Lok Sabha was dissolved in April 1999 and elections had to be completed by October 21. 

 Pointing at the heat wave, which was followed by floods that continued till September, the commission had said in a statement on May 4, 1999: Almost all elections since 1952 have, therefore, taken place in the period from November to April or at best in May. 

 Elections were held in five phases between September 4 and October 1, 1999.

 The general elections of 1998 held in more favourable weather had taken the usual three-four months. The President announced the dissolution of the Lok Sabha on December 4, 1997, and polls were conducted in February-March 1998. 

 Going by precedent as well as the present level of preparedness, the commission should not take more than the usual three-four months to hold elections once the Lok Sabha is dissolved. 

 But that would be only if the Left withdraws support and votes with the BJP to topple the UPA or the Congress decides to go for snap polls instead of trying to run a minority government. Neither side has suggested that this is what it plans to do.

 Hasina: Back home again

 New Delhi, May 15: India is very happy that Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina is back home in Bangladesh.

 Delhi understands that elections should be held as early as possible but agrees that the political process needs to be cleansed as is being done by Dhakas army-led government.

 Sources in the establishment spoke on a variety of foreign policy issues in the capital today from Indias concern over the unstable situation in Pakistan to the need for Sri Lanka to evolve a much more comprehensive package where power could be shared with the Tamil population.

 On the nuclear deal being negotiated with the US, the sources said talks were on track and India would not close its option to conduct a test. 

 They said the US undersecretary of state for political affairs, Nicholas Burns, would be in town next week for another round of talks.

 The situation in Pakistan is not good, a source said, adding that what happened in Karachi on Saturday was terrible.

 The sources pointed out that despite the instability in Pakistan, Delhi had decided to stick to the peace process because Indias goals were not limited to negotiating with the regime there, but included the people of that country.

 So whether President Pervez Musharraf stayed or was ousted from power either by pressure from within the army or from outside Delhi would persist with the peace momentum. The Indian agenda to continue the negotiations was being done in Indian interest, they said.

 Hence, Delhi had decided to continue with the composite dialogue with Pakistan over the next few weeks, beginning with talks on the Tulbul navigation project in June, terrorism in July and economic cooperation in August.

 However, the sources felt that the Pakistan Army continued to play a key role in politics, despite the popular upsurge against Musharrafs sacking of the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Iftikhar Chaudhry. Under the circumstances, the power balance was not going to undergo any dramatic change as was being anticipated.

 On Bangladesh, the sources said things were moving in the right direction with Hasina returning home and the army-backed regime cleaning up corrupt political institutions.

 For us, its a sign of hope, a source said, pointing out that whenever normal political processes had functioned in Bangladesh, they had worked in Indias favour. Terrorists had always taken advantage of closed political processes.

 The sources said Bangladeshs incredible political activism was commendable and the Bangladeshi polity, despite having been under martial rule, was quite different from that in Pakistan.

 5 migrants killed in Manipur

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Imphal, March 9: Five Bengali migrant labourers were shot dead by unidentified gunmen at Ningthoukhong Bazar in Manipurs Bishenpur district late last night. Four of them were from Silchar in neighbouring Assam and one from Tripura. 

 Police said the gunmen abducted the five from their rented houses and brought them in an auto-rickshaw to Ningthoukhong Kha Khunou Ward 4 where they forced them to lie on the ground and shot them dead from point blank range. 

 The police recovered the bodies of Raju Dev, 43, Pintoo, 18, Raju, 18, Babua, 18, all from Silchar, and 34-year-old Pradeep Dev from Agartala, this morning. 

 The victims were working in a local bakery and also hawked wares in the district to earn some extra money. The police questioned some local residents, but no arrests were made.

 The incident has triggered panic among migrant labourers in the district. The market remained closed today in protest against the killings. 

 Meira Paibis (womens group) of the locality took out a rally from the scene of the crime to the local marketplace to denounce the killings.

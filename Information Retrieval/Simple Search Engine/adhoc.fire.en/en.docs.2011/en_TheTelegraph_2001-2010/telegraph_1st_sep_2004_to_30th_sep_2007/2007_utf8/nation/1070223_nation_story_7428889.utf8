 35 let off in Dalit murders

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai/Nagpur, Feb. 22: A special court today discharged 35 people arrested for alleged involvement in last years Dalit killings in Khairlanji after the CBI said there wasnt adequate evidence against them.

 The 35 include then police sub-inspector Siddheshwar Bharane, Khairlanji sarpanch Upasrao Khandate and his deputy Urkunda Khurpe. Dalit groups across Maharashtra had been the most vocal in demanding the trios arrest.

 The upper castes of Khairlanji village in Bhandara district had allegedly tortured to death four members of a Dalit family on September 29, 2006. Police inaction and delay in investigations had sparked a violent backlash by Dalit groups in December.

 The fury spread across the state, with a mob torching coaches of the Mumbai-Pune Deccan Queen in Mumbai.

 The state crime intelligence department, probing the case, arrested 46 people. 

 But the protests continued, and the probe was handed to the CBI. On December 27, the investigating agency filed a principal chargesheet against only 11 of the 46 accused and told the special court that it needed to conduct further investigations against the rest.

 Last week, the CBI filed a supplementary chargesheet against the 11 prime accused and informed the court that its investigation was complete, but it could not press charges against the 35 accused due to lack of adequate evidence, defence counsel Neeraj Khandewale said over phone from Bhandara, where the special court is located.

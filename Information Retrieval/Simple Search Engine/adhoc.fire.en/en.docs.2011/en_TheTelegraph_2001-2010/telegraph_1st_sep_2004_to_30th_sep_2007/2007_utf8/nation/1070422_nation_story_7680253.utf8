 Mumbai, April 21: A white Skoda, MH02J-A11. That was the paalki for the new bahu of Bollywoods first family and not the much-clicked red doli. Driving Aishwarya Rai from her Bandra home was father-in-law Amitabh Bachchan, as Abhishek kept her company in the backseat.

 Sources confirmed that while the see-off was emotional, an excited Aishwarya didnt cry. 

 For those who thought the grand AbAsh wedding at Prateeksha yesterday drew the curtains on the marriage of the season, they couldnt have been more off the mark. 

 The vidai turned out to be yet another glittering addition to the celebrations with a special lunch hosted by the Rais at their La Mer home. 

 According to sources, it was Ashs idea to call close friends who could not be invited either to the sangeet or the wedding ceremony, both of which were essentially Bachchan bashes.

 So along with the Bachchans, the Nandas and the Ambanis, Ashs relatives, neighbours and most of her brand associates had lunch with the couple today.

 DTC (Diamond Trading Company) director Prasad Kapre was seen entering La Mer. Kapre had drafted in Ash for the Nakshatra diamond campaign. Most of the companies that Ash endorses have supposedly showered the bride with gifts.

 If the Bachchans got food from Amitabhs favourite haunt Taj Mahal Hotel for the sangeet and wedding parties, the spread for the lunch came from Grand Maratha Sheraton amp; Towers. It included the Mangalorean Fish Curry, the favourite on the menu, and Badam Ka Halwa for dessert. 

 At Prateeksha, where the newly-weds were headed for a customary puja, the crowds were still waiting.

 Although the numbers were less than yesterday, a scuffle broke out with securitymen leading a lathicharge. They behaved like ruffians, and shoved and pushed us, said a photographer.

 Photographers said Black Cat commandos assigned to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh were doing duty for the Bachchans.

 South City fall

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 5: A labourer at Calcuttas biggest real-estate project, South City off Prince Anwar Shah Road, fell 27 floors to his death while work was going on around 9 pm today.

 Nemai Mirdha fell from the 27th floor of one of the buildings of the housing complex and died on the spot. We have started a probe but its too early to say anything in detail, said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.

 This is the second tragedy in eight months on the 31-acre site, the previous one occurring in July 2006 when labourer Sujan Khatua fell from the 32nd floor of the second tower. Earlier, three labourers had been killed in an accident while working on the project that promises to redefine the experience of luxury living.

 As Mirdha lay bleeding, fellow labourers rushed to his aid while some informed the site engineers. The Jadavpur police were called to the spot.

 I am not in a position to comment on this at this time of night, said D.J. Chakrabarty, South City business development manager.

 There isnt much information except that the youth was rushed to a nursing home where he died. I would be able to speak about it tomorrow.

 The body has been sent for post-mortem.

 Cockpit coup: Tata flies F-16

 Bangalore, Feb. 8: 13.25: Ratan Tata is strapped on inside the F-16 cockpit. The canopy is still up. Paul Hattendorf, a Lockheed Martin test pilot, is piloting the F-16 block 50. This aircraft has been leased by Lockheed Martin from the US Air Force. 

 13.27: Canopy down. 

 13.28: Tail light starts blinking. The single engine is on. 

 For the next 10 minutes, the pilot briefs Tata on the intercom. Tata is sitting in the rear seat with the G-suit on and the helmet visor up. A Boeing Chinook hovers in the background carrying air chief-designate F.H. Major. 

 On the ground, two marshals feel the body of the aircraft. 

 The flight takes an L-turn. Tata does a thumbs-up. 

 As a publicity gimmick, Lockheed Martin pulled off a coup. It doesnt get any bigger than this for public relations executives at Aero India 2007. 

 Boeing is now pleading with Tata to take a sortie on its own F/A 18F Super Hornet. The sortie has been booked for 2 pm on Friday. Tata has not yet said yes. He is considering the offer.

 How did Lockheed Martin pull it off? Says Joseph Stout, its spokesman: Mr Tata is a pilot himself and he was interested in flying the F-16. The US embassy extended the invitation and he agreed.

 By now, Tatas aircraft is taxiing to the top of the runway. 

 Paul will let him take control since he is a qualified pilot and will get an opportunity to see how it feels.

 Lockheed has been considering celebrity flights at the air show for some time. They had also sounded Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan, but they had decided that the captain of Indian industry was the best bet. It helped Tata is a certified pilot. 

 The F-16 has now taken off with a roar that has Tata and Lockheed Martin executives applauding. The orange of its after-burner, as it climbs steeply, shows despite the bright sun. 

 Under rules of the air show, demonstration flights are not to go supersonic over Yelahanka. Also, aircraft with passengers are not allowed complex manoeuvres. 

 Tata is 69 years old and the strain will show when he lands. Other celebrities in India who have taken sorties on fighters George Fernandes on the MiG-21 and A.P.J. Abdul Kalam on Su-30 MKI. Both had political points to score or shoot down. 

 But Tata has none. That is apparent. How much money would a Tata charge to model for Lockheed Martin? Probably not a paisa unless he is scraping the bottom to finance Coruss takeover. 

 One possible explanation for the sortie that gives a whole new meaning to Tata Sky is that Tata is keen on offsets that will result out of major air force deals under the current procurement policy. The policy states that up to 30 per cent of the value of a deal should be ploughed back into Indian industry. 

 At 2.35, the F-16 lands. Minister of state for defence Pallumraju is there for a photo-op with Tata. 

 Sweaty, flush-faced and clearly tired, Tata emerges out of the cockpit with some difficulty, trying not to accidentally hit the open canopy with his head. Immediately, he undoes the G-suit. Great feeling. It was a great experience, he says. 

 It is a terrific airplane. We did a few things, where the commander took over and did some rolls. All of it was very exciting, adds the trained pilot. J.R.D. Tata, from whom Ratan took over the baton, started Indias first aviation company in the 1930s.

 The F-16 went down about 500 ft towards the deck. You climb one hill and come down, turn over. It is just an unbelievable experience, Tata says. For someone who is not used to it, you end up feeling tired, he adds.

 Hattendorf is all praise for Tata. He was in control for most of the flight. We flew at 18,000 feet and did a maximum speed of 1.93 Mach. We were handed over from Yelahanka to Bangalore airport tower control.

 The Lockheed test pilot says they did some elementary manoeuvres. Tata kept chattering on the intercom almost throughout the flight.

 Cong duo with Modi

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 21: Two Congress MLAs have joined the BJP, in a leg-up to Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi who is under fire from rebels.

 Manish Gilitwala, who represents Surat (east), and Shankar Vargli from Umargaon switched loyalties at a fishermens convention, praising Modi as an able leader and performer. 

 The duo shared the dais with the chief minister at Billimora in south Gujarat, where the meeting was held.

 For Modi, the entry of the Congress MLAs has come as a huge morale-booster after five BJP MLAs were suspended in recent weeks for campaigning against him.

 Modi, who had refrained from speaking out openly against the rebels so far, used the opportunity to train his guns on them, saying those railing against him were corrupt. 

 Because I did not allow these unscrupulous people to loot the state, they have turned against me, he added. 

 Modi blessed Gilitwala and Vargli. 

 The Congress MLAs returned the favour, saying they were joining the BJP because they were impressed by the extraordinary performance of the state under the leadership of Modi and wanted to work closely with him. 

 Congress legislature party leader Arjun Modhwadia confirmed that the MLAs had left but claimed that their departures would not be a setback to the party. 

 They had become a liability for the party. We had been receiving a lot of complaints from their constituencies against them. The party had decided not to nominate them. Thats why they deserted the Congress, he said.

 But BJP spokesperson Vijay Rupani claimed more Congress leaders were waiting to cross over. He said at least a dozen MLAs were in touch with his party. 

 He denied the MLAs were lured with promises of tickets and ministerial berths. Elections in Gujarat will be held later this year.

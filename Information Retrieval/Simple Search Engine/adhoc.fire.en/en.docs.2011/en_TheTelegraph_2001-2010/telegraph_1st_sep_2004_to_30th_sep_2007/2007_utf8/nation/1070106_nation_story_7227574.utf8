 Puri

 Does not have a queue for VIPs yet, but after the November 4 

 stampede, the idea has been under consideration 

New Delhi, Jan. 5: The Supreme Court today put its seal on VIP treatment of guests and dignitaries and those paying for special darshan at Keralas Sabarimala temple. 

 A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhan passed the order on a petition challenging a December 2005 Kerala High Court order banning special treatment of any devotee. Under the ruling first put on hold to allow time for appeal and later stayed by the Supreme Court VIP queues in front of the sanctum sanctorum were forbidden.

 The apex court has now permitted the Travancore Devaswom Board, which manages the temple, to allow VIPs to come near the sanctum sanctorum. They can bring not more than four persons. No guests will be allowed for former VIPs. 

 These measures will help ensure that common people get a clear view of Lord Ayyappa. Board president G. Raman Nair said details of VIP darshan are yet to be worked out. 

 Temple authorities say they also allow old women, children and the physically challenged in a special queue. The board will finalise the VIP criteria after getting details of the verdict. Ordinary devotees wont be put to inconvenience, he said.

 Another category of VIPs who pay to attend pujas have also been allowed for some rituals, with five family members. Temple staff, police officers above the rank of SP posted at the site and special commissioner appointed by high court will also have access, but without obstructing the general queue in any way.

 Devotees who have remitted money for puja would be given special consideration, by reducing the waiting time. During the peak season, at this time of the year, devotees have to stand in a queue for up to eight hours, said the boards executive officer, Thulaseedharan Thampy. 

 Papers filed with the apex court show that Padipooja tickets, which cost Rs 30,000, have been booked till 2017. Those of udayasthamana pooja, at Rs 20,000, are sold out till 2010. The court has also allowed special treatment to the first five who pay Rs 2,500 (for Nitya pooja), Rs 2,000 (for Uchcha pooja) or Rs 500 (for Usha pooja) a day in advance.

 Lok Sabha secretary-general T. D. P. Achary will visit the shrine tomorrow. Singer K.J. Yesudas, actor Vivek Oberoi and most South Indian film stars are regulars at the temple. Amitabh Bachchan had paid a visit after recovering from his accident on the set of Coolie.

 Twenty20 gets eyeballs amp; ads

 - Sixes undo world cup damage

 The smiles are back on the faces of advertisers, five months after their hopes and fortunes went for a six with Team Indias early exit from the World Cup.

 This time, though, it is the sixes flying across grounds in South Africa that have drawn people back to TV and scripted a turnaround in ad rates and television rating points (TRPs), the gauge of a programmes popularity that also influences how much advertisers pay.

 Purists might snigger at the rapid-fire Twenty20, saying crickets ultra-short version is a poor test of sporting prowess, but advertisers are batting for more of it.

 Broadcasters expect the TRPs to shoot past 8 if India makes it to the Twenty20 final, almost four times the normal figure of 2 for sports events.

 The highest for the tournament was 4.24, during the September 14 India-Pakistan encounter, according to TAM Peoplemeter, which compiles the points. The lowest was 0.19, for the West Indies-Bangladesh clash. 

 The figures for the encounters with England when Yuvraj Singh hit six sixes in an over and Thursdays thriller against South Africa are being collated and are likely to be over 7.

 This is in sharp contrast to the World Cup TRPs, which rarely edged above 0.50. The lowest was 0.05, for the New Zealand-Sri Lanka fixture on April 10. 

 High TRPs drive up ad rates paid to broadcasters, in this case ESPN-STAR Sports, which is beaming Twenty20.

 Ten-second slots during matches featuring India have been sold for Rs 2.5-3.5 lakh to big advertisers such as Ford, Maruti, Airtel and Anil Ambani group firms. Although it is not an unusual rate for cricket spots, it is extraordinary that advertisers were willing to pay that much after the World Cup setback, said an official of GroupM, a media buying house.

 The tide has turned. It helps that the commentary for the Twenty20 matches is being broadcast in Hindi, English and Tamil. This means more viewers. ESPN-STAR Sports is laughing all the way to the bank. 

 We kept aside around 25-30 per cent of our ad slots for last-minute sales. These fetched rates almost 70 to 100 per cent higher than what Sony had earned on similar World Cup spots, a source in ESPN-STAR Sports said.

 Ten-second slots for the Indo-Pak encounter went for Rs 3-3.5 lakh, according to TAM Peoplemeter. Even rates during the India-Scotland clash were around Rs 2.5 lakh.

 Compare this with the slump to Rs 20,000-30,000 during the World Cup. Sony struggled to find takers even at that price. Advertisers, hit hard by sinking TRPs, shied away. 

 This time, some advertisers, like Ford, have bought spots for all Twenty20 matches. Others, wary after the World Cup experience, have negotiated for exclusive spots.

 We insisted on protection clauses for our clients buying spots for the Twenty20 tournament. If the TRPs fall below a certain level, the broadcaster has to compensate by slashing ad rates or by providing spots during other popular events, said Manish Porwal, the vice-president of Starcom, a Mumbai-based media buying house.

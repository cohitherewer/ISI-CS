 New Delhi, April 2: Bengal may have a campus affiliated to Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), if the Prime Ministers Office has its way.

 An HRD ministry-sponsored committee, set up to look into the Sachar committees recommendations for improving the socio-economic condition of Muslims, has proposed four regional AMU campuses in the country. Sources in the ministry said the PMO wants to know if one of them can be set up in Bengal. The AMU does not have any other campus at present.

 The decision rests with the university, which came into being by an act of Parliament, the sources added.

 AMU authorities said they have no objections. The location of a regional campus, if we start one, will depend on two factors the strength of the Muslim population and their level of backwardness, said AMU registrar Faizan Mustafa. On both counts, Bengal could be a favoured destination.

 The HRD sources, however, pointed out that land acquisition in setting up a new university could be a prickly issue in the state. 

 Opening an AMU-affiliated campus will require the Presidents assent and approval. But there can be other forms of collaboration that do not require the Presidents consent, said Mustafa.

 For instance, the Bengal government can use the AMUs skills and expertise in modernising madarsa education and improving womens education. Distance education is one area where we can help a lot, said Rahat Abrar of the AMU.

 It can also lend a hand with its faculty and courses. The government can send its teachers for training, Abrar said. 

 In distance education, the AMU is helping several institutions that have applied for assistance. We have set up a centre where lessons can be transmitted in collaboration with the state government concerned. In many cases, our alumni association helps us, Abrar said. 

 Aligarh Muslim University

 The Sachar committee has shown that that despite an uninterrupted rule for three decades, the Left Front has brought no gains for Muslims in education and employment in Bengal.

 Muslims account for 25 per cent of the population in the state. But only 57.5 per cent of Muslims are literate, as against 72.4 per cent Hindus. The share of Muslims in state government jobs is a mere 2.1 per cent. In public sector undertakings, the scene is even more dismal there are only 1.2 per cent Muslims in higher positions.

 Underlining the Sachar reports observations, Abrar said: Bengal has 25 per cent Muslim population. But it does not have a single degree college for Muslims. 

 The Sachar findings prompted the CPM and the government it leads in Bengal to explore all possible ways of improving the situation. A tie-up with AMU is one of the options.

 The CPM leadership, in its charter of demands on the Sachar report, has sought a quota for Dalit Muslims and the inclusion of Muslim OBCs in the official OBC list.

 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has urged the Planning Commission to introduce a sub-plan for Muslims along the lines of the tribal sub-plan.

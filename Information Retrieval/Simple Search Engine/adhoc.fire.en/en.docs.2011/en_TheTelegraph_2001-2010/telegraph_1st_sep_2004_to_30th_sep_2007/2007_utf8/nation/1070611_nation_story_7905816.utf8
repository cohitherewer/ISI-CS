 Lalu red light to train stunts

 Brakes on Chaiyya chaiyya

 New Delhi, June 10: If Bollywood wants to chal chaiyya chaiyya again, it may have to do it on the back of a truck.

 And a Shah Rukh Khan, however Dilwale, cannot pull a Dulhaniya Kajol into a running train and ride into the sunset.

 The railways have banned shooting of scenes with actors perched on train roofs or footboards, robbing Hindi cinema of a prized platform for action stunts as well as romantic sequences.

 Some staple scenes, too, seem headed for the history books with the new safety guidelines asking film producers to avoid daytime shooting at crowded stations.

 Dhoom:2 stunts with Hrithik Roshan on a sandboard and hooked by a rope to a train running at 60 kmph may be deemed unsafe but whats wrong with Naseeruddin Shah running across the Delhi station to get a bottle of water for a Masoom Jugal Hansraj?

 The railways stand is, it doesnt want passengers to be disturbed.

 But theres one bar that even some of the hardcore movie buffs may welcome: no shooting on tracks while trains are running.

 Such a shoot is alleged to have caused the death of Nadia Khan, the Britain-based assistant director to Kaizad Gustaad, during the making of Mumbai Central near the Mahalaxmi railway station three years ago.

 Lalu Prasads ministry imposes a minor form of censorship, too. Railway authorities will vet scripts to ensure there is no adverse publicity and the railways are not put in a poor light.

 This may not handicap scriptwriters too much: Bollywoods perennial target has been the corrupt policeman, not the travelling ticket examiner.

 Yet another clause is mind-boggling: films are not allowed to change the names of locations, railway stations or trains without the Railway Boards permission.

 The mere fact that the script has been approved, which requires change of name, should not be taken as approval, the guidelines say.

 The railways do not explain whether this merely means that films cant show false signboards bearing fictitious station names, or whether they are banned from having fictitious station names altogether.

 Such a ban three decades ago would have had Ramesh Sippy scouring the railway map to find a Ramgarh station, where Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra get off a train, or change the name of the village in Sholay. In the mid-70s, when there was no such ban, he shot the scene in Bangalore.

 While filmdom must be dismayed, some senior railway babus would be licking their lips. They now have an opportunity to watch shoots and rub shoulders with stars.

 A liaison officer from the publicity department should invariably be attached with the shooting team to ensure there is no large-scale departure from the original and accepted script in respect of railway sequences using buildings, rolling stock, tracks and signals and railway personnel, the guidelines say.

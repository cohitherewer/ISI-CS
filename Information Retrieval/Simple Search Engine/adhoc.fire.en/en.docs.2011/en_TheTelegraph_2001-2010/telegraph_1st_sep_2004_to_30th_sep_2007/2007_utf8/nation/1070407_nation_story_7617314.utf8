 Patna, April 6: How does it feel to be on the other side of the table? At primary schools in Munger, its just the same, as far as wearing uniforms is concerned.

 The district is the first in the country to introduce a dress code for teachers. The change, which came at the beginning of the current academic session in January, is the brainchild of Munger district superintendent of education Shyam Babu Ram. It is being implemented at only the primary level at present. 

 The superintendent said he wanted all 5,200 teachers in 1,000 primary schools to dress smartly and walk confidently.

 According to his written order circulated this January, a male teacher should wear dark brown trousers, sky blue shirt and black shoes from Monday to Friday, while on Saturdays he has to turn up in white for physical training classes. 

 A woman teacher should wear a light pink sari with matching blouse from Monday to Friday and a white sari with red border on Saturdays. 

 If private school teachers earning Rs 2,500-3,000 a month can dress smartly, why cant our teachers do the same? the superintendent asked. 

 However, Ram said, there would be no punitive action against teachers flouting the order. We are not going to bully teachers into falling in line.

 The superintendent said nearly 70 per cent teachers are following the dress code and are happy with the makeover.

 Only the dhoti-wearing brigade has struck a discordant note. A rough estimate suggests that teachers in around 30 per cent primary schools wear dhoti-kurta or kurta-pyjama. 

 Putting a dress code in place is less about enforcing discipline and more about giving a new look to teachers, the superintendent said. 

 I was thrilled when the wife of a teacher at Shivkund called me up to thank me for making her husband wear shirt and trousers for the first time in his life, Ram recalled.

 The woman told him that she had been trying to convince her husband to drop his dhoti and put on trousers when travelling to her parents place, but in vain. 

 Twenty-five years after their marriage, the teacher, Ram Ratan Kumar, finally went to his sasural wearing trousers with his shirt tucked in, the superintendent chuckled.

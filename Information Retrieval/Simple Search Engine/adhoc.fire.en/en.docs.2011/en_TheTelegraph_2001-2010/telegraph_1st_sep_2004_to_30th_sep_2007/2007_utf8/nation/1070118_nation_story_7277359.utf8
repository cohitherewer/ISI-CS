 Builders cant pick and choose

 New Delhi (PTI): The Delhi consumer commission has ruled that builders who do not meet the deadline on the sale agreement cannot cancel the allotment if the purchasers defaulted on paying instalments.

 The commission imposed a fine of Rs 2.51 lakh on Ansal Properties for cancelling the allotment of a flat. The panel said the sale deed has to be read as a whole and not in isolation.

 Construction companies that did not stick to the deed cannot take benefit of the clauses that suited them, the commission said.

 Terms of contract have to be provided the meaning which is in consonance with the aims of the contract. For instance, if the schedule of payment is construction-linked, any breach committed by the service provider by not constructing the flat as per schedule is a breach of contract.

 Therefore, the service provider cannot take advantage of the other terms of the contract which cast obligation upon the consumer to pay the balance amount or in case of delayed payment to pay the interest, the order said.

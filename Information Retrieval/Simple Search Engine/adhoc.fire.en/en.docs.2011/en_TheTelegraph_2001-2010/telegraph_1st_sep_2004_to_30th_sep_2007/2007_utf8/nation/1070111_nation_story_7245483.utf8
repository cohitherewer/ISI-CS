 Dash to put leash on drug price

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Paswan: In a hurry

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: Chemicals and fertiliser minister Ram Vilas Paswan has put 428 drugs under price control in a new policy he intends to bring to the cabinet on Thursday. But many within the government oppose the plan.

 For 74 of these drugs, firms can charge a mark-up of 100 per cent over their manufacturing and selling expenses. For another 354, the limit has been set at 200 per cent. Paswan is believed to have the Lefts backing for the move.

 Officials in his ministry say companies now charge up to 1,000 per cent over their expenses. They contend that a 200 per cent mark-up will still leave them with a profit.

 Sources say Paswans plan is likely to be referred to a group of ministers, who will consult other ministries and pharmaceutical firms, which have been against the move. 

 Paswan also wants the maximum allowable post-manufacturing expenses, now at 100 per cent, to be raised to 150 per cent to cover increased cost of compliance, transportation, local taxes and research bills. He also says research-intensive firms should be allowed 50 per cent more, provided they meet certain standards. 

 Certain drugs will be out of control. Those covered under the Patent Act, 1970 and formulations (the basic chemical ingredient) developed indigenously are on the list.

 Paswan wants a new drug price control order to be issued under the essential commodities act. But many ministers back with the industrys stand that Paswans proposal will achieve little beyond reviving the control-permit regime.

 A policy that talks of setting price controls on drugs should be popular in election-bound states. Other elements likely to please people are the rationalisation of excise duty, promotion of cheaper generic drugs and revival of PSU pharmaceutical companies to produce critical drugs that are in short supply or are too expensive.

 Paswan has also sprinkled other sweeteners in his package. He will propose a free drugs scheme for families below the poverty line, and affordable health insurance. 

 Parties that oppose or stonewall the policy could be criticised as being anti-poor by their opponents in the forthcoming state elections. Paswan has also taken care in sounding out the Left parties on the issue and garnering their support for the move. This could create another problem for the government if it opposes the policy.

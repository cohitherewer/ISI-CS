 Revenue sleuths visit RIL plant

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Ahmedabad, May 28: Directorate of Revenue Intelligence sleuths today visited Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Jamnagar plant to study documents.

 Hemanbika Priya, spokesperson for the Central Board of Excise and Customs, said: DRI officials are currently visiting RIL, Jamnagar, and are studying documents.... Its too premature to say anything further. She added: The visit cannot be termed a raid. 

 Directorate sources said there were suspicions of duty evasion in the way petro-products were being accounted for. The 18-member team had decided to visit Reliances Jamnagar plant to study the situation. They stressed that this did not necessarily mean there was any wrongdoing.

 Reliance Industries spokesman Nitin Bhatt, too, termed the DRI officials visit a routine inspection.

 Sources close to Reliance Industries said the directorate teams visit had to do with the conversion of Jamnagar into an export-oriented unit.

 Reliance Industries is building a 580,000-barrels-a-day refinery that will be complete by 2008.

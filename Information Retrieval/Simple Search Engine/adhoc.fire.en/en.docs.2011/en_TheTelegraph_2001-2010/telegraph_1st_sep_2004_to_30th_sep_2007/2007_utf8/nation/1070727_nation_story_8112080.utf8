 Srinagar, July 26: Two members of a suicide squad were gunned down today after they tried to storm the Bhaba Atomic Research Centre complex that houses a CRPF camp at Zakura on the outskirts of Srinagar.

 A claim was made later over phone that the attack was aimed at exposing suggestions that normality had returned to the Valley. The raid coincided with reports that the Centre was contemplating steps to withdraw troops from some areas of Kashmir.

 At the time of the attack, most of the atomic centres 50 staff members, including some scientists, were inside.

 We do not know whether this attack was aimed at the CRPF or our centre but thank God we are all safe, said G.N. Shah, in-charge of the Bhaba centre. 

 Although the centre had been a prized project of the Union government, much of the work done now is low-key as its senior staff left the Valley in the wake of militancy. Now security forces occupy most of the buildings. 

 The caller claiming to be Lashkar-e-Toiba spokesperson Abdullah Gaznavi told local media that the attack was to denounce claims that peace has returned to the Valley. He also warned of more attacks till their goal was achieved.

 The caller identified the militants as Feroz Ahmad Khan alias Abu Muslim and Abu Maaz.

 CRPF inspector-general S.K. Singh said the two militants tried to sneak in from the rear entrance.

 They lobbed grenades and opened fire while trying to enter the camp of 42 Battalion but our men repulsed the attack. One of the militants was killed outside the post and another took refuge in an adjoining orchard, where he was killed after a two-hour gunfight, said Singh. Another militant who provided cover to these two escaped.

 The last suicide attack on a security camp was carried out in October last year when militants stormed a CRPF post at Akhara building in Srinagars Lal Chowk. Ten people, including two militants and seven security force personnel, had died in the attack. 

 A police spokesperson said eight CRPF men were injured in todays attack and have been shifted to a hospital. He said two AK-47 rifles and other ammunition have been seized from the spot. Following the attack, the forces cordoned off the nearby areas.

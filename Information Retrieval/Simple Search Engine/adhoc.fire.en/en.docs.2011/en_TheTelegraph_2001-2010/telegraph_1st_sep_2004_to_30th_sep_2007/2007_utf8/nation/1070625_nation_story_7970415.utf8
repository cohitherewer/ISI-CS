 Trinamul spoils NDA unity dinner

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 24: The solidarity dinner has left a bitter aftertaste in the NDAs mouth.

 A day before Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat files his nomination to run for President, L.K. Advani hosted a dinner at his home for coalition partners.

 But the Shiv Sena and the Trinamul Congress stayed away. Neither did they sign the first set of nomination papers for Shekhawat.

 Besides, the Janata Dal (United) appeared divided. Sources said George Fernandes and Digvijay Singh had to coax party president Sharad Yadav to add his signature and get him to attend the dinner.

 Trinamuls Dinesh Trivedi said the partys MPs were away in Calcutta to attend a meeting. We are still talking about (A.P.J. Abdul) Kalam. So we cant sign nominations for someone else at the same time. We hope some miracle may happen on Kalam, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Fifth time in Cannes, first as Mrs B

 - Ash likes new surname

Well, it wouldnt be Cannes if Aishwarya Rai was not here, so she did turn up last night, with hubby Abhishek in tow, for the red carpet gala screening of the Norah Jones-starrer My Blueberry Nights.

 It was the first time she was called Mrs B in public and she said she liked it.

 I was kind of getting used to that because its the first time youre being addressed by a new surname and Ive maybe done a double take at times but pleasantly so. It makes us smile, so its been good, she said. 

 This is Aishwaryas fifth consecutive Cannes for she was quick to spot that this is the place for actors to promote themselves if they have Hollywood and global ambitions and the authorities at Cannes have tried to help her because they are partial to her brand of glamour.

 This year, she came as part of LOreals team of models. In the past, she has been present (with Shah Rukh) at the official screening of Devdas. She has been on the jury, too. Another time, she helped Gurinder Chadha launch Bride and Prejudice. 

 By now, she must be pretty much used to her suite at the Martinez, the luxury hotel on the Cannes seafront from where she can view the blinking lights at night of yachts owned by such folk as the Hindujas and the Mittals.

 UTV is hoping that Aishwarya would stay on for the promotional launch of Ashutosh Gowarikers Jodhaa Akbar, based on the love affair between Emperor Akbar and his Rajput wife Jodhaa, but apparently she cannot fit that in. Nor, it seems, will she have time to put in an appearance with Abhishek before the screening of Guru. 

 This is one of seven films being shown over two days in a category known as Cinemas of the World. Most countries are given a day each but, exceptionally, this being the 60th Cannes as well as the 60th year of Indian independence, the festival authorities wanted to make a special gesture towards India.

 UTV says Bipasha Basu and John Abraham will be in Cannes to promote the film Goal. Bipasha has slightly missed the boat, though she should have been here years ago, showing off her legs to the Cannes paparazzi, when Jism was in the news.

 One problem with most Indian stars is that they still expect the kind of VVIP fuss they receive in India. Someone needs to tell them that in Cannes, against the mega names from Hollywood, they barely make the also-ran category.

 After Indian officials had invested much energy on preparing for the arrival of Priya Ranjan Das Munshis debut in Cannes, the information and broadcasting minister abruptly cancelled his trip, leaving the newly-arrived ambassador in Paris, Ranjan Mathai, to formally open the Indian pavilion today on the Croisette.

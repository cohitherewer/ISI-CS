 Reliance eyes more outlets

 OUR BUREAU

 Ranchi, May 13: Vandalism by local vegetable vendors at four newly opened Reliance Fresh outlets yesterday has not deterred the companys plans for Jharkhand.

 So far, customers are only buying fruits and vegetables. They will soon get the opportunity to pick up clothes and dress material from our Reliance Digital and Reliance Hyper Market the new entrants in the state capital, said a top official over phone from Mumbai.

 Our plan is to open one outlet for every 3,000 households and Ranchi will be a part of it, they added.

 Giving details about its expansion, the Reliance officials said a new outlet would be coming up at Bahu Bazaar for non-vegetarian items.

 It was business as usual today in three of Reliance Freshs four outlets in Ranchi SPG Mart in Bahu Bazaar, Laxmi Narayan Market at Tharpakhna and Rathore Tower on Circular Road. 

 The Morabadi outlet could not function because the vendors had damaged it badly during yesterdays protest against farm retail. 

 Officials at this outlet were seen busy assessing the damage with insurance surveyors throughout the day.

 Police, who had failed to act promptly yesterday, were seen on vigil today. Being Sunday and courts being closed, the police produced the miscreants before the chief judicial magistrate at his residence and later sent them to Birsa Munda Central Jail.

 Those arrested included Jharkhand Vikas Morcha leader Uday Shanker Ojha, who had led the vendors in the protest. Ojha said supporting the vendors was his personal decision and the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha had nothing to do with it. 

 I was invited to lead vendors in my personal capacity, he added.

 In response to a bandh called in the city today, few vendors were seen at Lalpur, Bahu Bazaar, Kutchery and Naga Baba Khatal market. Daily Market, however, remained normal.

 Senior police superintendent M.S. Bhatia said more arrests are possible.

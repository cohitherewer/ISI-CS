 Missing girl in Hazra

 Calcutta, Feb. 23: A 21-year-old girl who went missing two weeks ago was found at Hazra crossing this afternoon. She was produced in the Alipore court and handed over to her parents. 

 A fortnight ago, the girls parents had lodged an FIR with Ekbalpore police, alleging that their daughter, a first-year student, had been kidnapped by a local youth called Vinod. The police arrested Vinod a week ago from his Ekbalpore home. 

 Around 3.30 pm today, a relative saw the girl near Hazra crossing and told her to go home. She was adamant, so he called up the police station. Our officers traced the girl, said U.S. Bhattacharjee, officer-in-charge of Ekbalpore police station. 

 The police said the girl had an affair with Vinod.

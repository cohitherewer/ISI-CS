The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Second legislator in net for trafficking 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 18: The arrest of BJP MP Babubhai Katara for his alleged attempt to smuggle a woman and a boy to Canada has caught the attention of the CBI, already probing human trafficking charges against another party MP.

 Four years ago, the agency had booked Ganga Ram Koli for helping nine persons emigrate to the Netherlands illegally. He wasnt a member of Parliament at the time of the alleged crime, but had been one in 1998, having been elected from Bayana in Rajasthan.

 The investigation against Koli is still going on, the CBI said. More information has been sought from the Netherlands government on the extent of his involvement. Letters asking for details on the trafficking racket have been sent to Dutch authorities by the agency, which says the investigation is at a crucial stage.

 The accusation against Koli is that he helped the nine leave the country in February 2003 by forging documents to obtain visas from the Dutch embassy. Other than Koli, the agency booked 14 others in the case.

 Investigations show that Koli posed as a sitting MP before the embassy and used a forged letterhead. He allegedly claimed that the nine persons for whom he was seeking visas were members of the All India Koli Samaj. 

 Investigations revealed none of the nine belonged to the Koli community in Rajasthan. Instead, all were residents of Punjab. They disappeared after landing in Amsterdam.

 According to the CBI, several cases of government officials involved in human trafficking have come to light in recent years. 

 One such probe is on against the former director-general of the Indian Council of Cultural relations, Rakesh Kumar. 

 Another case involves CBIs own sub-inspector who was hand in glove with a travel agent who sent people abroad illegally. Sub-inspector Lilu Ram cheated people by promising them jobs abroad.

 Game in Indies, bargaining game in India

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI 

Mumbai, March 22: The India-Sri Lanka encounter will not be the only make-or-break tussle on Friday. Another battle will pit broadcasters who have been making a killing from the Cup against firms that pay for ads. 

 The win over Bermuda has cheered many, but the prospect of an early Indian exit still looms large. If the fears come true, ad rates could tumble faster than wickets.

 A spokesperson for Sony Entertainment Television (SET), which is beaming the Cup on cable, said there is no clause in its contracts to allow a mid-course rate revision. 

 But companies and media planners feel otherwise. There has to be a compromise. With channels mushrooming, broadcasters know if they dont relent, their share of the ad pie will land on someone elses plate, said a top executive of a leading media-planning firm. 

 Investing in big tournaments like World Cup Cricket is a bit like punting. And investing in cricket is like investing in the Indian stock market. 

 It may or may not return much to short-term investors, but in the long run, rewards will be good, says Manish Porwal of media firm Starcom.

 According to Porwal, another plan being considered by advertisers would lead to transfer of value on other ad-spots or event sponsorships. The suggestion is that firms that have paid high rates for matches where the TRPs fall suddenly might get ad spots at discounted prices during other popular programmes on the channel.

 Industry insiders say SET has scooped up Rs 400 crore so far, having sold around 90 per cent of its Cup ad spots. It expects another Rs 150 crore by flogging the 10 per cent it still has in mind at the last minute, probably at high rates. 

 But the calculations could go awry if Team India does not make it to Super Eight. Ten-second spots on the channel during India matches at that stage of the tournament have gone for Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh. 

 A cut to Rs 1 lakh isnt a remote possibility if India trips on Friday. The rates are Rs 1.25 to Rs 1.30 lakh for matches not featuring India. These could drop to less than Rs 1 lakh. 

 The hit to SET is estim-ated at Rs 150 crore if the Men in Blue eventually get the blues. For Nimbus, which feeds Doordarshan, the losses could be as high as Rs 25 crore.

 World Sport Nimbus Pte, a joint venture between Nimbus Communications and Singapores World Sport Group, acquired the satellite and terrestrial rights from the ICC in 2000 for two World Cup tournaments. 

 Nimbus, in turn, gave the satellite rights to SET, but retained the rights to feed terrestrial services TV (Doordarshan) watched by using an antenna. 

 With broadcasters facing the spectre of a 50-60 per cent drop in TRPs, the top advertisers the likes of Nokia, Hero Honda, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, LG, Videocon and Hutch could press for a reduction in ad rates by 20-30 per cent.

 Like cricket, this battle wont be over till the last ball on Friday.

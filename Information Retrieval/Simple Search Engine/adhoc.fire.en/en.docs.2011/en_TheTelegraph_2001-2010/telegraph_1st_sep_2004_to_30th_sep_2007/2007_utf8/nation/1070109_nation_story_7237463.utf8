 Shilpurr gets to Shilpa

 AMIT ROY

 Shilpa 

 London, Jan. 8: Shilpa Shetty has lost her temper with one of three newcomers to Celebrity Big Brother, the UK reality TV show in which the 31-year-old Bollywood star has been appearing since January 3. 

 The actress, who said she normally never quarrels with anyone, was nevertheless exceedingly cross with Jackiey Budden, a 48-year-old woman who, in the normal scheme of things, might struggle to get a job as Shilpas maidservant. 

 Jackieys claim to fame is she is the mother of 25-year-old Jade Goody, who came fourth in a Big Brother contest the normal version, not the celebrity adaptation in 2002. 

 Jade has entered Big Brother House with her mother and her boyfriend, Jack Tweedy, who is all of 19. While Shilpa gets on well enough with Jade and Jack, her relationship with Jackiey has been strained from the very start, January 5, when the new family entered the House. 

 She has also managed to get under the Bollywood stars skin through her inability or refusal to pronounce Shilpas name properly. 

 Its a game, cmon Big Brother is a game, she urged Shilpa whom she periodically calls Princess, apparently because the Indian name is too hard to pronounce. 

 It was pointless for Shilpa to assert: My names Shilpa. 

 Not Shilpurr. 

 Shill Per, please leave me or whatever your name is! hissed Jackiey. 

 Shilpa, all of 5ft 10in, eyed Jackiey the way she would an errant maidservant who had been caught doing naughty things with the cook behind memsahibs back: We havent finished. Yes, we have, responded Jackiey who stalked off and would not accept Shilpas peace offering of a glass of cold water. 

 Shilpa tried the Gandhian approach but Jackiey made it clear via her daughter that she was in no mood to be embraced. 

 Shes so aggressive, Shilpa complained. She doesnt have to go on and on and on and on and on please! Its taken the p.ss out of me. 

 Seven of the contestants are now acting as servants to Jade, her mother and boyfriend and their adopted family members, Shilpa and Jermaine. One of the five will be expelled live on Wednesday night.

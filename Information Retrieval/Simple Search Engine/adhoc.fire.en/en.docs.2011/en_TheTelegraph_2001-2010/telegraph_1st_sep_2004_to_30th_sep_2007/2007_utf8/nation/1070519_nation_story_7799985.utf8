 Verdict begins, minus Sanjay

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, May 18: Sentencing began today in the 14-year-old Mumbai blasts case with three-year terms for five arms couriers but no word yet on star convict Sanjay Dutt.

 Like the Bollywood actor, Yashwant Bhoinkar, Rashid Alware, Sharif Khan Adhikari and Abbas and Shahjahan Shaikhdare had been freed of charges under the anti-terror law Tada.

 They were convicted under the Customs Act for ferrying a cache of arms off-loaded on the Raigad coast in January-February 1993, but the court accepted they didnt know what they were carrying and were not conspirators.

 Alware and Adhikari have already spent three years and three months behind bars, which means they dont have to stay in jail any more. But the judge asked the five men to pay a fine of Rs 25,000 each, failing which their terms could be extended by six months.

 Defence lawyers Farhana Shah and Subhash Kanse pleaded that all five were poor and asked for a reduction of the fine, especially for Alware and Adhikari. 

 The three others have spent from one to two years in prison, and these periods will be deducted from their terms.

 All the 100 convicts were in court except an ailing Sanjay, whose fate could be known in another two weeks or so.

 We expect the sentencing process to continue for 10 to 15 days, special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said.

 Sanjay and three of his friends have applied for probation on the ground of good conduct, prompting another 70-odd accused to invoke the Probation of Offenders Act, meant primarily for first-time juvenile offenders.

 The court will decide these cases after considering reports from state government-appointed probation officers.

 Guwahati, April 28: Ulfas crack unit the 28 Battalion today suffered a major setback when police arrested its organising secretary, Ananta Gogoi, along with two others in the city. 

 A huge cache of arms and ammunition was seized from them. Police sources said the rebel leader was arrested while he was transporting the consignment from Dhopdhara in Goalpara to Tinsukia via Guwahati. 

 The arms are suspected to have been smuggled into the state from Bangladesh through the Garo hills in a Maruti van, which was intercepted at Jalukbari. 

 The other two arrested were identified as veteran Ulfa activist Deep Gogoi alias Rakhi Phukan and the vehicles driver, Moni Gowala. The police described Anantas arrest as a major success.

 The 37-year-old Ananta alias Sasanka Baruah is from Doomdooma and is a second lieutenant in Ulfa. Rakhi, 30, is said to be Anantas companion. 

 The seized arms and other items include two M-20 pistols, four magazines, eight Austrian-made hand grenades, 4 kg of RDX, 190 rounds of ammunition of AK-47 rifles, two time device switches, a remote-controlled explosive device, Rs 11,000 in cash, seven ransom and extortion notes and four cellphones.

 Relief call for martyr families

 MANAN KUMAR 

 New Delhi, Jan. 24: With more and more jawans falling to militant bullets, the Central Reserve Police Force has asked the Union home ministry to hike compensation for families of those killed in action to Rs 30 lakh.

 Under the existing system, families of personnel who die on duty get an insurance amount of Rs 5 lakh while those who die facing bullets get Rs 7.5 lakh besides other benefits like gratuity. The scheme, however, is voluntary and the premium is deducted from a jawans salary.

 However, under the new pension scheme, which covers those who joined the paramilitary force after January 1, 2004, the jawans are not entitled to gratuity, ex-gratia payment or insurance.

 The number of families who have lost young jawans but have not got any benefits has crossed 150 and is expected to increase with time, while the number of personnel without any insurance cover has crossed 70,000, said a senior CRPF officer.

 So it is only natural that jawans look for adequate compensation schemes in terrains where death can strike any moment. Lack of any insurance scheme, the officer underlined, is weaning jawans away from the paramilitary force besides affecting recruitment.

 Healthy and educated boys would rather join the army which gives them all the benefits besides less chances of getting killed, he added.

 The CRPF has also asked the ministry to give hardship allowance to its personnel on duty in Jammu and Kashmir and Naxalite-hit areas. Now, only paramilitary personnel serving in the Northeast get the allowance, which is 12.5 per cent of the basic salary. 

 With inflation rising, the force also wants revision of several allowances, such as tuition fees for children, and benefits for medal winners.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Shooter willing, not star-hit BJP 

 POORNIMA JOSHI

New Delhi, Jan. 4: Ace shooter Jaspal Rana wants to campaign for the BJP but the party is far from thrilled. Leaders say they are fed up with non-performing celebrities whom they see as ignorant and arrogant.

 The BJP is upset with actors Dharmendra, Hema Malini, Shatrughan Sinha and Vinod Khanna for continuing to neglect their political responsibilities. It has sent them letters of warning after they skipped the partys recent national council meeting.

 Other parties would sympathise. Actor and MP Govinda, for instance, gave the Congress a red face by never bothering to turn up at the Maharashtra flood victims side.

 Dharmendra has been a source of perennial embarrassment for the BJP. He never visits his constituency nor attends party functions. While Hema shows up in the Rajya Sabha now and then, Dharam has rarely been seen in the Lok Sabha where he was elected from Bikaner.

 Jaspal told The Telegraph he wanted to work for the party in the run-up to the elections in four states, including his home state Uttaranchal.

 Its not for me to say if I should contest the Assembly elections from Dehra Dun or Mussoorie. I will do what the party tells me, he said.

 The shooters father Narayan Singh Rana, a former Uttaranchal minister, seems to feel that by campaigning for the BJP, Jaspal can bargain for a Rajya Sabha seat.

 Senior BJP leaders agree that Jaspal would be a star attraction but are not sure about the nature of his engagement. Should he contest or should he campaign?

 What worsens the dilemma is that the shooter is related to the BJP president, his sister being married to Rajnath Singhs son. But Rajnath doesnt want to favour his relative too much.

 The problem, says political sociologist Imtiaz Ahmad, is a fallout of Indias political process getting detached from the electorate.

 Short of leaders with a sustained relationship with the people, the parties see in the celebrities a quick-fix solution to the problem of finding candidates with mass appeal.

 But werent J. Jayalalithaa, M.G. Ramachandran and M. Karunanidhi big movie stars? Such exceptions, a senior BJP leader explained, are restricted to southern India.

 In the south, politicians are larger than life and film stars fit the bill. But up north and elsewhere, most celebrities and actors tend to be and I am being kind here ignorant, inefficient and arrogant, he said.

 During last years Bihar elections, Janata Dal (United) president Sharad Yadav threatened the BJP that if it got its nautanki mandali (theatre troupe) to campaign, he would sit on a dharna at the airport.

 This led to all the actors, including Bihar MP Shatrughan Sinha, being kept at arms length during the campaign.

 These actors come with their entire troupe and throw tantrums. We were happier without them, a senior leader told this correspondent.

 Shatrughan has his own bit to add to the tale.

 Let me tell you a secret, he said. They (the stars) join the ruling party or the party that is expected to win. They already have enough glamour and stardom. What they seek is the glamour of power. Woh seva karne nahin, mewa khane aate hain (They come not to serve the people but to enjoy the power).

 He spoke of himself as an exception, even though the BJP had removed him from the health ministry because of his failure to perform. I have no ulterior motives. I just want to serve the people, he said.

 MLA loses Indian label

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Sept. 3: A Bihar MLAs name has been struck off the voter list because she could not show documents to prove she is an Indian citizen.

 Sitamarhi subdivisional officer Bharat Jha said Nagina Devi, Lok Janshakti Party legislator from Bathnaha, could not be considered an Indian just because she had married one.

 Under Section 5 of the Indian Citizenship Act, being married to an Indian does not automatically qualify one as an Indian citizen.

 Nagina Devi, a Nepalese by birth, had married Jogiraj Prasad of Sitamarhi in 1972 and has been living here since then. The legislator failed to produce documentary evidence to prove her citizenship. I ordered her name removed from the voter list last Friday, Jha said. 

 He added that the MLA had been asked to explain how her name had figured on the voters list.

 Nagina Devis name had first appeared on the list for Sitamarhi in 1995.

 Jha said she told officials she was born in 1958 at her grandmothers house at Bhagwanpur in Bathnaha and, hence, was an Indian on the basis of her birth. 

 The matter was first brought to the administrations notice in May after a home ministry report questioned Nagina Devis Indian citizenship. The report followed a complaint by a political leader. The MLA said she was asked to appear before the SDO on August 24. 

 But the entire administration was busy with a function on that day. I was ready with my lawyer and documents but was not heard. How could the SDO pass the order on August 24 itself without giving me a hearing?

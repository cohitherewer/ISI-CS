 Amar presents judge fixer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 4: Amar Singh today called the media and handed over to police a man who had allegedly claimed he could fix things with a Supreme Court judge.

 The Samajwadi Party general secretary told journalists the man had been calling and meeting him, claiming to be a senior law officer and implying he was a go-between for a now-retired Supreme Court judge.

 The man, who identified himself as B.K. Verma, wanted Rs 5 crore, Amar said. He offered to ensure that Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav would be let off in a corruption case.

 Justice A.R. Lakshmanan had headed the Supreme Court bench that ordered a preliminary CBI probe into a complaint that Mulayam and his family possessed assets disproportionate to their income.

 But while hearing a review petition on the order on March 16, the judge had almost broken down in court over a heinous letter he had received and withdrawn from the case. 

 The anonymous letter is believed to have alleged that the judge would pass an order in favour of Mulayam.

 The judge retired the same month and was last week appointed chairman of the Law Commission.

 By questioning the law officer, Amar said, he had gathered that the man had no idea that Justice Lakshmanan now headed the commission. It is not clear if the man knew the judge had retired.

 Today, Verma came to collect the first instalment of Rs 1 crore from Amar at his Delhi home. The Samajwadi leader offered him tea and engaged him in small talk while he called the police and the media.

 The Samajwadi leader, who had a few months ago been enmeshed in a CD scandal with his purported phone conversations being made public, said he had acted with caution. When Verma first approached him three or four months ago, he had dismissed him.

 When the man persisted in calling him, the Samajwadi leader met him with a lawyer posing as a relative. The lawyer told Amar he had no tangible proof against the man.

 Verma said he could fix a meeting between Amar and a brother-in-law of the judge. He also met Amar in hospital when the politician was being treated for a kidney ailment.

 A few days ago, when he visited Amar again, the Samajwadi leader agreed to give him Rs 1 crore and prepared to trap him.

 Verma was taken away from Amars home by the Delhi police special branch. Sources said he insisted he was a Supreme Court official.

 The man also alleged that Amar had demanded money from him to fix a business deal, and that this had led to an argument.

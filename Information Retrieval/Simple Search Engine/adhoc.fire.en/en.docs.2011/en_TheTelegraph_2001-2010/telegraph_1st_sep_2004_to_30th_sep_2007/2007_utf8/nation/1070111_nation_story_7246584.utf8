 Permit for Delhi park weddings

 New Delhi, Jan. 10 (PTI): The state consumer commission has clarified an earlier restraining order on the booking of parks, gardens and public places for marriage functions by saying such functions will be allowed for one month. 

 In its earlier order, all civic authorities were ordered not to allow such functions in parks and gardens and at public places in Delhi. 

 The commission yesterday said since we have given one months time to the New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) for compliance of our directions, we clarify through this order that the NDMC shall permit taking place of marriages.

 Justice J.D. Kapoor, who heads the commission, directed the civic authorities, including DDA and MCD, to allow such functions after obtaining an undertaking from the persons who had booked such public places that they would maintain cleanliness. 

 The interim order came on a petition of S.K. Lamba who was told by the NDMC that in pursuance of the commissions order, his booking of Talkatora Garden for the marriage of his daughter stood cancelled. 

 Earlier, the commission had imposed an exemplary fine of Rs 25 lakh on NDMC after taking strong note of the poor maintenance of parks, gardens and public places in the city and restrained all civic authorities from allowing their use for private functions.

 The commission, disposing of a complaint filed by Talkatora Garden Morning Walkers Association alleging poor upkeep of Talkatora Garden, had directed that Rs 5 lakh of the total fine be recovered from the NDMC chairperson and the director of its horticulture department.

 Justice Kapoor had observed: It is high time that these functionaries should be taught a lesson and told their duties and functions towards the public as well as public institutions as such authorities and persons at the helm of affairs consider that they are not accountable to anybody as to their inaction or remissness... towards public.

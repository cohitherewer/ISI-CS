 Dowry push kills fiancee

 New Delhi, April 29 (PTI): A youth allegedly pushed his fiancee to death from the terrace of her house just two days before their marriage after a scuffle over dowry.

 Deepak Bahal, 24, and his father Rakesh Bahal were arrested today under the Dowry (Prohibition) Act for killing 22-year-old Mukta Singh after her brother filed a complaint, police said. 

 Deepak also faces murder charges.

 The couple, residents of Karol Bagh in Delhi, were to be married tomorrow.

 The youth, along with his parents, had gone to Muktas house yesterday when the two families had an argument over dowry. 

 Deepak took Mukta to the terrace to sort out the matter. 

 But the argument between the two took a fatal turn when Deepak, in a fit of anger, allegedly pushed Mukta from the fifth floor, resulting in her death, the police said. 

 Mukta was taken to a nearby hospital where she was declared brought dead.

 Sanjay sentence knocks

 Mumbai, July 16: The stalled sentencing in the 1993 blasts is expected to resume tomorrow after the special anti-terror court today rejected a plea for a stay.

 The court has awarded sentences to 76 of the 100 convicted in the case. The remaining 24 include four members of prime accused Tiger Memons family, besides Sanjay Dutt and his three friends.

 Dutt was present in court when judge Pramod Kode threw out the defence plea. The actor, waiting for a verdict on his probation application, has been summoned on July 21. It is, however, unclear if the court will give a decision on his application that day.

 Sixteen convicts had filed a petition questioning the validity of the anti-terror law (Tada) on June 18. Kode rejected the plea last week. The defence then filed an application, demanding a stay on the sentencing until they could challenge the decision in the Supreme Court. But Kode today turned down that plea, too.

 The Supreme Court has upheld the validity of Tada (in earlier orders), and if the validity needs to be challenged, it can be done while filing an appeal against the judgment (by the accused), Kode said.

 The court issued summons to eight convicts to appear tomorrow. They include bomb planters Mohammed Shoaib Ghansar, Asgar Mukadam, Abdul Gani Turk, Parvez Shaikh, Shahnawaz Qureshi, Mustaq Tarani, Nasim Bharmare and Imtiaz Ghavate. Dismissed customs official Somnath Thapa has also been asked to be present.

 While the bomb planters are likely to get death for their conviction under multiple anti-terror act charges and Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, Thapa stares at life imprisonment for allegedly facilitating RDX landings on the Raigad coast.

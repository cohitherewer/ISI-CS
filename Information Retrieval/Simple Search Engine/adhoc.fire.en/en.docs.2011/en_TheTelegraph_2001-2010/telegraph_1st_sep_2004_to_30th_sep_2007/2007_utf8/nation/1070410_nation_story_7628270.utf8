 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Official seal on masters prose

 M. Karunanidhi, it has long been recognised, has a way with words. But now, the chief ministers take on ancient Tamil classic Thirukkural, a compilation of 1,330 couplets by Thiruvalluvar, seems to have got the governments seal.

 The revelation was made last week when agriculture minister Veerapandi S. Arumugam placed the demand for grants related to his ministry on the Assembly table. 

 He prefaced government policy with a Thirukkural couplet, explaining how agriculture was the essence of life. The poetry was followed by a simple explanation for the lay reader. It is here that the hand of the DMK patriarch, long known for his finesse with film scripts, came into play. The explanation was taken straight from an old commentary Karunanidhi had written on the poem.

 The chief ministers words received the stamp of authority, to be kept for posterity. The papers will be part of the archives in the Assembly. Immortal lines? Well, almost, except that the minister who carried out the copy-paste job could have looked for other sources of inspiration.

 Fame beyond software

 Hyderabad, long known for its software shine, is poised for a DNA distinction.

 The Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, a central government institution, is planning a new cell to identify victims of trains accidents, air crashes and earthquakes with DNA profiling. 

 The cell will help authorities identify bodies and ensure that compensation is given to genuine relatives. It will be of great help in settling claims, said N. Madhusudhan Reddy, a scientist at the centre. DNA profiling hasnt been used often in Andhra Pradesh, except in the 2005 Nalgonda train accident.

 A single DNA sample and another one from the family is enough to identify a victim. Even combs or razors used can lead to a result. 

 The centre is planning a DNA training academy, where rail rescue teams, emergency workers, insurance companies, judicial officers and forensic scientists will be coached in the basics of the science.

 Road alert flashed

 It takes a court nudge for civic authorities to realise that citizens paying taxes deserve more than potholes.

 Bombay High Court asked the municipal corporation of Greater Mumbai and other civic bodies to inform a court- appointed panel about the steps they have taken to ensure that there are roads in the city not a series of craters waiting to trip people.

 You collect a fee to issue a driving licence, so you must see to it that roads are worth driving on.... These are co-related, the judges said. The authorities have to reply in two weeks.

 Last August, the court had ordered the Greater Mumbai corporation, the Bombay Port Trust, Thane civic authorities and others to fill potholes within 15 days. 

 Later, it formed a panel, headed by former police commissioner Ronny Mendonca, to submit quarterly reports on the condition of roads.

 Class of four

 How old should kids be for school? At least four, says a committee that handed in its report to the Delhi government in recent weeks.

 Now, Delhi High Court wants to know how soon state authorities can enforce the proposal. The committee, headed by CBSE chairman Ashok Ganguly, also suggested that schools limit the pre-nursery stage to a year, instead of two. 

 The court was hearing a petition filed by an NGO that wanted the idea put into practice within a week. The judges, told that admissions for this year are over in most schools, said the suggestion could be followed from the next academic year.

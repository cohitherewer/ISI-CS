 Left demands freeze statement 

- Centre toils on N-truce draft 

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Aug. 29: The UPA was tonight toiling over the draft of a conciliatory statement after the Left insisted that the announcement of a committee to study the nuclear deal should be accompanied by an assurance that the agreement is on hold.

 The drafting is essentially an exercise in reconciling extremities: Manmohan Singhs government wants no hurdles in operationalising the deal while the Left has given it a pause or delete option.

 The statement will be a political one and not an assurance or resolution made in Parliament. The contours of the statement were first discussed at a meeting the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi had with Pranab Mukherjee and Ahmed Patel this morning in Parliament. 

 Sources said the trickiest area was accommodating the Lefts demand without giving an impression that the deal was frozen.

 Highly placed Congress sources conceded tonight that the Left demand for a statement was a new headache.

 Before setting up the committee to discuss the differences, the government must come out with a public statement that the agreement has been withheld, Forward Bloc general secretary Debabrata Biswas said after a Left meeting.

 Earlier, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said: Till the mechanism or a committee comes out with its findings, the government should not proceed with operationalising the agreement.

 Before the Left Front meeting, Yechury called on Mukherjee and discussed the proposed statement. Left sources said Mukherjee assured Yechury that the government did not intend discussing the India-specific safeguards agreement in the September meeting of the IAEA.

 When Yechury briefed representatives of the other Left constituents, they insisted the assurance should be enshrined in a statement.

 It is learnt that the statement, expected to be released jointly by the UPA and the Left if the settlement goes according to plan, would stress on the governments commitment to uphold Indias sovereignty in pursuit of its foreign policy.

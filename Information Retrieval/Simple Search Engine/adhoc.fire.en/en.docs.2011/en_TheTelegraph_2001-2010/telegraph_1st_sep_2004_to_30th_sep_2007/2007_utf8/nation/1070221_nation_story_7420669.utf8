The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Terror victims that BJP forgot

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: Steeped in what they call the cultural essence of their ideology, all senior BJP leaders are sticklers for rituals of any kind.

 They dutifully attend marriages and engagements, promptly offer condolences and are almost always the first to visit victims of any tragedy.

 Yet no senior BJP leader has cared to visit the Samjhauta Express victims or their families.

 Not Atal Bihari Vajpayee, not party president Rajnath Singh. L.K. Advani (in picture), usually the most serious about such visits, did not make the trip from his Prithviraj Road residence to Safdarjung Hospital, less than 5 km away.

 After the 2003 Mumbai bombings, Advani had been one of the first politicians to visit the blast site at the Gateway of India and enquire after the injured at JJ Hospital. After last Julys train mayhem, he was again quick to visit the injured at King Edward Hospital.

 Is the BJP not interested this time because most of the identified victims happen to be Muslims from Pakistan?

 Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi bristled at the question. What do you mean, no senior leader visited the victims? I went to the (blast) site today, so did Vijay Kumar Malhotra and Sahib Singh. The BJP president has formed a three-member team to inquire into the tragedy.

 Rajnaths public show of concern has so far been limited to an attack on the Centres soft policy on terror at a news conference yesterday.

 Malhotra, too, returned from the spot this afternoon only to launch a tirade against the government for being soft on terror. He spoke hardly a word on the victims or the trauma of their families.

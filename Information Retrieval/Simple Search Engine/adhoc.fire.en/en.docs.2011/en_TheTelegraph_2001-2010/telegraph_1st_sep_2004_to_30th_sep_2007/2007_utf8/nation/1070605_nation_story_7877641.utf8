 New Delhi, June 4: What was meant to be a show of solidarity with kinsmen across the border has turned into a groundswell.

 When the Gujjars of Delhi called a bandh today to protest the high-handedness against their brethren in Rajasthan, it led to stirrings in a caste that has largely remained untouched by post-Mandal politics in north India.

 Almost overnight, it seemed every Gujjar in the national capital region spoke of being short-changed and ignored by successive governments despite being one of the Other Backward Classes.

 The Gujjars feel their political representatives Sachin Pilot, Avatar Singh Bhadana and Ramesh Biduri are either being led by protesters or ignored. 

 We have suffered every misery inflicted with a smile. We are happy with the little money we earn selling milk or doing small businesses. But even a worm turns if it is provoked again and again, said Ram Vir Singh Bidhuri, an NCP MLA from Badarpur, on the southern fringes of the capital.

 The legislator asserted that Gujjars outside Rajasthan do not want Scheduled Tribe status. 

 We have nothing to do with the reservation demand, but we feel Vasundhara Raje should not have promised something before the elections and gone back on it after getting the Gujjar votes, said Naseeb Singh, the Congress MLA from Ghazipur on the Delhi-Ghaziabad highway.

 Pointing to this mornings arson on the highway not far from his home, Singh spoke of how the Gujjar agitation has gathered strength. I do not have caste or religious biases. In any case, this agitation doesnt need political leaders because it has a lot of popular support.

 Others leaders are unhappy with their own parties. The trouble with my party is it doesnt know where to look, left or right. Our silence will devour us, said a Congress Gujjar leader. 

 He wondered why the Centre was not coming down strongly against the Vasundhara Raje regime or why Congress leaders not even former chief minister Ashok Gehlot have not visited the trouble spots in Rajasthan.

 His fear is the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party will expand their base in Rajasthan if the Congress and the BJP are undecided on which caste to court. 

 There are reports that the BSP would try to win over the Meenas, the states dominant tribals, and build a Dalit-tribal vote-bank that could make the party a key player in a state where power has stayed with the BJP or the Congress.

 The Samajwadi Party, unfazed by its recent reverses in Uttar Pradesh, has already taken up the cudgels for the Gujjars with an eye on consolidating its coalition of backward castes.

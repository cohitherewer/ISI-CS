 Sermon from Speaker 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 26: Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today warned of serious implications if the judiciary assumes the responsibility of governance.

 Chatterjee counselled the judiciary to remind itself that its task does not include an amorphous supervision of the government. But he also asked MPs not to cast aspersions on the judiciary.

 He was delivering the K.N. Katju memorial lecture on the Separation of Powers under the Constitution and Judicial Activism.

 The contention that the judiciary should take on itself the onerous responsibility of the governance of the country, in matters which the Constitution has imposed on either the executive or legislature, has serious implications.

 In a democracy, the executive authority must be and is accountable to the people, he said, and asked whether the judiciary was accountable to anyone if it interfered with the policy decisions of the executive and took decisions of a clearly administrative nature.

 The responsibility of managing public affairs should be left to those mandated by the Constitution because this accountability is what differentiates democracy from other systems of governance, he said.

 The lines separating the different organs of the state were getting blurred, Chatterjee said, as a section of the judiciary seems to be of the view that it has authority by way of what is described as judicial activism to exercise powers which are earmarked by the Constitution for the legislature or the executive.

 The Speaker referred to the large number of cases piling up in courts for a hearing and asked: Now, in such a case, can any other organ of the state take upon itself the right to exercise judicial powers on the plea that the judiciary has not adequately been able to do so? Obviously neither the legislature nor the executive can do so because it has no such power under the Constitution.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Qaida hoax

 Imphal, Aug. 20: A group of Myanmarese, who were thought to be al Qaida militants in Manipur till yesterday, have turned out to be labourers, reports our correspondent.

 The suspense ended today when Assam Rifles turned over 15 Myanmarese trespassers to police and clarified that none of them was a terrorist.

 All were detained in Moreh, known for international border trade, on Friday for entering Manipur without valid identity documents. The Assam Rifles had suspected them of having links with militant outfits but did not find any reason to press charges after interrogating them.

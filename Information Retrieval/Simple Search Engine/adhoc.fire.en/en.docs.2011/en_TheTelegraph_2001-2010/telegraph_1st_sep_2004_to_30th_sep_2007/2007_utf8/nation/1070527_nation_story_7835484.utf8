 Chennai, May 26: The induction of DMK chief M. Karunanidhis daughter Kanimozhi into politics got a formal seal today when she was nominated to a Rajya Sabha seat.

 The candidature of 38-year-old Kanimozhi, a postgraduate and a poet, was announced by her father in a packed news conference at the DMK headquarters tonight. The Tamil Nadu chief minister addressed the media after a meeting of the partys high-level policy planning body.

 Biennial elections to the Upper House are due on June 15 to fill up six vacancies.

 The other DMK candidate in the fray is Trichy N. Siva, a supporter of Karunanidhis son M.K. Stalin. The DMK will share two other seats with its allies, the Congress and the CPI, Karunanidhi said. 

 The Opposition ADMK is in a comfortable position. With 61 MLAs and the support of six MDMK legislators, it can easily field two candidates who can be elected unopposed.

 Kanimozhis ascension to national politics comes close on the heels of a grim dynastic battle in the DMK. The face-off between Karunanidhis family and the Maran brothers, his grand nephews, had led to the resignation of former Union IT and telecommunication minister Dayanidhi Maran.

 With Kanimozhi set to go to Delhi, the DMK is hoping she will replace Dayanidhi as the partys new, young face in the capital. 

 Stalin was present at the news conference today, along with DMK leaders T.R. Baalu and K. Anbazhagan.

 The chief ministers daughter has been pleading for more women in the DMK, both in the state and at the Centre. 

 Todays announcement had some drawing parallels between Kanimozhi and Jayalalithaa. The ADMK chief, too, had entered the Rajya Sabha first in the 1980s when her mentor MGR brought her into politics.

 Asked why he chose to give Kanimozhi the Rajya Sabha ticket this time, Karunanidhi said: The very fact that she has already stepped into politics is the reason. But he ruled out any cabinet position for his daughter now.

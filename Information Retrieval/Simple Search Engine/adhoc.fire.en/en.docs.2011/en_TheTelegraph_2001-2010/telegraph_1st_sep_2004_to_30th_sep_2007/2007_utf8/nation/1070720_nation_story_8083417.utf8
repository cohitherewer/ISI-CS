 New Delhi, July 19: A session on the veena and a long walk through the expansive Mughal Gardens marked the start of A.P.J. Abdul Kalams morning on the day Parliament voted for his successor just a kilometre from Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

 On July 24, Kalam will vacate the presidential palace but the day when the final dice was cast in the battle for Rashtrapati Bhavans new occupant passed in unusual quietness for the technocrat. 

 According to the Presidents confidants, Kalam spent his morning at home. 

 He did not want to venture out of Rashtrapati Bhavan while the voting was on, explained a source in the Presidents secretariat. 

 Kalam walks in the gardens every morning. Today though, the walk extended to a full hour. 

 Normally he walks for half an hour or so. Todays was longer, an employee working in the housekeeping department said. 

 And he did not have many visitors. Unlike other days, only two or three people visited him (till early evening), she said. 

 Stationed within the presidential complex, Kalams secretariat had a day like any other. 

 Officials were busy studying a pile of complaints under the Right to Information Act which had just arrived in the morning. 

 Kalam prides himself on his promptness in responding to any citizens questions whether through email or by letter, and any slip-up by his secretariat in his last few days would probably receive a frown. 

 If the Presidents day was surprisingly quiet, the flurry of VIP Ambassadors entering Parliament kept the CRPF jawans guarding the House on their toes. 

 On any other day of Parliament, when they are supposed to be working, most of them dont turn up. But today, theyve come in hordes, complained constable Rajender Singh. 

 Kalams most likely successor UPA-Left presidential nominee Pratibha Patil chose to stay veiled behind a tight cordon of security officials guarding her South Avenue residence. 

 Reporters were told madam wouldnt be making any appearance through the morning. And she will only speak to the public after the election results are declared, a woman aide said.

 Child worker black spot on Bengal

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 

New Delhi, Sept. 16: Four thousand one hundred and fifty-three violations; three convictions.

 Bengals ruling communists, who claim to represent the downtrodden, seem hardly bothered about justice for child workers though the law forbids anyone from hiring children below 14 whether in homes, eateries or factories.

 According to a report prepared by the labour ministry, the state has prosecuted and convicted fewer exploiters of child labour than most other states. 

 In contrast, states where child labour has been endemic like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have made a turnaround.

 Over 20 years after India made employing children a punishable offence under the Child Labour Act of 1986, Bengal has seen only three convictions. 

 Even a small state like Goa has had seven convictions.

 Activists said Bengals dismal figure of 79 prosecutions launched in over 4,000 cases suggests lack of intent.

 A poor conviction rate can occur because of genuine problems cases may run into, but nothing stops the authorities from at least prosecuting the accused, said Kailash Satyarthi, a campaigner against child labour. 

 State labour department officials, however, pointed to the over 90,000 investigations they have launched. If there was lack of intent on our part, there would not have been such a high number of inspections into alleged cases of child labour, an official said. 

 Unlike several other states, industrial child labour in Bengal is restricted to a few areas, the official said.

 Child labour is mainly in two forms here domestic labour, but more than that, agricultural labour.

 Although agriculture in itself does not find a mention on the list of hazardous occupations banned for children under 14, work involving use of pesticides, insecticides or chemicals is proscribed. Often, the hazardous work in agriculture is hard to distinguish, the official said. 

 Activists and officials of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights call the explanation an excuse. 

 States that have achieved some success have shown that the approach needed is one where all possible cases are investigated. If you target all children in agriculture, you will identify those who are in hazardous work, its chairperson Shanta Sinha said.

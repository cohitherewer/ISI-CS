 Nitish goes easy on land

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nitish

 Patna, April 9: Wary after the Nandigram bloodspill, Nitish Kumar today said the Bihar government would not forcibly acquire land for industrial development.

 The government will not repeat a Nandigram in Bihar by forcibly acquiring land for industrial development. The industries will come up only on plots that the people will give of their own will and volition, the chief minister said. 

 His clarification follows a Patna High Court order on Friday directing the state not to use force to displace the landowners for setting up industries.

 The courts order came in response to a PIL filed by a farmers union against a move by the railways to acquire land for a wagon repairing workshop. 

 It shattered railway minister Lalu Prasads dream project with the court also issuing a notice to the railway authorities to clarify the process to be adopted for land acquisition. 

 Lalu Prasad, who represents Chhapra in the Lok Sabha, had announced the setting up of a wagon repairing workshop soon after becoming the railway minister. 

 Over 100 acres of mostly fertile agriculture land was identified for the purpose in 2005.

 The farmers petition claimed that the land belonged to the Ismailchak, Govindpur, Chakapsaid and Chitranjanpur villages under Sonepur block.

 It said the villagers, who had formed the Bhumi Bachao Kisan Sangharsh Samiti to fight the acquisition process, were fighting tooth and nail against the railways move to take away their land.

 The high courts order, coupled with the turmoil triggered by the police firing in Nandigram that left at least 14 people dead, is believed to be the reason behind the chief minister lowering his pitch on land acquisition for industrialisation.

 The problem of unemployment can be taken care of only through industrialisation. But the government will not use coercive methods for acquisition of land. 

 After all, the government is just the manifestation of the wishes of the people and lives for the cause of the people, Nitish said.

 What seems to have compelled the chief minister, who earned accolades from the Tatas and many other global industrial houses for promising them land and atmosphere for investment, is the fact that his governments amended land acquisition policy, too, has failed to cut ice with farmers.

 The amended land acquisition and rehabilitation policy in February had envisaged the payment of 50 per cent more than the market price, besides a 30 to 60 per cent of compensation, to the landowners giving away their land for industrialisation.

 Heat cloud on Gandhi death

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Ramchandra Gandhi

 New Delhi, June 13: Ramchandra Gandhi, a grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, was today found dead in his room at the India International Centre (IIC) where he had checked in to escape the heat. 

 The older brother of Bengal governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, Ramchandra is believed to have died in the early hours of this morning, apparently of natural causes. His body was found sprawled on the floor, arms spread out.

 A renowned teacher, philosopher and author, Ramchandra lived alone in a small apartment without air conditioning on the top floor of a bungalow near central Delhis Bengali Market.

 He called us on June 9 seeking accommodation. He checked in with us the next day, a senior IIC official said. 

 Every summer for the past several years, when the heat peaks, he has been coming and staying with us here. 

 Ramchandra, 70, had spent most of yesterday in room number 15 and ventured out for a stroll only late in the evening, IIC officials said. Even his food was ordered from his room. 

 This morning, he did not call for his morning cup of tea and repeated knocks on his door first by the cleaning staff and then senior IIC officials went unheard.

 Finally, the IIC staff broke open the door and Mr Gandhi was lying on the floor, arms spread out. The room was locked from inside, so there does not appear to be any foul play, the deputy commissioner of police, Anand Mohan, said. 

 The IIC staff took Ramchandra to the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, where he was declared dead. The body has been sent to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences for post-mortem. 

 An IIC regular, Ramchandra was often seen reading, sitting by himself in a corner of the elite South Delhi clubs lawns. 

 His father, Devdas Gandhi, was the youngest of the Mahatmas four sons. Mother Laxmi was the daughter of C. Rajagopalachari who followed Lord Mountbatten as Governor General of independent India. 

 Devdas and Laxmi had four children a daughter, Tara, and sons Rajmohan, Ramchandra and Gopalkrishna. Rajmohan is also a historian and author. 

 Ramchandras only daughter, Leela, teaches English and Cultural Theory at Melbourne s La Troube University. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condoled his death, saying he was a distinguished philosopher and devoted teacher.

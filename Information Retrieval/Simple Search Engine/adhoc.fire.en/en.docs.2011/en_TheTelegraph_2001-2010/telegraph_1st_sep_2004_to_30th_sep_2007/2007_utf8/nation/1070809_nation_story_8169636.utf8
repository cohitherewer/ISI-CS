The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 IIM chief selection as before, says Delhi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: The new directors of three Indian Institutes of Management will be selected the same way as their predecessors, the Centre said today, as the IIM Ahmedabad chief denied he had complained of interference.

 At an IIMA workshop yesterday, Bakul Dholakia was reported to have lashed out at the Union HRD ministrys decision to invite applications for the post of director through a newspaper advertisement. This was an infringement of the IIMs autonomy, he was quoted as saying.

 Dholakia today said he had been misquoted.

 Apart from Dholakia, IIM Bangalore director Prakash Apte and his IIM Calcutta counterpart Shekhar Chaudhari are about to complete their five-year tenure. 

 A search-cum-selection committee, consisting of eminent academicians, independently considers each application for the post of an IIM director, the HRD ministry said today. 

 As a matter of fact, each one of the present incumbents to the post of directors of the IIMs had also been selected by the same process, a ministry statement said.

 IIM chiefs like directors or vice-chancellors of all autonomous institutes are finally selected by the appointment committee of the cabinet (ACC) through a standard procedure laid out by the department of personnel and training.

 Veteran IIM administrators have told The Telegraph that the appointment committee usually accepts the recommendations of the search-cum-selection committee. 

 The search-cum-selection committee members are generally aware of the Centres likes and dislikes. The names they filter out and send to the Centre are generally acceptable to the ACC, a former IIM Bangalore director said.

 Dholakia said he was not against the advertisement, as a consultative process would be followed, which is what we wanted.

 He added that the governments decision to invite applications was a procedural requirement, which does not preclude nomination.

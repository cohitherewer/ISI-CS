 Back-bench murmurs against Amar 

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Amar: Under attack

 Lucknow, May 13: Amar Singh made a quiet exit from the now-disbanded Uttar Pradesh Development Council last night but not before stirring a debate in the Samajwadi Party on whether he played a role in the poll debacle.

 Mulayam Singh Yadav cited excesses by the Election Commission as the primary reason for the defeat but murmurs did rise from the back benches on how the party deviated from its avowed policy of socialism and was perceived to be too close to a group of industrialists.

 This is being seen as a reference to what has come to be known in Lucknow as friends of Amar, who include industrialist Anil Ambani and Saharas Subroto Roy. 

 At a meeting of the newly elected MLAs of the Samajwadi party last night, a group said many dependable leaders were driven out of the party or sidelined by the new power centre.

 The group cited the examples of Gyanendra Mishra, a staunch Lohiaite; Raj Babbar, the actor who fell out with Amar and Mulayam; and Beni Prasad Verma, a Kurmi leader whose walkout cost the party dear.

 We are preparing our own assessment report on the partys poor showing. We will submit it to Mulayam at the next meeting of the partys legislature body, a senior Samajwadi Party leader said. 

 We are still loyal to him but we would like him to take a look at the report before he gets down to the job of strengthening the organisation, said an MLA from western Uttar Pradesh. Some MLAs also want to assess whether Amars involvement in key decisions, the controversies surrounding him and the association of the party with film stars contributed to alienation of voters. 

 The ginger group is apparently emboldened by reactions from those who used to be close to Mulayam before the rise of Amar. The Samajwadi Party underwent a change in class character in recent years since the emergence of the Amar Singh phenomenon, said K.C. Tyagi, a former MP and one-time Mulayam aide.

 Tyagi had left the party in the late nineties in protest against the pre-eminence of Amar and joined the Janata Dal (United). 

 Tyagi and Beni Prasad Verma had played a key role in laying the groundwork that eventually helped the Samajwadi Party come to power in Uttar Pradesh.

 However, Amar chose to ignore the whispers and did not make any statement on the partys performance. 

 He is not keeping well. He was here for a while to tender his resignation from the development council, a party source said.

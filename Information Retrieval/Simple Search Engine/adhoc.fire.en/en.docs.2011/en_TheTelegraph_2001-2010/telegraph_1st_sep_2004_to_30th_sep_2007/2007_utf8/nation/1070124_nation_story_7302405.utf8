 Net route to missing kids

 ANANYA SENGUPTA 

 Kalpit Chandwar will have turned 15 now, but his parents havent seen him for the past eight years

 Ravi Vishwakarma was 10 when he left for school, never to return. Its been five years since 

 Samiksha Gupta never came home from a neighbours house in Delhi. The three-year-old is missing for four years

 Police reports put the number of missing children at 7,000 in Andhra Pradesh and over 3,000 in Mumbai over the past year. In Bengal, the figure is 1,000 people, most of them children. The runaways every year number over a million

 Mumbai, Jan. 23: The problem is huge, but not pressing enough to get funds for an NGO-run website that helps trace kids. Systems engineer Anuj Bhargava set up National Centre for Missing Children with his MBA wife Nidhi on November 14, 2000. Little government help has come his way since. Even corporate sponsors appear to be fighting shy.

 The NGO runs missingindiankids.com, Indias first website meant to help law enforcement agencies, families and organisations searching for the missing. 

 Not everyone can afford the search for the missing. Some spend their lifes savings. Many have to give up because of the high costs. We get no help from sponsors because no one wants to be involved. But how long can we pay out of our own pockets to sustain the site? We have approached the Centre, but to no avail, says Bhargava.

 Its easy to track a missing child on the site. The missing children section is divided into five zones: north, east, west, central and south. All details a photograph, identification marks, age, height, complexion, clothes last worn are available. A poster, which can be printed on standard paper, is also there.

 Those who want to help (volunteers) merely need to take printouts of the poster and put them up in public places. Parents who wish to register for a missing child can download a free form from the site. 

 Ayush Bajaj is one of the missing kids listed on the site. The 10-year-old from Calcutta went missing in 1991. A shy kid, Ayush never mingled with strangers. But when he went out to play on that fateful day, he never came back.

 Bhargava still hopes help will come his way. I wish the media came forward to help us. Can you imagine how successful we could be if every daily in the country publishes one picture of these missing children daily? We have achieved success. With more help, we could have helped many more of them.

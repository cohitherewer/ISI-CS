 Corus carnival in works

 - Takeover kickoff for Tata centenary celebrations 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jamshedpur, Feb. 2: The Corus takeover has fired up the spirits of Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman, who had promised grand centenary celebrations this year.

 Addressing a news conference after his return from Mumbai, Muthuraman said the preparations for the centenary year celebrations would begin now and announcements would be made soon.

 Though a committee including him and senior officials was formed to decide the celebration line-up some time ago, the managing director said, he was not really interested in the proceedings. 

 In fact, I skipped several meetings and I soon wrapped up the ones I attended as I felt there was something missing in order to actually get into a celebratory mood. This actually irritated my other colleagues, who were shocked at my disinterest in the celebrations, Muthuraman said.

 But with the Corus deal, the right centenary gift, things have changed. This is the right time to celebrate, he said, adding that the events would be something the residents of Jamshedpur would love to remember and recount.

 At the news conference, Muthuraman said the takeover has put Jamshedpur firmly on the world map. Earlier, too, the steel city was popular in international circles. 

 But now, those in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom would be well acquainted with the city, he said. 

 It was a matter of great pride for Jamshedpur as this deal is the largest acquisition in India, over 10 times bigger than any other, said the managing director of the fifth largest steelmaker in the world. The deal has made the country, the state and Jamshedpur proud. 

 Muthuraman also expressed hope that the record Tata Steel created by acquiring Corus would be broken. 

 Earlier this morning, an exuberant Muthuraman visited the premises of the Tata Workers Union (TWU). 

 He was accorded a rousing welcome by the office-bearers and other committee members. 

 TWU president Raghunath Pandey and other office-bearers congratulated Muthuraman. 

 He stayed there for 45 minutes and told union officials about the takeover of the Anglo-Dutch company. 

 Pandey said the union would continue to support the managements endeavours in its future acquisition attempts. 

 He said the acquisition was, in no way, going to harm the prospects of the employees at Tata Steels Jamshedpur plant.

 Ragging puts youth in hospital

 Sept. 17 (PTI): A Lucknow student was admitted to the psychiatry ward of a hospital after being ragged on a day another got beaten for refusing to give money to seniors to buy liquor. 

 While Sanjay Singh, a management student, was admitted to a hospital in Lucknow, law student Vivek Rai went to police in Sagar, Madhya Pradesh, on Saturday. 

 Sanjay, of the Sahara Arts and Management Academy, was allegedly ragged by students from Lucknow University and some other institutions who lived in the same hostel, police said. He was allegedly beaten and humiliated when he was on his way to college on a bus. Later, he ran away from the hostel.

 He lost his mental balance, police sources said, but hostel authorities claimed that Sanjay was suffering from some mental disorder. His local guardian lodged an FIR naming three hostel inmates. 

 Vivek, an LLB (Hons) first year student, complained to the police that hostel seniors had beaten him. He named four students, saying that they entered his room late in the night and demanded money to buy liquor. 

 When Vivek refused, they took him to another room. When he again declined to give them money, the students thrashed him.

 Vivek also alleged some seniors kept arms in the hostel to terrorise juniors.

 The university has said action would be taken against the accused students if the ragging charge was proved in the police inquiry.

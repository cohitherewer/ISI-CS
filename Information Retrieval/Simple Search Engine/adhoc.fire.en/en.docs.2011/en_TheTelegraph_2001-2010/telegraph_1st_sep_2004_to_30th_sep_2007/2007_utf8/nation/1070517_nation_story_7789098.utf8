 Something fishy in hospital fridge

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, May 16: An all-season favourite fish in a fridge meant for childrens medicines has led to a government doctors suspension after the stink spread beyond the hospital.

 Mathen P. George, a paediatric surgeon with the Government Medical College in Kottayam, 200 km from state capital Thiruvananthapuram, had allegedly put 5 kg of karimeen pearl spot fish, which fetches nearly Rs 150 a kg in the market in the fridge near the childrens ward.

 A pharmacist who found the fish during a routine stock verification reported the matter to the higher-ups, who were slow to act as it was not a life-and-death issue.

 But activists of the pro-CPI All-India Youth Federation, who got wind of the incident, marched to the hospital and demanded action against the doctor. Hospital authorities then examined the refrigerator and confirmed that full-grown karimeen were inside, stored in plastic bags.

 The youth federation activists alleged that the fish, an all-season favourite in Kerala, was brought by a parent from Kumarakom and given as bribe to the doctor to speed up his childs operation.

 In normal times, fish in a hospital fridge wouldnt have been a serious issue. But tempers were already frayed after reports of deaths of newborns at the Medical College Hospital in Thiruvananthapuram.

 According to Dr S. Latha, the superintendent of the Kottayam hospital, several such complaints had been received against the doctor.

 The vice-principal of the medical college, Dr P. Sukumaran, said such unethical practices were never expected of a doctor.

 Mathen was not available for comment.

 Health minister P.K. Sreemathy has ordered a departmental probe and sought a detailed report from the district medical officer.

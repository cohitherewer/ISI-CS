 Air force sits up after Lanka raid

 SUJAN DUTTA

 The IAF believes the LTTE used this aircraft Czech-made Zlin 143L to bomb the Lankan military base

 New Delhi, March 27: The air raid by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam on a Sri Lankan Air Force base near Colombo yesterday will force the Indian Air Force to almost completely rejig its security grid for southern India, a source said today.

 Analysts at air headquarters in New Delhi and in the Southern Command of the IAF in Thiruvananthapuram began intensive studies almost immediately after the raid by the Air Tigers. 

 The preliminary conclusion is that the LTTE has added a new dimension that was not war-gamed by India in its assessment of military requirements in the peninsula. So far in south India, our main concern has been to secure and protect the sea lanes of communication. Now, there is a new dimension, a source said.

 To begin with, the IAF will very shortly propose procurement of tethered radar systems that come in aerostat balloons. India has already procured aerostat balloons that are used on the western and northern borders. The aerostat balloons are designed to fill the gap in airspace that conventional radars cannot cover. The US has aerostat balloons over large stretches of its southern borders.

 The source said that in peninsular India, civil and military radars were networked, meaning that sensors in the civilian equipment also transmitted pictures to the IAF. Six months ago, Air Defence Identification Zones were also created, requiring every metal flying object to be identified. But obviously this is not enough for the threat that the LTTE represents with its air power.

 A highly-placed officer said the LTTE air attack was audacious. The aircraft probably a Czech-made Zlin 143L flew so low tree-top level that the signatures could not be registered on the Sri Lankan Air Forces radar. 

 The aircraft also flew a distance estimated to be 400 km from an airstrip at Iranamudi in the Wanni jungles in Sri Lankas north. That is a radius that brings large parts of Tamil Nadu including Chennai within the LTTEs strike range, the officer said. 

 Even if the LTTE says its war is not directed against India, we in the military have to look at capabilities. The LTTE has now demonstrated the capability to strike from the air.

 The IAF is scheduled to take delivery of the first of its AWACs an Israeli system mounted on a Russian-origin IL-76 aircraft later this year. Its Southern Command would now be looking at one of the basic AWACs aircraft for its area of responsibility. The command also does not have combat aircraft squadrons in its airbases. 

 The Southern Commands major responsibility has been training. With LTTE now acquiring air power, the IAF will consider stationing elements from its fighter squadrons at the forward bases in Madurai and Salur.

 An air headquarters source said it had been known since 1998 that the LTTE was trying to acquire air power. But it was difficult to understand how its personnel would have been trained. Pilots of the Zlin aircraft would have to practise for the kind of operation they carried out yesterday.

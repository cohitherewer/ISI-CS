 BJP sends in big guns

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 3: The BJP is ready for the final push in Uttar Pradesh. 

 The partys top brass will descend on Gorakhpur in the next couple of days to contribute their bit in polarising public opinion during the seventh and final phase of the staggered Assembly elections.

 L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Rajnath Singh, M. Venkaiah Naidu, Sushma Swaraj and Kalyan Singh are among the leaders who will gather in Gorakhpur, the centre of all activity as the communally sensitive region goes to polls on Tuesday.

 Fifty-nine constituencies, including Mau and Deoria, are up for grabs.

 The focus will be on boosting the efforts of Yogi Adityanath, the BJPs radical MP from Gorakhpur, in consolidating Hindu votes.

 The region has witnessed low-intensity communal flare-ups for the last couple of years. In October 2005, nine persons were killed in a riot in Mau. 

 After that, the BJP MLA from the neighbouring Mohammadabad Assembly constituency in Ghazipur district and seven of his supporters were shot dead in daylight. Independent MLA from Mau and local don Mukhtar Ansari was named prime accused in the killings.

 While Ansari is lodged in Ghazipur jail, the BJP has made the most of the situation with party president Rajnath sitting on an indefinite fast in protest against the incident. 

 The focus is Gorakhpur. Most of our senior leaders are going to be stationed there for the next couple of days. We hope to do well, Naidu said. 

 Joshi will reach Gorakhpur tomorrow evening. This is the last phase. Let us hope all goes well, he said.

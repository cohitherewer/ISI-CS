 Busy at work, outside the set

 Mumbai, Jan. 4: They are paid handsomely to be under the arc-lights, but many stars were raking in the moolah today for appearances that had little to do with acting.

 Life outside the studios and exotic song locales is big business, a boon that comes with the added benefit of publicity for actors who rarely flinch from a ribbon-cutting extravaganza, posing as eye-candy in calendars and shaking a leg at wedding carnivals of the rich and famous.

 But today was remarkable because an entire galaxy of stars dazzled not at their job, but under the glare of public functions.

 Madhuri Dixit emerged from near-obscurity like a shooting star to release 125 biographies of Marathi cinema actors. The evergreen Dev Anand handed in a wrinkle-free manuscript of his autobiography to his publishers. 

 Bipasha Basu, who tickled movie-goers with a bikini romp in Dhoom 2, was clicking away at zapak.com, a gaming website that features a game on her, Beach Blaze. She is believed to charge Rs 60-70 lakh per film. Everything else isnt done free.

 Sameera Reddy, known for her sizzling item numbers, is the desi Lara Croft in a mobile game Paradox Studios launched recently. Shes not in it for the novelty alone.

 In Hyderabad, never short of celebrity power after Sania Mirzas rise, Salman Khan was grabbing eyeballs at the opening of an optical store . In his innings there, he played to the gallery with Mohammed Azharuddin.

 Visibility matters before films release. Sometimes stars oblige a friend, at other times they do it for money. But everything they do is written about. Thats great for a star, says Bollywood trade analyst Komal Nahata. 

For Aishwarya Rai, it hardly matters whether shes doing a big-budget film or endorsing a product. They fetch her as much. The top guns, too, earn more from endorsements, stage shows and ribbon-cuttings than they probably do from films. Amitabh Bachchan has 27 brands under his belt, followed by Shah Rukh Khan with 24. King Khan appears in over 100 ads and the Big B in 75.

 Brand endorsements make a big chunk of an actors income. Sometimes, their earnings from endorsements is more than their income from films. It seems as far as ads are concerned, models are out and stars in. But as far as ribbon-cutting goes, most stars do it for free, but they get publicity out of it, says Nahata. 

 At a New Year bash in a swank hotel, Mallika Sherawats 45-minute jig cost the organisers Rs 50 lakh. The lady who reportedly demanded Rs 1 crore to star in Mahesh Bhatts Gangster, has only Murder as her biggest hit so far.

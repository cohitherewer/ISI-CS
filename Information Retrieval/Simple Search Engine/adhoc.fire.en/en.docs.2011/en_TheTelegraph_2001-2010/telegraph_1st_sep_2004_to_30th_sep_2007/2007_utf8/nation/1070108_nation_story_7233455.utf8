 SC clears air on tribal converts

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: A person belonging to a Scheduled Tribe (ST) does not lose his tribal status on conversion, the Supreme Court has said, says our legal correspondent.

 A bench headed by Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said conversion did change the status of a Scheduled Caste person but not the status of tribals who could follow any religion. 

 The court pointed to an earlier ruling holding that a person belonging to the ST community retained his status after conversion if he continued to follow the tribal ways of life.

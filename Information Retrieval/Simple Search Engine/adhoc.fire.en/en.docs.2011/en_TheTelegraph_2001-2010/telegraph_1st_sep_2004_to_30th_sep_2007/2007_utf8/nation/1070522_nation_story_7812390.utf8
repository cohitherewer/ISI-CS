 Patna, May 21: She is a spinster. He was a widower. And the two had decided to spend Sunday discussing their future. 

 But intruders put paid to their plans they flung Suresh Mahto, the prospective groom, out of the 10th floor flat.

 Mahto had reached Patna in response to a matrimonial advertisement and planned to return to Lucknow the same evening. He claimed he was a deputy general manager with Tata Indicom, but the company has denied it.

 The intruders who barged into the flat of Sadhna Shrivastav, posted as a judge with the Central Administrative Tribunal, had pretended to be CBI officers. Brandishing toy pistols, they first wanted the copy of an order she had signed. Then they wanted her to return Rs 15 lakh, which she had supposedly received from suspended director-general (home guards) Narayan Mishra.

 Finally, they wanted the couple to pose nude.

 All this happened around 3 in the afternoon and the only eyewitness was Shrivastavs 12-year-old domestic help, Jaggan, who had opened the door.

 Shrivastav, in her forties, told police that when she and Mahto refused to oblige the intruders, they grew violent and a scuffle broke out. It was during the scuffle, she claims, that Mahto was flung out of the flat.

 One of the intruders who is still absconding has been identified as Anil Singh, whose father is a police constable deemed close to IPS officer Narayan Mishra. Sources claimed that Anil has been involved in flesh trade, extortion and blackmailing rackets and had recently come out of jail.

 On Monday, the police quizzed the suspended DG for over four hours. Mishra, who is facing a disproportionate assets case, had challenged his suspension before the tribunal but his appeal had been turned down.

 Shrivastav has told the police that she and Mahto were from Allahabad and knew each other. 

 His wife, she added, had passed away a few months ago and he had decided to come down after seeing the matrimonial ad seek-ing a suitable match for her.

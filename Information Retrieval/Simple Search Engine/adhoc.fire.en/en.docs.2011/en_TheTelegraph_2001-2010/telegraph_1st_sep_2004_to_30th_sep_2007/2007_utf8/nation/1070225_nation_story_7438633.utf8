 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Goons wanted, as grooms

Grooms wanted: Tall, dark, handsome and with a good (criminal) background!

 When the Sheikhs of Mumbais Bhiwandi locality look for alliances for girls in the family, they want someone who can lend them a helping hand in stealing. 

 Nasir Wasim Sheikh, a 28-year-old who was arrested last week in connection with a jewellery heist, told the Kalyan unit of the Government Railway Police that this is how his family wants to keep its business running.

 Nasirs sister, for instance, is married to a man named Sarfarsh Menon, who was arrested last year in connection with the theft of diamonds worth Rs 10 lakh, said a senior official investigating the case. 

 The family does not have too many opportunities to vacation together or go for picnics. But the men bond in the evening, showering their loot on beer bars.

 Wimax spreads like wildfire

Wi-Fi is pass. Welcome to a Wimax world.

 A wireless technology for transmitting voice, graphic, picture or data on the Net, the Wimax wave has Hyderabad in its grip.

 Half of Hyderabad is presently covered by the high-speed Wimax network, which is especially benefiting BPOs and SMEs (small and medium enterprises), says Jagdish Kini, group CEO of Aircel Business Solutions (ABS), the countrys premier Wimax provider. 

 An advanced form of Wi-Fi, Wimax has already kicked off in 10 cities including Chennai, Mumbai and Bangalore and is poised to spread its wings across the country.

 We have had 1,000 SME customers, including 50 to 100 in Hyderabad, since the last seven months, says Kini.

 The citys civic officials are happy, too. They say ABS will clear the maze resulting from wires of the lakhs of computers and television sets in Hyderabad. 

 A Wimax connection with a capacity of 5 MBPS costs Rs 3-4 lakh.

 Legislators log in

At Bangalores Vidhan Soudha, the mood is upbeat. The government has gifted laptops to all legislators 224 MLAs and 75 members of the Upper House leaving the exchequer poorer by Rs 1.8 crore.

 The lobbies of the two Houses are now abuzz with the members trying to figure out how to operate their new machines. Many of them have even attended classes.

 The laptops are good news for the common man, too. Any voter can send me a mail on their problem. They need not wait in a queue to meet me and hand over a petition, says an MLA. 

 But the drive to make legislators computer savvy has not been without hiccups. In 2003, then chief minister S.M. Krishna had offered members of the two Houses a handsome allowance to buy computers.

 All of them gratefully accepted the amount, but not many submitted their purchase bills. 

 Once bitten, twice wise, this time the government decided to do the shopping. So, the legislators got the laptops, costing Rs 58,000 each, instead of cash.

 Lord of box office

He might be a demigod to millions in Tamil Nadu, but Rajnikanth cant do without the Lords blessings. 

 The Tamil superstar, whose Shivaji is nearing completion, was spotted coming out of the Tirupati hill shrine last week. 

 I sought Lord Balajis blessings before ending the shooting of my latest film Shivaji. As it has gone off very well, I came to thank the Lord, and also prayed for the success of the film after its release, the actor said.

 Directed by Shankar, the film has been shot in Spain and the US.

 Gratuity benefit for private teachers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 26: Private schools and colleges across the country will soon have to pay teachers gratuity benefits identical to those received by their public-sector peers. 

 Such a rule already exists in Bengal but not in all states. Establishments employing 10 or more persons are expected to pay gratuity.

 The Centre has decided to amend the Payment of Gratuity Act of 1972 to cover teachers in private institutions. The act now ensures that teachers in central government schools receive gratuity. Private schools and colleges were, however, exempt in some states. 

 This is a huge victory, said Sharmishtha Thakur, a teacher in Delhi that is now out of the laws ambit.

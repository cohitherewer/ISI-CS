 Rhodes stand ground as Oxford bristles

 AMIT ROY 

 London, March 7: Two Rhodes scholars who wrote an article slating teaching practices at Oxford claim that some positive comments they had made about the university were left out. 

 Melissa Dell and Swati Mylavarapu, two 23-year-olds who had come to Oxford from the US as Rhodes scholars, were co-authors of Oxford Blues, which appeared in The Harvard Crimson, the daily newspaper at their old alma mater. 

 But in an interview with Cherwell, the student newspaper at Oxford, Dell, studying economic and social history at Trinity College, and Mylavarapu, reading the same subject at Wolfson, appeared taken aback by the storm their criticism had aroused. 

 It was more polemical than we intended it to be and if we had known about the size of audience that it would receive, we would have written it more carefully, Mylavarapu told Cherwell. In the original version, there was a section outlining the positive experiences we have had in Oxford, but it was removed by the Crimson editors before being published. 

 It could be that the article has been taken rather more seriously than it ought to have been. But it is the nature of Oxbridge students to say rude things about the two ancient universities and then, years later, fight to send their children to, where else, Oxbridge. 

 Perhaps the university doth protest too much as well. Lots of undergraduates have, over the years, complained about poor lecturers because some really are poor. 

 In a statement issued to The Telegraph, Dell and Mylavarapu said: We apologise to anyone the article may have offended, and we do not blame the Crimson. The tone we adopted may have been harsh, but we stand by our larger point. 

 The authors said: The intent was not to sound ungrateful for our time at Oxford but to raise issues that students encouraged to apply for the Rhodes do not always examine. The article was intended for Harvard third-years considering their future plans. Our intent was to share some frustrations that are not commonly presented to those students. 

 And they added: The article has initiated debates about Oxford and the Rhodes Scholarship significantly beyond what we originally anticipated. We do not by any means presume to speak for all Rhodes Scholars, but merely wished to make public what some students at Oxford privately complain about. We think that these views, no matter how unpopular or controversial, should be voiced. 

 However, earnest Rhodes scholars, past and present, from the US distanced themselves from the sentiments expressed by the authors. 

 In journalistic terms, The Harvard Crimson must be delighted with the waves it has caused. Over 150 people have written to the journal expressing their point of view. 

 A spokesperson for Oxford University told The Telegraph today: We do not recognise the picture they paint of Oxford, and it seems that the vast majority of our international students would also fail to do so. 

 Oxford recently came top in an independent audit which tracked the experience of international students at the Russell Group (research intensive) universities. The International Graduate Insight Group, which carried out the audit, found that 88 per cent of the universitys international students would recommend Oxford on the basis of their experience and over 80 per cent of students from the US would do so. 

 She went on: Students at Oxford are expected to be independent and to gather and consider evidence themselves so they are not spoon-fed. However, the universitys lecturers and professors take tutorials and supervise students on a scale that would amaze most American counterparts. 

 Students at Oxford do find themselves debating with scholars of the highest international distinction, including Fellows of the Royal Society and Fellows of the British Academy. 

 She defended the Bodelian which had been described as less than inspiring in the article. The Bodleian Library is world-famous and, together with its dependent libraries, holds over eight million volumes on shelving measuring more than 180 kilometres. Dr Sarah Thomas, an American university librarian who oversaw the Cornell University library services, is now in post as Bodleys Librarian, the spokeswoman pointed out. 

 She added: Oxford University welcomes international students, including Rhodes Scholars, with great pleasure and believes they enrich its community. The University looks forward to continuing to work with them in the future. 

 In a letter to The Harvard Crimson, entitled Oxford Is About Transitions And Not For Everyone, Elliot F Gerson, the American Secretary of the Rhodes Trust, symbolically spanked the erring women. 

 I take exception to the op-ed Oxford Blues by Melissa Dell and Swati Mylavarapu, he fumed. It reflects certain misunderstandings harboured by a small percentage of American postgraduates at Oxford (or Cambridge, or frankly at any other European university). It is regrettable if it misleads or discourages the vast majority of Americans whose experiences in Oxford are superb, and who have expectations equally high but more realistic. 

 He acknowledged that despite the best efforts of our selectors, some Rhodes scholars venture to Oxford for the wrong reasons. (One of the disadvantages attached to the fame of the Rhodes scholarships, as Dell and Mylavarapu note, is that some seek the honour and not the degree. 

 Of course, it hasnt helped that the dollar is weak against sterling, but, according to Gerson, the student stipend is, by the way, still extremely generous by any international comparison, and more than adequate to cover all annual expenses except for those who travel the world extensively during vacations. 

 And he metaphorically poked his biro into the girls eyes: Their article suggests that Oxford was not the optimal place for either, which is regrettable, and clearly it is not right for everyone, as we never tire of advisingbut that is unlikely to have been Oxfords (or Harvards) fault.

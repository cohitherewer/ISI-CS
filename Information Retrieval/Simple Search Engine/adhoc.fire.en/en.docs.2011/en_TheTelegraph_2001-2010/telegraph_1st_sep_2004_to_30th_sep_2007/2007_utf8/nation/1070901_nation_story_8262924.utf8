 Advani cut to size, Atal prevails

 Advani: Jinnah re-run?

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: L.K. Advanis flip-flop on the nuclear deal shows he is still unable to set the agenda for the party after the Jinnah controversy eroded his authority, BJP sources said.

 The Sangh parivar realises that Advani alone has the stature to lead the BJP in the next election if health problems rule out Atal Bihari Vajpayee. But, the sources said, there seem to be far too many hurdles in the leader of the Oppositions way and also a question mark over Vajpayees willingness to back him explicitly.

 Advani had to issue a public clarification yesterday on his previous statements on the nuclear deal after calling on Vajpayee on Wednesday night to explain his position.

 Earlier on Monday, Advani had appeared to tone down his partys opposition to the nuclear agreement. A newspaper quoted him as saying the BJP would accept the deal if the Atomic Energy Act was amended, and that unlike the Left, his party had no objection to a strategic partnership with the US that was in national interest.

 The Thursday clarification denied a U-turn from the strident anti-deal line earlier articulated by Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie.

 It added that all the statements on the deal by whichever leader had been fully deliberated upon and approved by the senior-most leaders of the party under the guidance and in the presence of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

 The tone of this line has set tongues wagging in the BJP. Some leaders said foreign policy had always been seen as Vajpayees exclusive domain with Advani seldom foraying into it.

 Other sources said Vajpayee had endorsed what Sinha and Shourie had to say about the nuclear deal, but Advani had tried to change the line without a discussion with the former Prime Minister. They projected this as defiance of Vajpayee, citing how the earlier statement had been formulated at a meeting at his residence.

 Advanis opponents, happy at the developments, argue that nobody is authorised to hijack the partys agenda.

 He did it at the national executive when he asked the party to discuss the Uttar Pradesh debacle although party president Rajnath Singh didnt want it. It undermined Rajnaths authority, a leader said.

 Advanis supporters think the party had missed an opportunity to correct a stance that might drive the middle class away. They argue that Advani had merely fine-tuned the party strategy in the face of criticism that the BJP had reversed its nuclear policy for political gains.

 Many BJP leaders had lauded Advanis stand in private conversations and said the Sinha-Shourie duo had hit an unnecessarily aggressive note. Some of them had cited Vajpayees silence as proof of his disapproval.

 Credit card damages

 New Delhi, May 2 (PTI): The state consumer commission has asked Citibank to pay Rs 55,000 in damages to a man who was forced to cut short his foreign trip after his credit card was seized by a merchant at Hannover in Germany.

 The commission held the bank guilty of causing mental agony and loss of reputation to Dinesh Parwanda who had to abandon his trip to Moscow and return home.

 While leaving for his trip to Germany and Russia in 1988, Parwanda had not taken much foreign exchange as he had a gold visa card against which no amount was due. But when he gave his card to a merchant in Hannover, it was seized on grounds that it was invalid.

 Taking note of the banks failure to update transactions on the credit card, the commission asked it to pay damages.

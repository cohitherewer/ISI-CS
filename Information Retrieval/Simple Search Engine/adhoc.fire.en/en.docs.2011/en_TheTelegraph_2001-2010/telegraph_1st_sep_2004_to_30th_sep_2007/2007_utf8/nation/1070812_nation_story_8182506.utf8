 Ayodhya suspect gunned down

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Jammu, Aug. 11: The suspected mastermind of the suicide attack on the makeshift Ram temple in Ayodhya two years ago fell to police bullets early today after an encounter that lasted nearly an hour.

 Police sources said Jaish-e-Mohammed divisional commander Saifullah Qari was trapped and killed in Ramzan Mohalla, a congested locality on the outskirts of the Kashmir summer capital.

 One of his associates, Zaffar alias Umar, was injured in the gunfight that started around 2.30 at night.

 Jammu inspector-general of police Sheesh Paul Vaid said the neat operation by Delhi and Kashmir police was completed with precision in which only militants were killed. A sub-inspector of Delhi police, Devinder Singh, was injured in the encounter. 

 Vaid said Zaffar has told interrogators that Qari was planning big strikes ahead of or on Independence Day. 

 Qari who arranged men and weapons for the suicide strike on July 2005 when a group of militants came within 70m of blowing up the makeshift shrine had been evading arrest for more than two years.

 Hand cut off, but crusade on course

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Mhow (Madhya Pradesh), April 19: Her hand was chopped off, but that hasnt bruised her spirit.

 Shakuntala Verma, a supervisor in the child and women welfare department, is back campaigning against child marriage on the eve of Akshaya Tritiya, when mass weddings are held across the state.

 This morning, she visited Gukulakhand village in Mhow in Indore district. Little has changed since the attack on me, except that now the state government is more alive to the problem, Verma told The Telegraph.

 When our volunteers visit remote villages, a policeman accompanies us. It lends an impression of security, and villagers have started taking the governments anti-child marriage drive a little more seriously.

 The Anganwadi supervisor, however, rued that in the tribal-dominated regions of Malwa, people still prefer to get sons and daughters married between 10 and 15 years. They want to avoid paying dowry and also protect the chastity of girls before marriage, she said. 

 Akshaya Tritiya is considered an auspicious day when weddings can take place without priests. Under the law, child marriages are illegal but not invalid. If solemnised without obstruction, they gain social legitimacy. 

 Two years ago, on May 10, Verma had to pay the price for coming to these childrens aid. A man had come to her home in Bhanpur village and cut off her left hand. He is still at large. 

 Police tell me investigations are on, Verma said. 

 Doctors at a private hospital in Indore had reattached the hand after a nine-hour surgery. But I cant use it. I have learnt to work only with my right hand, she said. Verma was bed-ridden for over a year.

 Did the experience scare her? Life goes on. Initially, I was terrified by the prospect of touring villages and campaigning against child marriage. But then I realised it was my duty. And what happened two years ago was an accident, Verma said.

 Verma said that on an average, she tours two to three villages a day, going door to door asking villagers not to marry off their children below the age of consent.

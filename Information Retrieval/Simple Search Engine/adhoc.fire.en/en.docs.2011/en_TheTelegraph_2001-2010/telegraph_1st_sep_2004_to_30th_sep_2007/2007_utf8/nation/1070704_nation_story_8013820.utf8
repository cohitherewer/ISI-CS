 Aamir title

 Jodhpur, July 3 (PTI): A court today asked the director and producer of an upcoming Aamir Khan-starrer not to use the title Kajri for the movie and ordered the Indian Motion Pictures Association not to register the name. 

 City-based film distributor Pratap Bulchand has said he holds the distribution rights of another film, which has been registered with the same title.

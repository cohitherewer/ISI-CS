 Sumbal (Baramulla), Jan. 30: As the Jammu and Kashmir government expands its investigations into two more mysterious killings allegedly by police, a round-the-clock security dragnet has been thrown around the presumed grave of Abdul Rahman Padder to prevent any sabotage.

 Padder, a carpenter, is believed to have been killed by the police in a fake shootout last month but was passed off as a Pakistani militant, Abu Hafiz.

 Two policemen Farooq Ahmad Gudoo, an assistant sub-inspector, and Farooq Padder, a constable have been arrested in this connection. SSP, Ganderbal, H.R. Parihar and his deputy, Bahadur Ram, have been attached with the office of the Kashmir IG.

 Four more policemen who were allegedly part of the team that killed the carpenter were today detained for questioning. Official sources told PTI the four were head constables Mohammad Ashraf, Krishan Chand and Surinder, and constable Shamim.

 But Farooq Ahmad, inspector-general (Srinagar-Budgam range), who is heading the probe, refused to identify them. He said the investigation team was detaining several people and nothing could be said till the facts of the case were established.

 The official sources said a police team was deployed at the grave following fears that the accused might exhume the body to subvert the investigations.

 We established a static guard at the grave so that nobody can tamper with evidence. But we do not want to go public with the exact location of the grave, Ahmad said.

 Some more men, including officers, are likely to be behind these killings and we have deployed our men to ensure the investigations are not sabotaged, another official said.

 Kashmir police chief S.M. Sahai said the policemen were deployed to protect the evidence. There appears to be some nexus here and we are trying to ascertain what was the motivation, he said.

 The Jammu and Kashmir government has already given orders for the exhumation of the body by forensic experts. A team of experts from Chandigarh is coming soon to take DNA samples, Sahai said.

 The police, who are guarding the grave, had a tough time quelling protests. Hundreds of people raised slogans and demanded stern punishment for the culprits. 

 We were suspicious from day one about this grave and felt some innocent has been killed. Our worst fears have come true, said Ali Mohammad Bhat, a resident.

 Padders wife Muneera had yesterday expressed apprehension that the delay in exhuming the body would facilitate tampering. We feel there might be something fishy going on to save the culprits. They might change the body in the grave, she said.

 Mohammad Maqbool, another resident who supervised Padders burial, said the police had misled everyone about the incident. 

 We were told that he is a Pakistani militant and was killed in Ganderbal, he said.

 The police have also started investigating two similar cases. Two more civilians, Nazir Ahmad Deki and Ghulam Nabi Wani, were killed last year and passed off as militants. IG Sahai confirmed two more missing cases were being investigated.

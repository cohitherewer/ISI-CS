 Silk, smoother and sweat-free

 Breaking into a sweat? Put on a silk shirt.

 Textile scientist Deepti Gupta of the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, has developed a novel processing technique that will make silk act as a sweat repellent and be smoother on the skin.

 While silk has long been valued as a luxurious fibre, it is not very absorbent. An ideal skin-friendly fibre should be hydrophilic highly absorbent as it draws sweat and water vapour away from the body and helps keep the skin cool and dry.

 Gupta and her colleagues developed a two-step process to impart silk just the right properties.

 The scientists first treated silk with a chemical to turn the fibre hydrophobic water-repellent. Next, they exposed the inner surface to a special ultraviolet lamp that eliminated the chemical selectively from one side and turned it hydrophilic. The energy from the lamp alters the surface of the fibre to make it more absorbent, says Gupta.

 Horror show in the dark

 A late-night movie on Sunday turned into a real-life horror show for many in a Mumbai multiplex.

 A power cut in Suncity, in suburban Vile Parle, had the moviegoers scrambling for the emergency door. But there was none, and the 300 people in the building were stuck in the dark.

 The manager of the multiplex, Arvind Narottamdas, and security supervisor Sunil Sharma were arrested hours later for negligence. 

 The theatre owners are required to make necessary arrangements for the quick exit of moviegoers in case of any emergency, which this hall did not have. There could have been a stampede if not for our timely action, said a senior official of the Vile Parle police station.

 The two were booked under Section 336 of the Indian Penal Code (act endangering life or personal safety of others) and produced before a local court, which granted them bail on a surety of Rs 5,000. 

 Lady B in green fight

 She may be bashing up the baddies on screen like Amitabh Bachchan. But when it comes to the greens, Vijayshanti goes all soft. 

 The actress-politician had earlier cried herself hoarse for a separate Telengana state, but no one listened. Neither did her outfit, Talli Telengana, find any takers. However, once bitten, twice forgotten seems to be the Lady Bs mantra. 

 Vijayshanti has now taken to campaigning against the pollution of the river Musi, which separates the old city of Hyderabad from the new. 

 The 120-km river that flows from Medak district across Hyderabad to merge with the Krishna has turned into a flood drain for over a quarter-century. 

 The actresss tour of the Musis banks drew a huge crowd and she took this opportunity to admonish Hyderabads civic officials. I cannot believe that so close to hi-tech environment, we have people living in such abject poverty and dirt, uncared for by the city fathers, she thundered.

 Namaskar heat

 Chennai may not have seen too many such shows of disenchantment with cricket icons, but tearing up of posters and burning their effigies are not all that rare in India. 

 When Rahul Dravids pictures were burnt the other day, it wasnt over his choice of the playing XI or the World Cup team or not showing that spunk while leading the team. It was for attending an RSS programme in his in-laws town, Nagpur. The CPI youth wing in the southern metro felt it wasnt proper for secular Indias cricket skipper to participate in a suryanamaskar camp.

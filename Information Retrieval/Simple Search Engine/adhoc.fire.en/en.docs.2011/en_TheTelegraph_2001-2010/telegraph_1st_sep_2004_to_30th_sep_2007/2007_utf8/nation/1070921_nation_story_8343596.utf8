 Monkey back

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: A monkey returned to haunt airport officials this evening, two days after wildlife officials thought they had chased away a simian trapped between the false ceiling and the roof, reports our special correspondent. 

 A monkey is running around between the false ceiling and the roof once again in the international departure terminal, an airport official said. 

 For two days since Sunday, a monkey had kept officials on their toes as it managed to find its way into the airport through a hole in the ceiling. 

 Ill-equipped to handle such problems, airport officials had approached wildlife rescue experts for help. Despite lying in wait for hours with dart guns to sedate it, officials were unable to trap the simian.

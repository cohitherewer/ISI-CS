 Maoist mayhem fells 55 cops

 - Over 300 rebels storm Chhattisgarh police camp in dead of night 

 KRISHNA DAS 

 Raipur, March 15: Maoist guerrillas stormed a police camp in Chhattisgarh early today, killing 55 security personnel in one of the deadliest attacks by the rebels in the country.

 More than 300 rebels attacked the camp in Dantewada district around 2.30 in the night, throwing grenades and petrol bombs and setting fire to it before escaping with a cache of arms and explosives.

 We have pulled out 55 bodies from the burnt police camp, said inspector-general of police (Bastar range) R.K. Vij.

 The victims include 16 jawans of the Chhattisgarh Armed Force and 39 special police officers (SPOs) villagers trained, armed and recruited by the government to combat the red army. 

 The surprise attack didnt give the security personnel at the Ranibodli post about 520 km south-west of Chhattisgarhs capital Raipur and surrounded by dense forests the chance even to take position and retaliate.

 The police, however, claimed that the security personnel gave a befitting reply but gave up after running out of ammunition. The raid ended around 5.30 in the morning.

 The police post had been set up a year ago following intensified movement of rebels in the area.

 Seventy-four policemen 24 of the Chhattisgarh Armed Forces ninth battalion and 50 SPOs were at the camp when the rebels attacked.

 According to sources, policemen ran out of their barracks when bombs and grenades exploded, but came under relentless fire.

 Once the cover firing ended, Maoist women cadres stormed the post and overpowered the security personnel. The rebels set the camp on fire before retreating.

 Vij said all 55 died on the spot, and added that 12 personnel, including an assistant platoon commandant, were injured. The remaining seven probably fled, he added.

 The sources added that the Maoists bundled dozens of bodies in a room and attached live bombs to them to foil rescue efforts.

 They even planted pressure bombs and landmines on the way to the post, a source said.

 The rebels took away more than 50 weapons, including AK-47 rifles.

 Chief minister Raman Singh told the Assembly he had briefed the Union home minister about the incident. He has assured assistance from the Centre for rescue and relief work. He added that the Centre has sent a helicopter while the state helicopter had already been pressed into service.

 State home minister Ramvichar Netam, leader of Opposition Mahendra Karma and director general of police .P. Rathor visited the spot in the afternoon. Additional forces have been despatched, officials said.

 Security personnel have launched a massive search operation to hunt down the rebels.

 As the area borders Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, the sources said the possibility of the rebels crossing over to the neighbouring states is not being ruled out.

 At least 676 people have been killed in Maoist-related violence in Chhattisgarh in the past two years. In Andhra, which is also affected by the Maoist menace, the police seized a major arms cache of over 200 rocket launchers, grenades, mines, pistols and explosives.

 Bomb on Calcutta train

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, June 1: A bomb was found on the Sealdah-bound Teesta-Torsa Express at Dhupguri station this afternoon.

 Railway police spotted it in a plastic carry bag in a reserved coach after a tip-off from the army.

 The bomb had been planted in the S1 compartment, said M.S. Punia, the superintendent of railway police. The coach is second from the engine.

 At Dhupguri station, securitymen entered our coach and started searching passengers luggage, said Sudip Biswas, who was travelling with cousin Mousumi Sarkar. They found the plastic bag a few feet ahead of us, under a seat. They ordered us to immediately leave the train.

 Bomb disposal squads of the army and the CID arrived soon after and exploded the bomb in an open field outside the station.

 A source said the army intelligence wing at Binnaguri had received a tip-off this morning that two bombs would be planted in the S1 and S2 compartments of the 3142 Down Teesta-Torsa Express, travelling from Cooch Behar. The train was stopped at Dhupguri around 2 in the afternoon.

 The informer said four persons, probably members of a fundamentalist organisation, would be carrying the bombs, the source added. 

 However, the search on the train yielded only one bomb and no suspects were found.

 Sonia to-do list for CM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 11: Vilasrao Deshmukh has been categorically told by Sonia Gandhi to implement the letter and spirit of the Srikrishna Commission report on the 1992-93 Bombay riots.

 After their meeting today, the chief minister said he had been directed to fill the vacancies in the state boards and corporations and then carry out the cabinet reshuffle.

 The Congress chiefs orders are being seen as a clear indication that Deshmukh would continue as chief minister. Earlier in the day, rumours were abound that he was on his way out.

 Margaret Alva, the general secretary in charge of Maharashtra who had reportedly recommended that Deshmukh be sacked, gave a report to Sonia listing charges against the chief minister. She alleged that Deshmukh was responsible for alienating every section in the state barring a few blind supporters.

 The report also mentioned the killings of Dalits and tribals, with reference to last years Khairlanji episode. It spoke of how the NCP, the Congresss ally, was moving closer to the Shiv Sena.

 Alvas assessment was that while the NCP-Sena cosied up, the BJP looked at Raj Thackeray as a potential ally.

 Smaller parties such as the RSP (Athawale) would prefer to go with the NCP, she reportedly said. Alva warned that thanks to Deshmukh, the party was getting isolated in Maharashtra.

 Electorally, too, she is supposed to have told the leaders that when push came to shove, the Marathas would cast their lot with the NCP and Sharad Pawar, and not Deshmukh.

 Alva urged the high command to send an independent person to examine the political situation and recommend necessary action.

 But sources said the partys problem was finding a replacement for Deshmukh.

 Two names had been floated Sushil Kumar Shinde and Narayan Rane.

 Shinde, the Union power minister, reportedly told his confidants that he was not keen on the job. 

 Rane, a former Sena leader, was not perceived as the best choice in the prevailing circumstances when Sonia is harping on implementing the Srikrishna report.

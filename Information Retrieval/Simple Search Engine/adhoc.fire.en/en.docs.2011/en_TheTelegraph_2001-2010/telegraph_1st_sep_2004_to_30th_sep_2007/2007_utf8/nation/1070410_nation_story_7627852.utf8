 IAF takes a U-turn: to lend pilots to Air-India

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Major shift in manpower policy 

 New Delhi, April 9: The Indian Air Force has agreed to release about 20 pilots to Air-India after the national carrier projected a shortfall in flying crew. The chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major, said today that the pilots would be released periodically.

 Decisions on how many pilots would be released and at what intervals would be taken after an assessment of the needs of Air-India by the IAF. Air-India is currently short by about 118 pilots. But the IAF is also concerned that the burgeoning civil aviation industry is weaning away its own pilots.

 The decision marks a major shift in manpower policy for the IAF. In 2005, the then chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi, put his foot down and refused to release IAF pilots. My fighting force has to be in the cockpit. Our civil aviation (industry) has grown by 25 per cent. The price of air crew is moving up rapidly. Our problem is how to retain our air crew. Pilot poaching is a threat, he had said.

 The government had rejected requests from an estimated 20 air force pilots to leave the service. An IAF officer can seek premature retirement at any time but it was up to the government to take a view on such pleas. The officer is entitled to pension after 20 years of service.

 The IAF is also concerned over a shortfall of pilots and in the last two years has made it difficult for its pilots to leave the service. But Major said an exception was being made for Air-India because it was the national carrier.

 We have signed a memorandum of understanding with Air-India whereby we will be releasing 15 to 20 pilots at intervals to be absorbed in the national carrier, he said. The government is working on a programme to merge Air-India and Indian into a single airline.

 The pilots released by the IAF for Air-India would be mostly from the transport stream fliers of the IAFs Ilyushin 76 and 78 and AN 32s and would be near the end of their mandatory service with the force or would have been LMCd, jargon for Low Medical Category.

 The IAF is likely to stipulate a minimum age limit of around 50 years for pilots who it will consider as candidates for Air-India. The selected officers would most likely be deputed to Air-India for a year after which they may be given the option of retiring, rejoining the service or being absorbed in the civilian airline.

 Salaries in the ranks of group captain to air vice-marshal range from Rs 35,000 to Rs 50,000 plus perks (housing, medical benefits, vehicle, childrens education). In addition, pilots in these ranks draw a flying allowance between Rs 7,000 and Rs 8,000.

 Fighter aircraft pilots would have to undergo a conversion period after which they will be eligible for a commercial pilots licence. Salaries in Air-India at that level would be between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 2.5 lakh. But the civilian airline would have a different set of perks. Air-India pilots would also be on contract and not on a regular payscale unlike IAF pilots.

 The national carrier is scheduled to add 500 aircraft to its fleet in the next five years. This will result in its demanding a larger number of pilots. 

 The IAF is also in the process of replenishing its fleet and will need additional pilots. Later this year it will begin inducting the first of 66 British Hawk Advanced Jet Trainers.

 The IAF cites two reasons for its reluctance to release its pilots to private players in civil aviation. 

 First, the service invests about Rs 10 crore to train a fighter aircraft pilot and about half that amount to train a transport aircraft pilot. Second, the IAF has to ensure that its supply of pilots does not fall short of its combat requirements. Air headquarters has also been concerned that many IAF pilots were acquiring commercial flying licences.

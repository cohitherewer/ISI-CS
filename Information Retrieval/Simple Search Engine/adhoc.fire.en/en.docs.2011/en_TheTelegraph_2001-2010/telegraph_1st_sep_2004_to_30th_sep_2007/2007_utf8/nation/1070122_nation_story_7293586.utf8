 Sai Baba gets atheist CMs salute

 Chennai, Jan. 21: The miracles never impressed him. But when Sathya Sai Baba spent Rs 200 crore to bring water to parched millions in his city, lifelong atheist M. Karunanidhi was prepared to bow before him.

 The Tamil Nadu chief minister today saluted the Baba for helping complete the Telugu Ganga project that brings drinking water from the Krishna to Chennai.

 People may ask how an atheist can share a platform with Sai Baba, mused the DMK chief, a veteran of the atheistic Dravidian movement, at a function attended by three Union ministers, two chief ministers and two governors. What brings me here is the principle that service to man is service to God.

 There was no such hesitation in the minds of Union home minister Shivraj Patil or Karnataka chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy as they dubbed the 81-year-old godman a part of divine reality.

 Railway minister Lalu Prasad a star guest along with Sunil Gavaskar was equally effusive. I didnt believe in Sai Baba at first, but when I met him my mind changed, he said, offering pranams. He isnt just Baba any more, he is God now.

 The water project was started in 1983. Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra each committed 5 tmcft of the Krishnas waters for Chennai, but after its completion in 1996, the 80-km canal showed itself unable to do its job.

 The Sri Sathya Central Trust then stepped in. It lined the canal with a special concrete mix and high-density polyethylene sheets, stopping seepage. The canal has been renamed Sai Ganga Canal.

 T.V.S. Motors chairman V. Srinivasan said at the function that this was an example of how spiritual gurus could help solve day-to-day problems.

 Tax raid on woman, Modi minister in a sweat

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, July 30: An income-tax raid on a little-known but influential woman has led to Narendra Modis number two facing uncomfortable questions.

 Gujarat finance minister Vajubhai Vala and many other political bigwigs are alleged to have invested in real estate and stocks through Sejal Shah, 34, who appears to have enjoyed easy access to ministers chambers.

 Vala has admitted he knows Shah, but has denied being close to her or making investments through her.

 The raids together with tax officials claims of major seizures, including three diaries containing names, have perked up the BJP rebels. They have asked for an inquiry against Vala and a BJP source said the ministers job could be at stake.

 I know her, but then, I know so many people. Im in public life after all, he said. Many people meet me every day. I have no special friendship with Sejal Shah. She is neither a friend nor a business partner.

 The minister said his two sons looked after his investments. My investments are in Rajkot, my hometown. I have none in Ahmedabad.

 Shah said she was neither close to Vala nor had she ever managed the investments of influential people. Its all rubbish, she said. Im innocent. I have not done anything illegal.

 She suggested that an employee she had sacked for theft had complained to the income-tax department and triggered the raids.

 Tax officials said the two-day weekend raids yielded jewellery and unaccounted cash with the diaries that contain details of investments in real estate and the share market. Several politicians are believed to have made discreet inquiries to find out if the diaries had their names.

 Its not just the finance minister. At least half-a-dozen ministers have been investing in real estate through this woman, said BJP rebel Dhiru Gajera.

 Tax officials claimed Shah had routed her investments through some 15 firms. They said she was a partner in or the owner of four.

 The officials added that Shah bought dead firms and revived them. She is said to own a bungalow and five luxury cars, including a Mercedes and an imported SUV.

 A BJP source said Shahs association with Vala had begun in 1998 after he joined the Keshubhai Patel cabinet.

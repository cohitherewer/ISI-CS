 Rebels sup with Cong

 BASANT RAWAT

 Modi

 Rajkot, Sept. 14: BJP dissidents today came out against Narendra Modi at a convention also attended by Congress leaders, fuelling speculation they were about to cross over.

 The farmers rally at Rajkot was unlike other rebel sessions because for the first time, the leaders publicly urged the people to vote for the Congress and defeat the BJP. 

 The leaders slammed Modi, saying the BJP had lost credibility in Gujarat and that the chief minister was not acceptable to them at any cost. 

 A resolution seeking Modis removal was adopted and a pledge taken to run campaigns across the state to topple the corrupt government.

 The farmers at the gathering were mostly from Saurashtra and Kutch, which send 58 MLAs to the 182-member Assembly. These areas have been BJP strongholds for several years.

 With the Patels and the Kolis, two communities that can influence election results, drifting away from the BJP, the dissidents could be mulling switching over to the Congress.

 The presence of some Congress leaders, including Amreli MP Virji Dhumar and MLA Vithal Radhadia, at the convention strengthened the perception. Earlier, the buzz was that the rebels would float a new party.

 Suspended Rajkot MLA Sidharth Parmar and his fellow lawmaker from Surat, Dhiru Gajera, told the gathering there was no BJP in Gujarat.

 It is Modis private limited company. There are only two parties, the Congress and Modi, Gajera said. 

 Soma Patel, the Surendranagar MP and a prominent Koli leader, dared the BJP to suspend him. 

 With other Modi-baiters like former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, Kashiram Rana and Suresh Mehta staying away, it was Gordhan Zadaphia who led the charge. Zadaphia is a protg of VHP leader Praveen Togadia.

 The Modi camp, perhaps, had an inkling of the huge turnout in Rajkot. A meeting of his loyalists, where some ministers were supposed to have participated, was cancelled.

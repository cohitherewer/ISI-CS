 SC rejects plea against Pratibha

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 3: The Supreme Court today dismissed a petition seeking to bar Pratibha Patil from contesting the presidential election on the ground that the petitioner did not have evidence to back his allegations. 

 Two other petitions are, however, pending in Delhi High Court.

 The bench rejected the claim of Manohar Lal Sharma, an apex court advocate, that an inquiry was needed into the allegations. 

 A TV channel has claimed it has documents showing that a cooperative bank in Pratibhas name collected money from employees for the Prime Ministers Kargil Fund but never deposited the amount. The petition also alleged that Pratibha had been declared bankrupt by the RBI, when it withdrew her banks licence. 

 He was, however, unable to provide documents to support his claim.

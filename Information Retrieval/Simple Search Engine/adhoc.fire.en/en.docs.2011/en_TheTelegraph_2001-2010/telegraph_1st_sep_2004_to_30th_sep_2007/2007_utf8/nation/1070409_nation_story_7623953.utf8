 Gene answer to dog size puzzle

 New Delhi, April 8: In a landmark study of canine genetics, scientists have demystified the extreme but unexplained diversity in the size of dogs as seen from the smallest Chihuahuas to the largest Great Danes.

 An international research team has pinpointed a sequence of genetic material, or DNA, that can explain why some breeds of dogs are small while others tower as giants among domesticated canines.

 Biologist Nathan Sutter at the National Human Genome Research Institute in the US and his colleagues have shown how DNA variations close to a gene called IGF-1 can account for small breeds such as Chihuahuas, Pomeranians or Toy Fox Terriers.

 Their findings were published last week in the US journal Science. The study also reveals how humans played a role in spawning dog diversity. Our findings support the idea that strong selective breeding by humans is responsible for the great diversity in skeletal size and skeletal shape that we observe in todays dog breeds, Sutter told The Telegraph.

 Dogs evolved from wolves and were domesticated by early humans between 12,000 and 15,000 years ago.

 The worlds 350 breeds of domesticated dogs today exhibit greater diversity in body size than any terrestrial vertebrate.

 The hormone produced by the IGF-1 gene regulates growth in humans and other mammals from birth to adolescence.

 In small dogs, mutations in DNA next to this gene suppress the genes activity and keep small dogs from growing larger, said K. Gordon Lark, a collaborating biologist at the University of Utah. Larger dogs also have IGF-1 gene, but its neighbouring DNA is slightly different.

 The scientists analysed DNA extracted from the cheek swabs of 3,241 dogs from 143 breeds representing size diversity from the small Chihuahua, Pomeranian, and Pekingese to the large Great Dane, Irish Wolfhound and Saint Bernard. Without human selection there would not be such diversity in dog sizes, Lark told The Telegraph. Humans selected the dog size and shape they preferred for specific working tasks or appearances, said Lark.

 The study began several years ago when Lark and his colleagues studied the DNA of the Portuguese Water Dog which displays large variations in size. They found the link between the DNA sequence near IGF-1 and small dogs. Sutter and his colleagues then extended the study to other breeds.

 Scientists believe the genetic instructions for small dogs emerged either because a small wolf could not survive in nature, but survived in the company of humans, or because an early human domesticated a small wolf rather than a large one. Humans helped the genetic code for small dogs to spread around the world. While some people bred dogs to become guard dogs or hunting dogs, others preferred small dogs. Tiny dogs do not hunt or help protect a house, but theyre small and sweet, said Kevin Chase, a University of Utah scientist.

 In addition to revealing insights into the genetics of small dogs, scientists said, the new study also demonstrates the power of the dog as a model for the analysis of complex traits in this case, body size.

 Dogs share our environment and in many cases share the genetic causes for diseases. The dog will be an invaluable resource for the exploration of complex diseases such as cancer, diabetes or arthritis, Chase told The Telegraph.

 The IGF-1 hormone may also have a role in some human diseases. Indeed, the IGF-1 gene that weve identified as important in determining body size in the dog is also implicated in a mans risk to develop prostate cancer, Sutter said.

 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Stone in ground, wait for takeoff

 Seated on a feather-soft couch with their feet up and tasting delicacies from a range of restaurants, visitors to Delhi airport will soon be able to see next-generation super-jumbos racing down one of Asias longest runways.

 Delhis Indira Gandhi International Airport often the butt of ridicule for its lack of facilities despite being the countrys gateway is set to go world class.

 UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi has laid the foundation stone for a new terminal No. 3 that will cater to both domestic and international travellers.

 The airport will serve as a benchmark for other cities, said Srinivas Bommidala, managing director of Delhi International Airport Limited.

 The two-tier building will consist of a departure complex on the upper level and the arrival zone on the lower an array of restaurants and duty-free shops with a view of the runway will form the backdrop. The terminal will have 74 aerobridges and 30 remote stands to park 200 aircraft. The terminal will be complete by the time of the Commonwealth Games in 2010.

 A Sourav fan with a century

 At 100, K.A. Shivram has seen all seasons of life. He gorges on junk food and loves to cheer his heart out for Sourav Ganguly.

 As many as 160 members of Shivrams family gathered on February 17 at his Matunga house to celebrate 100 years of his existence and the man himself is ready to soak in the good cheer around him. 

 I have turned 100 so that I can have all of my family in one place before me like this, Shivram declared as a thunderous applause drowned his voice. 

 His son, six daughters, 14 grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and their extended families have gathered from all over Mulund, Vasai, Malad, Chembur, Chennai, China, Bahrain, Dubai and the US to felicitate the centenarian.

 Shivram, who hails from Kerala and worked in a pharmaceutical company, is in great shape. He easily swings himself into a sitting position in bed. No pills, except Vitamin B Complex, are popped and his only complaint is loss of hearing in one ear.

 Little Sachin a soccer star

 What does the Master Blaster do when hes down with a bad back? He turns to football. 

 But dont panic. Sachin Tendulkar is not hanging up his boots yet. He is just being a doting dad to son Arjun.

 The seven-year-old was captaining his school team in a soccer match at Azad Maidan on February 16.

 Watching from the stands was his proud papa in a Manchester United T-shirt, while mum Anjali screamed her lungs out, cheering her little master.

 The crowd roared every time Arjun touched the ball, but he took the stardom in his stride, scampering around the field.

 During the break, senior Tendulkar gave juniors team a pep talk. So you are down one goal. It does not matter, you have another 45 minutes to go.

 youngster corrected him. Sir, it is not 45 but 20 minutes. A sheepish Sachin replied: I am sorry.

 Dhirubhai Ambani International School, Arjuns side, lost to New Activity 1-2. But Sachin has surely set higher goals for his son.

 Drink debacle

 When youve had a tipple too many, youd better take the day off. Or else, the hangover could be tough to get rid of.

 Sivaramakrishnan found that out recently.

 The Railway Mail Service employee in Tiruchirappalli would often come to office drunk. Once, when he was pulled up, Sivaramakrishnan attacked his boss with a sickle.

 Police registered a criminal case and the postal department showed him the door.

 A tribunal granted Sivaramakrishnan a reprieve, but Madras High Court upheld the sack order and he was left jobless.

 Mumbai: A wedding coming up? If you are visiting Mumbai, drop in at the Parinay exhibition at the Bandra Kurla complex. A range of wedding-related services is on offer from February 24 to 27. From jewellery to honeymoon packages, Parinay will meet the needs of the bride, groom and their relatives.

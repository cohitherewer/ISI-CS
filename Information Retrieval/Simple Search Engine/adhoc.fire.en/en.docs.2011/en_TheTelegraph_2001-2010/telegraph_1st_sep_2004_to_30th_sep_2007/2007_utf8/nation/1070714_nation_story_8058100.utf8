 Terror squad

 New Delhi, July 13: Bangalore will soon have an anti-terrorist squad like Mumbai to deal with increasing sabotage threats, reports our special correspondent. 

 We have decided to constitute a separate and dedicated ATS for Bangalore as the otherwise peaceful IT city now needs to be protected better, K.R. Srinivasan, Karnataka director-general of police, said. 

 The police chief met Union home ministry officials today to brief them about the progress in the probe on the Ahmed brothers, suspects in the foiled bomb plots in Britain.

 New Delhi master plan under court scanner

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: The Supreme Court today directed the Centre to produce the documents it had relied on while formulating the 2021 Master Plan, which is seen by many as an attempt to bury the sealing controversy. 

 The apex court had ordered the sealing of commercial properties in areas described as residential under the 2001 Master Plan.

 When traders took to the streets, the government came to their rescue by issuing notifications allowing mixed-land use in certain areas. But the move was challenged on the ground that it was an attempt to circumvent the orders of the court. So the government decided to come up with a new master plan. 

 The court today adjourned the matter for hearing two weeks later, after it was told that the new plan would be notified within a week. 

 The status of individual premises would be judged according to the new plan, once it comes into force, and the protection provided by the notifications would no longer be needed. 

 Traders had welcomed the 2021 Master Plan as courts do not usually interfere with policy documents. However, courts can scrutinise documents and see whether the government had applied its mind before arriving at a particular decision.

 The Supreme Court also refused to extend the date for filing of affidavits by traders in residential areas who want to stay put till the validity of the notifications is decided. The court explained that under the new master plan, there would be no need to look into the validity of notifications. 

 In the proposed plan, more than 1,000 colonies have been regularised and mixed-land use has been allowed in several areas.

 London, July 30: Cambridge and Oxford have come out top in a guide to 113 UK universities published today, with Imperial College ranked third, the London School of Economics fourth and St Andrews fifth. 

 Although both Cambridge and Oxford want more Indian students, they also remain the hardest to get into, leaving aside all questions of cost. 

 The others in the top 10, in descending order, are University College London, Bristol, Warwick, Bath and Durham. 

 The online Good University Guide provides valuable tips to students, both from Britain and overseas, especially from India, so long as the data is used wisely. 

 For the past 15 years, the UK has been ranking universities by measuring nine key aspects of university activity using the most recent data available at the time of compilation. 

 However, for the first time, students will be able to customise the table by setting their own priorities. 

 The section on foreign students reveals that China is preparing for global intellectual domination by encouraging its young men and women to go to the UK in big numbers. Figures for 2004-2005 show that out of 75,573 foreign students arriving for first degrees from non-European Union countries, 20,321 26.9 per cent came from the Republic of China. That is nearly seven times the number from India. 

 The number from China compares with 7,155 (9.5 per cent) from Hong Kong; 7,123 (9.4 per cent) from Malaysia; 3,006 (4.0 per cent) from India; 2,750 (3.6 per cent) from Nigeria; 2,680 (3.5 per cent) from the US; 2,151 (2.8 per cent) from Singapore; Japan 1,916 (2.5 per cent) from Japan; and 1,913 (2.5 per cent) from Pakistan. 

 For overseas students, the favoured subjects are: business and administrative studies, engineering and technology, social, economic and political studies, computer science, creative arts and design, legal studies, subjects allied to medicine and biological sciences. 

 The greatest gathering of foreign students from non-EU countries were at: Manchester (2,355); Nottingham (2,131); Middlesex (2,101); University of the Arts, London (1,967); Imperial College (1,727); Warwick (1,521); University College London (1,495); London School of Economics (1,439); Hertfordshire (1,344); and Portsmouth (1,308). 

 The guide urges students not to rush to judgement over where they should study because the tables are based solely on the numbers of overseas students attending a particular university and say nothing about the quality of that university. 

 It acknowledges: Perhaps the least surprising conclusions to be drawn from the table are that Oxbridge and the University of London remain the dominant forces in British higher education and that the new universities still have ground to make up on the old. 

 The former polytechnics have different priorities from those of any of their more established counterparts, however, and many can demonstrate strengths in other areas.

 It adds that the table belies the systems reputation for rigidity. For example, Oxford Brookes, a former polytechnic, continues to outperform a number of long-established universities. No doubt others will follow before too long. The remarkable rise of universities such as Warwick and Bath, both founded less than fifty years ago, shows what can be achieved in a relatively short space of time. 

 It explains that data for the league table come from sources in the public domain. The Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) provided data for entry standards, student-staff ratios, spending on academic services, facilities spending, good honours degrees, graduate prospects and overseas student enrolments. In a few cases the source data were not available and were obtained directly from the individual universities. 

 Student satisfaction is also taken into account. The guide says that the National Student Survey, a survey of 157,000 final-year students in January/February 2006, asked questions about a variety of aspects of teaching. 

 The survey is a measure of student opinion, not a direct measure of quality, it accepts. A top-notch university expected to deliver really excellent teaching could score lower than a less good university which, while offering lower quality teaching, nonetheless does better than students expect from it. 

 The guide says: The Prime Ministers initiative to recruit an additional 50,000 university students from overseas by 2005 was achieved a year early. The demand is buoyant with significant numbers coming particularly from China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, India, Nigeria and the USA. 

 It promotes the advantages of studying in Britain: In many UK universities you could expect to have fellow students from over 100 countries across the world. The British university system is truly a global one and increasingly so with more than one in ten of its student population a much higher figure than the USA coming from countries overseas.

 Glare shifts to Samuels SIM

 Mumbai/Nagpur, March 2: As cricket teams began arriving in the Caribbean today, it emerged that West Indies all-rounder Marlon Samuels had made calls on a pre-paid mobile phone before the January 21 one-dayer in Nagpur.

 Samuels used the SIM card to make calls worth Rs 6,000 about five hours of talktime, police sources said.

 We had not tapped the conversations made from this mobile phone and learnt about it later. The phone records do not show anything suspicious, a senior Nagpur police official said.

 The police had claimed to have intercepted phone conversations between Samuels and suspected bookie Mukesh Kochchar by tapping the landline in room 203 at Hotel Pride in Nagpur on January 19 and 20. 

 Samuels had passed on information on the bowling line-up of the West Indies team during four calls made late in the night, the police said. 

 A criminal case was not registered on the ground that there was no direct evidence of match-fixing, but Nagpur police wrote to the ICC that Samuels had broken the Players Code of Conduct. Rule C-3 of the code, laid down after the Hansie Cronje match-fixing scandal, warns players not to be in touch with known bookies. If found guilty of violation, a player can face a ban of two to five years and a fine.

 Samuels had acquired the SIM card of a private telephone operator with help from Vasu Gangwani, a liaison officer for the West Indies team during the tour. Gangwani, who belongs to Indore a prominent betting hub sought the help of the hotel staff to get the card (no. 9970137717) and gave a photo-copy of his driving licence as proof.

 Samuels does not seem to have spoken to Kochchar using this phone. We have given the details of the call list to the ICC team, the Nagpur police official said.

 The new revelation came a day after the police handed over the investigation material, including the tapes containing the tapped conversations and their transcripts, to a two-member ICC team. 

 Senior investigator Alan Peacock and regional security manager N.S. Virk of the anti-corruption and security unit had reached Nagpur yesterday to collect the material, after the home ministry gave its clearance.

 Peacock and Virk had also been part of a four-member ICC team that visited Nagpur last month to probe the scandal, but had to go back without the evidence gathered by the police in the absence of a formal permission. 

 The ICC team has not indicated any time frame for completing the probe, and did not say if it would question Samuels. 

 Samuels is in the West Indies squad of 15.

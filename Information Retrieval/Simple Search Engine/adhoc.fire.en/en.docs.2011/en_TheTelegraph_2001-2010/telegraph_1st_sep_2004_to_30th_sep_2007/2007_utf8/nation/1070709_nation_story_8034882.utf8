 Soumitra burns hole in hosts pocket

 - Visa fee too steep for London rsquo;s Tagore Centre

 London, July 8: Actor Soumitra Chatterjee emerged from the Bloomsbury Theatre in London last night and delivered his most heartfelt lines: Arey, ekta cigarette de na to banchte parchhi naa. 

 That transliterates to: God, I am dying for a cigarette. Or in working-class slang: Giveusafag! 

 Either way, nothing could be more politically incorrect in post-July 1 London where smoking is banned in offices, restaurants, stations and just about any public space. 

 For the Bengali old timers who have run the Tagore Centre since 1985, the visa charges involved in bringing Soumitra and seven fellow actors from Calcutta are almost enough to drive even non-smokers to chain smoking plus several double whiskies. 

 Kalyan Kundu, the executive director of the Tagore Centre and one of those who keeps traditional Bengali culture alive in London in the face of the Bollywood juggernaut, summed it up. We had budgeted to pay the normal tourist visa, about 60, that is about 500 for a group of eight. 

 Then followed a shock increase in the visa charge for entertainers and sportsmen. It went up to about 210 Rs 18,000 a person, he said. Time was short, so we just paid up. For the Tagore Centre, with its modest budget, having to find 1,680 at short notice was crippling. 

 In an interview to The Telegraph, Kundu today appealed to the British authorities in India, especially the office of the deputy high commissioner in Calcutta, to bring down the visa charges to a level that was reasonable. 

 He made the point that for Bollywood promoters bringing the likes of Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan to London Rs 18,000 is loose change. But as Sharmila Tagore pointed out at the Nehru Centre the other day, there are creative and innovative things other than Bollywood happening all over in India. And we would like people in the UK to be aware of them. 

 Unfortunately, the immigration department at the home office sees visas as a way of making money. Their attitude is: If you dont want to pay, dont come. 

 Soumitra and his fellow actors Poulami Bose, Uma Bose, Alokananda Roy, Anandi Ghosh, Sumana Nag and Amrit Khatua are in the UK with a production of the play Homapakhi. 

 Written by Londoner Amit Biswas, the dark play tells of Sraboni, a psychiatrist who returns home to Calcutta to escape what she feels is her lonely and empty life in London. She wants to forget the suicide of one of her patients, a Pakistani girl, and also the collapse of her own marriage. 

 But the Bengali audience had come to see Soumitra, who plays Srabonis old college professor, Niranjan Ganguly. 

 This morning, the actors left for Glasgow, where there will be a performance of Homapakhi, followed by others in Liverpool, Birmingham, the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in London and Brick Lane, the heart of the Bangladeshi settlement in east London. 

 It is 10 years since Soumitra last came to London for a play. I came for Tiktiki, he recalled, referring to the Bengali adaptation of Anthony Schaffers The Sleuth. 

 The 72-year-old actor was introduced to the audience by Amalendu Biswas, chairman of the Tagore Centre as one of the finest actors of his generation. 

 The year 2009 will mark the 50th anniversary of Soumitras debut in Apur Sansar, the third film in Satyajit Rays trilogy. 

 In the intervening half-century, many of the children of the children of the Bengali doctors who first came to Britain have become solid middle-class members of the medical profession. The old clich held true: if anyone had to choose a venue to have a heart attack or seek psychoanalysis, the Bloomsbury Theatre was the place last night.

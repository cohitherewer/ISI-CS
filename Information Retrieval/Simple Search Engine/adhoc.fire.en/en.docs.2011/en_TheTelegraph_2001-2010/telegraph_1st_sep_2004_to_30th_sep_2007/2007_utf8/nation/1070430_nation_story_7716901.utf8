 Menon on US tightrope

 K.P. NAYAR

 Menon, Burns: Chill in the air

 Washington, April 29: Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon and the Bush administration are set to embark on two days of talks, which are expected to be the most delicate between the two countries since Washington began courting Delhi as a potential Asian ally six years ago.

 As the talks get under way, Menon will discover that the temperature in the state department where he was just two months ago has become chilly, notwithstanding the beautiful Washington spring outside, and the agenda on his table a lot tougher than in February.

 The Americans are full of complaints about the Indian government for the first time since former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and later Manmohan Singh met Bush to usher in sweeping changes in Indo-US bilateral relations.

 They are upset that defence minister A.K. Antony and Indias military establishment are dragging their feet on the process for acquiring 126 multi-role combat aircraft in what would be the biggest military aviation deal in history. Boeings defence production wing is in the race for that order.

 Washington is even more upset that American companies were turfed out of a military helicopter deal, for which the Europeans were favoured.

 American officials complain in private that they had been promised the deal earlier by top decision-makers in the Indian government.

 There is concern here that Delhis relations with Moscow are on an upward spiral and translated into a variety of firm orders for military, nuclear and other Russian products during President Vladimir Putins visit to India in January.

 There is also worry in Washington that both France and Israel quiet, but staunch supporters of India on a variety of issues are major beneficiaries of Indian spending power in the area of defence procurement.

 The list of complaints that Menon will be confronted with is long and includes Indias non-cooperation with the US agenda at the UN and even in relatively less significant fora such as the Community of Democracies, which the two countries together founded under the Bill Clinton administration.

 But Nicholas Burns, the US under-secretary of state for political affairs and one of Menons main interlocutors here, is an exceptionally suave diplomat, who is unlikely to let these feelings get the better of his discretion.

 On the eve of the talks with India, the American strategy appears to be to win Menon over with charm.

 In an honour that is usually reserved for visiting Presidents and Prime Ministers, Burns today wrote an article on the oped page of The Washington Post under the headline Heady times for India and the US. He predicted that within a generation Americans may view India as one of our two or three most important strategic partners.

 However, if the Bush administration finds in the next two days that its charm offensive has not worked on Menon and that it is subsequently unable to push Delhi away from its perceived negativism on several issues, Washingtons attitude towards India may harden. 

 Contrary to the popular impression in India, Menon is not in Washington to advance the so-called 123-Agreement under Section 123 of the US Atomic Energy Act, the next step in operationalising the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 In fact, he will only come to grips with the nuclear deal on the second day of his visit, leaving the issue on Monday to S. Jaishankar, Indias high commissioner to Singapore, and R.S. Jassal, the Indian deputy chief of mission, to wrestle with the Americans over the text of the agreement.

 Jaishankar will pick up the threads of the discussions he had in Cape Town a fortnight ago with Richard Stratford, the state departments director for nuclear energy affairs.

 Menons main agenda on Monday will be talks with Paula Dobriansky, the US under-secretary of state for global affairs and democracy. They will meet in the framework of the Indo-US Global Issue Forum, set up in 2002 to strengthen areas of cooperation on issues of global interest and explore new avenues of cooperative endeavour.

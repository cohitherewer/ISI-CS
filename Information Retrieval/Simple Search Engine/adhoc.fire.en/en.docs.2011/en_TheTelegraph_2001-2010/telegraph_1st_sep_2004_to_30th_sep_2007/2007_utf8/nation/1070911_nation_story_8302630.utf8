 Early House bell spares govt amp; Left blushes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Sept. 10: Parliament has been adjourned indefinitely, four days ahead of schedule. 

 The Indo-US nuclear deal, whose shadow hung large over this monsoon session and cast doubts over the governments survival, went undebated as the battle lines between the UPA and the NDA were firmly etched.

 To the last, the NDA stuck to its demand that if the government did not give in to its demand for a joint parliamentary committee to look into the deal, it would not allow the House to run. 

 The governments contention expressed in a ruling given by Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee was that neither parliamentary convention nor the Constitution mandated that a treaty or agreement signed on foreign soil could be referred to a House committee.

 But there were some silver linings in the aborted session for the Congress and the Left. Privately, the Congress sounded relieved on not having a debate. Forget the NDA, it would have shown up the UPA-Left cracks badly, a cabinet minister admitted.

 The government was spared the embarrassment of answering questions on price rise and the wheat import it would have had to face if the House been allowed to function.

 The other issue that went undiscussed, the Sachar report, may have shown the Left poorly because the commission had indicted the Bengal government for doing little for Muslims.

 The only tangible achievement the government and the Congress would remember this session for was the introduction of the Unorganised Sector Workers Social Security Bill, which has been sent to a standing committee.

 The bill is a follow-up on a promise contained in the National Common Minimum Programme and, if enacted, will notify welfare schemes on life and disability cover, health and maternity benefits and old age protection. 

 CPMs Brinda Karat slammed the bills introduction as the worst kind of tokenism but the Congress will flog the initiative as a significant achievement.

 The UPA-Left panel on the nuclear deal will hold its first meeting tomorrow. Pranab Mukherjee, the foreign minister and the panel convener, said: Everything will be decided at the meeting the time-frame, procedures to be adopted. Let us see what happens.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed anguish at the frequent disruptions in the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha. (See chart)

 Asked what he thought of Parliaments conduct, the Prime Minister replied in Urdu: We did everything we could with the utmost sincerity and conviction, but if they (the Opposition) didnt reciprocate in kind, what more can I say?

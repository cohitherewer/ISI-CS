 Shares and jobs in SEZ recipe

 New Delhi, Jan. 15: Factories on non-arable land, jobs for at least one displaced family member and shares in the project being set up these are the key solutions industry has offered for special economic zones (SEZ).

 As suggestions for the governments SEZ policy, the CII wants the government to take over non-arable land with good connectivity. Farmers who part with their land could be provided equity (based on market rates) in the project. 

 However, if cultivable land is given for the short term to facilitate quick industrialisation, the state government must ensure that its fertility isnt lost absolutely, CII president R. Seshasayee told The Telegraph.

 Seshasayee said the SEZ policy will help develop new townships with modern infrastructure and allow the industry to compete globally. That will happen because producing on a large scale in well-integrated units cuts costs.

 Assocham believes equity options could be a solution, but jobs for a member of the displaced family will help. 

 The farmer should be given the first right to have an equity stake in the SEZ project. Also, at least one member of each family displaced should be re-deployed. The farmer may be offered a monetary compensation, said Venugopal Dhoot, president-elect of Assocham.

 Seshasayee agreed with Dhoots proposal, saying farmers always have the first right to equity. We are of the view that 15 per cent of the total land value should be offered to farmers as equity at prevailing market rates. 

 The CII chief said the state government could also offer displaced farmers other pieces of cultivable land. 

 Dhoot said the policy should ensure that special zones prove beneficial to all. Let us try and work out a tripartite agreement between the government, industry and farmers.

 Habil F. Khorakiwala, the new president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), believes the SEZ issue was being blown out of proportion. He said the industry requires only 1 per cent of the 162 million hectares of arable land in the country. 

 The 237 SEZs that have been approved so far require only about 34,500 hectares. The countrys total land area is 297 million hectares, according to World Bank estimates. 

 Smaller SEZs

 The group of ministers on SEZ will consider a proposal to limit the size of these zones to ensure that large tracts of fertile land dont need to be taken over for industrial ventures, sources said. A higher compensation could also be part of a revised policy.

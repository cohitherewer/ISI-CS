 London, March 24: Shilpa Shetty has put in an offer on a 1.5 million house in London, it has been reported.

 The reason given is that the winner of Celebrity Big Brother has decided she needs a base here in the UK as she wades through offers for TV, film and advertising deals. 

 Shilpa is apparently smitten with the luxury five-bed property in the trendy Hoxton area of north London. 

 She has put in an offer on the house, which includes a secluded west-facing garden, three bathrooms and two reception rooms. 

 After the racist bullying row on the show, Shilpa has been flooded with offers of work, the Daily Star said yesterday. They include chat shows, film work, book deals and advertising contracts, with the chance to launch her own perfume.

 A source said: Shilpa feels the furore of the racism storm is finally coming to an end and that she can finally spend more time in Britain to pursue her career here. Big Brother was always meant to get her the publicity so she could launch a TV career here. The press she got was more than she could ever dream of, but it was just the wrong type. 

 The source said Shilpa did not want to be seen as cashing in on her row with former housemates Jade Goody, 25, and other members of her gang. The actress has been in India since, except for a few engagements in London. 

 But he added: Shilpa now believes enough time has passed for all that to have died down, but does not want to leave it so long the British public forget about her.

 The source added it was also important for Shilpa to move to a multi-ethnic area in London. 

 He said: Shilpa has put in a very good offer on the house. It is a superb property but she has not forgotten her roots. It is right in the heart of one of the most multi-ethnic areas of London. She has loved spending time in Britain and cant wait to come back. 

 In London terms, 1.5 million will get her a reasonable property but to move into a biggish house in an exclusive area, she will need to pay at least 4-5 million. 

 It makes sense for Shilpa to invest in a London property even if Mumbai remains her main base. The property will escalate in value.

 Another source close to Shilpa was more cautious when approached by The Telegraph and would only say: Shes thinking about it. People are advising her to buy but she has only started her career in Britain.

 After horror, a different ordeal

 Panipat, Feb. 19: There were no tears, just blank stares. And the stench of death.

 At the Civil Hospital here, where bodies of the blast victims have been kept for identification, relatives trickled in the charred bodies triggering horror, and, for some, a faint ray of hope.

 Thirteen of the injured had been rushed here, but 12 of them were later shifted to Delhi. 

 Atiqur Rehman from Delhi was desperately hunting for cousin Islahuddin from Lahore. 

 The bodies are unrecognisable. I can only pray to Allah that he is safe, he said, his face buried in his hands.

 Shamim Khan from Delhi came looking for sister Arfa Bano and niece Pappan. Their names did not figure on the list of those who were on the train to Atari, but Shamim wanted to be sure. 

 As she stood waiting for some clue to come her way, a group of people rushed out of the morgue, holding handkerchiefs to their noses. The stench from the pile of bodies prompted some to throw up.

 A doctor was spraying perfume across the room. If I stop spraying, the stench will overpower anyone coming inside even if they have masks on, he said. 

 But for Rukshana and Rana Shaukat Ali, the stench has pervaded their lives for ever.

 The couple from Pakistan lost four of their children. Rukshana could only save one-year-old Aksha.

 There was a loud bang followed by what seemed to be some sort of a gas and then cries for help. The smoke suffocated us, and before we knew what was happening, the fire was on us. I picked up Aksha and rushed towards the door. Once outside, I realised my other children were inside. But it was too late, Rukshana said as she and her surviving family were led into a van that would take them to Delhi for treatment.

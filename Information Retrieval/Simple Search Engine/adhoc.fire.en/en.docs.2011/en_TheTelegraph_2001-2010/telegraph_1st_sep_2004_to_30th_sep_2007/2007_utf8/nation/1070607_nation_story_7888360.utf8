 Migrants face tough UK law

 London: System shift

 London, June 6: The British government today proposed an Australian-style points system to decide who should be let in, and tougher deportation rules for those who enter illegally or overstay. 

 The plans were outlined in a consultation paper on immigration issued by the home office. 

 The paper has invited suggestions on simplifying the Border and Immigration Agencys legal framework. Concern over immigration has increased because of fears that radical Islamic preachers have come to Britain and are attempting to brainwash young Muslims into taking up terrorism. 

 But Britains human rights organisations have fought attempts by the home office and police to return suspected terrorists to their countries because of fears they could face torture back home.

 Supporters of tougher action refer to London sarcastically as Londonistan. They say the government has allowed terror groups to strike roots in Britain. 

 However, in setting up a points system based, for example, on age, qualifications and family ties with Britain the government appears to have been less fair to junior Indian doctors, some Indian groups have alleged. 

 The doctors were encouraged to come and take qualification tests in the UK but now find themselves under pressure to leave. 

 Because of the actions of a minority, the Muslim population of 1.6 million feels under pressure. The government has kept them in mind while suggesting the legal changes. 

 Indian businessmen bringing investment into Britain are welcome, though. Many are setting up offices in London. 

 The governments policy was defended by Liam Byrne, the immigration minister, who said: Our plan is to simplify laws that date back to the early 1970s. I want a clear and simple legal system for fast but fair decisions. The British public and newcomers alike want to be clear about the rules and responsibilities. All of us want those who have no right to be here to be clear of the consequences. 

 The government will receive feedback from the public on the paper till August 21.

NATION BRIEFS

 New Delhi, April 22 (PTI): The Supreme Court has slammed a bank for compulsorily retiring a woman employee after she went on medical leave and denying her pension benefits.

 Satya Srinath had pleaded with Syndicate Bank that she could not report for work due to health problems. As it was the bank that imposed the retirement in 1992, it cannot deny her benefits by adopting a plea that they were not available to employees who undertook voluntary retirement, the bench said.

 New Delhi (PTI): Historian Sumit Sarkar was admitted to Apollo Hospital on Saturday. He fell in his house and hurt his head, hospital sources said. His condition is stable, they added. 

 Mumbai (PTI): A Delhi-based organisation has filed a PIL in Bombay High Court arguing that the use of the name Goa in a gutka brand creates a false impression that the brand is associated with the state or its denizens. The petitioners had earlier approached Delhi High Court with this PIL, but the court had said it had no jurisdiction in the case. 

 Giridih (PTI): A policeman was killed and four persons were injured when a police vehicle blew up in a landmine blast triggered by Maoists near a village. The policemen were returning after distributing clothes and other articles as part of a community service scheme. 

 New Delhi (PTI): A widow has sought registration of a case against her father-in-law and two TV channels for allegedly damaging her reputation by accusing her of killing her husband. A city court will consider her application on May 5.

 Sagar (PTI): Four persons were killed and three critically injured in a blast in a jeep carrying explosives at Karrapur village in Madhya Pradesh on Sunday. According to the passengers, the explosives were meant for deepening a well, police said.

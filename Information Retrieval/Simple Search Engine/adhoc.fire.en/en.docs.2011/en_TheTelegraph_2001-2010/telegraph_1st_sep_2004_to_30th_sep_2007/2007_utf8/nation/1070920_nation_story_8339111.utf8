 Bengal CPM to stand up to Karat

 The first round may have decisively gone Prakash Karats way. But some extraordinary signals now suggest that leaders who matter in the Bengal unit of the party may make the going tough for the CPM general secretary at the politburo and the central committee meetings in Calcutta later this month. 

 Indications are that the Bengal leaders, who had been generally submissive to Karats line at the last central committee meeting in Delhi, would question his wisdom more forcefully in Calcutta. 

 That Jyoti Basu would do so had been widely anticipated by the Bengal leaders. Basu himself had dropped broad hints of his differences with Karats strategy. While routinely echoing the politburos line on the nuclear deal, he made two things clear. First, the opposition to the nuclear deal was one thing and withdrawing support to the UPA government on the issue was quite another. Second, unlike Karat, he does not approve of a final separation from the UPA because he does not think the general secretarys idea of a third front has any realistic chance of coming into being in the near future. 

 While Basus position was not unknown, it is the signals emanating from some others that suggest a significant change in the thinking of the Bengal unit. It is now known that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Biman Bose had not questioned Karats line at the politburo meeting in Delhi. Even at the central committee meeting that followed it, none of the members from Bengal, except Nirupam Sen, expressed any misgivings about the politburos no-holds-barred crusade against the UPA government on the issue. 

 There are indications now that many more of the Bengal leaders could rally round Basu during the party sessions in Calcutta and try to force Karat to concede some ground. The signals came from the chief minister and from some other senior leaders over the past few days. 

 Strictly speaking, Bhattacharjee was only repeating his old idea when he spoke of the need for nuclear power for Bengals economic development. 

 In fact, the Bengal leaders thinking on nuclear power predates Bhattacharjees plea for it. The first time a committee, headed by a chief secretary, was set up by the state government to examine the issue of nuclear power for Bengal was during Basus tenure as chief minister. 

 Similarly, there is apparently nothing new about the plan for Sen or the chief minister to visit the US to explore potential investments in Bengal. Both had earlier said the party had a problem with US imperialism but absolutely none with American investments in Bengal. 

 But the timing of the chief ministers remarks on nuclear power and his reference to his own and Sens planned visit to the US makes it so politically charged. A senior leader and member of the state secretariat conceded that the remarks were rather odd in the context of the Lefts current anti-America campaign. 

 But why are the Bengal leaders, who acquiesced in Karats line till recently, singing a different tune now? 

 The explanation in Bengal CPM circles goes like this. There were always reservations in the minds of the Bengal leaders about Karats uncompromising line on the future of the UPA-Left relationship. The foremost argument of leaders like Bhattacharjee and Sen was that the confrontation would derail their largely successful drive for Bengals industrialisation. And, they are convinced that development, rather than ideology, matters in Bengals politics today.

 But they were hopeful, possibly like Karat himself, that the Lefts pressure would work and force the Congress to go slow on the nuclear deal. As the Congresss position hardened, the Bengal leaders increasingly felt that the party had more to lose than the Congress from the gamble. 

 The main argument at one stage was that the party and others in the Left not only have a historic duty to oppose the nuclear deal but also have a rare opportunity by virtue of an unprecedented 60 seats in the Lok Sabha to do so.

 But as the Bengal leaders counted the real losses as opposed to the moral gain, they accepted that discretion was the better part of valour. The Bengal leaders did not need any media projections to tell them that the Lefts strength in the next Lok Sabha would be drastically reduced in the event of a snap poll in the next few months. 

 As the Bengal state secretariat member put it: It may be the nuclear deal in other states; but in the next polls here, the issues will relate to Singur, Nandigram and land. Besides, we have our doubts if the nuclear deal is the issue over which we can justify to the people the withdrawal of our support to the government. 

 There are thus strong signals that the Bengal leaders will speak up more to question Karats strategy. Whether they can carry the central committee with them is, however, another question.

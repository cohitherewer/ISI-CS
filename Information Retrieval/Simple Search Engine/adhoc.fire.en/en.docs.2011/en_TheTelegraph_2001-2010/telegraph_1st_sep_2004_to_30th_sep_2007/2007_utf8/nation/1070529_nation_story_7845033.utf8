 Gujarat cop wants free hand

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Geeta Johri

 Ahmedabad, May 28: Geeta Johri, the Gujarat cop probing the fake encounter case, has served an ultimatum to her boss: either give more powers or ask the CBI to investigate.

 The inspector-general (CID) said this in a note to .P. Mathur, additional director-general in her department, when she found she could not arrest a police officer in connection with the case.

 However, Mathur denied any such development. But sources confirmed that Johri had written to him saying if the investigation were to remain with her, she should be given a free hand.

 Johri is believed to be frustrated at being denied permission last week to arrest deputy superintendent of police (CID) N.K. Amin, who has gone on medical leave.

 The chief investigating officer and deputy superintendent of police (CID), Gambhir Pandharia, is understood to have told Johri that if she wanted him to arrest Amin, she should give orders in writing.

 Mathur wanted Johri to keep him posted about the investigation into Sheikh Sohrabuddins killing though the Supreme Court had directed that she would independently conduct the probe and report to the court.

 Apparently, Mathur is toeing the line of the Gujarat governments counsel, Hemantika Wahi, who had earlier asked Johri to report to the additional DGP.

 According to the government counsels interpretation, the Supreme Court had barred only the DGP from interfering in the case and not said that Johri should not report to her immediate boss, the additional DGP.

 Amin was interrogated last Tuesday the day Nathusinh Jadeja, a driver with the anti-terror squad, surrendered in a local court. Jadeja later retracted his statement recorded by DIG (CID) Rajnish Rai.

 In his statement, which Rai got videographed, Jadeja had confirmed that Amin was present when Kauser Bi, Sohrabuddins wife, was killed and her body burnt in Ilol, the village of deputy inspector-general D.G. Vanzara, who is now in custody.

 Vanzara and two other IPS officers, including one from Rajasthan, were arrested by Rai, who was probing the fake encounter case before it was handed over to Johri.

 The Gujarat government has admitted in the Supreme Court that Kauser Bi was killed. But the CID is yet to establish how she was killed. It was in this connection that Johri wanted to arrest Amin, an influential officer, but did not get cooperation from her superiors and subordinates.

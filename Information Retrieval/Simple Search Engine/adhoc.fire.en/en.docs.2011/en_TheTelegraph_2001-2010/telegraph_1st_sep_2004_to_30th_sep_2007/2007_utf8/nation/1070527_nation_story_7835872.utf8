 Mumbai, May 26: Sreelata Choubey takes the Borivali local at nine every morning. Today, the 34-year-old decided to stay home.

 Glenver Petrodia, 25, would have told her that she had been wise. The call centre employee, waiting for a train to Virar, was stranded at Malad station for over 45 minutes. 

 Meera Jayshankars plight was worse. She had been waiting for a train for over an hour with her howling five-year-old son, who could not bear to stand in the sweltering heat any more.

 Several local train commuters between Borivali and Virar had a harrowing time today when work on tracks snapped what they call their lifeline.

 Railway tracks are being constructed between the Mumbai suburbs ahead of the monsoon. This is the third phase of a mammoth project to quadruple the number of tracks on the line. 

 The work started at 11 last night and will continue till the early hours of Monday. 

 Twenty-five per cent of Mumbais local trains, on the western section between Churchgate and Virar, were either cancelled or terminated at earlier stations like Goregaon and Malad. 

 The office-goers there are an estimated 30 lakh every day in this section were the worst sufferers. However, many gave work a miss and suburban railway platforms wore a deserted look.

 We are quadrupling the tracks between Borivali and Virar, which witnesses the maximum amount of traffic, so that in future we can run more trains in this sector, said Vivek Sahai, assistant general manager, Western Railways.

 I agree this will cause inconvenience to our passengers for a couple of days but in the long run, this will be beneficial, he said.

 Most commuters agree the new tracks would be of great help. We had been informed in advance, but its difficult to survive without something you are so used to. I cannot afford taxi fares, said Abhishek Gupta, a Virar resident who works in Worli.

 This will be the last mega block in this sector and all train services are likely to resume at 6 am on Monday.

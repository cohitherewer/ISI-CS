 SUVs: love and ruin of gangs

 RASHEED KIDWAI

Bhopal, 

 July 22: Gabbar may have preferred horses but todays 

 Chambal dacoits ride SUVs.

 With the killing of Dadua in Chitrakoot this morning, the police now hope to lay their hands on his fleet of cars, jeeps and SUVs, hidden away in his jungle lairs as well as safehouses in the villages and towns.

 A paper prepared by Madhya Pradesh police says the 25-odd gangs in the ravines possess over 2,000 vehicles, mostly Marshall and Mahindra jeeps. This is over and above the 1,800-odd vehicles seized by the state polices anti-dacoit cell in the past two years following 130-odd encounters.

 The police seized 1,133 vehicles in 2005, another 451 last year and 243 in the first quarter of this year, with each encounter or raid often leading to a haul of five to 10 four-wheelers.

 Most of these gangs are obsessed with four-wheel drive and fancy SUVs. So each time they receive ransom, they buy the latest models, an officer said. Some are received as gifts, too, and some are snatched.

 The speed of these vehicles place the police at a disadvantage. While they speed away in their fancy vehicles, our men struggle in rickety jeeps, the officer said.

 The obsession has prompted the gangs to change their tactics and, the police believe, played a key role in the downfall of leading bandits.

 In the last five years or so, most of these dacoits switched to pakad (kidnapping) to make easy money. It changed their image they were no longer seen as rebels against an oppressive social order but as a greedy bunch sharing in the spoils of a corrupt system, the officer said.

 Once they lost popular support on caste lines, it became easier to find informers willing to identify them and their whereabouts, an inspector-general of police said.

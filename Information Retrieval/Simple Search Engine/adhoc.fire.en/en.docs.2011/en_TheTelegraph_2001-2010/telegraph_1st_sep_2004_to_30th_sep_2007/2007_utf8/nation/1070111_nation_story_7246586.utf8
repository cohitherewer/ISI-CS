 West wakes up to power of chilli 

 AMIT ROY 

 London, Jan. 10: Scientists hope to unlock the chilli factor in Indian food in the battle against cancer.

 Although lifestyle changes in India means cancer is more common than it used to be, spicy food is thought to be one reason why the disease is relatively less prevalent among Indians than among westerners. 

 At the heart of a possible solution is the substance called capsaicin, the ingredient which gives the chilli its characteristically hot, burning taste. 

 Although generations of Indians have suffered through over-indulgence, it seems that modest consumption of chilli does nothing but good. 

 This wont come as a surprise to people like conductor Zubin Mehta who carries a little pot of chilli powder in his pocket. Actress Zohra Sehgal, who is in her nineties, demands chillies wherever she goes. So does director Shekhar Kapur. 

 The British scientist responsible for the startling new research is Dr Timothy Bates, a member of the Medical Research Council College of Experts, an internationally renowned researcher into anti-cancer drug development. The research has been done by a group of scientists at Nottingham, Cardiff and Shanghai. 

 Bates said: This is incredibly exciting and may explain why people living in countries like Mexico and India, who traditionally eat a diet which is very spicy, tend to have lower incidences of many cancers that are prevalent in the western world. 

 That modest consumption of chillies is desirable has been known to Indians for centuries, but the West has been discovering its medicinal properties only in recent years. It is said that chillies help make Indian food addictive. 

 According to Bates, who was previously attached to Nottingham University but has also worked for the Institute of Neurology at London University, scientists could use capsaicin to develop drugs that basically kill cancer cells. 

 Bates, who has written in optimistic terms in a learned weekly journal called Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, said capsaicin could be used to destroy tumours with few or no side effects for the patient. 

 He found that the family of compounds to which capsaicin belongs vanilloids can kill a cancer cell by attacking its powerhouse, or mitochondria. By binding proteins in the cells powerhouse, the compound triggers apoptosis, or natural cell death, without harming the healthy surrounding cells. 

 Researchers tested the compound in a laboratory on human lung cancer cells, which produced startling results. A similar test on pancreatic cancer one of the most difficult forms of cancer to treat also produced results hailed as highly significant. 

 As these compounds attack the very heart of the tumour cells, we believe that we have in effect discovered a fundamental Achilles heel for all cancers, Bates said. 

 He went on: To develop a new drug costs pharmaceutical companies in the region of $800 million and takes up to 10 years. To develop a drug for a secondary medical purpose costs far less, so compounds such as capsaicin and the others we have identified could mean big business. 

 He pointed out: Capsaicin, for example, is already found in treatments for muscle strain and psoriasis which raises the question of whether an adapted topical treatment could be used to treat certain types of skin cancer.

 We are currently seeking industrial partners to enable these agents to be used in clinical trials with colleagues from Nottingham and other centres in the UK to treat a variety of cancers both in adults and, in particular, in childrens cancers, where their younger cells are already primed to die by apoptosis, making them more susceptible to these agents. 

 He could make curry even more popular with his remark: It is also possible that cancer patients or those at risk of developing cancer could be advised to eat a diet which is richer in spicy foods to help treat or prevent the disease. 

 What would irritate entrepreneurs like Yusuf Hamied of Cipla is western pharmaceutical giants patenting chilli concoctions and selling them back to India.

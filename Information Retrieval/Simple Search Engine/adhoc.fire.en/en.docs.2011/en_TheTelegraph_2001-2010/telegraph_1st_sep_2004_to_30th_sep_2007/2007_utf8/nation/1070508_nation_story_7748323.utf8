 No survivors, only a huge water-filled crater

 May 7: None of the 114 people on board the Kenya Airways flight survived its crash into a thick mangrove swamp over the weekend, an official said today after seeing the water-filled crater the plane left.

 Asked whether anyone survived, Luc Ndjodo, a local government official in charge of the recovery effort, said: No.

 Ndjodo, who surveyed the site, about as large as a soccer field, saw no survivors. I was there. I saw none.

 The plane was submerged in murky, orange-brown water on which scraps of metal and plastic floated. Workers placed bodies and body parts found nearby on stretchers and carried them to ambulances that had driven as close as vehicles could get, about a 20-minute hike to the site.

 Much of the debris, some of it hanging from trees, was shredded beyond recognition. But small items were intact a white tennis shoe, a black purse of braided leather, an orange-and-blue length of cloth a woman might have worn as a skirt.

 Thomas Sobakam, chief of meteorology for the Douala airport, said the plane nose-dived into the swamp and disintegrated on impact.

 Relatives of the 15 Indians who were on board are still struggling to come to terms with the tragedy. 

 I am told they have located the plane and there are no survivors. But I am still praying they are safe, said Murali, the brother of Madhusudhan, who was on board with wife Bhagya, 35, and daughter Poojitha, 10. 

 Murali, preparing to fly to Nairobi, cant summon the courage to board the flight. I hope he is not called to identify the bodies, says a relative at the familys home in Bangalores JP Nagar. 

 The 42-year-old accountant worked for a Cameroon drugs company. His wife was to stay back for the education of their daughter in Bangalore.

 Ruby Mary Paul, 30, from Mangalore, was returning home from Cameroon, where she went to visit her relatives. Kevin Joseph Nigli and wife Shirly, natives of Kerala, were on their way to meet their son in Bangalore. 

 In Kochi, the relatives of the Niglis said they still had no confirmation on the couple. They frantically surfed channels for information from the crash site. A pall of gloom descended on the family of N. Gireesh, from Kannur district.

 The family of George Joseph, 59, and wife Maria, 55, also plunged into despair. The Kochi couple were coming home for the wedding of their son Vipin. Relatives said Vipin has left for the crash site.

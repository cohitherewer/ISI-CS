New Delhi, Sept. 7: Lessons in goondagiri, dadagiri and booth-capturing could be made part of the syllabus, the Supreme Court said today, taking a swipe at the government for its failure to rid campuses of vicious politics.

 The whole idea (behind the September 22, 2006, order banning political funding of elections) was to see that college elections are free from leaderssee that students are students first and leaders later. Instead, we have whole-time leaders and part-time students, the apex court said. 

 The court was hearing several petitions by students and their representative groups seeking compliance with the Lyngdoh Committee recommendations on keeping competitive politics out of universities. 

 Students spend lakhs to become leaders in college elections. A student leader has to be a role model. But instead, we find so many heads are broken (literally) to become leaders, the bench headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat said.

 The court directed the Centre to submit within two weeks a report on the extent to which universities have complied with its orders on student polls.

 The court refused to interfere in the Delhi University polls, which were held on September 5, but made its displeasure known. The academic atmosphere should not suffer for elections. Non-compliance of court orders is visible all over. Banners can be seen everywhere and walls are plastered with posters.

 Then came the goonda sting. Maybe it is time to have a new syllabus with goondagiri, dadagiri and booth-capturing. You (students) are there to study or what?

 The Lyngdoh panel had set an age limit for college elections and suggested that only whole-time students with 75 per cent attendance be permitted to contest. The aim was to prevent political parties from propping up candidates 

 Barring students with a criminal record, a ban on funding from political parties and a Rs 5,000 campaign expense cap were among the key proposals.

 Large universities, such as Delhi and Mumbai, were urged to hold indirect polls. Delhi University still went ahead with its student polls. 

 The SFI, the CPMs students wing, has filed a PIL in Delhi High Court seeking implementation of the Lyngdoh recommendations. A complete student should study and struggle. That is the SFIs political belief, Albina Shakeel, its Delhi state secretary, said, on the courts comments. 

 Amrita Dhawan, the outgoing president of the Delhi University Students Union, said her parent body, the Congress-backed National Students Union of India, completely backed the Lyngdoh recommendations, but is against too much administrative interference. So is the SFI.

 In the Delhi University polls, the BJP-supported Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad suffered the most. Nakul Bhardwaj, their presidential candidate, had to be removed after he was found to be overage.

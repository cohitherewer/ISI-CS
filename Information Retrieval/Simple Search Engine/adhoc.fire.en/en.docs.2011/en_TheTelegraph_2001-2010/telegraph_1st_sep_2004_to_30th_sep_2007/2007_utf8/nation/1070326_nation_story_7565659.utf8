 Macaca catapults dad to Democrat chair

 K.P. NAYAR 

 S.R. Sidarth

 Washington, March 25: It is not unusual for sons and daughters of politician-fathers or mothers to ride piggyback on their parents into political office, but among Indian Americans the reverse is turning out to be true.

 At least one ethnic Indian father is rising to national fame in the US because of his son and may have a role in the election of the next US President in 2008.

 The Democratic National Committees chairman, Howard Dean, last week appointed Shekar Narasimhan a co-chair of the partys Indo-American Leadership Council (IALC).

 Narasimhan is the father of a 20-year-old ethnic Indian student here, who enabled Democrats, by a freak, to gain the one-vote majority they needed in last Novembers election for control of the US Senate. 

 It all started in August last year, when one of Virginias most popular Republican politicians, sitting US Senator and a possible front-runner to replace George W. Bush as President in 2009, made a politically fatal mistake. 

 George Allen spotted a 20-year-old American student of Indian origin trailing him on his Senate re-election campaign with a video camera. In a moment of politically incorrect misjudgement, Allen referred to S.R. Sidarth as a macaca in front of 100-odd white people. 

 Macaca is a strain of tropical monkey, but the term is also used as a racial slur in some parts of the world. Sidarth was then working as a volunteer videographer with Allens Democratic rival James Webb, a common practice here to catch a candidate making a faux pas, which can then be used by an opponent in the campaign. 

 This fellow here over here with the yellow shirt, Macaca, or whatever his name is. He is with my opponent. He is following us around everywhere, Allen said then at a meeting.

 Assuming that Sidharth was an immigrant, Allen added: Let us give a welcome to Macaca, here. Welcome to America and the real world of Virginia.

 Actually, the Indian youth was born in Virginias Fairfax County and educated in the state. The use of the racial epithet exploded in the face of Allen, who was then considered a sure winner in the Senate race and a frontrunner for the White House in 2008. 

 It set in motion a train of events, including investigation and portrayal of the Senator as a racial bigot, allegedly in his college days, and revelation that Allen had Jewish ancestry. 

 In the end, his Demoractic opponent, who was an underdog till the macaca moment, defeated Allen in a stunning upset. Allens defeat was a national event because that gave Democrats control of the Senate.

 The IALC was established in 2004 to streamline an increasingly active role played by ethnic Indians in US politics. It is a vehicle to channelise the loyalty, dedication, and generous contributions of the Indian-American community to the Democratic Party and to provide a platform for political engagement and a forum for the exchange of ideas for Indian-American Democrats, according to a press release issued on behalf of Dean.

 With the tide of public opinion running strongly against Republican incumbency in the White House, there is widespread expectation that a Democrat may be elected President in 2008. The Democrats won control of both House of Congress in November last year. All of this will mean an enhancement of the role of Indian-American Democrats in US politics.

 Narasimhan is a banker by profession and CEO of a public company based in Virginia. A long-time Democrat, he is actively involved with the Sri Siva Vishnu Temple, one of the largest Hindu temples in the US, and is the founding chair of the Campaign for Affordable Housing. Dean also nominated Mahinder Tak, a retired physician from Maryland as another co-chair and Sunita Gupta Leeds of Washington as chairperson of IALCs advisory board.

 In December last year, Global Language Monitor, a non-profit group that studies word usage, designated macaca as the most politically incorrect word in 2006.

 A flicker of hope in hunt for ET

 Chidambaram, Jan. 6: New developments in radio astronomy may give those searching for extra-terrestrial intelligence (SETI) a flicker of hope.

 Govind Swarup, the doyen of radio astronomy in India and emeritus professor at the National Centre for Radio Physics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, has said the use of radio telescopes with much higher sensitivity has only increased curiosity on whether we are alone in this universe or not.

 Though no sign of life as man understands it has been detected in any other planet, we cannot give up the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence, he added.

 Where there is energy, air, water and soil, there may exist life and intelligence, the professor said in a special address on the theme Are We Alone? at the Indian Science Congress. Even if SETI is not science per se, mans fascination for it has not ceased, he added. Recent initiatives in radio astronomy in India and a global project have further intensified interest in the subject.

 Referring to the Giant Metre Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) set up 80 km north of Pune by the National Centre for Radio Physics, Swarup said it seemed incredible to many that India could design and build such a huge telescope which can be used for SETI.

 The GMRT has 30 dishes each having a diameter of 45 metres scattered over on an area of 25 km. It is a wonder that we are able to rotate these antennas both with respect to the earth and the stars daily, he said.

 However, Swarup made it clear that the GMRTs objective was to do basic research in radio astronomy and radio astrophysics. So, forays into SETI could at best be a by-product, he said. With the addition of sophisticated instruments like the digital spectrometer, there was a proposal to augment the GMRT facility for SETI, the professor added.

 India, being a global leader in software, could put together a cluster of powerful computers to strengthen the SETI probes and develop a radio receiver to pick up very low levels of sound, said Swarup. This would help because any extra-terrestrial intelligence, if it were to transmit any message at all will send it in a very narrow band, he told an audience of scientists.

 At the global level, a challenging project to build an international telescope for radio astronomy was being taken up, Swarup said. The project to build this powerful telescope, expected to cost $1.50 billion, was being undertaken by 17 countries including India, China, the US and the UK.

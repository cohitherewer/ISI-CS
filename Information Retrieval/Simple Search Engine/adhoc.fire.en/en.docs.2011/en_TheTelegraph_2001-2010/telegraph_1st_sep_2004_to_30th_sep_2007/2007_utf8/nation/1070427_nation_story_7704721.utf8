 Trafficking mud on TRS boss

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, April 26: The trafficking mud has started flying at the Telengana titan.

 Thrown out of the Telengana Rashtra Samiti after being accused in the emigration racket, A. Narendra today tried to turn the tables on his former party president, K. Chandrasekhar Rao. He alleged that Rao, along with two other TRS leaders, had ferried 15 Gujaratis to the US on fake passports and visas. 

 Narendra said the TRS chief had also taken money from a Delhi businessman to make him a Rajya Sabha member. 

 Rao suspended the former Union minister last night after he was accused of involvement in the human trafficking case and misuse of passports of two party MPs.

 Addressing a news conference today, Narendra said Rao had illegally sent eight Gujaratis to the US last year when he was Union labour minister by misusing his office, he said.

 Narendra vowed to expose Raos corrupt practices with proof in a few days.

 The other TRS leaders in Narendras gun sight were MP T. Madhusudhan Reddy and legislator Harish Rao, who is the nephew of the TRS president.

 Narendra said Reddy had sent a Gujarati woman, her son and daughter to the US last year under passports and visas of his family members.

 Harish Rao had sent a Gujarati lady and her son to the US on fake visas and passports, he added.

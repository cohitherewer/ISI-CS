 Star chef in fake suit

 New York, June 20 (AP): British celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay is accused of faking scenes for a new reality television show in which he was supposed to makeover failing restaurants in a weeks time as his confrontations with staff were recorded, according to a lawsuit.

 A former general manager at Dillons in Manhattan, Martin R. Hyde, said Ramsay featured the Indian-American restaurant as part of a new series entitled Ramsays Kitchen Nightmares, to be distributed by Fox Broadcasting Co.

 Dillons, a restaurant in Manhattans theatre district, caters to off-Broadway theatre-goers with food and live entertainment.

 Hydes lawsuit filed yesterday said Ramsay falsely claimed meat was spoiled, used a defective chair to imply that Dillons furniture was shoddy and even hired actors to pose as customers to make the restaurant look busy at the end of the week.

 Hyde also claimed Ramsay, known for foul-mouthed outbursts and the star of Foxs reality competition Hells Kitchen, humiliated him and forced him to quit his job to avoid further abuse. He asked for millions of dollars in damages and a court order to stop the show from airing.

 Ramsay spokesman James Curich said he could not comment on the lawsuit because he had not yet seen it. 

 As for allegations about fabrications, Curich said: It is a reality show and as far as I know its not something they do.

 Andrew Blackmore, a manager at Dillons, said he had signed a release stating that he could not talk about the show to the media.

 A year ago, Ramsay won a libel action in London against a newspaper that accused him of faking scenes on his Kitchen Nightmares reality show when he worked to turn around a struggling bistro in northern England.

 Associated Newspapers Ltd, publisher of Evening Standard, agreed to print an apology and pay $138,000 in damages to Ramsay and the makers of his programme.

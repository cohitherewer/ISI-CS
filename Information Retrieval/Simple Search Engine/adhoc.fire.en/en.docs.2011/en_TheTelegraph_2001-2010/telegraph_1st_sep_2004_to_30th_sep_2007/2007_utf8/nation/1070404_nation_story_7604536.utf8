 Tremor

 Srinagar, April 3: Memories of the deadly 2005 quake revisited Kashmir today after early-morning tremors drove people in hordes out of their homes, reports our special correspondent.

 The tremor, lasting 15 seconds and measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale, struck at 9.05 am, almost the same time when nearly 1,000 people were killed, mostly in Uri and Tanghdar, on October 8, 2005.

 Tremors were felt in Poonch, Rajouri and other parts of Jammu, too. But there is no report of deaths or major damage to property.

 Thank God, nobody has died and there is no report of any loss to property from anywhere, Kashmirs divisional commissioner Basharat Ahmad Dhar said.

 A panic-stricken woman, Safina Akhtar, was injured after she jumped out of the window of her house in Uri. The memories of the last quake are still fresh, so people panicked, Dhar said. Safina has been shifted to hospital.

 As in 2005, the residents of Uri and Tanghdar had a traumatic time. Panic gripped the area and most people were on roads. Many thought the quake was as big as it was last time, said Javed Ahmad, a police official in Uri.

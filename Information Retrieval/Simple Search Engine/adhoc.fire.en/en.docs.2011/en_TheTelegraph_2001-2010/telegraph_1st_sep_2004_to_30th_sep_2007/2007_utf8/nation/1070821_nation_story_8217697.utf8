 Indore, Aug. 20: A local court today issued an arrest warrant against actress Priyanka Chopras father Ashok for alleged threat calls to her former secretary through underworld don Chhota Shakeel.

 The former Miss World and her father have denied the charge.

 Priyanka and her former secretary Prakash Jaju, who fell out after a dispute over financial dealings, had been filing complaints and counter-complaints over the past one-and-a-half years. Jaju, who claims over Rs 1 crore from Priyanka and her family, says he had entered into an agreement with them to promote the actress but they had refused to pay the money.

 Priyanka had registered a case in Mumbai against Jaju for allegedly threatening her and using abusive language. In a counter-complaint at Mhow near Bhopal, where Priyankas father served in the army, Jaju claimed the actress had threatened him with dire consequences if the dispute wasnt settled.

 Earlier this month, Madhya Pradesh High Courts Indore bench had acquitted Priyanka from the charge of threatening Jaju. But the case against her father continued in the lower court resulting in todays warrant.

 At the last hearing, Ashok was asked to appear on August 18 but failed to show up. His lawyer Chandrashekar Raikwar submitted an application before the judge, saying his client was ill. However, Jajus advocate Sanjay Tiwari said Ashok and Priyanka recently appeared on TV singing songs.

 Tiwari alleged that Ashok was trying to avoid court proceedings. Justice U.S. Movel then issued a non-bailable warrant against Ashok directing it to be complied with by September 19.

 Earlier, sources in Indore police had said they had probed Jajus charge of underworld threats but had not found enough evidence.

 Jajus association with Priyanka dates back to 2000 when she was crowned Miss World. 

 The small-time film distributor came through a private agency, Akshay Management Company, to work as her secretary. A formal agreement between Priyanka and the agency was signed on February 15, 2001, in Mumbai with a clear understanding that the agreement could be cancelled by either side on a notice of two months.

 Within a few months, differences arose between them and the contract ended on May 6, 2001.

 But a year later, after rumours of the actresss romantic alliance with a leading actor began doing the rounds, Priyanka decided to again avail herself of Jajus services. 

 According to Priyanka, she later came to know a different side of Jaju when she noticed that he had started taking a personal interest in her. If her version is to be believed, many unwanted and romantic SMSes caused her harassment. On one occasion, Jaju reportedly barged into her room, drunk. In July 2004, he resigned as her secretary.

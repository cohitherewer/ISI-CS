 Son locks up 80-year-old for 2 years

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 6: A sarpanch who is feared in his village locked up his 80-year-old father for two years on the pretext that he was mentally ill.

 Duda Makhwana was rescued from a room adjoining the cowshed only after son Jethabhai, whom his neighbours described as a ruthless man, was arrested on a murder charge.

 During his confinement, Duda had been made to sleep on a pile of straw, was given no clothes and had only a tattered blanket to cover himself, said Mayur Jani, a resident.

 Jethabhai who was elected sarpanch of Navagaon in Panchmahals district, 60km from Godhra, last year is accused of stabbing a political rival dead on Thursday night.

 It was the neighbours and not police who freed Duda, villagers said. The old man, whom the police too described as mentally ill, has not been taken to a hospital for a diagnosis.

 Deputy superintendent of police M.B. Baranada confirmed that the 42-year-old sarpanch had been charged only with murder and not for locking his father up.

 Its a family matter. In this case, the police have no role to play, the officer said. I believe the villagers are taking care of the old man.

 The neighbours said that though they hadnt seen Duda for two years, they were too terrified of the sarpanch, a rich farmer, to ask him why. They alleged that Jethabhai used to harass and terrorise them.

 The police said that on Thursday night, Jethabhai had killed Shankar Harijan, 43, who had contested the panchayat election against him. He was arrested on Friday with his two brothers, who were at the scene of crime. Duda was rescued on Saturday.

 Sources said the sarpanch was close to the BJP and that the murdered man was a Congress supporter.

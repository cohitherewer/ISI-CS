 Delhi stops IIM lists

 - Ministry scuttles meet with directors, issues order 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 20: The IIMs today decided not to release the general-category admissions list tomorrow after the government scuttled an expected dialogue and imposed its will at the last minute.

 The six IIM directors were to meet human resource development ministry officials in Delhi today for clear-the-air talks, but the Centre surprised the B-schools with a directive last evening.

 It repeated the governments stand that the IIMs must not release the general list without the Other Backward Classes list. The Supreme Court, which has stayed the OBC quota, will hear the governments application against the stay on Monday.

 Some IIM directors, like Bangalores Prakash G. Apte, had already left for Delhi when their institutes received the ministrys order.

 The ministry, it is learnt, didnt officially announce the meeting. But without a tacit agreement, the directors wouldnt have spoken about it or left for the capital.

 The ministry may have deliberately delayed responding to the IIMs April 12 letter about releasing the general list tomorrow, sources suggested. It first denied having received the letter, then said there was no reason to reply.

 Last evenings order, faxed after 5.30, warned the B-schools against any unilateral decision even as it scuppered the talks.

 The government move will prolong the agony of the general students, many of whom might now seek admission to private B-schools.

 IIM Calcuttas chairman for admissions, Ashish Bhattacharya, suggested the delay will not mean that the institutes will lose the cream of the students. He said any student who opts out of a private institute after admission is entitled to a refund with only Rs 1,000 deducted.

 So if a student who has taken admission to a private institute later finds his name on the IIM admission list, he can join our course easily.

 The two big IIMs, Ahmedabad and Bangalore, had been the keenest to release the list tomorrow, while the three smaller IIMs Lucknow, Indore and Kozhikode were reluctant to annoy the Centre which controls their purse strings. Calcutta, third in the pecking order, had also taken a soft line.

 Sources in the smaller IIMs said there was no hurry to release the list since the academic session begins in end-June or early July.

 But IIM Ahmedabad sources said the preparatory programme for students from economically and socially backward backgrounds may be hit. Any significant delay in admissions may force the institute to cancel or reschedule the programme, which normally starts in end-May.

 If the court doesnt vacate the stay on Monday, however, the government may be forced to allow the B-schools to release the general list.

 Helpline

 IIM Bangalore has advised short-listed candidates, who participated in the second stage of admission process to visit its website from time to time for any major development related to admission. The web address is www.iimb.ernet.in.

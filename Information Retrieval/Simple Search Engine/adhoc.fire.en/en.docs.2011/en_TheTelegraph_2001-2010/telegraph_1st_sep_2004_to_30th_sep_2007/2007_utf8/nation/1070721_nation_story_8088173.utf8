 Power company gets jumbo jolt

 A tusker that came in contact with a live wire and died has given the state-run electricity transmission company in Karnataka a shock. 

 Three days after the male tusker in its prime died, the forest department has registered eight cases against Bangalore Electricity Supply Company and accused it of being responsible for killing an endangered wildlife species. 

 Among the charges are negligence, hunting, poaching and others under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. 

 The elephant, with tusks each a metre long, had come in contact with a sagging high transmission line cutting through the Bannerghatta forest range on the southern fringes of Bangalore. 

 Charges were levelled against the company after forest officials learnt that locals had complained to it about the low-hanging live wire a week before the animals death. 

 The department also found that the elephant actually died because of an electric shock and not after drinking illicit liquor brewed in nearby villages, as alleged by the transmission company. 

 In the last decade, 10 wild elephants, including nine tuskers, have fallen prey to live wires. 

 Coming: YSR blockbuster

 Viewers in Andhra will soon be treated to a Rs 65-crore blockbuster not from a film studio but from Y.S.R. Reddy Productions.

 The money will be spent on a publicity blitz that is part of the governments efforts to tell the people before the elections, two years away, what it has been up to in the past three years.

 The campaign, to be launched in August, is billed as one of the largest such exercises by a state government. 

 Vans will fan out across villages, carry equipment to screen films highlighting welfare schemes. Folk singers and cultural troupes will also be on board to add local flavour. A documentary filmmaker has been signed up. Channels that show the multi-episode film will be paid a fee.

 Drive along, under Metro

 Those driving near north Delhis Azadpur a couple of years from now will enjoy the unique experience of cruising on a flyover right under the Delhi Metro. Construction for the capitals first four-level flyover has started and should be complete by March 2009 in time for the Commonwealth Games a year later.

 An underpass a road below street level will link the Ring Road and the Outer Ring Road. An overpass, the conventional flyover, will run perpendicular to the underpass, along the Ring Road. 

 Street level rotary roads will facilitate traffic to the left or right. The fourth level meant for the Metro trains will run right above the overpass. This line of the Metro will connect Jahangirpuri to Delhi University. 

 Nearly 13,000 vehicles pass each hour through the busy Azadpur junction during peak traffic timings.

 Egg them on

 The National Egg Coordination Committee hasnt done a bad job of urging people to eat more eggs. But it could do well to recognise M. Karunanidhis personal contribution.

 Early this week, the Tamil Nadu chief minister declared that three eggs would be provided to children under the nutritious meal scheme.

 At a programme to mark the 105th birth anniversary of late Congress leader Kamaraj, Karunanidhi said healthy children perform well in education and sports. And, one of the ways to become strong is to eat more eggs.

 But if there were eggs, the politics of it didnt take long to break out of the shell. The chief minister trained his guns at the previous ADMK government for taking eggs off the menu.

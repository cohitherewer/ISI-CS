 Life term for killer extortionists 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 11: Five extortionists were sentenced to life in jail today for killing a 24-year-old from Howrah who had raised his voice against them.

 Joy Mukherjee (in picture), a resident of Dharsa in Jagachha and an agent of a private bank, was murdered on the night of October 19, 2005.

 Over 50 residents of Dharsa and its neighbourhood gathered at the fast-track court in Howrah as Amit Koley alias Apa, Kanu Choudhury alias Chotka, Rajib Dutta, Arup Roy and Amit Dhar alias Manu were brought in a police jeep. 

 The crowd started celebrating after magistrate Sandip Roy Choudhury pronounced the verdict.

 Joys father Panchanan, a home guard with Shibpur traffic police, and mother Swapna were also in the court. I feel relieved today that the killers of my only son have been given life imprisonment, Panchanan said.

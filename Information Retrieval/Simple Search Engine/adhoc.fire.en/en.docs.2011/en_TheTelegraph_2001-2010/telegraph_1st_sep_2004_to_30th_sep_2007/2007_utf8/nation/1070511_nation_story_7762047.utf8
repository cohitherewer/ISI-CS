 Surgery, at arms length

 ANANYA SENGUPTA

 Mumbai, May 10: The surgeon on the screen doesnt get within touching distance of the woman as he operates on her heart. Tomorrow, he says, he might not need to be in the same city.

 The H.L. Hiranandani Hospital auditorium isnt showing a sci-fi movie, though.

 The action is taking place live, yards away in the operation theatre. Dr Ganesh Kumar is positioned 5 metres from Anagha Shirodkar, using a prototype robotic arm to clear the blockages in her coronary artery.

 In a test operation the seventh in India, all at the Hiranandani hospital Kumar today used a touch screen and joystick to do in 20 minutes what conventional surgery would have taken hours. An assistant had earlier made the only incision needed a small one at the groin for the guide wire.

 Shirodkar, who had 90 per cent blockage, had trouble breathing and was tired most of the time. She feared the long hours in an operation theatre followed by the painful recovery. As she was being wheeled out of the OT around 1 pm, she grinned at reporters. Im going home in the evening, she said. And she did.

 Coronary angioplasty will not be the same again once the experimental robotic arm is approved, which doctors hope will happen within two years.

 The remote-controlled system will allow patients to be operated on by their preferred surgeons from hundreds of miles away, Kumar, chief interventional cardiologist at the hospital, said.

 The procedure is faster and allows the doctor precision within 0.5 mm, impossible in manual surgery.

 The gains for the surgeon are no less important. No longer must he don an 8-kg lead suit to escape radiation or scrub himself before surgery.

 This will help doctors operate in a relaxed environment, free of X-ray, said Dr Ajay Chaurasia, who took part in the screen demonstration for the media.

 Right number, 

 wrong star

 Mumbai, March 12 (Agencies): Ajay Vasant Giri finally got the number right but he had not bargained for Salman Khan at the other end.

 Giri, a youth addicted to dialling random numbers in the wee hours, has been detained for threatening and abusing Salman after the actor picked up the phone at actress Katrina Kaifs home.

 The 25-year-old Giri got through to Katrinas home by chance but he had no idea that her boyfriend would be there at 4.30 am.

 The Class XII dropout, who lives in suburban Mulund, was picked up after Salman filed a complaint, deputy commissioner of police V.K. Choubey said.

 When Salman answered the call, an argument broke out, during which Giri allegedly abused and threatened the actor.

 Once the complaint was filed, the police tracked down Giri, a businessmans son, and detained him.

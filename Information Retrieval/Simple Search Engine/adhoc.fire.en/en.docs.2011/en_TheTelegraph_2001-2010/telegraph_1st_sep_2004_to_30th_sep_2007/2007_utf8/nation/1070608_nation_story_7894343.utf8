 Loot, scoot amp; shoot

 RAJ KUMAR

 Ranchi, June 7: Morning doesnt always show the day.

 Six armed men looted Rs 1.53 crore from the Syndicate Bank branch here on Hazaribagh Road this morning but, by evening, three of them had been killed by police near the residence of a BJP legislator.

 Soon after the bank opened today, the criminals had trooped in one by one like any other customer. Once inside, they took out their guns and snatched cellphones from people before taking the strongroom key from the acting branch manager Ashok Bando and his assistant P.B. Lakra. 

 The six then entered the strongroom, where they collected all the 100, 500 and 1,000-rupee notes. They left after locking the employees and customers inside the 120sqft strongroom. 

 Reacting swiftly, the city police detained a suspect, whose cellphone revealed the whereabouts of the robbers.

 When the police zeroed in on the house in the Deputy Para area where the criminals had taken shelter, the goons opened fire and hurled bombs. In the ensuing encounter, three of the criminals were shot dead, while one was injured.

 The wounded robber has been admitted to hospital. The remaining two fled.

 The encounter took place in a government flat behind the residence of BJP MLA Chandreshwar Prasad Singh near the district police headquarters. 

 Senior police superintendent M.S. Bhatia said the encounter started at 5.30 pm and lasted about 45 minutes. When the police reached near the government quarter after a tip-off, the criminals opened fire from a house. The police retaliated. When the firing stopped, three criminals were found dead, he said.

 Residents said the house was booked in the name of a sales tax officer, currently posted in Dumka. They claimed that one of the robbers was the officers brother.

 The police said they had recovered the cash looted after the encounter. Officials of the bank were later called to check the amount.

 London, June 4: Having had a huge success with Being Freddie the autobiography of Andrew Flintoff Hodder amp; Stoughton, one of Britains most prestigious publishers, is about to bring out an autobiography of the next great Englishman. 

 Only he wears a blue patka (a mini-turban), has a dark beard and is called Mudhsuden Singh Panesar. 

 In the cricketing world and he made quite an entry in Test cricket in Nagpur in March 2006 by claiming Sachin Tendulkar as his first wicket followed by Mohammad Kaif and Rahul Dravid the left-arm spinner is known simply as Monty.

 His autobiography will be published in October, Hodder amp; Stoughtons sports editor Roddy Bloomfield told The Telegraph. It will be called Montys Turn Im glad you are laughing. 

 Not since Prince Ranji at the end of the 19th century has a cricketer of Indian origin found so secure a niche in the affections of the British people. 

 The book is on its way, said Bloomfield, who intends it to be published in India not only in English, but also in Hindi and Punjabi. We are publishing in October so we can include the two Test series this summer against the West Indies and India.

 Bloomfield, who is thrilled with the sales of Being Freddie sadly, Flintoff looks like being out of action for much of the summer from injury and the need for another operation is convinced that Montys book will also sell well. 

 He is writing it with the help of Richard Hobson, a journalist on the Times, he said. Monty brings an effervescence and charisma to cricket grounds that is almost unbelievable.

 Monty was shortlisted as BBC sports personality of the year but was edged out by Princess Annes horse riding daughter Zara Phillips. 

 He was born in Luton, Bedfordshire, on April 25, 1982, to Sikh parents Paramjeet Singh Panesar and Gursharan Kaur who moved to England from Punjab in 1979. It is estimated that 35 of Montys family members attended the Test against India at Mohali, Punjab, in March 2006. 

 He has a younger brother, Isher Singh Panesar, and sister, Charanjit Kaur Panesar. The family still lives in Luton. 

 Despite some inept fielding or possibly because of it he has become a darling of the crowds. Some fans turn up wearing patkas and fake beards, a sure sign of stardom. 

 Monty, who has a degree in computer science but now plays county cricket for Northamptonshire, is known to be a devout Sikh. 

 I follow Sikhism, and maybe Ive channelled the discipline that religion creates into my cricket, he once said. Theres discipline with any religion, and you can take it into a game or into anything else. 

 Last winter during the Ashes tour of Australia, Phil Dye of the Sydney Morning Herald wrote perceptively about Monty. 

 Commentators at the Perth Test were giggling that he wanted the ball, even though it wasnt his turn to bowl; that even after being hit for 19 runs he was putting his hand up for more. He would bowl every over in the Sydney Test if theyd let him and maybe he should, urged Dye. 

 Bugger the strategy, its the passion we love and Panesar is showing a passion and unbridled joy in the game we havent seen for a long time, continued Dye.

 But what really makes him so popular? A far cry from those fashionable, clean-shaven sports superstars we see so much of these days, he seems the antithesis of fashion. Hes clearly his own man. A devout Sikh, Panesar wears the patka with a dignity that makes the coiffured hairstyles of millionaire sportsmen such as Matt Giteau or David Beckham look silly. Maybe Im getting old, but I just dont get this fixation millionaire sportsmen have with their hair. Give me Panesar and his patka any time.

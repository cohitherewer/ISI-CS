 New Delhi, Feb. 19: Her expression frozen with shock, seven-year-old Muskan is the face of the cross-border tragedy. The tears that have dried on the Rajasthani girls cheeks are for an uncle from Pakistan.

 As her mother Nusrat, 35, tries to calm her down, Muskan once again breaks into sobs. It has been just about 12 hours since the Hussein family, divided by the international border, had hugged Abdul Qayyum a tearful goodbye. 

 Fifty-six-year-old Qayyum, the oldest of four siblings including Nusrat, is one of the seven injured who have suffered the worst burns and are fighting for their lives at Delhis Safdarjung Hospital. 

 The five others at the hospital, authorities say, have a better chance of survival.

 At least eight of the 12 patients here are Pakistanis.

 On the porch outside the burnsdepartment, Nusrats elder sister Hasina speaks on the phone to relations in Rajasthan, her conversation punctuated by sniffles.

 Ever since our parents died 10 years ago, Abdul Bhai has been like a father to us. We cant lose him too, says Javed, the fourth sibling who had arranged for the whole family to come from their western Rajasthan village to see off Qayyum.

 The businessman from Arongi town on Karachis outskirts had been in Delhi since mid-December. He was to leave earlier this month but the train was cancelled because of fog.

 When that train was cancelled, Abdul Bhai had cursed his luck. Imagine what we are going through now, Hasina sobbed.

 The other critical patients are Harish Md, 15, from Karachi; Ramesh, 40, and Ashok Kumar, 21, father and son from Sialkot; Samin, 14, and Nadeem, 10, from Karachi; and Md Zakir, 38, from Uttar Pradesh.

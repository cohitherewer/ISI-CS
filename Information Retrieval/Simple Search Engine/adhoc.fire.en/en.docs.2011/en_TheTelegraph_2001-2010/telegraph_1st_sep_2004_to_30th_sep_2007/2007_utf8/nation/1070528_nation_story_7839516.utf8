 Private quota off the blocks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai/Pune, May 27: Symbiosis International University will not wait for the Supreme Court ruling on the OBC quota to enforce the move from the academic session starting next month.

 The Pune-based institute will be the first private deemed university to implement the reservations on its seven campuses and the 15 institutions it runs in the city. However, the 27 per cent quota will be staggered over three years.

 According to the Symbiosis website, 7 per cent of the seats will be set aside in 2007-08, 13 per cent in 2008-09 and 7 per cent in 2009-10. The roadmap is similar to that recommended by the Veerappa Moily panel for IITs, IIMs and central universities.

 Symbiosis offers postgraduate and undergraduate programmes in management, law, computer science, para-medical studies and mass communication. 

 The 3,367 general-category seats in these courses will not be slashed. Only 7 per cent more seats will be added for the OBCs. This year, 235 OBCs will be admitted. The number will rise to 3,602 over three years, officials said.

 We announced the decision to implement quotas on May 1, but entrance exams to postgraduate courses had already been held on December 17 last year. We have asked the OBC candidates to submit their caste certificates, an official said.

 Symbiosis chancellor S.B. Majumdar was quoted by PTI as saying the 7 per cent reservation this year would not strain resources.

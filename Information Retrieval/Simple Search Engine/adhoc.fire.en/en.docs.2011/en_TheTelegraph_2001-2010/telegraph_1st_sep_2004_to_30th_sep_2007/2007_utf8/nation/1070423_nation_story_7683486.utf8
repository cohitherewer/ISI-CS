 Seize locomotive for unpaid claim

Court officials and lawyers arrived at the Tumkur railway station, 70 km from Bangalore, last week on an unusual mission to attach a locomotive. The action followed the railways failure to pay compensation to families of six accident victims.

 On January 6, 1998, six persons, including three women, had died when a locomotive rammed into an autorickshaw at a level crossing. Last July, the court ordered the railways to pay a compensation of Rs 6 lakh to each victims family, but the payment was never made. 

 An angry court then passed the extraordinary order on attaching railway property. Armed with the order, officials and lawyers arrived at the station, stopped the train and threatened to lift the 4,000 HP diesel locomotive off the tracks to the amusement of a swelling crowd. They allowed the train to leave after the station-master promised to deposit the amount in court. Under the railway act, coaches, wagons and locos cant be attached, but the incident did derail that belief for a while.

 Wild run over pigeons

They are messengers of love and the inspiration behind freedom songs. Now, pigeons are at the heart of a row between two groups of Mumbai residents clawing each other.

 The brawl began when mischief-makers hurled stones at pigeons being fed by residents of a housing society in Navi Mumbais Kharghar last week. The culprits were believed to be from a settlement near the apartment.

 The stone-throwing boys disappeared after residents of the society lodged a police complaint. But they returned later in the night this time in full force. The mob of 350 shanty-dwellers barged into the building, damaged cars and beat up some residents. Two persons were injured in the mayhem. Cases of rioting and arson were registered against the rampaging crowd, but no arrests had been made in this curious case of ruffled feathers.

 Jamia on a new course

 Bravehearts

Missed out on awards being handed out for almost every rhyme and reason this season? Take heart. A Mumbai institute has taken the idea rather seriously patting those who have coped best with heart problems.

 The Asian Heart Institute distributed its Braveheart awards last week. A jury of doctors picked the winners. The Warrior Award motivated patients still fighting their ailments. The Young At Heart Awards were for older individuals who did well in rehabilitation. 

 The Most Negative awards were meant to jolt those who undid their recovery with an unhealthy lifestyle. 

 The Quitter Awards applauded those who stubbed out smoking. The Superman and Superwoman Awards honoured patients who achieved overall progress.

Mumbai: Watch the magic on canvas come alive. Legacy Art Gallery promises all that and more at an exhibition of paintings by various artists till April 30. Timings: 11 am to 7 pm.

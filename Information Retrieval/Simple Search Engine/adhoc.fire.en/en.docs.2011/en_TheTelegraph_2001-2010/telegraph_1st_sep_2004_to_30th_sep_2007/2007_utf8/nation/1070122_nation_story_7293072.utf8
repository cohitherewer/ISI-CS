 Night of nerves for space soldiers

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, Jan. 21: Indian space scientists are about to attempt something they have never done before recover an orbiting space capsule and demonstrate technologies crucial for reusable space planes and manned space missions.

 If all goes according to plan, at 9 am tomorrow, a timer on a space capsule in orbit 625 km above the Atlantic Ocean will trigger a sequence of operations to safely guide the capsule for a splashdown in the Bay of Bengal 46 minutes later.

 The 550-kg space capsule had piggybacked into orbit aboard the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) flight on January 10, which also ferried three other satellites. But unlike all satellites launched by India so far, this space capsule has a return ticket.

 Its a complex mission, much more difficult than launching satellites, G. Madhavan Nair, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), told The Telegraph today. 

 The recovery process will involve slowing down the capsule, orienting it at just the right angle for safe re-entry into the atmosphere during which it will encounter a searing 1,500 degrees Celsius temperature and picking it up after splashdown.

 I think theres that feeling of excitement here that comes with trying something for the first time, said Srirangapatna Shivkumar, director of the Isro Telemetry Tacking and Command Network (Istrac) in Bangalore, from where engineers will track, guide and control the capsule on its journey home.

 On Saturday, while one group of engineers at Istrac kept vigil on the capsule as part of routine housekeeping, another group simulated the recovery sequence on computers. Engineers have already nudged the capsule into a repetitive elliptical orbit that brings the capsule over the same point each day, opening multiple windows for re-entry.

 The recovery sequence, initiated by a timer commanded by Istrac engineers in Bangalore, will begin with the firing of onboard rockets to reduce the capsules speed which is eight km per second while in orbit. This crucial deboost manoeuvre will last nine minutes, after which the engineers will try to orient the capsule for re-entry.

 A blanket of heat-resistant tiles, developed by the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in Thiruvananthapuram, is expected to protect the capsule from the fiery heat that develops as it re-enters the atmosphere. 

 Getting the capsule to enter the atmosphere in just the right angle is crucial for safe re-entry, an Isro scientist said.

 As it descends with reduced speed, the capsule will zoom across the Atlantic Ocean, past the North Pole region and Russia, and approach the Bay of Bengal from the north.

 Istrac engineers, with help from tracking stations elsewhere in the world, will monitor the path of the capsule through the 46 minutes. 

 But there will be a two-minute communication blackout due to the heating between 80 km and 40 km, the scientist said.

 At altitudes of 5 km and 2 km, parachutes will balloon open to slow down the capsule before it hits the water about 140 km south-east of Sriharikota. A Coast Guard vessel will be waiting to fish out the capsule from the waters.

 The capsule recovery experiment will test an array of technologies with applications for reusable space vehicles, manned space missions and remote-operated science experiments in space.

 Without re-entry none of this is possible, the scientist said. But the risks in such a mission range from burn-up to break-up, added another scientist.

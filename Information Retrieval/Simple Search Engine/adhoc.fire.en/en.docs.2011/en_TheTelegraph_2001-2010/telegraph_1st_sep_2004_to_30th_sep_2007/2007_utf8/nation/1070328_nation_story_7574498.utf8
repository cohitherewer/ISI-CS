 Monuments go missing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 27: Thirty-five centrally-protected monuments across the country have disappeared, the government has admitted. 

 The information was placed before Parliament a day after the launch of the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities, which has a five-year, Rs 90-crore mandate to identify and document them before they are lost to posterity.

 But as the official information on the missing monuments shows, much damage has already been done. 

 In her written reply last week to a question in the Rajya Sabha, culture minister Ambika Soni listed 35 centrally-protected monuments/sites, which are not traceable. 

 The figure does not indicate the true scale of the problem, though. Sonis list only mentions the centrally-protected monuments a reference to the sites in the care of the Archaeological Survey of India, which number 3,667 at present.

 It also does not include sites that at some time were protected by state authorities. Currently, there are about 4,000 of them across the country.

 More important, the figure does not take into account the unprotected sites, many of which are not even identified as monuments. The National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities, launched last Monday, is supposed to place such little-known sites on record.

 Most of the 35 untraceable sites, protected by the Centre, were notified during British rule. The ASI was set up in 1861. 

 Soni blamed rapid urbanisation, construction of multi-storeyed residential and commercial buildings, implementation of development projects, etc. for the disappearance of the monuments.

 As many as 12 of the 35 entries some have more than one structure are in Delhi. Uttar Pradesh has eight, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir three each, Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat two each and Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Karnataka one each. 

 Among them is Moti Gate of Sher Shah Suris Delhi, notified as a centrally-protected monument in 1913. There is also no trace of the Alipur cemetery, which apparently fell victim to a bypass on the GT-Karnal Road in the 1980s.

 Law board slams Taslima

 OUR BUREAU

 Hyderabad/Lucknow, Aug. 13: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board today criticised Taslima Nasreen for her writings, saying no Muslim can tolerate blasphemy of Islam.

 Although we welcome criticism, abusive language against Prophet Mohammed is intolerable, the boards assistant general secretary, M.A. Rahim Quraishi, said when asked to comment on Thursdays attack on Taslima in Hyderabad.

 The exiled Bangladeshi writer, whose novel Lajja was banned in her country for hurting Muslim religious feelings, was attending a book release when protesters led by three Majlis-e-Itahadul-Musalmeen MLAs assaulted her with laptops, books and bouquets.

 She should not have been invited, he said. Certain characters in her novels are highly objectionable.

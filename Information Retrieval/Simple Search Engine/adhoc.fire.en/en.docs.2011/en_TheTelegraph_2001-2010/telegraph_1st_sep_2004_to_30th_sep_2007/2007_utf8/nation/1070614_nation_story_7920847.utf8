 Adrift Naidu eyes NTR legacy wave

 The tide is turning in the NTR clan. And hoping to ride the wave of the late leaders legacy is Chandrababu Naidu.

 The Telugu Desam Party boss is keen to bring Balakrishna, NTRs actor-son, on board his unsteady ship. The bait being dangled is a Rajya Sabha nomination.

 One of NTRs daughters, D. Purandareswari, is already a Congress Lok Sabha MP and minister in the UPA government. One of his sons-in-law, D. Venkateswar Rao, is a legislator from Martur in Prakasham.

 In 1995, when he pushed the TDP founders family to the margins, Naidu encouraged Harikrishna, NTRs fourth son, to raise the banner of revolt against his father and stepmother Lakshmi Parvati only to dump him later. A year later, he queered the pitch for Jayakrishna, NTRs eldest son, in the Lok Sabha elections.

 Now, Naidus efforts to project Balakrishna, popularly called Balayya, as the TDP mascot is being seen as little more than a ploy to cash in on his glamour quotient.

 MRCP exams in Chennai

 Life will now be easier for doctors aspiring for the coveted MRCP degree.

 The Royal College of Physicians, which conducts the course, has picked Chennais Sri Ramachandra University as a centre of examination for the clinical test, the first in South Asia.

 The pact between the UK-based institute and the university was inked early this month. 

 Neil Dewhurst, who led the Royal College team to size up the facilities, signed on the dotted line with S. Rangaswami, the universitys vice-chancellor.

 The tests will be held twice a year, in November and March, over three days. About 25,000 doctors take the exam each year.

 Having a centre in Chennai will not only help doctors in India, but also those in neighbouring countries like Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.

 The exam consists of two parts, theory and clinical. The clinical test is meant to gauge communication skills and the ability to offer support to patients and relatives. 

 In the 150-minute test, doctors are evaluated on their approach to patients in various situations. For more information, one can contact T. Nallamuthu at 09444265578. 

 Blaze scars still fresh

 It has been 10 years, but the wounds are still fresh for Sushma Srivastava. 

 Srivastava, who lost her two children in the Uphaar cinema inferno on June 13, 1997, is among the nearly hundred victims families who recently held a 10-day campaign for justice. 

 The protests started on June 4 and culminated with bhajans and a havan on June 13. The families sat outside the Uphaar building from 6 pm to 8 pm each day during the campaign.

 Construction major Ansals are the prime accused in the fire that claimed 59 lives and left hundreds others with permanent scars some physical, others emotional. 

 The Ansals, who built the Green Park theatre, are accused of not having provided adequate exits, leading to a stampede as people tried to escape during the blaze. It doesnt matter if the public has forgotten. I cant forget my loss... nor can I forgive those responsible, said Srivastava.

 Milk menace

 If Mumbaikars get milk that isnt what it is supposed to be, they now have someone to take the blame. The state government has made the food and drug administration (FDA) commissioner responsible for adulteration. 

 Deputy chief minister R.R. Patil took the decision last week. Many who took part in the discussions were of the view that some food inspectors need to be transferred.

 The dairy development department, police and the FDA will do all they can to check the menace, Patil said, but made it clear the buck will have to stop at the commissioner. Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has already called for tougher laws to put a lid on the problem.

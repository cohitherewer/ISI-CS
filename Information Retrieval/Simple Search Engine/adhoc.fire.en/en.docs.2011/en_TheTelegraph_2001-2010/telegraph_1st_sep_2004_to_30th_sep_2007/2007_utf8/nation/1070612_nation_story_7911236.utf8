 SC lash for rash drivers

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES

 New Delhi, June 11: The capitals traffic violators today got a lashing from the Supreme Court which declined to stay heavy penalties that Delhi High Court had imposed on them.

 What is your right? Do you have a right to break the law? a bench headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat asked the Federation of Delhi Bus Operators, which had filed a special leave petition challenging the penalties slapped by the high court.

 On March 26, a high court division bench, taking a grim view of cases of reckless driving by bus operators, increased traffic violation fines by Rs 500. He (the driver) shall be liable to pay Rs 500 for each offence committed by him in addition to the complaint fee payable, the high court said. 

 But Harvinder Singh Kalra, the bus federations president, challenged the order in the apex court.

 The federations senior counsel, Mukul Rohatgi, argued that the directive amounted to legislating the Motor Vehicles Act which is very much within the domain of Parliament. 

 The counsel said the courts only had the power of interpreting the law, not frame laws or pass orders that were contrary to the statutory provision.

 The authorities could collect only the fine prescribed under the act and nothing beyond it, the counsel said. Any such excess amount should be collected through amendment of the act. But the apex court bench hit back, saying: Then dont break the law. Why do you want to break the law? 

 Later, though, it issued notices to the Centre, the Delhi government and other city authorities seeking their response to the petition.

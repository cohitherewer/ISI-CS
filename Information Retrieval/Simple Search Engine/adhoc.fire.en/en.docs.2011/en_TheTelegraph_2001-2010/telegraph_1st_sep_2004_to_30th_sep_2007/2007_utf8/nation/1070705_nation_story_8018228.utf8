 Mamata keeps NDA guessing

 Mamata: Too tied up

 New Delhi, July 4: Mamata Banerjee rebuffed the NDA-BJPs overtures for a meeting during the three days she was here this week. 

 NDA convener George Fernandes called the Trinamul Congress chief a couple of times, asking if he could see her or she could drop in. But he was told Mamata was too tied up with protest meetings over the Nandigram-Singur issues and did not wish to get distracted by anything else (read the presidential poll). 

 Mamata was in touch with Fernandes till the NDA hadnt finalised its nominee. She had rooted for A.P.J. Abdul Kalam but once the BJP said no, she virtually switched off.

 Sushma Swaraj, the NDAs spokesperson for the presidential poll, found it hard to explain why Mamata or anyone from her party hadnt signed Bhairon Singh Shekhawats papers. Dinesh Trivedi (Trinamuls Rajya Sabha MP) arrived late, is all she could say. 

 The BJP wasnt part of the protests the Trinamul chief held in Delhi over the past few days, though the Janata Dal (United), Janata Dal (Secular) and the Samajwadi Party were invited.

 BJP leaders, however, believe the perceived Left-Congress proximity evident in the way they decided on Pratibha Patil would keep Mamata in the NDA, sources said.

 But Congress sources said the Trinamul leader had begun positioning herself for the 2009 elections. Whether Mamata supports Pratibha or not is not as relevant a factor as preparing the ground for a long-term relationship, they added. Small deals dont help cement a long-term relationship, a Congress source said.

 Some in Trinamul have similar views. If we (the Congress and Trinamul) can come together, as we did in the Panskura local body election, we are more than a match for the Left on its turf, said a source close to Mamata.

 Trinamul believes the Congress has a larger base in Bengal than the BJP and it makes better sense to tie up with the former for the Lok Sabha elections in 2009.

 If, after the polls, Trinamul has to choose between a Congress and a BJP-led coalition, Mamata will be in a better position to take a call. But, for now, party sources say, Mamata will do nothing drastic to upset her equation with the BJP nor will she stop speaking to her old friends in the Congress, Trinamul sources said. 

 The Prime Ministers sympathetic attitude in his meeting with the relatives of the Singur and Nandigram victims yesterday, under Mamatas leadership, is seen as yet another sign of the warming Trinamul-Congress ties.

 Eye on Mulayam turf

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Bhartana (Etawah), April 4: When Rahul Gandhi addressed meetings in Jhansi, Mehrauni and Gursarai, there was a reason: the Congress had either won these seats in the last elections or finished second, and his presence could give the candidate just the push needed to touch the winning post.

 But why did he stop to speak in Bhartana when time was scarce? Bhartana, which the Congress had wrested from Samajwadi Party in 2002, is where Mulayam Singh Yadav will contest from on April 7 in an election whose result is known. His brother Shivpal Singh Yadav seen as the de facto chief minister is fighting next door in Jaswant Nagar. 

 We wanted to prove that Rahul is serious about his politics and has the courage and resolve to take on Mulayam on his turf, said state Congress vice-president Satyadeo Tripathi.

 When the Congress tried to hoist its tricolour and paste Rahuls posters on its own office in the town 20 km from Etawah, these were pulled down by the Samajwadis. Yet, the party managed to pack the medium-sized ground of Gopinath Dixit rice mill with its supporters, mostly from the upper castes. 

 Srinath Yadav, who described himself as a habitual meeting-hopper, came to see and hear Rahul but made it clear he would vote for Mulayam. 

 Next to him was a former army captain, P.S. Yadav. I am over 60 and belong to a family of freedom-fighters for whom the association with the Nehru-Gandhi family is almost sacred, he said, adding he was an exception among Yadavs.

 Rahul, however, did not speak of his familys past. His speech was about the here and now, and the golden future. If you want change, you have to think and work differently. The youths have a responsibility to restore to Uttar Pradesh the glory and prestige it once had. The future is yours and nobody elses.

 20-year dispute over Bachchan plot

 Bachchan: Messy deal

 Lucknow, June 2: The land registered in Amitabh Bachchans name to prove him a farmer was already at the centre of an inter-district dispute.

 Plot No. 702 in Daulatpur village, with some other areas near the border between Barabanki and Sitapur, has been claimed by both districts since the early 1980s, said a land registration clerk in Daulatpur, Putan Singh. The dispute is pending in the Land Revenue Board.

 The Barabanki officials had used this messy status of the land to manipulate records and allot it to Amitabh, suggested a source in the state revenue department, which has received a probe report from the new Barabanki district magistrate, Leena Johri.

 Its easier to give away a plot that is tangled in a long-standing dispute than one whose ownership is clear.

 Records in Barabankis Fatehpur tehsil showed the land as parti (land for village welfare) till a letter arrived from the Maval subdivisional officer (SDO), Pune, on March 24 last year. The letter asked whether Amitabh and son Abhishek were indeed farmers, as they had claimed to be in order to retain a 24-acre plot in Lonavla, Pune.

 From March 26, the Barabanki records show the land registered in Amitabhs name, the officials said.

 Yet, records in Sitapurs Mehmudabad tehsil show five farmers Jarnail Singh, Salwant Singh, Jaswant Singh, Sucha Singh and M.N. Singh as the owners of the plot. They have been tilling the plot for decades.

 Legally, we call it an overlapping of revenue records, said former revenue minister Ambika Chaudhary.

 Johris report, submitted on May 28, recommends action against eight officials at the block land registration office. Among them is the then Fatehpur SDO, Ajay Kumar Shrivastava, accused of signing backdated documents to prove Amitabhs claim.

 Johri said: All I can say is I have sent a report to the state revenue department and an attempt has been made in the report to fix accountability for the irregular actions.

 The report cites a letter dated April 12, 2006, by Mahendra Singh, subdivisional magistrate (SDM) of Barabanki tehsil, who challenged Shrivastavas action. 

 The Fatehpur SDO is answerable to the Barabanki SDM.

 Shrivastava pleaded he was forced to sign the backdated documents by then DM Ramashankar Sahu, who later issued the farmer certificate to the Bachchans, the revenue department source said.

 When Singh contacted Sahu, the DM allegedly said he had merely followed orders from above and that if he had refused to sign, he might have risked his job.

 Johris report, however, wants Singh probed as well. He, too, had signed the documents on April 11, 2006.

 Singh told The Telegraph from Rae Bareli, where he is the SDM now, that though he had signed the certificates, he had not put his office stamp to prove my innocence.

 Sahu, now Kushinagar DM, denied he had forced any official to sign papers.

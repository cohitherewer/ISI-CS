 Mulayam in assets plea

 New Delhi, March 28: Mulayam Singh Yadav today filed a petition seeking review of the March 1 Supreme Court order directing the CBI to probe allegations that his family had amassed huge assets through corrupt means, says our legal correspondent. 

 The Uttar Pradesh chief ministers son, Akhilesh Yadav, had earlier filed a review petition, which came up for hearing before a bench headed by Justice C.K. Thakker today. The hearing remained inconclusive at the end of the day. 

 Among other things, the Yadav family has requested the court to stay the investigation till the Assembly elections are over. 

 The chief justice had referred the matter to Justice Thakker after Justice A.R. Lakshmanan, who has now retired, refused to hear the case.

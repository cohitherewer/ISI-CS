NATION BRIEFS

 Srinagar, Aug. 2: Villagers in Waripora thrashed two pistol-bearing youths intending to kill a tailor, a month after two army jawans were paraded semi-naked in Bandipore for molesting a girl. 

 Police said the two were Lashkar-e-Toiba militants but locals suspected they were working for the security forces. Muzaffar Ahmad Lone and Shamim Mir visited Nazir Wanis house at Waripora, Baramulla district, on Wednesday and wanted to speak to him alone. But Nazirs family resisted. The neighbours came to their aid and thrashed the two. They were later handed over to the police. 

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has said a person can be convicted on the basis of a dying declaration only if it is consistent, voluntary and truthful. The same must be held to have been rendered voluntarily and truthfully, it said, quashing the life term imposed on a man charged with killing his wife.

 New Delhi: The Centre has said salaries of Supreme Court employees will also be fixed by the sixth Central Pay Commission set up to review the wages of government employees.

 New Delhi (PTI): A court has issued a production warrant against Abu Salem because Mumbai police had failed to produce him before it in an extortion case. Salem has to be produced in court on August 21. 

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has issued notices to the Centre, the state government and a playschool for asking the parents of a boy suffering from anorectal disorder to withdraw him because he was attending classes with a catheter attached. 

 Jammu (PTI): A jawan was found dead under mysterious circumstances on Thursday in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir. Sepoy Balbir Singh had come on leave from Assam last week and was staying with his family.

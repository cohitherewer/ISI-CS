 Mulayam flock kicks up furore in House

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 2: Stung by the Supreme Courts directive that the CBI should probe Mulayam Singh Yadavs assets, his party kicked up a ruckus in Parliament today.

 Around noon, the Lok Sabha was forced to adjourn for the day and Rajya Sabha, too, faced repeated adjournments.

 As soon as proceedings began, Samajwadi Party members walked into the well of the House chanting slogans like Sonia ki tanashahi, nahi chalegi (down with Sonia Gandhis dictatorship) and Congress ki jhoothi saazish nahin chalegi(down with the Congress conspiracy).

 Not to be left behind, Congressmen retaliated: Isteefa do (resign). They demanded Mulayam should step down as Uttar Pradesh chief minister after the apex court yesterday asked the CBI to probe allegations that he and his family owned assets disproportionate to their income.

 The Samajwadis then demanded that question hour be suspended to allow the House to discuss what was a Congress conspiracy to use the CBI for political purposes. The CBI, they alleged, was the Congress bureau of investigation.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said the government had nothing to do with the development. The court had acted on a public interest litigation against Mulayam. 

 In the Rajya Sabha, Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh led the charge, brandishing a CD that his party claimed had proof of Congress machinations.

 After days of putting up with disruptions over the Quattrocchi affair, Speaker Somnath Chatterjee made his displeasure clear.

 While seeking the consent of the House for cancelling a scheduled sitting on Monday for Holi, Chatterjee said he was a reluctant partner in the decision. 

 When members wished him Holi mubarak, he said there would be a point in that greeting if Parliament had remained open.

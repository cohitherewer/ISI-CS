 In bed, an Indian revolution

 Survey sizzler

 New Delhi, Sept. 25 (PTI): Urban Indians have one of the most exciting sex lives in the world and are also the most open when it comes to talking to partners about sex, says a new global survey.

 Almost three-quarters (74 per cent) of Indians surveyed are comfortable with telling their partners what they like in bed, way above the global average of 58 per cent and just 49 per cent in the UK, says the Durex Sexual Wellbeing Global Survey.

 The survey further says that two-thirds of Indians (68 per cent) think their love lives are exciting, a sharp contrast to 38 per cent for English lovers and 36 per cent for French lovers. Moreover, 63 per cent of Indians say they have enough variety, compared with 47 per cent in the UK and a low 9 per cent in Japan.

 Only Greeks (76 per cent) and Mexicans (80 per cent) have a more exciting sex life than Indians.

 The survey covered more than 26,000 people online across 26 countries. The respondents talked about every aspect of their sex lives.

 Indian bedrooms are the scenes of a range of antics for some, with sensual massage (55 per cent), sexual fantasies (58 per cent) and looking at erotic materials (55 per cent) at the top of the menu. More than a third of Indians also love to include role play (37 per cent) and wearing sexy underwear (34 per cent), the survey says.

 The survey results also point to Indians increasingly becoming open to using sex toys to spice up their sex lives.

 Almost six in ten (57 per cent) Indians think it is acceptable for products aimed at improving sex lives to be available in mainstream stores. Currently, just 9 per cent of Indians use vibrators compared to 21 per cent globally although 13 per cent of Indians are interested to have a try, the survey says.

 According to the study, 33 per cent Indians use lubricants to make sex more enjoyable. The global figure is 34 per cent.

 Compared with other nations, Indians seem a little reluctant to experiment. While 22 per cent would like to try massage oils, only 9 per cent are interested in an orgasm-enhancing gel and just 7 per cent would consider aphrodisiacs.

 However, 57 per cent Indians believe that people will become more experimental in their sex lives over the next decade, boosted by information available on the Internet.

 Fidelity is still something that Indians are proud of, the survey shows. Indian men have averaged six lovers and women have averaged two, while in the UK the figures are 16 and 10, respectively. Globally, men, on an average, have 13 partners and women seven.

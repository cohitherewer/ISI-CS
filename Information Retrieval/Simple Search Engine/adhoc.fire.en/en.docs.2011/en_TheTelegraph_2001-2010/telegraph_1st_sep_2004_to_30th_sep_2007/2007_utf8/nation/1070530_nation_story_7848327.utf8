 Breather for BMW Nanda

 New Delhi, May 29 (PTI): In a setback to the prosecution in the BMW hit-and-run case, a key witness today told a trial court that it was not prime accused Sanjeev Nanda who was driving the car that mowed down six persons in 1999.

 It was a healthy and hefty man that emerged out of the driving seat of the car just after the accident and he is not present in the court right now, Kulkarni, a Mumbai-based trader, told additional sessions judge Vinod Kumar during his cross-examination by the prosecution.

 As against the prosecution theory that claimed Nanda, the grandson of former naval chief S.M. Nanda, was at the wheel when the accident took place, he said the alleged drivers physical features did not match either of the accused present in the courtroom.

 Kulkarni, however, admitted Nanda was one of the occupants who alighted from the car just after the incident.

 He reiterated that it was sheer Delhi police pressure that had forced him to name Nanda in his earlier statement.

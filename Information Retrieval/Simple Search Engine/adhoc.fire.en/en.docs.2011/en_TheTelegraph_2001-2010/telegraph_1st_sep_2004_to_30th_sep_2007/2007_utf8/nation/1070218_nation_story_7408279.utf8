 Law to watch foreign funds

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: The government is thinking of a law to check the inflow of suspect foreign investment that can threaten the countrys security.

 The move comes in the wake of national security adviser M.K. Narayanans comment in Munich last week that terrorist outfits were using the Mumbai and Chennai stock exchanges to play the market.

 Sources said inter-ministerial discussions by the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), which had suggested an umbrella legislation titled National Security Exception Act for keeping an eye on future foreign participation as well as past investments, has been put on the fast track. 

 The first draft of the proposed act is being circulated among key ministries, a source said.

 In a note to the government, the NSCS has cited examples like Americas Exon-Florio Amendment and the UKs Golden Share or Protection of Trading Interests Act.

 The Exon-Florio Amendment has been implemented by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, an inter-agency panel chaired by the treasury secretary and which includes members from the departments of defence, justice, commerce and homeland security.

 The amendment provides for a mechanism to review and if the President thinks it necessary to restrict foreign direct investment that threatens Americas security.

 The Golden Share provisions, applied by the Thatcher administration, gave the UK government powers to prevent takeovers it felt were against public interest and guarantee the place of government-appointed directors on company boards.

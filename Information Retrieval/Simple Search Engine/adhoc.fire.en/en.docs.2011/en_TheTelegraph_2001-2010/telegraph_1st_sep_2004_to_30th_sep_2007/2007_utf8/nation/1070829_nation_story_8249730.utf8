 Wife swap

 New Delhi, Aug. 28 (PTI): Suresh Chand would have got a new wife in Delhi High Court, thanks to the capitals cops.

 The faux pas came to light after the counsel for Chand told the bench that the woman produced by the police was not the petitioners wife.

 The woman, too, said she was married to Suresh Kumar, not Suresh Chand.

 Realising the police had confused between the first names of the two petitioners, the bench let the cops go with a smile.

 The woman was supposed to be produced in court in connection with a matrimonial dispute filed by Suresh Kumar. But the police by mistake filed the status report of Suresh Kumars case with the habeas corpus petition filed by Suresh Chand.

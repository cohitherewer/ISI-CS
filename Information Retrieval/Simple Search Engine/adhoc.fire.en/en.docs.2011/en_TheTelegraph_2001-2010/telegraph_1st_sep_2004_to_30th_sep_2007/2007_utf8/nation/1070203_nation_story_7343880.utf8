 Srinagar, Feb. 2: A day after the body of Abdul Rahman Padder was exhumed from a Sumbal graveyard, one more victim tumbled out of the polices cupboard today.

 Nazir Ahmad Deka from the remote Daksum village in Anantnag was allegedly killed by Ganderbal police and passed off as a Lashkar militant.

 The same police team is believed to be behind the killing of Padder, a carpenter from Larnoo village in Anantnag. 

 Two more bodies are likely to be exhumed tomorrow, one at Ajas village and another at Kangan.

 Dekas presumed grave at Saloora village in Ganderbal described him as Lashkar militant Molvi Nazir. But his wife Tasleema Begum, taken to the spot by the police, identified him as her missing husband. 

 Deka, the father of three who used to sell perfume in Srinagars Lal Chowk area, had gone missing on February 16 last year. The police had lodged an FIR four months later.

 We have taken his blood and tissue samples for DNA testing, said DIG, central Kashmir, Farooq Ahmad, who heads the official investigation and supervised the exhumation. His wife has identified him.

 The family of Deka has told the police about the involvement of a police constable, Nazir Ahmad Sheikh, in his disappearance and murder.

 The family told us he was seeking money from them to reveal his whereabouts after he disappeared, a police officer, involved in the investigations, said. The family says they even paid him a few thousand rupees.

 Over the last 11 months, the family has been trying to trace his whereabouts. It was during the interrogation of the two policemen arrested in the Padder case that the investigation team learnt Deka had been killed and buried at Saloora village.

 For the second day, massive anti-government protests rocked the exhumation site. The police had to use smoke shells and fire in the air to disperse the mob. 

 Thousands had assembled at Saloora to witness the exhumation of Deka. They later chanted strong anti-government and pro-freedom slogans to give vent to their anger.

 Cops killed

 Militants killed four policemen and injured three after opening fire at a checking party at Rakh Latter Watchi in Pulwama this evening.

 Those killed have been identified as head constable Ishtaq Ahmad, constable Mohammed Azam and driver Noor Mohammad. One body is yet to be identified, a police spokesman said.

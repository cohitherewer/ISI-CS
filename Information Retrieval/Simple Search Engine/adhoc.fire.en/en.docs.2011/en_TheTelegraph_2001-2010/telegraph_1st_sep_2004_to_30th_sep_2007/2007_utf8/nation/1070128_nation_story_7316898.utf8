 Kidney probe

 Chennai: 

 Police have sent out summons to 57 hospitals authorised 

 to conduct organ transplants across the state as part of 

 their probe into the kidney-sale racket involving tsunami-hit 

 fisherfolk from Tiruvallur district, reports our special 

 correspondent.

 The list includes some leading corporate hospitals which have been permitted to perform organ transplants.

 The state crime branch investigating the case has sent a questionnaire to the 57 hospitals to get details from their records regarding the number of kidney transplants performed in the past six years and details of the donors and the recipients.

 This would help ascertain how 

 many people had donated voluntarily as required under law, 

 the profile of the donors (whether they are near relatives 

 or friends/outsiders), the authenticity of the donors and 

 whether the donation was done for monetary gain, police 

 sources said.

 CPM discovers virtue in CBI

New Delhi, March 16: The CPM had once nicknamed the Central Bureau of Investigation the Congress Bureau of Investigation. Now, it is ready to swear by its findings.

 Let the CBI bring the real facts to the surface, said Sitaram Yechury, the partys politburo member, fending off virtually every question put to him on the Nandigram bloodbath.

 So what has changed about the CBI? A lot, actually, but most important, it is now under a government the Left supports. 

 The CPM is confident the inquiry will bring out what it already believes that Wednesdays violence in Nandigram was the result of a political plot to destabilise the Bengal government. It had nothing to do with land. 

 Wait for the CBI report to come out. We were ready for a judicial inquiry. But the high court has already ordered a CBI inquiry, Yechury said. The National Alliance for Peoples Movements, which represents grassroots organisations, has demanded a judicial, not a CBI, probe. 

 Not long back, trust was something the CPM wasnt ready to place in the CBI. 

 On several occasions, mostly outside Parliament, the party questioned the fairness of its investigations. This was an organisation that could be manipulated by the ruling party or coalition, it said.

 The Left opposed a CBI investigation into the Bofors deal on fears that the agency could be influenced by the Narasimha Rao government. Last year, when the agency defreezed Ottavio Quattrocchis UK accounts, the communists cast doubts on the honesty of the UPA regime. They wanted to know who in the government issued the order.

 The CPM repeatedly accused the NDA government of using the agency to target RJD boss Lalu Prasad over his alleged role in the fodder scam. 

 The BJP-led coalition was also accused of manipulating the CBI to harass former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati and Ajit Jogi, former Congress chief minister of Chhattisgarh. Both had been facing allegations of corruption.

 The CBI, the CPM has believed for years, is an investigative agency thats not autonomous despite all claims to the contrary by the ruling party at the Centre. 

 That was then. Now, in a leap of faith, the party hopes the agency will unearth the plot of the Trinamul and the Naxalites to challenge the Left Front government.

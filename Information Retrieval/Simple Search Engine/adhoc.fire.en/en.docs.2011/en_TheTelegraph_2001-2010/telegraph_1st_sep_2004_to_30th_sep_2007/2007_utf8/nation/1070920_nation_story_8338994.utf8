 Advani cloud on BJP meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The BJP fears the leadership issue will overshadow more crucial matters at its Bhopal national executive starting on Friday.

 Party leaders said there was no question of changing Rajnath Singh as national president at the moment but were apprehensive that L.K. Advani might be projected as the Prime Minister candidate for the next elections.

 Advani is not seen as the natural candidate for the post since the Jinnah fiasco in Pakistan. Some senior leaders have been vocal about their opposition to him.

 The Rajnath camp has been taking pains to explain that the leadership issue is not on the Bhopal agenda and that no decision has been taken on Advani.

 The BJP chiefs loyalists rubbished reports that the RSS had agreed on Advani at its recent Mumbai meet. They said it had, instead, expressed reservations about faction fights being conducted through the media.

 It is a bad ploy to project Advanis leadership before the party has decided on this. We know it is being done to discredit Rajnath Singh. We are sure Advani will not appreciate it as it will damage his prospects, a Rajnath sympathiser said.

 The Bhopal meet is expected to focus on the incompatibility of the Congress and its Left allies following the nuclear stand-off. The governments alleged pro-Muslim bias could also find mention in the political resolution. A separate resolution is likely on the Ram setu controversy.

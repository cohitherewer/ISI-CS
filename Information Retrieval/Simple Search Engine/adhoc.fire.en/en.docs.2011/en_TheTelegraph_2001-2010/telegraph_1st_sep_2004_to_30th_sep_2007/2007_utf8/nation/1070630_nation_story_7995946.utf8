 Caste cloud on AIIMS job test

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 A grab of The Telegraph report on allegations of discrimination at AIIMS which appeared on July 5, 2006

 New Delhi, June 29: Reserved category doctors applying for jobs at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences have alleged they were deliberately failed in the entrance exams, adding to a growing list of allegations of discrimination the institute faces. 

 Coming less than two months after a Prime Minister-appointed committee reported rampant caste abuse in the premier medical college, the new allegation is likely to further fuel tension on campus. 

 The AIIMS administration has set up a committee to look into the allegation but has said that irrespective of the committees findings, the results for the job entrances this year will stay as they are. 

 At the centre of the storm is a new selection process initiated this year for the job of senior resident doctors. 

 Postgraduates applying for the job had to appear for a written examination and a departmental assessment both with 50 per cent weightage in the final result in previous years. This year, though, the departmental assessment was transformed into a separate layer of the screening which students who cleared the written test had to sit for. 

 A minimum qualification mark of 50 per cent was set for the departmental assessment a viva conducted by the AIIMS faculty. 

 SC/ST postgraduate students, fearing that the subjective assessment would be used to deny them jobs, had written to the administration when the new process was announced a copy of the letter received by the administration is with The Telegraph. 

 The June 20 written examinations for 107 posts this year were cleared by 84 students belonging to SC or ST categories. Only 24 of them managed to clear the 50 per cent qualification in the viva that followed. 

 Our fears that the viva following the written test would be used to deny us seats have been vindicated, claimed Dr Abhijeet, one of those who failed to clear the viva. 

 Some like Dr Nand Kishore have done exceedingly well during their MBBS and MD at AIIMS, never failing, their marksheets show. Nand Kishore cleared his MD exams just a month back including a departmental assessment by four professors of which two were external examiners. 

 Am I so incompetent that I cleared the same departmental examination with external examiners, but failed a month later with AIIMS professors? I feel cheated, he said. 

 AIIMS dean (examinations) T.D. Dogra has set up a committee under Dr C.S. Pandav, head of AIIMSs community medicine department. 

 The committee will, however, only examine such allegations in the future, he said.

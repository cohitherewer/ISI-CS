 Hyderabad, May 18: Sheikh Hussain had raised his tiny hands to seek Allahs blessings when the blow came.

 The six-year-old, who is on summer vacation, had gone to Mecca Masjid with uncle Syed Naseeruddin to attend Friday prayers.

 I saw the bomb explode and showed it to my uncle. He was hit moments later. I, too, was hurt in the stampede that followed, Hussain said.

 Naseeruddin, a 45-year-old fruit vendor near Charminar, said he had not sought this kind of a dua (blessing). I was hit on my head by a flying rock and some other objects. Before I could recover, I received another blow on my back.

 Naseeruddins wife Nafisa Begum, 40, fears her husband might not be able to walk for another six months. Why do the poor and weak Muslims have to suffer? she asked. 

 With five mouths to feed, Nafisa plans to ferry fruits from tomorrow.

 The blast fractured his arm and a flying rock struck the back of his head, but Sultans faith hasnt been shaken. He wants to attend a congregation of Islamic clerics tomorrow. But I doubt whether it will be held at all, the 21-year-old said from his Osmania Government Hospital bed.

 But not all Muslims in the city can afford to be so calm. Groups of youths huddle in the lanes and bylanes of the old city, their blood boiling in anger.

 People are still on the streets. They are angry and asking why Mecca Masjid was targeted, said H.A. Shafi, the personal assistant to the Speaker of the Andhra Pradesh Assembly. His house is just behind the mosque.

 Some youths stopped politicians from calling on the injured at the Osmania and NIMS hospitals. Muslim leaders of the Telugu Desam Party and the Telengana Rashtra Samiti were pushed away. They also vented their fury at Majlis-e-Itahadul-Musalmeen (MIM) legislator Mumtaz Khan. 

 A group stopped state minister Fareeduddin for a while, but later allowed him to go in.

 The MIM has called a bandh tomorrow. The partys president and Charminar MP, Assaduddin Owaisi, had blamed the blast on government apathy towards minorities and the failure of police intelligence. 

 It is time the police stop suspecting every Muslim and take precautionary measures to contain the growing unrest and violence in the society at large, he said.

 Buses went off the roads today after nearly 20 were damaged by mobs in the blast backlash. The police cordoned off the old city area.

 Shafi said Isha prayers the fifth and last of the day had been concluded at Mecca Masjid. The worshippers are worried that some relics of Prophet Mohammed kept in the mosque, including his hair, might have been damaged.

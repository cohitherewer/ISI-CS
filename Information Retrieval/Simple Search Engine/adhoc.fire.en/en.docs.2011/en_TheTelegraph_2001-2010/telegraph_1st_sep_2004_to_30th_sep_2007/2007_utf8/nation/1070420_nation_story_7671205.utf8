 Katara trafficking go-between in the dock

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, April 19: Kapurthala police have registered a case against Joginder Singh, the person accused of striking the deal with BJP MP Babubhai Katara to take Paramjeet Kaur to Toronto on his wifes passport.

 Joginder is absconding, but he had admitted to local reporters that he introduced Paramjeet to Katara and he was above board in the entire controversy.

 We have registered a case on the complaint of Paramjeets parents against Joginder as the agent who had promised to unite her with her husband, said Rajiv Agarwal, senior superintendent of police, Kapurthala.

 Joginder told me he can take my daughter out of the country if we could manage Rs 30 lakh. Had I known that Paramjeet would be accompanying an MP on his wifes passport I would have expressed my reservations, her father said over the phone.

 The police said Paramjeets mother-in-law has claimed Katara was paid Rs 3 lakh as advance for taking her to Toronto where her husband, Paramjit Singh Sodhi, lives. Sodhi, too, had illegally migrated to Canada some years ago.

 Since she had failed to go to Canada legally after her wedding, Paramjits parents and in-laws decided to get in touch with travel agents. The money was arranged with help from two of her brothers settled in Italy, an officer said.

 Family sources said Rs 10 lakh was arranged for the travel agent in India, and the rest Rs 17 lakh was to be paid to Katara in foreign currency.

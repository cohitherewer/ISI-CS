 Market roof crashes, dozens trapped

 Chandigarh, June 10: A concrete shed collapsed at Chandigarhs biggest vegetable and grain market this afternoon, killing at least two persons and trapping up to 50, of whom 13 had been rescued.

 Dozens had a narrow escape, though, as the 150-foot-long roof crumbled slowly. It did not fall all at once but in parts, said Baljit, who watched the horror unfold from his shop across the street in Sector 26.

 Had it happened in the morning or late evening instead of around 4.30 pm, the toll would have been higher, he said. There werent too many customers. Most were shopkeepers. Some bidding was going on between wholesale suppliers and sellers, while some others were taking their afternoon nap.

 The official figures counted only the two bodies pulled out of the rubble till late at night, but shopkeepers and local people claimed there were six dead.

 I first thought a shops shutter was being rolled down. Then it seemed a number of shutters were being rolled down together, said Mukesh, a customer, his head swathed in a blood-soaked bandage.

 Before I realised what was happening, a big chunk of concrete grazed my head. Had I been standing a few inches to the right or left, I would have been trapped.

 Accounts of how many were trapped swung wildly between 50 and 100 in the first few hours, but by night at least 13 had been rescued. It wasnt clear how many more still lay under the rubble.

 The initial estimate was too high because of panic. As people are being rescued, the number is believed to be far lower, home secretary Krishan Mohan said.

 The army led the operation, overseen by the Western Commands chief engineer, Major General Gautam Banerjee, whose team had rescued a five-year-old boy, Prince, from a 60-foot bore-well in Kurukshetra last year.

 A man who stuck a hand out of the debris and screamed for help was among the first to be pulled out alive. People were running helter-skelter during the staggered collapse and many may have run towards portions that were crumbling, Mukesh said.

 The shopkeepers alleged the administration had ignored requests to repair the shed. We had sent several applications. The roof had developed cracks, said market committee member Tony Sethi.

 Another member, Mohan Chaudhary, said almost all the structures in the 30-year-old market might crumble if repairs were not done. We do business under constant fear, he said. I shall sit outside on the road now. 

 Baljit said: I heard a noise, came out and saw a cloud of dust. It seems more mud than cement was used to build the shed.

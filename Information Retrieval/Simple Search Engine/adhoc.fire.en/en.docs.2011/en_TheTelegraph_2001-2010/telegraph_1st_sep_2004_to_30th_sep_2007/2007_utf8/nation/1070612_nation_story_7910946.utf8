Leeds, June 11: A team of Indian directors, producers and financiers, including Ramesh Sippy, Mukesh Bhatt and Manmohan Shetty of Adlabs, last week visited Harewood House, one of Yorkshires best-known stately homes.

 The homes owner, Viscount Lascelles, showed them round the grounds of the sprawling estate and encouraged his influential guests to consider shooting one of their films in his county. 

 The meeting was organised by Screen Yorkshire an agency which encourages the economic development of Englands largest county through film production and which is taking advantage of the presence of the many biggies of Bollywood who have arrived for this years IIFA. 

 Bhatt is an important catch for Yorkshire: he has already decided to shoot a film called Jannat in the county. I am 100 per cent for Yorkshire, he said. My son (Vishesh) is here, the director is here, the scriptwriter is here. Jannat means heaven. 

 After Lascelles had given his Indian guests a tour of his home and gardens and the lush grounds sloping down to a lake whose waters sparkled in early summer sunshine, Bhatt was gracious enough to acknowledge with a sweep of his hand: This is heaven.

 Lascelles knows all about the film business because apart from running a tourist business that pays for the upkeep of Harewood House we get 250,000 visitors a year he is a television producer of note (having once done a series called Inspector Morse). 

 Despite serious exchanges between the Indians and a reasonably heavyweight Yorkshire side, some difficult issues will have to be resolved before Bollywood moves into Yorkshire in a significant way.

 What Bollywood wants is for Yorkshire to somehow fund an Indian film or at least foot a sizeable chunk of the budget. In return, it promises a tourism spin-off, rather as Lord of the Rings did for New Zealand. 

 Lascelles wanted a financially driven co-production or partnership there should be something for both sides. 

 I dont rule out the tourism argument but I am slightly sceptical about it, he told The Telegraph. But I would love a Bollywood film to be shot at Harewood. 

 Lascelles did not know Sippy was the man who had made Sholay, nor was Sippy too keen to brag about one of the most successful Indian films of all time Ive been talking about Sholay for 30 years and I now want to talk about something else. 

 But Sippy was cautiously optimistic about the prospects for collaboration with Yorkshire, especially after breathing in the breathtaking beauty of Harewood House.

 It is important to take our relationship to the next level, he said.

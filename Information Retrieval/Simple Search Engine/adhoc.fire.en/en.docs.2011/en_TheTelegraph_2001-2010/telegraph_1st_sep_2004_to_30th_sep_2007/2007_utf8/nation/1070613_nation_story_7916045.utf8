 BSF rings border alert 

 MUZAFFAR RAINA 

 Srinagar, June 12: The BSF has warned that Pakistan is fortifying the border near Jammu even as Delhi and Islamabad talk of confidence building measures in a climate of ceasefire.

 Pakistan has so far constructed 70 bunkers and 55 observatory towers, and reinforced or constructed 25 to 30 posts, the BSF has said. 

 This has been happening all across the International Border in the western sector, said K. Srinivasan, the BSFs deputy inspector general (G branch) at the Delhi headquarters. 

 But much of these activities are taking place in Jammu where 35 bunkers and 40 observatory towers were constructed. They are also digging up new trenches and raising the height of the bunds. 

 Although the constructions started immediately after the 2003 ceasefire, work has been stepped up in last few months. In the last five to six months, we are noticing more such activity. On our side we are maintaining our positions, the officer said. 

 Srinivasan said construction is not allowed up to 150 yards but Pakistan is doing it as close as 20 yards from the International Border.

 We have lodged protests against such constructions and took up the issue with the Pakistani Rangers in a recent bi-annual meeting. Instead of taking action, they are hurling allegations at us, he said.

 Drunk? Mop the floor

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Reforms on way

 New Delhi, Aug 1: The stinking drunk or the slippery pickpocket may soon be required to do community service rather than languish in jail, if recommendations of a committee are adopted by the government.

 The Madhava Menon committee on the draft national policy on criminal justice, in its report submitted to the home ministry today, has suggested that crimes be classified into four codes based on the gravity of the injury.

 The recommendations are meant to ease the burden on courts and prevent violation of human rights suffered by undertrials, sources said.

 The committee feels that dissatisfaction among people on the delivery of criminal justice stems mainly from the perception that money and influence result in double standards the rich often get away lightly while the poor suffer.

 The four-fold scheme would include a social welfare offences code (SWOC) for civil crimes, correctional offences code (COC) for crimes punishable with up to three years in jail or a fine, penal code (PC) for graver offences punishable with imprisonment beyond three years and economic offences code (EOC) for select cases that fall under the Indian Penal Code and relevant economic laws.

 Small marriage offences, prohibition offences, vagrancy and minor indiscipline on campuses and workplaces, for instance, can be brought under the SWOC, the committee feels. 

 The stress should be more on reparation and restitution rather than punishment, the report has said. Naturally, arrest and detention are unnecessary in such cases (except when violence is involved) and compensation and community service can better meet the ends of justice rather than incarceration of the offenders. 

 Therefore, these cases were felt fit to be entrusted to local bodies. 

 Under the COC, arrest and detention may be allowed, but all the cases could be open to settlement through lok adalats, plea bargaining and other alternative means, thus avoiding prolonged trials.

 Grave offences punishable with death fall under the penal code and deserve careful and quick processing under expert supervision with human rights protection guaranteed as in the Constitution, the report has said. There has to be greater accountability from enforcement agencies in these cases as they create public alarm and insecurity. 

 One tough area for the government would be designing the EOC, which includes offences that pose a threat to the economic security of the country. They might require multi-disciplinary, inter-state and transnational investigation to bring the guilty to book. 

 The panel has also favoured special schemes for protection of witnesses.

 On corruption in criminal justice, it has suggested a fair and transparent complaints redressal system in police, judiciary and prisons services.

 It has also mooted an independent national law enforcement agency to probe corruption as the CBI is not independent enough for the job. 

 The report has also said that all judges should disclose their assets annually.

 The committee has taken three broad approaches to policy development: criminal law reform; institutional reforms of police, prosecution, courts, prisons; and qualitative improvement of personnel in the criminal justice system.

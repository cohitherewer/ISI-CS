 Voila! Taj on the Thames

 AMIT ROY 

 The replica of the Taj floats past the Palace of Westminster on Tuesday

 London, July 17: Londons latest tourist attraction Taj on the Thames was unveiled today by Shilpa Shetty and Rahul Dravid. 

 The replica of the Taj, six metres tall and eight metres wide, started from Millbank Pier, where it was seen off at 8am by the Indian cricket captain. 

 The structure was placed on a barge which made stately progress along the Thames, past the Palace of Westminster and London Eye, to London Bridge Pier where it was received at 11.30am by Shilpa. 

 This is not working for me, the winner of Celebrity Big Brother told a large group of assembled TV cameramen and photographers, as her long, freshly shampooed and blow-dried hair was tossed about by the brisk river breeze. 

 But Britains favourite Bollywood actress had learnt a trick or two. She turned her face away from the lenses towards the Taj behind her, gathered her hair into the best possible order in the circumstances and then swung around quickly to present snappers with the most favourable image she could muster. 

 Shilpa and Dravid and the English actress Joanna Lumley were helping the mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, launch India Now, described as A Festival of India in London. 

 The festival, with 1,500 events covering every aspect of Indian culture from films to food, fashion, art, music, theatre and cinema, will run for three months during the summer. For a day, Regent Street, one of the premier shopping thoroughfares in London, will be decked out like an Indian bazaar.

 Livingstone, who is to visit India in November, said he will set up mayoral offices in Mumbai and Delhi with the intention of encouraging closer economic ties between the two countries. 

 The mayor has been careful not to state the festival is marking 60 years of Indian Independence. India has been independent for 60 years but it has been one of the first cultures of humanity, he said today. Its been there for thousands of years. A lot of people in the West are not aware how much India has given the world. 

 According to figures from the mayors office, in 2006, the number of Londoners of Indian origin was thought to total 430,000 6 per cent of the capitals resident population. Over 212,000 Indian visitors came to London last year and spent 139 million, which meant that for the first time, they spent even more than Japanese tourists.

 Over 4,000 students from India are now studying in London, contributing 60 million a year to its economy. In 2006, over 40 Indian films were made in London, with an estimated budget worth 14 million to London. And over 10,000 Indian-owned businesses in London employ 49,000 people. 

 Livingstone emphasised: We have got the largest Indian community in the world anywhere outside India, and they feel safe and at home here. We now have more Indian companies investing in London than the United States of America. 

 He went on: Increasingly, there is a better two-way trade and tourism. I want Indians to see London as their natural second home. They are welcome here; they help transform our city. 

 He wanted to encourage greater Indian investment in London. As Indian firms like Tata emerge as global giants and look to expand, we welcome Indian firms coming here, buying firms, taking part, keeping London a genuine world city in which every culture and every faith can get along. What we have done is tear down the barriers. There are too many barriers to investment. The world will be better when we see ourselves as citizens of one world. 

 Asked what he would see if he was an overseas visitor coming to London for the first time, he replied: I would actually go to Kew Gardens, to see the most amazing collection (of trees and plants), quite a few of them have come from India itself. Then Trafalgar Square, and then I would go and look at the British Museum and see something from every culture in the world. 

 Asked for her tips, Shilpa promptly pointed to the one of the seven wonders of the world behind her: For a start, they should come and see the Taj Mahal in the mini-version.

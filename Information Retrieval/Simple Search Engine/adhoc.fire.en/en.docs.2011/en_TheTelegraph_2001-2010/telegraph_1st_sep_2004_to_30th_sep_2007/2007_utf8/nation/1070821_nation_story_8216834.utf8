 Delhi deal edge over Beijing 

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, Aug. 20: India may have extracted a 123 Agreement for civilian nuclear cooperation with the US that is superior in some ways to the agreement that the US finalised with China 22 years ago. 

 The US-China Agreement for Cooperation related to peaceful uses of nuclear energy was prepared in 1985, but was ratified by the US Congress in 1998. 

 Unlike the Indo-US agreement, the US-China agreement was between two nuclear weapon states. 

 The 123 Agreement allows India rights to reprocess spent fuel, uninterrupted fuel supply, as well as pledges the future transfer of enrichment and reprocessing technologies for the civilian nuclear sector, sources said. 

 Under the agreement, India has pledged to set up a dedicated reprocessing facility where it would be allowed to reprocess safeguarded spent fuel. 

 Reprocessing allows the spent fuel to be turned into fresh fuel for second-generation fast breeder reactors, allowing further expansion of nuclear power capacity. 

 China, on the other hand, does not have an assured fuel supply from the US. It also does not automatically get rights to reprocess spent fuel. Article 5.2 of the US-China agreement says: Neither party has any plans to enrich to 20 per cent or greater, reprocess, or alter in form or content material transferred pursuant to this agreement or material. 

 China has no right to reprocess we have it, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said today in a special briefing to defend the 123 Agreement. China is denied a (reprocessing) right that India has acquired. 

 Sibal said the agreement assures India nuclear fuel, reactors and reprocessing rights. All aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle are granted by this agreement. Theres a commitment that our weapons programme will go on, he said. 

 The sources said the most significant difference between the two agreements is that while the US-China deal was between nuclear weapon states, the Indo-US deal allows India to be treated as a nuclear weapon power without formally receiving that title. 

 But reprocessing appears not to be ruled out entirely. Chinas agreement hints that should it wish to undertake such activities in future, the parties will promptly hold consultations to agree on a mutually agreeable arrangement.

 Digvijay defies diktat

 Bhopal, Feb. 15: Factionalism in the Madhya Pradesh Congress came to the fore today with AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh defying the party high command.

 Digvijay addressed a personal rally today in Sagar district, some 160 km north of Bhopal, with his band of supporters, disregarding a directive issued by Congress general secretary V. Narayanswamy that asked party leaders not to organise individual rallies.

 After the directive arrived in Bhopal last evening, state Congress chief Subhash Yadav immediately asked all party leaders, including Digvijay, to call off their meetings.

 But Digvijay paid no heed to it. Today, he said he follows orders from only three people Sonia Gandhi, Ahmad Patel and Narayanswamy. He was holding the rally to strengthen the party in the BJP-ruled state, he added.

 Subhash said the directive has made it clear that without the approval of the state Congress and the district committee concerned, a political meeting cannot be held. 

 Jagdish Yadav, who heads the Sagar district unit, dubbed Digvijays rally unauthorised. 

 However, state Congress spokesperson Manak Aggarwal, who is neither aligned to Digvijay nor to Subhash, said: It was too close to call it (the Sagar rally) off.

 Digvijay has also crossed swords with Gwalior MP Jyotiraditya Scindia. In the last couple of months, the two have held meetings in each others turf, trading charges. Digvijay made a dig at Scindia again today when he said he did not understand why some were wary of him when he had declared that he was not in the race for the chief ministers chair.

 The Jyotiraditya camp today sought to claim credit for influencing Sonia and Narayanswamy to take steps to rein in Digvijay.

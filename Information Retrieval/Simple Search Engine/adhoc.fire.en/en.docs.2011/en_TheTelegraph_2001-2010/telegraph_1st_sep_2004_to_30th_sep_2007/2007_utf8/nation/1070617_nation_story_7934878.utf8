 Ministry size rethink

 NISHIT DHOLABHAI

 New Delhi, June 16: The Centre wants to raise the cap on sizes of ministries to avert instability in the smaller states, where disappointed ruling group MLAs have repeatedly challenged or toppled their governments.

 Since such a change would require a constitutional amendment, the ruling alliance has prepared a draft proposal that will be discussed with other parties, Union minister Oscar Fernandes said today. Sources said a bill might be tabled in the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament.

 In 2003, the 91st amendment had laid down that the number of ministers in a state cannot be over 15 per cent of the seats in its Assembly or less than 12. In the small Northeast states with 60 seats, 12-member ministries (including the chief minister) have caused heartburn among those left out and sparked dissidence.

 What has worsened the power struggles is that states like Himachal Pradesh and those in the Northeast have several tribes and ethnic groups competing for representation.

 The labour and employment minister indicated that even if the cap were relaxed, states may not be allowed to return to the pre-2003 days when some had jumbo-sized ministries equalling half the strength of their Assemblies. But, he said, the number of ministers needed to be rationalised.

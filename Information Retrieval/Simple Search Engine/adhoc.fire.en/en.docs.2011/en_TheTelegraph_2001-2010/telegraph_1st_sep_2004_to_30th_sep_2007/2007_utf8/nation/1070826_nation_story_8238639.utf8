 Tables turned on Chair

 - Scolded MPs accuse Speaker of painting House black

 SANJAY K. JHA

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: The children have hit back at Somnath Chatterjee.

 The Lok Sabha Speaker, who regularly scolds MPs for behaving worse than children and threatens to throw them out, has been told it is he who has been lowering Parliaments image with his harsh words.

 You rebuke us at the slightest provocation. You tell us we dont deserve to be parliamentarians. You paint everybody black. Isnt that creating a negative image of the members? the Samajwadi Partys Mohan Singh asked Chatterjee at an all-party meeting on Thursday.

 The Speaker had called the meeting to discuss ways of punishing unruly MPs, who he believes have been lowering Parliaments dignity.

 Hours earlier, Chatterjee had told the MPs who had stalled the House over the nuclear deal that children are more disciplined than you. 

 Daily, I will send somebody out, he had thundered at a Congress member.

 But at the evening meeting, the tables were turned.

 The Speaker should speak the least but you speak so much; you lose temper more often than not; you think we are all irresponsible people who have no interest in Parliament... Mohan Singh went on.

 The BJP members, who nurse a grudge against Chatterjee, nodded in approval. The Left leaders and parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi sat quietly. 

 It was left to Chatterjee to douse the fire by accepting his mistake.

 Sources said the Speaker admitted he was perhaps getting agitated too soon. He requested the floor leaders to point it out to him if he overstepped.

 His humility pacified the BJP members who, too, had come with a litany of complaints.

 Chatterjee, an outstanding parliamentarian, has been concerned about members tendency to disrupt rather than debate and has repeatedly lost his cool in the House.

 Before the World Cup, he had advised the Indian team to show more discipline than the countrys MPs. Last week, he had threatened painful punishment for unruly members and evicted Keralas P.C. Thomas for abominable and disgusting behaviour.

 MPs feel he should be more tolerant. Perhaps, he will do better by striking a personal rapport with members and with a better sense of humour, former Speaker Manohar Joshi told The Telegraph.

 The meeting shot down the Speakers twin proposals no work, no pay for MPs who disrupt Parliament and a five-sitting suspension for those who rush to the well.

 The members argued that five minutes of ruckus could not be a criterion by which to judge an MP, who may be putting in a lot of work at House committees and study tours, asking questions and participating in debates.

 No one said anything about how some MPs have been expelled for accepting bribes to ask questions. 

 Five years ago, Indias MPs who have faced accusations ranging from murder to human trafficking had joined hands to defy a Supreme Court directive on poll candidates revealing their criminal records, educational qualifications, assets and liabilities. The members had felt the courts move would hurt democracy.

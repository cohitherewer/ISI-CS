 War room leak

 New Delhi, June 27: Fugitive Ravi Shankaran, accused of masterminding the leak of sensitive information from the navys top secret war room, has been spotted by the CBI in Europe, reports our special correspondent.

 The investigative agency, which is not revealing his whereabouts, is confident about bringing him back to India to face trial. 

 Shankaran, related to former navy chief Arun Prakash, had fled to London after the war room leak case was exposed last year. On the CBI request, a British court issued an arrest warrant against him in April, but by then Shankaran had slipped out of the country.

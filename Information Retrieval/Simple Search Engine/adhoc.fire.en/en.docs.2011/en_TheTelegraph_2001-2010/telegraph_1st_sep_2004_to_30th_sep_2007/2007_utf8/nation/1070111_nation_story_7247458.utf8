 Brett too busy for Bollywood

 London, Jan. 10 (PTI): Brett Lee has received a dozen offers from Bollywood but is unlikely to accept any of them because of time constraints.

 I have about a dozen offers for roles in Bollywood movies. I would love to get involved, but it is difficult because you need 50 or so days to shoot them, the Australian fast bowler told The Times today.

 His song with Asha Bhosle for the album Asha and Friends has reached No. 4 in Indian music charts in the first week of its release itself.

 Lee said he would devote time to write songs for Indian listeners after the World Cup in the West Indies.

 The fast bowler, who plays the guitar in his spare time, wrote the lyrics for his song with Asha in just 30 minutes when he was in India during the Champions Trophy in October-November.

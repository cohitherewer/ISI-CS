 Magic spell on Rao amp; the rest

 Lucknow, May 11: Living goddess or a miracle of democracy?

 In June 1995, when Mayavati became chief minister of Uttar Pradesh for the first time, the then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao was away in France.

 Addressing captains of trade and industry in Paris, Rao described Mayavati as a miracle of democracy and marvelled in jest how a woman hailing from the most neglected section of society had assumed the powerful office of chief minister.

 Today, the miracle of democracy was paying respects to herself. At the Prerna Sthal temple inside the BSP headquarters, Mayavati stood in silence for a minute before three tall deities B.R. Ambedkar, Kanshi Ram and herself. 

 As she stepped out of the temple, it began to rain. Some Lucknowites, who were sweating in the 40-degree heat and humidity for over a fortnight, took it as divine approval for the change of guard in Uttar Pradesh.

 Outside, the crowd went berserk to have a look at Behenji.

 A man said he and his son did not have money to eat but were happy. Nand Kumar, who claimed the Election Commission had snatched his livelihood when it stopped sale of tiny stuffed elephants the BSP symbol said: I am happy in spite of being hungry. Our worst days are over. My goddess has won in spite of everyone.

 Other streets of Lucknow, too, showed extraordinary scenes.

 Apart from the usual bursting of crackers, playing with blue colour and distribution of laddoos, the poorest of the poor could barely hide their glee.

 In the afternoon, a rickshaw-puller was sweating profusely but smiling. He was a Muslim. Asked why he was smiling, his eyes lit up with happiness as he replied: Aaj garib ki jeet hui hai (Today a poor has won).

 In the posh Hazratgunj area, it was business as usual. But in the slums and narrow bylanes of Nazeerabad and Wazirabad, Dalits, Muslims and Brahmins were seen exchanging sweets and greeting each other.

 Inside the temple, a flash of memories must have come to Mayavatis mind years ago, she was just out of college and busy preparing for the civil services when she met Kanshi Ram for the first time. He had told her matter-of-factly: So you wish to become DM (district magistrate)? Follow my path and you will become CM one day.

 Maya, as she is popularly called, will become chief minister for the fourth time, but this time it is different.

 There was no Kanshi Ram to guide her. The BSP had no star campaigner, none from Bollywood. The media had largely ignored her.

 But as Mayavati today said, these drawbacks made her more resolute.

 BSP upbeat, others down

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Lucknow, May 2: The ruling Samajwadi Party is nervous. The Opposition BJP is banking on allies to deliver. The Congress has little to crow about.

 A day before 52 seats in east Uttar Pradesh go to polls in the sixth and penultimate round, most of the mainstream parties seem low on confidence. Only the BSP is looking forward to add to the 15 it won last time.

 The Samajwadi Party, which won 20 seats from the region in 2002, faces hostile publicity this time for the way it has sheltered criminal elements like Mukhtar Ansari, Atiq Ahmad and Dhananjay Singh, who have a string of murder and abduction cases against them.

 Last year, the Supreme Court rapped the Mulayam Singh Yadav government for trying to protect a Samajwadi Party MP and his brother, accused in the murder of BJP legislator Krishnanand Rai.

 But if Mulayams party is tense, the BJP is far from euphoric, though the region falls under the extended command area of the temple movement.

 The Ram and roti slogans it raised hardly helped during the last polls when it managed just 11 seats. This time, it has struck a deal with Sonelal Patel, a Kurmi leader who runs the Apna Dal, and has also tied up with the Janata Dal (United), a Kurmi-based party with some pockets of influence.

 The Apna Dal had, however, bagged just three seats in the last Assembly elections. Its pockets of influence are limited to Gangapur, Nawabganj and Allahabad West. 

 One possible fallout of its deal with the BJP is the party might alienate its Muslim voters. 

 The Congress, which won just one seat from the region in 2002, regained some ground in last years local body polls because of a shift in Muslim votes. Allahabad has got a Congress mayor after a long time and the party hopes to improve its score this time. But simmering faction rivalry is proving to be a block.

 Only Mayavatis BSP, worst hit by the criminal-politician nexus, might turn out to be the gainer, thanks to the anti-incumbency undercurrent over the law and order situation.

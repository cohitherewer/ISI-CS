 Pataudi cricket trophy

 AMIT ROY 

 Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi

 London, July 17: Whenever England and India play Test cricket in England in future, starting with the three Test series about to get under way at Lords on Thursday, the winner will be awarded the Pataudi Trophy. 

 The formal announcement is due to be made shortly but a source at Lords told The Telegraph today that the Pataudi does not refer either to Pataudi Senior, the father, or to Pataudi Junior, the son, but to the famous cricketing family. 

 This is a clever English way of coming up with a new name for the trophy that will have resonance in both England and India. 

 Pataudi Senior, Iftikhar Ali Khan, eighth in line, played for England and India, while his son, Pataudi Junior, Mansur Ali Khan, ninth in line, captained India. 

 Pataudi Junior, 66, who is married to actress Sharmila Tagore and is the father of Bollywood stars Saif and Soha Ali Khan, became captain of India at 21. He played 46 Tests for India. 

 In his youth, he had been captain of Oxford University, for whom his father hit 238 not out against Cambridge in 1931 this stood as a record until 2005 (when it was eclipsed by Salil Oberoi from Delhi). 

 Playing for England, Pataudi Senior made a century on his debut in the Ashes tour of 1932-33 but got dropped after expressing strong disapproval of the use of bodyline bowling by his captain, Douglas Jardine. He deemed this to be against the spirit of the game. 

 He later captained India for three Tests during a tour of England in 1946.

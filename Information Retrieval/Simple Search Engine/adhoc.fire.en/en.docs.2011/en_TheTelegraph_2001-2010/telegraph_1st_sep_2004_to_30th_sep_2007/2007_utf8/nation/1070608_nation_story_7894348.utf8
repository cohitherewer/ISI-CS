 Indian dead in Oman cyclone

 JOHN MARY AND OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, June 7: An Indian has died and eight from the country are missing in a cyclone that hit Oman yesterday.

 The victim has been identified as Prakash, a Malayali from Mangalore, Karnataka.

 Among the missing, four hail from Kerala, three from Andhra Pradesh and one from Punjab, the external affairs ministry has said.

 Seven of the missing Indians have been identified as Dharmarajan (Andhra), Sajit Kumar (Calicut, Kerala), Udayan (Guruvayur, Kerala), Sreenu (Andhra), Sami (Andhra), Muhammad Ali (Ernakulam, Kerala) and Binu (Ernakulam, Kerala). The name of the missing person from Punjab is not known yet. 

 The sultanate has 3.86 lakh Indians.

 Oman royal police spokesman Abdullah al-Harthi had earlier said at least 12 people were killed in the Gonu cyclone. With winds up to 170 km an hour, the super cyclone slammed Omans eastern coast and waves up to 12 metres high lashed the towns.

 The Oman government has set up a casualty bureau where the dead and injured are being tracked. Two round-the-clock control rooms have been set up for the Indians one in the external affairs ministry in Delhi and another in the Indian embassy in Muscat. The numbers of the control room at the Muscat embassy are 00968-24813838 and 00968-24812936. 

 The storm turned the streets of the capital into rivers, severing electricity and phone lines. The death toll could rise as relief officials said floods were hampering access to some areas. 

 In Kerala, there is panic. Many in the northern districts in the Malabar region have their kin in Oman.

 K.N. Abdul Khader in Kozhikode, said: We have been glued to the TV since we heard of the cyclone. We have several relatives working in Muscat. What else can we do? Even Norkas help desk numbers are busy.

 Non-Resident Keralites Affairs (Norka) department has set up a help desk in Thiruvananthapuram. This evening, it confirmed the death of Prakash in a press release.

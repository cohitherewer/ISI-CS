 Temple trip after wedding

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, April 21: The wedding is done but the temple trips arent.

 Before the Aishwarya-Abhishek marriage, the Bachchans and their would-be bahu had toured shrine after shrine in the north to wash away the Mars jinx in her horoscope. Tomorrow morning, they will lead a 30-strong group to Tirupati in the south to seek Balajis blessings.

 During the five-hour visit, the VIPs will be offered prasadam on gold and silver plates and served a special meal of 15-odd varieties of sweets. The bride will be given a gold wedding chain and each visitor a silk shawl.

 The group which will include Ashs parents and the families of Amar Singh and Anil Ambani will fly in from Mumbai on two private aircraft and be driven to the temple in 10 Mercs and Chevrolets.

 During the April 15 visit to seek pre-wedding blessings for AbAsh, Amitabh had made the biggest-ever donation to the shrine by an actor, worth nearly Rs 3 crore in cash, cheque and jewellery. How much he would donate this time is not known.

 During a previous visit two months ago, Amitabh had asked how much a diamond-studded ornament for the idols right hand would cost and was told it would be around Rs 9 crore, said temple official K.V. Ramanachari. But its his decision there is no compulsion in Tirupati.

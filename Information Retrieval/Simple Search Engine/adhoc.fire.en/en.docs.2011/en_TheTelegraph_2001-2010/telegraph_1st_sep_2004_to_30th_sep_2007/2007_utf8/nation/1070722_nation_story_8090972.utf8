 New Delhi, July 21: Room 13, 1st floor, Parliament House.

 Excited voices rose and fell in the packed room. Inside were top Congress leaders and journalists.

 No, it wasnt the Prime Ministers official chamber, or that of Sonia Gandhis, but of a man said to have a computer tucked away somewhere in his seasoned mind.

 He, too, looked excited and relaxed depending on the drift of the conversation or the question that a scribe had just thrown at him.

 As Pratibha Patils victory looked more and more certain and the television screen beamed news flashes and the would-be Presidents visage, the journalists in the room noticed how wistful he looked and sounded, if only fleetingly.

 If the Left had its way, Pranab Mukherjee may have been in her place on TV today. When somebody made a remark to that effect out of Mukherjees earshot a minor Congress functionary who had been flitting in and out said the margin would have been a record nine lakh. Not Pratibhas three-lakh plus.

 Mukherjee may have missed his date with destiny but there was no trace of regret or bitterness as he sat amid the drone of voices.

 Sonias crack team for the poll was in his room at 10am sharp to monitor the counting and recall on Dadas mental computer the strength of legislature parties, given the frequent shift in loyalties, and if the figures tallied with the results streaming in.

 Mukherjee jotted down the results on his pad and, within minutes, could tell if anyone had cross-voted. For instance, when the figures from Himachal Pradesh came in, he said, without batting an eyelid, four Congress MLAs may have voted for Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. It squared with reports of recent anti-party activity.

 Ahmed Patel, Suresh Pachauri, Janardhan Dwivedi and Motilal Vora could barely concentrate on the lunch Mukherjee had ordered from the Parliament canteen.

 Patel, who is from Gujarat, noted with satisfaction that six BJP MLAs had shifted allegiance to Pratibha. Pachauri, who is from Madhya Pradesh, beamed every time Congresss chief whip in the Lok Sabha, Madhusudan Mistry, dashed inside to say how one more BJP MLA had spoilt his vote by inscribing the ballot paper with a Jai Shri Ram or an Om.

 There was a moment of excitement when Mistry sprinted in with figures from Orissa which suggested that the BJD had voted lock, stock and barrel for Pratibha. The end of the NDA, Dada, said a scribe.

 Finally, when the TV announced that Pratibha had won, Mukherjee asked his peon to bring rosogollas.

 Mukherjee said in these health conscious times, nobody would have more than one rosogolla but, when he was a boy, he remembered it was normal for a foodie worth his palate to polish off a pot of 40 or 50 after a hearty meal.

 When the box was opened, arranged in a symmetry were not rosogollas of his boyhood but saffron laddoos from Chandni Chowk.

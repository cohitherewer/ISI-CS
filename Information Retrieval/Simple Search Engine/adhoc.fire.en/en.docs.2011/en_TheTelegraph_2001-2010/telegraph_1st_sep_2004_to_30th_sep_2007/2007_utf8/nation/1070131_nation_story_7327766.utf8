 At 92, bridge awaits rebirth

 Rameshwaram, Jan. 30: It has lived through two world wars, was a silent witness to the cannons of freedom that boomed one midnight 60 years ago and set the stage for a similar shape hundreds of miles away.

 Now, at 92, the 2.06-km-long Pamban rail bridge that stretches across the sea is about to be born again.

 Scientists and engineers are braving tough marine conditions to ensure that the countrys first cantilever-type bridge which connects the mainland with the pilgrim island of Rameshwaram and is the precursor to Calcuttas Howrah bridge retains its uniqueness while being converted to broad gauge.

 It is a very unique rail bridge, there is no other bridge like this in the country, said Madurai divisional railway manager Hemant Kumar, who is overseeing the project, part of the conversion of the 264-km-long Tiruchirappalli-Manamadurai-Rameshwaram metre-gauge line.

 The bridge across the Palk Straits was opened to traffic in 1914, the year the First World War started and four years after the British, who ruled India then, decided to build a viaduct with lifting spans. 

 The lifting spans parts of a bridge between the supports opened when small ships needed to navigate that way. When the spans came down and got locked, the bridge became a passage for trains.

 The bridge paved the way for a rail-cum-ferry service between India and Sri Lanka, then Ceylon. 

 Train passengers from the mainland got off at Dhanushkodi off Rameshwaram where they took a boat to Taliamannar in Sri Lanka. But a cyclonic storm one December night in 1964 swept away Dhanushkodi and even the rail tracks.

 Kumar said the initial plan was the gauge conversion would stop at the mainland in Mandapam, leaving the metre-gauge rail bridge up to Rameshwaram untouched. But maintaining a metre-gauge line for just 20 to 25 km would have been tough. So the railway decided to go the whole hog.

 Even this was fraught with difficulties. We also thought of a new rail bridge across the Palk Straits, discarding the existing one, Kumar said.

 The railway was to call for global tenders, but initial estimates put the cost for this small stretch at Rs 500 crore. Then railway board member (engineering) Jarnhar visited the spot, Kumar said. He gave us the confidence that we ourselves can do the gauge conversion.

 Kumar said work is now going on. At a cost of Rs 20 crore, he added with a smile.

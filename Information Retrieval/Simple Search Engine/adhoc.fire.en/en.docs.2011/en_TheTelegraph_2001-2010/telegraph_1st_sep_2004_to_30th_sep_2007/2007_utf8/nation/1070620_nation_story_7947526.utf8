 Zahira: Role shift?

 Ahmedabad, June 19: At 21, Zahira Sheikh has already played more roles than most people do in a lifetime. Now she is ready for a new one: as a politician.

 The witness in one of the 2002 Gujarat pogroms highest-profile massacres, who turned hostile and was jailed for perjury, yesterday said: I want to serve society and work for the poor and fight for the exploited classes.

 She said she would fight elections if a political party backed her, but the controversies around her seem to have made her an untouchable for the BJP and the Congress.

 To Congress spokesman Shaktisinh Gohil, her comments were a petty issue on which my party does not want to comment. State BJP president Purushottam Rupala was equally dismissive.

 Zahira, released in March from a jail in Nashik after serving a one-year term, now lives in Mumbai with a relative. She slipped into hometown Vadodara yesterday to file her tax returns so that she could she access her bank accounts, frozen on the Supreme Courts orders.

 She denied she had a nice sum stashed away in her two bank accounts, in Vadodara and Mumbai. If I had money, would I live the way I do? Would I need to survive on my earnings from embroidery and stitching?

 She also denied accepting a bribe from Gujarat MLA Madhu Srivastava of the BJP for changing her statement after identifying several accused in the Best Bakery massacre. I want to forget the incident (the killings) for ever, she said.

 The carnage, however, is likely to continue to cast its shadow on her. Her flip-flop, which led to the case being transferred to Mumbai, has made her a traitor in her communitys eyes.

 Zahira said she would love to live in Vadodara, but unsure of her safety, she is considering a shift to Varanasi where one of her uncles lives.

 Zahira doesnt know where her mother Sehrunissa, jailed for three months for perjury, now lives. Days after Zahira was sent to jail, her ailing brother Nafitullah had died.

 She said jail had changed her outlook and she felt closer to Allah. She used to wake at 5 am and offer namaz five times a day. She learnt embroidery and stitching, and computers.

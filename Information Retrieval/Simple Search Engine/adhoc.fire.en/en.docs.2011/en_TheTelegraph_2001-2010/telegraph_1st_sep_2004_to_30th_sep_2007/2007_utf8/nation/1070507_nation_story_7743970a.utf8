 Stand up for Husain, friends tell fraternity

 Amit Roy 

 London, May 6: M.F. Husain rsquo;s friends in London, where he is expected next month, have urged the arts and political establishment to stand up for ldquo;India rsquo;s greatest living artist rdquo;.

 Husain, who will turn 92 on September 17, has been living in Dubai for the past 8-10 months because he fears he might be the target of an attack if he returns to Mumbai.

 ldquo;He rsquo;s a free bird and likes to move around, go for a walk or an Irani chai, but he fears someone might push him violently, rdquo; said a friend. Husain had told the friend: ldquo;If I fall down, I may not get up again. rdquo;

 ldquo;He rsquo;s very frail, rdquo; the friend added. 

 Husain has loyal supporters in London who accused his Hindu militant detractors in India of orchestrating a national and international campaign against him. ldquo;They are taunting the authorities and police for not taking action against him, rdquo; a source said. 

 The arts community in Britain mdash; and in America mdash; have ridiculed the charge that Husain rsquo;s paintings have depicted Hindu goddesses in an obscene manner. When his paintings went on display at Asia House in London, high commissioner Kamalesh Sharma reflected the Indian government rsquo;s official thinking and hailed Husain as ldquo;India rsquo;s greatest living artist rdquo; when inaugurating the exhibition. 

 The exhibition was later cancelled when vandals defaced two of the paintings by daubing them with red paint. 

 Nevertheless, major solo exhibitions of Husain rsquo;s work are planned in London. 

 Human rights groups in London want art galleries and artists in India to show greater support for Husain. His friend pointed out: ldquo;Prices of Indian art at auctions in the West have gone up mainly due to the pioneering work by Husain. rdquo; 

 Husain, he said, was expected to attend one of his exhibitions in America before coming to London in June. 

 Unlike Asia House in London, the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts mdash; where Epic India: M.F. Husain rsquo;s Mahabharata Project went on display last year and will remain so until June 3 mdash; appears to be made of sterner stuff. The exhibition features 20 works inspired by Husain rsquo;s vision of the Mahabharata. 

 The Boston Globe reported that one anti-Husain group, the Hindu Janajagruti Samiti, wrote to the museum before Epic India opened in November, urging its officials to cancel the exhibition. 

 ldquo;Mr Husain has a history of repeatedly and callously hurting Hindu sentiments by depicting Hindu deities in lewd, compromising positions, rdquo; the letter said.

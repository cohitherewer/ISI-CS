 Students row unites Kashmir 

 OUR BUREAU 

 Srinagar/Bangalore, April 6: A clash between two groups of students in a Karnataka college has rocked Kashmir, and united its political fraternity.

 The incident a Kashmiri fresher was allegedly ragged by Bihari students has brought together the states mainstream and separatist leaders to fight alleged discrimination against Kashmiris across the country.

 On April 3, 28 Kashmiri students and one from Bihar were arrested after the unrest, which took place in Ghousia College of Engineering, Ramanagaram, about 45 km from Bangalore. At least four students were badly injured.

 Union minister for water resources Saifuddin Soz and Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti spoke to H.D. Kumaraswamy who assured them police would act without bias. The college falls within the chief ministers constituency.

 The Karnataka government has assured me that the safety and security of all Kashmiri students present in the state will be ensured and every effort would be made so that no such incidents recur, Mehbooba said. The arrests have created panic and anguish in the state, especially among families whose wards are studying in different colleges of Karnataka. 

 Mehbooba had lived in Bangalore for many years when militancy was at its peak in Kashmir.

 National Conference chief Omar Abdullah also expressed anguish and demanded early release of the students. 

 Separatists like the Hizb-ul Mujahideen have condemned their arrest, adding that Kashmiris are becoming vulnerable to victimisation outside the Valley. 

 Chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad after similar incidents in the past had taken up the issue with various chief ministers. The moderate Hurriyat faction, too, said the arrests prove no part of India is safe for Kashmiris. Theres no future left for Kashmiris in fields like trade and education in India where harassment of Kashmiris is considered a national service, a spokesman said. 

 K. Srinivas, the district superintendent of police, said the students have been put in judicial custody till April 16. Students from Bihar and UP often clash here. But this is the first time that Kashmiri students are involved, he said. 

 The guardians of some students and their classmates have said they would move a bail application on Saturday.

 In Srinagar, families have hit the streets. G.H. Gurkhu, uncle of a detained student, Haseem, said the polices claim that they indulged in hooliganism is wrong. 

 This appears to be a part of deep-rooted conspiracy against Kashmiris. Our children have gone there with great expectations, he said.

 No-show capers at film festival

 The picture didnt look too bright when the curtains went up at the Hyderabad International Film Festival last Friday.

 Even the presence of 40 global delegates, including many from Europe, failed to fill an all-too-obvious void left by the absence of Telugu titans Chiranjeevi and Nagarjuna. Among local actresses, only Jayasudha showed up.

 The event has been organised by the Hyderabad Film Club and the Andhra Pradesh Film Directors Association, but many from its fraternity gave it a miss. This included a film chamber of commerce and an artists association.

 Officially, too, the show didnt have much going for it. Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy didnt turn up for the inauguration. Information minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir, who stood in for him, spent only a few minutes. 

 The festival will be an annual feature and its objective is to provide a platform to local talents, technicians and movie producers and distributors, said director Prakash Reddy, the brain behind the event. Filmmaker Gautam Ghosh filled the missing glamour quotient.

 This ones not clicking

 As the Tamil Nadu Assembly was getting ready for a stormy budget session last week, the media preparing to cover the annual ritual found itself running into rough weather.

 A circular from the states information department advised photographers and television crews to take pictures only for the first few minutes of the budget speech.

 Once they are over and done with, they were told to retire to the Press lounge, near the entrance of the Assembly. Those who fail to take the advice would have to face action by the Speaker, the communique warned.

 Not too many scribes remember having received such an order, at least not in recent years. Journalists feel the advice no one really thinks it as harmless as it sounds amounts to an undeclared quasi-censorship.

 Kalam shows them around

 It was one of those occasions when A.P.J. Abdul Kalam took a delegation on a guided tour. Usually, its the President who is shown around exhibitions and conferences, meeting dignitaries and peering over works of art.

 But last week, in a break with tradition, the former scientist hosted not a visiting foreign head of state, but 6,000 farmers. While at the sprawling estate, the farmers from 19 states were chaperoned around the Mughal Garden, bio-fuel park, herbal garden, musical garden, spiritual garden and the nutrition garden.

 Many in the huge contingent had come from Bihar, a state the President had toured not too long ago amid appreciation about the changes being brought about in its villages. 

 Agriculture scientists were there, too, scanning the equipment and techniques used in the estates kitchen gardens.

 Husain charity

 This was brush stroke with a difference. M.F. Husain recently gave away the $1,32,000 (Rs 57.42 lakh) that one of his paintings raised at a Christies auction last week to an NGO working with children and women. 

 All the funds raised from the auction (in New York) will go towards our projects, including the most recent campaign called Read India, said Sangeeta Chawla Joshi, president and trustee of Pratham, the NGO that got the cash. 

 The NGO works with over 10,000 grassroot teachers, mainly women. ICICI Bank chief Narayan Vaghul, who was present at the auction, thanked the ace painter, saying his contribution would go a long way in changing the lives of the countrys under-privileged children.

 Delhi: Padma Vibhushan recipients Radha and Raja Reddy, with their daughter Yamini, and a handful of disciples, will perform on March 29 at Kamani Auditorium. From Krishna-Radha and Adi-Shakti to Saraswati and Shiva, follow the subtle changes in their movements. Time: 7 pm.

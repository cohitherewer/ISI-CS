The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 New Delhi, Aug. 24: A Calcutta Malayali elected the new president of St Stephens College students body plans to do what none of his predecessors have managed in the colleges 126-year-history unionise students. 

 Unlike Prakash Karat and the comrades from his city or home state, Boban Verghese Paul doesnt have an opinion on the nuclear deal, but is clear in his mind that the students body he now heads needs greater powers. 

 Honestly, I havent been following the nuclear deal. But one of my top priorities will be to try and get the Students Union Society (SUS) greater powers, he told The Telegraph amid celebrations minutes after his victory was announced. The alumnus of Calcuttas St Xaviers School is now a final-year economics student. 

 Bobans opponent was Miguel Queah, from Assam. Authorities said this was the first election in their memory that has been contested solely by students from the east. 

 The SUS functions just like any other extra-curricular society, Boban explained, mostly organising events at the college. However, all decision-making powers have remained with the administration. 

 College officials have always maintained that behind the decision to offer the SUS limited powers lies the desire to keep St Stephens apolitical. That is a stand many students, and most parents, have supported. 

 The poor state of affairs at other Delhi University colleges, where students, teachers and staff frequently go on strike, strengthens the hands of college officials each time the demand for greater powers to the union comes up. 

 In his goal, Boban will have support from unexpected quarters: his opponent Miguel wants the word society dropped from the name. 

 Students need a forum that can really address their problems. The SUS needs to be a full-fledged union, Miguel said. 

 Boban received 617 of the 775 votes polled. The rest went to Miguel.

 New Delhi, March 30: In the run-up to the annual gathering of South Asias top leadership, Bangladesh has sent the strongest signal in recent memory against terrorism by executing religious extremists who unleashed a reign of terror in that country.

 The hanging of six Jamaat-ul Mujahideen terrorists by the army-backed government of Fakhruddin Ahmad in various Bangladesh jails is being quietly welcomed by New Delhi.

 The execution comes 24 hours before foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee meets Bangladesh counterpart Iftekhar Chowdhury to kickstart the faltering relationship between the countries in a special bilateral meeting on the eve of the Saarc summit.

 Tight-lipped on record, government sources said they were pleased that the Dhaka government was sending such a strong signal against Islamic fundamentalism and extremism, which should be a model for the rest of South Asia.

 Delhis new-found realism implies that just as it has been ready to deal with military dictatorships in Pakistan and Myanmar, doing business with a military regime in Dhaka especially one that sends positive signals against terrorism should be welcomed with open arms.

 The six terrorists among them the infamous Bangla Bhai and Shaikh Abdur Rahman had let loose a reign of terror, hanging people who contested their brand of severe Islamic law. They were hanged for carrying out a series of perfectly executed blasts in 63 of Bangladeshs 64 districts two years ago, and subsequently killing two judges.

 Delhi clearly hopes Dhaka will take a similar tough approach to Indian insurgent camps in Bangladesh that were being nurtured by the BNP government of Khaleda Zia for the last so many years.

 With the recent arrest of Tarique Rahman, son of Khaleda, Delhi feels the tide may at last be turning in the Indo-Bangla relationship.

 Tomorrows talks are significant because Dhaka asked for a special meeting with Mukherjee in the run-up to the Saarc summit.

 Much is on the agenda besides terrorism, such as kickstarting trade and investment (such as the Tata project), demarcating the last 6.5 km of the border, reopening transit lines and improving people-to-people relationship.

 With connectivity being the theme of the Saarc summit, India hopes an economic restructuring of the subcontinent, especially with Bangladesh and Pakistan, could well be the way out of political crises.

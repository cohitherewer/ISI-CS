 Vendor mass suicide

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Aug. 1: Five of the 11 physically challenged vendors who drank poison at an anti-eviction protest in Varanasi last evening have died.

 Police have accused union leaders and some electronic media crew of provoking the suicides, saying there was no need for the vendors to take the step as they had been promised a rehabilitation package.

 Two union leaders, Ravi Banerji and Namo Upadhyaya, have been arrested after senior superintendent of police S.P. Shirodkar ordered criminal cases to be registered against them and the representatives of some news channels last night. But the channels hit back, saying the police were targeting the media to deflect attention from their failure.

 Mahesh Gupta, special secretary in Uttar Pradeshs home department, said the role of some representatives of the electronic media was under probe. 

 Of the five deaths, three occurred last night and two today. Five vendors are in critical condition at the district hospital. One is battling for his life in the intensive care unit of the BHU hospital.

 Investigations are under way to find out what poisonous substance was consumed. On July 28, the vendors had been assured that a rehabilitation plan would be offered to them if their shops are removed, district magistrate Veena Kumari Meena said. An investigation headed by additional district magistrate Indra Vikram Singh has been ordered.

 The vendors were protesting Varanasi Nagar Nigams encroachment drive in the Gurubag area, where roads are crammed and traffic snarls common.

 Shirodkar claimed some of those who swallowed poison were not vendors but beggars lured into the act for money. 

 There was also the stench of an internal tussle within the civic body in the deaths. Fuelling the suspicion was the simmering rivalry between municipal commissioner Lalji Rai and councillors loyal to mayor Kaushalendra Singh.

 Vendors who fear demolitions have been used as guinea pigs by leaders at the behest of a large group lobbying against the municipal commissioner, a former member of the civic body said. Rai, too, said a group within the civic body opposed to his development work was creating the trouble.

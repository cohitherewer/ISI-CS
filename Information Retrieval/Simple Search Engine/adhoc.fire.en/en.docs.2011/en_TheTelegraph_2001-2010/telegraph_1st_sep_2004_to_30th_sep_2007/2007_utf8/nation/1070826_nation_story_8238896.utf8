The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 PM date with farmers, reactors

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 25: The Prime Minister is expected to dedicate two nuclear reactors to the nation next week even as his party leadership battles to save the nuclear deal.

 Manmohan Singh, who will be here on a two-day visit on August 30-31, will dedicate Tarapur Atomic Power Stations 3 and 4 to the country. They are indigenously-built 540MW pressurised heavy water reactors and the biggest single power-producing units in the country.

 Singhs trip to Tarapur has been in the offing for some time, said officials at the department of atomic energy. Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission Anil Kakodkar and Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd chairman and managing director S.K. Jain are expected to be present at the event.

 The Prime Minister could also visit the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre at Trombay to address scientists and technocrats, officials added.

 From Tarapur, Singh is expected to make his way to Vidarbha, which has seen a spate of farmer suicides in the past two years.

 He had visited the region in July last year and announced a relief package of Rs 3,750 crore aimed at easing the burden of cotton farmers reeling under a rural credit crisis. 

 But Vidarbha activists said the package had failed to stem the suicides, and, in fact, post-July 2006 till December, the number had increased. According to figures available with the Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti, a farmer advocacy group, from January to July 2006 there had been an average of 70 suicides per month, which shot up to 90-100 after the Prime Ministers package was announced. 

 The package, the Samiti claimed, did not concede two crucial demands of the farmers complete waiver on all loans and a minimum reserve price of Rs 2,700 per quintal under the cotton monopoly scheme where the government buys the produce at a predetermined price. In Maharashtra, the price had fallen to Rs 1,700 per quintal in 2005-06.

 The Prime Minister is likely to review the implementation of the package at a meeting with chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh in Mumbai.

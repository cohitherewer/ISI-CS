 Monsoon manual for airports

 New Delhi, July 8: Airport officials have been told to give pilots precise information on wet runways throughout the monsoon season following repeated skidding of planes during landing across the country.

 The directorate-general of civil aviation has asked air traffic controllers to fill pilots in on how wet the runway is, the expected friction levels, and details of the crosswind and tailwind during heavy rain.

 Aviation experts said a combination of both crosswind (surface wind blowing from the side) and tailwind (wind blowing in the same direction as the aircraft) is considered dangerous.

 The directorate has also asked government and private airport operators to maintain proper runway conditions.

 Officials said that more than 45 per cent of all landing incidents happen during the four-month wet season. Aviation experts claim that the principal reason is that the pilots do not receive detailed information on runway conditions.

 During heavy rain, the depth of water along the runway can vary depending on the slope. If a pilot is merely informed that the runway is wet, he would assume that the depth of water is 3mm or less.

 However, the actual level could even be in inches. This means the plane would need to use a longer stretch of the runway during landing, an expert said.

 On a dry runway, a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 would need a 6,000-foot stretch, but on a wet runway, the requirement could go up to 8,400 feet.

 Instances of skidding during landing have been reported from airports in Kerala, Indore and Mumbai in the past few weeks. Sources said the directorate had begun taking action against airlines and pilots who had ignored its guidelines, but did not give details.

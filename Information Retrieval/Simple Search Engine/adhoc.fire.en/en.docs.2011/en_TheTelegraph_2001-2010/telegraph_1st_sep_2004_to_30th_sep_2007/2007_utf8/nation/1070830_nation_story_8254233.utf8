 12 missing after Maoist ambush

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Raipur, Aug. 29: Twelve policemen from a road-opening party went missing in Dantewada this evening after a Maoist ambush.

 Road-opening parties are security teams that sanitise an area where a road is to be built before the work starts.

 Two platoons of 40 personnel left for Tadmetla in the district, about 550km south of Raipur, this afternoon, inspector-general of police Girdhari Nayak said. 

 As soon as the security personnel reached the spot, Maoists cordoned off the area and started firing indiscriminately from all sides. 

 A fierce gunbattle followed and the rebels retreated after an hour. The policemen then returned to Jagargunda the police station under which the area falls around 4pm and found that 12 of their group were missing.

 The possibility of the missing personnel returning alive is bleak, Nayak said.

 Of the 28 who made it back, six were injured and have been admitted to hospital. 

 Dantewada superintendent of police Rahul Sharma left for the spot with other senior officers and additional force to search for the missing men. They will walk the 40km as using a vehicle could invite another ambush.

 Of those missing, eight are special police officers villagers trained and armed by the state to fight the rebels and three are Chhattisgarh Armed Force jawans. The Jagargunda station house officer, leading the teams, is also missing.

 Sonia faces power queue 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 10: A brief business-cum-holiday break over, Sonia Gandhi will get down to the task of finalising the UPAs presidential nominee on Tuesday.

 However, if the Congress chief glances at the list of appointment-seekers at 10 Janpath, she will discover that a large number of them are aspirants for Vice-President and cabinet berths.

 Congress insiders said the presidential and vice-presidential polls are linked, though the election of the latter is scheduled for August. The UPA strategy is to bid for both posts.

 Sources close to Sonia said she was prepared to offer the Vice-Presidents post to the Left parties if they wish to field Somnath Chatterjee.

 The Lok Sabha Speaker is believed to be lukewarm to the idea. Recently, when a politician sounded Chatterjee, the lawyer had a weak laugh, saying that for all practical purposes he would be shifted from the Lok Sabha to the Rajya Sabha. The Vice-President is the presiding officer of the Rajya Sabha.

 It remains to be seen if the Left will push for anyone else the name of the Bengal Speaker, Hashim Abdul Halim, is doing the rounds.

 However, if the Left parties turn down the offer, there is no dearth of aspirants from within the Congress. Former Manipur chief minister Reishang Keishing and Goa governor S.C. Jamir are lobbying for the post. 

 But a section of party leaders feels that Sonia should consider a woman candidate. In this context, the names of Margaret Alva and Mohsina Kidwai are gaining currency.

 Several party leaders are eyeing cabinet berths, too, in the event of a likely shuffle after the presidential polls. Mines minister Sisram Ola and panchayati rajs Mani Shankar Aiyar are among those vulnerable. The grudge against Aiyar is that the outspoken minister has been making too many and too frequent noises against the government.

 Manmohan Singhs call for a consensus on the presidential candidate has failed to get a favourable response from the BJP. Its spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad made light of the Prime Ministers statement expressing hope that the NDA would accept the UPAs candidate for Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 Let them (UPA) first sort out their problems. The Left proposes, someone disposes, some ally opposes, Prasad said. Mr Vajpayee will decide at an appropriate time, but as for me, Mr Shekhawat enjoys widespread respect.

 Lalu Prasads RJD that held its national executive meeting today dismissed the possibility of cross voting in the UPA. 

 Senior leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said the party was against the BJPs ideology and would fully support any candidate of the ruling coalition. 

 Not a single vote will be transferred from the UPA to any other candidate. We are with the UPA-Left on the issue of presidential polls.

 Asked if his party had suggested any name to the UPA, Singh, who holds the rural development portfolio, said the RJD would fully support any ABCD candidate from the UPA.

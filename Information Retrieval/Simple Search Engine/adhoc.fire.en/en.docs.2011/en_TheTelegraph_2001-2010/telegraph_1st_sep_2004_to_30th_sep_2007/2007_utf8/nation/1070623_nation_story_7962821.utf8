 Bangla army chief sets up India date

 Menon: A new beginning

 New Delhi, June 22: India and Bangladesh are poised to take a great leap forward in their relations with the Bangladesh army chief confirming plans to come calling in late August and foreign secretary Shiv Shanker Menon travelling to Dhaka next week. 

 Gen. Moeen U. Ahmed, the Bangladesh army chief and the power behind the caretaker government of Fakhruddin Ahmed, will be in New Delhi and Calcutta from August 22 to 26, government sources said.

 The confirmation of Moeens visit is a reflection of Delhis pragmatism vis--vis its key eastern neighbour, with whom it wants to end the bitterness of the recent past and break new ground.

 On his way to Dhaka, Menon is expected to touch down in Calcutta tomorrow and meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 Menon is also likely to meet the army chief in Dhaka, apart from caretaker President Ahmed, foreign adviser Iftikhar Chowdhury and his counterpart in the Bangladesh foreign office.

 Sources said Menon hopes to make a new beginning by excising old sores such as the matter of the enclaves that has been pending since 1971. Both sides had recently decided to carry out a joint survey.

 India and Bangladesh have over the last two months been exchanging information on militants who have slipped into each others country. A recent crackdown in Bengal and even in Calcutta on Bangladeshi fugitives has done much to boost confidence in Dhaka to unveil its own anti-Ufla swoop at home.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has often been quoted as saying that India will do business with whoever is in power and, although the statement was made in the context of Musharrafs Pakistan, government sources said it applied to Bangladesh, too.

 Foreign office officials have usually insisted that Bangladesh is not Pakistan, and that the people there are much more alive to democratic norms.

 This will be Moeens first visit to India. As a mukti joddha or freedom-fighter, he belongs to that elite and much-honoured group of Bangladeshis who participated in the struggle against Pakistan in 1971. Moeen will be received with full honours, both in India.

 The armys virtual takeover of Bangladesh had been viewed with some caution in Delhi when it occurred in January. But the armys tough stand on corruption and religious fundamentalism has brought much cheer in India.

 The arrest of Tarique Rahman, the son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has been a high point of the soft army rule in Bangladesh, as has been the hanging of six extremists like Bangla Bhai of the Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh group that had spread terror in the region. 

 Indias ambassador in Dhaka, Pinak Chakraborty, has been in close touch with the army chief, meeting him for the first time on the eve of foreign minister Pranab Mukherjees visit to Dhaka in February.

 It was here that the Sealdah-Joydebpur train service, pending for the last 15 years, was revived. Sources said the tracks are ready on the Bangladesh side and that Indian Railways is almost ready with its own upgradation.

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Truck driver son steers IAS feat 

 M. Kannappan drives a truck. Now, he can relax on the back seat as a chauffeur takes him and his son around.

 K. Nandakumar has secured the 30th rank in the civil services examination this year, the highest among candidates from Tamil Nadu. 

 Kannappan and his wife still cant believe it as congratulations pour into their little home in Tiruchi. Their IAS son is almost a celebrity. 

 Nandakumar, who took the UPSC exam in Tamil, had cleared the test last year in his second attempt. Earlier, the engineering graduate had quit his job in a private company to concentrate on his civil service quest.

 During his third attempt in 2006, he was undergoing training at Vadodara as an Indian Railway Traffic Service officer. The railways loss is the IASs gain. And who could have expressed that better than Ashish Vachhani, the Tiruchirappalli collector.

 The bureaucrat called on Nandakumars parents at their home to congratulate them for their sons achievement.

 YSR to open media front

 As the channel war hots up in Tamil Nadu, Y.S.R. Reddy realises he, too, must have a media arm.

 And, like his mega road and irrigation projects, the Andhra Pradesh chief minister wants the media foray by his family and friends to be a big one. 

 On the cards are multi-edition newspapers and channels that could require an investment of Rs 300 crore. 

 His son Jaganmohan Reddy had been looking to set up a Telugu news and entertainment channel under the Indira TV banner, but the plans were shelved. 

 The plans are being revived at a time when the chief minister is under attack from some media groups, which have been critical of the state government on several issues of public concern.

 Tax hit on US envoys

 The Karnataka government has done something the ministry of external affairs would be gleeful about. 

 The state has removed all tax concessions given to American diplomats. These include exemptions on lodging charges and opening a branch office in a star hotel. Even reimbursement of sales tax on purchases made in the state will not be allowed. 

 A tax of 12 per cent will be imposed on room rents and 20 per cent on facilities like health club, beauty parlour, business centre and swimming pool.

 lso, only US diplomats are being taxed while those from other countries and the UN continue to enjoy the exemptions. A bureaucrat who steered the move to withdraw the privileges said: When the US does not offer sops to visiting Indian diplomats, why should we? 

 Harsh lessons

 Teachers in Andhra Pradesh schools are getting tough lessons for the poor performance of students. 

 After headmasters faced the heat over dismal scores in board exams, the sword hangs over teachers whose pupils have failed to secure pass marks in their specific subjects.

 The education department has ordered the suspension of 2,600 teachers who handle English, mathematics and social sciences. 

 A record 13,000 schools have been told to pull up their socks by next year. School education minister D. Raja Narasimha says the licences of private schools whose students fared poorly because of infrastructure problems will be cancelled. He was mum on government schools that were just as bad.

 Delhi: Take a break from back- to-back meetings and squeeze out some time to tickle your taste buds. Head for lunch at The Park on May 29 to sample Goan delights such as vindaloo, xacuti, balchao and much more. 

 Time: 12.30 pm to 3 pm.

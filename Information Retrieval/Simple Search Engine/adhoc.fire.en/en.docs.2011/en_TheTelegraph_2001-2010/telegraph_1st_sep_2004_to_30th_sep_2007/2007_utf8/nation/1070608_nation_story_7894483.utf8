 (Top) Harindra, Aqeel: What next? 

 Mumbai, June 7: Percept Holdings MD Harindra Singh who followed DJ Aqeel to detention in Dubai last night for allegedly possessing drugs continues to be in police custody.

 Harindra and two of his colleagues from Percept one based in Mumbai and the other in West Asia have tested positive for drug abuse and may face a jail term. They were reportedly held with the banned drug, Ecstasy. 

 Harindra, in his 40s, will be in detention till he is produced in court. Tomorrow being a Friday, courts in Dubai are closed. Whatever happens will happen on Monday. His younger brother, Shailendra (joint MD of Percept), is with him, said a company source.

 Officially, the company remained tight-lipped, but sources said Shailendra is busy fielding top lawyers for his brother. 

 DJ Aqeel, who was also allegedly caught with Ecstasy at Dubai airport, is on the verge of getting bail but has decided not to pursue it, a family source said.

 Aqeel would have had to return to India if released and would have been deported to face charges in Mumbai. He is not comfortable with that. He hopes to return after getting his name cleared, said the source.

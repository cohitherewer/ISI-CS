 Furore over nuke letters

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 4: The Left and the BJP today jointly sought an explanation from the government on the American lawmakers letters pressing India to back off from its engagement with Iran to save the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 The angry reactions forced parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi to assure the Rajya Sabha that the government would not compromise national interest and sovereignty at any cost. 

 He also said he would convey their sentiments to the Prime Minister. I am sure he will make a statement.

 In letters to Manmohan Singh, a group of influential US lawmakers warned that Indias strengthening relationship with Iran would be taken into consideration when the US Congress votes on the final text of the 123 agreement.

 As soon as the House met, BJP member Yashwant Sinha, CPMs Brinda Karat and Janata Dal (United) member Digvijay Singh demanded suspension of the question hour to discuss the issue and sought an explanation from the Prime Minister.

 They termed the letter an open threat to Indias sovereignty and interference in the countrys internal affairs.

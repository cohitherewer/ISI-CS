 Eye on babu bungalows

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: Babus and their political masters who overstay in official accommodation could end up in jail if the Supreme Court has its way, reports our legal correspondent.

 A bench headed by Justice B.N. Aggarwal today asked the Centre if Section 441 of the Indian Penal Code, which defines criminal trespass, should be amended to make this a non-bailable offence.

 The court wants occupants who do not vacate their bungalows by the specified date to be arrested as criminal trespassers.

 Overstaying in official accommodation is not an offence now. Since the process of eviction or recovery of penal rents is long and tortuous, many public servants cling to the houses often bungalows in upscale neighbourhoods.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Hint of Escorts truce

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, May 24: The six-day standoff between cardiac surgeon Naresh Trehan and the Fortis Healthcare management abated tonight with sources indicating that the two sides were working on an out-of-court deal.

 While senior Fortis officials said they had no information, the sources told The Telegraph that both sides had agreed to maintain status quo while they were engaged in talks.

 In other words, the sources said, Trehan has been reinstated at Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre.

 Fortis officials said they could not confirm this. All we can say is that there is a dialogue under way, they said. Trehan was not available for comment.

 The hospital sources claimed that a statement is being prepared that would essentially say both sides regret the accusations made in the last few days and while talks proceed, status quo would be maintained.

 Accordingly, Trehan and other staff members who had been asked to leave were allowed to enter and handle their normal duties today.

 Fortis had last Friday asked Trehan to relinquish his position as the executive director of Escorts on the ground that his involvement with another healthcare facility was tantamount to conflict of interest.

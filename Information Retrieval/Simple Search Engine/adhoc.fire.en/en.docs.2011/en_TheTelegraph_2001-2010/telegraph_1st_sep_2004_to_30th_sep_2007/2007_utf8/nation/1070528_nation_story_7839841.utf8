 Tongue cut for husband

 Lucknow, May 27: A woman chopped off her tongue and offered it at Varanasis Kashi Vishwanath temple today in the hope that this would help trace her missing husband.

 Shaila Bai, 50, a resident of Faridnagar in Chhattisgarh, had come to Varanasi with her husband on May 23 to take a holy dip in the Ganga and offer prayers at the temple. But her husband went missing from a ghat, police said.

 When Shaila Bai failed to trace him, she decided to make a sacrifice to God. Eyewitnesses said she cut off her tongue with a razor.

 We are trying to find out how a woman could enter the temple with a razor, a police officer said. But he added that some eyewitnesses said the woman fell down and bit off her tongue.

 Suicide warrant against Ilyasi

 Suhaib Ilyasi

 New Delhi, April 2: Tightening the noose around television serial maker Suhaib Ilyasi, a Delhi court today issued a non-bailable warrant against the producer accused of having precipitated his wife Anjus alleged suicide in 2000.

 Best known for producing the trend-setting crime show Indias Most Wanted, which spawned a number of similar competing shows in its wake, Ilyasi is accused of having tortured his wife physically and mentally for dowry, leading to her suicide.

 Additional sessions judge Praveen Kumar, at Delhis Karkardooma courts, asked police to ensure Ilyasi was present on April 30 at the next hearing in the case.

 Ilyasi, arrested two months after Anjus death, had been granted bail in June 2000 on the condition that he regularly appear before the court at hearings. The judge, however, noted that Ilyasi, absent from the court today, had made a habit of not appearing before the court on one pretext or the other.

 Anju died of knife wounds to her abdomen on January 11, 2000. Ilyasi, who took her to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences where she was declared dead has claimed his wife stabbed herself.

 According to Ilyasis testimony, his wife also had a revolver in her possession, which she was about to use on herself, when he managed to grab it from her.

 Three diaries written by Anju were handed over to the police by her sister Rashmi Singh, who has alleged that Ilyasi murdered her sister.

 According to the police, the diaries document the torture Anju allegedly suffered at the hands of Ilyasi and his family over dowry.

 The police, however, did not charge Ilyasi with murder. Instead, he has been booked under Sections 304(b) (dowry death), 498(a) (subjecting a woman to cruelty) and 306 (abetting suicide) of the Indian Penal Code.

 Rashmi, in her statement in court, has alleged Ilyasi had started demanding dowry soon after he married Anju.

 Her body bore marks of his torture, her statement says.

 It goes on to list what she calls inconsistencies in Ilyasis statement. If he managed to grab the revolver from her, how come he failed to do the same with the knife? Rashmi questions in her statement.

 Ilyasi, in turn, has accused Rashmi of hurling the allegations with the objective of winning a custody battle for his daughter Aaliya following Anjus death. Delhi High Court in 2001 ruled in favour of Ilyasi in the custody battle.

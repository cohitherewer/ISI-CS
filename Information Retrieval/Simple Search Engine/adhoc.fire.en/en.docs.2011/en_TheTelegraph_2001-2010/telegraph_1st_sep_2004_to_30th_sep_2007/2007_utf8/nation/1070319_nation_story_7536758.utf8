 Wheel jam holds up Rajdhani

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 18: The Sealdah-bound Rajdhani Express from New Delhi was held up at Dadri station near Aligarh for several hours today after the wheels of one of its bogies got jammed.

 The snag was detected by a technician at Dadri station when he saw smoke coming out of the third bogie from the end at 5.51 pm. The technician alerted the staff and the electric circuit of the train was switched off.

 A spokesperson for the North Central Railway said from Allahabad that the fault was rectified within 10 minutes. But the train was held up as the wheels of the bogie had heated up.

 The official said the wheels got jammed because one of the brake blocks obstructed their movement. As a result, they started skidding on the tracks.

 There was no casualty as the fault was detected and rectified in time. The official said there was no fire on the train.

 The train will be put on the main line for its onward journey to Sealdah after clearance from the technical staff. The official said the train would be released once the wheels attained normal temperature.

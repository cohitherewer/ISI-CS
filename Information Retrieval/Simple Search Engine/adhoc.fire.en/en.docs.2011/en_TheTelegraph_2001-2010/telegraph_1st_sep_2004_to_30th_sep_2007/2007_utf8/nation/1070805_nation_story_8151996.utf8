 VIPs prone to falling ill in jail

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 4: Celebrity prisoners are more likely to actually suffer physical illness than other inmates, medical experts have said, contradicting perceptions that VIP prisoners tend to feign sickness. 

 A combination of psychosomatic and biological factors contributes to conditions that can range from mild infection and exacerbation of existing medical problems to high blood pressure and heart-related problems, doctors said. 

 Although it is sometimes difficult to pinpoint precise triggers, the experts believe, the physical illness may result from intense stress, the abrupt exposure to an altered environment as well as from changes in food and water. 

 High stress associated with loss of image in VIPs may lead to physical illness, said Sunil Mittal, a psychiatrist at the Delhi Psychiatry Centre. The stress may exacerbate conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure. 

 The change in the level of comfort that usually accompanies a stay in jail may also contribute to illness. One doctor who has worked with prisoners in New Delhi recalls how once a power outage prompted a VIP prisoner to go almost hysterical. The fan went out, and it was really hot... the prisoner started to shout, saying he couldnt stand the heat and that he was going to die, the doctor said. 

 Doctors say that while long-term stress can also lower immunity as well as cause sleep problems, the altered standards of hygiene in the food and water available in prison may also lead to infection. 

 Prisoners from upper socio-economic classes actually do fall ill... theyre not feigning as it is sometimes thought, said Rajat Mitra, a consultant psychiatrist who has worked with prisoners in Tihar Jail for several years. 

 The discomfort is easier to bear if the ordeal is viewed as justified, said Mittal. In other words, a convict who believes that he or she did not deserve a sentence is likely to have higher stress levels than an inmate who has accepted a level of guilt. 

 Remember our freedom fighters who tolerated long periods in jail with great fortitude. They believed the cause justified their ordeal, Mittal said. 

 The first studies linking prisons and ill health are decades old. One study by researchers at the Yale University School of Medicine in the early 1980s suggested that crowding in prisons could lead to high blood pressure. 

 However, the study added that crowding was more than just restrictions on physical space. Even a perceived discrepancy in the amount of space an individual requires and the amount of space that is available can lead to a sense of crowding. 

 However, medical studies have also suggested that prisoners in general tend to have poorer physical, mental and social health than the population at large.

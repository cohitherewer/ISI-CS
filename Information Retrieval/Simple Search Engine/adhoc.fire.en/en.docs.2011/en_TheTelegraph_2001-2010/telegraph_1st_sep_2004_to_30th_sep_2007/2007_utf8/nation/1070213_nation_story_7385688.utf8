 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 12: A 28-year-old British tourist was allegedly raped by her Polish friend in a central Delhi hotel last Wednesday, police said today.

 According to the police, the British woman had been staying at a hotel in Paharganj a favourite destination for low-income backpackers for two weeks before the incident.

 We believe it was a case of date rape only on this occasion, it involved two foreigners, deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Anand Mohan said.

 The alleged rapist, Dominique Rafael, apparently slipped a pill of a sleep-inducing drug into the victims drink at a Connaught Place nightclub the two visited on Wednesday night.

 Rafael then brought the woman back to his hotel adjacent to hers where he is believed to have raped her while she was semi-conscious.

 The girl complained the next day to New Delhi Railway Station police post. Rafael was arrested a couple of hours later from his hotel room.

 Medical tests on the girl suggest forcible intercourse, Mohan said.

 The alleged rapist has been sent to judicial custody in Tihar jail.

 According to the police, the British high commission, which was contacted after the girl complained, got in touch with the victims family. The victim helped in the initial investigation, but has now left for Britain, a senior official said.

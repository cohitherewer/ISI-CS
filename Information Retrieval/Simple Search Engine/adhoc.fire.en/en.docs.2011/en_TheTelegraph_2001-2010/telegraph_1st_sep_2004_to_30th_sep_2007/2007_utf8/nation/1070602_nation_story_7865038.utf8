 PM education push

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 1: Each Indian state will have at least one central university and each district one degree college, according to an initiative taken by the Prime Minister.

 Manmohan Singh has asked the University Grants Commission and the Planning Commission to prepare a strategy to ensure that while the challenge of increasing enrolment is met, access to and quality of education is not compromised.

 Increasing the number of central universities and degree colleges was part of the strategy, said a source close to the Prime Minister.

 Singhs idea was that the central universities should become a benchmark for state counterparts. The government is also likely to increase the number of scholarships and freeships to induce enrolments in colleges.

 The announcement was made after a meeting Singh held with human resource development minister Arjun Singh, finance minister P. Chidambaram and Planning Commission deputy chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia.

 At present, there are 19 central universities but their geographical spread is uneven. Delhi and Uttar Pradesh have four and five, respectively. Barring Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh, the other north-eastern states have one or more such universities.

 In the west, Maharashtra is the sole beneficiary, while the southern states have just two. Bengal has the Visva-Bharati University.

 The states likely to get priority are Gujarat, Bihar, Orissa, Tamil Nadu and Jammu and Kashmir.

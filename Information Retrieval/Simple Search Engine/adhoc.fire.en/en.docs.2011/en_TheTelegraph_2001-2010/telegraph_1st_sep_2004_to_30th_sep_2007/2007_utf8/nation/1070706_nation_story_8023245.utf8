 Buddha date with Singapore realty titan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 5: The chief executive of Singapores largest real estate company will hold talks with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee tomorrow on a string of hotel projects.

 Philip Ng, who heads the $15-billion Far East Organisation, has teamed up with the Wellside Group to invest Rs 800 crore in a variety of hotel projects. It has applied for land in Rajarhat to set up one such address. That project, worth about Rs 200 crore, is expected to be the focus of the talks between Bhattacharjee and Philip. 

 Money for the hotel ventures will also come from Starwood Capital Group Global LLC, part of the USs Starwood Group. Other than the Rajarhat centre, the Far East-Wellside combine plans a luxury destination in the hills and a chain of smart hotels in smaller cities.

 We are looking at a combination of properties. About 60 per cent of the investment would be ours. The share of Far East and Starwood Capital will be decided later, Wellside chairman Aditya Poddar said. His group is also converting Lady Ranu Mukherjees Ho Chi Minh Sarani house into a boutique-heritage hotel.

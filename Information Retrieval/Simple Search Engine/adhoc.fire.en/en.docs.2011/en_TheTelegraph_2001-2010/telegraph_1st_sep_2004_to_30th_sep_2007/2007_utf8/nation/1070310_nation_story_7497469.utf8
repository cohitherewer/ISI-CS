 Arjun plays safe on quota

 New Delhi, March 9: Arjun Singh is usually proactive when it comes to announcing policy decisions on minorities and weaker sections. Today, he was unusually guarded.

 At a news conference, the human resource development minister said: I do not think Muslims should claim reservation only in the Dalit category. That has a different background and philosophy.

 He also said it was not the HRD ministrys mandate to have a new caste-based commission. The decision to have a caste-based commission has to be taken by the government. The HRD ministry cannot take such a decision.

 Earlier this week, the Supreme Court had observed that the government had rushed the 27 per cent OBC quota bill. It also added that a new caste-based census was needed to decide the quantum of quota since the last caste census was done as early as 1931.

 Arjun made it clear that a decision on a second caste commission could only be taken by the UPA government and not by individual ministries.

 Political observers believe Arjuns news conference was meant to signal that he was around and intended to stay that way and also continue as HRD minister. His continued absence for over two months from his ministry and cabinet meetings was grist to the Congresss rumour mill.

 There was speculation on how Arjun may go the way of Murasoli Maran, who was re-designated as minister without portfolio in the NDA regime when he became too ill and unfit to function as minister or be appointed as governor. Arjuns name was mentioned as a prospective presidential candidate along with that of former Uttarakhand chief minister N.D. Tiwari. The HRD minister was reportedly upset with such stories.

 Arjun attempted to scotch the rumours, at least partially, by announcing he would attend Parliament from Monday. Asked if he was looking at being a presidential candidate, he replied: Thats for the leadership to decide.

 Arjun spoke only on education. He seemed confident the 11th five year plan would increase budgetary allocation from 3.8 to 6 per cent of the GDP.

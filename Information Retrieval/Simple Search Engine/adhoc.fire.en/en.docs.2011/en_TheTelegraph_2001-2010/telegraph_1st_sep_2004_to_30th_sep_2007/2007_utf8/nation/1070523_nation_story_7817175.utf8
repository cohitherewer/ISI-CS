 Life term for cop 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 22: A policeman was today sentenced to life in jail for abetting terror in the 1993 Bombay blasts, marking a first in judicial history.

 V.K. Patil was sentenced to life imprisonment for letting a truck loaded with arms head to Mumbai after intercepting it in a surprise raid on January 9, 1993. 

 Patil, then posted as sub-inspector at Srivardhan police station in Raigad, took a bribe of Rs 7 lakh to let the truck pass through.

 Judge Pramod Kode said Patil did not deserve any leniency as he had misused and abused his official position. 

 In an order laced with sarcasm, the court said Patil and his team had showed high courage on part of the public servant for special personal gains.

 The court sentenced Patel on twin charges of criminal conspiracy and aiding and abetting the terror act masterminded by Dawood Ibrahim. It directed him to pay a fine of Rs 1 lakh for each of the two counts. Both life sentences will run concurrently. 

 Five others were sentenced to six years rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs 15,000 each for undergoing arms training in Pakistan. A sixth person convicted of the same charge was given seven years in jail and a fine of Rs 15,000.

 Pratibha fake on Net

 Pratibha meets Congress MLAs in Delhi. (PTI)

 Namaste! I am The Nominee of the United Progressive Alliance for the Honourable post of The President of The Republic of India. Wish me Good Luck. I am more than certain of becoming the First Citizen. Please Visit my Profile to know more about me. Thank You my dear Citizens.

 Any guesses who this is?

 Pratibha Patil, obviously. Its her appeal to her countrymen on Orkut.

 Wrong.

 The UPA nominee may have a complete profile and a community dedicated to her on the popular networking website but its fake.

 It makes interesting reading, though.

 A.P.J. Abdul Kalams likely successor has triggered a furious debate among members of the community on the credibility of her nomination.

 The community, which has 88 members, says it was the first to propose Patils name for the presidential chair and is part of the India Need(s) A Woman President Campaign.

 But not all members share the same enthusiasm as the creator of the community, Zameer Human, a 27-year-old medical student from Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh.

 Woman president Prathiba PatilWho is she??? A congress loyalist thats all we know.... says Kaiser Arijit, a chartered accountant from Chennai.

 Others whom the community members would like as President are Kalam, Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi. 

 The profile doesnt leave anything to the imagination. This is what she has to say about herself in the about me section: I Established the Pratibha Mahila Sahakari Bank at Jalgaon, Maharashtra; Was Founder President till its dissolution while her ideal date will be the day she receives the guard of honour from the presidential bodyguards.

 She criticises former NDA minister Arun Shouries articles for exposing my fraud in a cooperative bank which lends poor womens money to my relatives (They are actually men but I treated them as women for the purpose).

 And the five things she cant live without? The answer is: her veil, her husband, Sonia, power and wealth.

 Congress spokesperson Jayanti Natrajan, Patils campaign manager, dismissed the website as stupid.

 UK online visa plea on hold

 London, May 19 (PTI): Britain has suspended its online visa application facility in India after personal data of thousands of Indians were compromised, prompting the UK government to order a probe.

 As many as 4,70,000 Indians had applied for visas to Britain last year, around 50,000 of them online.

 According to a report telecast by Britains Channel 4, the online process had a security lapse, which made personal details of the applicants freely available.

 The Opposition Conservative Party said the security breach was open to being exploited by terrorists. Shadow immigration minister Damian Green said: This may have been a treasure trove for international terrorists.

 The British information commissioner, the governments data privacy watchdog, is probing the lapse, an official said today. The commissioner has demanded a full explanation from the foreign office.

 Visa processing in India was contracted out by the foreign office to a private Indian company, VFS Global.

 Britain has also suspended the facility in Russia and Nigeria because VFS provides the service in those countries, too, the official said.

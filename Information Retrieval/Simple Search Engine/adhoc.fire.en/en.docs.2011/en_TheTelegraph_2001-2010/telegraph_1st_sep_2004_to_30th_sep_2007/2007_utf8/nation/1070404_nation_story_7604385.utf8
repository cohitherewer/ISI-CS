 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Curry favour for Telengana state

 The campaign for Telenganas statehood has taken an entertaining turn. Dance, folklore, music shows and curry carnivals are now spicing up the quest.

 At the recent Telengana Sambaralu festival he organised, Telengana Rashtra Samiti leader K. Chandrasekhar Rao threw in all possible elements of amusement. 

 This isnt a campaign for Telengana state alone, but for the renaissance of Telengana culture, Rao declared.

 Politics and myriad caste differences melted in the lip-smacking fare put on the table jowar roti, baigan-ka-bartha, pickles and some meaty delights. The feast on five varieties of chicken curry and gosht (meat) preparations is a pleasant surprise, Madhu Yaski Goud, Congress MP from Nizamabad, said between helpings.

 I am glad such events are organised since they help us sink our differences. At least, we share meals and music, said Bandaru Dattatreya, the Andhra Pradesh BJP president. He had organised a similar feast last year.

 God bless the budget

 Though reforms have robbed budgets of their surprise, their presentation is still a serious and sombre affair.

 In Tamil Nadu, where the DMK makes no bones about its agnosticism, the presentation is preceded by one of saint-poet Thiruvalluvars many couplets. 

 Usually, its left to the Speaker to recite the lines.

 Last week, there was a break from the routine, though. From the dull brown covers containing finance minister K. Anbazhagans speech, popped out a surprise of sorts a yellow glossy with a photo of an old temple on the cover. 

 The 96-page book was titled Project For Heritage Conservation of Ancient Temples in Tamil Nadu.

 Normally, one would have expected such tomes to be handed out when grants for religious institutions are debated in the Assembly. But Karunanidhis government apparently wanted to give this years budget a more auspicious start than Thiruvalluvars poems.

 Malls of change

 The mall mania sweeping big-city India isnt about designer labels alone. 

 Next weekend, an event in Delhi organised by retail bigwigs will attempt to show how super-marts are changing the way items of everyday use are sold.

 The India Expo Centre and Marts four-day business-to-business exhibition opening on April 15 will showcase products used at home. One of its many objectives is to project Indian handicrafts and their relevance, the organisers said.

 With the theme home beyond, the event will display a range of handicrafts, including lifestyle products. These are items that now reach overseas buyers mostly through global giants such as Wal-Mart. 

 By opening up new distribution channels, the exhibition aims to help change the way these items are sold. 

 Light gallery

 The Nehru Science Centres new light-and-sight gallery opened last week. 

 Said to be a nature lovers delight, the gallery showcases various features of light and vision. Visitors can watch a bewildering array of light produced by manipulation of lenses, mirrors and prisms.

 It also offers an insight into the basics of vision persistence of vision, blindness and how people see moving bodies.

 The illusion section has breathtaking deceptions playing out. Multimedia terminals have been set up for more information. 

 The centre, a unit of the National Council of Science Museums, is one of the largest of its kind in India. Around 2,000 visitors troop in each day, administrator C.K. Das said.

 Delhi: If you are ready for a laugh at yourself, dont miss the Asian Cartoon Exhibition at the Japan Foundation 5A, Lajpat Nagar till April 5. Works of Asias finest cartoonists, reflecting on our societies, will be on show. Time: 11 am to 6 pm.

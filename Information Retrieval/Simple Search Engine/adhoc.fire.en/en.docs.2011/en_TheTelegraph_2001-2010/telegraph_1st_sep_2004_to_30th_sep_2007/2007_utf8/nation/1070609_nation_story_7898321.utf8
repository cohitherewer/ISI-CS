 Options on Singur table 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 8: Several options are on the CPM table as the party tries to make up its mind on the Singur land-for-land deal.

 The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation has not yet allotted land for ancillary units, though it has received around 70 applications.

 A section of the party and allies wants the government to consider whether a part of this land could be given to the unwilling farmers in Singur.

 But CPM leaders like Benoy Konar feel that the low-lying land between the Tata Motors site and the Durgapur Expressway under the PWD might be a better option.

 It is not possible to offer land by redrawing the Tata factory site. Neither is it possible to divide the mother plant and ancillary industries. It will affect the project badly and the Tatas would leave, Konar said.

 Another suggestion came from the land reforms commissioner, P.K. Agarwal. He said the government could buy plots under a scheme called land and homestead for landless people. Agarwal said Rs 1.9 crore of the fund is lying unused.

 The Trinamul Congress feels that the ancillary units could easily be shifted to huge tracts of low and marshy land opposite the project site.

 In the event of a political decision to return acquired land there is no provision in law to do so officials said a Supreme Court order offered a way out.

 The apex court has said land not required should be auctioned off. We can return the land to unwilling farmers while recording it as an auction in our records, an official said.

 The CPM leadership has censured land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah for suggesting that a way could be found around the legal bar.

 Cuba ahoy

 After announcing a countrywide protest from June 22, Mamata Banerjee has set sights on communist Cuba. Some of our representatives will visit Cuba. I have asked them to take two farmland activists along and see what is happening there in agriculture, she said.

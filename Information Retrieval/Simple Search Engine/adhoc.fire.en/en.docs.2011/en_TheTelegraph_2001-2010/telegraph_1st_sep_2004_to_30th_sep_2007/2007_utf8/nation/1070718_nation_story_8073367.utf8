 Pandits want home, not colony

 Srinagar, July 17: Kashmirs displaced Pandits are angry.

 New satellite towns are coming up outside the Valley, but the Pandits forced out of their homes by militants dont want such safe zones. They want to go back to the land where they once lived, not a second migration.

 Two days after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh laid the foundation stone of a township for migrants in Jammu, the Pandits are up in arms against what they say is the governments bid to put hurdles in the path of their return.

 Why this township in Jammu? fumed Ratan Lal Bhan, the president of the All India Kashmiri Hindu Forum. We want such safe zones in Kashmir where our Muslim brothers are willing to lend us support.

 Bhan says such colonies should come up in areas like Indira Nagar and Shiv Pora in Kashmir where the Pandits once had a sizeable population. This is how they (the government) could have facilitated our return, he said.

 Singh had on Sunday kicked off a Rs 221.54-crore project to build some 4,000 two-room flats at Jagti in the Nagrota area of Jammu where around 85 acres have been identified for the township.

 Before this initiative, various plans for the return of the Pandits had failed to take off. 

 In 2003, Kashmirs ruling coalition had decided to build a colony for the Pandits at Sheikhpora in Budgam. Colonies at other places across the state were to follow.

 Out of 206 flats at Sheikhpora, 96 are complete and work on the rest is on, Budgam deputy commissioner Farooq Renzu said.

 Official sources said the other flats would take at least one more year to be completed. The government has received thousands of applications from the Pandits aspiring to return. But no decision has been taken about when the process of their return will begin, an officer said.

 The Pandits say the government is going slow on their return and pushing them to distant areas in Jammu. 

 We are being shifted to Jagti, which is 25km away, and it is like a second migration for us. The government should have, instead, improved the facilities in our camp, said Som Nath, the president of the Muthi Camp Displaced Welfare Committee.

 After militancy started in the late eighties, over 56,000 Kashmiri Pandit families migrated to Jammu and other places. Of them, some 34,000 families live in Jammu, 19,000 in Delhi and around 2,000 elsewhere in the country.

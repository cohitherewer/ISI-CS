 Vaghela diagnosis: lazy farmers court death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Vaghela: Tips from Gujarat 

 Sept. 9: Maharashtras cotton farmers are lazy, the Union textile minister said today, appearing to suggest this was why they faced mounting debts and were committing suicide.

 Shankersinh Vaghela said Maharashtras farmers would do well to learn from those in his home state, Gujarat.

 There are power cuts in both Gujarat and Maharashtra. The farmers in Gujarat, just like the farmers here, chew tobacco. But after (having finished) chewing tobacco, the farmers in Gujarat go to work whereas the farmers here sit idly, Vaghela told a cotton farmers conference in Akola.

 What can the government do in all this? You must try and emulate the farmers of Gujarat. Come there and see for yourself.

 Farmers bodies accused the minister of trying to deflect blame for the suicide spree in Vidarbha, where 5,000 farmers are alleged to have killed themselves since 2005.

 The government wants to say that it is the farmers own fault and that they should change their habits. They want to project all government policies as correct and pro-farmer, said Kishor Tiwari, the chief of the Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti.

 But it is a fact that cotton farmers have fallen victim to free trade and the introduction of high-cost, high-risk cotton cultivation. How else can they explain 5,000 suicides in 32 months? Tiwari asked.

 We urge the government to protect the 3 million cotton farmers of Vidarbha by providing them proper credit and cost protection.

 In July 2006, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had sanctioned Rs 3,750 crore to curb farmer suicides in the state. But 1,500 committed suicide between then and May this year.

 A recent government survey of 17 lakh farmer families across 8,531 Vidarbha villages found that 75 per cent of them were in distress. More than a fourth 4.34 lakh were in acute distress and, therefore, were more suicide-prone, the survey said.

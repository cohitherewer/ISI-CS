 The Buzz in Big Cities 

 Trim that tummy, win the flab fight

 New Delhi: Tired of tummy tucks not working, try a tummy cut instead. Dr Pradeep Chowbey has just helped a Hyderabad family cut their weight problems to size and, as a bonus, squeeze their ballooning food bill, too.

 Chowbey completed whats known in medical science as bariatric surgery, in which the stomach volume is reduced. A person who undergoes this procedure feels full after eating only a third of the usual food portion. It also leads to a loss of 2 kg a week over several months after the surgery.

 The husband heaviest at 117 kg his wife and his brother, all in their 30s, went under Chowbeys scalpel. We divide the stomach into two portions, said Chowbey, a surgeon at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and president of the Obesity Surgery Society of India. Morbid obesity may result from body metabolism or binge eating, or both.

 The surgery also helped a Punjab boy who had six meals a day, a snack at night before sleeping and a snack at daybreak. The number of bariatric procedures in India is steadily growing. Its time obesity is seen as a disease, and not only a cosmetic problem, says Chowbey.

 Listen to bhajan, keep faith

 Hyderabad: Pied Piper might have liked this. Tirumalas Balaji temple will use a part of its overflowing coffers to tackle a problem outside its gates conversions.

 More than Rs 100 crore will be spent over two years organising bhajan mandals (choirs for devotional songs) in 40,000 Andhra temples, and others in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The aim is to spread Hinduism and check conversions. The Tirumala Tirupati Dewasthanam (TTD), which runs the shrine, plans to hand out cash, religious literature and song booklets to each mandal. We will fund any number of mandals anywhere. But we are looking at the three southern states, TTD chairman B. Karunakar Reddy said. In Visakhapatnam, the TTD helped set up 1,500 such mandals under an NGO. The response has been good. 

 Schindlers star glow

 Mumbai: Richard Gere comes here often, but his trips are little more than stopovers as he chats up pretty women in fleeting appearances at anti-AIDS campaigns. British actor Ralph Fiennes, best known for his roles in Schindlers List, The English Patient and Hamlet on the Broadway, isnt a frequent flier to Mumbai, but has been packing in much more during his visit.

 Fiennes, UKs ambassador to Unicef, is spreading awareness about the spread of HIV-AIDS among children. The handsome actor, in the running to be the new James Bond until Daniel Craig outgunned him, spent nearly a week understanding Bollywood. Last week, Fiennes was at the shooting of a promo for Munnabhai Chala Amrika, the next Munnabhai sequel. The promos will be shown during the screening of Eklavya. Vidhu Vinod Chopra has produced both films.

 Sai effect

 Chennai: Sathya Sai Babas recent visit to the city has prised open hospital cash-vaults for the needy. The inspiration has come from Sathya Sai Trusts hospitals in Puttaparthi in Andhra and at Whitefield, near Bangalore, that offer free treatment to thousands of patients, many of whom dont pay even for major surgeries.

 In Chennai, 55 private hospitals and eight premier diagnostic labs have promised Sai Baba they will provide at least a bed each for the poor. Treatment will be free of cost, irrespective of the ailment or the expenses. The big names include M.V. Diabetes Centre, Kanchi Kamakoti Child Trust Hospital and Shankar Nethralaya.

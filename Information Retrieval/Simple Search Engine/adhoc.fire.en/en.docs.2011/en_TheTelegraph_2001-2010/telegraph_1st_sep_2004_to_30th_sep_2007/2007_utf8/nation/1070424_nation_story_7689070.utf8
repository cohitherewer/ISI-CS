 Time not ripe to snap UPA ties: Basu

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 23: Jyoti Basu is opposed to the idea of withdrawing the Lefts support to the Centre right now.

 His stand is different from a section of the CPM leadership and allies CPI, RSP and the Forward Bloc, which have threatened to sever ties with the Congress-led UPA government.

 Some people want to withdraw support now. But, in my opinion, the time is not ripe to snap ties. Its true the Congress is not abiding by the UPAs common minimum programme despite our protests. But we have to be patient and mount pressure on the Congress, Basu said at a convention of unions and employee organisations.

 Having opposed the Congress for 45 years, the Left has to shore up a coalition led by it at the Centre because the BJP has to be kept at bay, the CPM patriarch said.

 Last week, Peoples Democracy, the CPM mouthpiece, had dropped veiled threats about pulling the plug, saying the Congress couldnt take the Lefts support for granted by posing the threat of the BJP.

 Recent victories of the BJP-led NDA in Uttarakhand and Punjab as well as in the civic elections in Mumbai and Delhi have also prompted the Left to review its ties with the Congress. 

 The CPI wants the support to be made critical and based on issues. The RSP and the Forward Bloc believe its time to become equidistant from the BJP and the Congress while charting an independent third course. 

 But some are echoing Basus sentiment. Political equations will change after the Uttar Pradesh polls. The coordination committee of the four Left parties will finalise Left-UPA relations only after the polls are over in May, Forward Bloc secretary Debabrata Biswas said.

 Oath row in court

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, May 22: The Supreme Court will decide whether legislators can take the oath of office in the name of Allah.

 In July, it will hear a petition challenging the right of 11 Kerala MLAs to attend the House. They had taken their oaths in the name of Allah.

 According to the Constitution, an MLA can swear in the name of God or solemnly affirm that he will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution.

 In the petition, the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morchas Madhu Parumala has argued that an oath in the name of Allah is unconstitutional, and that MLAs who did so should be penalised.

 Article 193 of the Constitution lays down a fine of Rs 500 a day for legislators who take part in House proceedings without taking oath under the format set out in the Third Schedule, Parumala said.

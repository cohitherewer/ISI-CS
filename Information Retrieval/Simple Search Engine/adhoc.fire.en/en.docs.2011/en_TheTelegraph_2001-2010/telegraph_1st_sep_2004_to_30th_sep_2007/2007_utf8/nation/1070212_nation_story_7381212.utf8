 IT braces for bandh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Feb. 11: Bangalores IT industry will shut down for the second time in a year when Cauvery protesters bring the silicon capital to a halt tomorrow.

 Along with schools, shops and offices, the citys 1,400 infotech firms will stay closed, preferring a longer weekend to the risk of violence.

 We dont want to be the target. We cannot ensure the security of our commuting employees. Its better to cut ones losses than take a beating, a leading IT companys vice-president said on the condition of anonymity.

 But BPOs, like always, have a plan B. They will be transferring some of the inbound and outbound calls to other centres in Gurgaon, Pune and Chennai. Some executives will be asked to work 24-hour shifts with small breaks in between.

 Industry sources claimed a leading BPO working for a UK insurance firm had flown a dozen of its executives to its Pune office for two days to avoid bandh-related disruption.

 The last time the IT industry had closed down was in April last year during the riots that followed film icon Rajkumars death.

 Pro-Kannada sentiments lie behind both shutdowns, with protesters alleging that the Cauvery tribunals February 5 final award to Tamil Nadu smacks of bias.

 The dawn-to-dusk bandh had earlier been called on February 8 but was put off by four days, at the request of chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, keeping in mind the Aero India 2007 show last week.

 The state government has declared a holiday for schools, colleges and universities. Its own offices will be open but attendance is likely to be thin.

 About a 20,000-strong force will be on vigil in Bangalore. The multinationals have been told to tighten security within and without. We have rounded up about 1,100 (potential troublemakers), police commissioner N. Achyut Rao said.

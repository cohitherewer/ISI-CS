 Hospital rapped for holding on to body

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 12: Rapping a private hospital for refusing to hand over the body of a patient unless his family cleared the bills, Bombay High Court today directed it to file a reply in four weeks.

 It also ordered that the Medical Council of India be made a respondent to the petition to examine medical ethics.

 Madhusudan Nawar, 54, had been admitted to LH Hiranandani Hospital when he suffered a heart attack. After he died on Thursday, the hospital authorities did not let his family take the body for his last rites, saying they would have to clear the bills first, Madhusudans brother, Pramod, said in his petition. They had paid Rs 3,30,000 out of the Rs 7,82,000 due.

 The body has been lying in the morgue of the state-run JJ Hospital since.

 A division bench of Justices Ranjana Desai and Anoop Mohta today ordered JJ Hospital to immediately release the body. We are shocked. How can a hospital hold lien over a body, like some property, to recover money? 

 Larger issues have to be dealt with and guidelines have be framed to deal with situations like this, where treatment is required but patients do not have the funds. Can hospitals refuse patients who do not have money?

 Pramod also alleged medical negligence by the hospitals doctors. He pointed out that the post-mortem report dated February 10 did not mention any cause of death. 

 Taking note of that, the court directed the Maharashtra government to inquire into the matter and file a progress report. It said that as the issue involved medical ethics, the Medical Council of India should be given a notice and made a respondent.

 The hospital refused to give the Nawars even the medical papers of the patient. Nor did it allow the patient to be moved to another hospital, activist Subodh More who helped Pramod file the petition said. 

 It is really tragic. Today is Madhusudans birthday, and the family will be given his body. That, too, after a legal fight, More said.

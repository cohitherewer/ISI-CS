 In unravelling sari, a new Mahabharata 

 AMIT ROY 

 Natasha Jayetileke, who plays Draupadi, and writer Stephen Clark 

 London, April 26: Wednesday night was a big night for India when the world premiere of a new production of the Mahabharata was staged at Sadlers Wells in London. 

 Not since Peter Brooks nine-hour version in 1985 has there been such an ambitious adaptation of the epic. 

 The multicultural audience as well as the multicultural cast added to the sense of occasion, for everyone recognised that Sadlers Wells had undertaken a project of immense complexity. 

 Yards of red sari fluttered down from above to reflect the bloody battle scenes. When Duryodhana tries to strip Draupadi of her garments after winning the ultimate trophy in the game of dice, it seemed the buying department at Sadlers Wells had acquired all the white saris that could be acquired in India. The unravelling of Draupadis sari went on and on and on and on. 

 The writer, Stephen Clark, who read as much as he could of the original text in English translation, said doing the adaptation was a privilege. 

 He called the play a journey in truth. He had sought to inject an element of classical Greek drama having protagonists to give non-Indian audiences some familiar moorings. 

 Clarks previous assignment was very different he turned M.M. Kayes The Far Pavilions into a musical for the London stage. 

 He said that with his western audience in mind, he had to weave together some of the high moments of drama in the Mahabharata, including especially the disrobing of Draupadi (played by Natasha Jayetileke, a young British actress of Sri Lankan origin who had read English at Cambridge). 

 As to whether this version of the Mahabharata will tour India, Kenya-born businessman Kalapi Jani, who partly financed the project, told The Telegraph: We are working on it. 

 After a short London run, this dance musical will be taken on tour to Clwyd in Wales, Brighton, Manchester, Edinburgh, Oxford, Birmingham and Leicester. 

 A scene from the new dramatised version of Mahabharata.

So a new generation of Britons, among them British-born and -bred Indians, will be introduced for the first time to one of the cornerstones of Indian culture. But it is as well to recognise that, like Shakespeare, there is now no copyright on the Mahabharata the greatest Indian story ever told today belongs to the world. 

 Jani said: I wanted this Mahabharata to be authentic. But in two and a half hours, you cannot do the whole of the Mahabharata; for that you need 250 hours. But I hope people will want to go and read the whole text. 

 At least four of the dancers Dwaipayan Das, Sujit Karmakar, Sandip Mallick and Subrata Pandit were recruited from Calcutta. 

 Krishna is portrayed by Gary Pillai, a product of the Oxford School of Drama, while Marcos Jose James, a singer, dancer, actor and model originally from Jamaica, has been cast as Arjuna. 

 Sadlers Wells described its Mahabharata as a brand new piece of dance theatre and a contemporary vision of the epic ancient Indian poem. This powerful production features an international ensemble of 26 dancers, singers and musicians and a specially composed score by celebrated polymath Nitin Sawhney. 

 It said: The ensemble cast creates the story of the Mahabharata as seen through the eyes of Draupadi; a woman who defies her destiny to become wife to five brothers and who, lost in a game of dice, becomes the catalyst for the worlds most terrible war. 

 Directed by Stuart Wood and written by Olivier Award-winning lyricist Stephen Clark, the story inhabits a mythic world created through dance, song, spoken verse, Sanskrit prayer, chant and choric storytelling, reflecting the classic Indian tradition with a contemporary sensibility. 

 Wood said: It is more than 20 years since Peter Brooks seminal version of the Mahabharata. Its now time this extraordinary story can be seen again in a new light.

 Gauri Sharma Tripathi, a leading Kathak exponent and choreographer for the dancer Akram Khan, has created a new dance language for the piece, using a Kathak vocabulary seen through a contemporary dance perspective, Sadlers Wells explained. 

 This language is enriched through puppetry work created by Sue Buckmaster, artistic director of Theatre Rites. Mahabharata is a total theatrical experience bringing together dance, theatre, music and illusion. 

 It has to be said the story of the Mahabharata is not easy to follow for westerners unfamiliar with the Indian epic. Even British-born Indians will find it useful to have a brief summary of the plot and an introduction to the main characters. 

 Sadlers Wells does say: Originally written in more than 110,000 stanzas, the Mahabharata is considered the cornerstone of ancient Indian legend. The central story is a family feud between two groups of rival cousins, the five Pandavas and the hundred Kauravas. 

 The world premiere was put on without as much rehearsal as the artistic director, Alastair Spalding, would perhaps have liked.

 That it went on is not a minor miracle, its a major miracle, he joked.

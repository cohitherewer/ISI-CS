 Encounter cop gives in

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, July 1: A police inspector wanted in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter has surrendered, giving a shot in the arm to the CID that is probing the case.

 Balkrishna Chaube today surrendered in Gandhinagar. He was absconding since March when top Gujarat police official D.G. Vanzara and two IPS officers were arrested. 

 Chaube, who was with the anti-terrorist squad, appeared before the metropolitan court to surrender but it refused him judicial custody and asked him to come back tomorrow. 

 Accompanied by his advocate, Chaube then went to Gandhinagar to surrender before the CID where he was arrested. He will be produced in court tomorrow. 

 Chaube is a vital link in the case because he is believed to have been present from the time Sohrabuddin and his wife were picked up to their killing.

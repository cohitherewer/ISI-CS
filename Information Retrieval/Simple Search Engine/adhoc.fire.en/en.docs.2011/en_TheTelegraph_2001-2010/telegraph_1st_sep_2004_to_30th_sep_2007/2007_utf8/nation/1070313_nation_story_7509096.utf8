 Surf less, socialise more: IIT tells students

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 OUT OF BOUNDS?

 Mumbai, March 12: Starting tonight, students at the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, will have to forgo one of their pet pastimes: trawling the Net between 11 pm and 12.30 noon in hostel rooms.

 Addiction to surfing, gaming, downloading movies and music and blogging was affecting students performance, making them reclusive and even suicidal, authorities said.

 Many had stopped socialising and were late for morning classes or slept through them, they added.

 Now a student doesnt even know who lives two doors away from him because he is so busy on the Internet, Prakash Gopalan, dean of student affairs, said.

 The old hostel culture of camaraderie and socialising among students is gone. This is not healthy in our opinion.

 Although the move, possibly a first, comes three months after a final-year student, Mallepulla Shrikant, 21, committed suicide on the campus, Gopalan denied any direct link between the two.

 The idea behind restricting Net access at all 13 hostels on the Powai campus was to spur healthy inter-personal relationships and check reclusive behaviour, he said.

 Dont link the two. There could be between 150 and 170 students who are addicted to the Internet, but do we have that many suicides? We were the first institution to provide 24-hour connectivity on campus and we have decided that it was perhaps not the right decision, he told The Telegraph.

 The IIT alumni always talks about two things the high academic standards and the wonderful interaction they had with each other. Declining interaction among students is a major concern now.

 He said the restriction would be implemented on an experimental basis for a month and reviewed on April 12. But Net access in common rooms and departments would be allowed all night, he said.

 Iterating that Shrikants suicide was not behind the move, the dean said a panel discussion had been held after the incident and suggestions taken on how to prevent a recurrence.

 The first was the need for greater contact between students and faculty. The second was a 24-hour helpline for students, which they can use if they face psychological problems.

 The surfing restrictions have already sparked anger among the students, with many saying it would eat into the time they had for inter-personal relationships.

 A student, Vikash Kumar, wrote in his blog: General timing of interaction in IITB is evening. But after implementation of this new ban, we will lose this time also.

 We have lab till 5-5:30 and after 11:00 all Internet access will be banned. So, what will be my priority in evening? Meeting with people or working on the Internet?

 Thus, interaction will decrease tremendously among students. And hence, loneliness, depression and probability of suicide will increase.

 A fourth-year student, Vijay Kuppa, said the ban might be good in principle but everyone was being made to suffer because of a small percentage of IITians who spent long hours on the Net.

 Thirteen hours is too long a ban slot. We feel the ban should be between 1 am and, say, 6 am.

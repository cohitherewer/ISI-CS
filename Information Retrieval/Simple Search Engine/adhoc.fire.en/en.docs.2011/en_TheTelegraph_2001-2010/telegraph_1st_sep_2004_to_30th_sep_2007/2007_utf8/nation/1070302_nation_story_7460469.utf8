 PM ends Q stand-off in House

 OUR BUREAU 

 New Delhi, March 1: The Prime Minister today made peace with the Opposition, which has been disrupting Parliament after Ottavio Quattrocchis detention in Argentina. 

 The Opposition had demanded a statement from Manmohan Singh, accusing the Congress-led government of concealing information about the detention of the Bofors case accused. 

 What added fuel to the fire was Singhs comment to the media on the matter when he had not spoken in Parliament.

 Today Singh told the Lok Sabha: We are ready for a discussion on the issue any time. This government has made a commitment not to shy away from any discussion on the floor of the House. 

 The subject will be taken up in the House after discussion on the Presidents address to Parliament is over. 

 We will allow the CBI to pursue the case with full freedom. We did not intend to hurt anybodys sentiments, the Prime Minister said. 

 His assurance, however, came after L.K. Advani, leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, moved an adjournment motion on Quattrocchis detention.

 Singh said he had spoken to the media as reporters had sought his response on the issue.

 Singhs statement today pacified the NDA. Its good the deadlock has ended, said BJP leader Sushma Swaraj.

 Tusker at Amartya home

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Sen: Jumbo trouble 

 Bolpur, June 11: An elephant strayed into a Santiniketan neighbourhood early this morning and damaged the barbed wire fence of Amartya Sens house. 

 The tusker went on the rampage for about half an hour, pulling down boundary walls in the area that houses Visva-Bharatis Shiksha Bhavan. 

 The house of author Samaresh Boses daughter Bulbul, a professor of music at Sangeet Bhavan, was also among those that were destroyed.

 Sens house, Pratichi, where the Nobel laureates late mother used to live, is now looked after by caretaker Arabinda Nandi.

 Nandi said he was woken up by the cries of forest department officials. As he looked out of his window, he saw the elephant emerging out of the darkness. It pulled down a couple of rods of the fence. The night guards later saw the tusker moving towards other houses in the neighbourhood, Nandi said.

 Sub-divisional forest ranger Satya Sundar Bhattacharya said the elephant had come from Illambazar forest, nearly 25 km from Santiniketan.

 It had probably lost its way and was looking for food. When it found itself surrounded by concrete houses, it went on the rampage.... Later, on its way back to the forest, it destroyed paddy fields, Bhattacharya added.

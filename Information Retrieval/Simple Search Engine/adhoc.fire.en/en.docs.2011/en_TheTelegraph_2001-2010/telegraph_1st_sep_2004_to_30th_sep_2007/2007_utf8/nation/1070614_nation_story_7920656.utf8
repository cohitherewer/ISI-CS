 Lanka deports currency racketeer 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 13: A man wanted by the CBI for running a fake currency racket from Dubai has been deported by Sri Lanka, where he was detained last month.

 K.M. Abdullah alias Abdullah Mohammad alias Abdul Aziz is being interrogated at the CBIs Chennai office. He was last week produced in a court in Chennai, where he is wanted in a murder case, and remanded in custody for 12 days. Karnataka and Maharashtra police are also looking for him in fake currency cases.

 Abdullah was detained along with four Sri Lankans who are said to be part of his gang. Authorities recovered Rs 2.6 crore from them and alerted the Indian high commission. 

 The success in getting Abdullah home contrasts with the failure to have Bofors accused Ottavio Quattrocchi extradited.

 Abdullah has been on the run since 1990, when he allegedly killed a person called Hamza. The directorate of revenue intelligence was also on his trail. He has told interrogators about a counterfeit-currency ring whose tentacles spread to Pakistan and India. Dubai and Colombo were used as safe corridors in the illegal business.

 The economic offences wing of the CBI claims Abdullahs fake-currency syndicate has a network of agents in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Mumbai. He is believed to have reached Sri Lanka last December on a fake passport, but it took a while for the Indian high commission in Colombo to track him down and get him deported.

 CBI officials said Abdullah is singing like a canary in custody, giving details of his agents in south India. The police have been alerted about the ring. The Dubai-Colombo route to pump fake currency into India is a relatively new strategy used by criminals, the officials said, adding Abdullahs arrest has blown the lid on this axis.

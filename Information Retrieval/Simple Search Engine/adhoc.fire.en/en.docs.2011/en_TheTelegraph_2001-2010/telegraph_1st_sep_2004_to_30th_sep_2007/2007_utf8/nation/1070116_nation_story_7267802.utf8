 Raid on lab nets skull and crocs

 Agra (PTI): Police dug out remains of 15 baby crocodiles and 100 sea snakes after a laboratory owner and three others were questioned following a raid which threw up a human skull, bones and specimens of prohibited species.

 The laboratory owner Sanjeev Chauhan, along with his brother, father and Mahender Balmiki, were produced in a magistrates court and remanded in judicial custody.

 The four were arrested after raids on the laboratory and Chauhans house on Sunday. A human skull and bones were fished out of a tank inside his house. 

 The laboratory was being run by one Brijesh Upadhyay who is absconding, police said.

 The remains of the crocodiles and snakes were dug out from a plot near Agra College after Chauhan told the police they were buried there when a consignment from Chennai was intercepted during a raid a few months ago.

 The police said no prima facie evidence of trading in human organs has yet been found, but the human bone trade angle is being examined.

 Rs 10000 on leopards head 

 Srinagar (Reuters): Authorities in Kashmir have offered a reward of Rs 10,000 for help in catching a leopard thought to have killed three children in 10 days.

 All the concerned agencies... have been directed to trap the animal immediately, health minister Peer Mohammad Hussain said.

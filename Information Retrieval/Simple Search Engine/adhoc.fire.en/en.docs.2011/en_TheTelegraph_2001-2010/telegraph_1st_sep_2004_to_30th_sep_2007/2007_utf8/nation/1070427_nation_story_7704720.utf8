 Closer scan on VIP passports

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, April 26: Diplomatic passports will no longer ensure smooth passage for VIP travellers.

 In the wake of the human trafficking racket that has snared Babubhai Katara and thrown up the names of some other MPs, the Centre has decided to tighten rules for persons holding such passports. 

 Home ministry sources said the changes in the rules would make it impossible for VIPs, barring a few, to bypass the tough scrutiny at the immigration counter by flashing their diplomatic passports.

 A senior immigration officer would check the passports and visas of the VIPs and their families. If the VIP is reluctant to go to the immigration counter, the officer will come to the VIP lounge.

 And, if required (in case of a doubt), the immigration officer will also have the mandate to check other details like thumb impression and prominent feature of the face, said a home ministry official.

 According to current protocol rules, a diplomatic passport holder can get the formalities completed by merely sending his personal assistant to the immigration counter while he rests at the VIP lounge.

 The new rules would also apply to VIPs returning from abroad. The immigration officer will have the power to stop and check them if they arouse suspicion in any way, said an official. 

 The only people exempt from the scrutiny are the President, Vice-President, Prime Minister, Lok Sabha Speaker, Rajya Sabha chairperson, Supreme Court Chief Justice and judges and chief justices of high courts.

 Diplomatic passports are also given to all members of Parliament and government servants from the joint secretary level.

 The amendments to the protocol rules, framed by the home ministrys bureau of immigration, are likely to be announced in a suo motu statement in Parliament in a couple of days by home minister Shivraj Patil. The changes will be notified after that.

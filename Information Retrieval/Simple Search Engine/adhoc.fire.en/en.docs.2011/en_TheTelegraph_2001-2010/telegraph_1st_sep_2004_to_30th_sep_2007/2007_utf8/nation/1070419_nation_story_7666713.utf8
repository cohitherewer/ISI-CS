 Govt plays hardball with IIMs

 - HRD ministry asks B-schools to wait for court verdict

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, April 18: The human resource development ministry is still talking tough with the IIMs despite the snub from the Supreme Court.

 The ministry doesnt want the B-schools to release their admission lists for general category students on April 21, the deadline they have set.

 Hours after the apex court fixed April 23 for the next hearing on reservation for other backward classes, sources in the ministry said the management institutes should wait for the verdict. 

 Heavens will not fall if they do not implement the process by April 21, a source said, adding that he hoped the responsible people running the premier institutes would keep national interest in mind. 

 But the source did not say why the government is showing little concern for the general category students. If the court does not lift the stay on April 23 and the government insists that the result freeze continue, the candidates will have to decide whether to wait for the final IIM list or accept calls from other business schools. 

 IIM directors are expected to meet ministry officials in Delhi before April 21 to sort out matters as the fate of hundreds of students hangs in balance. The academic session in IIMs usually begins in June.

 The institutes have already sent a letter to the ministry informing it of their decision to release the list. But till now, the ministry has not officially acknowledged the missive.

 The ministry sources said the decision to release the general category list goes against the will of Parliament, which passed the OBC reservation bill mandating introduction of quotas from this academic year. The IIMs are not above Parliament, they said. They will have to yield to its collective will.

 One option before the ministry is to allow the IIMs to release the general category result and hold back the OBC list while the issue is before the court.

 But HRD officials are not keen on this option. They say it would set a precedent for other institutions.

 With the ministry firm, smaller IIMs like those in Indore, Lucknow and Kozhikode are wary of angering the government. They are still dependent on the ministry for finances, though their three affluent counterparts Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta no longer take funds from the Centre.

 But the government can penalise the big three through other means. For instance, it can deny permission to set up a campus abroad.

 At home, babus swallow bad news

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, June 14: As one Patil readies for the journey to Rashtrapati Bhavan, another has been confined to home. 

 A pall of gloom enveloped North Block, which houses the home ministry, this evening when Sonia Gandhi announced the name of Pratibha Patil, not Shivraj Patil, as the UPA candidate for President.

 Faces fell in many corners, but not all were shedding tears for the home minister.

 Among the disappointed were bureaucrats who were planning to breathe easy for a while.

 Patil is known for giving long weekly lectures on profound topics such as the Indian Constitution. A stickler for details, the minister has also driven many a mandarin up the wall, holding marathon meetings to prepare answers to questions in Parliament. 

 But Sonias announcement has plugged what the bureaucrats were hoping to be their escape route, at least till the next big cabinet shuffle. It is the grim reality, it is our fate, sighed a seasoned bureaucrat. 

 Some of Patils personal officers, busy drawing up plans to shift to the sprawling Rashtrapati Bhavan environs, were also in mourning.

 It is a bad decision. I do not know what grudge the Left politicians have against our saheb whose stature is well known, said a member of Patils personal staff.

 The other day he was busy counting presidential votes, concluding prematurely as it turned out that his boss has sufficient numbers to make it to Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 Another section, too, has been hit hard: wannabe home ministers in the political class. But few in the club would venture out to admit so.

 A minister of state with independent charge is said to be among those whose hopes to move into North Block have been dashed.

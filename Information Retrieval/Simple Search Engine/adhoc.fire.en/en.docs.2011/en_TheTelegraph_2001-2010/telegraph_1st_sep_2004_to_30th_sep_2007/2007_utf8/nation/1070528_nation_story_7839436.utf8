 PF rate put off, now for Goa poll

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 27: The Employees Provident Fund today again deferred a decision on the interest to be paid on savings for 2006-07 and 2007-08.

 The official reason was that the funds central board of trustees could not take a decision because the Election Commissions model code of conduct for the Goa Assembly polls had come into effect.

 We are told that because of the (Assembly) elections in Goa, we should not take any decision; so the matter has been deferred, said the boards chairman, labour minister Oscar Fernandes, after a two-hour meeting.

 The board had failed to fix the rates at its last meeting in March, too. It is likely to discuss the subject next on July 2.

 Trade unions are against the interest rate being lowered below the 8.5 per cent paid out in 2005-06. If possible, they want it raised by up to 1 per cent to make it competitive with state-run banks that are paying between 9 and 9.5 per cent on long-term savings.

 The state-run fund, in which some four crore salaried and wage-earning individuals have to compulsorily invest, has been arguing that an 8.5 per cent rate would wipe out Rs 450 crore a year from its corpus.

 The finance and investment committee of the EPF board, however, had observed in March 2006 that only an 8 per cent rate was sustainable during 2006-07. 

 Fernandes said for 2006-07, the interest rate would depend on the money available with the EPF while the higher rates offered by commercial banks would be taken into account for future calculations.

 He said that employees who were retiring could draw their money at the current rate of 8.5 per cent.

 Fernandes said the most telling effect of the failure to declare the rate would be felt in updating annual accounts and furnishing information on balances to members.

 Assets blow to Lalu

 Lalu Prasad

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: Having given the jitters to Mayavati in the Taj Corridor scandal, the CBI has now sought the Union law ministrys permission to appeal against Lalu Prasads acquittal in an assets case.

 The railway minister, a Congress ally, and his wife Rabri Devi were acquitted by a Patna court on December 18 last year. The CBI, which has 90 days to challenge the verdict, has been criticised by the Opposition over its tardiness in seeking permission to file an appeal.

 The Nitish Kumar government in Bihar had already consulted the state advocate-general about appealing the acquittals if the CBI didnt. The law ministry now has about a month before the 90-day deadline passes.

 The CBI, asked to probe the case by Patna High Court in March 1996, had accused Lalu Prasad of amassing Rs 46 lakh worth of property in excess of his known sources of income as Bihar chief minister between 1990 and 1997. Rabri was named an abettor.

 In the Taj Corridor funds mismanagement scandal, the CBI has submitted all material and documents, including the investigation report, before a Lucknow court after having its closure report quashed by the Supreme Court.

 This case, too, is politically sensitive as the Congress is believed to be going soft on former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati, seen as the main challenger to Mulayam Singh Yadav in the upcoming state elections.

 Tata salvo at rehab delay

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jamshedpur, June 13: Tata Steel today used a public platform to criticise the Jharkhand government for delaying the announcement of a rehabilitation and resettlement policy.

 The rare display of displeasure came from Partha Sengupta, the steel majors principal executive officer to the managing director and the head of the Jharkhand project.

 Sengupta fired the salvo while addressing a panel discussion on Jharkhand: addressing the challenges of inclusive development. 

 The seminar was organised by the state government and the World Bank.

 Sengupta said the government did not bother to think about the consequences when signing memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with prospective investors in the absence of a policy and infrastructure. The myopic vision of the government is stopping the MoUs from being realised, he said. 

 The government signed MoUs left, right and centre. We often hear the rehabilitation policy is ready and will be declared within 15 days. Many 15 days have passed but the government has not come out with the policy, Sengupta said. We are pained when people talk with a myopic vision for the displaced.

 The comments followed deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahtos announcement during the inaugural speech that the policy would be unveiled soon. The government is very serious about developing the state and we are going to forward the rehabilitation policy to the cabinet for clearance, Mahto said.

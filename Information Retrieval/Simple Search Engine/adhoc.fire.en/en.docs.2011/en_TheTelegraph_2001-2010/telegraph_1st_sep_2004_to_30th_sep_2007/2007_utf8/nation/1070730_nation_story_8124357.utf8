 Sea terror alert on west coast

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI 

 Mumbai, July 29: Maharashtra and Goa are on high alert following intelligence inputs about a terrorist attack along the coast, possibly on a port or a harbour. 

 According to sources in the Indian Coast Guard, 83 Indian fishing boats impounded by the Pakistan Navy off the Gujarat coast in the past few months are expected to be used to launch attacks on sensitive coastal installations, including ONGCs offshore projects.

 The intelligence report has indicated that terrorist groups aided by the ISI are planning to strike using apprehended Indian fishermen as decoys, the sources added.

 Pakistan and India routinely arrest fishermen who stray into each others waters.

 The reports indicate that the fishing boats could be used by trained Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorists to carry out strikes against India. Apprehended Indian fishermen could be used as decoys to steer the boats into Indian waters or even as human shields, said a source. 

 The anti-terrorist squad of Maharashtra police said it was aware of the intelligence input. 

 There is an alert against terrorist attacks from the sea. But it has been there since the last three months, said assistant commissioner of police Parambir Singh. 

 Goa police, too, have confirmed it. 

 As per our information, islands off the Goa and Gujarat coasts are being used to offload recce groups by terrorist networks. These infrequented islands, many of which are underwater during high tides, serve as ideal spots to sneak into India. They are often used by smugglers to offload goods, said N.S. Randhawa, the Goa inspector-general of police.

 We are on high vigil, especially after the recent bust of a terror module by police in Gujarats Kutch area, he added.

 Following leads from their investigation after busting the terror module, Kutch police along with the Maharashtra ATS raided a sleeper cell of the Pakistan-based militant outfit, al Badr, last week.

 The prime operative, Mohammed Salim Memon, is a Pakistani national who had been living in Mumbais Bhendi Bazaar for 30 years. His interrogation is expected to reveal details about possible terror plots, including maritime ones.

 As per intelligence reports, al Qaida-backed Yemeni terrorists Yasir Ahmed and Al Hadrami alias Sultan Bin Mirda have organised reconnaissance of some parts of the Maharashtra-Goa coastline through sleeper cells. Lashkar-e-Toiba militants are now being trained to launch maritime attacks, said a coast guard source.

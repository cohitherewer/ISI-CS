 New Delhi, Jan. 14: Britain is set to welcome a new breed of teddy bears and a brand of bags from India, made from cotton woven by blind women in a Chennai convent.

 Students of the University of Portsmouth are on the verge of launching a company that will sell the soft toys and bags, with the proceeds going to the women at Chennais Little Flower Convent.

 The design will be western, the cloth Indian. The idea British, the hand Indian.

 Sue Noble, professor of fashion and textile enterprise at the university, who visited Chennai three times between September 2005 and November 2006, calls the experience a lesson on the merits of globalisation.

 All my students read about the problems of globalisation day in and day out. This project has taught them the merits of globalisation, and how they can help others around the world by working with them, she says.

 Noble, who brought four students with her on her last trip to Chennai, says the company to be run entirely by her students would be up and running by October.

 For the women stitching the cloth that will soon enter British homes as cuddly toys and bags, the project holds the promise of a livelihood better than they could ever have imagined.

 Till now, the cloth they wove was being used by hospitals to clean their floors, said Sister Dominica, principal of Little Flower.

 Over the past few years, the hospitals have almost stopped buying the cloth, leading to growing desperation among the women, who study, pray and live in the convent.

 Machine-stitched cloth, mass-produced by companies, is cheaper and the women at Little Flower have seen their already meagre earnings dwindle further.

 In Europe, cloth that has been hand-stitched can be priced high. The returns from the project will be a huge jump over what the women are now earning, Noble said.

 A Chennai-based NGO, the Kothari Academy, will buy the cloth and get it stitched into teddy bears and bags along designs emailed by the Portsmouth students.

 The final products have already been successfully market-tested and displayed at Portsmouth City Museum during the National Crafts Council Exhibition, Noble said.

 Students from the university modelled for the bags. The products were extremely popular, Noble said.

 It was the students response to the first 20 metres of cloth she had brought back from Chennai that had sealed the matter. Her entire class of 30, from diverse ethnic backgrounds, agreed to participate in the project, Noble said.

 At the convent, the nuns say everybody is excited. Looks like its going to be a happy new year, one of them said.

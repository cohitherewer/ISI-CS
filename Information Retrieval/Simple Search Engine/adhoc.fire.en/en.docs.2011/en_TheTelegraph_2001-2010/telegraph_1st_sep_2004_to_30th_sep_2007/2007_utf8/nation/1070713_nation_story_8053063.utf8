 Centre clears Videocon SEZ

 OUR BUREAU

 July 12: Videocons planned biotechnology park in Siliguri is among 21 SEZ proposals that won conditional approval from the Union commerce ministry today.

 The Navi Mumbai SEZ, promoted by Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, was also approved with the condition that the 1,250-hectare enclave should have the basic facilities ensuring contiguity.

 The promoters should build the infrastructure that ensures contiguity within a year, said G.K. Pillai, the commerce secretary and chairman of the board of approvals.

 For Videocon, the clearance means it can open talks with potential foreign partners for the 24-hectare park coming up at Dabgram near Siliguri. We can engage collaborators from abroad, said Gautam Sengupta, the chief operating officer, in Calcutta. 

 Sengupta said the clearance would help push forward talks with a company in Taiwan and another in France. As consultants, both will help build the processing and marketing facilities needed for the horticulture, herbal medicine and floriculture products, said Sengupta, who heard about the approval from the Bengal government.

 A blueprint for the project will be ready in about three weeks and construction is expected to begin soon after. 

 A request has been made to the state government for more land adjacent to the existing plot. This will be used for the second phase of the project an IT hardware park. Some headway has been made in this (more land) during talks with ministers and officials, Sengupta said.

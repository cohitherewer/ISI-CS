 AIIMS forgery

 New Delhi, June 24 (PTI): A former AIIMS director has been summoned by a court in a decade-old criminal case in which he has been accused of denying a doctor the post of assistant professor.

 The metropolitan magistrate yesterday issued the summons for July 14 to S.K. Kacker, former AIIMS director and member secretary of its selection committee in 1993.

 The complaint by Anoop Saraya said that Kacker along with Rakesh K. Tandon, then head of the gastroenterology department, had forged minutes of the committee meeting and deleted his name from the waiting list of candidates.

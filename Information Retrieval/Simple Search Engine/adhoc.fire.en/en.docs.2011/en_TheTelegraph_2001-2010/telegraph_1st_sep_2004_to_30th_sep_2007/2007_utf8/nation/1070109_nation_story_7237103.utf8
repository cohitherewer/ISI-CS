 Cops claim Cyberabad case solved

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Jan. 8: Hyderabad police today claimed to have resolved the case of serial killing of nine persons in the state capital over the last one month.

 Cyberabad commissioner of police S. Prabhakar Reddy said three persons have been arrested so far. They have been identified as N. Ramulu, Pavan and Ravinder Reddy.

 Ramulu and Pavan, who lived in shanties, had been picked up earlier for questioning.

 The police said the murders of the nine persons, including two women, occurred in and around garbage dumps.

 Most of the killings, they added, were apparently carried out for money and some for sex. The bodies of at least one of the women has traces of rape and we do not rule out any homosexual attacks, said a police official.

 Police said Ramulu has confessed to have killed at least eight persons for monetary gain and sex.

 Blast accused springs Holy War plea

 Mumbai, May 9: As Sanjay Dutt today sat sulking in his usual corner of the courtroom in trademark blue shirt and denims, accused No. 32 sprang a surprise.

 Zakir Hussain, convicted for lobbing hand grenades on the Mahim causeway, urged special judge Pramod Kode to watch Father, Son and the Holy War before pronouncing the Bombay blast sentences from May 18.

 Hussain gave no reasons in his written application, but lawyer Farhana Shah said Anand Patwardhans documentary dwelt on the link between the Babri Masjid demolition, Mumbai riots and the 1993 serial blasts and might throw light on why the accused got involved in the conspiracy.

 Shah handed over an envelope containing the film CD but judge Kode said he would decide later whether to watch it.

 Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam opposed the plea, saying it was yet another frivolous application aimed at delaying the verdict.

 There is no material before the court about the CD nor is Anand Patwardhan present in the court. How can the contents of the CD be taken as gospel truth? The accused wants the court to take a lenient view, but the court should not succumb to such tactics, Nikam said.

 Father, Son and The Holy War is Patwardhans third documentary on fundamentalism after In Memory of Friends (on Punjab terrorism) and Ram Ke Naam (on L.K. Advanis rath yatra and the Babri Masjid demolition). Holy War tries to establish a parallel between the rise of fundamentalism, male dominance and its link with violence.

 It won the national award for best social documentary in 1995 and best investigative documentary in 1996. Patwardhan fought a prolonged court battle against Doordarshans reluctance to beam the film during the NDA regime. It was eventually shown on Doordarshan in October 2006.

 Surprised his film had figured in a court trial, Patwardhan said: The film is a critique of Hindu and Muslim fundamentalism and provides the background to the events of 1992-93. It certainly could be relevant since the serial blasts did not happen in a vacuum.

 I would be happy if the court decides to see it, but the fate of the accused should not rely on whether the court is influenced by a film.

 Ottavio prod from court

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 26: The Supreme Court today asked the Centre to submit details of steps it has taken to bring Ottavio Quattrocchi back to India.

 A bench of Justices C.K. Thakkar and V.S. Sirpurkar called the Bofors controversy serious and said it hoped the government was taking it seriously, too.

 It is a serious matter and we hope the government is also seriously viewing it, the court said while issuing notices to the cabinet secretariat, the ministry of external affairs and the CBI, seeking their replies within a week.

 The order came on an application filed by Delhi-based lawyer Ajay Agarwal who sought directives to the CBI to extradite the Italian businessman, the only accused left in the gun bribery case.

 Additional solicitor general Gopal Subramanium told the court the government would answer all questions in its reply. He also said a CBI team was planning to leave for Argentina to seek Quattrocchis extradition.

 But the bench did not say anything specifically on allegations of contempt by Agarwal, who on Saturday said the CBI kept mum on Quattrocchis detention when an earlier application he had filed seeking the businessmans presence came up in the apex court.

 Agarwal again accused the CBI of concealing facts during todays hearing, minutes after a report that Quattrocchi has been released from detention.

 The CBI had hidden the fact about his release by a court in Argentina on February 23 during todays hearing, he said, adding that he would seek urgent hearing in the matter as the CBI was trying to hush up the case.

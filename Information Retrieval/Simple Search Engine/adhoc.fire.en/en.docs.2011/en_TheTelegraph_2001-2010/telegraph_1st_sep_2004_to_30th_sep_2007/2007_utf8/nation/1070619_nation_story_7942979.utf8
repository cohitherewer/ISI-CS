 Plane turns back after snag scare

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 18: After the strike comes the scare.

 An Indian flight today gave passengers a shock when it returned to Singapores Changi airport 30 minutes after take-off. 

 The incident comes days after a strike by ground staff disrupted flights across the country.

 Sources said the pilots of the IC-860 did not consider it safe to continue with the journey to Delhi after it detected a snag. There was some problem with the Airbuss avionics (aircraft electronics), they said. 

 The pilots then took permission from the Singapore air traffic control for a precautionary landing and turned back, the sources said.

 The plane has been taken to a remote bay and is going through checks, airline officials said.

 Both state-run carriers, Indian and Air India, which are set to merge, have aging planes prone to problems.

 On April 21, around 154 Dubai-bound passengers of Air India were taken to hotels after their Boeing-757 developed engine trouble. On April 9, two of its flights made emergency landings in Delhi, because of technical reasons.

 In February, the government had admitted to a string of incidents involving Indian. Most of these were blamed on hydraulic failures, including those in landing gear. 

 Hydraulic failures in Airbus A320s flown by Indian is a known problem area, the civil aviation ministry said in a report to a parliamentary panel. A few weeks ago, another government report spoke of serial mechanical snags in the airlines aging fleet and identified 10 problem areas where the snags occurred.

 On Airbus A310 planes, the ministry said inspections had been made more frequent and modifications made in their engines. At the same time Airbus, the European plane maker, had suggested new installation procedures which would be implemented soon.

 The report said some problems had been sorted out and the few areas where improvement was needed will be taken up with the aircraft-makers and suppliers of spares.

 But even after the snag-prone areas have been pointed out, the ministry has not worked out its proposed three-pronged check before take-off. 

 Under a plan drawn up by the directorate-general of civil aviation, planes have to be put through three levels of checks. In the first, maintenance engineers will run a scan every two days. In the second, quality assurance teams of both airlines will examine aircraft fitness. In the third, DGCA officials will inspect the full fleet.

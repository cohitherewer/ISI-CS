 8-year-old in board exam

 LALMOHAN PATNAIK

 Cuttack, March 6: He is Balasores Budhia Singh, but in a different field. And hes more a sprinter than a marathoner.

 Eight-year-old Millennium Bismoy will write his Class X board exam starting tomorrow, joining the likes of Bihars Tathagat Tulsi, 9, and Uttar Pradeshs Sushama Verma, 7, in the club of Indias exam prodigies.

 But its with Budhia that the parallels are strongest.

 Just as the state government had tried to stop the four-year-old (now five) marathoner from running, it had barred Millennium from the exam after holding a special competence test in November. 

 After months of uncertainty, Orissa High Court today allowed Millennium to sit for the exam. The boy, who has not received any formal education, will write nine papers.

 Father Laxmikanta and mother Manorama, school-teachers both, did not enrol the boy in school because they didnt want to do injustice to his extraordinary skills. 

 Psychologists are divided. Millenniums case is just like Budhias. It will encourage more parents to try and exhaust their children for selfish reasons, said Pratap Rath, professor at Utkal University.

 Fellow psychologist Pramod Mohanty differed. Millennium is a prodigy with a high IQ.

 The state board had argued it couldnt let Millennium take the exam as he had not studied in any institution. Also, state law bars under-14s from the school-leaving exam.

 Just as Budhia wants to win the Olympic marathon, Millenniums goal is to become a Nobel laureate, his parents said. The boy wasnt available for comment.

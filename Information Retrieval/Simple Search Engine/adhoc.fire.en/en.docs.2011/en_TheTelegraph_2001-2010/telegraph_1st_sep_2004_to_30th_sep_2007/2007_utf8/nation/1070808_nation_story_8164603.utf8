The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Friendly feeler to rebel league

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Pawar

 Aug. 7: Cricket board chief Sharad Pawar today gave a guarded but apparently positive response to Congress leader Digvijay Singhs call for a reconciliation with the rebel Indian Cricket League, indicating politics may unite where sport had threatened to divide.

 Tomorrow, the Board of Control for Cricket in India is expected to discuss its stand on the Zee-promoted league, which it has so far refused to recognise.

 Asked about the Congress general secretarys letter to him not to take a confrontationist stand, Pawar wouldnt react directly but said the board would encourage any initiative that helped Test cricket.

 Test cricket is the real thing. We would be happy if anyone does something for the sake of Test cricket, the Union agriculture minister said.

 He went on: But Twenty20 is for glamour. It can only bring in money. ICL officials, though, have said the league wont be confined to Twenty20.

 ICL vice-president Gaurav Sethi preferred to reserve comment till the context of Pawars remarks became clear. On the face of it, the statement sounds friendly.

 Sources suggested politics was the key: Diggy Raja can influence four votes in board elections. One belongs to the state association of Madhya Pradesh, his home turf. Digvijay is also the party minder for Assam and Andhra Pradesh, where the Andhra and Hyderabad associations have a vote each.

 Besides, the sources said, Digvijays initiative has the support of the Congress central leadership that controls the votes of the Services, Railways, Combined Universities and all party-ruled states.

 Sources close to Zee boss Subhas Chandra hinted the ICL may consider accepting some sort of regulation for a truce with the board.

 The peace initiative began last week when Digvijay was in Mumbai. ICL chairman Kapil Dev had called on him to seek fair play.

 The ex-cricketer complained of receiving a tongue-lashing from Pawar for having attacked him after the board had threatened a life ban if players flirted with the breakaway league.

 Digvijay got in touch with distant relative Raj Singh Dungarpur, a veteran of cricket administration, who advised him to speak to Pawar, his one-time mentor. The board chief agreed in spirit to treat the ICL fairly, and the letter followed.

 The sources said the letter may have sought to strengthen Pawars hands by asking him to prevail on the hardliners in the traditionally faction-ridden board.

 Digvijay said he was happy with Pawars reaction.

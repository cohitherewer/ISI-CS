 Young Lalu turns 60 with nation

Patna, June 11: Lalu Prasad doesnt know his date of birth. But the blind date he picked has ensured that the railway minister turned 60 the same year as Independent India.

 If anyone forgot the date discrepancy amid the flurry of calls and flowers, old friend and current rival Nitish Kumar was at hand with a reminder. After wishing Lalu Prasad all success in railways and politics, the Bihar chief minister said: Laluji himself does not know which day he was born on. Still I wish him all happiness on the day people celebrate his birthday. 

 Lalu Prasad, though, has been reminding his supporters that today might not be his big day. My mother could not recall the day I was born. So I dont know the day of my birth.

 But that didnt come in the way of celebrations or Lalu Prasads flash of wit. 

 Saatha par paatha (one turns young and energetic at 60), the minister said, borrowing from a Bhojpuri adage.

 Lalu Prasads birthday bash and cake-cutting stayed confined to Delhi, where his Rashtriya Janata Dal is holding its national executive. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi were among those who greeted the railway minister at his Delhi home.

 Horror keeps pigeons hungry amp; in hiding

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 A flock of pigeons at the mosque: Terror-struck

 Hyderabad, May 20: Pigeons have a special place in Mecca Masjid.

 Fluttering around the 313-year-old shrine, they are a huge draw for both worshippers and visitors.

 But since Friday when terror struck their dwelling place the pigeons coos seem to have got stuck in their throats. 

 Now, they mostly stay inside the mosque, in the nooks and crannies of its high columns, perhaps hiding from the air of dread that still hangs over their home.

 The massive water tank built by Emperor Aurangzeb near the entrance to the shrine where the faithful wash their hands and face used to be the pigeons favourite haunt at night. But they dont flock to the tank now. It is near here that an improvised explosive device had gone off, leaving several people dead, among them children as young as five.

 The birds used to be fed jawar and other grain by priests at the mosque, and also by worshippers and visitors, many of them Hindus.

 But since the blast, most people have had to stay off the mosque. The bandh that followed saw a security blanket being thrown around the shrine.

 I tried my best to feed them one or two kilograms of rice. But with the commotion and the cordoning off of mosque, the birds were scared to come down and eat. They, however, consumed everything when night fell, said Maulana Khaliluddin, a cleric.

 When the mosques stock began drying up, the priests requested police and government authorities to provide food for the birds. Ten kg of grain was organised today.

 Some of the pigeon-keepers at Mecca Masjid use the birds to deliver posts, like in ancient times. They sometimes fly as far as Telengana. 

 Several Muslim farmers in the neighbourhood still use pigeons for communication though mobile phones are also very popular, said Mohammed Abdulla Khan, a bird keeper at the mosque.

 Till the pigeons recover from the shock of the black, bloody Friday, the cellphones will have to work overtime.

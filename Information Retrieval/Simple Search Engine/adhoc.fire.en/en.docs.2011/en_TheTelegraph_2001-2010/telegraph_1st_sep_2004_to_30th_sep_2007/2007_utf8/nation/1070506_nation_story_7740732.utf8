 Interpol sounded for trail of trafficker

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, May 5: Andhra Pradesh police have approached Interpol for the whereabouts of alleged trafficking kingpin Mohammed Shakeel and another person called Raju Pitti.

 The cops were in for a surprise when they landed at the regional passport office for more information on Shakeel alias Shameem, a close associate of arrested mastermind Mohammed Rasheed.

 They found that the office had issued 15 passports in Shakeels name with different addresses and photographs. The police are now trying to trace his driver to identify the real Shakeel, a graduate with an NRI wife.

 Investigations have revealed that the native of Nizamabad, a father of three, has been sending unemployed Muslim youths to the Gulf since early 1996.

 In 1999, he joined the BJP but switched over to the Telugu Desam Party after being refused an Assembly ticket. 

 Last month, he contested the legislative council elections but lost. Soon after, he went into hiding when the trafficking scam hit headlines. Shakeel is said to be constructing two bungalows, including one in Hyderabad, each costing Rs 3 crore.

 The sources said Rasheed has told the police that Shakeel was the fixer at the passport office and immigration cells of the Hyderabad airport for all deals they had struck.

 Investigators are also on the lookout for another operator known as Raju Pitti alias America Pitti, a Gujarati. Although in Chicago now, Pitti is said to be a frequent visitor to Hyderabad who advised Rasheed and Shakeel on American immigration procedures.

 Pitti is also known as a producer with a defunct company, American Films. But the company has no known films to its credit. Recent police reports say Pitti has been absconding since he suffered huge betting losses during the World Cup.

 SEZ on hold for relief plan

 OUR BUREAU 

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: The Prime Ministers Office has decided that the rural development ministry will come up with a relief and rehabilitation policy to give displaced farmers a better deal before any more special economic zones are cleared.

 A senior commerce ministry official, however, clarified that the policy to set up SEZs to boost exports and generate more jobs has not been shelved, but merely held in abeyance until the relief package is put in place.

 The package will be vetted by a group of ministers and no land acquisitions for SEZs will be undertaken till then, he added.

 It will take about two months to finalise the package. It will be approved by the cabinet and given statutory force to make it mandatory for state governments to implement it, a senior rural development ministry official said.

 Rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, who is also a member of the group of ministers on SEZs, has been entrusted with the task of drawing up the relief and rehabilitation policy. 

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath said in Bangalore that the group of ministers would be meeting on January 22 to see whether states have been following the norms for acquiring land for SEZs and drawing up a policy.

 There has been mounting pressure from the Left parties, which have accused state governments of grabbing land from farmers in the garb of SEZs. There has also been a rethink within the Congress after party president Sonia Gandhi expressed similar concerns at the recent chief ministers conclave in Nainital.

 The explosive political fallout over land acquisition at Nandigram and Singur in Bengal finally jolted the Centre to action. 

 With the Uttar Pradesh and Punjab elections round the corner, the Congress does not want to give the impression that it is not doing enough for farmers. 

 However, the decision has raised the hackles of industry. This is an alarming situation. We think the Prime Minister should call for a meeting of industry chambers and state governments, to find clarity on the issue, Assocham president Venugopal Dhoot said.

 The meeting of the commerce ministrys board of approvals, which was to take up more than 70 new SEZ cases on January 19, has also been postponed till the group of ministers takes a stand on the issue. 

 According to Kamal Nath, 237 SEZs across the country have been approved so far, of which 44 have been notified. The total area marked for the 237 SEZs is 34,510 hectares.

 As many as 11 SEZs have been approved for Bengal alone, six of which have been cleared in-principle by the commerce ministry.

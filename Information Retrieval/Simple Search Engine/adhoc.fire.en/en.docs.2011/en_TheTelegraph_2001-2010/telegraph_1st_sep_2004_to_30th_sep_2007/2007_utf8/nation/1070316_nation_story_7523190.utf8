 5-hr tax grill for Hasan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 15: Pune-based race-horse owner Hasan Ali Khan was today questioned by income-tax officials about alleged tax evasion and violation of the money laundering act.

 Khan spent at least five hours at the office of S.S.N. Moorthy, director general (investigation) of income tax, answering questions on the alleged money-laundering scam, IT officials said.

 Dressed in a white shirt and sporting sunglasses, 53-year-old Khan left Moorthys office around 7 pm in a silver Mercedes. He ducked questions from the waiting media contingent.

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: Prem Lall, 90, would be grateful she forgets so easily.

 The grandmother is back home in Green Park with help from the law after months of a nightmare in Singapore, where she thought she had gone on a holiday.

 The child I looked after from the day he was born till two months ago deceived me, says Lall, sitting in the garden of her Rs 8.5-crore house, as daughters Nalini and Sarita put their arms around her protectively.

 On Monday, Delhi High Court cancelled a gift of deed of property that eldest grandson Chaitanya had got Lall to sign after taking her with him to Singapore.

 This is unfortunate that all the people in the family are behaving like sharks and vultures, the court said, ordering Chaitanya to return Rs 4.5 lakh withdrawn from Lalls account without her knowledge by August 30. 

 The independent nonagenarian, who divides her time between the US where her three daughters live and India where she has her books and nice neighbours, went to Singapore in May to stay with her grandson for two months. Chaitanya is the son of Lalls eldest daughter Manju, who lives in the US like her sisters but is not in touch with them. 

 The breaking point for me was when I tried to call my mother and the maid who picked up the mobile refused to give it to her. My mother was at the airport checking in to go to Singapore, says Sarita, Lalls youngest daughter, who is a research scientist. 

 Over the next few months, Sarita and Nalini were cut off from their mother. 

 I became concerned and came to India to find that our house had a guard outside it. I was not allowed in. My nephew had started negotiations with a builder, says Nalini, a doctor like her mother.

 Since she did not even have Chaitanyas address, Nalini, who arrived in Delhi in July, had to hire a detective to trace Lall. But when she reached the place in Singapore where her nephew lives, she was not allowed to see her mother and reported for trespassing. 

 I was grilled by police for seven hours. My nephews wife then promised to bring my mother back to India with her the next day. I believed her, says Nalini, who had meanwhile filed a habeas corpus petition seeking a directive to Chaitanya to produce his grandmother in court.

 She (Chaitanyas wife) was lying. She was not even booked on the flight. I had to go back to Singapore again. I was then told that my mother had left the country. But we didnt know where she had gone. I finally met my mother when they brought her in a wheelchair to court.

 Lall was brought to court on August 17 and the ruling ordering the return of her house came on August 21. 

 Getting cheated by her grandchild has been painful, but Lall has something to be thankful about. I am known to forget things, she smiles.

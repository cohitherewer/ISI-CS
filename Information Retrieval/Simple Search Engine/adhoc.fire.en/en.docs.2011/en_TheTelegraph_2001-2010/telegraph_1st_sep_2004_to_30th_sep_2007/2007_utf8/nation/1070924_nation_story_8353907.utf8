 Hyderabad, Sept. 23: Hyderabad is on its toes to ensure security for a world conference on space technologies, the first big event being hosted here since the August 25 blasts forced the cancellation of a flagship badminton tournament.

 Space traveller Sunita Williams is expected to be the biggest attraction at the 58th International Astronautical Congress that begins tomorrow.

 Andhra Pradesh police are working with central agenc- ies to put in place unprecedented security for the over 2,000 delegates, including senior officials of Nasa who are expected to take part in the five-day conference. 

 Isro, National Remote Sensing Agency, the Astronautical Society of India and the Paris-based International Astronautical Federation, the events organisers, do not believe the blasts have cast a shadow, though the Indian Open badminton tournament, scheduled late last month, was cancelled.

 B.N. Suresh, director of the Vikram Sarabhai Space Research Centre, felt there was no reason to be worried as the blasts were not targeted at a political party or agency in Hyderabad.

 But the police are taking no chances. About 1,000 personnel will be on guard at the Hyderabad International Convention Centre, the venue in Cyberabad.

 The safety drill was stepped up this evening following intelligence inputs that terrorists were targeting the life-size Buddha granite statue at Hussainsagar Lake.

 The arrangements for the conference are more elaborate than those made for the Prime Minister since it involves top scientists and technology experts, said A.C. Lincoln, DCP, Cyberabad.

 Hurriyat for peace talks

 Islamabad, Jan. 20 (PTI): Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq has called for an end to armed struggle to resolve the Kashmir dispute as it has only created more graveyards.

 The dialogue process to resolve the Kashmir issue should be given a chance as efforts through military means have not achieved any results except creating more graveyards, said the Mirwaiz, who is heading a three-member Hurriyat delegation to Pakistan.

 With the new strategy, the Hurriyat would convince India to arrive at a more agreeable settlement, he said last night at a dinner hosted by the Prime Minister of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Attique Khan. 

 The delegation also met President Pervez Musharraf.

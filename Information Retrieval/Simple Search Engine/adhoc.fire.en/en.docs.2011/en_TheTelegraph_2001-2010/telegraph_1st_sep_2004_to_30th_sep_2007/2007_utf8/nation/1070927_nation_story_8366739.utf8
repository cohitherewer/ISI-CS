 Lonely Jaya tries setu to Sangh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: Jayalalithaas ADMK today took its first step to inch nearer to the Sangh parivar by making common cause with it over the Ram setu.

 The party, facing total isolation in the third front, gunned for Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhis scalp for allegedly hurting the sentiments of Hindus by questioning the existence of Ram.

 The dharna at Jantar Mantar received a fillip from a similar demonstration by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad that was held a few yards away.

 Although it was not a joint rally, both players raised similar slogans revering Ram and slamming Karunanidhi. But they maintained a distance, possibly because no decision has yet been taken on such a team-up.

 The ADMK got no support in its sack mission from the third front, called the United National Progressive Alliance. Telugu Desam chief Chandrababu Naidu said the issue was specific to Tamil Nadu.

 The ADMKs demand seeking dismissal of the Karunanidhi government is a state issue, he told reporters.

 Sangh invite awaits Sonia

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sonia

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh today said it would invite Congress president Sonia Gandhi to the ceremony concluding the birth centenary celebrations of their ideologue, Madhavrao Sadashivrao Golwalkar.

 According to Bajrang Lal Gupt of the RSS, who heads the Shri Guruji Birth Centenary Celebrations Committee that is organising the event in Delhi on February 18, invitations would be sent to all important persons in the capital, including Sonia.

 The Congress, however, spurned the Sanghs overtures.

 The programme will have RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan talking about social harmony along with Sadhvi Ritambhara, known for her outbursts during the Ramjanmabhoomi movement.

 Impossible, Congress general secretary B.K. Hariprasad said when asked whether Sonia would attend the event. We do not need to learn lessons on Hindutva from Golwalkar or the RSS.

 The Sangh, however, is undaunted. Gupt insisted that not just the Congress boss, members of other political parties, ambassadors of countries and anyone who is not hostile to the Hindutva ideology would be sent an invite.

 This is a function to enforce the idea of equality in Hindu society. The RSS is against discrimination on the basis of caste. Guruji himself opposed the idea of caste-based discrimination. We want to reinforce those values. It is a social function, so nobody should have any objections about participating in it, the Sangh veteran said.

 He added that even Muslims would be invited as evidence of the outfits belief in equality. 

 Senior RSS office-bearer Madan Das Devi said the Sangh has decided to discuss the recommendations of the Sachar committee report on minorities facing discrimination during its pratinidhi sabha meeting in Lucknow next month.

 We are against the government using the report for the political purpose of extending communal reservations. But we are not against the report per se. In fact, we would be discussing the recommendations of the report shortly, Devi said.

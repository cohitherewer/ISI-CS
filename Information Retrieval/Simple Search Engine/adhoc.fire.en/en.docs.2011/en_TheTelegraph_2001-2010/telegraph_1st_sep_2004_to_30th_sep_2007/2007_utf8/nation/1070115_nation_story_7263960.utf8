 Mittal millions to pull Labour out of red

 AMIT ROY

 Mittal

 London, Jan. 14: Lakshmi Mittal is preparing to bail out Labour by pledging 2 million to save the party from financial ruin after the cash-for-honours scandal, it was reported today.

 The Sunday Times said that the donation from Lakshmi Mittal, an Indian-born billionaire, will help Labour to pay off huge loans it controversially took from wealthy businessmen before the last general election.

 Publication of the story on the front page might embarrass both Mittal and the Labour Party, which is sensitive about financial assistance given by wealthy businessmen, especially Indians.

 It has become almost a clich to describe Mittal as the richest man in Britain with a personal fortune in excess of 14 billion.

 Only two weeks ago, the Indian steel tycoon received the ultimate accolade from The Sunday Times which announced: Lakshmi Mittal richly deserves to be the Sunday Times Business Person of 2006 after his audacious hostile takeover of Arcelor.

 However, todays report is confusing in an important respect. The paper does not make it clear whether the 2- million figure mentioned today is new money or old.

 Back in the summer of 2005, as was widely reported at the time, Mittal announced he was giving 2 million.

 In 2001, he had given Labour 125,000. This came out when he was negotiating the purchase of a steel plant in Romania. The donation became the subject of a huge controversy after it was disclosed that Tony Blair had written to the Rumanian government supporting Mittals bid.

 Mittal was angered when critics of Blair suggested the Prime Ministers support was given in return for the 125,000 donation. While Blairs letter may have done Mittals case no harm in the eyes of the Rumanians, the general feeling in the steel industry was that the Indian steel tycoon would have won, anyway.

 Mittal was completely open about his 2-million donation in 2005.

 I believe that the Labour party has made a significant and very positive impact on the overall prosperity of the United Kingdom since it came to office in 1997, he said in a statement. The party has set out long-term investment plans to further improve education, health, employment, skills and technology and I am supportive of the work it is doing in these fields.

 One source told The Telegraph today: The 2 million mentioned in The Sunday Times today is old money, which was pledged by Mittal. Perhaps he had not actually given the money and is now having his arm twisted.

 The Sunday Times said the 2-million deal is understood to have been negotiated by Tony Blair and Lord Levy, Labours chief fundraiser, who is on bail after being arrested in the summer.

 The paper added: The money is also likely to attract criticism from Labour backbenchers concerned about Blairs apparent financial reliance on a few millionaire backers and on Levy. Blair had hoped the 2-million gift would remain confidential until May, when the Electoral Commission discloses all donations received by political parties in the first three months of 2007.

 It also commented: Senior party figures are now worried that disclosure of Mittals pledge may lead him to withdraw it.

 It pointed out: Levy had stopped fundraising after the furore caused by the disclosure that Labour had secretly taken loans from wealthy businessmen to fund the last general election. However, the Prime Minister is thought to have turned to Levy as the partys debts have risen to almost 23 million.

 The paper quoted a Labour Party spokesman as saying: Mr Mittal has been a committed supporter of the party for many years, and any financial gift from one of the worlds most successful businessmen is very welcome.

 Mittal cannot be accused of giving the 2 million because he wants a peerage. As someone who says he is proud to retain his Indian passport, he would not normally expect to become a member of the British House of Lords.

 On the other hand, the law on his eligibility is unclear. Some believe he cannot qualify, though some of Mittals own lawyers checked the traditions and came to the opposite view.

 Mittal may well be a Labour Party supporter, though those who know him do not feel he is that interested in politics. But as a businessman, he may well ponder the wisdom of giving 2 million to Labour if it is the Tories, under David Cameron, who win the next election. He may need a bit of persuasion to fulfil the promise he made in 2005.

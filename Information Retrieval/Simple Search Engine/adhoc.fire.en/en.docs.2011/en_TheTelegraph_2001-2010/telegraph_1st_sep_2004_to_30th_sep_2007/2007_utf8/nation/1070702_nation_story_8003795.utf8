 Mumbai, July 1: Sangita Susvirkar and her seven-year-old daughter Disha spent much of Saturday perched on a slab in their flooded Lower Parel home. Chances are she will have to get back there on Monday and maybe, even Tuesday.

 After the Saturday salvo, Mumbai is bracing for a Monday mayhem. The rain respite today, a Sunday when not many ventured out, came with grim forecasts from the Met office of a downpour over the next two days.

 With little overnight rain, water had begun receding from several areas. But not many were smiling yet, lest the weathermans predictions come true on Monday, when office-goers will cram into trains and buses.

 I will come back only when the monsoon is over, I cant take a chance with my family. Most of us are taking essentials with us and moving in with our friends and relatives, said a resident of a 27-year-old building in Malad, rattled by fears that the structure might cave in.

 He was luckier than those in Indira Nagar, a flood-prone area in Kurla along the banks of the Mithi, where around 1,500 people were shifted to nearby madarsas.

 The saris kept at the bottom of the shelf were ruined when water surged in yesterday. The rains have stopped now and we are cleaning the place, said a Borivli shopkeeper, adding that he feared more problems tomorrow.

 Today, 6.1mm of rainfall was recorded in Colaba, in south Mumbai, and 21.3mm in the north-western suburb of Santa Cruz. 

 On Saturday, the rainfall was 288mm far less than the July 26, 2005, figure of 944mm that caused the great deluge but among the heaviest downpours this season. Municipal workers are struggling to drain out water.

 The casualties in all of Maharashtra over the weekend touched 45, with seven deaths reported from Mumbai yesterday. About 5,000 people were shifted to safer areas.

 Luckily, the airport was free from waterlogging in 2005, services were off for days which ensured flights ran smoothly, barring some delays. 

 Trains were on track today, though delays of about 15 minutes were reported on some routes, like the Central line. Many low-lying areas of the city are along this network. Southern Railway rescheduled some of its services to Mumbai today and warned of similar steps on Monday.

 Torrential rains have delayed admissions in city colleges as dozens of students couldnt submit applications for entry to intermediate courses within the Saturday deadline. They have been given time till 5pm on Monday.

 Panthnirapeksh: Panth means sect. The Constitution uses this word, but the RSS gives it a twist to suggest Islam and Christianity are mere sects and Hinduism is the

only religion 

 Dharmnirapeksh: Now

commonly used by secular parties

 Fei zhong jiao: Chinese

equivalent. It means non-religion

 Laicite: French word, like the English original, means separation of state and religion

 Loukik: Anandoram Borooahs Sanskrit dictionary uses this. In the sense of temporal as opposed to divine, its close to the English original

 New Delhi, Feb. 23: To him, Gods many names in many languages may be equally valid. But the secularist draws the line when it comes to his own credo.

 So, just a hint of hanky-panky in the translation of secular had Sitaram Yechury cocking his ears in Parliament today.

 The President had just finished his rather routine address to a joint sitting, and the Hindi translation was being read out a job that to everyones relief is confined to the first and last paragraphs.

 The demon lurked in the last line of the first paragraph that spoke of the countrys commitment to building a strong, modern, inclusive, secular and dynamic India.

 Only, someone in the cabinet secretariat had translated secular as panthnirapeksh instead of the more common dharmnirapeksh.

 Panth means sect. This is the language the RSS uses to underline that Hinduism is a religion and the rest like Christianity and Islam are sects, Yechury said.

 Heres where one might have quoted Shakespeare -- but secular is not like any other name. Its the benchmark that divides Indian politics into two camps. More crucially, its the call to arms that hinges Yechurys party to the Congress, allowing the government in Delhi to survive.

 Kalam

We are supporting the government to keep the communal forces out, but the President in his Hindi translation uses panthnirapeksh, Yechury shook his head.

 Yechury may not have known, but even the Constitution uses panthnirapeksh, experts said. In the mid-1970s, when Indira Gandhi was amending the Constitution to include socialist and secular in the Preamble, there was a debate over the right translation of the second word. Panthanirapeksh beat sampradaynirapeksh to the honour, with dharmnirapeksh not even in the picture.

 But the RSS has given panthnirapeksh a twist, implying all religions with one founder and one holy book are panths on a par with the various Hindu sects while Hinduism alone is dharm (religion).

 The Hindi translation, though, would have been cleared by the cabinet.

 Communists such as Yechury are atheists, but the realities of Indian politics have forced them to learn the nuances of language in a field they would normally have been dismissive about. China, the sole surviving communist superpower, doesnt even have an expression for secularism. The closest is fei zhong jiao.

 It means non-religion, said Manoranjan Mohanty, expert in Chinese studies.

 France has laicite which like the original English refers to the separation of state and religion.

 The 70s debate had arisen because Sanskrit doesnt have a word for the concept that wasnt born when it was a living language in India. Anandoram Borooahs authoritative 1877 Sanskrit dictionary translates secular as loukik (this-worldly).

 Yechury may not have time for such hair-splitting, but his hands are tied. The CPM leader today acknowledged that amendments cannot be moved to a translation.

 Hungry for votes, fast over booze

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Will it flow?

 Ahmedabad, Jan. 30: Shankersinh Vaghela today began a 52-hour fast on a highly emotive issue for Gujarat relaxation in the prohibition policy possibly to explore if the Assembly elections could be fought on this issue. 

 The Congress, which has been on the lookout for a credible issue for the elections, was careful to ensure that the mobilisation looked like a citizens initiative rather than a party programme. 

 Preparing the ground for battle with one-time protg Narendra Modi, the Union textile minister led a impressive silent march from Kocharab Ashram Paldi to Sabarmati Ashram garlanding the statues of Sardar Patel, Vivekananda and Mahatma Gandhi on the way. 

 On his return from South Africa, Gandhi had first set up his ashram at Kocharab, Paldi, before shifting to the bank of the Sabarmati from where he led the freedom movement.

 The Sabarmati Ashram was humming with activity today. Minutes before a prayer meeting at Hriday Kunj, where Gandhi used to stay until March 1930, Vaghela appeared unhappy over the lukewarm response he received from religious leaders he expected would join the fast.

 But most of them are close to chief minister Modi, who recently relaxed prohibition for special economic zones (SEZ) in the countrys only dry state, and did not turn up. 

 The former chief minister the only Congress leader seen as a match to Modi in Gujarat who had invited religious leaders to join him today thundered: What is preventing these sadhus and saints from coming out in the open to oppose Modis decision on prohibition?

 Warning them not to become sarkari sadhus and stressing this government would not last forever, Vaghela said no religious scriptures endorsed consumption of liquor. If that is so, why are these sadhus hiding? Why cannot they come out and lead this protest? he asked. 

 Former Gujarat Speaker Kundanlal Dholakia, 86, described the BJP governments decision to relax prohibition as an unpardonable sin. The chief minister had stabbed Gandhiji by taking this step, he said. 

 Gandhian Chhuni Vaidya, 90, of the Gujarat Lok Samiti and a fierce critic of Modi, questioned the autocratic decision. 

 Why did Modi not take people into confidence before taking such a step, he asked. 

 If Modi was so confident about his good judgement, why did he not hold a referendum on the issue which is so important from the point of view of youths, women and children, he added, challenging the chief minister to face the electorate on the issue of prohibition. 

 Although the religious leaders did not come, Vaghela was joined by womens organisations, NGOs and Gandhians who intend to intensify the protest.

 Badal snubs Delhi on sacked cop

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, April 15: Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal has refused to send former police chief S.S. Virk back to Maharashtra as directed by the Centre.

 The face-off is the first between the newly elected Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP government in the state and the Congress-led Union government.

 Virk was suspended on April 4 after a police probe linked him to a land scam worth crores of rupees, in which a war widow had allegedly been duped. The Union home ministry had on Wednesday asked the government to repatriate Virk to Maharashtra, his parent cadre, with immediate effect.

 The officers 20-year deputation to Punjab ends on May 31. Known to be close to former chief minister Amarinder Singh, Virk was removed from the police chiefs post by the Election Commission in January after Opposition parties raised concerns over his credibility and neutrality during the state polls. 

 Virk had in a letter to the Centre on March 5 expressed his desire to go back to Maharashtra, citing fears of ill-treatment by the new government in Punjab. 

 But Badal said on Thursday: Virk is under suspension. It will hamper investigations if he is sent back to Maharashtra.

 Land consent must for SEZ

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, July 23: The Centre has told state governments not to forcibly acquire land for special economic zones, Union commerce secretary G.K. Pillai said here today.

 We have clearly told the states that all land acquisition (for the special zones) should be by consent and not by compulsion, Pillai told a seminar on SEZs: Prospects and Challenges.

 If even one person is not willing to give up his or her land, it will not be notified by the commerce ministry.

 He said of the 49,000 hectares acquired by the various state industrial development corporations for SEZs, only a minuscule part was farmland. There was no reason to fear for Indias food security, Pillai added.

 Of the 362 special economic zones the ministry has formally approved in the country, land is yet to be notified for 229. Of the 133 notified SEZs, nearly 75 have already brought in foreign direct investment (FDI) of about Rs 43,123 crore, providing direct employment to 35,053 people, Pillai said.

 By the end of this year, we expect investments in SEZs to jump to Rs 100,000 crore and generate one lakh jobs.

 He said the initial rush for information technology SEZs was now giving way to proposals for multi-product special economic zones. This, he hoped, would boost the manufacturing industry.

 Pillai said eastern India now accounts for 14 per cent of all cleared SEZ proposals, in contrast to its earlier 6per cent share. Bengal and Orissa had done very well and the first multi-product SEZ for Nagaland was approved recently, and only Bihar and some northeastern states were lagging.

 The souths share had fallen from 47 per cent to 24 per cent while the west continued to account for 32 per cent.

 Pillai said the commerce ministry was waiting for the findings of a study commissioned by the finance ministry on revenue losses from tax exemptions given in SEZs.

 A preliminary study by the commerce ministry has shown the revenue loss was about Rs 48,000 crore, Pillai said, but the net earnings from SEZs would still be Rs 50,000 crore.

 The government is not thinking of a cap on infotech SEZs, Pillai said. The SEZ policy has been working well, although it would require a lot of changes as we go along. 

 Freight corridor

 India is expected to sign a memorandum of understanding with Japan for setting up a freight corridor connecting Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta, a top official said. 

 We are likely to sign it next month when the Japanese Prime Minister visits India, G.K. Pillai, secretary, ministry of commerce, told reporters on the sidelines of a seminar in Chennai.

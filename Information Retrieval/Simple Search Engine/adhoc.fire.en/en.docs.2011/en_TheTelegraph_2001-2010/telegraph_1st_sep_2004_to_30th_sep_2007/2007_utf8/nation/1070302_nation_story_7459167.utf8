 Heads or tails, Left sulks

 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

 Karat, Chidambaram 

 For a change, P. Chidambaram may have hoped to win the hearts of the Left, which loves to hate him. His budget answered the Marxists call for more light and more funds for the social sector, which, they had cribbed, was being pushed into the shadows by market mania. But he seemed to have looked for sympathy from the wrong quarters. 

 The allocations for education, health care, minorities and the economically backward sections should have given the Left some cause for cheer. That the budget had a political character may have upset the market, but the Marxists should have welcomed it. It is no secret that of all the movers of economic reforms, they dislike Chidambaram the most. But this budget actually came closest in many years to accommodating the Lefts wish list.

 This should be clear if one reads the budget proposals alongside the long note the four Left parties sent to Chidambaram on February 2. As in any such proposal, whether from a political party or a chamber of commerce, there are demands in the note that are more routine than realistic. There was the old rhetoric that advised him to raise resources by taxing the corporates and the rich. But the finance minister seems to have done many of the things the Left wanted him to do.

 It wanted the governments expenditure to increase to 6 per cent of the GDP on education and to 2 or 3 per cent of the GDP on health care. It put a special emphasis on Sarva Siksha Abhiyan. The finance minister has raised the allocation for education by 34.2 per cent over the previous year and that for health and family planning by 21.9 per cent, and has focused on the Abhiyan. Better still, he offered a new scheme to check school dropout rates and promised to launch a recruitment drive for schoolteachers. 

 The note also wanted more funds for housing, jobs and other amenities for the minorities, Dalits and Adivasis. Chidambaram mentioned the Sachar Committee report and offered substantial budgetary provisions for the disadvantaged groups. Many of the rural job-generating schemes that have been the Lefts pet projects also got his approving nod.

 The other major demand was on futures trading in agricultural commodities. Chidambaram went a long way to meet it by banning the launch of new future contracts for wheat and rice and by setting up a committee to study the impact of commodity future markets on prices. 

 True, the Left does not buy the theory that the current rate of inflation is a result of high growth. In an editorial in Peoples Democracy a week before the Union budget, the CPM cites the Chinese example. The Chinese economy has been registering rapid growth for three decades. Inflation is currently below 2 per cent in China, it says. It is another matter that many economists doubt the official Chinese figures for inflation. 

 There are areas, though, such as agriculture where the Lefts wish was not fulfilled. But many others have had similar complaints about the allocation for farming. 

 Ultimately, the Lefts reasons for protest seem to be more political than economic. Rising prices, the Congresss poll defeat in Punjab and Uttarakhand, another round of fight on pension, banking and insurance reforms during the budget session of Parliament and other compulsions make it a season of shadow-boxing for the Marxists. A rejuvenated BJP will be raring to have a go at the government. The time is just ripe for the Left to play the protester, never mind if it also supports the government.

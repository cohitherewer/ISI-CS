The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Small towns on IT map

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 29: Calcutta is logged into the IT boom, but more Bengal towns are waiting to become byte bastions.

 A report has ranked Kalyani, Siliguri, Durgapur, Kharagpur and Haldia as the places most suitable for IT investments. 

 The PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) study has also concluded that it is 20 per cent cheaper to develop these towns as vibrant infotech destinations than similar places elsewhere in the country.

 The study by the global consultant on behalf of the states IT department says Siliguri couldnt grab the top spot as its airport, about 15km away in Bagdogra, does not have night-landing facilities.

 Two IT parks, of 25 acres each, are being set up in Siliguri and Durgapur. Their developers can apply for recognition as a special economic zone later, said Siddharth, principal secretary in the IT department. The development authorities in the two towns have already set the ball rolling on the formalities to invite developers.

 Kalyani scored over Siliguri because it is only an hour away from the Calcutta airport. The Belghoria expressway connecting the town to Calcutta helped put it to the top of the rankings. 

 Around 30 acres are earmarked in Kalyani for IT development. The department has asked for around 200 acres, saying the land can be given to IT parks and other firms waiting for allotments.

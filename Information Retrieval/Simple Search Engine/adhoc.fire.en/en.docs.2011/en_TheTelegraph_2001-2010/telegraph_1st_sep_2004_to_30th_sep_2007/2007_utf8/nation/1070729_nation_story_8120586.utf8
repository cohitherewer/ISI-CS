The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 India climbs happiness chart

 Optimistic

 Silicon Valley, July 28 (PTI): Indians are markedly happier and optimistic today than five years ago, a survey on global opinion has said. 

 The survey, by the Pew Global Attitudes project in about 47 nations, shows that increasing contentment in India and some other developing nations, including China, is clearly correlated with sizeable increases in per capita gross domestic product (GDP) that has far outpaced the rate of growth prior to 2002. 

 Over the last five years, per capita GDP in India rose by 38 per cent and the percentage of people expressing satisfaction with life has grown from 29 per cent to 41 per cent. 

 The Chinese are more likely than people from any other nation to say they are better off now than five years ago, perhaps reflecting the countrys tremendous economic growth in recent years, the survey said. Roughly six in 10 Chinese believe their lives have improved, compared with only 42 per cent five years ago. 

 In contrast, levels of personal contentment and satisfaction with annual income have been much more stable in North America, western Europe and Japan, where income growth has been less impressive. 

 Also, unlike the developing countries, satisfaction with national conditions is flat or has declined in most advanced nations where trends are available. 

 According to the survey, trends in opinion about the course of ones country are also closely correlated with changing economic fortunes. 

 In India, a significantly higher number of people are satisfied with the state of the country now 42 per cent versus 7 per cent in 2002, though evaluations of the government and national leadership have remained fairly stable at 77 per cent in 2007. 

 Similarly, about seven in 10 Indians are more upbeat about the countrys economy, compared with 39 per cent in 2002.

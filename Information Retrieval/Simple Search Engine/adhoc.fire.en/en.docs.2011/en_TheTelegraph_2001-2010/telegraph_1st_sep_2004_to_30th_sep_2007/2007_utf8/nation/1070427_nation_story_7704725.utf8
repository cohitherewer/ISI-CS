 Court rap on Calcutta roads

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 26: Calcutta High Court today expressed serious concern over the poor maintenance of some roads with tram tracks. 

 The condition of the Shyambazar Five-Point Crossing and RG Kar Road in north Calcutta is terrible. These roads need immediate repair, the division bench said. 

 Justices P.C. Ghosh and B. Somadder also came down heavily on a high court-appointed committee for not carrying out its earlier order. 

 On March 21, the court had asked the committee to inspect the roads with tram tracks and file a report on their condition on the next hearing in the case. 

 More than a month has passed, but the committee has not filed its report, the bench observed as the matter came up for hearing. 

 Advocate Idris Ali, on behalf of the committee, cited the delay in getting a copy of the court order as the reason behind the missed deadline. 

 The judges then asked the court officer to immediately issue a copy of the order to the five-member committee. We will take up the matter again on May 14 and the committee will have to file its report on the condition of the roads by then.

 Eat fish for a brainy baby

 New Delhi. Feb. 16: Pregnant women who avoid seafood are more likely to have children who score poorly on intelligence quotient (IQ) tests than children born to women who regularly consumed seafood, a new study has shown.

 The study conducted in the UK has bolstered long-held views about the role of fish in brain development and indicated that the benefits of seafood outweigh potential risks associated with ingesting mercury through contaminated fish. Several studies in the past have shown that seafood contains omega-3 fatty acids that help in the development of the foetal brain. 

 Now, epidemiologist Jean Golding at the University of Bristol in the UK and her colleagues in the US have shown that the lower the intake of seafood during pregnancy, the higher is the risk of less than optimal brain development.

 Women who are expecting but do not consume seafood should consider taking nutritional supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids, Golding from Bristols community medicine department told The Telegraph in a telephone interview. The University of Bristol researchers analysed the cognitive skills and behaviour of children born to several thousand women who were pregnant during 1991-92. 

 Reporting their findings today in the journal Lancet, they said that low maternal seafood intake was associated with relatively lower scores in IQ, fine motor skills, communication and social development tests. 

 The differences in scores were most stark in verbal IQ tests. While 31 per cent of children of women who consumed no seafood scored low on verbal IQ tests at eight years of age, this figure was 22 per cent among children whose mothers had consumed 340 gm fish per week, and only 17 per cent among children whose mothers had eaten more than 340 gm per week. 

 The findings suggest maternal consumption of more than 340 gm about three portions of seafood per week was beneficial for the development of the foetal brain, Golding said. The researchers asked the mothers whether they ate white fish (cod, haddock, plaice), dark fish (tuna, sardines, mackerel, kippers, trout, salmon), or shellfish (prawns or crabs), but did not analyse the species or portions eaten.

 The study assumes significance because it comes three years after two US government agencies issued advisories that pregnant women should restrict their overall consumption of seafood to 340 gm per week. 

 The advisories were based on concerns that seafood may be contaminated with mercury and and restricting seafood consumption would thus reduce the chance of exposing foetuses to mercury, Golding said. But the studies showing mercury contamination were based on observations on islands where the population consumed only whale meat and whales have high mercury levels, she said. 

 The new findings show that the risks from the loss of important nutrients resulting from avoiding seafood were greater than the risks of harm from exposure to trace contaminants in 340 gm seafood eaten each week.

 French teacher in rape video scandal

 Bangalore, Aug. 7: A Bengali teacher of French has been accused of raping a woman for two days and three nights and video-graphing the acts, claiming to be replicating scenes from French films.

 Bangalore police today arrested Sourav Bose, 34, a tutor with Alliance Francaise and believed to be the scion of a family that owns a south Calcutta cinema.

 He claims to be an aspiring film-maker, influenced heavily by French cinema, and says several Calcutta newspapers had interviewed him.

 The 24-year-old woman, a Bengali adopted by a Frenchman, alleged Bose also beat her with his belt and clicked her in the nude with his cellphone camera at knife-point.

 The police said they had found the video files in Boses laptop but added the woman seemed to be smiling into the camera in several scenes.

 Bose claimed the sex was consensual. The woman is involved in a project at Alliance Francaise, which the accused joined two months ago.

 She loves me but her family doesnt like me, so she is being forced to complain to the police, he told journalists during his arrest from his Kodihalli apartment, the alleged scene of the crime.

 He explained he had beaten the woman in a fit of rage after an argument on the person she was seeing.

 Officers, however, said they had found obscene videos of Bose and other women, too, in his laptop and video camera, and a large collection of pornographic CDs at his home.

 Bose had been in France from 2000 till 2006, studying mass communication at Rennes. 

 He returned to Calcutta briefly before taking up a translators job at a Bangalore call centre, and then joined Alliance Francaise.

 At times, Bose tells the police he loves the woman deeply; at other times, he says she is not the only one. I like the French way of life I keep changing girlfriends, he told a surprised officer.

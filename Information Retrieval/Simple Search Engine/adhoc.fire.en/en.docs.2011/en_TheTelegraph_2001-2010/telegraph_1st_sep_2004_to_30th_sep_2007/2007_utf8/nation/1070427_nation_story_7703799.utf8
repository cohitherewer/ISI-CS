 Ive caught him, hes my neighbour: Amitabh

 SUBHASH K. JHA 

 The picture of the Aishwarya-Abhishek wedding 

 Mumbai, April 26: One of the greatest mysteries of recent times has been solved: the neighbour did it.

 An angry Amitabh Bachchan has cracked the puzzle behind how the wedding pictures of Abhishek and Aishwarya have made it to the public domain before the official release.

 Thats because some of the people who came to the wedding surreptitiously took photographs with their mobile cameras and disgracefully put them on the Net. In fact, Ive caught out the person who has taken the photographs. Hes my neighbour, Bachchan fumed. 

 Ive had a very serious talk with him. He has apologised profusely. He says he wasnt giving it to the press. While he was sending the pictures to his sister in the US, they got intercepted on the Net.

 Its an argument the angry father of the groom who went to great lengths to shut out the world from the big Bollywood wedding last week some media photographers were beaten up badly by the security guards and one ended up in hospital is not buying.

 I dont believe it. But Id like to. Hes my neighbour. I cant believe your neighbour could be guilty of such an act of betrayal. Anyway, we will give photographs to the media officially.

 The iron curtain was a big talking point of the wedding but the guest list and those left out of it, which included most Bollywood A-listers like Shah Rukh, Saif and Salman Khan, Hrithik Roshan and Rani Mukerji upstaged it. 

 I dont think sections of the media have the right to dictate to me about how to conduct my life and how to deal with my family and social obligations. My familys privacy is very important to me. Ill protect it with my dying breath. 

 The actor cannot see what all the fuss is about, especially when everyone got cards.

 We had two kinds of cards made for the wedding. One was the wedding card and the other is the information card. It informs about the wedding with a shagun and mithai and asks everyone to bless the couple. Weve sent this card to everyone, in the film industry, the political circles because of Amar Singhji and Jaya, and whoever has been a part of our lives. Even after all this if some people choose to be hurt, what can we say?

 Colleagues could be cut up but the family is happy, enjoying time together at their bungalow Jalsa. I know this bliss is short-lived. I wish I could spend more time with Aishwarya. But we all have to get back to work soon. But the family is feeling so much happier. 

 Aishwarya and Abhishek are leaving early tomorrow morning for France for their honeymoon, adds PTI.

 Bachchan admits that as one of the countrys best-known film stars, he could sometimes draw attention. 

 I cannot deny the attention which comes with the VIP label. The media is free to do what it wants. But you cant block my car when Im taking my new daughter-in-law home after the wedding. Why spoil the most important moment in my son and his wifes life? 

 Bachchan is back to playing the injured celebrity. We took all the relevant permissions from the civic authorities. They wanted a full guest list, the ceremonies, everything. 

 We gave them all the details. We made the shamianas air-conditioned and soundproof for the comfort of the guests and so that people outside wouldnt get disturbed. We had no fireworks to avoid sound pollution. Subhash, weve done everything to make sure no one is offended in any way.

 If bitter comments are still being made about us in spite of our best intentions, what can I say?

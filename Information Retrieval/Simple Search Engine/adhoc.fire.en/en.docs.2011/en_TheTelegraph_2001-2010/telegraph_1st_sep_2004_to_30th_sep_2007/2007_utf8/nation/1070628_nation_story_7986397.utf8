 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Out of Kyunki, but Tulsi rules

 She might be out of Indias most widely watched soap, but that has hardly stopped her from working up a lather.

 Such was Smriti Iranis appeal as Tulsi in Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi that the TV star has been invited to play a central role at a charity event in Sri Lanka.

 Smriti will be in Colombo in July as part of a project launched by a local television channel, Sirasa TV, which airs the Sinhalese version of Kyunki. 

 She will be the star guest during a campaign by the Lankan TV company to donate low-cost homes to the poor.

 But meeting fans and joining Sirasas anniversary celebrations will not be the only things that will keep Irani occupied. Mixing some business with her pleasure trip, she will hold talks to produce content for the channel.

 The actress owns a production house, which has serials like Viruddh and Thodi Si Zameen flooring audiences. 

 Eye on womens cell cops

 All offices of the crimes against women section of Delhi police will soon be wired with closed- circuit television to record any harassment victims face at the hands of the men in khaki. 

 The move comes after a series of complaints from individuals and womens rights groups claiming that officers of the section often seek favours, and are biased in their attitude against women. 

 The rooms of all 200 Delhi police officers who deal with crimes against women will have CCTVs centrally controlled by the office of assistant commissioner Tejinder Luthra, who heads the special cell.

 The CCTVs, police say, will also help in case key witnesses turn hostile or the accused go back on a confession. 

 Jobs rain on tech address

 A hot new address in Chennai might give the countrys top technology schools a run for their campus placements.

 VIT University saw 789 of its students being picked by Tata Consultancy Services, the largest Indian IT firm. The number, which is twice the companys intake last year, was a record of sorts for the Vellore institute.

 Of the 1,500 B.Tech and M.Tech students who took away appointment letters after campus interviews, the percentage of girls was higher, a trend seen in the past few years.

 Chancellor G. Vishwanathan says the preference shown by blue-chip companies for VIT students reflects the high level of proficiency acquired during their courses. This includes software skills and a strong theoretical grounding. 

 Other than state-of-the-art labs and computers, the institute also organises lectures by successful entrepreneurs, especially those with start-up ventures.

 Water woes

 Many in Mumbai might be wading to work and back during the monsoons, but the citys tap troubles show no signs flowing away.

 Last week, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai said the 20 per cent water cut now in force will continue at least till June 30. Things could get better after that, but only if assessments show the rain-fed lakes supplying water to the city are full.

 According to municipal commissioner Jairaj Phatak, the rains so far have been insufficient to fill the water bodies. 

 Clearly, the citys water woes are spilling over whether its a deficit or an excess.

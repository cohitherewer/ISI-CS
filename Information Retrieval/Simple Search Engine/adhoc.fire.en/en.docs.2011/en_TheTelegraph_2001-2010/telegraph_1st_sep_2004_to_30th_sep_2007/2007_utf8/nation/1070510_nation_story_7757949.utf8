 Mumbai, May 9: Sanjay Dutt had a disappointing day in court today as judge Pramod Kode deferred the decision on his probation plea.

 Kode said he would give his order on May 16 but keep it confidential till May 18, when he is set to begin the sentencing of all the accused in the 1993 blasts case.

 Dutt and his friends Yusuf Nulwalla, Russi Mulla and Kersi Adajania have sought their release under the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, on the ground of good conduct. If the judge rules in their favour, their sentence will be suspended and their conduct monitored by a probation officer appointed by the anti-terror court.

 However, one of the actors friends walked out of the court smiling. Ajay Marwah was among the 23 accused formally acquitted today.

 Among those acquitted were three members of prime accused Tiger Memons family mother Hanifa, brother Suleiman and sister-in-law Raheen. 

 Marwah has been acquitted of the charge of hiding a 9-mm pistol belonging to Dutt. God has blessed me. I hope Sanju, too, will be set free, he said.

 Freedom brought tears to Ismail Patels eyes. By the grace of Allah, good has happened, but it has come 14 years too late. My status in society suffered, and I have lost a lot of money, said Patel, who was accused of arranging funds for arms training of conspirators in Pakistan.

 Bitterness was more apparent in Abdul Aziz Shaikhs voice. In his early 60s, he has been acquitted of the charge of taking arms training in Pakistan. For 14 years, I have suffered. What am I going to do now? I will have to start a new life, he said.

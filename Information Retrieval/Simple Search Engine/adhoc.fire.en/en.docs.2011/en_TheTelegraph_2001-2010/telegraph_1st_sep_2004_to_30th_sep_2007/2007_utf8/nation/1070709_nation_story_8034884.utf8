 Third eye on BEST bus

 SATISH NANDGAONKAR

 Mumbai, July 8: As the city mourns its 7/11 victims, BEST will roll out the first fleet of buses wired with closed-circuit cameras. The 100 buses will drive out of the Wadala depot on Wednesday, the first anniversary of the serial train blasts.

 This will provide enhanced security to our passengers and allow us to effectively monitor the entire bus, said Uttam Khobragade, general manager, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking (BEST).

 Three cameras at the entrance, the exit and the middle of the bus will monitor passenger movement, and store the footage in a black box.

 Khobragade said the decision to wire the buses with the cameras was taken after the 2002-03 explosions on two BEST buses in suburban Ghatkopar.

 The CCTV footage will be a permanent record on a hard disk, and could be useful for police in identifying suspects in case of a terror attack. It can also prove to be a deterrent for crimes like eve-teasing and pick-pocketing.

 Apart from the cameras, the buses will be fitted with LCD screens, where pre-recorded public service information can be displayed.

 At the moment, we do not have the technology to telecast information live. So, it will be largely used for messages and other pre-recorded information, Khobragade said. 

 Although initially only 100 buses will be fitted with the cameras and the LCD screens, these facilities will be extended to cover our entire fleet, he said. 

 The LCD screens and camera network are part of a new contract awarded by the BEST recently to a private firm as a revenue-enhancing measure.

 The cameras have cost us nothing. It is part of a move to increase revenues and BEST aims to generate revenue of up to Rs 1crore per year through advertising, he said.

 Since last year, the BEST has installed coin-operated payphones and mobile bill collection boxes that are not only useful for passengers but also help increase revenue.

 The undertaking operates a total of 3,400 buses, ferrying 4.5 million passengers on 340 routes.

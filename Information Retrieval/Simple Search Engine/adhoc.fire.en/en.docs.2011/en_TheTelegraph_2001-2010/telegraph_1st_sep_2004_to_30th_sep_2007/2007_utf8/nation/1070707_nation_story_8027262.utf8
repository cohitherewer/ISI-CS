The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Taj or not, Bipasha on top of world

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Taj Mahal: Awaiting Wonder nod

 Calcutta, July 6: She has lost all her luggage but that has not stopped Bipasha Basu from having a blast in Lisbon. 

 And why not? With Sir Ben Kingsley and Hilary Swank for company, the Beedi babe is on top of the world as she gets ready to co-host the official ceremony tomorrow at Estadio da Luz to announce the New Seven Wonders of the World.

 I am very excited to be here, Bipasha told The Telegraph from Lisbon. Sir Ben was very sweet and nice. I just got the script for tomorrows show and will rehearse it now. Yes, everythings good except the lost luggage.

 Taj Mahal is in the race with 20 other architectural masterpieces across the world including the Acropolis of Athens, Angkor Wat in Cambodia, Colosseum in Rome, Eiffel Tower in Paris, Great Wall of China, Pyramids of Giza, Statue of Liberty in New York and Sydney Opera House to be listed in the New Seven Wonders of the World.

 But Bipasha believes thats not why she is there. I know there is a perception that I have been chosen as a host because Taj Mahal has been nominated but that is not the case, she said. 

 I am here because of the person I am. Hilary Swank is representing the American faculty of actors, Sir Ben is representing the British faculty of actors and I am here as the Indian film representative. 

 All have been picked because of their personalities and nothing else. I do not want to put any pressure on me by thinking what will happen to me if the Taj doesnt become a Wonder.

 Present at the glittering ceremony tomorrow (2 in the morning on Sunday for India) will be astronaut Neil Armstrong, footballer Cristiano Ronaldo and balloonist Bertrand Piccard. Chaka Khan and Jennifer Lopez are among those who will perform at the ceremony.

 Despite the marketing blitzkrieg surrounding the Taj including a special anthem composed and performed by A.R. Rahman its appearance on the final list wont be easy considering the other heavyweights on the nomination list. 

 I just appeal to every Indian out there to keep voting for the Taj, Bipasha adds. Its only recently that people have started voting for it. I have no inside information as to where the Taj stands as of now. But it will be a shame if it doesnt make it to the final list. As for me, I will be a very proud Indian on stage if Taj Mahal does figure in the top seven.

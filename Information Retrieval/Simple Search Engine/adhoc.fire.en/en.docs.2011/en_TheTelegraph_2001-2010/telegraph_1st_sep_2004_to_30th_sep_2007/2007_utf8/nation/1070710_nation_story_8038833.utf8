 Mumbai, July 9: Eight crew members of an ONGC offshore supply vessel are missing since afternoon after it sank near Bombay High, about 100km from the coast.

 Nine persons were rescued by other ONGC vessels after the Samudrika-10 sank around 12.30pm, officials of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation said.

 According to initial reports, 14 were believed to be on board, but now the latest report indicates that there were 17 on board the vessel, and eight are still missing, Coast Guard Commandant Kalpit Dikshit told The Telegraph.

 According to a statement issued by the ONGC, Samudrika-10 was operating in the Bassein and Satellite field of the gas corporation.

 Three vessels and a helicopter were deployed for rescue operations immediately after authorities came to know that the vessel had sunk. 

 Then around 3pm, the navy dispatched Sea King helicopters which have more endurance, said naval spokesperson Commandant A.K. Lambhate.

 Dikshit said the exact reason behind the capsize is yet to be ascertained, but initial reports have revealed that the Samudrika-10s steering room was flooded.

 Top ONGC officials, including managing director R.S. Sharma and director, offshore, N. Mitra, were supervising the search and rescue operations, the officials said. 

 We have not lost hope and rescue operations are on. But we fear four to five people may be dead, Sharma told PTI.

 Although Samudrika-10 is owned by the ONGC, it was being operated by a private agency called Sical Logistics.

 Inspector-general A. Rajasekhar, commander, Coast Guard (west), said there was no oil spill. 

 The insured value of the vessel is likely to be in the range of $2 million to $3 million, an ONGC spokesperson said. The loss of Samudrika-10 will not have any significant impact on operations. 

 Sharma said Samudrika-10 was commissioned in 1986 and went for dry dock maintenance in February 2006. The next dry dock maintenance was scheduled in November 2008.

 The vessel had set sail on July 6 in sea-worthy condition.

 Other accidents have also occurred around Bombay High in the recent past. 

 On July 27, 2005, a day after the Mumbai deluge that paralysed the city, about a dozen people were killed when one of the ONGCs offshore platforms caught fire in the Bombay High region. 

 On August 11, 2003, a helicopter carrying ONGC personnel to the Bombay High region had crashed, killing 27 people.

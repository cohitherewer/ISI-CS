 New Delhi, Aug. 22: The USS Nimitz carrier strike group of the US Navy was today steaming towards the Bay of Bengal for the largest naval war game to be hosted in Indian waters.

 The USs senior-most military officer in the region was also expected here this evening to review the five-nation drill that the Left wants scrapped.

 Defence minister A.K. Antony met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and is understood to have briefed him on the war game and also on international military engagements. 

 The chief of navy staff, Admiral Sureesh Mehta, briefed Antony on the preparations today. 

 The nuclear-powered USS Nimitz and the USS Kitty Hawk are two of the three aircraft carriers to participate in Malabar-07-02. The third is the Indian Navys flagship, the INS Viraat. 

 The exercise is to be held in the waters off the east coast and to the west of the Andamans. Indian Air Force aircraft will operate from shore establishments for the drill. 

 The US Pacific Command chief, Admiral Timothy Keating, will be in India over the next three days, reviewing preparations and also getting an appreciation of Indian security perceptions in the Indian Ocean region. 

 Admiral Keating is expected to meet Antony and the chiefs of the armed forces during his visit. Details of his engagements were not released.

 There is a likelihood that the admiral will also visit the Eastern Command headquarters in Calcutta. Although Keating is a naval officer, he is at the apex of the US military command in the Asia-Pacific region. Pacom Pacific Command is the USs largest theatre command.

 The Left has demanded that the war game be put off and is organising protest rallies from Chennai and Calcutta to Visakhapatnam. Senior Left leaders have also, in conversations with foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and defence minister Antony over the last few days, sounded the governments intentions on the war game. 

 Defence ministry sources said the war game would not be cancelled or deferred. 

 The Indian Navy began preparations for the five-nation drill as early as October last year. About 20 warships including 13 from the US and others from Australia, Japan and Singapore will participate in the exercise. 

 But the Left sees in the war game and the India-US civilian nuclear deal a design to interlock a word used by CPM general secretary Prakash Karat India into a military system led by the US. 

 When the Nimitz came in in July, the Left described it as a symbol of American aggression against Iraq and Afghanistan. If it is still looking for such symbols in American warships, it can also look into the history of the Kitty Hawk.

 In the early 1970s, it was deployed off Vietnam in the war against the Viet Cong. Ho Chi Minhs communist forces drove away the American troops in what was the USs biggest military failure. But the US now counts Vietnam as one of its fast friends in Asia.

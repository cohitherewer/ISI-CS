 Bentley bother for Bachchan

 Delhi/Mumbai, Feb. 7: Cars may be the craze in Bollywood when it comes to gifts. But stars, look before you ride into the sunset.

 On a day Amitabh Bachchan got a Rs 3.5-crore Rolls Royce Phantom from director Vidhu Vinod Chopra for his stunning performance in Eklavya, another luxury car in the Bachchan stable seemed to be running into a spot of bother.

 The Delhi transport department might raise objections to the Rs 1.7-crore Bentley that Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh had imported for Abhishek Bachchan on his 31st birthday.

 The Bentley arrived in Delhi, and Singh transferred it to Mumbai. However, different addresses on the cars registration papers and on an application filed by Singh for a transit registration could land the Samajwadi leader in trouble.

 He seems to have ordered the car from his Delhi residence. That is the address on the cars registration papers, an official in the transport department said. 

 But Singhs application for transit registration mentions his address as Jalsa the name of the Bachchans bungalow in Mumbai. 

 For the transit registration to be given, the applicant needs to clarify what the real address is. Right now, there seems to be a contradiction, Delhi transport minister Haroon Yusuf said. 

 He was, however, tightlipped on whether the Delhi government was considering taking action against Singh. Let us see. We are still examining his papers.

 The sparkling white Bentley became the talk of the town after reports that Bachchan had gifted it to his son on Monday.

 But the actor denied the reports today. I have not gifted the Bentley to him, he said, refusing to add who Abhishek had got it from.

 If the Bentley screeched on a slippery road, the Rolls Royce gifted by Chopra roared in applause.

 Mr Bachchans performance is simply stunning in Eklavya and I felt such an accomplished performance deserves an extra special acknowledgement. And what better than a Rolls Royce for a person who has a passion for cars, the director said after handing over the keys to Bachchan at Janak, the actors office, in Juhu. 

 Hot wheels are a cool choice for gifts in Bollywood. 

 Shah Rukh had presented friend Farah Khan a Rs 24-lakh Hyundai Terracan when she made her directorial debut with Main Hoon Na. 

 Soon after, Yash Chopra bought an E-class Mercedes for Lata Mangeshkar as a token of his appreciation for her songs in Veer Zaara.

 Mercedes seems to be topping the stars gift list. 

 Salman had given one to Govinda, when the actor was down and out. Sidelined by the rest of the industry and in deep financial crisis after joining politics, Govinda was so touched on being offered a role in Salmans brother Sohails film Partner that he had refused to take money. That was when Salman hit upon the idea of paying him with a Merc, leaving Govinda speechless.

 When it comes to presents, Salman is known to be impulsive. Yesterday, he had invited half the visiting Sri Lankan cricket team home for dinner. After platefuls of biryani came the surprise sweet dish Rolex watches for all the guests. 

 Watches it seems are close on the heels of cars when it comes to Bollywood gifts. 

 Shah Rukh presented one a Rs 1 lakh-plus Tag Heuer to a KBC contestant when he lost and one each to all his Don co-stars.

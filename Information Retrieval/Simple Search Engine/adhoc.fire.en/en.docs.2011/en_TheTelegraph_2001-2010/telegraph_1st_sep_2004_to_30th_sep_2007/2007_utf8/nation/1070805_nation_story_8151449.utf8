 Family sits tight on Kafeel body claim

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 Kafeel

 Aug. 4: British authorities will be ready to hand over Kafeel Ahmeds body next week, Crown Office sources in London said today, but his parents in Bangalore still have no plans to go to Glasgow to claim it. 

 The London sources, without naming Kafeel, said the terror suspects remains could be handed over days from now after the post-mortem was over.

 In Bangalore, the Ahmeds lawyer, B.T. Venkatesh, said there was no way the family could claim the body till Britain officially confirmed the dead mans identity.

 UK police have only said the man who severely burnt himself during the failed June 30 car-bomb attack on Glasgow airport had died on Thursday night, refusing to name the Indian engineer probably because they had not charged him.

 Venkatesh rejected an agency report that said Kafeels mother, Dr Zakia Ahmed, had left for Glasgow. I spoke to her this afternoon and she did not express any desire to leave for Britain, the lawyer said.

 Bangalore police said they had recovered a second hard disk from the Ahmeds home and sent it to the Forensic Science Laboratory in Hyderabad. The first hard disk found in the house is believed to have coded information that is being deciphered by experts.

 Haneef friend

 Australian authorities may have begun a process to sack Indian doctor Mohammed Asif Ali, who worked with Mohammed Haneef at Queenslands Gold Coast Hospital, for alleged discrepancies in his curriculum vitae, a news report said today.

 The embellishments were uncovered during the investigation into terror charges against Haneef, who was released after 25 days in detention and returned to India last month. Asif now reportedly faces deportation.

 The Australian newspaper said the doctor is believed to have exaggerated his Indian work experience by three months and kept rubber stamps and letterheads in case he needed to forge documents to support his tweaked curriculum vitae.

 Asif reportedly told the Channel Seven network he had embellished his CV to gain work in Britain, where he accrued the experience to work in Australia.

 The Australian also reported that the countrys police chief, Mick Keelty, had rejected the widespread view that the case against Haneef had all but collapsed.

 Keelty told the newspaper he would track down every lead and piece of evidence against Haneef, adding that the terror investigation could take years to complete.

 He also revealed that British police were still involved in the joint investigation with Australian authorities on the Haneef case.

 NDA eyes ties for 2009

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 21: National Democratic Alliance leaders today described their meeting with the newly formed third front as an endeavour to give national politics a direction, but wouldnt say whether they would back front candidate A.P.J. Abdul Kalam for another term.

 They repeated that if the President agrees to contest, they would vote for him and said how gracious their candidate, Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, was by being the first to endorse Kalams candidacy once he had indicated he could be the fronts nominee.

 But there was no word on whether the NDA would call on Kalam to offer support.

 On its part, the front a club of former chief ministers who have come together under the banner United National Progressive Alliance refused to say if it would back Shekhawat in case it fails to rustle up the numbers for Kalam.

 Its stand so far is that Shekhawat, like UPA-Left-BSP nominee Pratibha Patil, is a political entity and, by implication, could divide the political establishment and check the emergence of a consensus for the high office.

 The NDA and the front will meet again tomorrow. But its apparent that while the BJP sees an opening for a larger alliance with the motley group of regional parties for the 2009 elections, the front leaders have confined their strategy to the presidential polls and getting Kalam a second term.

 Kalam is a national issue, he is not a political issue. We are carrying out a national mission because, during his term, Kalam had created new aspirations among youths and intellectuals said Telugu Desam leader N. Chandrababu Naidu, the fronts convener.

 After the NDA-front meeting in Atal Bihari Vajpayees residence this evening, BJP spokesperson Sushma Swaraj said the front leaders would explain the situation to Kalam tomorrow. If he agrees to contest, the NDA would vote for him.

 Sushma said they had not discussed a back-up plan with Naidu and Mulayam Singh Yadav or even brought up Shekhawats name. We dont want to place all our cards on the table, she added.

 BJP veteran Jaswant Singh, the leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, said the meeting was an encouraging sign. 

 The natural question then is, we should take it forward.

 The Shiv Sena skipped an NDA meeting this evening. Sources said until chief Bal Thackeray officially disclosed the partys stand on June 25, as he has promised, there was no point participating in the deliberations on the presidential poll.

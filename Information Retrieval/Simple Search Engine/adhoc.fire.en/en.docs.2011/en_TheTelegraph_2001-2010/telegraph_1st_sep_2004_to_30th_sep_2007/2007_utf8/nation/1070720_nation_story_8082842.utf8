 Mumbai, July 19: Neerja has been waiting at Bhagwati Hospital all night for news of her three-year-old niece Risha. She cant stop crying. Neerja has already lost her sister Vineeta in the Borivli building collapse.

 Each time an ambulance enters the building, Neerjas eyes light up, but in vain. 

 Risha has been trapped under the concrete rubble for over 12 hours. Each passing minute could mean death for her. 

 Thirty-five-year-old Neerja is not alone. Dozens of relatives of those trapped underneath the debris, once a wing of the Lakshmi Chhaya building in Borivli (west), have been on vigil near the building as also at the hospital.

 The relatives dread the white board in the hospital, where the names of the dead are being posted. Many were seen breaking down after a glance. 

 Twenty-eight people have died so far and 17 have been rescued. The police said among the dead are eight men, 13 women and five children. 

 The building had major renovations done to it only last year. We were to have a meeting in the evening to discuss the issue over the renovations being done on the premises of Varshaman Jewellery on the ground floor, a resident said. 

 People are alleging that it was this second renovation that led to the collapse.

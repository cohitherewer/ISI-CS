 Relief like childbirth

 Jamshedpur, Jan. 31: With Tata Steel finally acquiring Corus, there could probably be no better gift for the company during its centenary year. 

 The relief is like that of childbirth after a long-troubled pregnancy, said an official, summing up the mood in the company.

 While Tata Steel had planned a series of programmes leading to the centenary celebrations, officials said the revelry now would be on a more grand scale. 

 However, officials said it is too early to decide the nature of the celebrations. Let things settle down first, only then would the line of action be decided, said an official.

 As news of the acquisition trickled into various sections of the steel major, officials and workers began congratulating each other.

 Though the celebrations at the works were more formal, the mood near the gates leading to the steel plant was festive. Workers smeared gulal on each other and distributed sweets.

 Apart from becoming the fifth-largest producer of steel in the world, the acquisition is also being seen as a positive step towards achieving the 40-million-tonne target by 2010.

 Deputy managing-director (steel) T. Mukherjee called the acquisition a matter of pride for the country. The Tata Workers Union (TWU) office buzzed with activity. Union president Raghunath Pandey said the company has brought pride to Jharkhand and the country.

 Whatever amount has been paid to acquire a steel giant is in the larger interests of Tata Steel, Pandey said. 

 He said the acquisition would make a difference in setting up greenfield projects in Jharkhand and Bengal.

 Villagers who are against (Tata) setting up manufacturing plants on their land will think again. They will think about the companys history and its contribution towards development of society in tribal-dominated areas of Jharkhand, Pandey added. 

 Tata employees hope the integration would be smooth, as has been the case with previous foreign acquisitions.

 However, some doubts were also creeping into the minds of some employees. Whats in it for me? asked one after news of the takeover reached the steel city.

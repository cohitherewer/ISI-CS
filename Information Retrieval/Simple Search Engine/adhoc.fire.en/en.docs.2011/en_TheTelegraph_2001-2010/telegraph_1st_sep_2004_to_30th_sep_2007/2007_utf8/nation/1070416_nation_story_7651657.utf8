 Calcutta, April 15: A 22-year-old was killed and another seriously injured when a bomb exploded in a night shelter for vigilantes in Dum Dum Park this morning.

 Residents said they heard an explosion around 10.30 in the night guards room. We rushed to the room to see the two youths lying in a pool of blood, said one.

 A team from Lake Town police station soon reached the spot in Lalkuthi and the youths Pintu, who died, and Raju Rajbanshi were taken to hospital. We have found a few more bombs, said North 24-Parganas police chief Praveen Kumar.

 Preliminary investigations revealed that the youths were making bombs at the time of the explosion.

 The police say the youths may have been involved in a turf war between rival groups. 

 The area is controlled by Gedu, who is in prison. His aides have taken over and are trying to keep out the gangs of Pandit and hatkata Dilip. The blast can be a fallout of their fight, said an official. 

 The police added that the gangs run extortion rackets and control real estate transactions in parts of Lake Town, Keshtopur, Baguiati, Dum Dum and Bangur.

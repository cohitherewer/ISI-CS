 New Delhi, Jan. 16: Pouches of country liquor and sweaty wads of clandestinely disbursed money no longer make for effective campaign strategy. Political circles here are agog with tales of ingenious methods being employed to woo voters in the forthcoming Assembly polls in Goa and the municipal polls in Maharashtra.

 Veterans across the political spectrum are mystified by the unique campaign currently under way in Maharashtra and Goa. In Goa, Mumbai and Pune especially, young aspirants are going to extraordinary lengths to attract voters.

 Former Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar today led a delegation to the chief election commissioner, complaining about the level of perversion of poll panel rules and the code of conduct.

 In his complaint to the Election Commission, Parrikar cited instances of the perversion. According to him, advertisements are being given in local newspapers about recruitments in fake companies. One such company, Innovative Computers, has advertised for the posts of regional finance managers, area sales managers, accountants, clerks and peons.

 BJP spokesperson Prakash Javdekar explained that the only aim behind conducting such an elaborate exercise is to bribe voters.

 They make appointments and distribute motorcycles and money. The real purpose of these appointments or the nature of their work is never spelt out. We have found out all these appointments are being done to campaign for a certain political party. The recruits are being given motorcycles and money to campaign for that party. It is a way of bribing people, Javdekar told The Telegraph.

 One of the fake companies that the BJP claimed has been floated to bribe voters is Innovative Computers in Mapusa, Goa. The Telegraph contacted a number listed in the Innovative Computers ad. The person who answered the call refused to identify himself or reveal who owns the company. We will contact you later.

 Javdekar alleged that Innovative Computers is a front of the Congress. Who can think of such innovative ways of corruption? he said.

 Although the BJP took the lead in complaining to the Election Commission, the trend of adopting innovative methods of wooing voters cuts across party lines.

 In the more affluent wards of Goa and cities like Mumbai and Pune where local body elections are to be held shortly, the thumb rule is not to try and bribe individual voters. Collective effort is the new buzzword. For instance, candidates across the party lines have taken to approaching the housing societies and their representatives for putting in a good word for them.

 We offer to do things for the general upkeep of the residential area. Some people get the boundary wall of a residential complex painted. Others pay the common electricity and water bills of a residential complex. One candidate got the lawns mowed and manicured. All this helps you build a good reputation. After all, we are dealing with educated people, said a BJP leader.

 Accordingly, enthusiastic aspirants have thought of an even more unique campaign strategy. In Goa, Pune and Mumbai, aspirants have stuck posters addressed to senior citizens in various residential complexes.

 I am your son, says an aspirant, addressing the elderly population in his constituency. As such, I am duty-bound to help you visit all the holy places. He had his telephone number printed on the posters. After a while, a number of requests came and he organised their travel and accommodation in Pandharpur and Shirdi. Needless to say, his image as a dutiful son was firmly established.

 According to Parrikar, major expenditure is being incurred by probable candidates on such methods. They arrange for free trips to places of pilgrimage. They construct temples. The amount spent in each constituency runs into crores.

 Smug Cong puts iron hand around Rahul 

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, April 16: The Congress is neither apologetic about nor embarrassed by Rahul Gandhis statement on the division of Pakistan.

 According to the party, what the young MP said was historically correct and perfectly relevant to an Uttar Pradesh election campaign where diplomatic niceties are of little consequence to the audience.

 Party insiders said Rahuls controversial statements, including the one on the Babri demolition, were not off-the-cuff utterances but part of a well thought-out strategy to maximise the gains his roadshows had yielded so far.

 There is nothing for us to be apologetic, embarrassed or defensive, said a source. 

 Janaradhan Dwivedi, who normally writes Sonia Gandhis Hindi speeches but has had nothing to do with Rahuls so far, said: Put simply, he was presenting the facts of history and, therefore, his statement should not be distorted. He did not say that India wilfully divided Pakistan. He referred to the creation of Bangladesh as being the result of a sequence of events that entangled India in a big way.

 Dwivedi sought to draw a parallel between the iron hand displayed by Indira Gandhi then and the pucca irada (firm resolve) of Rahul in the context of Uttar Pradesh.

 A duly elected provincial government (in erstwhile East Pakistan) was thrown out, there was a huge influx of refugees into India, the Agra airport was bombed, the US-backed Pakistan and the Seventh Fleet were about to enter our waters. Bangladesh was conceived and born in these circumstances.

 An iron hand was the need to tackle these circumstances and that was given by Indira Gandhi. The central point of Rahuls statement was determination and pucca irada (firm resolve) and that is most relevant to Uttar Pradesh, Dwivedi said.

 Asked how it was linked to Uttar Pradesh, he said: For nearly 20 years, the party has been in a limbo. Rahul implied that he will display the same determination and resolve in lifting the Congress out of the morass that his family had shown in other conditions.

 On whether Rahul could have used his words more judiciously and said liberating Bangladesh instead of Pakistan ko toda (broke up Pakistan), a source said: Remember, hes travelling through the harsh and unrelenting heartland terrain. Nice, subtle words and phrases make no sense to an audience which has grown up on a diet of either communal poison or casteist abuses.

 Insiders said that as Uttar Pradesh would be Rahuls workstation until 2009, the strategy was to tailor his persona and political mannerisms to suit its milieu and requirements.

 His speeches were directed largely at a generation raised a little before or after the heyday of the Congress was over in Uttar Pradesh the mandir-Mandal generation, so to speak.

 Instead of being a shrinking violet and sounding defensive on the Oppositions charges of playing dynastic politics, it was decided that Rahul should go on the offensive. Therefore, few in the Congress shared Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs implied defence of P.V. Narasimha Rao after Rahuls veiled attack on the former Prime Minister over the Babri demolition. 

 In Uttar Pradesh, Rao was seen as being as culpable for the demolition as the Sangh parivar. A revival strategy should naturally distance the Congress from the Rao era, a source said.

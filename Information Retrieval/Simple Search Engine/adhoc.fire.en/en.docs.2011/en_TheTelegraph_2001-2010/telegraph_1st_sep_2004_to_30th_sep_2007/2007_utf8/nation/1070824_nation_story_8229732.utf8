 Bloc heat

 Calcutta, Aug. 23: CPM ally Forward Bloc today stepped up its belligerence against Reliances entry into the Bengal farm retail market and welcomed the Mayavati governments move.

 The partys labour wing, TUCC, defended the attack on Reliance Fresh outlets in Uttar Pradesh and promised a traders strike in Bengal soon.

 The TUCC will hold a meeting of workers from the unorganised sector and small traders on Saturday. Last week, Bloc activists had attacked an under-construction Reliance Retail outlet while the Opposition Trinamul Congress ransacked another.

 Mumbai, June 18: Next time Amitabh Bachchan visits the Siddhivinayak temple, he will have to pamper the deity with things other than his favourite offering of coconuts. 

 He will also have to carry smaller garlands and settle for modaks (sweets), Lord Ganeshas favourite prasad.

 Temple authorities have forbidden coconuts and huge garlands as part of a tighter security drill prompted by intelligence alerts about a terror strike. There are fears explosives could be hidden in these offerings.

 Mumbai police have been warned that a man, identified as Salim Khan, is believed to have entered India to target oil installations, airports and shrines. Security has also been beefed up at the Sai Baba temple in Shirdi. 

 At Siddhivinayak, authorities say they have little choice. Garlands have not been banned. We have only asked devotees not to carry huge trays with big garlands and coconuts. Smaller garlands, flowers, incense sticks, modaks and other sweets are allowed, said Hanumant Jagtap, chief executive officer of the Siddhivinayak trust. 

 Large garlands and coconuts the temple gets about 5,000 daily are difficult to scan when there is a large crowd, like on Tuesdays, Jagtap said, adding the curbs would ensure safety of devotees.

 People have been positive about it. After all, even a tiny flower offered to God with true devotion is sufficient.

 Bachchan might not be the only one upset about the coconuts. Anger is greater among the shopkeepers outside who make a living selling them. They have threatened to take to the streets if the curbs bite into their income.

 We have always cooperated with the temple management on security, but if this is going to affect our earnings, we will have to take to the streets in protest, said Bharat Gupta, general secretary of the Shree Siddhivinayak Puja Sahitya Vikreta Sangh. 

 The scan doesnt end at coconuts, though. Patrolling has been stepped up and a single entry point has been made for devotees. Closed-circuit televisions are in place and a watchtower has been set up. A wall was recently erected to prevent explosives-laden vehicles from ramming into the shrine.

 The measures may appear inconvenient but will have to be imposed for a few days, deputy commissioner Dattatray Phadatare said. 

 Mumbai polices anti-terror squad is probing an email received last week that threatened to target the World Trade Centre at Cuffe Parade. Last month, police had dismissed a letter warning of similar attack as a prank.

 Deadline to repair Boeing defects

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: Aviation regulator DGCA has directed Indian carriers flying new-generation Boeing-737s to repair defects on wing slats within the next ten days.

 The directive follows an emergency order by the US Federal Aviation Authority, which found that loose parts in the wings carrying fuel could lead to leaks and cause fire.

 Investigations by the US body showed that parts came loose during assembly when slat tracks were deployed. As the tracks movable support structures that connect the wing with the slat, a panel that extends from the front of the wing to produce more lift were retracted, loose nuts and bolts pierced the fuel tank in the wing causing leaks.

 Last month, a China Airlines Boeing 737-800 exploded in a fireball seconds after everyone on board had been evacuated. Investigators found that a bolt on the right wing slat had come loose and pierced a fuel tank.

 We have issued instructions to carry out inspection and corrective action through replacement or repairs and keep the DGCA informed about it, the bodys chief Kanu Gohain said.

 The directive is applicable to those carriers that operate Boeing 737 models.

 In India, Air India Express, the cargo wing of the national carrier, has 14 Boeing 737-800s. Air India regional director D.S. Kohli said all 14 were being checked for defects.

 Jet Airways has 29 737-800s and two 737-900s. However, all the 29 737-800s are not new-generation aircraft. An official said inspections were being carried out on the fleet.

 A SpiceJet official said while they have booked 15 737-800s, they had only one of these planes in their fleet now and it was undergoing checks.

 Indian carriers have booked over 130 Boeing 737s, which are yet to be delivered.

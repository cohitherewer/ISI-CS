 New CBI counsel for Ottavio extradition

 Buenos Aires, March 4: (PTI): The Argentinian government has named a new lawyer to plead the CBIs case for extradition of Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi, who is going to rely on judgments given in India in the Bofors case and the failed extradition attempt in Malaysia to scuttle efforts to send him to India.

 Lilian Delgado was appointed counsel to plead Indias case in place of Carlos Daneri because of jurisdictional issues. The new woman lawyer hails from the Misiones province where the extradition proceedings may take place, Indian ambassador to Argentina Pramathesh Rath said.

 News reports earlier had said that Daneri, who speaks only Spanish, is not comfortable with English and was not fully conversant with details of the Quattrocchi case.

 Quattrocchis Argentinian lawyer Alejandro Freeland, who claimed that both he and his client are confounded at the turn of events that resulted in the Bofors accuseds detention in Argentina, said he has neither been contacted by the CBI nor has access to papers that have been supplied to the ministry of foreign affairs.

 Freeland has been researching past precedents in cases involving the Bofors arms deal and believes that there is significant evidence that the case being brought against Quattrocchi is based on fictitious events, this view being supported by a judge in Delhi High Court in rulings in 2004 and 2005 during the Hinduja brothers Bofors trial.

 It is likely that these cases, and the failed Malaysian extradition attempt will form the basis of Quattrocchis defence should the case proceed to a hearing, he said.

 According to Freeland, Quattrocchi was a resident in India until 1993, seven years after the Bofors disposal, and was never questioned or approached by the CBI during this time. Following the last extradition attempt in Malaysia in 1997, Quattrocchi returned to Italy and again, no attempt was made by the CBI to begin extradition proceedings there.

 Quattrocchi, 69, was detained in Argentina on February 6 on the basis of an Interpol alert. He was released on bail on February 23 but he has been prohibited from leaving the country.

 After bike stunts, holy service 

 A bunch of daredevils has landed straight in the house of God. 

 Fifteen drunk and underage motorcycle riders who spread terror at Connaught Place with their stunts have to perform kar seva at gurdwaras. 

 For the next month, the boys who hit a couple of policemen as they drove with their front wheels up in the air through a packed late-night crowd have to wash dishes and clean shoes and slippers.

 The 15 were granted bail after furnishing a bond of Rs 25,000 each. But trial court judge Swarna Kanta Mehra ruled that they would have to perform seven hours of community service at a gurdwara each week. Most of the boys are Sikh. 

 The boys will have to produce before the court a certificate from the gurdwara at the end of the month, saying they had completed their stipulated hours of community service.

 Netizens, cops are watching

 Beware Internet users, you are being watched. Mumbai polices cyber crime investigation cell is collecting data of netizens from Internet service providers (ISP) in the city to track down Net pranksters.

 Earlier, the police had to contact ISPs to get the Internet protocol (IP) address of a computer. But now, with the names of all Internet users at their fingertips, the task of tracing pranksters will become much easier and faster. 

 We have at least four such CDs containing IP addresses of Internet users in the city. We are now in the process of loading some more CDs from the remaining ISPs, said deputy commissioner of police (preventive) Sanjay Mohite, who also heads the cyber cell.

 Mohite said only a printout of an offending mail could land a prankster behind bars. If someone who has received any unwanted email of obscene or derogatory content approaches us with a printout, we can trace the sender directly without approaching the ISPs, he said. 

 Ganesha in green drive 

 The green campaign for keeping the Husseinsagar Lake clean has had a divine start.

 The Khairatabad Ganesha Utsav Committee has decided to give up artificial colours and use only natural dye to paint its 40-foot idol the biggest in Hyderabad.

 The natural colours the idol will don will be made of pomegranate bark, neem, turmeric and vegetable oil.

 The Khairatabad committee plans to set up a Ganesh complex, where an 18-headed idol (Vishwarupa Ganesh) will sit on a globe in the company of 18 smaller idols.

 Two quintals of natural dye, one tonne of steel and over three tonnes of clay will go into making them. 

 We used to spend over Rs 1 lakh just for the paint earlier. Now it will become 50 per cent cheaper, said Sudarshan, the secretary of the committee.. 

 Code puzzle

 Tamil Nadus Q-branch cops are wracking their brains to decipher the cryptic language used by smugglers, militants and ferry operators when they travel to and from Sri Lanka.

 Officials have being able to unravel some of the code words, including bus stand (which actually means port), haunted by ghost (landing point), lathiman (customs officials), horseman (Coast Guard) and token (refugees).

 As the Arichalmunai coast is monitored by naval and Coast Guard personnel, the ferry operators who double as smugglers land at different points and inform their agents through cellphones using code words, which they keep changing, the officials said.

 Mumbai: Celebrate Vada Pav Day on August 23 at a Jumbo King store near you. You can win gold coins, too, as you feast on Mumbais favourite snack. You just need to spend Rs 10 and complete the caption: We believe vada pav will rule New York because.... So, get, set and gorge.

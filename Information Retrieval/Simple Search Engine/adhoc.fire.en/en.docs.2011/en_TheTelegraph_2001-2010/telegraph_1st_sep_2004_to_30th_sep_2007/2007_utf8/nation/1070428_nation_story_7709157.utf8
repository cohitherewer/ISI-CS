 Quota plea in same court

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, April 27: The petitions challenging reservation for OBCs in central educational institutions will be heard by the same bench which had stalled the Centres attempts to enforce the move from this year itself. 

 Justice Arijit Pasayat and Justice L.S. Panta will hear the case on May 8. 

 The judges, while refusing to lift their March 29 stay on the 27 per cent reservation early this week, said they would hear the Centres plea in the third week of August. But the Centre approached Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, who advanced the hearing to May 8.

 Having brought the date forward, Balakrishnan, following procedure, assigned the matter to Pasayat and Panta since they have been dealing with the issue.

 The Centre had hoped a larger bench would settle the constitutional validity of the Central Educational Institutions (Reservations in Admission) Act, 2006. 

 With the same bench seized of the matter, the Centre could now ask for the plea to be referred back to the chief justice, who will decide whether to constitute a larger bench.

 The fate of the OBC candidates who have cleared the IIM entrance test depends on how soon such a bench is formed. 

 Forest panel

 The apex court has allowed the forest advisory committee to clear projects stalled since December 2006. The order modifies its earlier directive restraining the panel from approving private and public sector plans in designated forest areas. The curbs on the committees powers followed objections to the appointment of certain members.

 Addiction dust on video games

 G.S. MUDUR AND AFP

 Getting hooked?

 New Delhi, June 26: In a brightly-lit basement shop in a northwestern suburb of Pune, school children jostle for time on computers to enter car races, evade stalking villains or delve into other fantasy worlds that video games offer.

 They troop in through the day, waiting for turns on the computers, paying Rs 10 for each hour of play. This is actually an Internet cafe but games draw as many customers as does the Net, says the boy on the counter.

 Not just the boy but doctors are also beginning to take note.

 Many doctors are now engaged in an intense debate over the addictive potential of entertainment through video games.

 A report from the American Medical Association (AMA) recommending that Internet and video game addiction be considered a mental disorder was watered down after a heated debate broke out among delegates at its annual convention in Chicago this week, AFP reported today.

 Some delegates questioned whether there is enough evidence to support claims that excessive game playing is similar to pathological gambling. Others insisted on more studies before advising parents to impose one- or two-hour limits on video games.

 We see children who need counselling to spend less time on video games, but there is no evidence yet to conclusively say that overuse of video games is an addiction, said Rajesh Parikh, a neuropsychiatrist at the Jaslok Hospital in Mumbai.

 The most common reason children are brought to us is poor academic performance or poor socialisation, Parikh said. The addictive potential of nicotine and caffeine and alcohol were also debated for long so we cant rule out evidence coming up in the future, he said.

 But some doctors say there is already reason for worry. Money is stolen for time in video game parlours, and students fail in exams, said Harish Shetty, a psychiatrist at Mumbais Hiranandani Hospital.

 The industry has predicted a steeper curve in the growth of Indias video game market. A market intelligence agency last week said Indias video game console market is expected to grow to $125 million by 2010 from $ 13.3 million in 2006.

 The report for the AMA which analysed studies over the past 22 years said there are some indications of a connection between the content of video games and aggressive and addictive behaviour, but added that more research is needed in this area.

 One study showed that dependence-like behaviour is more likely to occur in children who start playing video games at younger ages. Symptoms of increasing use and disruption of social relationships appear in patterns similar to that of other addictive disorders, it said.

 Some studies have indicated that exposure to video game violence may promote aggressive behaviour. But others have failed to detect any causal relationship between video game violence and aggression.

 Others have pointed out that video games may also provoke epileptic seizures one study in the UK put the risk at 1.5 per 100,000 children. In 2001, doctors in a medical college in Chandigarh reported two cases of epilepsy induced by video games.

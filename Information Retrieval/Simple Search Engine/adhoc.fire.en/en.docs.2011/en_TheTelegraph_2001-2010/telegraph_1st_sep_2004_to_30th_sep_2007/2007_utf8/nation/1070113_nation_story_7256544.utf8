 Mulayam session

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Jan. 12: Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav today announced a fresh Assembly session from January 18 after a patch-up meeting with governor T.V. Rajeswar.

 The ruling Samajwadi Party, with which the Rashtriya Lok Dal recently snapped ties, is looking to seek a vote of confidence during the new session.

 The governor will address a joint session of the upper and lower Houses, as per norms, on January 18. 

 In an apparent bid to mend fences, the chief minister called on Rajeswar at noon and was closeted with him for about 45 minutes.

 Mulayam urged the governor to reduce the conventional time gap that is mandatory before calling a fresh session from 14 days to six, Samajwadi Party sources said. Rajeswar agreed. 

 Stepping out of Raj Bhavan, the chief minister said: The talks were on a cordial note. He has agreed to let us hold the session on January 18.

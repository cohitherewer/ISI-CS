 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Up early for a fit body and mind

 Chennai: Besant Nagar beach, the Marina sands, Ashok Nagar First Avenue, Pulla Reddy Avenue and Anna Nagar Tower Park anywhere you go, the upscale Chennai neighbourhoods are crawling with early risers at 4 am.

 Youngsters jogging their way to fitness or the 40-plus huffing and puffing to beat the bulge they are dressed for the part, too, in their tracksuits and canvas shoes. 

 Some have even formed associations like one in Jeeva Park which collect a small annual fee from members to keep the parks clean. Others organise free yoga classes.

 But while keeping the body fit is top priority, the mind is not forgotten either.

 Every morning, a Thought for the Day is chalked on a blackboard at the parks to give the fitness freaks something to chew on as they exercise. Usually its a couplet from the classical Tamil treatise Thirukkural.

 To Orkut, with exam protest

 Mumbai: This is a first! An online signature campaign is being run on Orkut by students protesting the rescheduling of the BSc-IT exams. 

 About 3,600 students have turned to the community website to protest Mumbai Universitys decision to advance the exams by two months from May to March. The students in a lurch because most colleges have not completed the syllabus and the project work.

 The students got together through Orkut and have forwarded a protest letter to examination controller, Prakash Wani of Mumbai University.

 We will consider their demands and will hold a meeting with officials to see if they are justified, Wani said. 

 When the change in date was announced, some students sent an SOS through Orkut, to which 100 students from 60 different colleges offering the course responded, and the protest spread like wildfire.

 Business in time of love

 Bangalore: On Valentines Day, when a long-stemmed red rose is presented to a sweetheart in Europe, chances are it will smell of the Bangalore earth. The business of growing roses for exports put the city on the global map long before the IT revolution did. 

 This V-Day is no different, with floriculturists hoping to send across over 50 million stems, up from 30 million last year. To get an idea of the big bucks involved, the V-Day flower business accounts for half the worlds $80 billion flower industry. 

 The flowers are loaded onto cargo aircraft hired for the purpose and head out to Europe, Australia, the UK, West Asia and Russia all growing markets. 

 Ramakrishna Karaturi, who manages Karaturi networks, officially Indias largest flower exporter, says the tech city grows a variety of roses. But red is the colour of choice in the season of love. 

 Sequel, 25 yrs on

 Delhi: Twenty-five years ago, a South Asia goodwill summit paved the way for Saarc. Now, another one is on its way. 

 Organised by international Rotarians, the summit opens in the capital on Monday. 

 The two-day conference, billed as track-two diplomacy, is intended to help evolve a shared agenda among South Asian countries for development. 

 Former Sri Lanka President Chandrika Kumaratunga and former Indian Prime Minister I.K. Gujral will be among the speakers. 

 The conference will cover population and health concerns, corporate social responsibility and a plenary session with speakers from Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

New Delhi: Visiting Bahai Temple? Take a detour to the Jamia Millia university where Arab manuscripts dating 922 AD to 1591 AD are on display at a month-long show. The 2,000 manuscripts cover Quranic studies, unani medicine, astrology, music, astronomy, history and geography.

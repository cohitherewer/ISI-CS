 Hadley: The hero

 New Delhi, July 21: India is the worlds sixth nuclear weapons power in all but name.

 Over lunch in Washington yesterday, two years and two days after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President George W. Bush agreed that India and the US would enter into a special, nuclear relationship, the deal was finally done.

 With his coalitions nominee Pratibha Patil the new President and Hamid Ansari likely to follow soon as Vice-President, the nuclear deal is a big feather in Manmohan Singhs cap.

 Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon is flying back tonight and the cabinet committee on security will meet over the next week to clear the deal. With that, the US government goes back to its Congress with the text. Its enough to make the deal public.

 In the end, Delhi got exactly what it has wanted from the beginning: the right to reprocess spent fuel from civilian nuclear reactors, as well as a very delicately worded compromise on fuel assurances from the American side.

 Still, when the story of the Indo-US nuclear deal is written, the award for the hero of the hour must go to Bushs key aide and US national security adviser Steve Hadley. 

 It was with Hadley that his Indian counterpart M.K. Narayanan has been confabulating for the last many months and to him that Narayanan made the proposal for a separately safeguarded storage facility to reprocess the spent fuel on the eve of the Heilingendamm talks in Germany in early June.

 Hadley called Narayanan on Thursday morning and said: On your way to meeting the Vice-President (Dick Cheney) at 2pm, could you drop by my office please?

 Narayanan did and it was in this meeting that the two broke the logjam of fuel assurances in perpetuity for Indias civilian nuclear reactors. Narayanan had argued that the US must live up to the promise by Bush in Delhi on March 2 that it would help India with its civilian nuclear programme, assuring fuel in perpetuity in exchange for safeguards in perpetuity.

 In the end, at Narayanans 30-minute meeting with Cheney, only two minutes were spent discussing civil nuclear issues. 

 The day before, the US side had already agreed to give India reprocessing rights. Delhi would be allowed to reprocess the spent fuel from its reactors in the safeguarded storage facility.

 Now with Hadley and Narayanan working out a delicate compromise on Americas right to return, which dictates all nuclear assistance to any country by law, and what would happen in a hypothetical situation if India tested, the deal was as good as done. 

 By Friday lunchtime, when all sides met and toasted each other, it transpired that the brass-tacks negotiators Indias S. Jaishanker and Americas Richard Stratford had spent about 300 hours in negotiations. 

 A joint news release said: The discussions were constructive and positive, and both undersecretary Burns and foreign secretary Menon are pleased with the substantial progress made on outstanding issues in the 123 Agreement.

 US diplomats argued that fuel supply guarantees were as important as giving India the right to reprocess. According to American law, if any offending country conducts a nuclear test, the US can invoke the right of return clause, that is, ask for all the nuclear fuel as well as all the equipment sent. 

 But top diplomats from Washington said the reality was that even if India did conduct a test, the US would not be able to invoke the law. 

 You can never put the toothpaste back into the tube. If the US gives India large amounts of nuclear fuel as well as a bunch of nuclear reactors, the truth is that a few billion dollars of US investment in India will effectively tie down Americas hands, a diplomat said.

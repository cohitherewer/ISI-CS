 Sighs of relief all around 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Sanjay Dutt

 Mumbai, Aug. 20: A fellow actor called it the most stupendous piece of news he had heard. Another said she couldnt tell how happy she was. And a veteran filmmaker said it was simply wonderful.

 As hundreds of fans gathered outside Punes Yerwada jail where Sanjay Dutt has been serving his six-year term, back home in Mumbai the film fraternity expressed solidarity with the star.

 One called it an emotionally positive moment for the industry. He is like a family member and we will stand by him, said filmmaker Ashok Pandit.

 Before going to jail, Sanjay had been shooting for Kidnap, directed by Sanjay Gadhvi. The fate of other films like Alibaug and Mr Fraud also hang in the balance. At least Rs 80 crore rides on the actor who, prison sources said, has been spending his time weaving bamboo chairs.

 Others, though, were cautious, knowing that the reprieve from the Supreme Court might be only for a few days.

 This is just an interim bail. The final judgment will be decisive. The completion of his projects depends on the number of days that he is out on bail, said trade analyst Taran Adarsh.

 The anti-terror court, which had sentenced the Munnabhai star in the Bombay blasts case, is expected to give a copy of its judgment by August 27, hardly enough to complete shoots.

 Sanjays lawyers had moved the apex court against his conviction and sought bail until their petition was ruled on. But they said they could not argue the case as they were yet to get a copy of the judgment of the anti-terror court.

 The apex court agreed and said the nature of the offence and the evidence is very difficult to examine at this stage, and granted bail to the actor until the lawyers get a copy of the Mumbai courts verdict.

 Despite the niggling fear, most in the industry were celebrating. Sources close to the family said buddy Sanjay Gupta has already left for Pune to drive the star down to Mumbai when he gets out of jail tomorrow.

 Good friend Bunty Walia, who had followed the star to the jail in his car, said he was very happy. 

 This is the result of all the prayers of his fans and the efforts of his family. I was hoping that Sanjay would get relief. Its a great moment for the family, Walia said.

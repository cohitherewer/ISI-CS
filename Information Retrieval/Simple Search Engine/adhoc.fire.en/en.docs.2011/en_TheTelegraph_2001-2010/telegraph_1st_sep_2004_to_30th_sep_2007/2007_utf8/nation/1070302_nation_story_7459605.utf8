 Cabinet nod for violence bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 1: The Centre tonight cleared a bill looking to severely punish those who carry out or aid communal violence, and to provide speedy justice and generous relief to victims.

 The cabinet also approved a bill to regulate foreign providers in education so that they implement all Indian laws, such as those on quotas.

 The Communal Violence (Prevention, Control and Rehabilitation of Victims) Bill, 2005, pending for two years, gives authorities from the district-level to the Centre wide powers to try and keep peace between communities. It prescribes a six-year suspension for officials who do not do enough to prevent sectarian clashes.

 The states can declare any region communally disturbed and take special measures. Collectors have to scrutinise the conduct of political leaders in their districts. Anyone who threatens a witness can be jailed for three years.

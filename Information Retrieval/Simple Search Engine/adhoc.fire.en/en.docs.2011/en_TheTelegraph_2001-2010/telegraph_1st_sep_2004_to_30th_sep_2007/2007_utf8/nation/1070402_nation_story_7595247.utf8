 NRI wife killer in airport net

 New Delhi, April 1 (PTI): A non-resident Indian, who allegedly killed his wife in Houston and then fled to India, has been arrested here.

 Avatar Gretal, 32, was arrested on his arrival at the airport late last night by a Continental Airlines flight from New Jersey, police sources said. An Interpol lookout notice had been issued against him.

 American police claimed he had killed his wife Nanete Naur, 30, on Thursday in her home where she lived alone.

 Naur was seeking a divorce from Gretal, Phoenix police said. The two had split and he was living in Vancouver, Canada.

 Gretal, originally from Punjab, was seen outside his wifes house on Thursday, the police said, adding that they believed he flew from Canada to Phoenix.

 When Naur didnt show up for work on Friday, her colleagues went to her house and found blood and signs of a struggle, the police said yesterday. Investigators then found her body.

 The police said they have an initial idea about how she was killed and are waiting for the medical examiners report, detective Bob Rags Dale, a Phoenix police spokesman, was quoted as saying by the daily Arizona Republic.

 After the crime, Gretal flew to New Jersey on a one-way ticket and then purchased another one-way ticket to India, the police said.

 The Patiala house court has sent Gretal to a days judicial custody.

 Naurs family lives in Gurgaon.

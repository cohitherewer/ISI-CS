 Encounter probe rap

 New Delhi, July 30 (PTI): The probe into the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter came under attack in the Supreme Court today with the court-appointed counsel and a relative of the victim accusing the Gujarat government of filing a charge sheet that would benefit the accused.

 Additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium questioned the conduct of the state and its investigating agency in handling the case. Sohrabuddins brother Rubabuddin added a communal angle, alleging Muslims in Gujarat were not getting a fair deal even in courts.

 The history of the state in recent years (post-Godhra) will show that any accused who is a Hindu is released, but Muslims are not released, said senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for Rubabuddin.

 , before a bench headed by Justice Tarun Chatterjee.

 He claimed that there had been a pattern in all encounter killings and people from the minority community were being targeted and branded terrorists or associated with Pakistans ISI.

 Subramanium and Dave said the charge sheet was unacceptable. 

 The charge sheet is such that it is impossible that there would be conviction in the case, Dave said.

 The two senior advocates took umbrage against the state after its counsel, K.T.S. Tulsi, said that first they wanted the investigation to be conducted by inspector-general (CID) Geeta Johri and now she was the target of accusation.

 They refuted the allegation, saying they were against the system and Johri was just a part of it.

 They pointed out that though the charge sheet mentioned Sohrabuddin and his wife Kauser Bi killed two days after her husband there was nothing on the third person who was picked up with them from a bus on the way from Hyderabad to Ahmedabad.

 In its FIR, Gujarat police had said the third person was Tulsiram Prajapati but the charge sheet said the other person was possibly one Kalimuddin.

 There are several gaps and loopholes in the charge sheet, said Subramaniam, referring to the period between November 26 and November 28, 2005, when Sohrabuddin and Kauser were killed. 

 Questions were also raised on the role of the Gujarat police for not opposing the anticipatory bail plea of N.K. Amin, a senior officer with the state CID who was allegedly present when Kauser was cremated.

 Subramaniam said the charge sheet also failed to mention as accused the seven police officials from Andhra Pradesh who were part of the joint team that picked up the victims from the bus.

 Antony spills arms secret

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 18: Defence minister A.K. Antony has disclosed that significant consignments of arms, which have been imported in recent months, were defective.

 The minister did not give details but even this admission is a rare show of transparency by the military establishment that discloses only under questioning from government watchdogs like the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).

 India is one of the largest buyers of military hardware in the world, a bulk of it from Russia and the former Soviet bloc countries but increasingly also from Israel and the West.

 Large portions of equipment imported from abroad have been found to be defective, the defence minister said today at the inaugural of a two-day meeting of the chiefs of ordnance factories.

 Last year, the CAG pointed out in a report that Krasnopol ammunition imported from Russia for the Indian Armys heavy artillery guns (Bofors 155mm Howitzers) were defective. India has imported military hardware and software worth $10.5 billion in the last three years.

 A delegation led by defence secretary Shekhar Dutt is in Russia and understood to be trying to sort out glitches in imports. But Antony said the delivery of the Gorshkov aircraft carrier to be re-christened INS Vikramaditya will be delivered to the Indian Navy by the end of 2008 as scheduled. The Gorshkov is one of the largest military purchases by India.

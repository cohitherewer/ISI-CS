 Debate challenge to PM

 OUR BUREAU AND PTI

 Feb. 16: L.K. Advani today challenged Manmohan Singh to a face-to-face debate on price rise but the BJP leader may have to wait till the budget session rolls.

 Campaigning in Uttarakhand, Advani referred to inflation and said: Let there be a discussion with Manmohan Singh face to face.

 Advani did not say whether he meant a US-style televised debate or a discussion in the Lok Sabha. 

 While nobody in the PMO or the Congress would yet say if Singh would pick up Advanis gauntlet, party sources said the Prime Ministers record showed he was never coy about taking on the BJP leader.

 Each time Advani described Singh as a weak Prime Minister, he had gently reminded Sardar Patel II of his score card record as the NDA governments home minister with facts and figures of terror attacks and the rate of arrests and convictions.

 On the first day of the budget session in Parliament, the government will offer to the Opposition a debate on price rise under any rule it wants. 

 Within the UPA as well as the Congress, pressure is building up on inflation and the government feels that a discussion would give MPs a chance to articulate their points of view.

 The Prime Minister is expected to reply to such a discussion, instead of leaving it to the finance minister.

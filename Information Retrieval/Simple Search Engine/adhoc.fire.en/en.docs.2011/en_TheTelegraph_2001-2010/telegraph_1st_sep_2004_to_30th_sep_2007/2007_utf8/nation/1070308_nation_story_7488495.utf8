 Mumbai, March 7: Liz Hurley and Arun Nayar hadnt reckoned with so many unwanted guests at Tuesdays talk-of-the-town party thrown by Parmeshwar Godrej.

 First, it was BMC, which, acting on a complaint filed by Juhu Citizens Welfare Committee, ensured the demolition of a platform running from the Godrej bungalow to the beach. The 30-foot shaft had been erected in violation of civic laws that forbid structures on the beach without permission.

 Since Sunday, people were being denied access to the beach and the lane near Military Road that led to the beach was closed to the public. Security guards were turning people away. Thats when we decided to take up the matter, said Vishwanath Mada of the Juhu Citizens Welfare Committee.

 Liz arrived early at the sea-front residence last evening, around 7 pm. She hurried inside to avoid the waiting hordes of media crew, said Malini Punjabi, who stays in an adjacent building. 

 Not long before the Bedazzled star stepped in, the platform was torn down, she said.

 Then came another interruption. This time, the party-poopers had arrived in force coast guard, navy, police and customs.

 We spotted them throwing fireworks into the sea around 1 am. We had to go to the bungalow to ask them to stop it. Flares are used as signals by vessels at night. Lighting fireworks can lead to confusion, a coast guard official said.

 The police walked in around 2.30 am. By then, the neighbours had almost resigned to a sleepless night, said Mada.

 Noise control regulations forbid loudspeakers after 10 pm. We asked them to switch off the music. The sound manager has been fined Rs 3,000, said Pradeep Shinde, a senior police inspector.

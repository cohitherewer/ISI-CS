 Gleeful 

BJP to wait amp; watch

 SANJAY K. JHA

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: The Lefts decisive stance against the nuclear deal, linking its fate with the survival of the Manmohan Singh government, has delighted the BJP. 

 Although the party itself is not fully prepared to face elections at this juncture, the separation of the Left from the UPA is no mean achievement for the saffron camp.

 The BJP did not formally respond to the snowballing crisis today, but its leaders said in private conversations that any dilution in the commitment of the Left to the Congress in the name of secularism would help the Opposition.

 It has called a meeting of the NDA tomorrow to discuss the nuclear issue, after which a joint news conference will be held. Party leaders also want to assess the Congress response to the Lefts ultimatum before saying anything. 

 The BJP feels the Prime Ministers public display of indiscretion, as manifested in his recent utterances, will create an image crisis for him.

 The party believes the opposition to the nuclear deal has shaken Manmohan. Even small leaders dont use this language, said BJP deputy leader in the Lok Sabha V.K. Malhotra, indicating that the party would corner Manmohan for his havan remark.

 The Prime Minister was quoted by a news magazine yesterday as saying that some BJP leaders had organised havans for his death.

 Malhotra said Manmohan had devalued the high office he holds and should apologise to the nation.

 Party vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi described the remark as unfortunate, and said: He is getting nightmares because the Left has endangered his government. Its like Mungerilal ke darawne sapne. 

 The BJP anticipates that the Prime Ministers image will be completely bruised even if his government survives this crisis.

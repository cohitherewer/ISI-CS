 Points for the weak in Delhi nurseries

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 13: A committee appointed by Delhi High Court to streamline nursery admissions in the capital has recommended extra points for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe children.

 The panel, headed by Central Board of Secondary Education chairman Ashok Ganguly, today placed before the court a revised distribution of 100 points on the basis of which it recommended nursery admissions be conducted. The new system tries to meet social goals better, Ganguly said. 

 Five points are to be given to every child who has SC/ST parents under the new system.

 Whether a child lives far away from a school or near one, the system comes as good news for both. Those living within 3km of the school they want admission in are entitled to 30 points as opposed to 20 earlier. Students who live beyond 12km from the school were earlier eligible for zero point. But now, those who stay even 15km away will get 6 points.

 The revised system addresses an issue that private schools had been clamouring about for long greater autonomy in the admission process. Schools now have complete freedom to set their own markers for 25 points, as opposed to 20 earlier.

 The Ganguly committee had come in for criticism for allowing schools to distinguish between applicants on the basis of their parents suitability to the school ethos.

 The 20 points earmarked for this have been cut down to 10. 

 Children of the school alumni, who were earlier eligible for 10 points, will now get only 5.

 Lock-up turns dance bar

 Bar girls protest in Mumbai against the Maharashtra governments decision to close dance bars

 Lucknow, April 28: For about two hours last night, a police station almost turned into a dance bar. The performers: six young women picked up hours earlier from a trade fair.

 Meerut police had arrested the six, allegedly hired by shopkeepers to draw crowds, from the Nauchandi mela grounds after locals complained of indecent shows at night.

 After dumping the women in the Kotwali lock-up, the policemen apparently decided to have some fun. They asked the women to dance while they guzzled booze.

 When the women were dancing, not a single senior officer was present. So everyone, including other undertrials in the lock-up, had good fun, a policeman said.

 Some television crew who were at the fair at the time of the arrests landed up at the police station and filmed the dance. The performance was beamed on every local channel this morning. 

 Uttar Pradesh home secretary S.M. Srivastava said a probe has been ordered.

 The women, who were produced in court today, claimed they had been forced to perform in the lock-up. They have been granted bail.

 Dance shows are not new to the Nauchandi fair, which started off as a cattle fair but has become a commercial-cum-religious affair now. Sources said nude dances were performed late at night.

 The fair administration had banned such dances a few years ago, but clandestine shows are still held.

 12 held for Laden plea

 Raisen, June 17 (PTI): Twelve persons were arrested for allegedly asking people to support international terror mastermind Osama bin Laden, police said today. 

 Acting on a complaint by Shahar Qazi Zahiruddin that around a dozen persons were preaching a different version of Islam at a house in Chopra Mohalla, the 12 were arrested last night, the police said. 

 Raids were conducted in Bhopal but no clues were found linking them with any terrorist outfit, superintendent of police K.C. Jain said. 

 Local residents claim the accused were asking youths to follow the path of bin Laden and wage war against the US.

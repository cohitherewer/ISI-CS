 US holds out work visa hope 

 Washington, July 20 (PTI): A top US lawmaker has introduced an amendment to the higher education reconciliation legislation that would strengthen employers access to skilled workers.

 The amendment would allow the departments of state and homeland security to recapture unused employment-based visas.

 It does not mean an increase in the number of employment-based visas but is a directive for the agencies to utilise the available ones a move that is likely to help Indians seeking work in the US.

 A key part of the American economy is our ability to innovate. Yet, today, our countrys technology companies are facing an impending crisis which requires critical interim relief, Senator John Cornyn said.

 USCISs (US Citizenship and Immigration Services) announcement this year that the cap for H-1B workers was met in just one day, coupled with the recent July announcement that employment-based visas were no longer available for those with advanced degrees, makes it clear that industry needs interim relief today until we can return to comprehensive immigration reform, the Republican senator of Texas said.

 This amendment will go a long way to help out businesses that are the life-blood of the US economy and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting it, Cornyn said.

 He is on the immigration, border security and citizenship sub-committee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

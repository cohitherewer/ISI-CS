 MP towns on the boil

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhopal, Jan. 27: Several Madhya Pradesh towns were on tenterhooks today after mysterious acts of provocation coincided with Jain and Muslim festivals and a Sangh parivar anniversary.

 The police staged a flag march and clamped prohibitory orders in parts of Jabalpur where some Jain posters referring to the Gajrath festival were found torn up. In Indore, unidentified people tried to desecrate a mazaar in the Jinsi locality and snatched a flag but the police moved quickly to prevent a flare-up.

 Although no one seemed to know who had torn the posters, Bajrang Dal activists retaliated in Jabalpurs Kotwali area, forcing the Rapid Action Force to be rushed in.

 Jabalpur, like the rest of the state, is witnessing Muharram and Gajrath processions daily. The Bajrang Dal and other Sangh parivar outfits are celebrating the centenary of ideologue M.S. Golwalkar with over 500 Hindu sammelans (gatherings) across the state.

 Pankaj Chaturvedi, a Youth Congress leader, alleged that the sammelans were doing a lot of damage. Over free lunch, many canards are being spread and people are being given incorrect accounts of the Kashmir dispute and issues like the uniform civil code and Article 370.

 Its the festival season for various communities. We are trying to sort the matter out but it is not yet resolved. So we have imposed Section 144, Jabalpur district magistrate Sanjay Dubey said. The Gajrath Mahotsava venue at Vijaynagar tonight will be exempt.

 Dubey said more than 25 people from different communities have been detained. Schools and colleges have been asked to remain closed till further orders.

 Maulana Mehmood Ali Kadri, mufti of Jabalpur, said some youths were attacked for tearing posters. But we carried out a check ourselves and found that our boys were not involved. There is mischief afoot.

 Kadri said that when Jain community leaders were asked for names, they dodged the question. Bajrang Dal activists, however, said they suspected the Muharram processions. Matters worsened when the Jains, too, pointed a finger at Muslims.

 Jain leaders staged a dharna while Muslim leaders met at Kadris home.

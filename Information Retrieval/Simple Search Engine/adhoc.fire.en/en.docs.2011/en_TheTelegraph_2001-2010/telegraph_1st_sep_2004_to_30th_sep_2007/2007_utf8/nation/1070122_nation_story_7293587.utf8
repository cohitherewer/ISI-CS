 Translation of good texts on PM table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 21: Translation of good academic and literary texts is a top priority for the Prime Minister, who wants to institute a National Translation Mission as soon as possible to widen the reach of such books.

 In a recent report to Manmohan Singh, the National Knowledge Commission said: There is an urgent need to expand the quantity and improve the quality of translation of different types in the different domains of technical, business, literary and scientific knowledge. 

 Books considered important will be translated into as many languages as possible. The process is expected to rope in private initiative, so that high quality translation in different areas becomes feasible.

 Translation activities should be seen in tandem with the plan to increase access of English language training across the population and the promotion of English in school education at the primary level, the knowledge commission said. Both are aspects of the goal to increase access to knowledge.

 The commission wants English to be introduced along with the mother tongue from Class I. Nine states have already introduced English as a compulsory subject from Class I.

 The culture of translation at present is erratic and not systematic. The choice at present is either to encourage people to write second-rate textbooks or to translate best quality textbooks, say experts from Hyderabads Central Institute for Study of Indian and Foreign Languages. 

 The mission will give an impetus to develop the skill as an industry and also help generate employment. Experts point out that with the range of Indian languages and the potential for foreign language translation, the industry could eventually employ between 200,000 and half-a-million people.

 Conceived as a small body in terms of infrastructure, the mission would have a budget adequate to enable it to carry out targeted funding in identified areas. It will not function as a centralised institute, and would require involvement of states and local bodies. 

 Various digital tools of translation, including thesaurus, bilingual dictionaries and translation software, will be used.

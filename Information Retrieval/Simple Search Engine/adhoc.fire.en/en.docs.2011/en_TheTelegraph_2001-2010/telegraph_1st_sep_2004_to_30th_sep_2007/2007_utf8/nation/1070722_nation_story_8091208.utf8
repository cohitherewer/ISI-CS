 Gujarat buys time on riot CD

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, July 21: A compact disc that attempts to prove collusion between the Gujarat government, police and Sangh parivar activists during the 2002 riots took centre stage at the Nanavati-Shah Commission today, with the state given two weeks to explain its stand.

 The CD, given to the riots probe panel by CBI superintendent Rahul Sharma three years ago, contains cellphone records purportedly showing that state ministers were in touch with the accused on February 27 and 28, 2002. 

 Advocate Mukul Sinha of the Jansangharsh Manch, which is representing the riot victims, today handed an analysis of the CD to the commission. But government counsel Arvind Pandya sought time to submit his sides version.

 The commission said that if Pandya failed to come up with an analysis of the cellphone records in two weeks, the panel would assume that the government had nothing to say in the matter.

 The CD, which contains the cellphone records of some 40 police officers, ministers and Sangh activists, shows who had spoken to whom, when and from where.

 It allegedly shows that Naroda MLA Mayaben Kodnani was in Naroda village, instigating a mob, although she has denied being there on February 28, 2002, when 80-odd people were massacred in Naroda-Patia. 

 The then home minister, Gordhan Zadaphia, is accused of having been in constant touch with Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Jaideep Patel as well as Bipin Panchal, a riot accused. 

 The cellphone records also purportedly show that senior ministers, including chief minister Narendra Modi, were at the Shahibaugh circuit house between 4pm and 5.30pm on February 28 while dozens were being burnt to death at Gulbarg Society just 3km away.

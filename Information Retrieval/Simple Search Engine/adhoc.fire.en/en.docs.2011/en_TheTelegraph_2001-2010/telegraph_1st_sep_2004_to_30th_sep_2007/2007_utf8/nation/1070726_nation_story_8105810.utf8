 Death for bomber

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 25: A special anti-terror court today sentenced the last of the 17 Bombay blast bombers to death.

 Mohammed Farooq Pawle was sentenced for planting bombs at the Air India headquarters and at Lucky petrol pump near Shiv Sena Bhavan.

 There cannot be any other sentence adequate but death, judge Pramod Kode said as he handed out multiple sentences to 41-year-old Pawle, a Tiger Memon associate. 

 Pawle faces 24 charges the maximum for any accused among the 100 convicted and has been found guilty on five counts, the highest so far. 

 Unlike the bombers who had burst out in fury after being handed death yesterday, an unwell Pawle slept on a wooden bench while his sentence was pronounced. 

 Todays sentence also set the stage for the verdicts on actor Sanjay Dutt, his three friends and four members of Memons family. All have been summoned on Friday, but it is unclear if the court will give a decision on the probation application by Dutt, who turns 48 on Sunday. The actor and his friends face five to 10 years in jail if their plea is rejected.

 SC nod to pilgrim subsidy

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 7: The Supreme Court today allowed the Centre to provide financial subsidy to Haj and Kailash Mansarovar pilgrims this year.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan extended the stay that a bench of the apex court had earlier ordered on an Allahabad High Court ruling that restrained the government from providing funds or financial subsidy to pilgrims.

 Last year, the apex court had suspended the operation of the interim restraint order passed by the high court while hearing a petition challenging the constitutional validity of the subsidy. The relief, however, had been specifically for Haj 2006.

 Pointing out that the matter was still pending before the high court, the Centre had sought extension of the relief by another year to clear the position on subsidy well before the Mansarovar Yatra in June and Haj by the year-end.

 Solicitor general G.E. Vahanvati said the apex court, while allowing subsidy for Haj 2006, had requested the high court to dispose of the matter within a year but it was still pending. 

 However, it was also alleged that the government itself was responsible for the delay in proceedings before the high court as it had sought time for arguments in the matter. 

 Seeking urgent relief, the Centre said the first batch of Kailash Mansarovar pilgrims who get Rs 3,250 each from the government was likely to leave on June 1 and the first batch of Haj pilgrims, in November. 

 It was necessary to clear the position on subsidy before it starts discussing transport arrangements with Air-India and Saudi Arabian Airlines for Haj, it said.

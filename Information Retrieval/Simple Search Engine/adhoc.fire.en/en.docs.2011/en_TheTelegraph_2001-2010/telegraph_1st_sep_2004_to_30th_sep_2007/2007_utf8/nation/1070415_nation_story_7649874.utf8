 Goof-up cops mull appeal

 Mumbai, April 14: Mumbai police today said they would appeal against yesterdays order acquitting Alistair Pareira of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and initiate action against officials responsible for goofing up the case.

 The 21-year-old businessmans son, accused of killing seven pavement sleepers in a hit-and-run last November, got away lightly with a six-month term and a fine of Rs 5 lakh. The one month he has already spent in jail will be deducted from the sentence. 

 A sessions court yesterday convicted Pareira of rash and negligent driving and endangering the life of others. The more stringent charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder could not be slapped on the engineer because of lack of evidence.

 While awarding the sentence, additional sessions judge A. Mishra had criticised the police for the casually done investigations.

 Mumbai police chief Dhananjay Jadhav said a probe would soon be started. We are yet to receive a copy of the judgment. We will study the order and take strong steps against officials if any lapses are found, he said.

 Police photographer Pravin Mohite told the judge that the pictures he had taken of the hit-and-run site did not match the ones produced in court. He admitted to leaving behind his glasses, throwing doubt on his testimony. But the prosecution did not call him back for examination.

 The photographer also drove a hole in the prosecutions case by saying he was summoned to the site at 3 in the morning, whereas the incident took place at 3.45 am.

 Pareira was allegedly drunk when he was driving the Corolla, but the police could neither submit results of his blood and urine tests nor a medical certificate.

 Pareira can appeal his conviction in Bombay High Court within a month. He can move the Supreme Court if the high court turns down his plea.

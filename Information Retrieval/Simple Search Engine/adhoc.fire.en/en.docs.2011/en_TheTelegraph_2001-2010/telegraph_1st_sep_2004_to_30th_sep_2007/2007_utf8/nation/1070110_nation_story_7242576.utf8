 Family loses two to hunger

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jangipur, Jan. 9: Forced to starve for five days with no relief yet in sight, a family in a Murshidabad village is watching its members die one by one.

 Akbar Sheikh, 62, proved hardier than Anirul, 22, holding out two days longer than his young nephew till he gave up the battle this morning.

 Aniruls father Nurjen Sheikh, a 45-year-old rickshaw-puller, was fighting for his life this evening. So were Aniruls other uncle Bedarul and wife Junu Bewa.

 We have not had a morsel for the past five days, said Akbars widow Jahanara Bewa, the only one still in a condition to speak at the familys home in Kanupur, near Raghunathgunj and 260 km from Calcutta.

 Government doctors at Murshidabad Sadar Hospital said that from what they had heard, they reckoned the two men must have died of some infection.

 Akbar and Anirul had both had severe fever and a bad cough, villagers said. Its possible that their bodies, weakened by prolonged starvation that depressed their immune defences, had failed to withstand the infection.

 Since they did not consult any doctor, the infection spread and became virulent, a doctor suggested.

 Tapas Ray, health officer of Jangipur sub-division, said: I cannot comment on the incident. But well ensure that no one dies of lack of proper treatment. He promised to send a medical team to the village.

 Hashim Sheikh, the pradhan of the CPM-controlled gram panchayat, had learnt about the twin deaths from a panchayat member, Mahadeb Haldar. Its unfortunate. I was totally in the dark about the familys condition. I have written to the chief medical officer of health to provide necessary help to them.

 Villagers said the entire family had been ill for the past three weeks, none of them able to work and earn the money to buy food.

 Jahanara, whose two daughters are married, said her husband Akbar was a daily wage-earner. It had always been difficult to manage two meals from the meagre income. Then my husband fell ill and lost the strength to work.

 This should not have happened. The government has several schemes to help poor families, said Paresh Nath Das, block development officer of Raghunathgunj-I. But he added: We are trying to find out whether they were suffering from a serious disease.

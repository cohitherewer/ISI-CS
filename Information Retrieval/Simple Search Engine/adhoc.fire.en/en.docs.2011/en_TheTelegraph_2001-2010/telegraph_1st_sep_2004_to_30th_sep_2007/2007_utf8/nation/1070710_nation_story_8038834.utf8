 Srinagar, July 9: National Conference leader Omar Abdullah escaped unhurt today after militants hurled grenades at a rally at Nagham village in Handwara.

 Six persons two CRPF men, a policeman and three civilians were injured in the attack.

 Haseeb Mughal, the police chief of Handwara, 80km from Srinagar, said the militants lobbed the grenades as people were dispersing after the rally. 

 When the explosion took place, Omar sahib was sipping tea in the house of a worker. Six persons were injured and they have been shifted to hospital, Mughal said. 

 Omar said the rally was over but he had not left the venue when the rebels attacked. I was (sitting) in the lawn of an adjoining house belonging to a party worker. Suddenly, there was a big explosion, followed by gunshots. 

 My security escorted me to the house and I remained there till the all-clear signal was sounded. The last time I was attacked was two-and-a-half years ago, and the fresh attack goes to prove that the situation has remained the same during this period, he said.

 The attack has come at a time when the trouble-torn state is witnessing a surge in militancy after months of comparative calm because of the India-Pakistan peace process. 

 In May 2006, an attack on a Congress rally in Srinagar, to be addressed by chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, killed a dozen people.

 In Srinagar, demonstrations against the killing of a boy, Muntazir Ahmad, allegedly by the police, continued for the fourth day. 

 Protesters threw stones at the police, burnt tyres and erected barricades at several places in the old city. A shutdown was also observed.

 The police retaliated with tear gas shells and bamboo sticks to disperse the mob.

 Seven persons were injured, a PTI report said, adding five youths were detained.

 Muntazir, 16, died on Friday during protests against alleged human rights abuses by the forces. 

 The police today raided Ahmads residence at the Naid Kadal locality where separatist leaders and several others had assembled to pay tributes to the boy. His family said the police beat up some of those present but there were no arrests.

 NC in third front

 The National Conference has decided to join the third front. Its chief Farooq Abdullah today attended a meeting of the United National Progressive Alliance at the residence of Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh in Delhi.

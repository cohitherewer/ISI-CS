 Mumbai saga ends, another starts in Coimbatore

 M.R. VENKATESH

Coimbatore, July 31: As the 14-year Bombay blasts case draws to a close, a nine-year-old serial explosions case bearing many parallels is set to come alive tomorrow.

 A court here will deliver the verdicts in the 1998 pre-election blasts in Coimbatore that killed 58 people over four days, plunged a town in turmoil and just missed BJP leader L.K. Advani because his plane was late.

 The closest parallel with the Mumbai mayhem of 1993 is that the February 14-17 massacre here, too, was carried out as an act of revenge. 

 Police, who have blamed the fundamentalist outfit al Umma, headed by S.A. Basha, say the blasts were retaliation for the killing of 18 Muslims during riots in the textile town in late 1997.

 But unlike the Mumbai blasts, it had a specific target, too: one of the February 14 bombs went off near a dais from where Advani would have been canvassing votes for the upcoming general elections.

 The police said at least three human bombs were waiting to get Advani. Amjad Ali, Mohammed Jameshah and Amanullah are among the 166 accused along with Basith, who allegedly designed their belt bombs, and Mohammed Ansari, Bashas second-in-command.

 One way the case differs from the one in Mumbai is that none of the charges has been brought under anti-terror laws. The case started after Tada had been repealed and before the Prevention of Terrorism Act was enacted.

 Unlike the long-drawn Mumbai verdict, sessions judge K. Uthirapathy is expected to wind up by Thursday. The sentencing starts on August 6.

 Although most of the accused are from al Umma including Tajudeen who took over as its acting chief in October 1997 the most prominent is from another outfit.

 Abdul Nasser Madhani, chairman of the Kerala-based Peoples Democratic Party, is accused of helping al Umma activists receive arms training in Pakistan and sheltering some of the blasts suspects.

 He had almost sparked a parallel controversy last year when both the Left and Congress-led alliances in Kerala tried to obtain parole for him on health grounds.

 The police had arrested 168 people including some from Kerala and Andhra Pradesh and one from Calcutta but two died in custody. The main charges are murder, attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy. 

 A security blanket has enveloped the town and the courthouse for fear the verdict might reopen old wounds.

 The communal situation here had started worsening since the mid-1980s, and the 1992 Babri demolition sharpened the divide. The 97 riots were sparked by the killing of a traffic constable by al Umma.

 On the first day of the blasts, gelatin bombs hidden in cars, two-wheelers and fruit sellers push carts had struck across the town near the main bus station, at the medical college, and close to large textile and jewellery stores and a BJP office.

 Thirteen explosions that day killed 46 people, including 10 women and a child, as panicky citizens began leaving a town whose blood-soaked streets were strewn with mangled and burnt body parts.

 The blasts continued for another three days even as the police kept unearthing explosive stockpiles in hideouts. A haul of 70kg of explosives, stacked in a car near the BJP meeting venue, could have blown up half the city had it not been defused in time, the police said.

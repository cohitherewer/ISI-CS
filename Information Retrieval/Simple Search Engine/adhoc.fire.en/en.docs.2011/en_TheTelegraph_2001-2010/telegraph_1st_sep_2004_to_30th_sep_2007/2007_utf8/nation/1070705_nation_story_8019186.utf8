 Aussies stand by foreign medics

 Howard

 Melbourne, July 4 (PTI): Australian Prime Minister John Howard urged people not to persecute foreign physicians practising in the country after two Indian doctors were detained for questioning in a terror plot.

 One has since been freed without charge.

 Foreign doctors have long been an invaluable part of Australias health system, Howard said. Foreign doctors came to this country long before terrorism was an issue, he was quoted as saying by The Age. So I think we have to be careful not to jump to too many conclusions.

 Earlier, Australian Medical Association president Rosanna Capolingua defended the recruitment of internationally trained doctors. 

 It is natural for people to feel disturbed about what has happened and I am sure Australians, particularly the ones who are just encountering overseas-trained doctors and dont have a relationship with them, will feel a little anxious, Capolingua said.

 But, she pointed out, overseas-trained doctors have been an essential part of our workforce for many years. I dont want patients to be frightened to see their doctors.

 Almost 50 per cent of rural doctors in Queensland are international medical graduates and up to 5,000 are in the Australian health system, Capolingua said.

 Even before Mohammed Haneef was detained in connection with the UK terror plot on Tuesday, Queensland had had an unpalatable encounter with an Indian-born doctor. 

 Jayant Patel, a surgeon forced to surrender his licence in New York, was recruited by the Queensland health system in 2003 without proper checks on his record. Blamed for the deaths of 17 patients up to 2005, Patel was labelled Dr Death by the Australian media. He fled to the US, where he has a home, before he could be prosecuted and Australia has since been trying to have him extradited. 

 Haneefs detention was extended today but it has not been made clear if he was involved in the terror plot. Like Patel, he was recruited to fill a vacancy in an area of need, the rapidly expanding Gold Coast where Queensland Premier Peter Beattie had promised before the last poll to double the number of hospital beds. 

 Capolingua was firm today the Australian Medical Association would not launch an investigation into current recruitment practices.

 No information

 The Indian mission in Queensland said it had sought information on Haneef from police but has yet to receive any. We are just aware that the suspects name is Dr Mohammed Haneef and that he is from India, consul Savra-Daman Singh said.

 Coal crisis blacks out Bengal again 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 23: Power-starved Bengal got another jolt today when dwindling coal supply from Orissas Ib Valley led to a sharp drop in generation at state-run plants.

 The Kolaghat plant was the first to run out of coal. Generation at the Bakreswar plant suffered because it had to share coal with Kolaghat.

 The combined shortfall in the city and districts shot up to nearly 640MW this evening.

 Officials of the West Bengal Power Development Corporation, the body that oversees generation at state-run power plants, said floods in Orissa had severely affected coal supply, and the situation was not likely to improve before Monday.

 Large areas of the city, including Lake Town, Garia, Kasba and Rajdanga off EM Bypass, plunged into darkness for 45 to 90 minutes.

 In the districts, power cuts ranged between three and four hours. In East Midnapore, West Midnapore, Birbhum and Bankura, there was no power since morning.

 The West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited said the demand for power in Calcutta has gone up since the rain stopped and the mercury climbed over the past 48 hours.

 A senior official of the power development corporation said half the daily requirement of coal at the Kolaghat plant 20,000 tonnes came from Ib Valley.

 Because of the rain and floods in Orissa, railway lines have been submerged at Jharsuguda and Rourkela and coal wagons have stopped moving for the past four days. At present, we have only two days stock at Kolaghat and we have cut down generation by about 300MW, said S. Mahapatra, the managing director of the corporation.

 Power generation at the Kolaghat and Bakreswar plants had been severely affected in early July when a heavy downpour had made coal from the Eastern Coalfield mines in Asansol wet and unusable.

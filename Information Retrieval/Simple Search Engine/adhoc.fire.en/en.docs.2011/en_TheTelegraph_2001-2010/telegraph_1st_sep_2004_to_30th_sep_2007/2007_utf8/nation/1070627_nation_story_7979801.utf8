 Girl in US race row

 New York, June 26 (PTI): An Indian-American girl was denied admission to an elite public school here because of a race-based quota law established in 1974.

 Eleven-year-old Nikita Raus Indian descent came in the way of her entry into the Mark Twain School in Coney Island, as being a minority student meant attaining a higher cut-off mark in the admission test. The institution is said to attract gifted students.

 I feel bad because I would have gotten in if I were white, Nikita said. The education officials said it was unfair but added they had no choice but to follow the court order.

 The quota system was originally meant to boost enrolment of minorities. The judge had allocated 60 per cent seats for whites and 40 per cent for minority students. But Nikitas father Anjan Rau, a Brooklyn resident who came to the US from India in 1982, said the situation has changed much since 1974.

 The country believes in racial equality and we should not face this in America, he told the New York Post.

 The family said they were shocked when they found the school had denied admission to Nikita who had scored 79 in the test when white students with lower scores were admitted. She was classified as minority and needed to score at least 84.4 to be accepted, while white students with a score of 77 got in.

 The Raus all three are US citizens are considering legal steps. 

 Nikitas mother Kanchan told the New York Post that when she discussed the treatment of her daughters case with the schools regional enrolment director Paul Helfman, he said: I agree with you. Its not right, its not fair, but theres nothing I can do.

 Kanchan said her daughter reacted with surprise and shock after being told her skin colour was keeping her out of school.

 Education department spokesperson Andrew Jacob said: Although we strive to make our enrolment process as equitable as possible, we must comply with the federal court order.

 The city school system has only one other institution, in Queens, which operates under the court-mandated desegregation order that takes an applicants race into account for admissions.

 The Raus lawyer, Rosemarie Arnold, last week wrote to school officials, urging them to reconsider Nikita, calling the institutions quota system antiquated and dubbing the rejection of her client unconstitutional. 

 She pointed out that the US Supreme Court is considering a case that could end racial quotas in schools nationwide, including Mark Twain.

 Schools chancellor Joel Klein has said the education department would end the racial quota system if the Supreme Court approves it.

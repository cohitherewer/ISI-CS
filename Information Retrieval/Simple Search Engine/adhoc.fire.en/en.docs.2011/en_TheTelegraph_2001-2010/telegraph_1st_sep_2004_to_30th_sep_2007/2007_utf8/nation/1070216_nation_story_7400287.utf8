The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Maneka barks up Left tree

 Their barks are pretty loud, and they have also threatened to bite if needed. But the CPM often described as the watchdog of the UPA government was treated to bites of a different kind recently by Indias best known animal lover.

 Maneka Gandhi landed at A.K. Gopalan Bhavan, the CPM headquarters, on Monday to discuss a scheme for protecting street dogs in Kerala.

 Maneka, who met Prakash Karat for 35 minutes, wants the CPM general secretary to speak to Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan so that the scheme gets rolling.

 So what made the NDA leader visit the rival camp? Maybe, the CPMs love for canine phraseology had caught her ears.

 oon after the UPA government came to power, politburo member Sitaram Yechury had declared: We not only bark, we also bite. 

 Asked what the meeting was about, Karat said it was about dogs. But Maneka would not reveal much, only blurting out, it was nothing political.

 Piece of Persia from papa

 Natalie Mistry does not need a time machine to travel to her roots. Her father is taking her there.

 Jimmy Mistry, the 35-year-old managing director and principal designer of Della Tecnica Group, is building a lavish set recreating a part of Persepolis, an ancient town in Iran, for his eight-year-old daughters Navjote ceremony on Thursday.

 Persian dancers, musicians and chefs have been flown in for the ceremony, in which a Parsi child is initiated into the Zoarashtrian religion.

 Colabas Jeejeebhoy Dadabhoy Agiary will turn into Persepolis, giving the guests around 2,000 are expected a glimpse of the Persian empire that ruled a large part of western Asia 1,300 years before Christ. Persia was also where the Zoarashtrian religion was born.

 Mistry researched the subject for eight months to get all the details.

 Apart from the 2,000 guests, 101 priests will bless little Natalie.

 Missile for mosquitoes

 The constant buzzing of mosquitoes was getting on the babus nerves. 

 So hi-tech Hyderabad has decided to fall back on an old household practice to get rid of the menace smoke em out.

 All nooks and corners of government buildings in the city, including the Assembly, are sprayed with the Sambrani incense made from the powdered bark of a medicinal tree.

 However, on the first day of the budget session, the Sambrani smoke got a little too hyperactive. 

 Searching for the mosquitoes hideouts, it went to the legislators heads and seemed to have calmed them down.

 The House adjourned for the day without any unruly scenes despite a long-winding 90-minute address by governor Rameshwar Thakur.

 Gift of the gab

 Trust Calcuttans to win a war of words. 

 Anisha Ghosh and Rahul Vohra from St Xaviers College, Calcutta, did their city proud by winning an all-India inter-collegiate debate on Terrorism and National Security Issues at Chennais Loyola College on Tuesday. 

 Arguing for the hot-pursuit strategy, the duo said the only way out of the Kashmir conflict was destroying militant bases in Pakistan.

 Their rivals on the stage a team from the Vellore Institute of Technology prescribed the softer option of diplomatic initiatives and talks.

 But that didnt impress the jury much, and the crown went to the Xaverians.

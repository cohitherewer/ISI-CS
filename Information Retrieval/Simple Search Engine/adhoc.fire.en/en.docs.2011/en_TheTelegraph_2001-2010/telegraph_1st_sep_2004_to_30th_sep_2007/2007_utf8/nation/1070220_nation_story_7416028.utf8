 Hassle tag on visa scan 

 ASHWANI TALWAR

 New Delhi, Feb. 19: Talk of security to people in the very slow-moving visa queue outside the Pakistan high commission here, and they tell you about harassment.

 At least when Tanvir Hasan (identities changed in this report) travelled to Lahore in 2004, real security only kicked in at the Atari-Wagah border. Now, in the queue for a Pakistani visa for another trip to meet relatives, Hasan recalls that his luggage was not checked while boarding the train in Delhi.

 Once in the train, people who have done the trip before say, policemen check luggage but randomly: the customs and immigration formalities and the more thorough scans are done several hours later while boarding the next train for the Atari-Wagah stretch.

 And on the return Atari- Delhi journey, Hasan said, passengers are hassled for bribes by policemen travelling on the train. They say, what have you brought back? Give us Rs 200 or we will ask you to open up your luggage?

 Hasan says he faced similar demands by local policemen at the Lahore and Delhi railway stations. I told them to take us to the police station if they wished, we had nothing to hide, his wife tells of the Delhi station experience.

 But the bigger grouse for people outside the Pakistan high commission is the hassle of getting the Pakistani visa. 

 The queue to submit application forms begins forming early in the morning. It moves slowly and families squat on the pavements awaiting their turn. 

 Sometimes they are asked for more documents or the application needs to be referred to Islamabad, leading to more delays.

 Why dont they charge more for the visa but give us some facilities? asks Rashid Siddique from Mumbai, who would be taking a plane to Pakistan. Yusuf Raza, a friend who has accompanied him from Mumbai, didnt apply the hassle put him off though he too has relatives he wants to meet in that country.

 So does Paya Singh, around 80 and very frail. But he couldnt make it to the head of the queue today before the counters closed. And last nights train fire had something to do with that.

 Travelling from Jalandhar with hearing-impaired son Bishan Singh and daughter-in-law Pritam Kaur, Paya Singh was stranded at Kurukshetra for several hours. The railways had stopped trains on the route for some time after the fire on the Atari Special.

 So by the time the family reached the high commission, it was 12.30 pm. The counters closed a little before 2 pm.

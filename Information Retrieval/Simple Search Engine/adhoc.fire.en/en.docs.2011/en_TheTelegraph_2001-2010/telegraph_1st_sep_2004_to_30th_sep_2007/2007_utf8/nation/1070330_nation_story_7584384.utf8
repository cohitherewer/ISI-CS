 IIM Calcutta at Joka: Waiting for the government call

 Calcutta, March 29: The Supreme Court stay on the quota for OBC students means Chandan Kumars plan to shift from an elite tech school to a premier B-school would be delayed by a year. 

 The student of integrated MSc in the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur had appeared for the Common Admission Test (CAT) for the Indian Institutes of Management last year. He was shortlisted for group discussion and personal interview at IIM Calcutta. 

 Chandan was waiting for the offer letter from the Joka B-school when the court verdict came. 

 I will take up a job this year and sit for CAT again next year, he said.

 Although the OBC students are clueless about the resolution of the quota debate, a majority of them have decided to sit for CAT next year. 

 IIM Calcutta, too, is in a quandary. We were in the process of finalising the results. But now the stay order has come. We will have to wait for the government directive, said Asish Bhattacharyya, chairman, admissions, IIM Calcutta. 

 Following the government legislation providing for 27 per cent reservation for OBC students, the B-school had chalked out a three-year roadmap for a staggered increase in seats by 54 per cent. 

 The authorities had decided to increase 6 per cent seats, from 300 to 318, this year. In the next two years, seats would be increased by 30 per cent and 18 per cent. 

 We had plans to take in nine OBC students this year, said Anindyo Sen, dean, programme initiatives, IIM Calcutta. 

 Ashish Kumar, a final year BTech student of the Indian School of Mines in Dhanbad, was sure of booking his berth in IIM Calcutta. 

 Now, I will have to wait and find out what the government decides, said the boy in his early twenties. 

 I will have to appear for CAT again next year. I got a decent percentage this year, so I hope I will be able to make it again next year.

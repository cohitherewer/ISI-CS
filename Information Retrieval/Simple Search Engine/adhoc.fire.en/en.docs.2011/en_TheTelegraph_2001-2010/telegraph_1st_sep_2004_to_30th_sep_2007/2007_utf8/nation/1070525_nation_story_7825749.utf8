 Armour against bank bugbears

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 24: Next time banks shock you with a credit-card bill or deduct a fee from your account, take heart. You can fight back better.

 The RBI today unveiled a revamped ombudsman scheme to ensure that customers unhappy with banks arent left in the lurch. A far-reaching change is the inclusion of a provision that allows appeals even when complaints have been rejected. 

 Earlier, appeals were permitted only if a ruling went against the person who complained.

 The ombudsman, a quasi-judicial body, mediates complaints by summoning banks and customers. All commercial banks, regional rural banks and primary cooperative banks are covered by the scheme.

 Complaints are made over a variety of problems. These include non-payment of cheques or delays in collection and refusal to accept small-denomination notes.

 Under the Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006, complaints can also be made if a bank does not open an account without a valid reason, or if it refuses to do so outright. Even charges slapped without adequate prior notice can be taken to the authority if banks fail to justify them.

 At present, there are 15 ombudsmen, based mostly in state capitals. Usually, efforts are made to address the complaints through conciliation or mediation. Orders are passed only if the problem is not resolved mutually.

 The ombudsman can reject a complaint if it appears that the matter is beyond its powers or frivolous and mala fide. It can also be spiked on the ground of insufficient cause.

 Under the new rules, the appeals have to be filed within 30 days of the intimation from the ombudsman that the complaint has been shot down. The appeals have to be made to the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank.

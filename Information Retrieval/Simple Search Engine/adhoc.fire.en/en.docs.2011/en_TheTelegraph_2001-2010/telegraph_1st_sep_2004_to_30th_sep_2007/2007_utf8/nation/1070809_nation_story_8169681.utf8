 Cases keep a dozen generals in a limbo

 SUJAN DUTTA 

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: Nearly a dozen generals are left in limbo after a court ordered the defence ministry to keep a post for a lieutenant general vacant at army headquarters.

 The post is being kept vacant for a hopeful officer who has alleged that a cabal in army headquarters was delaying his promotion. 

 Major General R.K. Lumba of the armoured corps, an instructor in the Army War College, Mhow, has petitioned Delhi High Court, which has ordered that a lieutenant general-ranked post should not be filled up. Lumba told the court he suspected that if he won his case, army headquarters might say there was no post available for him. 

 At least seven major generals have gone to court challenging orders to deny or delay promotions. One of the cases of Major General Arun Roy (now retired) who was last posted in Eastern Command headquarters in Fort William is with Calcutta High Court. 

 The sharp pyramid at the top of the military hierarchy means that most officers, from the rank of brigadier upwards, have to retire if not found eligible for promotion. The current choke is delaying the upward movement of officers from the ranks of major general to lieutenant general. 

 The age of superannuation for major generals is 58 years and for lieutenant generals 60 years. The army chief serves up to the age of 62. There are posts for about 200 major generals in the army and 70 lieutenant generals. 

 The Cabinet Committee on Appointments has announced the next army chief two months before General J.J. Singh retires. But the inability to fill up the other posts means the defence ministry will be hard-pressed to appoint the next vice-chief. The current vice-chief, Lt General Deepak Kapur, is the army chief- designate and will take over from October 1. 

 A lieutenant general-rank post that fell vacant on August 1 is not being filled up after Lt General Utpal Bhattacharrya retired as director-general (manpower planning and personnel services) in end-July. Only one major general has been approved for promotion for the post in the staff category (ceremonies and welfare) A.K. Lamba, who is currently additional director-general. 

 But there are two contenders Major Generals K.P.D. Samanta, currently president of the Bhopal-based services selection board, and V.K. Jain, additional director-general (movements) who are also vying for the post. 

 Both, like Lamba, are from the 1969 batch. All three are from the Regiment of Artillery and are well-connected. 

 Another lieutenant general-ranked post for the director-general (supply and transport) is also vacant for nearly a year. The last DG (S amp;T), Lt General S.K. Sahni, was moved out.

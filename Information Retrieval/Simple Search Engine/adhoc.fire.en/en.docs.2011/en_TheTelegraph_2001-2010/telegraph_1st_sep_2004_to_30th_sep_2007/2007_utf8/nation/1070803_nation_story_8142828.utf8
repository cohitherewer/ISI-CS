 Priya support comes in for flak

 SANJAY K. JHA

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: Priya Ranjan Das Munshis statements in support of Sanjay Dutt are uncalled for, the BJP said today while admitting that the overwhelming sympathy for the actor is understandable.

 There is more to it than personal sympathy. It smacks of petty politics and a cabinet minister must not make such remarks when the court has done a fair trial and convicted the accused, BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.

 Das Munshi had said Sanjay has suffered enough and that he would go to prison with a garland the day the actor was freed. 

 Rudy said: Several other persons have been punished and a few of them have received death sentences. What signal does the government want to send through a cabinet minister who is speaking up for one convict?

 The overwhelming sympathy for Sanjay can be understood, Rudy said, especially in the wake of Munnabhai goodwill. But celebrity status and fan following do not guide the legal course, he said. The party though has come a long way from the early days of the Bombay blasts trial when it had condemned Sunil Dutts son as a terrorist a tag the court finally removed in November. 

 Its Mumbai ally, the Shiv Sena, had changed its stand on Sanjay after Sunil Dutt sought help from Bal Thackeray when the actor was in jail more than a decade ago. 

 The Sena mouthpiece, Saamna, today exhorted the actor not to give up hope but conceded he was only paying for bhaigiri of the past. Its sympathetic editorial pointed out that AK-47 rifles are not found in Chowpattys bhelpuri shops after all. 

 The BJP has so far avoided commenting on Sanjays sentence at its media briefings. 

 But Rudy said: If the minister has to express his views on such subjects publicly, it would be desirable if Mr Das Munshi expresses his views about Afzal Guru, too. The entire nation is waiting for the governments views on the terrorist and nobody speaks.

 Madhani uproar

 The BJP condemned the victory celebrations by Congressmen and communists at the acquittal of Abdul Nasser Madhani in the Coimbatore blasts targeting L.K. Advani. 

 In a statement issued by vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Madhani was introduced as Indias Osama bin Laden and the attitude of the Congress and the Left described as glorification of terror. 

 Keralas Peoples Democratic Party leader was acquitted yesterday .

 Passing resolutions in the Kerala Assembly by the Congress and the communist party to release Madhani, meeting Madhani in jail are proof of the fact that the UPA government and the state government have betrayed the country on this issue, the statement said.

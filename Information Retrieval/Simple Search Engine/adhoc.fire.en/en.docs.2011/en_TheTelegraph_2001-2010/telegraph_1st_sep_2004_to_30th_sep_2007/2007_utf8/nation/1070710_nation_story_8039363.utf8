 Hyderabad, July 9: Simmering discontent in the ruling Congress erupted into group clashes and landed the son of a senior leader in jail last evening, the trigger being a parking tiff.

 P. Janardhan Reddy, a former chief of the party in Andhra Pradesh, sat in protest inside a police station along with his family over the arrest of his son on assault charges.

 P. Vishnuvardhan Reddy, the state president of Congress-backed students union Nusi, has been held, along with Santosh, Janardhans son-in-law, for allegedly beating up chief minister Y.S.R. Reddys relatives over a dispute that arose over right of way.

 The incident occurred in Banjara Hills, where the families of Janardhan and Y.S. Ravindra Reddy, related to the chief minister, are neighbours. 

 The trouble began when Ravindra and son Sumadhur drove in to find the road to their house clogged with cars, apparently of guests attending a house-warming ceremony hosted by Janardhans daughter.

 Ravindra and his son were asking a car coming from the opposite direction to make way. Vishnuvardhan and Sumadhur abused each other, said ASP Ramakrishnaiah. 

 The police said both young men traded blows, but Vishnuvardhan was booked on manhandling charges. He and Santosh have been remanded in judicial custody till July 20.

 After Janardhan began the sit-in at the police station, cases were registered against Ravindra and his son, though they have not been arrested.

 As he sat inside, Janardhans supporters hit the streets, torching four government buses and damaging others. Two persons were injured when the police cane-charged the mob.

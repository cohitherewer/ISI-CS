 13 unlucky? MLA prefers it 

 JOHN MARY 

 Thiruvananthapuram, July 22: Simon Britto, a wheelchair-bound Kerala MLA, cant exactly consider himself lucky in life but he refuses to harbour a superstitious dislike of No. 13 at least until it is proved otherwise.

 Britto, nominated to the House from the Anglo-Indian quota, has been allotted room No. 12B at the legislature hostel which, with rooms for all 141 MLAs, does not have a No. 13. Britto has written to the Assembly secretary asking to be assigned a new number.

 Im a Marxist. Im not superstitious and scared of the number 13. Its unbecoming of the legislature to succumb to such unfounded fears, perhaps a western fad. Number 13 should bring as much good or bad (luck) as any other number, says Britto, a victim of campus violence.

 The fear of number 13 termed triskaidekaphobia has not been confined to the lawmakers rooms. A year ago, when the Left ministry assumed office, the housekeeping wing of the tourism department was reluctant to allot an official car, bearing the number 13, to any of the 20 ministers. But education minister M.A. Baby asked for, and eventually was allotted, such a car.

 As in many other countries, Indian buildings rarely have a 13th floor, few hotels have room No. 13 and planes skip the 13th row.

 Judges, too, cant seem to get over the fear. Kerala High Court does not have a judges chamber numbered 13.

 Last year, a Kerala resident filed a suit arguing that not having the number 13 went against the secular Constitution since it was based on a fear implicit in Christian thought.

 The court didnt take kindly to N.K. Chandramohans push for rationality and dubbed his plea frivolous, fining him Rs 10,000 for trying to malign the judges. 

 Undeterred, he appealed to the apex court.

 Such superstitious behaviour cannot be encouraged, a three-member Supreme Court bench said. It declared that there was no room for superstition in court.

 But why is 13 so scary? Five judges died in harness between 1995 and 2000, and some of them had presided over court number 13.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Valley focus at Pak talks

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, March 14: India and Pakistan today pledged to resolve all issues dividing the nations, including Kashmir, and agreed to ink four agreements to promote peace and security.

 The Indian and Pakistan foreign secretaries laid special stress on the Kashmir dispute at a joint news conference, saying this was the lingering thorn that needed to be plucked out.

 It is in our interest to resolve the issues that are dividing us, Indian foreign secretary Shiv Shanker Menon said, adding the point behind the ongoing intense efforts was to bring the Kashmir issue to its logical conclusion.

 His Pakistan counterpart, Riaz Mohammad Khan, said: It is our belief that once we are able to address this issue, it will turn a new chapter in our bilateral relations.

 The four areas on which the secretaries agreed to cooperate were: a) observing the four-year ceasefire along the Line of Control; b) speedy return of inadvertent LoC trespassers; c) no development of new posts along the LoC; d) prevention of incidents at sea.

 They also agreed on some confidence-building measures, among which are a Kargil-Skardu bus service, helicopter and postal services between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad and cross-border sports activities.

 While Menon hoped the dialogue process would resolve differences as soon as possible, Khan voiced confidence that 2007 could be a watershed year in the history of Indo-Pak relations.

 The dialogue process has seen implementation of several CBMs, narrowing of divergences and improvement in the understanding of each others positions on issues that divide the two countries, Menon said.

 But he did not forget to remind Pakistan of its commitment not to allow its territory to be used to support terror.

 I reiterate the importance of maintaining an atmosphere free from terror and violence to sustain popular support for the dialogue process, Menon said, stressing the importance of cooperation through the joint anti-terror mechanism.

 The mechanism, which held its maiden meeting in Islamabad on March 6, agreed to exchange information to help investigate terrorist acts and prevent violence in the two countries.

 The Indian delegation also proposed dates for the fourth round of talks that will be held between April-July 2007.

 This includes early meetings on Siachen and Sir Creek, Menon said.

 Asked if India had responded to Pakistani proposals handed over during the last round of foreign secretary-level talks, he said: We are looking at these ideas to see whether we can move forward.

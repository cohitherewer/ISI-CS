 NCERT plea to varsities

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 9: The National Council for Educational Research and Training has asked the University Grants Commission to allow use of university facilities during vacations to train schoolteachers. 

 Universities have to look at the role they are playing with respect to Indian education, not just higher education. The UGC will hopefully help ensure the use of university facilities during vacations, professor Krishna Kumar, the NCERT director, said today.

 He cited the example of Delhi University where no classes are held between March and July. Considering the huge need to train schoolteachers, these facilities could come in handy.

 UGC chairman professor Sukhdeo Thorat said the proposal was a good one and would be considered.

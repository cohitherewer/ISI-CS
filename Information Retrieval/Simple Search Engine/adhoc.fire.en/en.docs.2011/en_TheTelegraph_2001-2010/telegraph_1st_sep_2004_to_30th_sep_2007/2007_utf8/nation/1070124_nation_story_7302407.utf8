 Rush to police reform deadline

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 23: The Centre has convened a meeting of administrators and chief secretaries of Union territories on February 1 to review progress on police reforms. 

 The Supreme Court, which set the guidelines in October last year, wants fresh compliance reports on the issue.

 A home ministry official said the meeting will consider ways to put into practice through the model police act seven recommendations made by the court.

 Sources said the Centre wants most of the suggestions applied at least in the Union territories in the time set by judges. On January 11, the apex court asked all states as well as the Centre to comply with three of its seven proposals within four weeks, and the rest by March 31. 

 Many recommendations have run into resistance from states, which fear a loss in authority on law and order an area in which the Constitution grants them exclusive rights.

 In compliance reports filed before January 3, some states, like Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Karnataka, cited special provisions in the Constitution and practical difficulties in applying the directives.

 Most states have broadly agreed to separate crime and investigation from law and order a crucial piece of reform but have problems with other proposals. These include setting up of a security commission and police complaints authority. 

 The recommendation that directors-general and inspectors-general must have at least two years in the posts havent gone down well, either.

 The court has tossed out the objections, and said a full compliance report on the issue must be submitted by April 10.

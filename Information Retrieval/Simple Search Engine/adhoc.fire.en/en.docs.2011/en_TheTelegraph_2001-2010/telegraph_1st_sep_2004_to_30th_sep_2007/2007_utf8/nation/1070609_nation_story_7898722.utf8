 Indian convicted in UN fraud

 New York, June 8 (AP): A former UN procurement official from India was convicted today of charges that he helped a friend secure $100 million in UN contracts in exchange for a huge discount on two luxury Manhattan apartments.

 Sanjaya Bahel, 57, chief of the UNs commodity procurement section from 1999 to 2003, was convicted of bribery, wire fraud and mail fraud, charges which carry a potential penalty of up to 30 years in prison.

 Bahel, who has maintained his innocence since his arrest last November, will be kept in jail till his September 10 sentencing.

 I dont know whether there could be some scheme to have him depart from the country, said US district judge Thomas P. Griesa.

 UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon is satisfied that justice has been done, deputy spokesperson Marie Okabe said.

 Bahels one-time co-defendant, Nishan Kohli, pleaded guilty to bribery and testified against him. Kohli said his family teamed up with Bahel to expand revenue for its businesses by securing about two dozen UN contracts.

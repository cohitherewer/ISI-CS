 FIR snub spurs guard suicide

 Kannauj (PTI): A forest guard has committed suicide in front of a police station after his request for lodging an FIR against a robbery was allegedly turned down, police said.

 Govind Verma had withdrawn Rs 17,000 from a bank to pay off his loan but it was looted by miscreants on the way and the Kannauj district police in Uttar Pradesh allegedly refused to lodge the FIR on Thursday.

 A disappointed Verma then hanged himself from a tree in front of the police station, sources said.

 The incident triggered tension in the area when residents took to the streets in protest and began hurling stones. Eight vehicles were damaged. 

 The police had to fire gunshots in the air to control the crowd, a source said. 

 Jail for faking Rajiv signature

 New Delhi (PTI): A court has handed a two-year jail term to a man for forging the signature of the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

 The court upheld the conviction of Madhur Kishore Bhatnagar by a lower court and also confirmed a fine of Rs 10,000 on him for fabricating a letter with forged signature of the then Prime Minister which was posted to the President in July 1985.

 The letter contained a purported demand of Rs 80 lakh by Rajiv Gandhi from one D.K. Jain, an inspector at the State Bank of India, and was posted with an intention to harm his reputation, the CBI said. 

 Copies of the letter were also sent to few newspapers for giving it wide publicity, the bureau alleged.

 Cruel wife

 Chennai (PTI): A 72-year-old man has been granted divorce from his second wife for being subjected to mental and physical torture, a decade after a lower court had rejected his plea.

 Viswanathan married Lakshmi in 1992. In his petition, he charged her with subjecting his mother, son and himself to constant harassment and torture .

 Witch hacked

 Dahod (PTI): A man has allegedly hacked to death an elderly relative after accusing her of being a witch in Gujarats Dahod district. The 65-year-old was found with her neck chopped off on Thursday. The man had blamed her for his falling health, police said. 

 Dowry killing

 Kanpur (PTI): An army jawan has been sentenced to life term for killing his wife for dowry. Kamlesh Kumar Singh had demanded Rs 50,000 and a motorcycle from his wife. After being refused, he slit her throat in 2004.

The decade-long militancy in Kashmir has helped the wildlife grow manifold, officials said. The average increase in the population of animals and birds has been found to be 20 to 60 per cent.

 Iran welcome

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: India today received a special envoy of Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in an attempt to balance its perceived pro-America tilt, even as its navy participated in ambitious exercises along with the US in the Bay of Bengal.

 Iran deputy foreign minister Mehdi Safari met both foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and national security adviser M.K. Narayanan, an unusual event in itself.

 The Iranian side had asked for both calls, but the protocol-conscious foreign ministry is usually loath to allow the senior Indian leadership anywhere near junior ministers.

 Under normal circumstances, the Iran deputy minister would only have been allowed to meet foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon, which he did.

 However, since Indias two anti-Iran votes at the International Atomic Energy Agency over the last couple of years have substantially added to the political heavy weather, Delhi felt that allowing Safari to see Mukherjee and Narayanan might allay some of the Lefts misgivings.

 Safaris single-point agenda was to seek Indian support ahead of next weeks IAEA meeting in Vienna on the timetable Iran has set for itself in collaboration with the agency in the last fortnight on slowing uranium enrichment for its nuclear weapons programme.

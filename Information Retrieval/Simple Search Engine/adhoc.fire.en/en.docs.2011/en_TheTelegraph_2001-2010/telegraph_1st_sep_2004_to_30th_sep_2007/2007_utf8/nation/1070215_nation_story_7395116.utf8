 Speedy jobs for B-brains

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Feb. 14: A batch of 118 students placed in less than 18 hours with 34 top-notch companies. 

 Speed was the key word at the annual placements for the class of 2007 at the Vinod Gupta School of Management as India Inc. scooped up the best of the B-brains.

 The placements of the final batch of 2007 which came to a close saw the entire batch getting jobs over two days 18 hours to be precise, said Kunal Nagar, a first-year student at the IIT Kharagpur management school.

 Thirty-five per cent bagged jobs in the information technology sector followed by consultancy (19 per cent), finance (18 per cent) and marketing (17 per cent).

 The average salary increased by 20 per cent from last year to Rs 8.78 lakh a year. The highest offer more than Rs 13 lakh per annum was made to three students.

 All the placements were for the domestic market as IIT Kharagpur unlike the Indian Institutes of Management and some other B-schools does not allow foreign placements. But that did not stop exciting profiles like equity research and treasury and investment banking from coming in the way of the budding managers. 

 PricewaterhouseCoopers offered profiles in its prestigious government reforms and institutional development division. Aricent (a communication software company), ITC, Hutch and RPG Retail offered some of the most coveted profiles in sales, marketing, merchandising and branding. 

 Apart from regular recruiters like IBM and Wipro, the campus also had several first-time visitors like Ernst amp; Young, Hutch and Cognizant Technology Solutions. 

 The most important thing about this years placement is that there were takers for our students across all sectors. We have introduced courses on retail, real estate and some high-end financial management, and the placements proved the success of these programmes, said Gautam Sinha, head, training and placements, IIT Kharagpur.

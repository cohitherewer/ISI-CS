 Strike over, not troubles

 New Delhi, June 14: The Indian strike has been called off but the airline is bracing for a passenger backlash and rivals are smacking lips at a possible shift in loyalties.

 Low-cost carriers Air Deccan and SpiceJet are believed to have benefited the most from the troubles of Indian, which had to cancel 100 flights today, 40 more than yesterday.

 We put most of Indians passengers on the two carriers, especially on the eastern and north-eastern routes, said Debashish Chatterjee of CTI Travels.

 Indian has a market share of 21 per cent, lower than Kingfisher-Air Deccans 29 per cent and Jet-Saharas 30 per cent. 

 The biggest casualty could be passenger confidence. There is a perception that Indians pilots and engineering are better. But the strike will change such notions and other carriers will benefit, at least in the short run, said Sudipto Bose, an airline industry analyst.

 Last year, Air Deccan flew past Indian in terms of market share. The state-run carrier has achieved some success in regaining the lost ground, but the strike could undo the good work. 

 In businesses like hotels and airlines, perceptions are quite important, Bose said. 

 Earlier in the day, the strike was called off after union leaders hammered a deal for faster promotions and payment of arrears due to them over a period of two-and-a-half years. The urgency to reach a deal increased after the cabin crew began walking off duty to join the striking baggage loaders, clerks and back-office staff.

 All our major demands have been met, said J.K. Badola, general secretary of the Air Corporation Employees Union. His key demands were wage arrears and a fast-track promotion scheme similar to the one at Air India.

 Trade union leaders from the Left pitched in. We called up Praful Patel and asked him to see that talks were initiated. Strikes that paralyse communications have to be brought to a quick end, the CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta said.

 Trinamul leader Mamata Banerjee also made a last-minute intervention. Her MP Dinesh Trivedi went along with the striking union leaders to broker peace at Rajiv Gandhi Bhavan, which houses the civil aviation ministry.

 Last night, the stand-off appeared to be heading for the worse when civil aviation minister Patel decided to take a tough stand by suspending 27 employees. Todays agreement puts them back on their jobs.

 Delhi High Court dubbed the strike prima facie illegal. The court asked employees to resume duty at the earliest and restrained them from staging demonstrations, indulging in sloganeering or other modes of protest within 200 metres of the Delhi airport. 

 The workers were also told not to restrain passengers from visiting Indian offices. The Calcutta airport, where cabin crew joined the strike last night, was the worst hit.

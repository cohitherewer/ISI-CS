 Ompora, Budgam, Dec. 31: A dream older than a century, after 60 years of indecision and halted plans, will roll on Kashmirs tracks in a few months. 

 A train, the first to link the Kashmir valley with the rest of the country, will chug 36 km from Kakapora in the south to Ompora in central Kashmir in March if all goes well.

 We are expecting to make the train service operational (between Kakapora and Ompora) by the end of March, said Banu Prakash, the deputy chief engineer of Northern Railway. However, inclement weather may delay the rollout by a month or two. The deadline for the full 290-km stretch is 2009.

 After the first-phase run, by August, we are adding 20 km and by the end of next year (2007), another 18 km will be added, said a senior officer at the Indian Railways Constructions Company (Ircon), which is laying a 120-km track. 

 Two of the trains six bogies have reached Kashmir by road. But one has got stuck on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway after landslides, the senior Ircon officer said. Three other bogies and a locomotive will come after the weather improves.

 The project was first proposed by Dogra ruler Maharaja Pratap Singh in 1898. He had wanted a rail link to Srinagar, but no headway was made. 

 After the Partition disconnected Jammu from the countrys rail grid in 1947, there was a plan to construct a link via Pathankot in Punjab, to be extended to Kashmir later. A preliminary survey was done but the project was shelved due to the huge cost involved. 

 Then in 2001, then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee declared the proposed rail link to Kashmir a national project. 

 Right now, a three-km road at Rawalpora on the Kakapora-Ompora stretch is incomplete due to problems of land acquisition, the senior Ircon official said. But we will be able to complete the work in time. 

 Ircon is also facing some difficulty acquiring a 12-km stretch at Baramulla. This road passes through orchards and people are reluctant to give us land, the official said. 

 The Rs 11,000-crore project envisages laying tracks from Udhampur in Jammu to Baramulla in north Kashmir, the entire 290-km route. Now, trains end at Udhampur. 

 The most difficult job is to lay the 130-km Katra-Qazigund track, Prakash said. Work on the stretch, undertaken by Konkan Railway, involves construction of 80 tunnels, including one that will run for 12 km the longest in India. 

 Besides this, we are constructing a 1.3-km bridge on the river Chenab at a height of 359 m from the riverbed. This will be the highest railway structure in the world, a senior Ircon officer said. 

 The project has given employment to thousands from the region, many as engineers. Sarwar Sayeed, one of the engineers, is grateful. I am working here for last two years and am happy to earn money and expertise. 

 The Ircon officers say they have allotted work in Kashmir to 200 contractors, each of whom has engaged dozens of people. More than 80 per cent of work has been allotted to locals, an official said. Also, more than Rs 550 crore has been sanctioned for the land acquired by us.

 Outsiders, too, have benefited. Harpreet Singh, a labourer from Gurdaspur in Punjab, said he is getting a salary of Rs 4,500. In Punjab, I get Rs 80 a day but here I get Rs 150. That is why I will work here in winter despite the severe cold.

 In addition to the tracks, 500 km of roads will be constructed to access the rail links from various places and this is coming as an additional blessing to many villages that never had roads.

 Abdul Rasheed, a shopkeeper from Ompora, is a happy man. The government paid me Rs 12 lakh for my land at Humhama which costs Rs 30 lakh. This is a loss but there is hope that I will see a train here in my lifetime, he said.

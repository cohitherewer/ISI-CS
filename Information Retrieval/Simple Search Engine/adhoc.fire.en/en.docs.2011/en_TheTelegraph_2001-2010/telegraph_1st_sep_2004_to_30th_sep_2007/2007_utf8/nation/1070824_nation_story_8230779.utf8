 Political heat puts retail in Maya freezer

 Lucknow, Aug. 23: The Mayavati government today shut down all new-age retail stores selling farm products in the state, including 20 Reliance Fresh outlets and several Spencers stores opened yesterday, in the face of violent protests led by the Samajwadi Party.

 The government, which has been encouraging big companies to enter the retail sector, attributed todays decision to law-and-order problems after protesting traders ransacked two Reliance outlets yesterday in Lucknow and Varanasi.

 In view of the protests, it was felt there was a need to review the policy, the chief minister told reporters.

 Taken by surprise, Reliance and the RPG-promoted Spencers said they were willing to cooperate. Company sources joined political observers in suggesting that the government was merely buying time so the protests would cool off.

 Reliance retail stores sell farm products in many states, including Jharkhand where it had faced a bout of violence, and Spencers is not known to have faced problems anywhere.

 The Mayavati government, seen as friendly to the Mukesh Ambani-promoted Reliance, however, formed a committee to review its retail policy.

 The principal secretary to the chief minister, Shailesh Krishna, said that after the committee hands in its report in a month, the government would amend the retail policy if required. Few here, however, expect any major changes.

 Mayavati also froze her two-week-old approval to contract farming, a policy that has prompted the threat of a massive farmers agitation by the Samajwadi Party, which alleges the move is meant to favour Reliance.

 Intelligence inputs say violence is likely against retail outlets and their employees, Krishna said.

 Reliance Fresh had opened 10 outlets in Lucknow and 10 in Varanasi yesterday, and Spencers had inaugurated four stores in the state capital. Traders led by Samajwadi MP Banwari Lal Kanchal demonstrated before the outlets and attacked two Reliance Fresh stores.

 Reliance plans to open retail outlets in seven state cities, including 20 in Varanasi, on August 27. Spencers is planning outlets in 10 cities.

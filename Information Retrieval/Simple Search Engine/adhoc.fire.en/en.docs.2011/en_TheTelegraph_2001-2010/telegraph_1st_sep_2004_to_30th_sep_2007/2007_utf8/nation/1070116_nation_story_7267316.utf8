 New Delhi, Jan. 15: Mayavati accepted the birthday bouquets, but not requests for an alliance in the Uttar Pradesh polls. She took the best wishes, but gave nobody her word.

 Celebrations for the 51st birthday of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief were muted except the elephant and a huge birthday cake but the hints from guests wishing her couldnt have been louder.

 Congress chief Sonia Gandhi greeted her on phone. BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi put in an appearance at her residence, a bouquet in hand, early in the day.

 But the BSP boss wasnt swayed. There is no question of any alliance either with the Congress or the BJP. The party will contest the Assembly elections alone, Mayavati told the party leaders and ticket-seekers who queued up all day to greet behenji.

 Previous birthdays have been big occasions for celebration among the party workers and leaders. But what has really taken the cake at these parties is the presents that arrive for her. The BSP chief has repeatedly used the occasion to ask members to raise funds.

 Today was Arthik Sahayta Divas, in which the BSP sympathisers were asked to give voluntary donations. Last year, her birthday was called Swabhimaan Diwas, when funds were raised through specially printed coupons. Sources said the targets varied across party ranks.

 Mayavati justifies the fund-raising drive, saying it was one of the last wishes of her mentor and BSP founder Kanshi Ram. Kanshi Ram had told me when he was in hospital on October 14, 2004 that this tradition (fund raising) should continue after my death, Mayavati said after slicing through a huge cake at the BSP office this evening.

 The celebrations had been kept low key the coupons were also missing to avoid any fresh controversy ahead of elections, the first for the BSP after Kanshi Rams death.

 But unlike the past, her birthday bash was more decentralised. In every Uttar Pradesh constituency, party workers cut cakes weighing 1.5 tonnes, she declared. That wasnt small, but Mayavati couldnt have settled for less.

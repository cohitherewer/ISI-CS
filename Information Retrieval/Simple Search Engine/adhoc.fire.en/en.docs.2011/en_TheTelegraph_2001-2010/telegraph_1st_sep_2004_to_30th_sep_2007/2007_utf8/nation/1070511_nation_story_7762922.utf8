 Gift bomb rips assam clinic

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jorhat, May 10: 

 After car, motorbike and cycle bombs, Assam today got a 

 taste of gift-wrapped terror.

 A plastic bag containing three packets of potato chips and a gift box exploded near the reception counter of a diagnostic clinic in the heart of Sivasagar town, minutes after a woman who was seen carrying it slipped out unnoticed. Five persons were wounded in the explosion.

 The Sanjivani Diagnostics Centre, where the explosion occurred at 1.20 pm, is in the busy Amolapatty locality of the town.

 Police said the woman in her mid-twenties came to the pharmacy attached to the clinic around 1 pm and asked for medicines to cure a headache. 

 Sujit Bahati, son of clinic owner Rama Bahati, said there was no reason to suspect that the innocent-looking girl had a sinister plan. 

 Sujit said he had gone to the laboratory to get his blood pressure checked when the explosion occurred. 

 I had been feeling uneasy and left the pharmacy moments before the explosion. None of our employees suspected that the bag the woman had left at the counter contained a bomb. One of them kept the bag on the floor, thinking the woman would come back for it soon, he said.

 Two employees manning the pharmacy, Dipak Rajbongshi and Palash Chetia, were among those wounded in the blast. The other three Sanjoy Kumar Deka, Tulumoni Gogoi and Dolon Gogoi were customers. 

 All five were admitted to Sivasagar Civil Hospital. Doctors said they are out of danger.

 The banned Ulfa had sent an SMS to the owner of the diagnostics centre about a month ago, demanding a huge amount of money. The sender had identified himself as Ram Singh, a sergeant major in Ulfas 28th Battalion. 

 The police confirmed that several other businessmen in Sivasagar town had received similar messages from Ulfa. 

 The owner of Supreme Glass India, a shop near the diagnostics centre, was threatened with dire consequences if he did not pay up. 

 Deputy commissioner K.K. Dwivedi urged the residents to be extra cautious, now that Ulfa has shown that it can stoop so low as to plant a bomb in a diagnostic clinic.

 In the past six months, as many as 17 improvised explosive devices (IEDs), Ulfas preferred terror weapon, have been found planted at different places in Sivasagar. 

 Last night, the army detected a powerful bomb at Kali Mandir in Simaluguri town of Sivasagar district. A bomb squad from the armys Dinjan base defused it today.

 Murders at home shock Mumbai

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 13: Mumbai is becoming increasingly unsafe for women who stay alone at home, with two murders in the city over the last four days.

 Olive Aloysis Miranda, 84, was strangled to death yesterday by unidentified assailants using a mosquito net and a sweater when she was alone at her bungalow in Bandras Chimbai village. Her body was found this morning. Her son and daughter live in London.

 A similar incident took place in suburban Borivali, where Aruna Kothwade, 42, a homemaker who, like Miranda, was alone in her second-floor flat in Silver Oak Apartments when two robbers stabbed her to death on January 10. Her husband, Ravindra Kothwade, a manager with Reliance Energy, was at work. Her two sons live in Australia.

 Investigations have revealed that Kothwade was murdered by two men, one of whom stabbed her with a knife before her 100 neighbours even as she was crying for help, police said.

 She was stabbed at least 10 times in the chest and abdomen. The robbers then removed her gold chain and bangles worth Rs 25,000 and stole Rs 1,000 before walking out through the front door and running away in front of the crowd outside.

 In Mirandas case too, police said the house had been ransacked and robbery is suspected as the motive behind the murder. However, they have not been able to ascertain what has been stolen from her home yet.

 May 7: The Gujarat fake encounter net has snared three policemen, including an inspector who allegedly fired at Sohrabuddin Sheikh.

 The three belonging to the anti-terrorism squad were identified as inspector N.H. Dabhi, Ajay Parmar and Sant Ram Sharma, CID sources said. The number of arrested policemen has now touched six.

 Dabhi has been accused of firing three rounds at Sohrabuddin, who was falsely charged with plotting to assassinate chief minister Narendra Modi, during a fake encounter on the outskirts of Ahmedabad in November 2005.

 Parmar was the personal assistant to IPS officer Rajkumar Pandian, already in custody, when he was a superintendent in the anti-terror squad. Sharma is a constable.

 The three charged with abduction, illegal confinement and murder are likely to be produced in court tomorrow for remand.

 They are also suspected to have played an important role in the killing and disposing of the body of Sohrabuddins wife Kauser Bi, who was a witness to the fake encounter.

 The arrests come after interrogation of DIG (border range) D.G. Vanzara, who headed the ATS, Pandian and Rajasthan superintendent of police Dinesh M.N. PTI quoted CID sources as saying that one of the three IPS officers was present when the body of Kauser Bi was disposed of.

 In Delhi, the Congress demanded fool-proof security for Vanzara while he is in police custody as there was threat to his life. The party said it was a part of a larger conspiracy to polarise the polity before the Assembly elections in November this year.

 Congress spokesperson Satyavrat Chaturvedi alleged that his party had information that chief minister Narendra Modi, his cabinet colleagues and political associates had plotted to kill Vanzara by a hired Muslim. 

 The intention, he said, was to drive home how a police officer out to battle terrorists had been done to death by a Muslim, thus heightening communal tensions. I am saying all this with full responsibility, Chaturvedi said.

 He said Vanzara should be tried and punished legally.

 Sources said that Gujarat being an extremely sensitive matter about which Sonia Gandhi was deeply concerned, Chaturvedi could not have publicly levelled such charges without a go-ahead from the leadership.

 His statements signal our intent to be more aggressive in our attacks against the BJP and Modi, said a source.

 Houses stalled

 The Gujarat fake encounters rocked Parliament today, forcing a daylong adjournment in the Rajya Sabha and disruptions in the Lok Sabha.

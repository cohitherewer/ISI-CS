 AIIMS draws bias charge

 More trouble

 New Delhi, Jan. 14 (PTI): A scheduled caste student who raised the issue of discrimination against reserved category students at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has alleged that he has been intentionally failed in the final MBBS examination because he spoke out against the authorities.

 After Ajay Kumar Singh wrote a letter to Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss and University Grants Commission chairman S. Thorat, who is also heading a committee to look into discrimination and harassment of reserved category students at AIIMS, he has been allowed to sit for a re-examination.

 Singh received the letter yesterday from the AIIMS administration officer R.K. Dabral stating that the re-examination will not be counted as an attempt nor will it be quoted as precedent in future.

 He has now written another letter to AIIMS director P. Venugopal and dean, academics, R.C. Deka, demanding re-examination under the dean and that the papers be checked by an impartial panel.

 He was failed with malicious intentions. This was done as he was the main person who had raised the issue of discrimination against reserved category doctors on the campus during the anti-reservation stir, said R.K. Prasad, spokesman of the Progressive Medicos and Scientists Forum.

 Deka said they would take a positive decision. This is a serious matter. As it was a special case and different from others, I recommended to the director that the examination should be convened separately and there should be independent observers to assess the situation.

 Deka added that the director has permitted setting up of a panel of independent observers for the re-examination. We wanted to remove doubts from students minds. We dont want to look as if we are biased, vindictive and discriminatory, he said, adding the order to this effect would be issued soon.

 But Prasad asked how a student who has been scoring good marks in previous examinations could fail. How can a person who cleared his pre-professionals (before the main exams in December last year) in November fail in just one months time? he asked.

 Singh had come to know that he would be failed but had not heeded rumours. Even his examiners had asked him what he had told Thorat, he said.

 Prasad said they had given a representation to the director and he had agreed that the re-examination would be held under the supervision of the dean, academics, and a new set of examiners would check the answer sheets, he said. But Saturdays letter has no mention of these two demands.

 Singh, in his letter last month to Ramadoss, had said he was deliberately failed and should be allowed to appear in an exam, which should not be considered as an attempt.

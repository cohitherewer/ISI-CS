 Cabs for women, by women

 ANANYA SENGUPTA

 Mumbai, Feb. 6: Women can soon feel a lot safer travelling alone on Mumbais roads.

 Come March 8, International Womens Day, and the city will have its first call-a-cab service exclusively for women passengers, with the taxis driven only by women.

 The service, Forsche (a take on for she), is the brainchild of 47-year-old Revathi Siddharth Roy, who says she is overbooked already by hotels, corporate houses, travel agencies and other businesses.

 Being a woman, I can well imagine the difficulties women face when they travel in taxis driven by men. Sometimes the driver stares at you through the rear-view mirror; sometimes he keeps chewing gutka and spitting. I thought why should women tolerate all this? says the mother of three who recently lost her husband.

 Roy, who has acquired 25 air-conditioned taxis, has more than 300 applicants for drivers jobs to choose from.

 The response has been overwhelming. Most applicants are 40-plus women who are bored with their daily chores. They are all efficient drivers who drive their kids to school every day, and all have at least five years experience of driving on Mumbais roads. I am planning to have health insurance for them.

 The drivers will be in uniform and the taxis will sport a combination of lavender and pink, rather like a similar service opened in Dubai this January 1. But would-be passengers looking for safe late-night travel may be disappointed to know that the Mumbai-to-Thane taxi service will close at 8 pm every day. 

 Roy, however, is certain the business will be a success, for more and more hotels are opting for women-only floors and women-oriented services. Forsche will be catering to women tourists travelling alone. 

 The idea wasnt born out of business sense alone Roy, a rally driver herself, is passionate about driving. She claims to know Mumbai like the back of her hand.

 If you tell me the name of any building in Mumbai, I shall be able to tell you which road it is on. I plan to open branches in other cities and turn this into an industry, with a BPO taking care of the bookings. My charges will be high.

 Forsche has already been booked for several weddings. It will be driving the women of the families to and from the venue.

 As she gears up to launch the venture, the person Roy misses the most is her husband, who died after being in a coma for two years. 

 My friends have been very supportive. They have told me they would drive the cars till I am able to hire drivers, she says. My dream is to one day drive the likes of Cherie Blair and Hillary Clinton when they come to India.

 Skeletons scare hometown 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Jan. 2: Neighbours of Moninder Singh Pandher in Chandigarh are locking up their homes and going away either to relatives houses or on a holiday after rumours surfaced that his Sector 27B residence could be dug up to look for skeletons.

 We are very worried now. Even if the lawns do not throw up skeletons, it will have a nightmarish effect on our children. It is difficult to conceive that we had a devil living amid us, a neighbour shuddered.

 Moninder and his servant Surendra were arrested after remains of children were found from the drain outside his Noida house. He is suspected to have sexually abused the children and had them killed.

 The neighbours in Chandigarh Moninders wife and son live here chose not to comment on the family. We do not wish to witness anything or say anything. The mere thought is nauseating, one said, while leaving in his vehicle with his children for a relatives house. 

 Most have tried to keep their children away from newspapers and television, where news of the Noida serial killings is dominant. There should be some control on the visuals. Our children are talking about it everywhere, on the telephone with their friends, in the club, with the servants. It can leave a bad impression on their psyche, said another resident who lives a block away from Moninders house.

 Gurmeet Singh Chawla, a doctor, agreed: What the children are watching and hearing on the Noida horror, though educative, is potentially very harmful. Children are like flowers and need the confidence, strength and support of society in order to blossom and bloom. 

 Incidents of this kind, in which pictures of limbs and bones are entering every household, can lead to psychological disorders among children at a later stage. Some could even begin mistrusting their parents, he warned.

 They could lead to psychological disorders and even fear psychosis among children. But at the same time they could be educative also. All the schools in the country should do some counselling and try to teach children to beware of strangers, he said. 

 Another doctor said the best way to avoid psychological disorders in children is to keep them preoccupied with other things to ensure that faith in their elders is not shaken. 

 Although there is no suggestion that the childrens remains will be sent here for testing, the Central Science Forensic Laboratory is ready in case it is asked.

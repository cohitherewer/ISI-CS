 New Delhi, Aug. 11: The Prime Ministers tough stand against the Left on the nuclear deal has delighted the BJP, but it has chosen to react with caution given the reluctance of the communists to precipitate the crisis.

 Responding to Manmohan Singhs exclusive interview in The Telegraph, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said the Lefts notorious duplicity and hypocrisy right from the days of the freedom movement are well known.

 Will the Left show courage to bite and not just bark? What will they do after the Prime Ministers remark? We are sure they will meekly surrender as they want to enjoy power without accountability, he added.

 In the interview, Singh had said it was not possible to renegotiate the deal with the US. It is an honourable deal, the cabinet has approved it, we cannot go back on it. I told them (the Left) to do whatever they want to do, if they want to withdraw support, so be it...

 BJP sources said senior leaders were monitoring the developments and the initial assessment was the Left would register a token protest and even try to mobilise people on the anti-American plank but would not do anything significant inside Parliament. 

 However, the sources added, the situation has become volatile after Singhs decision to call the Lefts bluff.

 The BJP had planned to raise the deal issue in a big way, primarily to embarrass the Left, and now it has got a happy hunting ground in the form of tense relations between the government and the Marxists.

 The party was yesterday a little upset as the Left had sent a notice for discussion under Rule 193, which does not entail voting. 

 Party leader Vijay Kumar Malhotra rubbed salt into the Lefts wounds by saying the CPM and the CPI were the committed opposition which will bail out the government in any crisis.

 The sources said the BJP was planning to mention the Lefts threats and the Prime Ministers counter-attack during the parliamentary debate and argue that Singhs latest remark had generated a sense of instability.

 Monica cry on peek show

 Aug. 24: The Supreme Court today restrained TV channels and newspapers from carrying purported nude photographs of Monica Bedi, shot allegedly with a hidden camera in a bathroom at Bhopal Central Jail.

 A TV channel had yesterday showed some such photographs, which left Monica horrified and pained, the actor said at her home in Punjabs Hoshiarpur.

 Monica had spent seven months in the Bhopal jail before being acquitted in a passport forgery case last month. Her petition said that if the charge of hidden cameras was correct, the Centre and the Madhya Pradesh government would be liable to pay exemplary costs.

 If the pictures were morphed, the channel should pay damages for failing to verify their authenticity before airing them, the petition told the court, where Monica was represented by K.T.S. Tulsi.

 Monicas lawyer in Bhopal, P.C. Vedi, had been the first to allege last month that she was being filmed secretly by CCTVs in jail.

 It raised a furore, with Madhya Pradesh Congress spokesman Manak Aggarwal seeking jail minister Antar Singh Aryas resignation. He alleged the pictures were being sold as MMS clips.

 Arya had then said that if a CCTV was indeed monitoring Monica in jail, it would be removed. The jail authorities denied the charge but today, after a local Hindi daily published some pictures, they declined comment.

 A senior police officer said CCTVs are usually placed in corridors or other parts of jails outside the barracks. If any special arrangement is needed, the inmate should have been informed.

 Monica was at jail from December 4, 2006, to July 16, 2007. 

 A few months ago, two Congress MLAs had discussed her looks and wardrobe in the Assembly, wondering how she was growing ever more attractive while behind bars.

 On September 3, Monica is to appear before a Bhopal court where her acquittal has been challenged.

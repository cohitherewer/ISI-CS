 London, Aug. 7: Lady luck has, alas, not favoured Sugal amp; Damani, the Indian company which challenged the incumbent, Camelot, for the right to run UKs high profitable National Lottery for the next 10 years. 

 Instead, fortune favoured Camelot, which has had responsibility for operating the National Lottery since it was established in 1994. Since then the lottery has raised an estimated 19 billion for good causes. 

 It is estimated that out of the UKs 60 million population, 70 per cent of those above the legal age of 16 spend on average 3 a week playing the lottery in the hope of becoming multi-millionaires. By December last year, the lottery had created its 2,000th millionaire. 

 Nevertheless, in a statistical sense, the lottery represents the triumph of hope over reality. The poorest spend the most. 

 Camelot and Sugal amp; Damani were the only two bidders in the field when the bidding process closed in February and today it was announced that Camelot had won and will have the licence to carry on for 10 years when the present one expires on January 31, 2009. 

 Despite being defeated, however, Sugal amp; Damani was not disgraced. It received a pat on the head from Anne Wright, one of the commissioners on the National Lottery Commission. 

 Although the contract will be awarded for the third successive occasion to Camelot later this month subject to the formalities being completed, Wright said Sugal amp; Damani had shown itself to be capable of running the lottery and had been identified as a reserve bidder. This means that if for any reason the contract with Camelot is not signed, the job will be given to Sugal amp; Damani. 

 Wright said: We are pleased to have had two such experienced and professional operators competing for the bid. Following a hard-fought competition, we have unanimously agreed to select Camelot Plc as the preferred bidder. 

 She added: We have been able to appoint Sugal amp; Damani as the reserve bidder, who we can appoint to run the lottery in the event that a licence cannot be finalised with Camelot. Both bidders can be proud of their organisations and all the people who have worked with them to create such exciting and innovative proposals. 

 It is understood that a key element of Camelots winning bid was its proposal for a new, worldwide mega-lottery which will create up to 100 millionaire winners per month. 

 The World Lottery Draw will offer a multi-million-pound annual jackpot in addition to monthly draws, the proposal said. It will involve existing lottery operators in America, Australasia and Europe. It is set to involve individual numbers being drawn separately in six or seven locations around the globe, then broadcast on TV and online. 

 Todays announcement by the commission, which regulates the lottery, ends a bidding process which has cost both firms hundreds of thousands of pounds and many months of work. Both bidders were ultimately judged on the amount of money which they will raise for good causes. 

 Wright said Camelots bid predicted ticket sales of 79 billion, of which 22 billion would be returned to good causes. This compared with Sugal amp; Damanis 63.9-billion sales, with 17.9 billion going to good causes. 

 Robert Foster, project board chairman at the commission, emphasised that both bids had been rigorously assessed. A key factor at the end of the day was the likelihood of increased sales which is obviously going to mean even more money for good causes, commented Foster. 

 Camelots chief executive officer, Dianne Thompson, admitted she was thrilled at the outcome and said: I am particularly pleased for all our staff who put more than 50,000 working days into writing the best possible bid. 

 Kamlesh Vijay, the boss of the Delhi-based Sugal amp; Damani, told BBC Radio Five Live that his company was disappointed by the outcome.

 Mom with cancer put on pyre

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Dark days

 Hyderabad, Feb. 3: Padmavatis family had brought her to hospital to die. But when the cancer-stricken 75-year-old surprised everyone by starting to recover, her son and relatives decided to take no more chances.

 Cancer had failed them, fire surely wouldnt.

 After the sick woman was discharged from hospital, her family took her to the crematorium in an ambulance and tried to burn her alive, said Visakhapatnam (rural) police chief J.G. Murali.

 Padmavati is a traders widow from a village near Gajuwaka, a satellite town of Visakhapatnam. Her son and two daughters are well-off but were reluctant to pay for her treatment, the police said.

 After a doctor in their village declared there was no hope for the patient, her family brought her to Visakhapatnams King George Hospital last week, expecting this to be her last journey.

 But she was discharged from the ICU after two days. After a long debate among themselves, her relatives decided what they would do, an officer said.

 The crematorium staff didnt suspect anything because the severely ill Padmavati was in a stupor.

 The body was garlanded and lifted on to the pyre. Every ritual was solemnly performed while the relatives put on expressions of mourning, some of them even contriving to shed a few tears.

 Another two minutes and her son would have lit the pyre, but Padmavati surprised her family again. She began stirring, giving onlookers the goose pimples.

 As understanding dawned on the shocked crematorium staff, Padmavatis relatives realised the game was up and fled.

 Bystanders helped shift the ailing woman to a bench on the cremation ground, where she lay till evening while the staff debated whether to inform the police.

 Perhaps fearing police action, her relatives returned to the funeral ground. Faced with the staffs anger, they apologised and took the woman home.

 Pressed, the police told The Telegraph they were investigating the matter but wouldnt commit themselves on what action they might take.

 There have been several reports in Andhra Pradesh about the aged and ailing being left to die at cremation grounds by their well-off children who are either unwilling to spend on their treatment or have been eyeing their property. This, however, is the first known attempt to burn such a parent alive.

 At the other end of the spectrum, many elderly patients are abandoned in bus stands, crematoriums and railway stations by their impoverished families who cannot afford the treatment or live in remote areas without hospitals.

 We receive reports of aged people dying on railway platforms and at bus terminals almost every day, a police officer said.

 Nudge for Reliance licence

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Calcutta, April 7: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today told Forward Bloc leaders that there was no legal ground for denying licence to the Reliance group for procuring agriculture products from farmers, according to CPM sources.

 At a meeting with agriculture marketing minister Mortaza Hossain and other Bloc leaders at Alimuddin Street, the chief minister asked them to issue the licence before Reliance compels the government to do so through court, a CPM source said.

 The Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance wants to source products from farmers for its upcoming Rs 2,000-crore retail network.

 The Forward Bloc is opposed to the Reliance venture, saying it would hit small retailers and adversely affect agriculture growth. 

 Ambani had met Bhattacharjee in June last year and announced the proposal.

 The government was initially in favour of offering land for retail shops, but the plan was changed following pressure from the CPMs allies and a section of the party leadership. Reliance later decided to buy land on its own. 

 However, the company has not yet been given the licence for procuring agriculture products from farmers.

 The chief minister told Forward Bloc leaders that legally and constitutionally, Indian companies cant be denied the licence, particularly when the government has already allowed other domestic companies to open shop.

 If we dont issue the licence to Reliance, the company may now go to court. And if the court compels us to grant the licence, it will only go against the governments image, a CPM source said.

 Asked whether the company planned to go to court, a Reliance official declined to comment but added that no threat has been made to the government.

 Bhattacharjee told the Bloc leaders and the minister to devise some clauses to protect farmers interests as well.

 He urged them to settle the licence row by sitting with Reliance officials. But the Bloc leaders were non-committal and told Bhattacharjee that they would decide after discussing the issue at their party forum. 

 A Bloc leader said the party is worried by the sweep of the Reliance plan. 

 The Reliance project cannot be considered on a par with other retail projects. They are limited to the city and its surrounding areas, whereas the Reliance project will penetrate every corner of the state, the Bloc leader said.

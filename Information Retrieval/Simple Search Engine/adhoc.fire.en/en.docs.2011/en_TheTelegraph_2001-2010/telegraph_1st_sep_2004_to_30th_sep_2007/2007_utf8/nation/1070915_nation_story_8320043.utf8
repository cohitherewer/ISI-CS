 Left lines up N-list

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The Left has called to question almost the entire nuclear policy of the Centre, using the 123 deal to quiz the government not only on its closeness to the Bush regime but also on policies that have constricted the supply of fuel to reactors.

 In a note to be given to the government, the Left has listed eight points on which it disagrees with the Centres policies. 

 The Centre is likely to respond to the Lefts questions before a meeting of the UPA-Left panel on the 123 deal. 

 In addition to its campaign against the Hyde Act, to which it believes the 123 deal is obliged, the Left has also asked why enough uranium was not being mined in the country when there are proven deposits.

 Topping the Lefts concern is the hurry of the Manmohan Singh and Bush governments to close the deal without amending the Hyde Act. It urges the Centre to persuade the US government to amend the Hyde Act.

 The note is believed to have understood to have been drafted by A. Gopalakrishnan, former chairman of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, and vetted by the leadership of all the constituents of the Left.

 It will be submitted to the Centre ahead of the September 19 meeting of the panel on the 123 deal.

 The Left suspects that there were administrative decisions to not support uranium mining in the country. This caused the shortage. 

 This concern has also been voiced by other scien-tists in the nuclear energy establishment who are dissenting. 

 The shortage of uranium has slowed down Indias nuclear programme over two decades because of a financial squeeze brought about by the Centre, the Left suspects.

 The Left has asked why the 123 deal does not mention a plan to separate military and civilian nuclear facilities that was prepared and announced in March 2006, a year and three months before the 123 deal was initialled. 

 Has the US government accepted the separation plan as a mutually agreed document? What are the implications of its omission?, the note asks.

 Srinagar, April 27: Violence swept through Srinagar today over reports that a 200-year-old mosque, out of bounds for the past 17 years, had crumbled. 

 The mosque is inside the Hari Parbat fort, which houses a camp of security forces. Last week, the fort was thrown open to visitors 17 years after the forces took possession of it. 

 Protests rocked Srinagars old city, with people alleging that the mosque was desecrated by the forces, a charge denied by the government. 

 The fort has been closed following the controversy. 

 The protesters fought pitched battles with police. People burnt tyres, blocked traffic and threw stones at the police who resorted to lathicharge and fired tear gas shells to disperse the mob. 

 A shutdown was observed in parts of the old city. Lawyers went on strike, paralysing courts.

 The reports that the mosque was desecrated are false. There were some stone-pelting incidents today but the situation is under control, DIG Srinagar, Budgam range, Farooq Ahmad said. 

 Khursheed Ahmad Qadri, director of the state archaeology department, said the mosque had been damaged by the 2005 earthquake and weather. 

 Along with the fort, it remained unattended during all these years as we were not allowed to visit it. Both the mosque and the fort are now in ruins, he said. 

 Qadri, however, said a major renovation project is under way to restore the glory of the complex. 

 The Valleys separatists have pledged to reconstruct the mosque.

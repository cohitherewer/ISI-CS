The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Rate 35 lakh, with discount

 - Andhra trafficking racket back in glare

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, April 22: Andhra Pradesh police may have put 150 VIPs under the scanner after the Babubhai Katara arrest, but the illegal immigration racket was thriving under its nose for years.

 With so many going abroad from the state, its easy to slip in illegal immigrants, said a travel agent, claiming he had closely watched the rackets operation in Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam.

 Andhra sends a large number of immigrants to the US and Britain every year mostly doctors and IT professionals as well as to the Gulf and the European continent. Many become green-card holders and want their aged relatives to join them even if they have to bend the law for it.

 The current rate is around Rs 35 lakh a person. But there is an age discount. For instance, it may be Rs 25 lakh for a 55-year-old, said a man who brokers deals between the travel agents and the VIPs.

 Andhra burst into the official picture of the probe yesterday after many of the suspect travel agents turned out to be from the state. Also, it was alleged, a state-based politicians secretary was a key player.

 State passport officials said they were probing some 25 MLAs, a dozen IAS and IPS officers, four MPs and 10 business executives who had recently gone abroad with their spouses and associates.

 We are now investigating whether those who accompanied the VVIPS abroad have all returned, an official said at the regional passport office.

 Rajinder Kumar Gampa, Kataras secretary and a key accused, has been brought to Hyderabad to assist the probe.

 The racket is powered by emigrants keenness to have their sisters, parents and aged relatives join them.

 But these countries dont issue visas easily to dependants; they only want a work force, passport official Bala Baskar said.

 The VIPs ensure the clients travel on false passports with visas issued under false names. So, its easy for them to overstay and not get caught.

 Mostly, its the wealthy coastal communities with members settled in the US as doctors or techies who take this route, an officer said.

 Nation-wide, the demand is highest from the business communities in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra who have members living in the US, Britain, Norway, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

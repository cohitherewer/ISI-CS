 Elite corps in molest row

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, July 10: A railway police deputy inspector-general has been accused of molesting the wife of an IPS officer in front of her sister, an IAS officer.

 The backgrounds of the accused, accuser and witness had been enough to keep Patna buzzing before the railway minister fanned the row with an off-hand clean chit to the police officer.

 P.J. Rawal, a Railway Protection Force DIG posted in Delhi, was travelling to Patna on the Sampoorn Kranti Express on Sunday. The victim and her sister, a Bihar home department official, were his co-passengers in the AC-I cabin.

 They made polite conversation for a while and around 10.30pm, the women finished their dinner and retired for the night.

 Around midnight, Rawal allegedly returned to the cabin drunk and pretended to stumble, falling over the victim who was sleeping on a lower berth.

 There was a scene, ending with the sisters slapping the man and snatching his cellphone and identity card.

 When other passengers and coach attendants confronted the policeman, he apologised. The sisters returned the cellphone but kept his identity card, and the chastened DIG shifted to an AC-II coach.

 The victim, a resident of Shivpuri, Patna, made an entry into the railways complaint book at the end of the journey yesterday. A case was registered with Patna railway police today following a discussion the victims sister had with state home secretary Afzal Amanullah yesterday.

 Patna railway station head Alok Kumar Singh said: As the incident took place near Mughalsarai, we have registered a zero FIR and will forward it to Mughalsarai railway police.

 Lalu Prasad, however, told reporters: RPF director-general M.K. Sinha has already looked into the matter but did not find anything serious.

 He chastised the media for sensationalising the incident but said a probe would be conducted after a formal complaint is lodged.

 An embarrassed Rawal took refuge in a VIP room at Patna Junction yesterday, opening the door a crack to tell reporters: I have nothing to say.

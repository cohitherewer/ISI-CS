 EC mum on Sonia roots

 New Delhi, Aug. 5 (PTI): The Election Commission has refrained from making any comment on Sonia Gandhis foreign origin before the Supreme Court, which has decided to examine whether a person not born in the country is entitled to hold public office under the Constitution.

 The court had sought a specific reply whether a person who had acquired citizenship by registration can be appointed to public office.

 The EC has no comment to make on this constitutional question as it does not pertain to the conduct of elections, the poll panel said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Do-not-call disconnect

 JAYATI GHOSE

 Pesky puzzle

 New Delhi, Sept. 4: The day to shut out nagging telemarketers has dawned. A national do-not-call registry is in place and people are eager to sign up. But few have a clue how to go about it.

 A day before registrations for the do-not-call service are due to kick off, most telecom operators do not seem to have bothered to intimate subscribers on how to enlist.

 Most operators have not made public the process for NDNC registry. The nation-wide advertising campaign to educate subscribers is nowhere to be seen, leaving customers clueless, a telecom official said.

 Any mobile user can get his/her number included in the NDNC list by intimating the mobile service provider through SMS, via a call centre, on the service providers website or even by sending a letter. They can also register at www.ndncregistry.com.

 A telecom major that has kept subscribers interests in mind is BSNL. It is running advertisement campaigns to educate customers on how to register via customer care, SMS or by sending a letter to BSNL.

 The sad story is none of the other telecom majors has done anything yet, an official said.

 The websites of major operators like Airtel, Hutch, Reliance and Idea also provide links for registration. But few people know this because it has not been made public.

 A common campaign to educate customers is being prepared by the Cellular Operators Association of India. It will be ready by next week, said Rajat Mukarji, chief corporate affairs officer, Idea Cellular.

 Many have been calling customer care to enquire and request for registration with NDNC. We are ready to assist the customers.

 According to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India regulations, a customer wishing to sign up for the service has to be given a service registration number via SMS within a few hours.

 He/she will have to be registered within 45 days. The registration will be valid for 10 years.

 Telemarketers will be fined Rs 500 for every call or SMS made to an NDNC customer. For calling the same number a second time, a fine of Rs 1,000 will be levied. The third time, the telemarketer will lose his phone connection.

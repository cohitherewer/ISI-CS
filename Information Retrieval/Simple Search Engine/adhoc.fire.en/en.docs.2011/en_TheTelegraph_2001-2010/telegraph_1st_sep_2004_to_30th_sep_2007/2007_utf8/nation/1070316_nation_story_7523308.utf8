 Nandigram, March 15: When the bodies were falling near the Bhangabera bridge yesterday, the leaders of the Nandigram resistance were nowhere in sight.

 Today those same bodies, lying cold in the morgues, brought the leaders back into the picture.

 Office-bearers of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee announced they would march into the villages with the dead from early tomorrow morning and let the administration stop them if it could.

 The leaders said scores of villagers who had fled Sonachura and adjoining villages would join the march.

 Committee convener Abu Taher of the Trinamul Congress denied that the land movements spearheads had gone into hiding. He said they were very much alert and doing their duty.

 I, along with some leaders, had started off for Sonachura after learning of the massive police advance. Halfway through the journey, we saw people rushing the injured to hospital. So we, too, became busy ensuring that the injured received proper treatment at hospital, said Taher, who was heading to Sonachura from Nandigram proper.

 Another committee convener, local Congress leader Sabuj Pradhan, had his mobile switched off for most of Wednesday. He said he was very much in Sonachura, providing leadership to the villagers.

 We have asked our supporters in Garchakraberia, Kendamari and Bhekutia to be prepared for organised resistance (that can start) any moment, he declared.

 We have asked about 400 villagers who fled Sonachura and neighbouring areas after the firing to accompany us when we bring back the bodies.

 He said there would be thousands marching with the bodies to Sonachura, Gangra and Jalpai. We want the dead cremated at their birthplace. They deserve that much respect.

 Taher and Pradhan warned of another flare-up if the administration stopped them.

 We want the last rites performed in their respective villages. If the administration doesnt allow it, we dont know what will happen, Taher said.

 The committee leaders said 18 villages that the police hadnt yet re-entered were ready to resist them. Roads were being dug up afresh at many places.

 We have told our supporters to dig up as many roads and create as much obstruction as they can to hold the police off. Roads have been dug up at Amgachhia and Bhekutia, Pradhan said.

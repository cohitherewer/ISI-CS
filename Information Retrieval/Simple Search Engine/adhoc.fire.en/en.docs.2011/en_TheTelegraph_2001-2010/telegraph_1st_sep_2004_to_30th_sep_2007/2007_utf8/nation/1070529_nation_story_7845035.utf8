 SC notice on accident details

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 28: The Supreme Court today issued notices to state governments on a petition alleging viola-tion of a law that makes it mandatory for police to report details of motor accidents to tribunals and insurance companies.

 Some insurance companies had submitted that proper compliance of Section 158(6) of the Motor Vehicle Act would help expeditious settlement of genuine claims and avoid cases before motor accident claims tribunals.

 Genuine claimants would not have to move the tribunals for compensation, the petitioners added.

 The companies said 1.5 million such cases were pending before the tribunals.

 Posting the matter for hearing on June 18, a bench headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat asked the state governments to submit the number of cases that are pending and those in which the police had provided details to tribunals and insurance companies.

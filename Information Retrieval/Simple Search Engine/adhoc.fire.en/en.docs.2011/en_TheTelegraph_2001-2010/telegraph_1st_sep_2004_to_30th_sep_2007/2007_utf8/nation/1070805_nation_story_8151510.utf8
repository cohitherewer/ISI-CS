 Scam shakes Sheila govt

 Dikshit

 New Delhi, Aug. 4: Loyalists of chief minister Sheila Dikshit and her enemies traded allegations today as a Rs 100-crore land scam rocked the capitals Congress government and brought internal rivalries out into the open.

 The accusations have come in the wake of a CBI raid on the house of Ashok Malhotra, an absconding contractor considered close to many Delhi politicians.

 The CBI says Malhotra used his political links to run a canteen in the Delhi government secretariat and in the office of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and was handed over plots meant for slums at throwaway prices.

 Several documents were seized during the raid. The sleuths also discovered a fleet of 52 expensive cars with VIP number plates.

 Dikshits supporters claim that the responsibility for the scam lies with minister of state for urban development Ajay Maken as the DDA is under his jurisdiction and transport minister Haroon Yusuf.

 The chief ministers detractors allege that Dikshit herself sanctioned the VIP number plates.

 Loyalists of Dikshit, whose second term as chief minister ends in April, have openly accused the other camp of trying to destabilise the government.

 They say Maken, Yusuf and others like A.K. Walia, Arvinder Singh Lovely and former Union minister Jagdish Tytler are behind the plot.

 It is hidden from no one that these people want her out of the chief ministers seat. Maken, in particular, wants to be chief minister, a source close to Dikshit said.

 The accused leaders, on their part, met Ashok Gehlot, the man in charge of Congress affairs in Delhi, and complained that Dikshit was planting allegations against them in the media.

 Malhotra, the absconding contractor, is alleged to have bought 5,500 plots around 8sqm each at Rs 3,000 a square metre when market rates were more than 20 times higher.

 The CBI has arrested five DDA officials. The urban development ministry is conducting an internal probe.

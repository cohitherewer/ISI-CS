 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Packed off for a beggars life

 Desperate to meet targets on ridding Mumbais streets of mendicants, police locked up for 42 days somebody whos not a beggar.

 In a curious case of mistaken identities and a mad scramble to prove the police are up to their job, Zakir Khan was packed off to a childrens home and, despite requesting the police to call up his home, hasnt been let off yet.

 The 15-year-old was near his home on Grant Road on February 28 when he was herded into a police van. The police officials paid no heed to his pleas that he wasnt one of those theyd been looking for. Their desperation could have been more because it was the last day of the month.

 The officers refused to listen when Zakir said he wasnt a beggar. He even asked them to call home and check the facts, said Abul Kalam, Zakirs grandfather. Abul said it was impossible for anyone to mistake his grandson for a beggar. 

 Zakirs father, Mehboob, a watchmaker, is still cursing the time his sons ordeal began.

 Shadow on cave temple

 A cave temple under the Archaeological Survey of Indias (ASI) control is at the centre of an unholy row ever since it was revealed that it has been illegally converted into a place of worship.

 The matter reached the Madurai bench of Madras High Court, which asked the central government-run department to check if the temple in Tirumalpuram Malai was, indeed, being used for worship. 

 It also said action should be taken against officials who allowed the breach of law.

 The temple, dedicated to Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, is only a tourist attraction. But an illegal committee, called Karthigai, had been formed and was collecting money from devotees visiting the spot, the petitioner alleged. 

 He also said the ASI had not taken any action against the offenders despite repeated complaints.

 School joins bulge battle

 The flab fight is entering new battlegrounds, going from drawing rooms to classrooms. 

 In the capital, one school is leading the charge by considering whether chips and ice-cream should be classified avoidable for students.

 There is high probability that the advisory may reach schools run by the Delhi Public School (DPS) Society if the programme launched at DPS International is found palatable.

 In collaboration with diabetes foundations, DPS International has introduced a healthy living and life skills programme as part of an effort to tackle childhood obesity.

 Children and teachers received lessons in healthy eating and the importance of regular exercise. 

 Actually, the capital is a good place to start. A recent survey has indicated that the percentage of overweight or obese children of school-going age in Delhi has increased sharply from 18 in 2004 to 28 in 2006.

 Sleep tight

 Bleary-eyed IT high-fliers in Cyberabad neednt lose sleep over their daily grind. 

 All they need to do is check out a hospital promising snooze remedies.

 Apollo Hospitals has set up a department to treat sleep disorders in collaboration with a US healthcare firm.

 Although sleep labs are available in and around the city, this will be the first that will be integrated with various departments like ENT, neurology and sub-specialities such as psychology and cardiology, Apollo group chairman Pratap C. Reddy said.

 The lab will treat patients suffering from insomnia, sleep apnoea and other such disorders.

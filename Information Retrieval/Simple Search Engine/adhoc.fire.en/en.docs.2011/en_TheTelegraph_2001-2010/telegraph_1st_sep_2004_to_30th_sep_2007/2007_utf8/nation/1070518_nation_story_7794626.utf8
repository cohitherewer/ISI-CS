 Big Two speak Mayas language

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 17: What Mayavati said yesterday, Delhi is saying today.

 Both Manmohan Singh and L.K. Advani have dropped positive hints on her post-comeback pet theme: quota for the poor among the upper castes.

 Sharing a platform with the Prime Minister, the BJP leader set the ball rolling at a conference on the empowerment of Dalits and minorities: I welcome the comments of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati that the poor among the forward castes and communities deserved the benefit of affirmative action. You (the Prime Minister) must take note of it.

 Singh did not disappoint the veteran from the other end of the political spectrum. 

 If there are ideas about the problems faced by poor children from other sections of the community, they should also be taken on board, the Prime Minister told reporters later.

 The statements seemed more an attempt to humour Mayavati, the flavour of the season after her dramatic victory in Uttar Pradesh, than launch an immediate initiative to better the lot of the poor among the upper castes.

 The Congress, despite the Samajwadi Party promising it votes in the presidential poll, is keen on Mayavatis support. Her votes will not be cast out of love or charity, said a source.

 Mayavatis rainbow coalition of Brahmins, Dalits and Muslims had hurt the Congress as well as the BJP. This was the axis that kept the Congress in power in Lucknow before it unravelled later.

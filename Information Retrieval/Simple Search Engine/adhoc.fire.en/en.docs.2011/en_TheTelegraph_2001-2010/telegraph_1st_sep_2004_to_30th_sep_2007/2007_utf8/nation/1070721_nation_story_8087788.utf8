 Content code for TV

 New Delhi, July 20 (PTI): The government today released a content code, including self-regulation guidelines for the broadcasting sector, that spells out dos and donts for news channels while carrying out sting operations to avoid privacy infringement.

 Channels must not use material relating to a persons personal or private affairs or which invades an individuals privacy unless there is an identifiable larger public interest or reason for the material to be broadcast, the 34-page document said.

 Under the content certification rules, identifiable larger public interest includes revealing or detecting crime or disreputable behaviour. It also includes protecting public health or safety, exposing misleading claims made by individuals or organisations or disclosing significant incompetence in public office.

 The code said channels should ensure senior editorial control while selecting material in matters relating to privacy and intrusion into public affairs. The guidelines also suggested the appointment of one or more content auditors as part of the channels internal regulatory mechanism.

 The code has categorised programmes in three segments U and S, U/A and A.

 Programmes in the first category can be viewed at all times and by all age groups, while the second can be viewed by adults or minors above 12 years under parental guidance between 8pm and 4am. Category A is restricted to viewing by those above 18.

 The I amp;B ministry unveiled the code after a meeting with broadcasters today, ahead of plans to bring a broadcast bill in the August monsoon session.

 The code said the self-regulation mechanism comes at two levels broadcast service providers and the industry and added it would be the responsibility of each provider to comply with the rules under the Cable TV Network Act.

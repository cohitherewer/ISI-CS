 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Host faces music for silly poser

 Anchor Sajid Haroon wont forget Poonam Dhillon anytime soon.

 While hosting the Dream Girl 2007 contest in Mumbais Andheri recently, Sajid was made to do sit-ups on stage by Dhillon, the events chief guest. His fault: asking contestants silly questions. 

 One of the posers went like this: How will you make a blind person feel the red colour? This angered the actress so much that she ordered him to do sit-ups right away.

 The question left the 14 contestants, and an audience of about 500, flummoxed: I was upset, as there is little one can do to answer such questions, Dhillon said, adding that the answer Sajid suggested was as silly as his riddle.

 But one of televisions most visible hosts took the sit-ups in his stride. She told me not to pose such tough questions to the contestants and I agreed. I apologised over and over again and I went through the punishment, said Sajid, who has held fort at more than 200 shows.

 From mind to market

 Indias technology entrepreneurs may be brimming with ideas, but are often poorly armed with the skills to turn them into smart products.

 But a unique initiative launched in Delhi last week may help them overcome that hurdle. Ficci has joined a triangular partnership with Lockheed Martin Corporation and the IC2 Institute at the University of Texas to bring Indian technology to new markets, quickly. In the first phase, 64 entrepreneurs picked up lessons in commercialising ideas. After screening, the 12 most promising ideas will be turned into marketable products. This is a mind-to-market programme for entrepreneurs, said Amit Mitra, the chambers secretary-general. 

 The exercise covers engineering, infotech, telecom, life sciences and biotechnology. 

 YSR makes a point

 Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy is a man in a hurry, especially if hes proving a point. In April, the Andhra chief minister asked bureaucrats to organise a swearing-in for new ministers within 12 hours.

 The rush was prompted, apparently, by the need to rubbish reports in a popular Telugu daily that had been insisting there would be no expansion.

 The daily hadnt read the cues right. The Andhra chief minister hadnt only made up its mind, but also consulted Congress leaders in Delhi on what was to be his third enlargement.

 Not allowing the reports to fuel discontent among cabinet hopefuls, the chief minister sent directions for organising the swearing-in from Chittoor, 800 km from Hyderabad. 

 The applause, after the rapid-fire expansion, was equally quick. Reddy is a better media manager than Chandrababu Naidu, said a columnist.

 Tongue twined

 Both are from Tamil Nadu and both speak Hindi good enough to draw election crowds.

 But one of Chennais biggest talking points in recent weeks has been who knows the language better.

 While Hema Malinis flair isnt a secret, it was Jayalalithaas flourish that impressed many in Allahabad, where the ADMK chief sought votes for Mulayam Singh Yadav.

 Amma smashed the linguistic barrier with such ease that many here were reminded about the days when MGRs appeal went beyond Tamil Nadu. 

 But unlike Hema, who made her mark in Delhi durbar in little time, Amma might have to wait for her big chance till the elusive third front takes shape.

 Chennai: Al roads in Tamil Nadu will lead to Ooty in the week ahead. The hill resort is hosting the Nilgiris Summer Festival, which promises to be a treat for nature lovers. So, get set to soak in the fragrance of roses and the flavours of fruits. The festival will be on till May 21.

 New Delhi, May 25: Adidas has approached the monopoly watchdog to stop rival Nike and the cricket board from using Sachin Tendulkars images when he is not playing for the country.

 The company today moved the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission, saying Nike had no right to use the batsman in promos when he is off the field. Adidas has an exclusive deal with Sachin.

 The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has a five-year contract with Nike for team uniform. The US sports equipment maker had won the sponsorship rights to the Indian team in 2005 with a bid of Rs 199.66 crore, beating Reeboks bid of Rs 119.48 crore and Adidass offer of Rs 127.50 crore.

 .P. Dwivedi, who heads the watchdog, admitted Adidass petition and sent notices to Nike India, the BCCI, Sachin and Iconix, the firm that manages the cricketers business interests. They have three weeks to send their replies. Sachin has been asked to furnish an undertaking to the commission that he personally endorsed Adidas. 

 The company, in turn, has been asked to file a rejoinder within two weeks of receiving the replies. 

 The row comes weeks after the comptroller and auditor general said Sachin had been given unfair tax waivers to the tune of Rs 3.7 crore on income from endorsements.

 Sachin has been our brand ambassador since 1997. This is the public perception. Nikes claim that his brand name was with them amounts to an unfair trade practice, Adidass lawyer Shailendra K. Kapoor said. 

 He stressed that the contract between the board and Nike did not cover personal endorsements.

 However, Adidas did not get any immediate relief. When you have waited for six months, then wait for one more, Dwivedi said. The next hearing will be in July.

 Kapoor said Adidas had sent Nike evidence of its exclusive endorsement rights with the cricketer, including a letter from Sachin. He also produced a Nike T-shirt before the commission bearing Sachins name and number.

 In the letter, Sachin has confirmed that he has an exclusive deal with Adidas and that Nike had no right to use his name in an individual capacity. The cricketer has also said Adidass loss would also be his personal loss.

 Adidas, however, said it has not assessed the quantum of financial damages caused by Nikes actions so far. Nike and Adidas officials werent available for comment.

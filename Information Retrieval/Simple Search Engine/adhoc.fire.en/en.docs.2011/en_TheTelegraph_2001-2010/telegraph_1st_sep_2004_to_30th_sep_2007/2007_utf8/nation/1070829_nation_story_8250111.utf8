 Bomb planters identified

 New Delhi, Aug. 28 (PTI): Security agencies have identified at least two men who are suspected to have planted the bombs that went off in Hyderabad, sources said.

 Raids are being carried out in various parts of Hyderabad to track down the duo, the sources claimed late tonight.

 The two could have planted the bombs that were believed to have been assembled by Mohammad Sharifuddin, a Bangladeshi national, the sources added.

 While Andhra Pradesh police were tight-lipped, the sources in Delhi said the role of the Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami (Huji) was almost certain after Sharifuddins name cropped up during investigations.

 Sharifuddin had extended support to Huji and other militant groups purely for monetary gains, the sources claimed.

 Sharifuddin is believed to have undertaken the task according to the orders of Huji commander Abdul Sahil Mohammed.

 Throughout July and early August, Sharifuddin left dozens of Internet messages for his Hyderabad operatives, asking them to go ahead with plans.

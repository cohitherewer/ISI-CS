 Cut-off, IITs 

 and parents

 - CALCULATION METHOD SAME, RESULT DIFFERENT 

 How 

 the IITs said they calculated the cut-off marks for JEE 

 2006:

 Over 2 lakh general category students 

 appeared in the three papers: physics, chemistry and math 

 The average of the marks scored 

 by all these students was calculated separately for physics 

 (P), chemistry(C) and math (M) 

 The standard deviation a statistical 

 quantity that measures the spread of marks on 

 either side of the average was computed separately for 

 physics (SDP), chemistry (SDC) and math (SDM) 

 The cut-offs for the three subjects 

 were determined in this way physics: P minus SDP; chemistry: 

 C minus SDC; math: M minus SDM (that is, the average minus 

 the standard deviation, individually for each subject) * 

 The IIT cut-off marks in 2006 

 (obtained under RTI Act): 

 Physics: 48, chemistry: 55, math: 

 37. A further aggregate cut-off was set: 154

 What aggrieved parents did: 

 Obtained marks in all three 

 subjects of all students who had cleared the cut-off in 

 physics (even if they might not have made the cut-offs in 

 the other two subjects) 

 Obtained similar lists for students 

 who had cleared the chemistry cut-off (but may or may not 

 have cleared the other two cut-offs) and math cut-off (but 

 may or may not have cleared the other two cut-offs) 

 Merged the three lists, and removed 

 duplication (of students who cleared more than one cut-off) 

 to come up with a consolidated list of over 32,000 candidates. 

 These candidates automatically included all those selected 

 that is, those who cleared the aggregate cut-off and 

 also all those who cleared one or more subject cut-offs 

 but not the aggregate cut-off 

 Calculated the average and standard 

 deviation for each subject from this consolidated list of 

 toppers 

 Then came the shock: The cut-off 

 marks, calculated by the method disclosed by the IITs from 

 the list of toppers, were: physics: 22, chemistry: 26, math: 

 24 

 And the IITs official cut-offs 

 should have been even lower. Because their database included 

 the non-toppers as well

 The significance:

 Apart from the around 6,000 students 

 called for counselling, several hundred of the other toppers 

 who had made the IITs aggregate cut-off but missed 

 one or two of the subject cut-offs would have made all the 

 subject cut-offs calculated by the parents 

 * The same process was used to calculate the cut-offs for SC/ST candidates

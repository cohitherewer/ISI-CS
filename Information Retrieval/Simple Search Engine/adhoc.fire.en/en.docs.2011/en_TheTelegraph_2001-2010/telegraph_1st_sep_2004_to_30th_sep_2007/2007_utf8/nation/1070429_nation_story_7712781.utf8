 Modis dilemma: To sack or to shift

 Ahmedabad, April 28: After the arrest of blue-eyed cop D.G. Vanzara, Narendra Modi now has to find a way to keep trusted home minister Amit Shah out of jail as he faces the biggest crisis of his second term.

 Former BJP minister and top lawyer Arun Jaitley arrived in Ahmedabad today and went into a huddle with the chief minister and state party president Purushottam Rupala. 

 Afraid that Shah might be arrested in the fake encounter case that has put Vanzara and two other IPS officers behind bars not a happy thought in an election year a section of the BJP is calling for his removal. This would take the sting out of the Oppositions attack. But Rupala denies any move is afoot to drop Shah. 

 Sohrabuddin Sheikh was pulled out of a Hyderabad-Mumbai bus in November 2005 and shot dead by Vanzara and his colleagues, who passed off the killing as an encounter with a Lashkar-e-Toiba militant on a mission to assassinate Modi. His wife Kauser Bano, travelling with Sohrabuddin, had been missing since. Yesterday the government told the court she, too, could have been murdered by its police.

 The CID team probing the case is now headed to Vanzaras village Illol in Sabarakantha. Sohrabuddins brother Rubabuddin says his sister-in-law is buried in the house of the police officer, who holds the rank of deputy inspector-general. A petition that Rubabuddin filed in the Supreme Court challenging the encounter paved the way for the CID inquiry.

 Social activist Raeeskhan Pathan said villagers told him they saw a Muslim woman in Vanzaras house after the encounter and also heard screams. A well near the house that was giving off a foul smell was later covered and a room built on it. 

 Journalists who had gone to Illol today were attacked by Vanzaras supporters who pelted them with stones and drove them out. The officers younger brother, K.G. Vanzara, a deputy secretary, has been camping in the village for the past few days. 

 The vehicle allegedly used by the policemen to bring Sohrabuddin and Kauser to Ahmedabad after pulling them off the bus was seized today and brought to the state police chiefs office in Gandhinagar. The Qualis belongs to a leading fish exporter from Porbander who is a friend of Rajkumar Pandiyan, one of the two other officers arrested with Vanzara, sources said. 

 The three policemen had claimed at the time that Sohrabuddin was riding a motorcycle it turned out to be a stolen two-wheeler that had been lying in a police station, the sources added, citing the CID reports submitted in the Supreme Court.

 Non-government organisations, the Opposition Congress and even some BJP dissidents are demanding a CBI inquiry not only into the fake encounter but all the 15-odd encounters during Modis term. If one is ordered, a senior BJP leader said, the chief minister will have no option but to sacrifice Shah since the perception is that Vanzara and the others could not have acted without the go-ahead from their political masters. 

 But Shah is one of Modis two most trusted ministers Anandiben Patel, who holds the education portfolio, is the other and the chief minister is reluctant to drop him. Instead, he might change his portfolio. Once Shah is out of the home ministry, to whom the CID reports, the chief minister hopes the clamour for his scalp will die down.

 Since the arrest of Vanzara and the others by the CID on Tuesday, Shah and Modi have been meeting almost every day. 

 Police sources said DGP P.C. Pande today instructed the CID to inform additional DGP .P. Mathur before arresting any officer.

 BJP leaders admit Modis image has been dented but are counting on his ability to wriggle out of a tight spot the chief minister bounced back to power after the 2002 riots. If Presidents rule were to be imposed, they hope he would be able to turn the situation into a political advantage. 

 But BJP spokesman Yamal Vyas admitted that it was unlikely the Congress would take such a step that was sure to backfire.

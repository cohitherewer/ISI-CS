 Move over temple, hail S amp; S

 SANJAY K. JHA AND RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Sept. 23: The Ram setu appears to have scored over the Ram temple as the BJPs pet poll plank.

 Senior leader L.K. Advani today indicated that two Ss setu and Sachar would set up the BJPs campaign theme for the snap polls imminent in the first half of 2008.

 In his concluding remarks at the BJP national executive, he said the setu controversy and the Sachar committee report on the status of Muslims had given a new edge to the partys old planks of Hindu pride and minorityism.

 Lashing out at the UPA for deriding the Hindu faith in its affidavit on Adams Bridge, he said a government that denied Rams existence had no right to exist. He was most severe on Sonia Gandhi, the Left and the DMK, calling them the three destabilisers of the government.

 A government that has betrayed the aam aadmi, a government that has failed on the internal security front, that has no concern for national unity, that is determined to undo Indias nuclear capability and a government whose ministers are neck deep in corruption has no right to continue in office, he said.

 Advani claimed that one of the reasons for the UPAs failure was its obsession with minority votes. The UPAs politics of minorityism has become a major hurdle in Indias fight against terror. I charge the government with communalising Indias campaign against terrorism.

 On the Indo-US deal, he said the BJP wanted India to catch the nuclear bus without getting off the nuclear weapons bus. He urged party workers to counter propaganda that his party was blocking the path of Indias nuclear empowerment.

 Bhopal, Sept. 21: The BJP today stepped up its opposition to the Sethusamudram ship canal project, deciding to move a separate resolution at its national executive meet.

 Possibly sensing that mid-term polls were inevitable, the party also decided to woo a new southern ally in Jayalalithaa.

 The Ram setu resolution is likely to be moved by Murli Manohar Joshi, who has the backing of the RSS. Joshi has been in a bit of political hibernation but is often seen as a counter to L.K. Advani.

 The BJP, which earlier said it would boost the campaign of the VHP and allied organisations against the canal, decided to go on its own after sensing the mood of party delegates. BJP national president Rajnath Singh might have prevailed on the Sangh to let the BJP have its own campaign.

 A somewhat charged BJP asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to dismiss DMK ministers in the Union cabinet if Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi did not withdraw his blasphemous remarks on Ram.

 It also asked the Congress to spell out what Jawaharlal Nehru had said about Ram.

 In his presidential address, Rajnath used strong words against Karunanidhi, a former ally of the BJP.

 From Aurangzeb to Angrez (the British), no foreign ruler dared to question Rams existence. The DMK is part of the UPA-led coalition and it is the duty of the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi to persuade Karunanidhi to withdraw the derogatory, offensive and blasphemous remarks.

 To loud cheers, Rajnath told BJP delegates a new southern ally was set to join the NDA but stopped short of naming Jayalalithaa, who is now part of a defunct third front.

 But BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad named her, pointing at her opposition to Karunanidhi on the setu controversy. He ducked a question on how the BJP had attacked Jayalalithaa following the arrest of the Kanchi sankaracharya.

 When the BJP formed a government at the Centre in 1998, Jayalalithaa had backed the party. But somewhere down the line, she had a famous tea party with Sonia and changed her mind.

 During the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, Jayalalithaa tied up with the Congress. But the alliance suffered a black eye as the BJP swept back to power.

 When Jayalalithaa returned to power in Tamil Nadu in 2001, she began making overtures to the BJP. She supported the BJP-led NDA in the 2004 elections.

 Prasad said if Karunanidhi did not apologise, the BJP would never consider the DMK as its ally.

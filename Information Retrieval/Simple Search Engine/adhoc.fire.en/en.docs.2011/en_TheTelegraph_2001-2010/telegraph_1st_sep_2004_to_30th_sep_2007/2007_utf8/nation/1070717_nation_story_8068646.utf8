 Guide in rape net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Shimla, July 16: A Manali tourist guide accused of raping a South Korean woman last month was arrested from a Punjab village on Saturday. The action came after an intervention by the South Korean embassy in Delhi.

 According to police, Devraj, 35, had offered to help the 28-year-old woman get a bus to Delhi while she was waiting in Manali on June 30. He took her on his bike saying she would get a bus a few kilometres away, but allegedly raped her at a remote spot before dropping her in front of a hotel. Devraj has been on the run since an FIR was lodged.

 The South Korean embassy had taken serious note of the incident. Its officials had visited Manali and asked the local authorities to track down the culprit quickly. Devraj was arrested from Punjabs Lalita Kalan village in Ludhiana on Saturday night, said G.D. Bhargava, the Kullu superintendent of police.

 TN minority quota pledge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Karunanidhi

 Chennai, May 27: Tamil Nadu will within a week introduce education and job quotas for the minorities if there are no legal hurdles, the chief minister said tonight.

 M. Karunanidhi told a conference on Tamil literature and Islam that his government, after consulting legal experts, would promulgate an ordinance earmarking for the minorities a portion of the Backward Classes quota.

 Compartmentalising the reservation by making it a sub-quota within an already implemented quota could be legally less troublesome, the chief minister said.

 The Supreme Court has capped the overall volume of reservation at the Centre and states at 50 per cent, and a challenge to Tamil Nadus 69 per cent reservation in education and jobs is pending before it.

 Also, the 5 per cent Muslim quota in education and jobs that Andhra Pradesh had introduced three years ago is still stalled because of a court case. Among other arguments against it, one was that it had racheted up the overall quota volume over 50 per cent.

 On the other hand, Karunanidhi said, Karnataka and Kerala had successfully put into effect minority quotas as sub-quotas.

 Karunanidhi had told the Assembly on April 5 that his government had decided to accept the Tamil Nadu Backward Classes Commissions recommendation to introduce reservation for Christians and Muslims. He had then said he would wait till the court case over the 69 per cent quantum was settled.

 Since then, Muslim leaders have been arguing for compartmental reservation out of the 30 per cent Backward Classes quota, citing the minorities educational and social backwardness.

 The state doesnt have an Other Backward Classes quota; instead, it has Backward Classes and Most Backward Classes quotas other than the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes quotas.

 The Backward Classes quota already includes a few Muslim groups such as the Labbai Muslims.

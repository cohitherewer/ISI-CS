 Dad in jail, kids beg for vote

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Punit and Shovam urge people to vote for their father. Telegraph picture

 Varanasi, April 23: Dadi, the two little boys call out. They show the elderly woman a photograph of their father.

 Hamare papa ko unke dushman marwana chahte hain. Aapka ek vote unki zindagi bacha sakta hai, dadi (Our papas enemies want to get him killed. Your vote can save his life, grandma), nine-year-old Punit begs with folded hands. 

 His brother Shovam, a shy seven-year-old, can only plead silently with his eyes.

 To an outsider, the scene at Tonderpur village could be the most poignant of these Uttar Pradesh elections.

 But to many residents, its a cynical ploy by a jailed gangster to use his children to engineer a sympathy wave in his constituency of Gangapur, 23 km from Varanasi.

 Sujit Singh Belwa, 42, has been fielded by the Bharatiya Samaj Party, a local outfit that claims to speak for the backward Bhar and Rajbhar castes. But Satyadeo Rajbhar of Tonderpur was sceptical.

 The villagers havent forgotten Belwas reign of terror. He faces trial in more than 10 cases of murder and abduction, he said.

 He now wants political clout. We wont vote for him.

 Yet the sight of two children on the road under a scalding sun, trying to help an imprisoned father, is the stuff of Bhojpuri tearjerkers that run to full houses in this rural belt. Belwas opponents from the Apna Dal and Samajwadi Party are worried.

 The childrens innocent faces have touched a chord in many people, said Aman Patel, an Apna Dal supporter. The way they have been thrown into the bad world of state politics is criminal.

 Every morning, the boys leave home with their mother Neelum, 32, in a jeep provided by the party. Dressed smartly in new shorts and half-sleeve shirts, they approach the voters at their homes.

 Sometimes, they address small groups drawn by curiosity. Punit, slimmer, taller and more articulate, does most of the talking.

 He holds up a photograph of his father. If our father wins, well ensure that all your pending demands are met even before he is released, he says.

 The states additional chief election officer, Devesh Chaturvedi, said he would probe if the code of conduct was being flouted. Well find out whether the children are being used by the party or are doing this because of their own sentiments.

 The boys said their life before the polls was like any other childs: going to school and playing with friends. Punit studies in Class IV at Gangapur Primary School and Shovam in Class II.

 Now, we go to the people and ask them to vote for my father, Punit said. I dont know much about what father used to do except that he was a contractor.

 He added, Mother told us that if the village people vote for my father, he will be freed.

 Belwas party boss, Om Prakash Rajbhar, is delighted with his two star campaigners performance. I dont think the exposure to politics will ruin their future.

 His party colleagues have dubbed the boys sher bachcha (lion kids). But schoolteacher Rambhulan Sharma isnt convinced.

 Chunav ladna aur jitna koi bachchon ka khel nahi (Winning an election is not childs play), he said. The voters will teach the criminal candidate a lesson.

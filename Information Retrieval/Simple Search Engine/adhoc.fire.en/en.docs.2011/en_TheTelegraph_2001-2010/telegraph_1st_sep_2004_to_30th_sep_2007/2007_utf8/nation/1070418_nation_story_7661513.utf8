 One slip of faith good for sack

 New Delhi, April 17 (PTI): A single act of dishonesty and breach of faith by an employee is sufficient to justify termination from service, the Supreme Court has held.

 The fact that the erring employee was not involved in a similar offence does not in any manner mitigate the seriousness of the offence, a bench of Justices B.P. Singh and P.K. Balasubramanyan said, upholding the dismissal order passed by the public sector Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation.

 The bench allowed an appeal filed by the corporation challenging a directive of the Andhra Pradesh High Court that ordered fresh appointment of B. Swamy, a conductor who was dismissed from service for failing to remit fares collected from passengers.

 The high court ordered that Swamy be re-appointed as the punishment was too harsh for the offence. It reasoned that he could not be dismissed for a single offence as the corporation had failed to prove similar offences against him.

 But the apex court rejected the reasoning. If he is dishonest, it said, in the performance of his duties, he is guilty of serious misconduct and the gravity of the misconduct cannot be minimised by the fact that he was not earlier caught indulging in dishonest conduct.

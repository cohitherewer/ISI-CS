 Safety fine on railways 

 New Delhi, May 3 (PTI): The state consumer commission has asked the railways to pay Rs 10 lakh to relatives of a passenger who died in an accident at a manned crossing.

 Commission chief justice J.D. Kapoor said it is the duty of the railways to see that no untoward incident occurs on the tracks or on platforms or inside trains because of negligence.

 Ram Kishan, who was on a train, suffered fatal injuries when hit by iron doors being carried on a rickshaw at a manned crossing. The complaint said it was the duty of the guard at the crossing to stop any person from coming so near a train. The commission said it wants to impress upon the authorities to take safety measures at crossings.

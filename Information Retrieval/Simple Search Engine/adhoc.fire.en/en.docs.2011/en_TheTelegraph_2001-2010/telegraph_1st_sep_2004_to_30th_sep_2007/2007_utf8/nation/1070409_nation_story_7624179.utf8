 Bike bomb greets PM in Guwahati

 Guwahati, April 8: A bomb blast killed one man and wounded several as Manmohan Singh addressed a gathering less than 10 km away, sending shivers down the spine of the Prime Ministers security ahead of his scheduled visit to a rebel stronghold tomorrow.

 Eyewitnesses said they saw two youths on a motorcycle slowing down at a speed-breaker before hitting an auto-rickshaw. They fell down but got up quickly and scampered away, said Monu Begum. The bomb exploded immediately after.

 Inspector general of police (law and order) D.K. Pathak said the youths were probably carrying the bomb to a specific location when they met with an accident, which triggered the explosion. I am not in a position to fix blame for the blast on any individual or group. The case is being investigated, he added.

 The blast occurred on F.A. Road in Kumarpara, which is within 10 km of the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium at Amingaon where Singh was addressing a gathering after laying the foundation stone of a second bridge over the Brahmaputra in Guwahati.

 Immediately after the explosion, Dispur sounded an alert in Upper Assam as the Prime Minister is due in Lepetkata, over 400 km away in Dibrugarh, to formally inaugurate a gas cracker project in an area where the rebels are strong.

 Todays explosion was so powerful that the motorcycle was hurled several feet above the ground. Windowpanes of many houses in the vicinity were shattered. Inamul Haque, a 30-year-old tailor from Dhubri, died while being taken to hospital.

 Sikander Ali, a 13-year-old, escaped with hand injuries. Another survivor, Ajay Sarkar, a rickshaw-puller who suffered splinter injuries in his legs and chest, said he heard a deafening noise and felt something hit him. 

 Doctors treating the 11 wounded said the condition of three was critical.

 Earlier in the day, chaos marked the programme at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium. A near-stampede occurred at the entrance when the footfall exceeded the seating capacity. Health and family welfare minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had to climb on top of a wall with a loudspeaker to pacify the crowd.

 When mediapersons stranded outside the gate requested senior police officers to ensure that they could enter, they were allegedly told to go wherever they liked, which infuriated the reporters and led to a media boycott.

 The second bridge over the Brahmaputra will be part of the east-west corridor project. Scheduled to be completed by April 2010, the 1,494-metre-long bridge will be built by the National Highways Authority of India at a cost of Rs 238.44 crore.

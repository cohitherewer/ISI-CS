 TV tax threat recedes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 11: A meeting today of the Group of Ministers that was to decide on a television tax has been postponed even as the government denied it was planning such a cess.

 PTI reported information and broadcasting minister P.R. Das Munshi as saying there was no such proposal by his ministry. I emphatically and categorically deny that there is any plan to impose a licence fee or cess either on radio or TV sets, he said.

 A proposal to introduce an annual licence fee of Rs 500 for every colour TV set, a one-time levy on each TV set at the time of purchase and a tax on private channels were on the Group of Ministers table. The funds were meant to help the cash-strapped Prasar Bharati. 

 The Group of Ministers, headed by home minister Shivraj Patil, has to decide soon as the case is coming up in the Supreme Court in August.

 Set up last year, the group is looking into making Prasar Bharati financially independent. The public broadcaster now depends heavily on grants from the government.

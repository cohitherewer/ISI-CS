 Napoleons 3 kisses and the bullish Hemingway

 London, June 4 (Reuters): One of the rarest and most touching of Austrian banker Albin Schrams collection is a passionate letter written by an apologetic Napoleon to his wife-to-be, Josephine, the morning after a furious argument.

 I send you three kisses one on your heart, one on your mouth and one on your eyes, wrote the chastened lover in a spidery scrawl full of corrections and crossings out.

 Schram began amassing the archive in the early 1970s, steadily building up one of the largest and most comprehensive collections outside a major museum.

 Although an inveterate collector, Schram wasnt interested in conservation or display the letters were kept in an old metal cabinet in the laundry room of his villa in Lausanne, Switzerland.

 When he died in 2005, his family barely knew they were there.

 One of the most prized lots is a note written by metaphysical poet John Donne to Lady Kingsmill a day after the death of her husband in October 1624.

 Urging her not to presume to contest Gods actions, Donne who was dean of St Pauls Cathedral at the time, adds: Although we could direct him to do them better.

 Another of interest is a letter written by Ernest Hemingway to the American poet and critic Ezra Pound in 1925, explaining why bulls are better than literary critics.

 Bulls dont run reviews. Bulls of 25 dont marry old women of 55 and expect to be invited to dinner. Bulls do not get you cited as co-respondent in Society divorce trials. Bulls dont borrow money. Bulls are edible after they have been killed.

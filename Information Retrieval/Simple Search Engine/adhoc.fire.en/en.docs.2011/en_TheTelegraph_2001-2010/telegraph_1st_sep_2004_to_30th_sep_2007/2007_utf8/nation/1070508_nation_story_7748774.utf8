 Advani daughter

 Bhopal, May 7 (PTI): The Madhya Pradesh Congress today lodged a police complaint against BJP leader L.K. Advanis daughter Pratibha, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and culture minister Lakshmikant Sharma, accusing them of insulting the national flag, police said.

 The police said a written complaint was received by Shyamala Hills police station, and the next course of action will be decided after a probe.

 Congress general secretary and spokesperson Deepchand Yadav alleged that the colour red was used in the national flag instead of saffron during the screening of Pratibha Advanis short film Vandematharam at Rabindhra Bhavan here yesterday.

 This amounted to disrespecting the national flag, he alleged.

 House panel trashes EC criminal clause

 New Delhi, March 15: A parliamentary standing committee, formed to prevent gangsters like Abu Salem and Dawood Ibrahim from contesting polls, has rejected an Election Commission proposal to debar persons with criminal records from fighting elections.

 The committee one of whose members is Sadhu Yadav, accused in several criminal cases has recommended that only a person eluding trial for over a year should be barred from polls.

 The panels report said that an accused can be disqualified only of he is declared an quot;absconder quot; by a court.

 The committee on personnel, public grievances, law and justice today tabled the preliminary report in both Houses. 

 It had been asked by the Union law ministry to look into the criteria for barring people from contesting polls.

 The report, though, deals only with the issue of disqualification on the ground of charges having been framed against a person. A comprehensive report covering all aspects of contesting polls would be tabled by August, committee chairman Sudarsana Natchiappan said.

 The committee said the poll panels proposal to disqualify a person following the framing of charges against him went against the basic principles of criminal law.

 The MPs said a person should be disqualified only if convicted or declared an absconder. The committee felt that a political party in power can influence the prosecution into filing a chargesheet.

 The report said a court can frame charges against an accused after merely looking into the chargesheet with supporting evidence and other material furnished by the prosecution, and without giving sufficient opportunity to the accused to defend himself and plead his case against the charges so framed.

 We cannot change the basic structure of law just to prevent criminalisation of politics, Natchiappan said.

 He added all political parties as well as the Union home ministry had backed the committees recommendation.

 New Delhi, Jan. 27: When Archbishop and Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu, another Nobel awardee, Muhammad Yunus, Lord Bhikhu Parekh, Sri Lankan Gandhian Peace Prize winner A.T. Ariyaratne and other distinguished persons walk into the capitals Vigyan Bhavan the hub of high-powered meets they will probably not have to put up with what other illustrious invitees in the past have: mounds of debris on the supposedly manicured lawns, uneven seats in the convention halls, shrieking acoustics, carelessly strewn scraps of paper and not-so-clean loos.

 Thanks to Sonia Gandhi, the employees of the central public works department (CPWD) were on their toes from this morning, trying to meet her expectations. By the Congresss reckoning, that is not going to be easy.

 The Congress president left no stone unturned to ensure that the distinguished guests participating in the international conference to mark the centenary of Mahatma Gandhis satyagraha will not be subject to the typical flaws associated with mega events in India.

 After all, this is the first international event she is hosting and more importantly, her party sources stressed: She doesnt want anything to go wrong in a function to commemorate the life, philosophy and legacy of the Father of the Nation.

 No wonder minister of state for external affairs Anand Sharma, Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel and Congress treasurer Motilal Vora, who are members of the centenary committee, will be on their toes this weekend. The CPWD staff, who looked forward to a quiet weekend before the convention starts on Monday, were told to turn up on Sunday.

 This morning, after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh opened a satyagraha exhibition in which Sonia was present, the accompanying entourage was about to leave. Suddenly, Sonia said she wanted to inspect the place. Those who thought it would be a perfunctory exercise were mistaken.

 Sonia checked every room in the sprawling complex, made sure the chairs, tables and mikes were in place and the carpets and floors were spotless. She also made sure the electricity fittings worked and there were no dysfunctional connections or unhinged wires.

 Sonia checked on the lawns and discovered that piles of debris, left over after repairs, had not been towed away. She reportedly expressed her disapproval. 

 The staff were also told there should be no traffic snarl-ups on Monday and Tuesday and that all vehicles, bearing the official passes, should be allowed inside the car park without ado.

 If that was not enough of a drill, the staff had another thing coming. Before departing, Sonia informed them she would show up later for another recce.

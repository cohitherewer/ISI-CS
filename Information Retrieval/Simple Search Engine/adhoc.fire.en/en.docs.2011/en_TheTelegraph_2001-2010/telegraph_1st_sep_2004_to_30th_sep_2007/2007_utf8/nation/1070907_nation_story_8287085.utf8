 Girl sale foiled in Calcutta

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 6: Police 

 rescued a girl about to be sold for Rs 1 lakh in front of 

 Science City late tonight.

 The 20-year-old girl was brought to Calcutta from Madhya Pradesh a month ago by traffickers who kept her confined to a room at a red light zone in the north of the city.

 The sale of the girl was foiled when a police squad patrolling the EM Bypass came across a Sumo cruising in a suspicious manner.

 We forced the driver to stop the car. A couple and a young woman were on the rear seat, Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police, said.

 The couple were later identified as Niraj Singh and Soni Singh. On sustained questioning, it was found that the girl had been brought over from Madhya Pradesh.

 They were planning to sell the girl for Rs 1 lakh. But we are yet to identify the buyer, an officer said. The couple have been arrested.

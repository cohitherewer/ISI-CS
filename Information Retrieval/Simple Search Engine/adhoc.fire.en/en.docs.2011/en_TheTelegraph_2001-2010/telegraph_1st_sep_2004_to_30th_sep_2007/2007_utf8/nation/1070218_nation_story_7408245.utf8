 Navy pitches for more subs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: The navy has sought clearance from the defence ministry for a proposal to acquire six more submarines to replace its ageing fleet. 

 Despite having contracted Scorpene submarines in 2005, naval headquarters has assessed that it could be decommissioning vessels faster than replenishments can be made.

 The navy has reasoned that the Scorpene submarines would not be inducted in another four years but it would be de-commissioning some of the older vessels from its silent arm in that period.

 The navys submarine arm is said to have 10 Sindhughosh (Kilo class), four HDW 209 (Shishumar class) and two Foxtrot class vessels in service. All the submarines are of pre-1980s vintage.

 The Scorpene submarines were contracted in 2005 for around Rs 16,000 crore but the first of the Scorpenes would not be available till 2011. Six submarines are to be inducted from the makers DCN Thales and six more are to be manufactured under licence at Mumbais Mazagon Docks.

 But the navy has not replenished its fleet in the last decade and concerns about the submarines reaching the end of their technical life was prompting the need for more submarines, a naval headquarters source said. 

 The request for proposals (tender) for at least six more submarines was likely to be sent out shortly. Among the competitors for the order are likely to be Russia with the Amur class and Germanys HDW that was blacklisted but has since been cleared by courts to participate in Indian defence purchases.

 The navy is also planning to buy 16 helicopters. Lockheed Martin is a contender for the navys orders for the P-3C Orion long-range maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare aircraft.

 Aqeel wife smells plot

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 5: DJ Aqeel, who rocked the AbAsh wedding with chart-topping mixes, was detained at Dubai airport this evening with suspected drugs.

 Aqeel, said to be the countrys highest-paid DJ, had gone to Dubai to inaugurate a night club. 

 Aqueels wife Farah has defended her husband, saying the drug capsules were planted as part of a plot to malign him.

 He was detained by Dubai police around 6 pm after 0.4 gm of Ecstasy was found in his haversack. We were also informed that the tip-off came from Mumbai. We have our lawyer there and we have no reason to be worried. He doesnt take drugs and never had such a problem, Farah said in Mumbai.

 Farah, a jewellery designer and actor Zayed Khans sister, believes the capsules could have been planted by an organiser or a rival, who might have a grudge against Aqeel. 

 You cant trust anyone these days. We will find out who did this. But at the moment, we have to get him out, she added. 

 But Farah added that Aqeel performs so much that he falls asleep at airports and I dont know if somebody has put it in his bag.

 Aqeel, who turned 34 last month, is to be produced in court on Wednesday. He will undergo a urine test to determine whether he takes drugs.

 Farah said the Dubai anti-narcotics cell had tested the DJs blood and he was completely clean.

 She said no consumption of Ecstasy was found and Dubai airport authorities dismissed the case, which went back to the police at the airport.

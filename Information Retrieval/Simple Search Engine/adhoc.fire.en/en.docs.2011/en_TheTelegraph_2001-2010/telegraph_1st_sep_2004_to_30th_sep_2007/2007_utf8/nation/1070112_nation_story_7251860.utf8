 Full-time beggar to social welfare officer

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Jan. 11: Come Republic Day, and the district magistrate of Vizianagaram could be handing a citation to a man who till four months ago begged for a living.

 Today, M. Lakshmi Narasimhulu is no longer a seeker but a guardian of the poor. As a government welfare official in charge of 19 hostels for poor backward-class students, the 35-year-old is the toast of NGOs and administrative circles.

 Narasimhulu gives the entire credit for his rise to his late father, a lifelong beggar, who spent a part of the alms he received to educate his two sons and daughter.

 My family has been begging for centuries. But it was my fathers dedication which has brought me to this position today, said the young man, who was appointed a gazetted officer in the Andhra Pradesh social welfare department last October.

 Narasimhulu belongs to the sub-caste Jangamalu, who visit farmers homes and entertain them by singing devotional songs, receiving alms in cash or in the form of rice, pulses or tamarind. They sometimes do odd jobs for the farmers, too.

 At his hometown of Rajam in the coastal district of Vizianagaram, Narasimhulu made about Rs 400-500 a month begging.

 Now, as the assistant social welfare officer for the district, he earns about Rs 12,000 a month in salary and perks and has traded his dhoti for a shirt and a pair of trousers.

 Just three years ago, however, the future had seemed bleak when his father Meegada Lakshmi Narayana died at the age of 55. Narasimhulu, then in the final year of his undergraduate course, gave up his studies and took to full-time begging to support his younger brother and sister, both of whom were in college.

 But a local merchant came to his aid, paying his tuition and examination fees and the young man was able to graduate in June 2005. I begged for survival during the day and continued studies at a night college, Narasimhulu said.

 Graduation paved the way for him to sit for the state public service commission examination. He qualified in March last year but had to wait seven months for his appointment, thanks to official tardiness.

 But Narasimhulu isnt complaining. His brother and sister, too, graduated last year. His sister is now a pharmacist at a government hospital and his brother has joined the navy.

 His elevation has not turned Narasimhulu indifferent to his beggar community, whom he advises to educate their children. He recently married a woman from his caste.

 Does he face any prejudice at work? Both my seniors and subordinates support me, Narasimhulu said.

 District officials said a request has been sent to the state government to nominate Narasimhulu for some sort of presidential honour on Republic Day. It may be too late for that and too early for someone in the fourth month of his government job but he is unlikely to miss out completely. The district administration has its own plans to felicitate Narasimhulu on January 26.

 Maoist jungle show with a warning

 Maoists at the convention

 New Delhi, Feb. 25: Ousted from their base in Andhra Pradeshs Nallamala forest, the Maoists have flexed their muscles by claiming to have held a month-long convention somewhere near the Orissa-Jharkhand-Chhattisgarh borders.

 Over 100 delegates from 16 states, making up the core leadership of the CPI (Maoist), reportedly sneaked into the jungles, cocking a snook at central and state intelligence networks and the huge paramilitary presence.

 The convention was held from mid-January till mid-February, said a media statement and CD released by the rebels last week.

 The meeting passed a resolution on political issues, worked out new strategies to fight the government, and elected a new central committee. It re-elected Ganapathi as the CPI (Maoist) general secretary.

 The media statement, signed by Ganapathi and dated February 19, warns the government that the Maoists plan to widen their movement and theatre of attacks.

 For instance, the Peoples Liberation Guerrilla Army will be turned into a Peoples Liberation Army to make the switch from hit-and-run guerrilla warfare into what the rebels call a mobile war.

 Till now, what the action squads mostly did was launch surprise strikes on the security forces and vanish quickly. Now, action squads will leave the jungles and roam around towns and villages, ready to carry out attacks whenever they receive assignments.

 Several base areas will be set up in states such as Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Jharkhand, where the rebels so far only had guerrilla zones with their base confined to Nallamala. The statement said the establishment of base areas was the immediate, basic and central task.

 The conclave exhorted tribals, peasants and the urban poor to protect their land, homes and the forests against the drive to acquire land for special economic zones.

 Huge projects like Posco, Kalinganagar, bauxite mines in Orissa, Chargaon and Raoghat in Chhattisgarh, bauxite mines and Polavaram (irrigation and hydel) project in Andhra Pradesh, iron ore mines and uranium projects in Jharkhand are leading to massive displacement of Adivasis and their marginalisation. Besides, the 300 planned SEZs are all set to create de facto foreign enclaves within our country, Ganapathis statement said.

 The convention urged nearly all insurgent groups, from Kashmir to the Northeast, to fight against the oppressive Indian state as they have the right of self-determination, including their right to secede from the autocratic Indian state (which they were forced to join).

 Three guerrilla companies ringed the venue, sending out patrols to watch the security forces movements. People in the surrounding villages acted as the partys eyes and ears, the statement said.

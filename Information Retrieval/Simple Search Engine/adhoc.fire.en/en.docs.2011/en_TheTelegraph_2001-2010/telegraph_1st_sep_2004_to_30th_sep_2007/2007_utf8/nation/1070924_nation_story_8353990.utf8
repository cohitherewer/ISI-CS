 Langur tries but monkey 

at large 

 MANDIRA NAYAR 

 New Delhi, Sept. 23: Dart guns proved useless, so Delhi airport set a langur to catch a monkey.

 The simian was first spotted at the international terminal on September 17. Three days later, when wildlife experts waiting with stun guns thought they had got rid of it, the monkey came back on Thursday.

 After waiting to catch it for two more days, a langur was brought in. The langur was made to sit on the roof from where the monkey came in, an official said. 

 Posting langurs to scare away monkeys is a practice common in North and South Blocks the address of the ministries of defence, finance and home. Both have their official langurs to keep bureaucrats safe. 

 But it turned out that the monkey was smarter. Jumping from one air-conditioning duct to another, it did not fall into the langur trap. Now, the langur, too, has been packed off.

 The next trick being tried by wildlife experts is putting up silver-painted cages on the air-conditioning ducts. 

 The cages will have papaya that monkeys love, an official said. We hope it thinks the cages are part of the AC machinery. As they are trigger-activated, we can then trap it, the official added.

 Delhi airport, which aspires to be ranked among the best in the world, has more wildlife menace to contend with. It has hired Wildlife SOS, an animal rescue NGO, to prepare a report on animals found on its premises. 

 Six jackals, two cats and 10 dogs were captured from the airport in December.

 Biman spills N-dilemma

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Biman Bose

 Calcutta, Aug. 24: Biman Bose today betrayed the Lefts difficulties in convincing people that the nuclear deal is an issue on which the Centre should be toppled.

 People may not understand the technical complexities involved in the nuclear deal. Everything will depend on the level of peoples consciousness, the Left Front chairman said.

 The comments reflect the dilemma within the Bengal unit of the CPM in case elections become unavoidable. Most state leaders are reluctant to face the electorate on an issue such as the nuclear deal that is unlikely to sway the masses.

 We have to explain to them (the people) how the deal could affect their livelihood. We will make them understand that the deal is fraught with multiple dangers as Indian defence, agriculture, industry and education would come to be controlled by US policies once we accept it, he said after a Left Front meeting today. 

 Asked whether the Left would wait to withdraw support till people realised the dangers, Bose said: Depending on the situation, people may come to understand things in 10 days which take a year to fathom. 

 However, the Bengal CPM secretary denied any division within the party on the nuclear deal. 

 Bose said the party would watch Delhis moves closely during the governing body and general council meetings of the International Atomic Energy Agency in September. 

 If the government opens talks there on implementing the deal, we have to take extreme steps, he said. 

 After the state secretariat meeting this morning, CPM veteran Jyoti Basu said: The ball is in the Congresss court. We are yet to receive the governments reply to our warning not to proceed.

 Other leaders hinted that the party wanted the government to go slow.

 However, a party state secretariat member close to Basu said the party would try its best to avoid mid-term elections.

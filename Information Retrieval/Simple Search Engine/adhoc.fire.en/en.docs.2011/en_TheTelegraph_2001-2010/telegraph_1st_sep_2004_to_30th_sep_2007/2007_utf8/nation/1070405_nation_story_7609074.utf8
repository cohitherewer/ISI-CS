 Mallika edges Modi out in TV tussle

 Mallika Sarabhai: Democracy tips for chief minister

 Ahmedabad, April 4: Hell hath no fury like Narendra Modi scorned, especially when he is elbowed out by Mallika Sarabhai.

 Doordarshan has dropped three Gujarat government-sponsored programmes glorifying the BJP chief minister and projecting his regimes achievements and begun airing a series made by the dancer and social activist Modi loves to hate.

 A furious Modi took up the matter with Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, when he met him in Delhi recently. 

 Sources said the chief minister criticised the Centre and the Planning Commission for sponsoring and reviving Sarabhais serial. 

 Modi was miffed because Doordarshan did not consult his government while giving the go-ahead to the shows on development issues such as womens empowerment, health, youth and human rights although these are state subjects.

 The TV serial had earlier been terminated when Prasar Bharati faced stiff resistance from the Gujarat government. It was revived recently, though in a truncated form. 

 L.P. Mandarwala, the deputy director-general of the Ahmedabad Doordarshan Kendra, described Sarabhais programme as high-quality stuff, but added that we also rejected some of the programmes on technical grounds. 

 Mandarwala refused to say why the programmes produced by the state information department, Yash Gatha, Parivartan and Vikas Panth, had been dropped. He only smiled when asked about their quality and content.

 Sarabhai is unfazed by Modis reaction. Im neither shocked nor disturbed by the development. I believe in the teachings of the Bhagvad Gita. So I know how to handle such situations. If Gujarat is Modis karm bhoomi, so is it mine, she said. 

 If he really believes in democracy and womens empowerment, he should be encouraging me. He should come and tell me that I keep on producing such programmes.

 The BJPs decision to stage a protest at the Ahmedabad Doordarshan office, however, has left Sarabhai rattled. She said she would seek protection.

 Sarabhais serial, which gets two hours of airtime every day, has also had local producers up in arms. They allege the guidelines for inviting proposals from private TV producers were not followed while allotting the slot to Sarabhai. Several producers have moved Gujarat High Court, challenging the contract.

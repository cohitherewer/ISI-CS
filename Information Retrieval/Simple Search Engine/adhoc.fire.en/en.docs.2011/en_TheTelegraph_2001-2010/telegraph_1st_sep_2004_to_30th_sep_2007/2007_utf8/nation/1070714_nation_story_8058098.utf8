 Support glare on Haneef

 July 13: Australian police suspect that Mohammed Haneef provided support to those behind the failed UK bombings even if the detained Indian doctor himself wasnt linked to the plots.

 Haneef, 27, is a second cousin to prime suspect and former Bangalorean Kafeel Ahmed. The police have evidence that he had contacted Kafeel through a Net chat in March-April this year, officials said.

 Kafeel, 27, who was doing an engineering PhD in Cambridge, drove a flaming jeep into the Glasgow airport terminal on June 30 a day after two Mercedes bombs had failed to go off in London. His brother Sabeel, 26, a doctor working near Liverpool, has also been detained in the case.

 The seized documents suggest Haneef was not very close to his cousins but stayed with them in Britains Liverpool from 2004 till 2006. After moving to Australia, he had stayed in touch by phone and online messaging.

 Haneef was arrested after his mobile SIM card was found with Sabeel, who had used it to access a cheaper phone deal.

 The investigators suspect a further possible link between Haneef and Iraqi doctor Bilal Abdulla, 27, the only person charged in the case. Bilal was Kafeels co-passenger in the Glasgow attack.

 One of the suspects is believed to have contacted Haneef last month and congratulated him on the birth of his child. Haneef was arrested on July 2 as he tried to leave Brisbane for India on a one-way ticket, saying he was rushing back to visit his wife and baby daughter, born on June 26.

 The police say they have evidence that Haneef has not been entirely truthful (about) his attempt to leave Australia, The Australian newspaper has reported.

 The documents and material seized include 1,636 photographs, two cellphones, a 40-gigabyte hard drive belonging to Haneef and an 80-gigabyte hard drive belonging to fellow Gold Coast doctor Mohammed Asif Ali. Ali was one of the six Indian doctors questioned in Australia, of whom all except Haneef have been released.

 The police are also looking at a personal digital assistant, two 128-megabyte flash drives, a digital camera, email documents, computer discs and a global positioning system. The volume of evidence will take a significant period to analyse, a police source said.

 Haneefs lawyer Peter Russo said the doctors apartment had been left unliveable by police searches.

 Reports had said the long detention and Haneefs consequent failure to pay rent would lead to his eviction. But Russo said the landlords concerns had been addressed.

 Faith shield for AP shrines

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, June 8: Andhra Pradesh today promulgated an ordinance forbidding propagation of a religion at centres or shrines of other faiths. Offenders face three years in jail and fines up to Rs 5,000.

 The curbs were already in place around Tirumala, but the ordinance has widened the area around the Balaji temple where propagation will not be allowed. 

 It also brings 22 more temples in the state under the purview of the law. This includes shrines in Simhachalam, Annavaram, Dwaraka Tirumala (near Elur in West Godavari), Vijayawada, Srikalahasti, Srisailam, Bhadrachalam and Mangalagiri.

 The ordinance empowers the government to prohibit propagation of any religion other than the one practised in the notified places, chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy said.

 Recently, Christian missionaries were found distributing handbills and sticking posters in Tirumala, angering the Tirumala Parirakshana Samiti, an RSS-dominated pressure group. The BJP staged dharnas in Hyderabad.

 In a separate order today, the government declared the area around the Balaji temple a divya kshetram (divine zone) to be governed by the Tirumala-Tirupati Devasthanam. 

 All seven hillocks around Tirumala will now be part of the zone. The temple is on the Sheshachalam peak. 

 Earlier, a panchayat order had limited the temple authorities writ to two hills. It said tribal villages on other hills would hold polls and be part of the state administration something that doesnt apply to the areas under the temple authorities.

 Panchayat laws, elections and union activity are not allowed in the divya kshetram areas. The land, assets and the welfare of the people working at the shrine are in the hands of the deity and the temple administration, said K.V. Ramanachari, the executive officer of the temple authorities.

 Small mercy for Sanjay

 - Actor gets attached toilet, spared the morning queue

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI 

Mumbai, Aug. 3: Every morning, Sanjay Dutt will begin his day at Yerwada Central Prison feeling lucky.

 He has an attached loo, a jail official explained.

 Fights over water and toilet rights are an everyday affair at the overcrowded jail, where 3,500 use amenities meant for 2,000. Inmates have to wake up at 5am to finish their ablutions in time for breakfast by 7.

 The attached bathroom will allow Sanjay, who was brought to the jail today, an extra hour of sleeping-in.

 Sanjay prisoner number C-15170, according to PTI is the only one with the privilege. Even the others in solitary confinement such as stamp-paper scamster Abdul Karim Telgi or some of the death-row Bombay blast convicts must share toilets.

 The official reason is the threat to the actor from inmates who were in Arun Gawlis gang. Many of Gawlis men are here and they hate Sanjay for his previous alleged closeness to D-company (a rival of Gawlis), the jail official said.

 There have been a few other concessions, too. Custom-made apparel, for one.

 The filmstar was measured up by the jail tailor today and given a new set of the prison attire a white kurta, an ankle-length white pantaloon and a white cap after a couple of hours.

 We usually hand out readymade uniforms, but Sanjays physique is such that he could not fit into any of them, the official said.

 The new arrival was handed a jail manual so he could familiarise himself with the prison rules.

 He just flipped through it. Later, when he was interviewed to find out what prison job would suit him best, he asked a couple of questions about prison rules, the official said. We pointed out that the answers were printed in the manual. But he was told about them anyway.

 It didnt seem from the interview that the actor possessed any skill that would readily fit him into any of the jail jobs meant for those sentenced to rigorous imprisonment, state inspector-general of prisons Satish Mathur said.

 He said he was an actor and could act. But that is of no use to us. So hell have to be placed as a trainee in one of the jobs. He will be rotated between a couple of jobs of his choice before we decide which suits him best, Mathur said.

 Sanjay will have to work seven-hour shifts from tomorrow. Its likely he will begin by helping in the kitchen and then move on to other jobs like gardening or tailoring, the jail official said.

 Inmates at Yerwada work till 6pm with two breaks one for lunch and another for a short rest. Dinner is served at 7 and the lights are out at 8.

 Burning protest

 An anti-tobacco NGO has invoked the Right to Information Act to find out if Sanjay was allowed to smoke in the Arthur Road Jail, where he was lodged till last evening, a PTI report said.

 The Burning Brains Society has written to Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, reminding him that smoking is illegal in prisons.

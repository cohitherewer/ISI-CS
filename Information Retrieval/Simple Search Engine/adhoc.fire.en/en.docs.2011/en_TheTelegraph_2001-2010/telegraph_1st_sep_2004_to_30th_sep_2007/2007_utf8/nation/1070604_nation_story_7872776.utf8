 Chennai, June 3: Punniyakoti and Alamelu will never tire of telling their grandchildren how they were married before a crowd of VIPs at the chief ministers home.

 They just missed watching the days biggest gift arrive, though. Two huge elephants, crafted out of pure silver in Jaipur, were brought in by four men followed by dozens of young women carrying 84 kinds of fruits and sweets.

 The gift, of course, was for M. Karunanidhi whose 84th birthday was celebrated like a royal wedding at Chennais DMK headquarters today.

 Ministers were beaming, hundreds were roaring, music was playing and the two 84-kg elephants arrived on a wooden platform as if in a baraat.

 The wedding, however, had already taken place at the chief ministers residence, moments after the young couple had tiptoed in with the stream of visitors.

 The 20-something Punniyakoti had grabbed his blushing fiancees hands and leapt out of the crowd to find themselves face to face with the venerable Kalaignar.

 No, the garlands in their hands werent meant for the birthday boy. They were to be placed around each others necks with a mangalsutra thrown in. The politician neednt feel completely left out he may bless the couple.

 And thats how Punniyakoti, the DMKs suburban Poonamalle town deputy secretary, came to marry his sweetheart right in front of his party boss.

 Karunanidhi should be pleased the idea of marriage without a priest was advocated by social reformer Periyar, seen as an ideological ancestor of the DMK.

 The groom said getting married with the Kalaignars blessings had always been his wish, and he spent the six years since his engagement puzzling over how to get the opportunity. I just never could get an appointment, he said. And it had to be an auspicious day, too.

 The party obviously shared the same sentiment, deciding to mark the occasion in a bigger way than usual, perhaps with the recent rift in the Karunanidhi clan in mind.

 The chief minister walked into the Kalaignar Arangam, the big hall at the party complex, flanked by younger son Stalin and party leaders, including Union minister T.R. Baalu. He posed for photographs with the two silver elephants, gifted by Stalin acolyte Sridhar.

 Karunanidhis day had begun as early as 4 am at the CIT Colony home of poetess daughter Kanimozhi. His younger wife Rajathi Ammal and some other family members greeted him there before Karunanidhi drove down to his Gopalapuram home.

 There he exchanged garlands with elder wife Dayalu Ammal and accepted a piece of cake from her as his four sons, including Stalin and the eldest Azhagiri, watched.

 The countrys most powerful politicians rang him with greetings, and a stream of political and literary figures came calling.

 But the show was stolen by two nervous young people who now have an anniversary in common with Karunanidhi.

 Poll axe on UPs top babu

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 16: Continuing to shake up the Uttar Pradesh bureaucracy ahead of the Assembly polls, the Election Commission today removed the states top bureaucrat.

 Uttar Pradesh chief secretary N.C. Bajpai has been replaced with a 1970 batch IAS official, Shambhu Nath.

 Two days ago, the Election Commission similarly removed Uttar Pradesh police chief Bua Singh and nine other police and administration officials.

 But the removal of a states chief secretary is a rare indictment by the Election Commission, signalling mistrust in the administrative machinery.

 The panels action follows visits to the state by chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami and other panel members, as well as complaints by the Opposition that the Samajwadi Party-run government would try to rig the polls.

 The commission draws legal teeth for the shake-up from clause 4 of Article 324 of the Constitution. Under this, the governor makes available, when requested by the poll panel, such staff as may be necessary for the discharge of the functions conferred on the Election Commission. 

 The panel, as the article says earlier, is conferred with the superintendence, direction and control of elections. 

 After the polling process is over, the government can appoint the officials back to their earlier posts.

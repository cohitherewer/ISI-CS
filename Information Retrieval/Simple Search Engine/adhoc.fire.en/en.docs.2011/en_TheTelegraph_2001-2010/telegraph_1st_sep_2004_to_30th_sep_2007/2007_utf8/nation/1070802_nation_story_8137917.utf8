 Headed to India? Take travel tips

 AMIT ROY 

 Big headache

 London, Aug. 1: UK passport holders travelling to India give British consular staff based in the country a big headache, according to a report being published tomorrow in London by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. 

 They tend to lose their passports, get cheated by local crooks and tend to catch all manner of diseases, giving British consular staff plenty of work to do. 

 In the year ending March 30, 2006, when there were 847,000 British visits to India (some repeat, no doubt), 144 passports were lost; 35 people were arrested; 52 needed hospital treatment; and there were 111 deaths. There were 914 serious assistance cases. 

 Conscious that many of the problems could be avoided by a little advance planning, the foreign offices Know Before You Go campaign is launching its latest British Behaviour Abroad report. 

 India, Thailand and Australia appear in the top 10 countries where Britons required consular assistance. 

 The high figures in India might well be a result of many British Asians visiting family members and foregoing usual travel preparations such as vaccinations or travel insurance, says the report. 

 The foreign office revealed: Over 600,000 British tourists visit India every year. Most of these visits are trouble-free. The main type of incident for which British nationals required consular assistance in India in 2006 related to lost/stolen passports, medical cases and drugs offences. 

 Brits clearly cause much more trouble in other countries. The period April 5-March 6 saw 1,368 Britons arrested in the US; 955 hospitalised in Greece; 376 British citizens die in France and 6,078 lose their passports in Spain. 

 In the last category, it is safe to assume many young people simply got drunk. 

 The report highlights new trends: The Czech Republic features as one of the countries where most consular assistance is required with a disproportionate number of lost passports, arrests and hospitalisations. This is likely to be due to the massive influx of hen and stag parties to Prague. 

 What the report means is that Prague has become the new sex capital of Europe, with many exotic attractions on offer at relatively cheap prices.

 British media reports have stated that strip clubs on St Wenceslas Square, where massive demonstrations in 1989 marked the beginning of the end for the communist regime in Czechoslovakia, have become magnets for young Britons. 

 Employees hustle drunken young men into places such as Club K5 a venue boasting an oasis of entertainment and relaxation directly in the centre of the Golden City and which has special theme rooms catering to Roman, oriental, knight and nobleman tastes. 

 In comparison, visiting the Red Fort in Delhi or the Victoria Memorial in Calcutta may appear positively dull. 

 The foreign office country report for India offers common sense advice: Beware of the risk of street crime and take personal security measures, including taking particular care to safeguard your passport and credit/ATM cards, particularly when travelling by bus and train. There has been an increase in handbag snatching in Delhi. 

 It adds: Be aware of what you are eating and drinking. There have been reports of travellers being drugged and robbed on trains. Be wary of confidence tricksters, particularly in Agra and Jaipur. They promise a substantial cash reward for delivery of jewellery abroad but only in return for an initial deposit. The jewellery is invariably worthless and the deposit, often amounting to thousands of pounds, is lost. 

 It also says: Avoid walking alone in isolated spots in the popular tourist areas after dark. There have been incidents of sexual offences against women in Delhi and Goa. Female travellers are advised to observe and respect local dress and customs and to take particular care. 

 With more than 100 flights each way, there should be greater availability of seats but the foreign office, probably aware of the ways of Air-India in particular, points out: Between the months of December and April, flights leaving India become very full. Passengers may find themselves bumped off flights even if they have confirmed seats. All international departures must therefore be re-confirmed at least 72 hours before departure. 

 Foreign and Commonwealth Office minister Meg Munn said: One of the most important tasks for the foreign office is our work to help British nationals in distress overseas. As this report shows, although some of the incidents people face are unavoidable, many can be prevented with a little planning and careful preparation. 

 Much the same is true for Indians visiting Europe. In fact, the external affairs ministry should warn women not to stuff their jewellery into suitcases because baggage handlers at Heathrow called Thief Row possess almost a sixth sense about what is packed.

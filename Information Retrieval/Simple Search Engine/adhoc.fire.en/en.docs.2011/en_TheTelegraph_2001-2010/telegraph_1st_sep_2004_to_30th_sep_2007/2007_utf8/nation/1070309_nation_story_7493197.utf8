 Judges for prisoners

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, March 8: India has named four retired judges to a committee that would ensure humane treatment and expedite the release of prisoners in India and Pakistan, especially those who have completed their jail terms.

 The four judges are Justice K.R. Vyas, Bombay High Court, Justices Amarjit Choudhary and S. Gill, Punjab amp; Haryana High Court, and Justice M.A. Khan from Delhi High Court.

 The proposal to set up such a committee had come from Pakistan during the visit of external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee in January.

 Mukherjee told the Rajya Sabha today that a team of relatives of prisoners of war (POWs) would visit Pakistani jails in April to verify Islamabads claim that there are no Indian POWs in that country.

 Mumbai plugged in, at others expense

 Sweating it out

 Mumbai, April 29: Mumbai wont have blackouts, its official now. The rest of Maharashtra, the countrys most industrialised state, will suffer longer power cuts this summer.

 Utilities have managed to source power for Mumbai from Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana to bridge massive shortfalls estimated in May, June, July and August. Mumbai will have no load shedding this summer. Some of the arrangements, however, will depend on power availability, said Rahul Asthana, principal secretary (energy) in the Maharashtra government.

 But, to remain the only bright spot in a dark Maharashtra, Mumbai will have to pay a high price its power will come at a cost of Rs 7 per unit, among the highest rates that households fork out anywhere in the country.

 Fingers had been crossed in Mumbai ever since it became apparent that the countrys commercial capital would lose the facility of uninterrupted power it has enjoyed for years.

 Huge billboards have sprung up across the city urging Mumbaikars to save power. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is considering issuing a diktat to housing societies to install solar geysers. 

 We are waiting for a go-ahead from the chief minister and will move as soon as his clearance comes. It (the order on solar geysers) will be the first of its kind in India, said Shubha Raul, the newly elected Shiv Sena mayor of Mumbai. 

 The civic body also plans a power audit that will monitor the electricity used or wasted on street lights. 

 The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission has asked Reliance Energy and Tata Power, which feed much of Mumbai, to explore the possibility of using energy-efficient lamps on streets or going for solar power options. The BMC and the companies will take a joint call on this. We want to set an example for the other metros, said BMC chief engineer (electrical) K. Charankar. 

 With most Mumbaikars living in cramped flats, sporadic power cuts since last year have brought home the need for a backup. 

 Residential societies, most of them tall buildings, are looking at having generators, common in Delhi and, now, even in parts of Calcutta. In Mumbai, though, the machines will offer relief that will go beyond heat: they will ensure that residents dont have to climb up to their flats after a hard days work.

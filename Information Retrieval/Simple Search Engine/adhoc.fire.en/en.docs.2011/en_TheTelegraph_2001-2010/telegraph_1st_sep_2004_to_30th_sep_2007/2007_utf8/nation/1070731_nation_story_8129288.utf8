 Heater wire to charge cell in jail

 For some people, being mobile could mean carrying on a conversation from within the four walls of a jail cell. For years, the use of mobiles by inmates has baffled wardens.

 This is happening despite a Russian mobile jammer the Karnataka prisons department installed at the Parappana Agrahara central jail, on the outskirts of Bangalore. But the problem is the jammer mostly sends tame signals. 

 On a surprise inspection recently, jail officials recovered two mobiles from an undertrial and a convict. The convict, it appeared, had been making threat calls to his rivals. The undertrial was ordering minions to collect his hafta (extortion money). Officials, who videotaped the search and seizure operation, were surprised that the convict was charging his phone by splitting the wire of a heater coil that he used for cooking.

 Jailers are still scratching their heads as to how the mobiles sneaked into to the cells. The suspicion, as in most such cases, has fallen on some of the men in uniform.

 Designs on animation pie

 An animation-training house has big designs on Hyderabad.

 Picasso Media has plans to open a 1,000-seat college in Hyderabad in collaboration with a Canadian institute.

 A. Reddy, the managing director of Delhi-based Picasso, said the aim is to provide quality education and equip animators with world-class technologies, including 3D skills.

 The courses will include a three-year BSc degree and an 18-month part time programme leading up to a diploma. A studio to produce animation films will be among the facilities. The investment will be $9 million (Rs 360 crore).

 Picasso, a Maharishi group firm, also plans another campus at Vishakhapatnam in two years to cater to the growing demand for animation skills and education in Andhra Pradesh. Reddy said India can grab a big slice of the $80-billion global animation pie if it has enough skilled hands.

 Egg them on, minus Maran

 M. Karunanidhi wants kids to eat more eggs, but doesnt need his one-time blue-eyed boy to egg him on any more.

 Early in July, on late Congress leader Kamrajs 104th birthday, the chief minister announced that his government would offer eggs thrice a week under the midday meal scheme in schools. So far, it was twice a week.

 But it wasnt the egg generosity that stood out at the event. The talking point was the absence of Dayanidhi Maran who, as the area MP, should ideally have been present.

 But the former Union ministers absence was hardly a damper for the DMK patriarch as he held forth on the virtues of eggs. He even drew a ripple of laughter when he joked that parents shouldnt expect a fourth one from the government.

 The programme wasnt short on leading lights, though. One of them was K. Azhagiri, Karunanidhis son and Marans arch rival. He lit up the stage with his smile.

 Cash cradles

 The Delhi government might just deliver where it really matters.

 Last week, the Sheila Dikshit cabinet cleared a Rs 5.5-crore scheme under which hospitals will be paid Rs 4,000 for each delivery involving women who cant afford pre-natal care. The other aim is to protect the girl child.

 The Mamta-friendly hospitals scheme will be merged with the Girl-child protection plan, under which parents are handed Rs 5,000 to bring up the third female child.

 The scheme will provide an opportunity for expectant mothers from the weaker sections to get the benefits of nursing homes, Dikshit said.

 Delhi: Photographer Samit Dass pictures of Memory Lanes in Metropolis from his days in Calcutta are on exhibition at the India Habitat Centre this Tuesday. The venue is the Delhi Delhi restaurant in the complex. The event will be on between 10am and 8pm.

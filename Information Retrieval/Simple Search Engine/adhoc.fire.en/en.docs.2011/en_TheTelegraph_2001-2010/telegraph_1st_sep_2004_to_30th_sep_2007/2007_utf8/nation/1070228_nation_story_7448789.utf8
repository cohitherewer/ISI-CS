 Slide down human index

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: India has slipped on the human development index (HDI), which includes income, health and education, but has picked up considerable points on the gender development index.

 The comparable absolute value for the three-dimensional (income, health and education) human development index for India has improved consistently over the years. But its relative ranking has remained sticky. Some countries in the region have done better than India, states the 2006-2007 Economic Survey.

 For instance, according to the UNDPs human development report, India has gone down from the 124th position on the HDI scale in 2000 to 126th in 2004. 

 On the scale of gender development index during this period, the country has gone up from the 105th position to 96th. 

 This may bring cheer to the government but not if it compares its performance with China and Sri Lanka.

 China has gone up from the 96th position to 81st and Sri Lanka from 77th to 64th in HDI. On the gender development index, China has gone up from 77th to 64th and Sri Lanka from 70th to 68th.

 The Economic Survey leaves no scope for complacency. The paramount need for making rapid strides in living standards, health, education, gender justice, welfare and development of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes continues, says the report.

 Last years Economic Survey had said the availability of resources alone will not guarantee development of the social sector. 

 It pointed that two factors which will make a crucial difference to the performance in this sector are efficient management and improved delivery of the plethora of projects the government is running at the grassroots.

 This years survey concentrates on the volume of schemes the government has introduced.

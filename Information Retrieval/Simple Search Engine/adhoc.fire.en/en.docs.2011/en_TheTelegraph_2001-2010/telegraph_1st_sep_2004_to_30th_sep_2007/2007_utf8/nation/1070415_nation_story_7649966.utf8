 Havildar guns down senior

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, April 14: A CRPF havildar shot dead his senior at Jammu airport late this evening in yet another incident of fragging.

 Police said the havildar entered into a heated argument with his deputy commandant around 8.30 pm and opened fire, killing the officer on the spot. The deceased has been identified as Nabal Singh from Haryana.

 The airport, one of the most protected in the country, is guarded by the CRPF round the clock.

 The senior superintendent of police, Jammu airport, Raghubir Singh, said what happened before the shootout is not yet known. The havildar has been arrested and is being questioned.

 This is the second such incident at the airport in six years. Four CRPF men were killed in 2001.

 Such incidents among troops, stressed by long separation from their families and continuous counter-insurgency duty, have been on the rise in Jammu and Kashmir.

 Israel admiral trip on way out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 6: Israels navy chief reaches New Delhi tonight in efforts to strengthen military cooperation with India even as he has resigned and is facing flak back home for perceived failures in a war last year.

 As has now become practice, the defence establishment has chosen not to formally announce the visit. This has less to do with the navy chiefs standing in Tel Aviv and more to do with Left protests against military relations with Israel.

 Vice-Admiral David Ben Bashat resigned in July after charges that the Israeli navy had failed to hold its own in the war against the Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israeli naval vessels were landing troops and firing at shore targets from the Mediterranean in the war. But a Hezbollah missile broke through Israels sophisticated defences and found a target in a missile corvette named the Hanit.

 After an inquiry by the government that pointed to failures in the higher command of Israels military, Bashat chose to resign. He is likely to demit office by the end of August. The investigation was not only on the navy, but also on the conduct of the war as such.

 Bashat is likely to visit Agra and the Western Naval Command headquarters in Mumbai before he flies back.

 Last month, the cabinet committee on security approved a Rs 10,000-crore joint venture with Israel to develop air defence systems. 

 The Indian Navy inducted the Israeli Barak ship-based anti-missile systems in 2003. Along with defence public sector outfits, the navy is party to a joint venture to produce a newer generation of the Barak missile by extending its range.

 Israel is currently the second largest supplier of military equipment to India but it is a distant second to Russia.

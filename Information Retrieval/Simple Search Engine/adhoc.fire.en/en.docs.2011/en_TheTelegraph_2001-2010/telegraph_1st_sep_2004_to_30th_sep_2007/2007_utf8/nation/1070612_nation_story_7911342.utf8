 New Delhi, June 11: Blame a West Asian cyclone for the killer heat wave sweeping across northern India and Pakistan.

 Cyclone Gonu, which struck Gulf state Oman last week killing about 50 people, nudged the southwest monsoon off the Indian coast and interfered with subcontinental wind patterns, officials at the Indian Meteorological Department said.

 Normally, when the monsoon hits the south-western coast, a low-pressure area forms over the Indo-Gangetic plains. It causes a system of hot, dry winds called the loo to blow over northern India.

 Thanks to the change in wind directions, the soaring mercury is accompanied with unusually high humidity, a combination that has claimed 102 lives in India and more than 50 in Pakistan.

 Making matters worse, the Met office said, the monsoon has veered off course, abandoning the late curve towards the west and escalating the heartlands suffering. But Bengal and other eastern states are likely to have heavy rain in the next few days.

 Delhi, broiling at the seasons highest of 44.9C yesterday, got some relief today with the maximum temperature falling to 41.1 degrees, one degree above normal. The minimum temperature, too, fell from 34C to 31.5C, two degrees above normal.

 With dust storms and thunderstorms predicted in the next couple of days, the weather is expected to be cooler but Met officials offered no hope of a fall in humidity.

 The swelter has made tourists out of Kashmiris who have been flocking to the cooler climes of Gulmarg and prisoners out of jail visitors.

 Some 15 people meeting friends and relatives in Muzaffarnagar district jail, Uttar Pradesh, were left cooling their heels behind bars because intense sweating had washed away the stamp impression on their hands.

 According to the jail manual, visitors hands are stamped to tell them apart from the inmates. The visitors were allowed to leave only after the 5 pm headcount of prisoners.

 Uttar Pradesh has suffered the worst, with 62 deaths including 13 of todays 28. 

 Pakistan has recorded the highest temperature. At 52C, Sibi in Baluchistan just failed to break the national record of 52.2 degrees set in 1992.

 In Srinagar, the mercury outjumped the normal by 6.5 degrees to reach 34.5C while Jammu, after yesterdays scorching 46.3C, was breathing slightly easier at four degrees lower.

 Gulmarg has recorded a heavy rush, state tourism director Farooq Ahmad Shah said, with the gondola cable car corporation earning Rs 70 lakh in the last 10 days.

 In his smaller way, Ram Singh in Jaipur, too, did good business. I used to sell 50 to 70 watermelons a day but now I am selling over 100, the vendor said.

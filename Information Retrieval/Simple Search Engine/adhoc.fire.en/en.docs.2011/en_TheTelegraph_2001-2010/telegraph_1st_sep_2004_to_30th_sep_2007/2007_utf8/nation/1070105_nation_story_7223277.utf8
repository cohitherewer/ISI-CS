 BSNL dishes out television option

 Calcutta: If you havent yet taken conditional access system (CAS) or direct-to-home TV, here is another option for you: IPTV or Internet protocol television, offered by BSNL.

 We are investing Rs 30 crore to roll out the service in the city and the target customer base is around 2.25 lakh. Subscribers will get a service which entails the use of existing telephone lines connected with a broadband modem and a small electronic gadget to deliver DVD-quality picture and CD-quality sound, said S.K. Chakraborty, chief general manager, Calcutta Telephones.

 A soft launch is planned for February and the commercial launch is scheduled for April.

 Chakraborty promises IPTV will be much cheaper than the other options for Rs 200 a month, he says, consumers will get all free and pay channels. As for movies on demand, 30 will be free, after which Rs 5 will be charged per film. Private operators charge around Rs 75 per movie.

 BSNL has recently upgraded its broadband service from 256 kbps to 2 mbps, an eight-time increase free for all broadband subscribers, which will allow broadcast of up to 100 channels, Chakraborty said.

 But in Mumbai, where the service is already on offer from MTNL, only about 25-30 channels were offered initially and this was gradually upgraded.

 Other services promised include sports highlights on demand, video conferencing, online training and multiple windows showing simultaneous channels. 

 Games will be available on demand, at Rs 100 for 25 games and Rs 200 for 50 games. 

 The initial installation cost no dish or set-top box is required will be less than that for CAS or DTH, which varies between Rs 3,000 and Rs 6,000, Chakraborty said.

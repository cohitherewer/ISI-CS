 Vanzara arrest hope for living dead

 When police came to his house on Mogul Street in the predominantly Muslim locality of Ahmedabads Kalupur Panch Patti, it wasnt very late.

 I think it was around 10 pm. There were about 10 or 15 of them and they wanted my son, recalls Karimi Mohammed Habeeb. I told them my son went out in the morning and I havent seen him since.

 Habeeb did not know his son had been picked up by the police in the morning. He says the police took him to their establishment in Shahi Baghs bungalow No. 15 and confined him for four days after he signed on two blank sheets.

 Now, nearly four years since that incident and emboldened by the arrest of DIG D.G. Vanzara, Habeeb wants the case against his son re-opened. His son Kalim Ahmed has not been back home since that morning of April 3, 2003. He is in Sabarmati Central Jail.

 The families of the accused in Prevention of Terrorism Act cases in Gujarat are now encouraged to question every action of the state police in court since the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case emerged and Vanzara was arrested.

 Sohrabuddin is dead. But what about us? We are surviving, our sons are in jail but we seem to be forgotten like we are the living dead, says Alina Bibi Alla Rakha of house no. 2202 in Panch Kuan.

 If Vanzara is sent to jail over the fake encounter case, he may be a co-inmate of people he arrested and dealt with sternly, some say brutally. But there is an apprehension among the police that Vanzara should not be sent to the same jail where some of his victims are. He may be sent to a jail in Mehsana because the Intelligence Bureau has also warned of a threat to his life.

 Kalim was charged under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, repealed two years back . He stands accused of planting tiffin bombs in five city buses and also of being involved in killing former Gujarat minister Haren Pandya.

 According to the police, Kalim was arrested in Hyderabad, was linked to a jihadi conspiracy sponsored by Pakistans ISI and even trained in Pakistan for 15 days. But my son keeps telling me that he was picked up in Kalupur, says Habeeb. They have taken a confession from him.

 Lawyer Mukul Sinha, who is also an activist of the Jan Sangharsh Manch, says there is enough reason to doubt the veracity of confessions extracted through third-degree torture and extra-legal methods by Vanzara and his men. 

 He estimates there are 80 youths with anti-terror cases foisted on them in state jails. 

 Alina Bis son, 32-year-old Ahmed Hussain, is a maulana. He was picked up on May 10, 2003, and sent to jail after 41 days in police custody. Those 41 days, says Alina, broke him.

 Mohammed Owais Abdur Rashid Machiswalas is a similar tale. His younger brother, 30-year-old Mohammed Anas, was also picked up on April 3. For three days, he says, my brother was hung upside down and beaten. Anyone will confess to anything after that, he weeps.

 Atals double-edged jab

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Vajpayee

 New Delhi, May 9: Try as they might, the BJPs GeNext leaders can do little to shake off Atal Bihari Vajpayees shadow. 

 Last evening, the former Prime Minister showed just how he could steal the show. It hardly mattered that he stayed away from the limelight while L.K. Advani, Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj toiled in election-bound Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.

 Vajpayees political skills were on display at the BJPs central election committee meeting to finalise candidates for the Goa elections and bypolls to Hamirpur (Himachal Pradesh) and Ullala (Karnataka) Lok Sabha seats.

 Hamirpur is a test case for the BJP as the contest comes months before the Himachal polls next February.

 Prem Kumar Dhumal, who wants to be projected as the chief ministerial candidate, is lobbying to get his son the Hamirpur ticket. The seat fell vacant after BJP MP Suresh Chandel was expelled from Parliament after he was caught taking bribe in a sting operation. 

 It was presumed that Dhumal would persuade the high command to pick his son over two other aspirants former minister Jai Prakash Nadda and Una MLA Satpal Satti.

 As the nominees were discussed, Vajpayee made a proposal get Dhumal, not his son, to contest from Hamirpur.

 The BJP veteran is known to have a fondness for Shanta Kumar, who has a liberal image in the state and is believed to be Vajpayees choice for the post of chief minister.

 Unko (Dhumal) hi ladna chahiye (He alone should contest), he reportedly told stunned leaders. By getting Dhumal to contest a Lok Sabha election, Vajpayee was clearing the way for his favourite to become chief minister.

 No one had the courage to question Vajpayee. After all, he was only speaking in Dhumals favour. Dhumal, who was also present, had little choice but to accept the party decision. If Dhumal wins from Hamirpur, it would not be easy for him to quit the seat so soon and get elected to the Assembly. If he loses, there is absolutely no question of him being projected as chief minister. Both ways, he has been hit, said a BJP leader.

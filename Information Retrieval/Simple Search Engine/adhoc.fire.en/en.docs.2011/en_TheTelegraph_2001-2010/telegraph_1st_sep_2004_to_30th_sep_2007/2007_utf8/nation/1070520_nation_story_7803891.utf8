 Cannes, May 19: Nearly 1,000 invitation cards were sent out for last nights much-anticipated gala India party hosted by the Confederation of Indian Industry on the Hotel Majestic Beach in Cannes but among the most welcome guests was a team of buyers from Pakistan.

 They said restrictions on the import of Indian films into Pakistan were easing slightly and expressed the hope that cinema would help to hasten the political thaw between the two countries.

 Beachside partygoers included actress Preity Zinta, who promotes Chopard jewellery, Pan Nalin, the Paris-based director of Gujarati origin, and Mani Ratnam, whose Guru is due to be shown tomorrow in Cinemas of the World.

 Although such parties are partly social occasions, a lot of business also gets done.

 The Pakistan team of buyers was essentially a family concern HKC Entertainment involving Hammad Chaudhry, his sister Aneela Chaudri and their father Abdul Khaliq Chaudhry. They worked closely with family friends Satish Anand of Everready Pictures who is based in Karachi and a relative, Tanya Anand, who, like Hammad and Aneela, lives in London.

 They are working to ensure that the new Indian films they buy get the same release day in Pakistan as in India.

 Relaxing in the Indian pavilion on the Croisette before the India party, Hammad struck an optimistic note: Things are changing and more and more the law (on Indian cinema imports) is being relaxed.

 He revealed Indian entertainment companies had even offered to build the multiplexes that Pakistan needed. Pakistanis wanted better films, shown in comfortable theatres, while the Indians were keen to add to the sizeable market next door, said Hammad.

 Amit Khanna, chairman of Anil Ambanis Reliance Entertainment who claims he was the first to use the word Bollywood in 1978 or 1979, agreed: Three years ago, a delegation of Pakistani film producers and distributors was in India. On behalf of the film and television producers guild, which represents almost all the major filmmakers from around the country, I signed an MoU with them for bilateral exchange and distribution of films.

 Although the Pakistan film industry was split between film producers who felt threatened at the prospect of enhanced Indian imports, and the distributors and exhibitors who are being wiped out because everyone watches pirated movies, Khanna said: Some amount of interaction has happened. We believe there is an opportunity for a two-way exchange of professionals and artists.

 In fact, Mahesh Bhatt is just releasing a film, Awarapan, which has all its songs sung by Pakistani singers.

 He added: With opening up of trade between the two, I think especially the cultural context has tremendous possibilities, both in terms of commerce, but more in terms of track two diplomacy people to people contact. Cinema is a medium which fosters this.

 Paying her first visit to Cannes, Asha Swarup, secretary, ministry of information and broadcasting her favourite movie is Sound of Music commented that the Indian government wanted further (film) collaboration.

 The government has already started doing such events. Also, we have Pakistani actresses coming and acting in Indian films. Its a wonderful idea. I know Indian cinema is very popular in Pakistan. It would be wonderful to have these exchanges.

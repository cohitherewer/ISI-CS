 Mumbai, Feb. 11: From behind bars, they would carry on their business. Thanks to smuggled cellphones, criminals lodged in Arthur Road Jail had no problem keeping in touch with the outside world. But not any more.

 Yesterday, the prison became the only one in the country to have mobile jammers.

 The high-security jail tops the list of organised crime syndicates that are known to operate from the jail.

 The state-of-the-art mobile jamming system will improve vigilance and security inside the jail, Maharashtra DIG, prisons, D.P. Yadav said. 

 Installed by Delhi-based Netline Technologies, the jammers are part of the jails long-overdue security upgrade. 

 Mobiles have been a menace for the authorities of Arthur Road Jail. Inmates could easily smuggle in cellphones and carry on their criminal operations. 

 In 2005, Mumbai polices crime branch had taped conversations between gangster Chhota Rajan and his aides, including D.K. Rao, who were behind bars. 

 Transcripts were submitted to the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act court, which charged Rao and his associates, Shrikant Sonawne and Hitesh Trivedi, with running an organised crime syndicate from the jail. 

 Yadav said the jamming system will now make it practically impossible for its high-profile inmates to communicate with their associates through cellphones.

 A committee comprising representatives from the prison, Netline, the Mumbai police wireless department and the state department of technology will monitor the efficiency of the system, the DIG added. 

 When the jails mobile jammers were activated yesterday, it marked the end of three years of discussions. 

 In June 2004, then minister of state for home Kripashankar Singh had announced that Arthur Road Jail would have a mobile jamming facility, but the plan gathered dust. 

 In February last year, jammers were installed on a trial basis to monitor wireless signals within the high-security anda cell (a special cell where high-profile inmates are housed). 

 But since the company that installed the system could not guarantee 100 per cent efficiency, it was discontinued.

 The DIG said he is confident that the new jamming system will deliver.

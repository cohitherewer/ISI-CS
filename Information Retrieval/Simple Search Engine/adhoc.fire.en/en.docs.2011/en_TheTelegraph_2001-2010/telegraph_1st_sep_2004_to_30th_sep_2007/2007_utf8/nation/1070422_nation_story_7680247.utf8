 Hyderabad, April 21: A student of an engineering college in Hyderabad was shot at today allegedly by his senior in what police say could be the fallout of a gang war.

 Second-year student Mohammed Mukarram Ali Siddiqui received bullet injuries in his lower back and legs when Umedullah Khan allegedly fired six rounds at him. Four others were also injured. 

 Both Mukarram and Umedullah have been expelled. 

 The police say the two are well-known rivals and have clashed often outside the Deccan Engineering College. On campus, too, they have been at each other over ragging incidents. The police suspect that it was one such instance that triggered todays attack.

 Some months ago, Umedullah whose gang is known to harass freshers had been suspended reportedly after Mukarram complained about him to the college authorities. Since then, Umedullah had been nursing a grudge and was waiting for the time when he could take revenge.

 Today, as Mukarram was waiting near the college office to collect his hall ticket, Umedullah attacked him. Students and staff watched in disbelief as the third-year student pulled out his .32 revolver and fired at a stunned Mukarram. 

 He was immediately taken to a hospital in Banjara Hills where he has been operated on. All the bullets except one in his spinal cord have been removed.

 Police commissioner Balwinder Singh said college rivalry had led to the incident and investigations are under way. Umedullah has been arrested along with three of his associates and taken to Habibnagar police station for questioning. 

 The son of a local businessman, Umedullah had been arrested earlier, also in connection with a ragging case. The police said he was carrying a licensed gun belonging to his father.

 The incident occurred inside the Dar-us-Salaam complex, which houses the headquarters of the Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen. The land on which the college is built also belongs to the party.

 Student gang wars, the police said, were becoming a common feature in Hyderabads educational institutions where the unions are split between the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad and the Students Federation of India. 

 The Islamic Students Union is a new entrant in the citys college politics, already ridden with Naxalite groups.

 Security has been tightened at other institutions.

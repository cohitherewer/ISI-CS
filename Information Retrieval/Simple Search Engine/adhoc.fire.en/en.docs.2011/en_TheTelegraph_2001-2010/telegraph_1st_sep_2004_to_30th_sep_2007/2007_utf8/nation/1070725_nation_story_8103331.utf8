 Modi rebel list grows

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, July 24: The BJPs crackdown on dissidence in Gujarat was greeted with derision today as two more MLAs joined the rebel camp.

 Undeterred by the suspension of five MLAs, Gopal Dhua and Narendrasinh Jadeja turned up at a farmers meet in Junagadh in an unconcealed show of defiance. 

 The meeting was organised by the suspended MLAs who have been holding similar sessions in different parts of the state to mobilise farmers, mostly Patels, against chief minister Narendra Modi.

 The five MLAs who were suspended yesterday are all Leuva Patels, the influential community which looks up to the dissidents mentor and former chief minister, Keshubhai Patel, as their leader. 

 The suspended MLAs were felicitated for the fight against the autocratic chief minister. The Visavadar constituency, which covers the venue of the meeting, was represented by Keshubhai.

 While the dissidents were marshalling forces there, Keshubhai, who turned 77 today, played host to a large number of supporters in Gandhinagar.

 Despite facing dissidence in an election year, Modi took time off to greet his predecessor and arch rival but refused to speak to journalists.

 Monica says sorry to country

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhopal, March 30: Two days after Monica Bedi stunned a Bhopal court when she fainted, the actress today released a letter alleging she was fram-ed in the fake passport case.

 In an appeal to the media, Monica insisted she was innocent. I want to get bail, get back to work and re-establish my name in the Hindi film industry. I apologise to my countrymen for causing distress and seek pardon, she said, asserting she has never betrayed national interest.

 Monica said she did not indulge in forgery. Everyone knows during the said period between March-July 2001, I was in Dubai. How can I sign a passport form in Bhopal?

 Gangster Abu Salems girlfriend, Monica said: I have immigration record from Dubai but here police is not taking cognisance of it.

 Turning her ire at police approver Siraj, she asked how the prosecution made her an accused while bailing out the person who forged her signature. I have become a pawn in the big games and rivalry between Abu Salem and Siraj.

 Monica said she wanted to talk to the media but could not, fearing it would focus on her personal life. Now I have realised that media alone can communicate my sentiments to my countrymen.

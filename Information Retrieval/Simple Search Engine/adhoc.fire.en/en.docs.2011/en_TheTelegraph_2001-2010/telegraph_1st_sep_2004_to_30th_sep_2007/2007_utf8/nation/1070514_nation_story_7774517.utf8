 Singing with Sachin, howzat!

 Asha, Sachin: Can he sing? 

 New Delhi, May 13 (PTI): Sachin Tendulkar can add another feather in his cap with legendary singer Asha Bhonsle expressing her wish to sing a duet with the Little Master.

 Asha, who has been singing with celebrities from different walks of life for the album Asha and Friends, said Tendulkar would be the one Indian cricketer she would like to sing with. She has already sung with Australian cricketer Brett Lee.

 I would love to sing with Sachin Tendulkar but I dont know whether he sings. Ive never asked him about it, Asha said. 

 I have heard that Sanjay Manjrekar is a good singer. I knew his father very well, too, said the singer, whose career spans over six decades.

 While Australian cricketers are generally perceived as arrogant, the singer, who is in her seventies, lavished praise on Lee for his good behaviour during the shooting of their album.

 Brett Lee is a very sweet boy. He has so much respect for elders and that was evident. He was calm, cool and composed as he had come to shoot the video a day before the final of the Champions Trophy, said Asha, who has sung over 12,000 songs in 14 languages, including English, Russian, Nepali and Malay.

 Asha was also impressed with Lees music sense, which helped them complete the video quickly.

 Brett Lee proved not just a great singer but a terrific actor, too. He performed very naturally in the video as well.

 I watch a lot of cricket and knew him from before and that sort of helped a lot for the video to be wrapped up in three hours. He was also giving his takes quickly, she said. He wanted to have more of my music. So I presented him with 10 CDs of my work and he was thrilled.

 Asha said she watched cricket whenever possible. I like to watch cricket as long as my schedule permits me to.

 Protester Uma says it with tomatoes 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Indore, Sept. 16: Tomatoes have always been a handy weapon of protest but Uma Bharti today gave the tradition a swadeshi tweak.

 The sadhvi turned into a sabziwali bai (woman vegetable seller), carrying a basket of fresh tomatoes on her head in protest against the entry of big private capital in fruit and vegetable retail.

 She turned up at a Reliance Fresh outlet at the head of 50 party supporters and, watched by a curious crowd of about 1,200, locked the already locked store.

 Reliance had closed the outlet located in Indores busy Zanjeerwala area for a day to avoid trouble after Uma announced her protest in advance. Officials said Umas locks would be removed tomorrow.

 Addressing workers of her Bhartiya Janshakti Party, Uma said companies like Reliance Fresh would hit poor vegetable and fruit sellers in the stomach. She did not try to sell any of the tomatoes, though., and left with the basket full.

 Yesterday, Uma had threatened that if Wal-Mart opened a store in the state, she would set it on fire.

 Reliance Fresh outlets in Madhya Pradesh had witnessed feeble opposition from the ruling BJP, too, but it ebbed after a meeting between chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Mukesh Ambani.

 The state BJP has organised a meeting in the hill resort of Pachmarhi later this month to take a holistic view of the matter. Many BJP leaders, including cabinet ministers, are backing Reliance but the partys trader wing continues to oppose it.

 Uma took pains to clarify that she was not against Reliance but its entry into the retail sector. 

 Reliance has eight stores in Indore and six in Bhopal. It plans to open another 24 stores in the state.

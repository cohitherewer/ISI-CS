 Whiff of pension pact between govt amp; Left 

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, May 21: The Centre does not seem overly concerned at the tone of the Left over the pension bill and is prepared to ride out the storm generated by a letter sent to the Prime Minister.

 Left leaders like Prakash Karat and A.B. Bardhan had sent the letter, almost as soon as Parliament was adjourned, saying they would oppose the move to set up the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority.

 However, the timing of the letter has fuelled speculation of an unspoken agreement between the Centre and the Left that the bill would not be brought before Parliament but the measure would come into effect through an order issued by the government.

 Left leaders seem to have told the Centre that if the bill were to be tabled, they would have no option but to oppose it. On the other hand, if the Centre issued an order, it could go ahead with the move, despite outward protests by the Left, government sources said.

 The finance ministry clarified today that it had decided to restrict the management of the new pension fund to public sector entities, keeping out foreign and domestic private companies.

 The clarification meets a Left demand. But the ministry has left some room for foreign investment, which the Left has been opposing.

 The finance ministry said direct or indirect foreign investment in the pension fund manager, if any, shall not exceed 26 per cent of its paid-up share capital. This is in accordance with the report of the standing committee on finance, which examined the bill.

 The ministry said it has set May 25 as the deadline for expressions of interest for the appointment of pension fund managers. Only government entities like central government companies and public financial institutions, in which not less than 51 per cent paid-up capital is held by the central government or partly by the central government and partly by one or more state governments, can apply. 

 According to the statement, the selected entity would be required to incorporate the pension fund manager as a separate public sector company. Both the sponsor as well as the pension fund manager would, therefore, be in the public sector. 

 Further, to be eligible, the sponsors must have at least five years experience of fund management, and average assets under management of the sponsors must not be less than Rs 10,000 crore for March 2007. Thus, even among public sector entities, only those with sufficient experience and financial strength can apply, the ministry said. 

 At the outset, the Left parties were totally opposed to the pension bill. However, some accommodative spirit was shown when Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wrote to his party high command some months ago, requesting a rethink.

 The chief minister pointed out that the bill would significantly reduce the financial burden on the state. The CPM then climbed down from its non-negotiable position to one where it was willing to negotiate the bill with the government. 

 But the CPM had not reckoned with the Left trade unions, both Citu and Aituc, who teamed up and insisted that the bill, in its very essence, was unacceptable. The Left parties knew that if it came to the crunch, they would not be able to support the bill on the floor of the House.

 Rahul lands, Sharad sulks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 17: Rahul Gandhi is zipping across Uttar Pradesh at the cost of others. Or so Janata Dal (United) president Sharad Yadav believes.

 A livid Sharad Yadav complained against Rahul to chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswamy this evening.

 The complaint filed on his behalf by JD (U) secretary K. C. Tyagi and BJP spokesperson Prakash Javdekar says the state administration is discriminating against campaigners of other parties while giving Rahul special treatment.

 To prove its allegation, the JD (U) recalled an incident in Badaun on April 14. Sharad Yadav was to address a rally during the day. He sought clearance for his helicopter to land on the police lines ground, the towns only helipad. But when he flew in, he was told he cant land because Rahuls helicopter had arrived. Yadav had to hover for a while before his pilot touched down on a nearby field.

 Preferential treatment to Rahul, according to the JD (U) complaint, extended not just to the landing priority, but to security arrangements as well. His (Sharad Yadavs) helicopter landed at a vacant spot and even there, no arrangements were made for security. Rahuls helicopter was allowed to land with all security. The attitude is beyond comprehension, the complaint says.

 The election commissioner was told why Sharad Yadavs wasnt any less important as a VIP than Rahul when it came to security. The district administration forgot that Yadav has been a member of Parliament for the last 30 years and is the president of a national party, while Rahul Gandhi is a first-time MP, the complaint said.

 JD (U) candidates are pitted against mafia candidates, which makes it important for Sharad Yadav to have enough security, the complaint said. It even cited Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav as a threat. 

 Our candidates are fighting mafia candidates like D.P. Yadav in Sahaswan and Mukhtar Ansari in Mau. A JD (U) candidate is also contesting against Mulayam Singh Yadav in Gunnaur. Even against such a background, Sharad Yadav hasnt been given adequate security cover.

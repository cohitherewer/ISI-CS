 Dera sorry

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, June 20: Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh today apologised again for hurting Sikh sentiment, hours after a Bhatinda court issued an arrest warrant against him.

 The unsigned letter was sent to the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, its president Paramjit Singh Sarna claimed. The apology has been made to Guru Gobind Singh and the Sikh community.

 The warrant was issued after a case was filed by the Punjab government against Gurmeet on May 20. A Dera advertisement had portrayed him in clothes that made him resemble Guru Gobind Singh, that sparked clashes.

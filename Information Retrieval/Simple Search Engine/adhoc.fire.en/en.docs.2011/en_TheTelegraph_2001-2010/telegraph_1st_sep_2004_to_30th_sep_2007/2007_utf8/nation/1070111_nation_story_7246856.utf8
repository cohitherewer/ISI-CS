 Murder cloud on pullout

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ajit Singh

 Lucknow, Jan. 10: Few believed Ajit Singh when he said he was walking out on Mulayam Singh Yadav over sugarcane prices.

 The resignation of two Rashtriya Lok Dal leaders, one of them a minister, in the Kavita Chaudhary murder case had driven a wedge between the partners. But the controversy weakened Ajit Singhs claim over poll seats.

 The Samajwadi Party was apparently trying to use the murder against its alliance partner, asking RLD to accept fewer seats as part of a pre-poll adjustment. Ajit Singh had asked for 84 seats, including 51 from western Uttar Pradesh, but he was told to be satisfied with 55 seats 40 in its stronghold of the west and 15 elsewhere.

 Mulayam felt RLD had accepted the deal in principle. All that was needed was a formal agreement to seal it. He (Ajit Singh) was in touch with Amar Singh. Seat adjustments were going to be finalised soon, but something went wrong, Mulayam said this morning. 

 What the chief minister didnt say, perhaps, killed the alliance. Mulayam got feelers that Ajit Singh was ready to accept what hed offered him. But that was before December 25, when the lid was blown off the Kavita murder.

 Ever since, the Samajwadi Party leaders sniffed an advantage. They sent proposals offering Ajit Singh 45 seats, 10 less than it initially planned. Mulayams party claimed it had to reduce the number of seats to pacify its western Uttar Pradesh leaders. They were angry at being squeezed out of the fray by RLD aspirants, the SP said.

 Ajit Singh had other problems, too. His minister, Chaudhary Babulal, had resigned over the Kavita case. So had former minister Merazuddin Ahmed. But Samajwadi Party minister Kiran Pal Singh, whose name also figured in the case, continued in the government.

 RLD leaders then asked for a meeting with Mulayam. They cited sugarcane prices as the reason, but signalled they would also like the Kavita murder case discussed. The chief minister turned down the request. Then, he went on to announce a CBI probe into the case. 

 On Tuesday however, the chief minister claimed he was interested in talks, but Ajit Singh said he was busy.

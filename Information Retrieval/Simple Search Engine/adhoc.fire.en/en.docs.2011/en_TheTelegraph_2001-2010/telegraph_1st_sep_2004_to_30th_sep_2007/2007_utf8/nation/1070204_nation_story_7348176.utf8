 Left sermon for Sonia

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 Bardhan, Karat 

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: Left parties have asked Sonia Gandhi not to be complacent and to take serious note of the Shiv Sena-BJP combines victory in the Maharashtra civic polls.

 CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan, who met the Congress chief, also voiced concern over the increase in communal violence in Uttar Pradesh.

 Sonia had blamed the Congresss ruling partner NCP for the Maharashtra defeat and told Bardhan that the Sharad Pawar-led party made unrealistic demands and left no scope for any arrangement. She gave her party a clean chit, saying the NCP had fought the Congress in each seat and ensured the Sena-BJPs win.

 So when Bardhan asked if the pattern in the civic polls could repeat itself in the Assembly elections, the Congress president seemed worried but ruled out a recurrence of what had happened.

 The CPI general secretary, who is known to be close to Pawar, shared Sonias view that the NCP had overplayed its hand in the municipal polls.

 Bardhans CPM counterpart Prakash Karat has also voiced concern over the development. 

 In an article in the latest issue of the CPM mouthpiece Peoples Democracy, he says: An unfortunate feature of the situation is the failure of the secular parties to be conscious of the (communal) danger.

 Karat goes on to say that in Uttar Pradesh, where elections would be held soon, secular parties are at loggerheads with each other, which boosts the BJP and the RSS. 

 In UP, the Samajwadi Party, the Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party are engaged in mutual recriminations with none of them targeting the BJP which is the main culprit, he says.

 Relations between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party have always been bitter as both eye the same vote bank. Karat indicates that the ruling Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh should act with more resolve against the BJP, which organised protests following party MP Adityanaths arrest in Gorakhpur.

 The Mulayam Singh government has to take firm action against the Hindu Vahini and other communal elements which are stoking up tensions and violence, Karat says. 

 The tone and tenor of Karats article and Bardhans meeting with Sonia suggest that the Left, which supports the Congress-led UPA at the Centre to keep the BJP out, will now mount pressure on the government to go all out to check communal forces.

 The BJP is seeking to rally its hardcore Hindutva constituency and create communal polarisation, keeping in mind the proximity of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections and the fact that in the coming period, elections will be held in Gujarat and in the BJP-ruled states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Karat says.

 Plaque rebuff to 1857 team 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Sept. 21: A Meerut church has turned down the request of a group of British soldiers families to install a plaque in memory of their forefathers killed during the 1857 uprising.

 The group of 19, in Meerut for a tour of historical spots associated with the first war of Independence, yesterday urged St Johns Church authorities to put up a plaque on its premises to commemorate the bravery and distinguished service of the fallen soldiers.

 Father Peter Baldev, however, put them off saying such a move could hurt local sentiment and provoke a backlash.

 The plaque used words like bravery and distinguished service of the 1st battalion of the Kings Royal Rifle Corps. We thought this would offend the sentiment of the locals and provoke reprisals. So we refused to install this on the church premises, he said.

 The mutiny tourists, comprising descendants of seven officers who served in the then royal rifle corps, first visited a cemetery in the cantonment area housing the graves of the soldiers. Next, they went to the army museum and looked around at pictures of the uprising. In the afternoon, they went to the church and sprang the plaque request. 

 Baldev said the plaque they wanted installed had the names of some soldiers and the following inscription: To commemorate the 150th anniversary of the bravery and distinguished service of the 1st battalion, the 60th, the Kings Royal Rifle Corps at Meerut and Delhi between 10th May and 20th September 1857 presented by their successor regiment, the rifles, September 2007.

 Although mutiny tourism has been in the news for a while, the administration of Meerut, 350km from Lucknow, said it had no idea of such trips.

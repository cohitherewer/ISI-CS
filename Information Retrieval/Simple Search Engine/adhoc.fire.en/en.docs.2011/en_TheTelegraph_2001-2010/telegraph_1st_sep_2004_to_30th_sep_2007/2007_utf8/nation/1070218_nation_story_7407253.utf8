 Pact push to Ketan film

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: A planned Ketan Mehta film could benefit from an agreement signed between India and Germany last evening.

 Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier signed the agreement on audio-visual co-production in Berlin.

 The agreement allows jointly produced films to benefit from subsidies and tax relief offered to the movie business in both countries. So the co-produced movie will be treated like a German movie in Germany and an Indian movie in India.

 And the agreement would cut some of the red tape involved in shooting in both countries.

 Mehta, who has made Mangal Pandey, Mirch Masala and Maya Memsaab, is reportedly working now on an Indo-German-French co-production based on the life of the 19th century painter Raja Ravi Varma. On the face of it, the movie fits the bill as a possible candidate for benefits under the agreement.

 Britain and Italy are among the countries with which India has signed film co-production agreements in recent years. The treaty with France is about two decades old. An agreement with Canada is being negotiated.

 Apart from movies, the agreement applies to documentary and animation films as well as the music industry.

 A joint commission made up of representatives from the government and entertainment industry from both countries will keep tabs on the implementation of the treaty.

 To seek co-production status for their movies, film-makers need to apply simultaneously to authorities in both countries a month before they begin shooting with a copy of an agreement between co-producers on sharing of revenue or markets.

 For a film to qualify as a co-production, it must have the stamp of both countries in terms of leading or supporting actors, or technical people or financial investment. The original soundtrack of the movie can be in German or an Indian language or English or a combination of them.

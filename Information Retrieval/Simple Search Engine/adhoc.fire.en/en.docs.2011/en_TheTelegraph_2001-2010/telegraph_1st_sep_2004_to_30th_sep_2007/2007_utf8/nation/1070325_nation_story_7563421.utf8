The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cup Backlash 

 Mock rites

 Varanasi: After the defeat, the funeral.

 Angry supporters took out a mock funeral procession in this temple town as they mourned the demise of Indian cricket.

 The fans marched through the streets before immersing the mortal remains in the Ganga. In between, they screamed slogans against the players for their spineless performance. 

 Last rites were performed in Delhi, too, but before TV cameras. The fans came, carrying an effigy of Rahul Dravid, to Jantar Mantar, a favourite spot for those who want to voice their discontent. The protesters left soon after their agony was captured on lens.

 Many of these protests are just to attract media attention, said a policeman. Once photographs are clicked, they go away. 

 In Ahmedabad, a group of young men slapped posters of their fallen heroes.

 ZKs stoned

 Pune: So what if Zaheer Khan took two wickets? He should have scored with the bat, too.

 That seemed to be the message from supporters in this western city who gave vent to their fury by hurling stones at a restaurant the pace spearhead owns. 

 Police said unidentified men threw stones at ZKs, a popular eatery, soon after India lost. There were no major damages. Only a few glass panes were broken, police sources said, adding that security has been tightened in the area.

 Zaheers brother Anish, who looks after the restaurant, however, denied that the joint was attacked.

 Killer shock

 Hyderabad: Cricket fans of a suburb in this old city burnt effigies of the players after a 32-year-old cable TV operator died of heart attack. 

 We had organised a biryani feast and distribution of gifts to all in the colony to mark Indias victory, said Sitaram, a relative of P. Raju, who couldnt bear the shock of Indias virtual exit. But our team poured water on our hopes.

 In Vijayawada, fans disfigured posters of players. In Tirupati, there were no takers for the special laddoo brought from the Balaji temple. Not even for free. In Visakhapatnam, organisers cancelled a cultural programme after the sponsors backed out.

 Who is to blame for Indias defeat? Indira Gandhi, of course. While the rest of the country seethed, some fans didnt lose their sense of humour as they exchanged SMS jokes. What was the most inexplicable defeat for India in the Cup? The loss to Bangladesh, definitely. So, who is responsible? The former Prime Minister: she created Bangladesh, didnt she? Its not known yet if Irish supporters are thanking Mohammed Ali Jinnah.

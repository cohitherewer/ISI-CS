 Enough is enough, says Kalam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 23: A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has had enough of the slanging match.

 The peoples President has opted out of the race for a second term, saying he doesnt want to damage the name of Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 Rashtrapati Bhavan has become a peoples bhavan today, he told journalists, reflecting on his five-year term that ends on July 24. I believe it should be an example for the nation. It should not get degenerated. That is why I said enough is enough.

 It is not a political process when we elect a President, he added. I do not want to become party to a political process. I do not want to damage the name of Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 The Presidents uneasy relation with the ruling combine became public when three ministers openly advised him to stay away from the race. Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar even declared that the match is over for Kalam.

 Kalam admitted that it has not been a smooth run as he took some hard decisions and claimed that returning the controversial office of profit bill was the toughest. It was the first time that a President had returned a bill after it was passed in Parliament.

 The President, however, said he had normal relations with the two Prime Ministers he has worked with. Each had a core competence. One is decision-making process and another is expertise. Sometimes, one person will have decision-making capability and another expertise. A combination will be fantastic, he said.

 On his plans after retirement, he said he would do what he loves most teaching. 

 How would he like to be remembered? As a peoples President, he replied.

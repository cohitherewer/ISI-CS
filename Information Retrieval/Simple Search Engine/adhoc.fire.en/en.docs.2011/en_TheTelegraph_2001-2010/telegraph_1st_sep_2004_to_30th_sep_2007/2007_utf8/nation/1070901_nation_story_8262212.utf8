 Blast suspect hunt in madarsas

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Aug. 31: Police teams have begun raiding madarsas in the dead of night in their search for suspects involved in the Lumbini Park blasts.

 Since the Saturday strike that killed nine persons, at least 10 madarsas have been raided, including the Jamia Islamia Darul Uloom in Shivrampalli and the Jami Anwar-ul Huda in Kishanbagh.

 The madarsas have been asked to provide information on their students and teachers and disclose the source of their funds. The police mounted the raids claiming they were hunting for one Mujibur Rahman.

 Based on information gathered during the raids, the police have taken one Mohammed Shadab, 26, into custody.

 Shadab was picked up from his home in Saleemnagar Colony in suburban Malakpet on Thursday night. He is apparently in touch with the Saudi Arabia-based Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami chief, Shaheed Bilal, believed to be the brain behind the blasts.

 It appears Shadab has been communicating regularly with Bilal, mostly through email and online chat, a police officer who questioned him said.

 Shadab is also believed to have provided shelter to several operatives sent by Bilal to Hyderabad in the past two years. He gave them clothes and bought their tickets, the officer said.

 The police suspect he could have organised the mobile SIM cards and batteries used in the May Mecca Masjid blasts.

 The Muslim clergy is furious that the police have zeroed in on the madarsas. The Deeni Madarsa Board, which oversees the activities of all madarsas in Andhra Pradesh, has complained to chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy.

 Why should they raid a madarsa in the dead of night? Why not during the daytime, if their intentions are clean? asked board general secretary Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani.

 Apart from the Shivrampalli and Kishanbagh madarsas, the police also raided the Jamia Ayesha Siddiqa Lil Banat, a religious school for women in Misriganj.

 Madarsas create responsible and God-fearing citizens. No terrorist has ever been rounded up from a madarsa in India, said Maulana Hameeduddin Aquil, who manages the Shivrampalli madarsa.

 Madarsa heads met yesterday to discuss how the police raids had cast a cloud of suspicion on their institutions.

 Hyderabad police commissioner Balwinder Singh said the hunt for suspects had fanned out to district towns like Nalgonda and Nizamabad.

 We are taking precaution to ensure there is no trouble during the Ganesh festival and the military games.

 Special search teams would keep vigil at bus stands, cinemas, hotels, malls and railway stations, he said.

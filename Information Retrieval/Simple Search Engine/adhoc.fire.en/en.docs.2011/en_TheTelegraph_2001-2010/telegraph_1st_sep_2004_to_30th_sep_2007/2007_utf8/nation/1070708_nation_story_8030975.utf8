 Sikri case

 New Delhi, July 7: Recent comments made by the Prime Minister about the case of aggrieved IFS officer Veena Sikri will not affect the Central Information Commissions future course in the matter, CIC chief Wajahat Habibullah has said.

 We will continue on our course as before. If the matter (related to Manmohan Singhs comments) is presented legally before us, we will then consider it, Habibullah told The Telegraph today. 

 The CIC, however, clarified that there was no confrontation between the commission and the Prime Ministers Office over the case. 

 Sikri had challenged the appointment of Shiv Shankar Menon as foreign secretary in 2006.

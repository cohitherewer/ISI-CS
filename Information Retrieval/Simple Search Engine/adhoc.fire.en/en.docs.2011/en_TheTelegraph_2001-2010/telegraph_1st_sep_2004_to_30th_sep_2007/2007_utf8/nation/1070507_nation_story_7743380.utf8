 Floating on Narmada: a holy-dip tax

 Bhopal, May 6: Devotees taking a holy dip in the Narmada may now have to pay for it.

 The BJP-backed Hoshangabad Municipal Corporation has proposed a Re-1 tax on pilgrims taking the plunge from the rivers southern bank that passes through the town. 

 This, say corporation officials, will help raise money for Narmada clean-up operations.

 The officials say Rs 5 crore is required, which would be spent over two years.

 The proposal, however, has not gone down well with the political parties. The ruling BJP and the Opposition Congress are determined to block the plan.

 State urban development minister Jayant Malliya said he would see to it that the tax is not imposed. We have other means to raise funds for the rivers upkeep. I would like to spare the faithful, he said.

 The Congress has vowed to launch an agitation if devotees are forced to pay the tax. It will hurt the poor the most. Even Re 1 per bath is too steep, said state Congress spokesman Manak Aggarwal.

 Corporation chief Dr N.K. Pandey, however, claimed most Hoshangabad residents support his move.

 We have mostly Independent but elected councillors and we have given this a lot of thought. The poor shall be exempt, said Pandey, an Independent candidate.

 But the concession is not enough for Prahlad Patel.

 The former BJP leader has threatened to sit on a fast if the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government does not stop the proposal from being implemented.

 Patel a close associate of Uma Bharti said he takes a dip each time he passes by the Narmada. It is my river, my goddess. Who is the municipal authority or the government to come between man and God?

 Narmadaji absolves a person of all his sins, and makes him/her pure, by merely her divine sight, said Patel, adding that the river is older and holier than even the Ganga.

 Patel said he had performed the Narmada parikarma a walk along the banks from the source till the end, a distance of approximately 1,400 km, chanting Har har Narmada maiyya (I bow to you, mother Narmada).

 Suresh Belia, an official in the corporation, justifies the move. 

 For many years, he said, the municipal authority has suffered huge losses spending lakhs on cleaning and maintaining the river that millions of pilgrims visit every year. What is wrong if the affluent sections cough up Re 1?

 Aggarwal argued that the issue is not Re 1 or 50 paise, it is the bankruptcy of ideas. Huge funds are being siphoned off and here we have an authority planning to tax faith. Why can it not spend Rs 5 crore over two years to clean the Narmada?

 Politicians are reacting without having seen the actual proposal, retorts the corporation chief. 

 There are dozens of prominent ghats like Sethani and Bhandra that require huge sums for their annual upkeep. If we charge a token sum like it is done at melas, why should anyone make a fuss?

 He has challenged the Congress and the BJP to go for a referendum in Hoshangabad over the issue.

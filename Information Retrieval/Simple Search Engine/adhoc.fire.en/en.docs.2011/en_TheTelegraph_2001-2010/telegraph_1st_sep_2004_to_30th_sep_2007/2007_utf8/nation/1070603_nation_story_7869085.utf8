 Hercules power signal to Russia

 The Hercules C-130J

 New Delhi, June 2: New Delhi is flexing its financial muscle in the arms market and has stepped up its efforts to buy the Hercules C-130J aircraft from the US at a time when Russia and India are negotiating new terms for old deals.

 With the US Congress this week notifying sale of the Hercules to India, defence ministry and Pentagon officials are intensifying efforts to sew up the contract by July.

 The Hercules deal is being used by India to send a strong message to the Russians. The deal is likely to be worth $1.59 billion, roughly the amount India incurs in annual military purchases from traditional supplier Russia.

 Also, after the Hercules deal is concluded, US hardware equipment will have made their way into all three armed forces since the military-to-military relationship was revived in 2002 after years of sanctions from Washington and doubts over reliability in India.

 In the first of the major deals with the US, India bought AN/TPQ 37 weapon-locating radars from Raytheon for the army. The second has been for the landing platform dock, the USS Trenton, that has been handed over to the Indian Navy and is likely to be commissioned as the INS Jalashva when it steams in next month.

 With the Hercules, the US now gets a toehold in the Indian Air Force inventory.

 The Hercules deal is being worked out by the defence ministry at a time when there is a lot of back-and-forth between New Delhi and Moscow over an older deal for the Sukhoi 30 Mki fighter aircraft. India has negotiated a total of 238 Sukhois from Russia, off-the-shelf and licensed production in the late 1990s that totals more than $8 billion. 

 Earlier this year, the IAF signed a contract for an additional 40 aircraft because Indias own light combat aircraft programme is running way behind schedule.

 The Russians have now demanded about half a billion dollars more for the Sukhois because they say the old prices cannot hold true. India says it has always retained the option for placing additional orders and that Russian supplies of spares are at best intermittent. Last month defence secretary Shekhar Dutt led a team to Moscow. Russia also sent its officials last week.

 Present in class? Thumbs up

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Yes, sir

 Hyderabad, Jan. 1: Ten-year-old Surya Prakash can barely wait to get up from bed and catch the bus to school.

 No, hes is no hurry for his lessons. What has caught little Suryas fancy is the new kiosk his school has installed. He wants to be one of the first students to put his thumb into it and record his attendance.

 Government-run schools across Andhra Pradesh are experimenting with digital attendance recorders to promote punctuality among students and teachers and also to bring down the escalating dropout rate, officials said.

 It is more fun than discipline, said Surya, who studies in a primary school at a slum in Hyderabads Banjara Hills.

 The kiosk has a bi-metric meter, which beeps when the children put their right thumbs into a slot. Not only does it let them enter their classes, it also ensures free lunches.

 The kiosk has a database on all students and it records their attendance and performance levels, said M.N.S.L. Murthy, the head master of Suryas school.

 The kiosks have been set up by a software company, Bodhi Tree Solutions, as a pilot project to monitor attendance patterns in cities and towns. They cost Rs 35 lakh. 

 Ten such kiosks are in place in schools, two of them in Hyderabad.

 Faced with a massive fall in attendance in schools 46 per cent the state authorities decided to go digital to enforce accountability and punctuality.

 The huge dropout rate in government schools causes a wastage of public funds spent on mid-day meal schemes and other utilities, said project director of school education K. Chandra Mouli.

 The problem is more severe in towns and cities as a majority of schoolchildren from impoverished families bunk school and go to work in houses or in eateries and hotels, or as vendors, Chandra Mouli pointed out. 

 If successful, more kiosks will come up in government schools in the cities and the 124 municipal towns across the state, which account for almost 65 per cent of the total dropout rates, he added.

 The government has been spending almost Rs 245 crore on providing mid-day meals to around 75 lakh children to stem dropout rates and also to lure teachers. Nearly 35 per cent of teachers do not go to schools in remote villages, a senior official said.

 The dropout rate is the highest between classes VII and X 55 per cent. Girls of this age-group, particularly, are driven to work by poor families as farm hands or as domestic helps, said state education minister N. Rajyalakshmi.

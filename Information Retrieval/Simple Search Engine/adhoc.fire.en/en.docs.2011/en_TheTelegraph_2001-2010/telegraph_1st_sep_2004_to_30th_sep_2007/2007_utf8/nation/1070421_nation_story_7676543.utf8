 Mumbai, April 20: The family wanted privacy and the guests were guarded. But the media did catch a glimpse of the star-studded ceremonies. Heres a quick look at who was doing what at Bollywoods biggest wedding.

 Abhishek Bachchan: So what if some unknown aspiring actress had accused him of marrying her four months ago? The groom has no room for any other girl now.

 Abhishek, who has been partying hard since sangeet-eve, was having a blast inside Jalsa all day.

 He emerged from the Juhu bungalow in the evening, nephew Agastya giving him company on horseback. The two were busy chatting. Was the Chhota B passing on tips to the Chhota dulha?

 Face covered in a curtain of flowers, Abhishek was dressed in a milk-white Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla sherwani. 

 He got off the horse and stepped into a Volvo bus, which took him to Prateeksha. When it reached the wedding venue, Abhishek came out of the bus in style an impromptu jig took everyone around by surprise. 

 Jumping on to the horse again, the dilwala was ready to take his dulhaniya home.

 Aishwarya Rai: As neighbour Prahlad Kakkar had said, Ash was ecstatic, yet a touch tense during the wedding celebrations. 

 She was picture perfect and a little emotional at the sangeet at Prateeksha. She spent the wedding-eve at her flat in Bandra. But this afternoon onwards, father-in-law Amitabh Bachchans bungalow became Ashs home. 

 Much before Abhishek made his way from Jalsa to Prateeksha, Ash had reached the venue in a Mercedes decorated with red roses and orchids.

 Make-up artist Mickey Contractor soon got to work. In a pink ensemble, again created by Bachchan favourites Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla, Ash looked the quintessential blushing bride.

 Amitabh Bachchan: He might have hundreds at his service, but when it came to his sons big day, Amitabh handled everything on his own.

 If he had stood outside Prateeksha on Wednesday night to receive the Rais for the sangeet, the superstar turned humble father again this evening. 

 He escorted almost all his guests to the buses parked outside Jalsa. 

 At Prateeksha, he guided Abhishek out of the bus and even helped him get on the horse. Wearing a white sherwani and an orange turban, he looked tense.

Jaya Bachchan: The award for dodging the media glare goes to the mother of the groom. She was at Jalsa when everyone thought she had gone to La Mer with the shagun for the mehendi. Only time she was seen was when the baraat left Jalsa.

 Amar Singh: If Jaya hid inside her home, Amar Singh was seen all over. 

 Having called the media intrusive and asking to be left alone, the Samajwadi Party leader would always be the first to come out of the bungalow gates and check security and parking arrangements in full public view. 

 Today, too, he was on the job reaching Prateeksha ahead of the rest of the baraati to make sure everything was in place when they arrived.

Shweta Nanda: The big sister came under the spotlight on mehendi day. She carried the shagun from Jalsa to La Mer along with actress Sonali Bendre, who is married to Abhisheks close friend Goldie Behl.

 Shweta, wearing a silver ghagra choli, also held her brothers horse today as they entered Prateeksha.

Sanjay Dutt: A close friend of Abhishek, Munnabhai was the star baraati. Accompanied by friend Maanyata, Dutt was the first to leave the wedding after blessing the couple.

 Sachin Tendulkar: The day has been tough for Sachin he is not part of the ODI team going to Bangladesh but he showed no signs of strain as he accompanied wife Anjali to the wedding.

 One of the last guests to arrive, they went in after 6.15 pm and must have missed the exchange of garlands.

 Preity Zinta: She is one of the few common links between the AbAsh marriage and the Arun Nayar-Liz Hurley wedding. 

 Draped in a yellow sari and dripping with diamonds, Preity came with boyfriend Ness Wadia. 

 Dimple Kapadia: She was seen leaving the sangeet ceremony with Amar Singh in tow early on Thursday. 

 Today, she was in one of the Prateeksha-bound buses, very much a part of the baraat. 

 Dimple shares a special bond with the Bachchans Jaya is her daughter Rinkes godmother.

 The incident took place on Monday night during a New Years party at the camp of 22 Mechanised Infantry in the Ratnuchak area. 

 Subedar Hari Krishan Panday allegedly opened fire at Om Inder Kumar after the two engaged in a scuffle in the barrack, officials said.

 Officers and jawans who rushed to the spot on hearing the gunshot found Kumar lying dead in a pool of blood. 

 Both Kumar and Panday were from Bihar. Panday has been arrested and a court of inquiry has been ordered into the incident.

 Minister quits over Id insult

 Bangalore: Karnataka Haj minister Zameer Ahmed, who had steered a busload of Janata Dal (Secular) MLAs away from the Congress to help form a coalition with the BJP, has resigned in protest against chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamys absence at Id prayers.

 Ahmed met governor T.N. Chaturvedi at Raj Bhavan on Tuesday and handed him his resignation. He later told reporters that Kumaraswamy had insulted the Muslim community by keeping away from the prayers which he claimed no chief minister had ever done.

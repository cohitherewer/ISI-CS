 Bullet holes in Delhi cops trophy terror catch

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: Two days after Delhi police claimed the prize catch of four Jaish-e-Mohammed militants, the force is struggling to make its story add up. The choice may lie between owning up to lying or to incompetence.

 Officers are showing off bullet-riddled vests before the media as a proof of the forces bravery.

 The holes in the vests are also being held up as evidence of an encounter that the police claim took place on Sunday night near Connaught Place.

 The vests saved us, said head constable Satender Singh, a member of the team that arrested the four men.

 But the same vests are throwing up questions that none in the police, from joint commissioner to head constable, seem able to answer.

 Deputy commissioner (special cell) Alok Kumar today again told The Telegraph that the police had fired about 40 bullets. They fired a similar number, about 40. It was a proper encounter. Thankfully, no one from the police was injured.

 Kumar may thank the bullet-proof vests for that, but he had no explanation why the police had failed to hit their targets even once from the same distance about 30 feet.

 The force claims the four men are trained militants who got off their trains at Old Delhi Station on Sunday evening with a single revolver, six hand grenades, a timer and four detonators.

 We know this because of intelligence inputs about their arrival, joint commissioner Karnal Singh said.

 But why did the trained terrorists not lob the grenades, especially after they ran out of bullets? No answer.

 While grenades and a foreign-made revolver have been on display for the media, the officials seem unsure whether they have any empty magazines to show for their Sunday night adventure.

 A scientist at the Central Forensic Science Laboratory told The Telegraph that firing 40 bullets from the revolver would need at least six magazines. The magazine would need to be changed at least five times.

 Asked why they hadnt pounced on the men while the gun was being reloaded, Kumar and the head constable gave different reasons.

 While the DCP said the police knew they had limited ammunition and were prepared to wait it out, Singh said they couldnt be completely sure the terrorists had only one gun. Our intelligence, of course, had told us they had just one revolver, Singh quickly added.

 But of one thing the police were completely sure that the terrorists wouldnt use the explosives to blow up the trains they had arrived on, as witnessed in Mumbai in 2006.

 Asked whether they had taken a risk with passengers lives by allowing terrorists to carry a gun and explosives on the trains, faces were once again blank.

 In 2002, Delhi police had shot dead two persons they claimed were militants at Delhis Ansal Plaza, only to soon face a barrage of questions they struggled to answer.

 A doctor who claimed he saw the police lead the two men out of a car before shooting them was declared mad by the police.

 If we hit the terrorists, media people complain. If we dont, you complain. What is that you want? asked a visibly hassled Kumar.

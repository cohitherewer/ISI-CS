 Left slams brakes on foreign varsity bill 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 12: The Centre is unlikely to table in the coming session of Parliament a bill that will allow universities abroad to set up campuses in India.

 The Left, whose support is crucial, wants the Congress-led government to first put in place a mechanism to control the fee structure and admission process of Indian offshoots of foreign universities before the Foreign Education Providers (Regulation) Bill becomes a law.

 A bill to regulate unaided private colleges, being drafted by a group of ministers headed by Pranab Mukherjee, will include such a mechanism.

 CPM Rajya Sabha MP Brinda Karat today met Arjun Singh and is learnt to have told the human resource development minister that the foreign university bill should not be tabled before a law is passed on governing unaided private educational institutes.

 Under commerce ministry guidelines applicable since 2003 there is no cap on foreign direct investment in higher education. This means a foreign education provider can pump in the entire investment to set up a campus in India.

 The draft bill on foreign education providers emphasises Indias policy on higher education that it must not be commercialised, and that the profit made must be invested back into the institute. The universities will otherwise be on a par as far as their freedom is concerned with other private varsities in India.

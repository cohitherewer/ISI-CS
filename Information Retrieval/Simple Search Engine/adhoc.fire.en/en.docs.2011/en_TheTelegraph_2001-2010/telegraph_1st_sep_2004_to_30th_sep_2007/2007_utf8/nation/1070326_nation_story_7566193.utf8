 N-talks amid rift within amp; without

 - Foreign, atomic energy officials at odds on extraneous issues in US deal

 BHARAT BHUSHAN 

 Samuel Bodman

 New Delhi, March 25: The next round of talks on the agreement to facilitate Indo-US civilian nuclear cooperation begins tomorrow in a context that does not seem very propitious. 

 They also come in the wake of the US showing complete insensitivity to Indian concerns about not linking extraneous issues to the deal. 

 Last week, US energy secretary Samuel Bodman did just that. He set the scene for the talks on the 123 Agreement (so called because it seeks to amend Section 123 of the US Atomic Energy Act). 

 He suggested that New Delhi desist from the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline as that could help push Iran along the nuclear path. Attempting to push India to follow US policy on Iran was in fact one of the extraneous issues of concern in the Hyde Act, the legislation allows Washington and New Delhi to enter into a bilateral agreement on civil nuclear cooperation. 

 When the 123 Agreement is about to be finalised, this level of lack of understanding of Indias concerns is not a good augury. 

 In addition, since July 18, 2005, when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President George W. Bush released a joint statement signalling civilian nuclear cooperation, Indias negotiating posture has consistently weakened. By contrast, Washington has been able to push its non-proliferation policy goals bolstered by the backing of the US Congress. 

 Indias posture has been largely tactical. The attempt has been to delay the day of reckoning first we waited for the House bill, then the Senate bill, then the reconciled Hyde bill, celebrating at each stage as if our concerns had been more than met and there was a promise of something even better at a later stage. Now the hopes of the Prime Minister meet-ing his assurances to Parliament has been placed on the 123 Agreement and the assurances given to him personally by President Bush, said a strategic affairs expert. 

 Then there are differences between the ministry of external affairs (MEA) and the department of atomic energy as well as between the atomic energy establishment and the chief negoti-ator, according to those following the negotiations closely.

 New Delhi is treating the negotiations for the 123 Agreement as a diplomatic exercise. However, at the core of the agreement are security and energy issues. Giving an excessive role to diplomats may be mistaken when we should be taking the views of the scientists who have spent a lifetime in the nuclear establishment on board, said a nuclear expert. 

 The diplomats have no inside knowledge of our nuclear programme or assets. They do not have knowledge, for example, of our fissile material stock, the number of weapons, whether the nuclear weapons have been mated with missiles or not. They dont know whether we have mastered the technology of using reactor grade fuel for weapons or what our techni-cal capability and gaps are. There is no official knowledge of these issues with the MEA. Then how can negotiations be left to these people alone? he asked.

 The suggestion was that the foreign ministry was at loggerheads with the nuclear establishment. The department of atomic energy is keen that the agreement adhere to the July 18, 2005, and March 2, 2006, texts promi-sing comprehensive nuclear cooperation. 

 However, the Hyde Act does not permit the transfer to India of technology of uranium enrichment, heavy water production and fuel reprocessing. It also does not permit the reprocessing of the spent fuel coming out of imported nuclear reactors.

 The Hyde Act also seeks to convert Indias unila- teral moratorium on nuclear tests into a bilateral commitment. 

 The concern of the department of atomic energy here is that should the need to test arise in future (the US has reserved this right for itself), India would have to return reactors, technology and fuel sourced from the US something virtually impossible to implement.

 The Hyde Act also has provisions for intrusive end-use monitoring, double monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the US and annual congressional reporting. 

 It has been argued by some that the reporting requirements are not binding. However, as a nuclear expert pointed out, they have to be seen as an integrated package aimed at constraining, isolating and degrading Indias strategic nuclear programme.

 He pointed out: If full access to technology is denied, there is an attempt to stop fissile material production and there is annual reporting on our nuclear activities, including strategic ones, then the aim clearly is to progressively degrade our programme. 

 However, most of the concerns of the department of atomic energy have apparently now been included in the Indian draft of the 123 Agreement. 

 The US is believed to be unhappy with it because up to now, it had not confronted the issues raised by the department of atomic energy. 

 The idea is to somehow find language that skirts the real issues a semantic exercise that will mask real differences. But since the draft does contain the department of atomic energys concerns, the MEA boys should not acquiesce under pressure which the Bodman visit points to, said an expert. 

 However, he also felt that this was just hoping against hope. They have pulled out people from Singapore and Washington to negotiate. The same people who weakened our negotiating position are back again. Is this a sign of confidence or lack of it? he asked.

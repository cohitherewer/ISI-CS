 Khundroo (south Kashmir), Aug. 13: The fire in Jammu and Kashmirs biggest ammunition depot is finally under control, and the devastation it has left behind is beginning to uncover.

 On the third day after the incident, the toll has mounted to 17, at least 15 others mostly jawans are missing, several villages have been reduced to rubble and 10 per cent of the armys ammunition stockpile in the Valley has gone up in flames.

 DIG, south Kashmir, H.K. Lohia said 14 bodies, including that of an army major, were found in the camp today. The army yesterday found two bodies in the camp while a woman from a nearby village has died of shrapnel wounds.

 Most of the bodies are of defence fire service personnel and two are of civilians. 

 Lieutenant General H.S. Panag, the armys Northern Command chief, said the fire had swallowed 10 per cent of the ammunition. There were 25 concrete sheds in the depot and the fire started from shed No. 16. It was an accidental fire, he said. 

 It will take us two months to completely clear the area and replenish the stock.

 While the depot is spread over 5sqkm, the actual camp is 225sqkm and runs through several villages. The army has pressed 43 bomb disposal squads to clear the area of the hundreds of unexploded shells that may have landed in the villages. Seventy more teams are being requisitioned from army units outside the state. 

 Panag said the last explosion at the depot was heard at 10.20 this morning, but the army authorities would wait for 48 hours before entering the explosion area.

 The 21 Field Ordinance Depot has eight officers, 25 junior commissioned officers and 190 other personnel.

 With the blaze under control, the army has thrown a tight security ring around the villages near the camp. Police and the army today used teargas shells to disperse families of missing fire service personnel who had forced their way into the camp. 

 When I entered the camp, I found 12 bodies lying inside the gate. One of them is of my brother Pintoo Singh, a fire service official, but I could not recognise him because it was charred beyond recognition. Later, his ID card helped us identify him, said Harjeet Singh, a resident of nearby village. 

 The families have been waiting since morning for information on their missing relatives. My nephew Upinder is just 20 and he is no more. He got a job only eight months ago and now we want his body, said Devinder Singh.

 The army is preventing civilians from going to the villages in the depots vicinity, but some managed to sneak through.

 Abdul Gani Najar, a resident of Sumran village, said he found his house had turned into a pile of debris. Most of the houses in Pahloo, Somran and Nowgam villages have suffered extensive damage. We have also lost our cattle and orchards, Najar said.

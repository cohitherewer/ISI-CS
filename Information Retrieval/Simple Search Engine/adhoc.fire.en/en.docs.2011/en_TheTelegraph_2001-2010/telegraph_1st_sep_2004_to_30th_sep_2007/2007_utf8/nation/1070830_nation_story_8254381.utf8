 Bhopal red carpet for Kapils 

 rebels

 - CM offers stadiums to ICL

 Kapil: More support

 The rebel cricket league has added one more heavyweight to its list of backers.

 Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has offered a red carpet welcome to the breakaway group and said it could use stadiums and other state-owned infrastructure.

 We are ready to extend all help to the ICL. They can avail themselves of our infrastructure and facilities, he told a khel panchayat, a gathering of sportsmen across the state, on Wednesday.

 After all, the ICL is led by Kapil Dev, our hero of World Cup 1983. I will support all sports activities which are aimed at promoting the young and talented.

 The BJP-ruled state has several stadiums and some of them are of international standard.

 Chauhans offer has come at a time when many senior politicians like Congress leader Digvijay Singh, railway minister Lalu Prasad and Bengal sports minister Subhas Chakraborty have extended support to the rebel league.

 Congress MP Jyotiraditya Scindia who heads the state cricket association, affiliated to the official cricket board was not available for comment.

 Neither was Sanjay Jagdale, a former national selector and secretary of the state body.

 Both are firmly with the BCCI.

 Sources in the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA) said Chauhans gesture would intensify the conflict between the BCCI and the ICL.

 In a cricket match, the state government and the MPCA work closely. A one-day international will be played in Gwalior under the BCCI banner in October, but such pronouncements are bound to strain ties, said an office-bearer who did not want to be named.

 He said the new cricket stadium in Indore has been funded by the MPCA and Scindias local area development fund. Certainly, Chauhan would not be able to lease that ground to the ICL.

 Former cricketer Amay Khurasiya, however, welcomed Chauhans statement. Although I am with the BCCI, I welcome the chief ministers remark, the left-hander, who played 12 ODIs, told The Telegraph.

 As a player, I welcome the ICLs league concept as it will offer more opportunities to players. But the ICL should expand and go to the grassroots instead of merely focusing on quick-buck Twenty20.

 While former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu has also spoken in favour of the ICL venture, it is the support of the politicians that has annoyed BCCI president Sharad Pawar.

 The Union minister recently expressed mock amazement over Lalu Prasads support to the ICL. Why does not he ask his son, Tejasvi, who plays for Delhi, to enlist himself with the ICL? he quipped. 

 Pawar has been getting regular missives from one-time political associate Digvijay. In his latest letter, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said if the ICL was an out and out commercial venture, so was the BCCI.

 The letter urged Pawar to do some introspection and reform the cricket board. Hasnt BCCI also become a commercial venture that is earning millions by allowing multinationals to use their logos on players outfit? In fact, it has earned more millions than trophies, Digvijay wrote.

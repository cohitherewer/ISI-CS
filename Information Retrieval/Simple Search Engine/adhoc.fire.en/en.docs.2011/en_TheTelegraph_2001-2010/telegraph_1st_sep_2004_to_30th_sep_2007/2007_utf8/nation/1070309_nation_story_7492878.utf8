 Board blinks in TV battle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 8: To save its $612 million deal with Nimbus, the cricket board today offered to foot the bill for encrypting the signals of the live feed the private broadcaster shares with Doordarshan.

 Encryption, which will prevent the signals being picked up illegally by foreign channels, has been a sticking point between the government and Nimbus, which has exclusive telecast rights to all cricket matches in India till 2010.

 Nimbus, which has no objections to sharing the feed, says it might suffer huge revenue losses because of DDs signals being downloaded in neighbouring countries and the Gulf. 

 But Prasar Bharti, which runs DD, was unwilling to carry out encryption and the row was threatening to put the rights deal in jeopardy.

 Today, at a meeting in Delhi attended by its top officials, the Board of Control for Cricket in India offered to encrypt all the 1,400 DD transmitters.

 We will bear the entire cost. It should not take us more than 15 days to encrypt the transmitters. It will be good for not just cricket but other disciplines too, board vice-president Lalit Modi said.

 It is learnt that Nimbus had threatened to drastically reduce the contract amount if the controversy were not settled.

 The board, which called todays meeting, will forward its proposal to the Centre for approval.

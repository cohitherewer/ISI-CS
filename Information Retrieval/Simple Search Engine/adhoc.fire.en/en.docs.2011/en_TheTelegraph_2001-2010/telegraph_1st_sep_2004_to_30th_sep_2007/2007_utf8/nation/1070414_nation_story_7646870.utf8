 Money fine, not Murthy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, April 13: Infosyss money is music to the markets, but its chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthys words have struck a jarring note in the corridors of power.

 On a day the companys spectacular fourth quarter results powered a 270-point rally on the stock market, Karnataka has ordered a proper police investigation into Murthys explanation why the national anthem was not sung during the Presidents visit to the Infosys campus.

 Infosys today reported a 70 per cent surge in its net profit at Rs 1,144 crore and the sensex soared to 13384.08. 

 A cautious home minister, M.P. Prakash, told the Assembly there was no evidence of insult to the national anthem. But he was quick to condemn Murthys comments. 

 It is an unpardonable offence. There was no need for Murthy to make a statement that the instrumental version of the national anthem had to be played to avoid embarrassment to foreigners.

 The police are probing if the comment amounts to disrespect to the anthem following complaints from a lawyer and a former minister, he said.

 Asked by reporters why the anthem was played and not sung on Sunday, Murthy had said the original idea was to sing. But an electronic tune was played as we have a lot of foreigners. We didnt want them to be embarrassed when they are silent and others are singing. So this was fine.

 When this triggered a furore, Murthy apologised. But that has not stopped the complaints. Former minister H.N. Nanje Gowda today went to Mysore police demanding action. He told reporters the police were trying to close the case without filing an FIR.

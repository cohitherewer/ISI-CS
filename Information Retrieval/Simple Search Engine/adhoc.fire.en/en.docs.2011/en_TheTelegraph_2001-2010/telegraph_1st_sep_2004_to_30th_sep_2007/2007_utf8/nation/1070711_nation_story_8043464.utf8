 New TV tax stares at viewers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 10: The Centre could soon decide on a new television tax to make Prasar Bharati financially more viable, and the axe could land on TV manufacturers, broadcasters or even viewers.

 One proposal doing the rounds is to levy an annual licence of Rs 500 for every colour TV set. For black and white, the charge would be Rs 200. 

 But if the manufacturers are charged, television buyers would probably have to share the burden.

 The licence charge and other proposals are on the government table as part of a financial restructuring plan for Prasar Bharati. A group of ministers will meet tomorrow to discuss this and the TV licence fee could figure in their talks.

 The panel it was formed last year and is headed by home minister Shivraj Patil is studying the options outlined in a report prepared by a team of bureaucrats.

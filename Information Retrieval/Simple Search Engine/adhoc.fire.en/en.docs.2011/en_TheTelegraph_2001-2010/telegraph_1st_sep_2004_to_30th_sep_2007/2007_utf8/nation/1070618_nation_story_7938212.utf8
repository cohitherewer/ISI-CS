 If its passport backlog, it may not be India

 Faster than US: A passport office in India

 Washington, June 17: Adults who have applied for, but not yet received, a passport should present government-issued photo identification and an official proof of application at the airport. 

 Children under the age of 16 travelling with their parents or legal guardian will be permitted to travel with the childs proof of application. Travellers who have not applied for a passport should not expect to be accommodated.

 Sounds like India? 

 Which regional passport office has such a huge backlog that overseas travel rules have to be amended to do away with passports at international airport counters?

 No, this is not India, but the United States of America in June 2007.

 It used to take 24 hours to get a US passport. Now, the waiting time is three months, double the average waiting time that passport officials in India claim is the norm for an Indian to get his travel document.

 Maura Harty, the US assistant secretary of state for consular affairs, who announced the rule change in an interview last week, added: In the last few months, we have faced a record-breaking demand for passports as Americans have worked to comply with the law. 

 This increase in requests over and beyond even the enormous demand we anticipated has resulted in longer than expected processing times for passport applications. We recognise that this has caused hardship for some Americans.

 Hardship is an understatement. 

 Newspapers and travel blogs in the US are full of stories about ruined honeymoons, upset travel plans and accounts of horror from the endless wait at 14 US passport agencies. 

 Being a free market even in matters of state, the government introduced provision for expedited passport service that cuts waiting time to two or three weeks for those who cough up $60 in addition to the regular fee.

 But a typical case is that of Joyce Martin of Charlotte, Virginia, reported in the local media.

 Joyce and her husband Neil applied for expedited service and paid the extra $60 six weeks ago. With only four days left for their holiday in Paris, the Martins left their home in Charlotte in the middle of the night to drive to the passport office in Washington and await their turn.

 On Friday, the government announced that those who paid the extra $60 and did not get expedited service are entitled to a refund.

 In the continuing efforts against terrorist threats to the US, the state department and the department of homeland security created a rule that required American citizens returning by air from Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, the Caribbean, South and central America, to have valid passports. 

 As a result, passport applications surged by 33 per cent, officials said. In one month, in March this year, 2 million new passports were issued.

 But despite creating night and weekend shifts, the state department has been unable to cope with the demand.

 Helplines were initially set up for those travelling within 14 days, but applicants found it was virtually impossible to get through on telephone.

 On Friday, the House of Representatives decided to postpone another requirement that passports would have to be presented for land and sea travel to Canada, Mexico, Bermuda and the Caribbean. 

 The Senate, too, agreed that this rule would now take effect only in June 2009. By that time, the state department will hopefully have cleared the backlog of passport applications.

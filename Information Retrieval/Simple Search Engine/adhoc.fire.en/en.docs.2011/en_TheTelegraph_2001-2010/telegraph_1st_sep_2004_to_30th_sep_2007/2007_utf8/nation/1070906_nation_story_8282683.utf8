 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 The bubbly flows for an hour more

 Those out at bars and pubs in Delhi may soon receive an extra hour. 

 The government plans to relax the midnight deadline for closure of bars and pubs by an hour to 1am, after requests from restaurant owners. 

 Its a big relief if the government gives us an hour more to serve liquor, Ranjit Kumar, a bar owner in Saket, said. 

 Owners have long complained that the midnight diktat was too unrealistic. Their arguments, of course, are couched in their concern for customers. 

 People are working longer hours than earlier. By the time most parties start, its midnight. The new rule will definitely help, Muzammil Rizvi, manager at south Delhis Watering Hole, said. 

 A pub like his, Rizvi said, earns between Rs 30,000 and Rs 40,000 between 11pm and midnight. 

 The earnings between midnight and 1am will be similar. Restaurants that serve liquor benefit doubly. New customers dont come after midnight since the liquor is over. Our profits will increase by at least Rs 60,000 daily, the owner of a popular restaurant said.

 Power bonus for homes

 Ten years ago, the Congress had waged a struggle against costlier power. Now, the partys government has decided to gift households a package that could cut tariffs.

 The surcharge and penal interest on power bills of the domestic consumers will be scrapped, a bonus the Y.S.R. Reddy regime hopes will endear itself to people. Polls in the state are two years away, but the drill has begun.

 The penal interest and surcharge, which sometimes amounts to a quarter of the total bill, were imposed as part of the reforms in the power sector under the Desam regime.

 According to energy minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir, the common people will not have to pay these charges any more. In 1997, the Congress had teamed up with the Left parties to launch an agitation against a steep hike in tariffs.

 Cash robe for deity

 Pujas are big in Bengal. But Tamil Nadu could give the deity in the eastern state a run for her money, literally so.

 The goddess in the Karur temple was recently draped in wads of cash, mostly notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, instead of the traditional silk attire she is normally wrapped in. Even the elephants that flank Vembu Mariamman, the deity, were showered with the same affection.

 Karur, like the more well-known Tirupur, is home to large clusters of textile units but the unusual temple offering shows the town is willing to think way above clothes when it comes to earning the blessings of the goddess.

 Lavishing cash at the altar is not entirely unique. In north India, money is often offered to the deity during Lakshmi puja. But in Karur, where the flourishing textile industry has brought prosperity to many homes, it was interesting to see devotees express divine gratitude in a way the town has not quite seen in many years.

 IT remedy

 Getting a birth certificate at one of Delhis slothful government hospitals might not be the pain it has been all these years for most of the residents.

 Chief minister Sheila Dikshit has announced a plan to digitally record all hospital data, paving way for computerisation in a way that benefits the common man.

 A pilot project, which will be called the hospital information management system, will be undertaken at a city hospital, Dikshit said after a meeting last week on problems plaguing government-managed health centres.

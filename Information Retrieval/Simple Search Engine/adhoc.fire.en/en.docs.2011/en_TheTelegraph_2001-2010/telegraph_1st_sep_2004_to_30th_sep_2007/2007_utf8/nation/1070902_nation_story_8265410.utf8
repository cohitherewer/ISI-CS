 Privilege heat on Ronen

 JYOTI MALHOTRA 

 Ronen Sen

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: Indias ambassador to the US, Ronen Sen, may find himself in a thicker soup than he anticipated over his headless chicken remarks, with Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee referring the matter to the privileges committee of Parliament yesterday.

 This is the first time that an Indian ambassador whether career diplomat or political appointee has become a subject of interest for the privileges committee, which is tasked with maintaining decorum and propriety of all members of Parliament. 

 In the middle of the stormy debate sparked off by the civilian nuclear deal, ambassador Sen had been quoted as saying in an interview: Why do you have all this running around like headless chicken, looking for a comment here or comment there, and these little storms in a tea cup.

 As Parliament erupted in dismay, Sen offered an unqualified apology for his tactless remarks, saying he had never referred to MPs, but to his media friends.

 But parliamentarians across the ideological divide, BJP MP Vijay Kumar Malhotra and CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta, were unmoved, moving privilege notices against Sen last week.

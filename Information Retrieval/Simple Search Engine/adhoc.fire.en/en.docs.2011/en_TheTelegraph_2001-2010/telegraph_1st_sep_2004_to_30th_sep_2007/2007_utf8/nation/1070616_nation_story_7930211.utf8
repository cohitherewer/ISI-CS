 Murder in full public glare

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, June 15: Suspected Jharkhand Party (Naren) activists today dragged a CPM worker out of a bus and shot him before passengers who remained mute witnesses.

 Sheikh Siddiqui, 25, was killed at Kapasita village in West Midnapores Jamboni, about 180 km from Calcutta.

 Police said eight assailants boarded the private bus in the guise of passengers when it left the Jamboni block office around 1.30 pm. 

 As soon as the bus neared Kapasita, the armed men pounced on Siddiqui and forced him off the bus. They fired at him with pipe guns and fled to the nearby Kashidanga village.

 When the police went to Kashidanga in search of the killers, they were allegedly attacked by 200 villagers, Jamboni inspector in-charge Pranay Dutta said. Additional police superintendent Bharatlal Meena said two persons have been arrested.

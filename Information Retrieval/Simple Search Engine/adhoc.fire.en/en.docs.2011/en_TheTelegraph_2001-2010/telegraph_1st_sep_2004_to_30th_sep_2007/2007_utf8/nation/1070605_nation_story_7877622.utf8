 Ballot lessons for Baghdad, in Delhi

 New Delhi, June 4: Indias Election Commission has some simple advice for its Iraqi counterpart: stay away from the government as much as possible, assert your independence, and remember, you are responsible only to the people.

 For the last five days, in the anonymity of the Taj Mansingh hotel in the heart of the capital, and amid tight security, Iraqs entire election commission consisting of nine members, two of them women has been attending a workshop being hosted by the Indian poll panel, albeit under the aegis of the UN.

 Asked what kind of advice the commission could have for a conflict-ridden country such as Iraq, the panels legal adviser S.K. Mendiratta said: Our most important message to them is, assert your independence from the government, let the people have faith in you.

 Clearly, the psychological distance between India and the US-backed government of Iraq seems to be slowly narrowing. In fact, about a fortnight ago, Iraqs oil minister Hussein Al-Shahristani was in town to get to know petroleum minister Murli Deora.

 As for the Iraqi team, truth is, Baghdad had asked New Delhi if the Election Commission could send some representatives to Iraq about a couple of years ago, before elections to the transitional government were held. India had refused. It was plainly unwilling to even remotely be seen to be assisting the US-led invasion in any way.

 However, times have changed and so has New Delhi. Keen to build some sort of link with its civilisational friends in Mesopotamia, as well as expand the diversity of its ties with the US, New Delhi hit upon the perfect via media: Why not let Unami, the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq, organise and pay for a workshop on poll-related reforms that could be hosted by the Indian election panel?

 Clearly, India is fully involved. Mendiratta told The Telegraph the commission was sharing its expertise with the Iraqis.

 Former chief election commissioner M.S. Gill was at the workshop a couple of days ago to underline the importance of the Iraqi panel being separate from the government. Deputy election commissioner Rajarshi Bhattacharya is scheduled to speak to the group tomorrow.

 As for the Iraqi election commissioners, they may not have witnessed the peculiarly Indian way of sometimes stuffing ballot boxes, but theres a lifetime of other experiences written all over their faces.

 Hamdai Al-Hussaini, a former head of the legal department of the University of Babylon, spoke of how no real elections were held during the Saddam Hussein regime, but only polls in the nature of referendums which asked the single yes/no question about Hussein.

 If you ticked no, that ballot would be removed. Polling agents actually were Saddams security men. There was no competition, there was only one party, Hamdai said.

 Faraj M. Al-Haydari, the chairman of the Iraqi panel who returned to Iraq after the US invasion and after 30 years of living in Stockholm, pointed out that todays chaos was meant to frighten the people into hoping for one-party rule once again. But the people are not buying that, he said.

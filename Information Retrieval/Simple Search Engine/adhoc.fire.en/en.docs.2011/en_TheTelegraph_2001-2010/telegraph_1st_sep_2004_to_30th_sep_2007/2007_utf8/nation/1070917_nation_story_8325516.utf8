 Delhi poll pledge to Nepal 

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, Sept. 16: Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon today reaffirmed Indias support to Nepals peace process and its constituent assembly elections. 

 Menon (in picture) renewed the pledge during a meeting with Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala where talks focused on the security situation in Nepal, especially the Madheshi unrest in the Terai region bordering India. 

 The November 22 elections figured prominently in the talks and the ways in which India could help Nepal seal its southern borders to ensure trouble-free voting. 

 India acknowledges the critical importance of the elections to the constituent assembly in an environment free of fear and intimidation, Menon said. 

 The Maoists threat to quit the government also figured in the discussions, sources said. The former rebels, now part of the eight-party coalition headed by Koirala, want the government to accept a charter of demands that was to have been decided at a roundtable. 

 The meeting, slated for last Friday, was put off after Koirala told Maoists it would harm the peace process.

 Menon, who arrived here yesterday, also met the general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal, Madhav Kumar Nepal, and Maoist chief Prachanda among others. He left for Delhi this evening. 

 Menon is travelling to Beijing tomorrow for talks on the nuclear deal.

 Kapilvastu murder

 The killing of a former vigilante who had opposed the Maoists triggered communal clashes today in Kapilvastu, bordering Bihar. An indefinite curfew was clamped to bring the situation under control. 

 The violence erupted after Mohit Khan, the chief of the Democratic Madheshi Morcha, was shot dead by two bike-borne assailants near his home this morning.

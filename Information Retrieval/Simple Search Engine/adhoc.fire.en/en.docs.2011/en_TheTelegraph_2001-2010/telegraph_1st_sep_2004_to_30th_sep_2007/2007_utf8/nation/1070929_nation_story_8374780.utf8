 Snow traps 100 climbers

 Dehra Dun, Sept. 28 (PTI): Around 100 mountaineers, hikers, porters and guides from India and abroad are stranded across Uttarakhand after heavy snowfall.

 A climber from Gujarat, Kamesh Amin, died in a landslide at Urthing in Pithoragarh yesterday as it snowed in the higher reaches of the Garhwal and Kumaon Himalayas while it rained in the plains, official sources said.

 Four teams of climbers, cooks, porters and guides are stuck in the Garhwal Himalayas on the Harsil-Mana route while another team is trapped at Urthing after scaling the Panchachuli peak in the Kumaon region.

 We are trying to find out about the members of the four teams that took the Mana-Harsil trek route recently, following heavy snowfall in the region, said P.C. Dandriyal, the subdivisional magistrate in Bhatwari, Uttarkashi.

 The teams include four climbers from Russia, seven from Germany and one from Australia. The rest are Indians. There are at least 60 cooks, porters and guides in these teams. While three teams began their trek on September 18, the fourth one started the next day.

 The state government has asked the defence ministry for helicopters to rescue the climbers as bad weather is hampering the movement of rescue teams. 

 Rescue teams have retrieved one body from the Harsil-Mana route.

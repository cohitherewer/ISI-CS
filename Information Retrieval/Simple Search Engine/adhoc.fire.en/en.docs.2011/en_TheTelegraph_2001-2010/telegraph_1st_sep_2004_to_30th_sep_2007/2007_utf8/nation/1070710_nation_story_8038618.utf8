 Indian GRE runs into ministry wall

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 No relief?

 New Delhi, July 9: A Planning Commission proposal to centralise admissions to universities in India through a process similar to the GRE has been rejected by the human resource development ministry as unfeasible. 

 The proposal is irrational and unfeasible. We all want to reduce the burden on students but this proposal simply wont work, a senior ministry official told The Telegraph. 

 The Graduate Records Examination or GRE is a central examination that students seeking postgraduate admission in many English-speaking countries such as the US need to take. Their GRE performance determines which university they can seek admission to. 

 The proposal, now unlikely to see the light of day, could have saved students from the hassle of filling numerous admission forms and sitting for multiple entrance tests in their quest for higher education. 

 Had the proposal been accepted, students would have had to sit for an exam in the subject of their choice. The eligibility to get admission in Centre-funded universities which teach that subject would have been based on the marks obtained in the test. 

 While some professional courses like engineering, management and architecture have exams that span several institutes, no such common entrance test exists for pure sciences and humanities streams.

 Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia had discussed the proposal with Manmohan Singh last week, and the Prime Minister is learnt to have given the go-ahead. 

 The Prime Minister had recently announced that the Centre would finance 30 new universities, including one in each state. These universities, too, would have benefited from the proposal. 

 The National Knowledge Commission headed by Sam Pitroda is also learnt to be backing the proposal. 

 The proposal, the Planning Commission had suggested, could first be tried at the postgraduate level, where the number of students applying for admission is less than the undergraduate level. 

 Education officials in the ministry, after many internal meetings, however, argued against it. 

 The 21 central universities and 119 of the 222 state varsities, which the Centre either completely or partially funds, have their own admission process, the officials argued. 

 Their admission processes are different as they cater to students from different backgrounds, an official said. 

 The North Eastern Hill University and Aligarh Muslim University both central institutes were set up with definite aims of helping higher education in the Northeast and among minorities, the official said. 

 Making the admission process uniform would be challenging also because different universities have different levels of reservation, the official added.

 Haneefs wife Firdous in Bangalore after his arrest

 July 13: Mohammed Haneefs 

 family today thanked the Australian public and media for 

 criticising the unfair detention of the UK car-bomb 

 suspect in Brisbane.

 As news came in that Australian police will not seek further detention of the Indian doctor, his wife Firdous said in Bangalore: We are very happy. We are very thankful to the Australian people for taking up for a foreigner in such an assertive manner.

 Australians have swamped websites with protests as the police continued to detain Haneef since July 2 without charge.

 If it turns out that this man is not charged, Australia should hang its head in shame. An innocent man being held for so long without charge is unacceptable, wrote a reader, Steve, to news.com.au.

 David of Fremantle, western Australia, wrote in capital letters: Shame on you Australia.

 They have been very supportive and I must express my heartfelt gratefulness to them, Firdous said.

 The Australian media has reported that the police have found no evidence against Haneef, and his prolonged detention has faced stinging criticism from the countrys Law Council. Council president Tim Bugg yesterday dubbed it indefinite detention by any other name.

 Human rights group Amnesty International said: The whole case against Haneef undermines the presumption of innocence.

 Australian diplomatic sources said the comments by the council and rights groups had turned the global spotlight on Haneefs situation.

 Paul, an Australian, wrote that this poor man is a victim of terror in the hands of the Australian government and urged Haneef to sue the police for a sum in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

 It isnt clear if Haneef would choose to sue or how successfully he could do that but theres a precedent.

 Former Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks, nicknamed the Australian Taliban, has sued Canberra for allegedly breaching its duty to protect him as an Australian citizen by failing to call for a fair trial.

 Hicks was arrested in Afghanistan while allegedly fighting for the Taliban in 2002. He was sent back to Australia this May to serve out the remainder of a nine-month sentence handed in March.

 We are happy to hear that Australian police have not sought further extension of his custody, said Haneefs younger brother Shoaib, who was too disturbed by the detention to sit his final-year engineering exams this month.

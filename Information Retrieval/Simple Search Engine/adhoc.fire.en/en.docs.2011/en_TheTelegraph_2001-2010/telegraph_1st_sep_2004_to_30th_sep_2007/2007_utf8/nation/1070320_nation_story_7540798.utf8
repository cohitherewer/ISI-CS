 New Delhi, March 19: The Centre today launched a five-year plan to document the countrys monuments and antiques before they disappear without a trace.

 Right now, only some 7,000 monuments are protected 3,667 by the Archaeological Survey of India, the rest by state governments and some 4.5 lakh antique pieces are registered under the provisions of the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act.

 These numbers are minuscule compared to Indias vast and rich cultural heritage, culture secretary Badal K. Das said at the launch of the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities, attended by culture minister Ambika Soni and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia.

 At the centre of the mission will be an Archaeological Survey of India team, which will co-ordinate with state governments and voluntary organisations to put in place an easily accessible register of monuments. This would include half-forgotten structures that have not been identified as monuments and are fast disappearing without any record. The team will similarly document antiques.

 According to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, anything classified as a monument must be at least 100 years old. The national mission, however, will also consider any structure that existed before Independence. The mission hopes to generate awareness on conservation and perhaps pick select monuments for more attention.

 In 2003, the Centre set up a mission to track manuscripts. A few months later, then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced plans to set up the monuments mission.

 The culture ministry has also circulated among other ministries and state governments a draft of the proposed bill for establishing a heritage sites commission a permanent, autonomous body with a wider mandate than the just-launched national mission on monuments. Also planned are amendments to the antiquities act, making it more stringent.

 The Centre has allocated Rs 90 crore for the five-year project on monuments, but Soni is lobbying for more funds. She proposed an amendment to the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS), under which parliamentarians get Rs 2 crore every year to spend on development projects in their constituencies or, if they are from the Rajya Sabha, in their states.

 Conservation of monuments is not listed among such projects. The tourism ministry is working on a proposal that would give MPs that option as well.

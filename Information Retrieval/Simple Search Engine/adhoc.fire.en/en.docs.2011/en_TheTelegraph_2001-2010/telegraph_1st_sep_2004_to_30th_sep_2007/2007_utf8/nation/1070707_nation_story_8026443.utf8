 BJP assets push to Shekhawat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 6: Bhairon Singh Shekhawat is being pressured by L.K. Advani and other BJP leaders to declare his assets voluntarily before the Election Commission by tomorrow.

 His election minder, Sushma Swaraj, will meet him tonight and stress that he must do it at the earliest, both to counter the poll panels snub and claim moral high ground against the UPA-Left.

 On Thursday, the commission had rejected Advanis plea that it be made mandatory for presidential and vice-presidential candidates to declare their assets, saying Parliament alone was empowered to amend the act governing the polls. 

 A source close to Shekhawat (in picture), who is contesting the presidential poll as an Independent candidate with the NDAs backing, said he was being forced to consider the proposal seriously.

 A BJP source said the chances of him doing it were 50-50. When Advani had petitioned the poll panel, he reportedly asked Shekhawat to tell his chartered accountant to get the papers ready. At that point, he didnt appear too keen, said a BJP source. 

 Asked what the BJP hoped to gain through the disclosure, a source said: It will bring moral pressure on Pratibha Patil to do the same.

 Third front bid

 Although Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav conveyed to Shekhawat today that he would not be able to support him, the BJP persisted with its efforts to bring the third front of which Mulayam is a part around.

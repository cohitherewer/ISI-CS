 Forest trap fells jawans

 - Twenty-four killed in raid on Maoist camp

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Raipur, July 10: Twenty-three security personnel, including a CRPF assistant commandant, were killed when they walked into a Maoist trap in Dantewada district late last evening. 

 A villager also died in the attack and about 12 others were seriously injured.

 Police claimed that 20 rebels were killed, but no bodies have been found. 

 Acting on a tip-off that Maoists were camping in the forests near Mariyaguda village, about 520km south of Chhattisgarh capital Raipur, a team of 115 securitymen left for the spot yesterday afternoon. 

 The team, led by the CRPF assistant command- ant, included CRPF jawans, policemen and special security officers villagers recruited by the state government to fight the rebels. The security personnel stormed the camp, forcing the rebels into the forest. 

 A few sangham members Maoist supporters detained from the spot told the force another camp was located about 3km away and the rebels might have taken shelter there.

 Walking into the trap, the jawans headed deep into the forest in search of the camp, and came under fire from all sides. Sources said about 300 to 400 rebels were involved in the operation and sprayed bullets from sophisticated weapons besides triggering a series of explosions. 

 The jawans gave up the fight when they ran out of ammunition. Heavy rain and darkness also worked against them. The gun battle lasted till 8.30pm, when the security team retreated.

 When the jawans returned to their camp, 23 personnel were missing. A search was launched, and the bodies were found this afternoon in the forest near Mariyaguda, adjoining the Andhra Pradesh border.

 Apart from the civilian, who could not be identified, and the CRPF assistant commandant, 15 CRPF jawans were among the dead, inspector-general of police (Bastar) R.K. Vij said.

 Earlier in the day, home minister Ramvichar Netam had said in a statement in the Assembly that the jawans were missing and there was no report of casualties. 

 The second major Naxalite attack this year after the Raniboldi massacre in mid-March in which over 50 people were killed came five days after Vishwaranjan, an Intelligence Bureau officer, took over as the state police chief.

 Had the jawans been kidnapped and the rebels demanded the release of their senior leaders to spare their lives, the state government would have found itself in a fix, said a senior police officer.

 A number of senior Maoist leaders have been arrested in the past couple of years. Of them, Narayan Sanyal the lone contemporary of Charu Majumdar, the founder of the Naxalite movement tops the list. Sanyal was arrested in January last year. Last month, a hardcore Maoist leader, Gopanna, was arrested in Raipur while two days ago, another Maoist commander, Jaipal Reddy, and his wife Nirmala Akka, were held in Bijapur.

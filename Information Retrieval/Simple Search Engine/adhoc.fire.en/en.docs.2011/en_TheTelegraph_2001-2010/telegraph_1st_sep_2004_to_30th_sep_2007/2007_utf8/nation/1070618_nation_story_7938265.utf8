NATION BRIEFS

 New Delhi, June 17 (PTI): Organisers of the six-nation BDO Champions Challenge hockey tournament in Boom, Belgium, have withdrawn a distorted map of India placed on its official website after a report about it hit headlines today.

 The website carried the map without Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

 The organisers have not responded to emails seeking a reaction to the faux pas. Now, under the team profile, only the Tricolour appears.

 New Delhi (PTI): Relatives of prisoners of war who recently visited Pakistan to locate family members missing since the 1971 war have said they were not allowed to talk to the inmates. They allowed us to speak to the jail superintendent and frisk the jail records, said B.K. Suri, the head of Missing Defence Personnel Association. 

 Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (AP): India, China and Pakistan are among the countries considering contributing troops to form a joint African Union-UN peacekeeping force to go into Darfur, South Africas envoy to the UN, Dumisani Kumalo, said on Saturday after a meeting between UN Security Council ambassadors and AU officials.

 Alibag (PTI): A man who was unable to repay money taken from his friends poisoned his family on Saturday night, after which two of his children died. Dynadeo Nemani has been arrested.

 Mumbai (PTI): A court has sentenced a Nigerian to 10 years rigorous imprisonment under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and the Customs Act. Raymond Yusuf was arrested in 1999 for trying to export 5 kg of heroin to Lagos, Nigeria.

 Srinagar (PTI): A German tourist, who was shocked by the levels of pollution in the Dal Lake, on Sunday joined NGOs in cleaning up the water body. Marc Stollreiter, 30, along with friend Birgit Lenger hired around 60 labourers to clean the Nehru Park part of the lake.

 Jewel gang caught

 Bangalore, Aug. 21: Police have closed in on an armed gang that raided a jewellery store earlier this month and walked away with gold and silver ornaments worth Rs 3 crore, reports our special correspondent.

 Of the 11 people involved in the daylight robbery, three have been arrested from different parts of Karnataka and 5.5kg of the 35kg heist have been recovered so far.

 Police sources said the robbers hatched the plot while they were undertrials sharing the same barracks in Mumbais Arthur Road jail a few months ago. 

 A police team has been sent to Mumbai to find out the names of the other criminals who shared the same barracks. They are believed to be from Mumbai, Delhi and Patna.

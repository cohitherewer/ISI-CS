 House waits for probe to end 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 23: Parliament cant act on its own against the five Lok Sabha MPs from the BJP and the Bahujan Samaj Party accused of being involved in the trafficking racket, said sources in the parliamentary affairs ministry. 

 They explained that since the charges against the members, including the BJPs Babubhai Katara and the BSPs Mitrasen Yadav, were being investigated by Delhi police and their trial, if necessary, was a while away, there was little or nothing that Parliament could do now.

 The racket, which came to light when Katara was held while trying to smuggle a woman to Canada on his wifes passport, is likely to figure at the all-party meeting called by Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee on April 25, a day before Parliament resumes its budget session.

 One view within the government is that because of a few black sheep, the entire political establishment should not be hanged. This belief counters a debate, started by opinion-makers, on whether MPs were getting more than their share of rights and privileges, and whether these were being abused. After the Katara affair, many are asking if these perks should be curtailed.

 Ministry sources said the emigration racket was different from the two other recent scams involving lawmakers. One was the cash-for-query sting operation in which some MPs were caught taking money on camera for asking questions in Parliament. The other showed how MPs used funds under the local area development scheme to grant personal favours in return for money. 

 The presiding officers of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha had set up committees to investigate the charges before taking action against the errant members. 

 In the cash-for-query case, where proof of the MPs guilt was clinching, the leader of the Lok Sabha moved a resolution recommending their expulsion. The House adopted it unanimously. The lone Rajya Sabha MP from the BJP was expelled on the recommendation of the party.

 No conclusive evidence was found in the case of abuse of funds meant for local area development. But Parliament felt there was enough ground to suspect the integrity of the MPs caught on camera. As a result, they were suspended.

 In the emigration racket, government sources said the best course would be to put pressure on the parties concerned to take action against their MPs and wait for them to recommend termination of their membership.

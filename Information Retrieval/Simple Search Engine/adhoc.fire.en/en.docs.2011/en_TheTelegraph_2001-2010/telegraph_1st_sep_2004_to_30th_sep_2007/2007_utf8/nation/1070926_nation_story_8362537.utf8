 Widow rape charge on relatives 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: A 28-year-old widow was allegedly raped by her sister-in-laws husband and their two sons over 20 days.

 Bablu Das, 50, Sanjay Das, 23, and Sudip Das, 21, were arrested today after she filed a complaint at the Entally police station. The woman was staying with the Das family at their Convent Road home since her husband, a private firm employee, died two years back, police said.

 Bablu, a small-time trader, made many advances towards the woman before he began abusing her physically, the police said. In her complaint, the woman said she didnt approach the police earlier fearing social stigma. 

 The torture worsened over the past two weeks when Sanjay, a jobless school dropout, and his college-going brother Sudip also began raping her, the complaint said.

 Bangla train on trial

 Hundreds of Bangladeshis clapped and waved as the first train from India (in Reuters picture) in 42 years rolled past the Darshana frontier post on Sunday.

 Railway and home ministry officials on board were offered bouquets and sweets, a warm build-up to the talks over the next few days when plans to start a full-scale Sealdah-Dhaka service next month will be finalised.

 The trial train carrying the 31-member delegation, led by additional home secretary A.E. Ahmed, reached Dhaka in the evening. 

 When the daily service begins, the Moitree Express a chain of 10 sleek, blue coaches is expected to ferry around 760 passengers. 

 According to tentative plans, it will leave Dhaka at 7.45am and Sealdah at 7am. The journey will take around 11 hours, including the time for immigration checks. Fares across three classes will range from Rs 328 to Rs 820.

 The service was suspended after the 1965 war between India and Pakistan, when Bangladesh was Pakistans eastern province.

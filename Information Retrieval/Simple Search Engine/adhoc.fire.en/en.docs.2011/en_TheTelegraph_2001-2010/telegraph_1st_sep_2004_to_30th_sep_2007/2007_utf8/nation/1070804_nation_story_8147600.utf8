 BSP or Bahujan Satish Party

 DHIRENDRA K. JHA

New Delhi, Aug. 3: Dalit leaders have privately labelled BSP the Bahujan Satish Party.

 The reason: family members of Satish Chandra Mishra, the man credited with getting Brahmins to vote for the Bahujan Samaj Party, are ruling the roost in Uttar Pradesh. (See chart)

 Mishra became a cabinet minister when Mayavati swept to power on the strength of the Dalit-Brahmin axis in May, and soon people close to him were occupying top posts.

 Dalit leaders in the BSP are murmuring protests but no one dares speak out. 

 Sources close to Mishra said that while Mayavati has a bigger role planned for her partys Brahmin face, he is making his own calculations to keep his influence in Lucknow intact. 

 As the chief minister prepares to field Mishra to widen the BSPs social base outside Uttar Pradesh, her right-hand man is gearing up to make nephew Anant his successor in the ministry. He has been given the BSP ticket for the Farukhabad Assembly bypoll.

 As a backup in case of Anants election defeat, Mishra has old aide Nakul Dubey already a minister in the Mayavati government ready to take on his mantle, the sources said. 

 Mishra is a cabinet minister without portfolio and is also a member of the Rajya Sabha. He completes six months in government on November 13 and if he is not elected to the Uttar Pradesh House by then, he will cease to be minister.

 An indication that the BSP chief, who is now eager to grow beyond Uttar Pradesh, wants Mishra to take the social engineering into newer areas and expand the social base of the party came last month when Mayavati decided against nominating him to the state legislative council. 

 Before Mishra returns to Delhi, Mayavati has started talking to upper caste dissident leaders from the Congress and the BJP in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Haryana. She is also on the lookout for such dissidents in Maharashtra and Rajasthan.

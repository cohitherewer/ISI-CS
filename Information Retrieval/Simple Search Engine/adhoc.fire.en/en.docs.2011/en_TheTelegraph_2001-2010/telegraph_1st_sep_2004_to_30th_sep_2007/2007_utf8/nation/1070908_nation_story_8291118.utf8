 Mac fined

 New Delhi, Sept. 7 (PTI): McDonalds has been asked to pay Rs 10,000 to a vegetarian customer for serving a non-vegetarian burger. 

 Vimal Launaich Chaudhary had ordered a Veg Surprise and an aloo tikki burger and after few bites, she smelt something unusual and began vomiting. 

 A consumer forum fined the chain for hurting religious sentiments of the woman, a follower of the Arya Samaj.

 Chaudhary, who did not take even eggs, had sent a legal notice to the restaurant seeking compensation of Rs 60,000.

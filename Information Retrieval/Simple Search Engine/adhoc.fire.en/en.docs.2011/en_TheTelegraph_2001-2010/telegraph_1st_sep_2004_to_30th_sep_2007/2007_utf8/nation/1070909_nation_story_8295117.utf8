 Centre pins hopes on Bengal Left

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: The government is banking on the Bengal Left to pull its nuclear chestnuts out of the fire when the 15-member Left-UPA political committee on the Indo-US deal meets here next week.

 Government sources said there were some indications that the Bengal communists could help broker a compromise between the two widely divergent positions over the nuclear deal.

 While the Left parties have made it clear that the government cannot take the next step atomic energy chief Anil Kakodkar cannot meet IAEA director-general Mohammed ElBaradei the Centre has said it will not back down on the agreement.

 The government is hoping the Bengal communists will persuade the Left leadership to evolve a middle path. That is, they could tell their Delhi counterparts that a rigid stand would trigger elections for which nobody was prepared and which could spell doom for the party.

 The first meeting of the political committee, to be chaired by Pranab Mukherjee, is expected to take place sometime next week, perhaps even before the foreign minister travels to South Korea on September 16-17.

 Asked what the government meant by a middle path, the sources said the political committee could announce that the Lefts concerns are being taken into account before the nuclear deal is operationalised. However, those concerns would not amount to a veto over the deal, the sources emphasised.

 If the Bengal communists are unable to bridge the gap, the government would have to take a call on whether it should go ahead with the deal or swallow its pride and save the UPA alliance.

 The government would wait until early or mid-October to see how the political committee was doing before it took that call, the sources said.

 The first few meetings of the political committee will give us a good idea of whether a compromise is possible or not.

 Even under normal circumstances, a Kakodkar-ElBaradei meeting was scheduled only for early or mid-October, the sources pointed out. 

 That meeting would have given direction to the negotiating group comprising officials of the department of atomic energy and the foreign ministry to finalise an India-specific IAEA agreement.

 The sources said there was no internal deadline for the committee to wrap up its work, but insisted that it could not go on and on discussing and debating the pros and cons of the deal.

 CPM letter to MPs

 In an open letter, the CPM central committee yesterday urged MPs to note the discriminatory tone of the Hyde Act, which would kick into force if India conducted a nuclear test.

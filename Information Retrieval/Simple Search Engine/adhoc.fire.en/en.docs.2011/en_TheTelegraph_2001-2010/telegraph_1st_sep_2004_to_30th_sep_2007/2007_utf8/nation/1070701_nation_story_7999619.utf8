 Patil plea snub for Advani

 Pratibha Patil

 New Delhi, June 30: The UPA-Left cocked a snook at BJP leader L.K. Advanis plea to the Prime Minister to replace Pratibha Patil as its presidential candidate by filing two additional sets of nominations for her on the last date of withdrawal.

 Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Pratibhas official representative, harped on the solidarity message through the process, not legally required because Pratibha had solicited the required number of proposers and seconders when she filed her nomination.

 Every part of India, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, supported her candidature, the first woman candidate, he said.

 As the BJP sustained the pitch of its anti-Pratibha campaign its latest allegation was the Muktabai SSK sugar cooperative factory that she founded in 1983 was not only a loan defaulter, but had also diverted sugar meant for export to the domestic market in 2001-02 the NDA suffered another split. 

 After the Shiv Sena ditched the alliance, the Trinamul Congress did not sign Bhairon Singh Shekhawats nomination papers. 

 Sonia Gandhi today called a meeting of her office-bearers to seek a report on the ground situation in Congress-ruled states. Thanks to the speculation that the dirt against Pratibha was being dug out by Maharashtra Congress members and supplied to the BJP and the fear that MLAs might vote according to their conscience, the Congress chief was especially keen on the scene in the state.

 Party sources said she was assured that the reality was the opposite. There were cracks in the BJP legislature parties in Gujarat and Rajasthan where anti-Narendra Modi and Gujjar MLAs could vote against Shekhawat to vent their ire against the chief ministers.

 If that was the cheery part of the Congress story, there was a grim underbelly as well.

 Barring Pranab Mukherjee, no other big name that figured as a presidential prospective has been involved in the run-up. Shivraj Patil did not come out in Pratibhas defence despite being a senior Maharashtra leader. The anti-Arjun Singh camp said the sulking Thakur was covertly drumming up support for Shekhawat.

 Neither was the sorority active. Leaders like Mohsina Kidwai (who was considered), Sheila Dikshit (stung because her name was not on the table), Ambika Soni, Begum Noor Bano, Rita Bahuguna Joshi and Margaret Alva (not considered) were mum on the gender plank.

 Bank loot

 Bhubaneswar/Jamshedpur, March 23: Armed dacoits looted about Rs 2.5 crore in 45 minutes from the Barbil branch of Bank of Baroda in Keonjhar district today. 

 Sources said about nine dacoits disguised as customers entered the bank around 10.10 am and overpowered the solitary guard at the gate. Brandishing guns, they asked the customers and the staff to keep quiet. 

 The gang had snatched cellphones of the staff and the customers. Soon, two of them took me and another officer, S. Bhattacharya, to the strongroom and demanded that we open the cash vault. 

 We tried to buy time by telling them the key was with the head cashier, who hadnt come in by then. But the head cashier entered then and we had no option but to open the vault, said branch manager P.K. Panda.

 CBI wants 44 hanged for blasts 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 15: The CBI today demanded the death sentence for 44 of the 100 Bombay blasts convicts, including prime accused Tiger Memons three brothers, and life terms for 42 others.

 But the agency sympathetically recommended lighter punishments for all the three women convicts among them Rubina Memon, wife of Tigers acquitted brother Suleiman and two ailing men: a bomb planter and a Customs officer.

 To finish its arguments on the quantum of sentence in a single day, the CBI split the convicts into three groups. 

 The first included the 47 nailed under Section 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and the anti-terror law Tada, with more than a dozen bomb planters among them.

 The 44 who faced only Tada charges formed the second group, and the nine convicted under the Customs Act and the Arms Act made up the third.

 The agency demanded the death penalty for the first group barring three. 

 It took a softer line on Rubina because she is a woman, on bomb planter Imtiaz Ghavate because he is HIV-positive, and on Customs official Somnath Thapa, who has lung cancer.

 Ecstasy effect

 MDMA (methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine), commonly known as Ecstasy, has long been a part of rave culture. 

 Illegal in most countries, the drug induces heightened feelings of openness, empathy, energy and euphoria in users. For some, tactile sensations are enhanced, making physical contact with others more pleasurable. 

 The short-term health risks include hypertension, dehydration and hypothermia. 

 The drugs stimulatory effects can mask the bodys normal sense of exhaustion and thirst and impair judgement. Overdoses are rare, but 10 to 100 people die each year in the US with MDMA in their blood samples.

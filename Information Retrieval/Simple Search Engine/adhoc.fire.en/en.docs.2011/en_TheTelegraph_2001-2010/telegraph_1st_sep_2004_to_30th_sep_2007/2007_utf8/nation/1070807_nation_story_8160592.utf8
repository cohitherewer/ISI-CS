 Salman chews collar in court

 Mumbai, Aug. 6: Salman Khan today nervously kept chewing his collar in a Jodhpur court as he appealed his five-year jail term in a 1998 chinkara poaching case.

 Wearing a shirt, jeans and a denim cap, the star sat quietly in the district and sessions court but betrayed signs that the fate of buddy Sanjay Dutt was hanging heavy on his mind.

 Salman Khan looked very nervous and kept chewing his collar through the defence-prosecution arguments, an onlooker said.

 The court had made it mandatory for the 42-year-old actor to appear before it today as he had ignored several summons earlier.

 The arguments will continue tomorrow, following which the judge will give his verdict, Salmans lawyer Hastimal Saraswat said.

 We have said that the forensic report of the animal does not prove it to be a chinkara. Moreover, if four people can be freed by the court on lack of evidence, how can Salman alone be found guilty?

 Salman was sentenced to five years in jail under the Wildlife Protection Act in April 2006 for hunting a chinkara, a protected deer species sacred to the Bishnois of Rajasthan. He spent two nights in jail but was later given bail.

 He had allegedly killed the animal at a Ghoda farmhouse on September 26, 1998. Bishnoi leaders had filed an FIR against him and a strong public movement for his arrest started.

 Harish Dulani, the driver of the car in which Salman had gone hunting, had claimed in his eyewitness account that the actor slit the chinkaras throat with a knife and wiped his hands on the ground, leaving others to cover the blood with sand.

 Later, the hunting party it included actor Satish Shah, who has been let off went to a small hotel owned by one Mohammad Hassan. The kitchen was opened at 2.30am and the meat cooked and eaten, Dulani alleged.

 The chinkara poaching case was registered against Salman and five others under the Indian Penal Code, the Wildlife Protection Act and the Indian Arms Act at Mathania police station on October 11, 1998.

 The actor, who flew to Jodhpur on Sunday, will appear at the hearing of another poaching case on Wednesday. He hopes to be back in Mumbai in time for the release of his first Hollywood film, Marigold, on August 12.

 The same court had convicted him in the chinkara case last year. It had also given him a one-year term in February 2006 for killing two black bucks a protected antelope species in 1998.

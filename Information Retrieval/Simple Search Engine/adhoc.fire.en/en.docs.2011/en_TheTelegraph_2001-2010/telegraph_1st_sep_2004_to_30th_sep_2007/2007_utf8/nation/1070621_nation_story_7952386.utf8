 Kalam willing if voters cross over

 New Delhi, June 20: A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is willing to be President again, if victory is certain.

 A day after the UPA-Left signalled to Kalam that they were unwilling to concede a second term for him, the President told the third front he was open to the idea if sufficient support was a certainty. 

 As of now, victory can be a certainty only if Kalam campaigns for large-scale cross-voting or conscience voting. The UPA has around 125,000 votes more than the combined tally of the NDA and the third front. 

 Telugu Desam Party chief N. Chandrababu Naidu, who called on Kalam with Mulayam Singh Yadav, Om Prakash Chautala and Babulal Marandi, told reporters: You can draw your conclusions. Everything is possible.

 A Rashtrapati Bhavan source articulated Kalams position a little more. During his meeting with the UNPA delegation, the President observed that as there is overwhelming love and affection of the people from all sections of society and from all parts of the country, I can accept a second term of presidency, provided there is certainty about this (victory). 

 Kalam told his visitors that he was willing to wait for a few days for the certainty to play itself out, the source added.

 Asked if the statement signified a shift from the Presidents earlier position that he would go for another term only if there was an across-the-board consensus on his name, an aide said: Yes, certainly. There is a difference between consensus and certainty. If the numbers are in his favour in a contest, he is willing to go for it. He is not thinking of packing his bags yet.

 The aide claimed that Kalam feels the Congress and the other UPA allies would eventually come around to supporting him just as they did the last time. But Rashtrapati Bhavan is still unsure of the Lefts support. 

 However, unlike in 2002, when the BJP and the Janata Dal (United) pulled off a coup by whipping out Kalams name at the last minute and playing on the minority appeal to stymie the Congress, the scenario appeared far less loaded in the incumbents favour this time.

 The Congress, which privately felt that Kalam might have got more swayed by the opinion polls on his popularity than hard political assessment, emphasised there was no way it would bite the minority-secular bait dangled by the third front.

 Naidu spoke to Sonia Gandhi but she is learnt to have declined to withdraw the UPA candidate, Pratibha Patil.

 In another rebuff to the consensus brigade, the Congress Working Committee will meet tomorrow. All chief ministers of the party are expected to attend the meeting at which they will be told to guard against cross-voting.

 The NDA was non-committal on its support, despite Kalams loud hint today. Spokesperson Sushma Swaraj stuck to the position that if Kalam agreed to fight, NDA candidate Bhairon Singh Shekhawat would withdraw. Our votes will go fully to Kalam but he will have to assess his winnability before that, she stressed. 

 Naidu called on Atal Bihari Vajpayee but was told that the former Prime Minister would have to consult his NDA allies before taking a call. 

 Sushma appealed to the RJD, NCP, the BSP and Ram Vilas Paswan to reconsider their support to Pratibha. If the UPA allies respond positively, the Congress should also rethink. Then the countrys desire to give Kalam a second term will be fulfilled, she said.

 However, she avoided answering a question on whether the NDA used to dropping in on Kalam at the slightest provocation with complaints will march to Rashtrapati Bhavan and proffer its support. The Shiv Sena, a key NDA constituent, has so far refused to back Kalam.

 But that the UNPA was determined to make a fight of it was evident by the speed with which Samajwadi Partys Amar Singh fixed appointments with leaders of the CPM, CPI and the NCP for tomorrow. 

 Unfazed, the BJPs Independent contender, Shekhawat, persisted with his efforts. His astrologers are reportedly trying to find a propitious date and time for filing nomination.

 Snag blame on A320

 Pressure problem

 New Delhi, March 9: The government is blaming hydraulic failures in Airbus A320s for technical snags troubling Indian, the state-run carrier, over the past few years.

 This aircraft makes up much of the airlines fleet. More variants of it are being ordered. 

 In an action-taken report circulated among members of a parliamentary panel, the civil aviation ministry says hydraulic failures in Airbus A320s are a known problem area and that several incidents have taken place.

 Why is it that only our airlines are facing this hydraulic failure and not others? Is something wrong in the way we maintain our aircraft or are the parts spurious? asked Dinesh Trivedi, an MP whos a member of the parliamentary consultative committee on civil aviation.

 Trivedi, who refused to divulge what was discussed at the committees meeting, wondered why more of the same aircraft was being purchased. Indian has placed orders for 43 A320s at an estimated cost of over Rs 9,000 crore.

 Trivedi had asked if the snags were because of the lack of trained engineers, but the ministry rejected this contention, saying technical problems with the aircrafts rudder supply hose, nose wheel steering hoses and hydraulic seals were responsible.

 An airline spokesperson described the problems as an industry phenomenon, but said things have been solved. These are modern aircraft where most systems, including flight controls and landing gears, are hydraulic-based, he added. However, the problem mostly concerns hydraulic systems that use flexible hoses, he said.

 The report says while some problems have been sorted out after consulting the manufacturer, other modifications are in progress. However, it does say some areas need improvements, which Indian will have to make after talks with the manufacturer and vendor. 

 The report also cites hydraulic failures in the brake system line of an A300 aircraft of Air-India at Jeddah.

 One step at a time to stay on reforms road

 Sonia: Playing safe

 New Delhi, Feb. 11: Want to go the reforms distance? Then stick to the straight and narrow.

 The government appears to be thinking along this line on the three contentious economic issues it has grappled with recently: special economic zones, divestment of public sector units and pension reforms.

 Highly placed sources hinted that such an approach, unlikely to change over the next two years of the UPAs tenure, was essentially meant to keep Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the left-of-centre elements in the party happy and avoid tangling with the Left or other allies.

 The broad parameters of the outlook are: SEZs will be cleared only under foolproof circumstances; PSUs would be divested case by case in keeping with the common minimum programme, and pension reforms would be implemented through an administrative mechanism.

 The last means there might be no further talks with the Left, which was against the pension regulatory authority bill in its present form. The government is in no hurry to restart the dialogue (with the Left), said a source.

 The sources said this approach is expected to achieve two objectives. First, the government could travel some distance on the reforms path without jeopardising its stability by angering the Left and, second, not undermine the Congress or Sonias image as people-friendly and not one representing the corporates.

 The empowered group of ministers on SEZs, headed by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, is supposed to have completed discussions with various political parties. The sources said the tentative conclusion is no overriding view on SEZs could be formed because the representatives the group met had different views, depending on the regions they came from.

 For instance, those from Haryana, Punjab and Gujarat felt SEZs were an ideal means to tap investments and land acquisition was not problematic if government intervention was minimal and if the bidder and the seller were given the freedom to clinch deals.

 The experience from the east was different. So, no one conclusive view on whether SEZs are desirable or undesirable can be formed, said a source.

 The Congress members of the empowered group who include commerce minister Kamal Nath, finance minister P. Chidambaram and law minister H.R. Bhardwaj might meet Sonia next week to share their views.

 The sources said the thinking was that the best way to get around the SEZ maze was to allow developers to first acquire land before approaching the government to clear projects. This would mean no in-principle approvals, which, at present, precede the final go-ahead.

 The view is, the source added, let a state government facilitate land acquisition either by taking it over directly or allowing the bidder to buy it and after that stage is completed, the Centre can step in to look at the project.

 On PSU divestment, the government has decided on a transparent and consultative case-by-case approach and that, generally, profit-making units will not be touched.

 However, the Congress has conveyed to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that if he re-opens the divestment of Nalco and Neyveli Lignite put on hold last September the partys trade union wing Intuc and the DMKs Progressive Labour Federation would have to be consulted. Last July, Intuc and the DMK union had opposed the sale of the governments shares.

 On pension reforms, the government has proposed that an interim investment pattern, announced recently by Chidambaram, would be notified for funds collected under the new scheme to allow 5 per cent investment of the corpus in the stock market.

 Mount Everest: Easy walk to peak?

 June 20: China is black-topping an existing road to Mount Everest on the Tibet side not building a new one ostensibly to make the trip to the worlds highest peak easier for bearers of the Olympic flame.

 The 150-million yuan ($19.66 million) project will involve black-topping the 108-km unpaved road to the foot of the mountain, and will take four months to complete.

 Several Indian military expeditions to Mount Everest in the past three years have taken the north (Tibet) route to the summit. The mountain can be climbed from Nepal the more popular route or China.

 Two expeditions one each of the navy and the air force took the China road because they wanted to scale the more difficult north face. A 10-woman army expedition in 2005 chose the route to avoid getting caught up in Nepal where Maoist rebels were a threat. 

 All the teams say the Chinese always had a motorable road to the Everest Base Camp. 

 Wing Commander Amit Chowdhary, an alumnus of Jadavpur University, led the air force expedition in June 2005. This road to Everest from what I read is an old plan, he said.

 Two years back, we drove down from Lhasa to the Everest Base Camp about 1000 km across the Tibetan plateau. We knew they were going to black-top it shortly. I think the road was built in 1960. It was a perfectly flat, motorable road on which vehicles, including buses, ply all the time. You can even ride bicycles on stretches. There are also horse-drawn carriages, said Chaudhary, who has since left the air force. 

 Commander Satyabrata Dam summitted Everest with the navy team he was leading in May 2004, a year before the air force team. When we were there, we did see some kind of road-building activity. There was a road of course I would say it was jeepable and not entirely kuccha. Its not that we were driving through wilderness. We knew they were planning to upgrade the road. It took us about six hours by Land Cruiser from Tingri (in Tibet) to (Everest) Base Camp. I think now they are trying to make a proper pucca road. But I am not sure if they are extending the road, said the submariner who has skiied across the Antarctic. 

 There is a Chinese Liaison Officers hut at Base Camp and a post office. From where the road ends I would say the snout of the Rhombuk Glacier is 4 km. If they are planning to extend this road, it could be very, very damaging because they might have to blast through ridges of the Everest. But frankly I cannot be sure of what they (the Chinese) are planning.

 Environmentalists have raised concern that the black-topped road could draw more tourists to the base camp. If the inflow is accompanied by the usual spurt in development activities, it could lead to an ecological disaster, they say.

 The black-topping could be seen as a way for China the master of gestures to underscore its claim on Tibet.

 All credit to Mauni baba

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Ajitabh: Absent

 Jan. 15: Arjun Singh may still be waiting for him to play kingmaker, but the Mauni baba of Ujjain is already being hailed as the countrys top matchmaker.

 As Aishwarya Rais family today confessed the timing of her engagement to Abhishek Bachchan had taken them by surprise, the grapevine credited the baba with the final go-ahead for the ceremony.

 Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh, a friend of the Bachchans, was in Ujjain today, ostensibly to conclude a year-long yagna for world peace at the babas ashram.

 But ashram sources said the yagna was related to the baba countering Ashs Mangal dosh the evil eye of Mars in her horoscope that had cast a shadow over the planned marriage with Abhishek. Amar, however, denied he had come to thank the baba.

 The baba had been trying to appease Mars for the past one year and yesterday gave the all-clear, an ashram source said.

 The wait has been longer for Arjun, the Union human resource development minister who counts the holy man as his spiritual guru.

 Its reportedly on his advice that Arjun, soon after the Babri Masjid demolition, had risked his political career by taking on P.V. Narasimha Rao.

 The baba is believed to have convinced him that he had the raj yoga (royal sign) in his horoscope, which meant he was destined to be Prime Minister.

 That was in 1993-94. Thirteen years on, Arjun is still taking on Prime Ministers although less directly but the crown has stayed elusive.

 If not one of 13 years, the Rais, too, seem to have reconciled themselves to a longer wait. When a film director congratulated Ashs mother, she said she had had no idea about the engagement date.

 Which was why Ashs father Krishnaraj was away in Cochin and her sister-in-law in Bangalore, both missing the family celebrations.

 From the Bachchans side, Abhisheks uncle Ajitabh was a notable absentee. Sources said he had been invited minutes before the ceremony but did not turn up.

 Yet it had been Ajitabh who, last February, had broken the news to the media that he had been to Bangalore to meet astrologer Chandrashekhar Swamy with the couples horoscopes. Swamy later acknowledged this and added that if God willed so, the wedding would happen.

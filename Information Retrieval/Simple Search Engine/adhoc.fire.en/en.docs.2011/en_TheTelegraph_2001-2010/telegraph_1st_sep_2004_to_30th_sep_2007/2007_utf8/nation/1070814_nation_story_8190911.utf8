 Deoghar/Dumka, Aug. 13: A sudden rush by hundreds of impatient devotees at the Deoghar temple today crushed four women and a teenaged girl to death. 

 The administration, however, insisted the women had lost their balance and fallen to their death from the temple stairs. But eyewitnesses said they were killed in a stampede.

 The victims, other devotees said, were actually standing outside the barricades through which the queue was moving towards the sanctum sanctorum.

 As they awaited their turn to enter, the unruly devotees behind them tried to break the queue and force their way in, crushing the women against the barricade. The post-mortem is expected to reveal if they had died of suffocation or some other cause.

 Gajadhar Singh from Deoria, Uttar Pradesh, who was standing in another queue, said the women were jostling and fighting.

 They were screaming and hitting each other. They seemed to be in a frenzy, he said.

 Urmila Devi, a survivor, broke down as she described how the sudden pressure of the crowd behind her had flung her away, saving her life.

 I was unable to reach the sanctum sanctorum and worship the Lord, she said, but He undoubtedly saved me from certain death today.

 Several other women were injured. After order was restored in the afternoon and the victims rushed to hospital, the devotees vent their anger at the poor arrangements.

 A stunned Rajdevi from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, who lost her sister-in-law, said: We have been visiting Deoghar for the past 10 years but never saw such mismanagement before.

 Rajdevis relative Shanti Devi, 55, was the lone victim identified till this evening. The bodies have been shifted from the Sadar Hospital to the Jasidih primary health centre. This was done to disperse the swelling crowd. 

 Devotees complained they were not being allowed to see the bodies. How can we identify them, screamed one of them. The administration said photographs of the dead would be put up at all the camps. 

 The Dumka district administration heaved a sigh of relief when chief minister Madhu Koda cancelled his planned visit to the Basukinath temple at Jarmundi. 

 Pilgrims there turned violent today, complaining of inadequate arrangements after three of them suffered serious injuries when a wall collapsed at a newly built dharamshala. The wall had caved in because of heavy rain, officials said.

 Small win for doctors

 London, March 5 (PTI): The organisation representing Indian doctors in the UK has obtained an emergency injunction against Britains health department directive stopping the recruitment of non-EU doctors who do not have visas to work beyond August 1.

 The court ordered that until the matter can be heard, inter partes on the morning of March 8, 2007, those HSMP (Highly Skilled Migrants Programme) visa holders whose visa falls for renewal before August 1, 2007, should not be excluded from interview and appointment process.

 Ramesh Mehta, president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, said: This is a small victory. The injunction is very focused.

 BJP bats for Ravan in contest with Ram

 Pathankot, Feb. 11: Here is an election the BJP is fighting against Ram in the name of Ravan.

 The reason isnt that the Pathankot Assembly constituency is close to Pakistan, a country that has been known to tempt the partys leading Ram bhakts, such as L.K. Advani, into baffling political somersaults.

 Its just that the BJP candidate, Master Mohan Lal, has been playing the role of Ravan for the local Dramatic Club for the last 35 years, and is readily identified in the area with the mythical Lanka king.

 Adding to the sense of an epic contest is the coincidence that Lals opponent and sitting MLA, Ashok Sharma of the Congress, has been the Krishna Natak Clubs choice for Ram for over 25 years.

 Being in rival drama troupes, they have never crossed swords on the stage over Sita. But the poll battle on February 13 will be the second time they face each other for a seat in the House.

 In the 2002 elections, Sharma had defeated Lal, then a cabinet minister in the Parkash Singh Badal government. The BJP candidate is urging voters to rewrite the local Ramayan this time.

 Be careful this time, and remember Ravan never touched Sita, Lal says at his campaigns.

 But can a BJP man really expect to praise Ravan over the legendary Ayodhya prince and still win? So, Lal has an Argument B: actually, hes the real Ram.

 You made a mistake in 2002 by thinking he (Sharma) was the real Ram. Look what he has done to the constituency. Look at the filth piled everywhere. He has tarnished the image of the Lord, whose character he has been playing for so long.

 Sharma, however, is confident that the results on February 27 will prove that Ravan can never become Ram. Lal is Ravan in real life, too. He failed to bring any projects to the border areas and that was the reason you voted him out. He will meet the same fate at Rams hands this time, he has been saying to loud applause.

 Praveen wife in threat cry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 12: Sarangi Mahajan, wife of Praveen Mahajan, today said she was threatened and manhandled outside court by strangers, suspected to be BJP workers. 

 Being a witness, I am not allowed to enter the court and hence have to wait outside. When I was sitting outside, two men asked me to get up. They held me and tried to push me aside. They said I had to vacate the chair for their boss, she said.

 Sarangi, who lives in Thane with her children, said she fears she will be harmed.

 Additional sessions judge S.P. Davare asked her to lodge a written complaint tomorrow. 

 The disclosure came a day after Gopinath Munde, Pramod Mahajans brother-in-law, told the court Praveen had sent the slain BJP leader a threatening SMS days before shooting his elder brother. 

 Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said this detail had not come up during the police probe. He told the court a probe will determine if Praveen had, indeed, sent such a message. The hearing has been adjourned to April 17.

 Now, there will be no more prayers or pleas. Now, there will be war and there will either be victory or an end to it all... Munde said, quoting the text message in Hindi.

 Munde said Pramod Mahajan, intrigued by the tone of the text message, had shown it to him and asked him to speak to Praveen. Munde spoke to Praveen the same day, but was told to stay out of the matter between the brothers.

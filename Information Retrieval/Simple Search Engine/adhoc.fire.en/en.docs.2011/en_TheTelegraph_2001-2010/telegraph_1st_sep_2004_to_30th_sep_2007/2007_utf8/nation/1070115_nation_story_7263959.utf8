 Dogs kill girl, glare on meat shops

 - Whos the real menace?

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Tasting blood?

 Bangalore, Jan. 14: A nine-year-old girl mauled to death by dogs in search of meat has torn Bangalore into two.

 The debate is, who are the real menace: stray dogs or the meat shops that throw leftovers about, turning street packs into meat-loving hounds?

 On one side is the Bangalore City Corporation (BCC), which had reacted with a war to hunt down and cull strays. One the other are animal activists, who have forced a partial retreat by the civic body even before its programme had gathered enough bite.

 Sridevi had been watching strays fight over scraps from a butchers last week when she was suddenly attacked. Within minutes, horrified residents watched her bitten, dragged and savaged to death.

 The corporation acted swiftly, picking up over 200 dogs and culling most of them, before animal lovers began protesting. Even the Kannada Rakshana Vedike, a body formed to protect the Kannada language, has trained its guns on the civic body.

 A rattled BCC has now decided to kill only problematic dogs strays that attack humans. Health minister R. Ashok is keen to also rid the city of illegal meat shops.

 These unauthorised shops dumping leavings illegally in open areas have given the stray dogs a taste for meat. As they could not find much meat that day, they went after the girl. I have directed the BCC to close such shops and kill all violent, sick and rabid strays, he said.

 The BCC has now put out advertisements. We like dogs but we are concerned about human safety, says the ad, explaining that after the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Act was passed in 2001, the civic body has let NGOs run a sterilisation programme.

 This year, of the 56,154 dogs, nearly 80 per cent have been sterilised and efforts are on to meet the target, it says. A 24x7 helpline has also been opened.

 Animal activist Sudha Narayanan argues the NGO sterilisation programme has brought down the stray population. The BCC is over-reacting after one girls death by catching and culling the dogs. It must focus on illegal meat shops and dumping of meat waste.

 Only violent and rabid dogs and those with incurable diseases will be put to sleep, shrugs civic commissioner K. Jairaj who, once bitten by a street dog during his morning walk, would have loved to go after the strays without mercy.

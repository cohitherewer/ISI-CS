 Amit again in temple row

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bachchan 

 Hyderabad, July 30: Controversy has followed Amitabh Bachchan into a temple again. 

 Andhra Pradesh endowment minister J. Ratnakar Rao has ordered an inquiry into allegations that the actor and his family were given VIP treatment at the expense of others at the Srisailam temple yesterday.

 I have asked the endowment commissioner to visit Srisailam and investigate. If the complaints are true, someone will face the music, Rao said on phone from Karimnagar.

 Bachchan offered prayers at the temple with wife Jaya, son Abhishek, daughter-in-law Aishwarya and Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh.

 On a trip to Tirupati a day after Abhishek and Aishwaryas wedding, special treatment to the Bachchans had landed the temple staff in trouble.

 Devotees at Srisailam had to wait longer for darshan because of the VIP visit. We were stranded in long queues for over three hours, said Krishnakumar, who had travelled all the way from Chennai with his family. 

 Shrine authorities denied protocol violations, but there were reports that some devotees had filed complaints. 

 Bachchan offered to contribute 8.5kg gold, worth around Rs 85 lakh, for the plating of a 12-foot-high Garuda pillar.

 We have come here to pray for our well-being and that of our people, not to stand for any prestige, he told temple officials. 

 Some might have fretted about the special treatment, but many among the devotees were only too happy to have Abhishek and Aishwarya in their midst and queued up for autographs from the couple.

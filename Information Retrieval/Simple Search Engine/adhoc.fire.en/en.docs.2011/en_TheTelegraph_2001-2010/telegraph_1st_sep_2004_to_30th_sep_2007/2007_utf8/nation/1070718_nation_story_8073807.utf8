 Want a gun licence? Sterilise UP farmer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, July 17: The Uttar Pradesh government today suspended a district magistrate who is reported to have revived an old family planning ploy of gun for sterilisation, sparking fear among poor farmers. 

 A spokesman for the state government said Gorakhpur district magistrate R.K. Goel has been placed under suspension for his alleged involvement in enforcing the policy.

 Under the 2004 policy, which the spokesman claimed was scrapped the following year, those who had applied for gun licences would get preference if they brought in volunteers who had agreed to be sterilised.

 People with influence, like primary teachers and affluent farmers, were told to find volunteers as part of Indias drive against population explosion. A rich farmer would thus have his application processed faster if he got five farm workers to go to a nearby clinic to be sterilised.

 But complaints started pouring in from labourers, who said they were not told about the nature of the operation they were being taken for.

 In October 2004, the policy triggered an uproar when five farmers in Lakhimpur-Kheri district were sterilised after being taken to a health centre by their employer.

 Sources said Goel was allegedly using the same policy to check the growth in population, a major concern for health officials in Uttar Pradesh, which is home to about 17 crore people more than that of Russia. 

 The district magistrate, however, said the health department of Gorakhpur was merely implementing the 2004 state government order, which had not been scrapped.

 We were ourselves looking into some complaints (of forcible sterilisation). Some farmers were complaining for they wanted more compensation, he added.

 One victim, Jagdish Verma, claimed he went to a health clinic in June this year because he was offered work at Rs 50 a day. The 30-year-old said he didnt know why he was taken there.

 I was taken to hospital and given a green pill, he said. I was told it would protect me from malaria. I dont remember anything else until I woke up the next day in pain.

 While the controversy has triggered a storm, many legislators are aware of the evils of a burgeoning population. Last month, some MLAs appealed to chief minister Mayavati to find out how many of her ministers have more than three children and strip them of their portfolios.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Lalji Verma admitted that the state was on the brink of a population explosion but said the government could not enforce coercive methods that violated the rights of people.

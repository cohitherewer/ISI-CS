 Huge mileage for vintage caravan

 From Volkswagen Beetles to Rolls-Royce Phantoms to Lambrettas and Harley-Davidsons, each several decades old, but running like a dream. They cruised down Delhi roads last week, offering a visual treat to vintage vehicle enthusiasts.

 It wasnt the first such show put out by classic car and bike enthusiasts, but one of the largest the capital has seen. In all, 110 cars and 23 bikes each a classic in its own right vied for attention from potential buyers, enthusiasts and the public. A 1920 Woolseley was the oldest car in the rally. 

 Diljeet Titus led the way, with his stable of 18 beauties, including Fords and Buicks of myriad varieties, some Cadillacs, Chevrolets, a Mercedes and a Pontiac. Titus, also the president of the Heritage Motoring Club of India, a growing group of vintage vehicle lovers, is a practising lawyer, but his passion lies in his cars. Ive always loved cars. These events bring classic car and bike lovers together, he says. 

 Stinging rebuke for CM

 Stately government buildings, with their colonial-style architecture, are often cool places for bees to set up hives. 

 The Vidhana Soudha, the seat of power in Karnataka, is no exception. Hundreds of beehives hang in all shapes around the building. Generally, the insects are harmless. But last week, a swarm of these stingers suddenly descended on a programme to mark the birth centenary of former deputy Prime Minister Jagjivan Ram. 

 Among the first stung were chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy and his deputy B.S. Yediyurappa. The chief minister was quickly driven away, but Yediyurappa and others were left to fend for themselves. 

 It appears that the bees were only making a point. Frequent official events in front of the Soudha, most of them noisy, might have been a source of disturbance, a scribe quipped. These include a series of sound-and-light shows and a fortnightly folk art festival.

 Flying eye hospital

 Akash Mathkar will have an eye operation, but it will be no ordinary surgery. The seven-year-old will go under the scalpel aboard an aircraft. The DC10 plane, known as Orbis, is owned by Orbis International, a global non-profit organisation working to prevent eye diseases.

 The plane landed in Mumbai on March 30, after a gap of eight years. About 45 surgeries are planned till April 10 in the worlds only flying eye hospital. Its next stop will be Syria.

 Dr Ahmed Gomaa, Orbis Internationals ophthalmologist, said Akash has exotropia in both eyes, a condition in which different pictures are sent to the brain. This causes a loss of depth in perception and binocular vision. A surgery is the only way to treat the problem.

 r G.V. Rao, country director of Orbis, said a campaign, called Right to Vision 2020, will be launched next month. The programmes will also have some celebrity shine: Actress and MP Hema Malini will participate.

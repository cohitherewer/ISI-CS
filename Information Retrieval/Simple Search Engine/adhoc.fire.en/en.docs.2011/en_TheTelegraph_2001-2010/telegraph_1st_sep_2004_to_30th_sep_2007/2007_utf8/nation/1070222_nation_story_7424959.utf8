 Amitabhs Nishabd in title tussle

 OUR BUREAU

 A scene from Nisshabd

 Feb. 21: Ram Gopal Varma, fighting a copyright war over Sholay, has a fresh headache. 

 Delhi High Court today issued a notice to Varmas RGV Film Factory, Adlabs Films Ltd and Super Cassettes Ltd over the title of the forthcoming Amitabh Bachchan-starrer Nishabd on a petition filed by the makers of another film by the same name.

 Kanungo Media Pvt Ltd has told the court that its film Nisshabd, cleared by the Central Board for Film Certification (CBFC) in 2005, has been screened at 14 film festivals.

 According the CBFC, the title cannot be used for the next 10 years. My film is yet to release commercially and I wouldnt want audiences to get confused with the similar-sounding title.

 Kanungo is releasing Nisshabd on March 16 while Nishabd hits the screens on March 2. 

 The films subjects are, however, worlds apart. Nisshabd is about a mans obsession with silence and Nishabd deals with an old mans obsession with a young girl.

 Verma and his co-producers have to respond by Friday.

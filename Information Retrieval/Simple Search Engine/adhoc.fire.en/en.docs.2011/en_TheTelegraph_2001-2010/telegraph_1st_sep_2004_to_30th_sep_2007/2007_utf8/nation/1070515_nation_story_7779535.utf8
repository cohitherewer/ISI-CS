 Bomai (Sopore), May 14: As he walked through a paddy field in his native village, his face caressed by a gentle breeze, Kania Lal felt he was back in heaven.

 The apple orchards were still there and he could hear the gurgling streams a little distance away. 

 When the guns started roaring in Kashmir, Lal had tiptoed out of his village one night, hoping against hope that one day he would return. Seventeen years on, he realised his dream had come true when he saw the sea of people moving towards him.

 They had come to welcome him back home.

 My people havent changed; they are the same. During the last two days, hordes of people have come to see us and we are very delighted, says Lal, a former manager with the State Roads Transport Corporation.

 Lal is among 15 others, including four women, all members of Kashmirs minority Pandit community, who have returned to their village to see if their homecoming is possible.

 If they do come back and settle down, they can thank Sopore legislator Haji Abdul Rasheed, who went from home to home in Jammu, where the Pandits have been living all these years, to make their trip to the Valley possible.

 Thank God, I finally succeeded in convincing them to come to their village, Rasheed says.

 The group is now busy visiting every nook and corner of their village. Seventeen years of neglect and subversion has turned their home into a virtual ghost village.

 I had the biggest house in my village which would stand tall among all other houses. Today, it is in ruins, says Pandit Bhushan Lal Bhat, the head of the group.

 Bhat went to a temple in adjoining Zinipora and was shocked to find it in a shambles. But I prayed there for our return, he says.

 When the group arrived, the entire village turned up to see them.

 Whenever any family was in grief in our village, I was the first to visit his house. We have shared both our grief and sorrow with our Muslim neighbours and they are again displaying their love for us, Bhat says.

 In the next few days, the group will go back to Jammu, but they all want to return here permanently. This is our heaven and we want to die here, says Veena, a 50-year-old who has come with her husband Hari Krishan.

 On their part, their Muslim neighbours are ready to welcome them with open arms.

 Our village had around 100 Pandit families and we will be happy if they come back, says Bashir Ahmad Ganai, a local shopkeeper.

 But homecoming may not be easy. Apart from the situation, there are some practical problems. Most of us have sold our property and some houses have also been burnt, says Bhat.

 Lal, like the others, wants employment for his two sons. I have three sons and only one is employed. The government should give them jobs so that we can settle here again, he says.

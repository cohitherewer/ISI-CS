 EC to scan Gujarat list for riot victims

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 30: The Election Commission today sent six central teams to poll-bound Gujarat to ensure that all those who lost or left their homes during the 2002 riots figured on voters lists.

 The term of the Gujarat Assembly ends on December 26 and polls are due later this year.

 The commission recently published the final electoral rolls for all the 182 Assembly seats in Gujarat.

 Sources in the commission said one of its major challenges is to ensure that all those affected by the communal flare-up find their names in the rolls. The commission has deputed six teams, each comprising two officials, to check various aspects of the electoral rolls in Gujarat, a panel spokesman said.

 The teams will visit all the 25 districts of the state for a week from today during which they would interact with district officials and civil society organisations.

 The panel had earlier launched a state-wide campaign to ensure that none of those displaced during the flare-up is left out of the revised list of voters.

 According to the revised electoral rolls, the total number of voters in the state is 3.65 crore, up by 10 per cent since the last elections were held in 2002. While males account for 1.88 crore votes, the number of women voters is 1.77 crore.

 Sources said the commission is thinking of making photo identification cards compulsory but has been able to issue such documents to 82 per cent of the voters so far.

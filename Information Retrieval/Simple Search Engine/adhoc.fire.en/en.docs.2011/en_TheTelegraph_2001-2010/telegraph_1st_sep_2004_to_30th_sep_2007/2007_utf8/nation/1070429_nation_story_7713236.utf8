 Talks on rebel safe passage 

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 New Delhi, April 28: India and Pakistan are discussing safe passage back home for militants in Kashmir, former prime minister of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir Abdul Qayyum Khan has said.

 Safe passage is under discussion, Qayyum said during a question-and-answer session here, pointing out that it is a good idea to have them back from Kashmir into Pakistan. They are an irritation, why keep them here? he added, smiling.

 This is not the first time Qayyum is visiting India, but the fact that his large delegation from PoK also includes a group from the Northern Areas (Gilgit, Baltistan) is unusual. However, the delegation has not been allowed to visit Kashmir.

 Denying the existence of any terrorist camp in Pakistan or PoK, Qayyum said President Pervez Musharraf should be given credit for dismantling them completely.

 The President should get credit for what he has done. Only he could do it. No one else could do it.

 As for demilitarisation, the PoK leader said the term is often applied only to the Indian part of Kashmir, but actually, both parts of Kashmir should be demilitarised. 

 However, demilitarisation would have to be accompanied by other measures such as free movement across the Line of Control and trade so that the borders between the two Kashmirs slowly become completely irrelevant, he said.

 Qayyum exhorted the audience, which included former RAW chief A.K. Dullat, former Jammu and Kashmir governor Gary Saxena and the Centres interlocutor on Kashmir, N.N. Vohra, to consider Musharrafs four-point proposal on a solution for Kashmir. 

 He pointed out that the tragedy of Kashmir over the last 60 years was that one or the other party always had objections to various proposals. 

 Musharrafs proposal today, he said, was much like the condominium (a territory in which two countries have equal rights) Sheikh Abdullah had offered when he came to Pakistan in the 60s but Islamabad had then rejected it. Today, India seemed to be doing the same thing, he said.

 The blame game, Qayyum said, should stop. Forget about a final solution. We have been discussing solutions for so long, but they havent happened. In the meantime, let us speak of processes, he said.

 Three new IITs on course for 2008

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 13: Three new Indian Institutes of Technology in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan are likely to be in a position to start classes as soon as next year, central officials have said.

 The state governments are trying to provide temporary accommodation and other facilities so that classes can begin even as the physical infrastructure at the actual sites is prepared, an official in the human resource development ministry said.

 The Planning Commission has approved funding for the three IITs under the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. 

 Bihta, 25km from Patna, and Kandi in Medak district of Andhra have already been identified as the sites for two of the IITs. Land has been procured at these sites by the state governments. 

 According to HRD ministry officials, the Japanese government has shown interest in assisting the Centre in setting up the IIT in Bihar, the home of Gautam Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, Japans most followed religion. 

 The site for the IIT in Rajasthan is yet to be finalised, the central officials said. 

 The HRD ministry has planned a funding of Rs 1,000 crore over a period of seven years for each of the three new IITs. 

 The sites for the new IITs are close to the state capitals. We have asked the state governments to find accommodation and other facilities in the capital cities, from where the IITs can start functioning while the construction of the physical infrastructure is completed, an official said. 

 A fourth IIT dedicated to design and manufacturing as opposed to engineering education has also been cleared by the Centre, and will come up in Tamil Nadus Kanchipuram.

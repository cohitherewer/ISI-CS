 Dravid pull amp; push

 Rahul Dravid at the camp 

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: This is one match where Rahul Dravid wouldnt be enjoying his time in the middle.

 The captain is caught in the middle of a shouting match between the Left and the Right, with a jibe thrown at Sourav Ganguly for good measure. 

 Dravid had attended a suryanamaskar camp in Nagpur a city he visits often to see his in-laws on January 20, a trip he must be regretting now for it has triggered an almighty political row. 

 First, the CPMs Brinda Karat advised the cricketer not to allow himself to be used by the sectarian Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. 

 The Sangh, which had organised the camp as part of ideologue M.S. Golwalkars birth centenary celebrations, was quick to hit back. It is not difficult to understand why the Left is attacking Rahul Dravid for attending a totally non-political event. They, too, get cricketers to visit their party offices. It is just that their ideology can attract cricketers only when they get dropped from the team, former Sangh spokesperson Ram Madhav crowed, in a jab at Sourav.

 Sourav often seen with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is, however, yet to pop into the CPMs Alimuddin Street headquarters. He has restricted himself to attending government dos.

 For that matter, even Dravid has let it be known he went thinking it was a yoga camp. As Nagpurs jamai (son-in-law) this is how BJP spokesperson Prakash Javdekar described him today it would be difficult for him to turn down an invite anyway.

 If he has any political leanings, Dravid has never made them public. That doesnt stop the Sangh and the BJP from claiming him as their own. Its a fact that suryanamaskar attracts the likes of Rahul Dravid, Madhav said. 

 Tarun Vijay, editor of the Sangh mouthpiece Panchjanya, though affected nonchalance. So what if Dravid did suryanamaskar? Where is the need to get so excited? 

 Dravid, who was figured in Panchjanyas pages advising all students to practise suryanamaskar every day to keep fit and healthy, might be asking the same question.

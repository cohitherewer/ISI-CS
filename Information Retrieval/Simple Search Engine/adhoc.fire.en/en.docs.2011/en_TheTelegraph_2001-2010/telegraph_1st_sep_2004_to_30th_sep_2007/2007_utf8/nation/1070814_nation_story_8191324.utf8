 Budhia coach in torture net

Bhubaneswar, Aug. 13: Budhia Singhs coach and guardian Biranchi Das was today arrested after the child levelled torture charges against him.

 Budhia, who became the toast of Orissa after his attempt to run 70km from Puri and Bhubaneswar in May 2006, went to Bargarh police station with his mother Sukanti to lodge a complaint. 

 I was slapped and hung upside down from a ceiling fan, Sukanti Singh wrote in the FIR quoting her five-year-old son.

 Sir (Biranchi) rubbed chilli powder in my eyes and poured cold water. He even branded my back and thigh with a hot metal rod, he said.

 Sukanti, a widow, said she learnt about the tortures on July 28.

 When I confronted him (Biranchi) on July 30, he misbehaved with me, she alleged.

 Sources said Budhia showed his injury marks to the police to substantiate the allegation.

 City deputy superintendent of police (crime) Sarat Sahoo said Biranchi was booked under Sections 506, 341, 323 and 294 (IPC) and 23 of the Juvenile Justice Act.

 The coach is now in judicial custody. 

 The inspector in charge of Bargarh, B.K. Patnaik, said the marks on Budhias body were clear, but appeared old. 

 The doctors at Capital Hospital, where Budhia was taken for medical tests, have said that the injuries were at least three months old.

 Biranchi said all this was a conspiracy and pointed to women and child development minister Pramila Mallick. 

 He also called Budhias mothers allegations false and said Mallick had provoked her. 

 How can I torture a child who I had picked from the gutter, adopted and developed as a marathon runner? he asked.

 He will return to me soon and fulfil dreams of becoming an Olympian runner.

 Das alleged that Budhias mother was peeved after he drove out her eldest daughter, a Judo trainee, because she had an affair with a man who stayed on the Judo Association premises. 

 Mallick said legal action would be initiated against Das on charges of torture.

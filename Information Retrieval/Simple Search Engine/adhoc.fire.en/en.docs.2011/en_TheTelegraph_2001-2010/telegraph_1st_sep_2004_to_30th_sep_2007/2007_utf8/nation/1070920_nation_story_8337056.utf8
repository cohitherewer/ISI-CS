 Maya duty salvo at Anils SEZ

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Sept. 19: The Mayavati government has accused the Anil Ambani group of stamp duty evasion in its SEZ plan, prompting the company to move court immediately.

 Noida SEZ Global Ltd, the company promoting the 1,200-acre enclave in Noida, approached the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court today but was told that the matter will have to be heard in the main bench at Allahabad.

 The rush to court came after the company was slapped with a notice about the alleged evasion, which the government says has caused it huge revenue losses. The SEZ has already been referred to the Centre for a review.

 In its petition, the company said there was no question of paying full stamp duty as the land was not handed over. 

 It signed the agreement with the Mulayam Singh Yadav regime on February 19.

 Reliance retail stores

 The Confederation of Indian Industry has urged Mayavati to allow Reliance Fresh stores, ordered to close after protests last month, to reopen.

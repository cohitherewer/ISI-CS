 Veggies, relax amp; bite into a Mars

 Vegetarians in India who had almost given up the idea of biting into their favourite Mars chocolate bar can take heart.

 Masterfoods Inc, the MNC that makes the bars, said it was reversing a decision announced last week to change its chocolate recipe to include trace amounts of rennet, a natural enzyme produced from the stomachs of calves which is used in cheese and chocolate making. The recipe tweak infuriated vegetarian campaigners, with MPs in the UK signing a protest petition. 

 There are three million vegetarians in the UK and not only did we disappoint them but we also upset other consumers. We have decided to reverse our decision, said Fiona Dawson, the MD of Mars snack food business in Britain.

 In India, similar groups had been silent, but the move wouldnt been swallowed easily. An average confectionery shop in Delhi sells about 15 to 20 Mars bars a day, a shopkeeper in the upscale Khan Market in south Delhi said.

 Jyoti spark at Karuna show

 Somnath Chatterjee has paid a handsome compliment to M. Karunanidhi he compared the five-time chief minister to his good friend Jyoti Basu!

 Addressing a special session of the Tamil Nadu Assembly to mark Karunanidhis 50 years as legislator, the Lok Sabha Speaker heaped praise on the DMK patriarch. 

 The MLAs and guests in the bedecked House sat spellbound as Chatterjee spoke about the 83-year-old Karunanidhis political career. Having held on to the chief ministers chair five times, the Speaker said, he had almost touched the record of my good friend Jyoti Basu.

 Karunanidhi thanked Chatterjee and said he was lucky that the Speaker had come all the way to Chennai to felicitate him. 

 By this time, the MLAs and the other VIPs had had enough of eulogies. So, immediately after the national anthem was played, they promptly got up to leave, without bothering to wait for the Speaker to be escorted out.

 Chatterjee, however, was in a generous mood and went around shaking hands with the handful who had stayed back.

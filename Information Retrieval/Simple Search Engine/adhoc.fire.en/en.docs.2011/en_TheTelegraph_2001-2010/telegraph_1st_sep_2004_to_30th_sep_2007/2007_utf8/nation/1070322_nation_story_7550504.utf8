The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Match result? A matter of math

 All worked out?

 While cricket fans are on tenterhooks over Fridays big game against Sri Lanka, seven Indians believe they already know the outcome. They are neither bookies nor an overconfident bunch within Team India. 

 A group of Mumbai-based IT analysts claims to have devised a computer model that can predict the outcome of cricket matches. Fractal Analytics Ltd, a consumer behaviour analysis firm, says it has a 70 per cent success rate.

 So who will win the India-Lanka match? Fractal wont tell as it has a deal with a newspaper that is publishing its predictions a day ahead of World Cup matches.

 But thats not why Mukesh Budania, who heads the Fractal project, will not be predicting who will be holding the Cup aloft on April 28. We hope to predict the winner of the Cup once the finalists are known, he said.

 But if the model, based on mathematical calculations from players past performances, can predict the result of every game, shouldnt he already know who would be playing the final?

 Budania avoids a clear answer but the reason is obvious. If you slip up over just a few of the early matches and, therefore, over who qualifies to the Super Eight and in what order, you could get your results from the semi-final onwards wildly wrong.

 Fractal has already tripped up over Indias first match was it because Bangladeshs teen heroes didnt offer enough past performances to go by?

 On the other hand, even though a Brian Lara or Sachin Tendulkar will give you hundreds of past innings to analyse, can any mathematical model predict they wont play a blinder to upset its calculations?

 A government statistician who didnt wish to be quoted said such individual performances are almost impossible to predict even with a lot of data.

 Besides, the model makes an assumption that players future performances will continue to follow the pattern of his past records.

 Its a gimmick, an academic was more forthright.

 Budania cites how his model takes into account data from 2,523 one-day matches. We analyse batsmens and bowlers performances in their last few matches and then compare this with earlier stages in their career when they were exhibiting similar form. Then we come up with a likely performance chart that helps predict the total scores of the teams.

 Its most famous prediction so far has been the defeat of Pakistan by West Indies in the Cup opener. Fractal says it correctly predicted the personal scores of Lara and Inzamam-ul Haq.

 The whole team in the office was jumping with joy when Lara got out for 37 and Inzamam for 36, Budania said.

 Where it faltered was in forecasting a tight victory the hosts won by 54 runs. After all, who wouldve guessed from past data that the Windies pacers would bowl just two wides?

 The model cannot predict dropped catches or run-outs or, for that matter, fixed matches, Budania admits.

 Fractal says its employees devised the model for fun after office hours. Retro-tested on the 2003 World Cup, it had a 70 per cent success rate.

 The team correctly called New Zealands surprise victories over Australia last month, but nobody trusted us then, Budania said.

 Fractal may market the software to sports companies or cricket boards. It will ensure the model ends up in the right hands, not (with) the bookies.

 Budania added that neither he nor his colleagues had placed bets. 

 Still, everything said and done, we hope to fail sometimes to keep the thrill of the last overs alive.

 As of now, crickets future as a game of glorious uncertainties doesnt seem under too much threat.

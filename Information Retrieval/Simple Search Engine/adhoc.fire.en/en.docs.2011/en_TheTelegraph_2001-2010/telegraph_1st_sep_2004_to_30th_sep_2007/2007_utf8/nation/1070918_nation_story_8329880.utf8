 Baalu fires a court salvo

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Sept 17: Shipping minister T.R. Baalu today came out with a personal statement claiming that the government would soon approach the Supreme Court to continue work on the Sethusamudram project.

 The government had last week sought three months from the court to consider whether an alternative route could be found for the canal without damaging Adams Bridge, which some call Ram Setu.

 Baalus party, the DMK, had gone on the offensive supporting the canal project, which is considered crucial to the uplift of southern Tamil Nadu. Baalu as well as his party boss and Tamil Nadu chief minister, M. Karunanidhi, had said Ram belongs to mythology.

 Government officials tried to distance themselves from Baalus statement, saying it was issued on his official letterhead and not through the governments Press Information Bureau. 

 Work on the project is stayed now by the court. Baalus statement said the government would obtain appropriate orders (from the court) to continue working in this region and is confident of completing the project at the earliest.

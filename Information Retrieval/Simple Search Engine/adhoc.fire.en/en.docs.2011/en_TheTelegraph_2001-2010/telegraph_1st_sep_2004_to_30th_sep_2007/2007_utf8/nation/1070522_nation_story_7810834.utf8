 Gender parity in rape verdict 

 New Delhi, May 21 (PTI): A court trying a rape case shot down the usual defence ploy of defaming the woman, arguing the same moral standards should apply to the accused man, too.

 The defence had cited the complainants admission of having slept with Gufran Mustafa, accused of drugging and raping her five years ago when he was a PhD student at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

 But judge S.P. Garg said, The acts of establishing physical relationship with the (woman) prior to the incident can equally be a reflection on his (Mustafas) character also.

 He sentenced Mustafa, who has completed his PhD and runs a cyber cafe near the JNU gate, to five years rigorous imprisonment.

 The 20-year-old woman was honest enough to admit the fact of her having established physical relations with the accused, the judge said. However, the said relations were made with her free consent and he had no licence to violate her privacy as and when he wished.

 Mustafa had had a steady relationship with the woman. But on October 12, 2002, he and a friend drugged and raped her. He then called up the womans sister and asked her to take the victim home from the Ramlila grounds.

 A first information report was lodged at the Vasant Bihar police station on October 17, and the two accused were arrested the next day. The co-accused, however, was acquitted as the victim refused to identify him as the other rapist.

 The prosecution proved its case with the help of 16 witnesses. They included the victims parents and her sister, who was regarded as an eyewitness since she had taken her sister home just after the attack.

 The court dismissed the defences suggestion that Mustafa had been falsely implicated by the womans father because he had refused to marry her.

 The judge said no father would stoop to bringing a false charge of rape involving an unmarried daughter just to take revenge on someone. 

 The defence plea defies human probabilities, he said. He noted that the marriage negotiations had broken down long before the rape.

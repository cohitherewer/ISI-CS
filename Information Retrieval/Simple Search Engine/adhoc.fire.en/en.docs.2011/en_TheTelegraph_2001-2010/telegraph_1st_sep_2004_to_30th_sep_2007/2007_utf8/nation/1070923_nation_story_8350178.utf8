 Devious route to arrest

 MUZAFFAR RAINA 

 Srinagar, Sept. 22: The Northeast militant caught last month in Kashmir would have taken barely a day to reach his destination but took a circuitous route across the sea and borders of three countries.

 Mohammad Sidiq alias Abu Waqar, a Lashkar-e-Toiba militant from Manipur, landed in police custody after he reportedly lost his way in Jammus Kathua district.

 The police have been trying hard to get information out of him but sources said Sidiq, the first Northeast rebel arrested in Kashmir, has been changing his statements. He initially said he is from Pakistan but then admitted he is a Manipuri.

 We are now in touch with Manipur police to check his antecedents, Jammu IG S.P. Vaid said. He is literate and in his early twenties.

 Sources said the police are trying to find out if there are more such youths willing to join militant ranks here.

 Vaid said Sidiq had volunteered to join pan-Islamic militant groups like al Qaida when he was being trained at a militant camp in Chittagong, Bangladesh. He told us that men from Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence visited the camp and asked the trainees who would volunteer for al Qaida and he expressed his willingness, the inspector-general added.

 But it is the route Sidiq took to join militant ranks in Kashmir that has surprised security forces. He told us that he first went to Silchar in Assam from Manipur and then crossed over to Bangladesh. He was then dispatched in a ship from Chittagong to Karachi, a police officer said.

 Sidiq, the officer added, left for Muzaffarabad from Karachi and took the treacherous route in the Machil sector on the Line of Control in Kupwara to enter the Valley. Some months back the Lashkar deputed him to Jammu province and since then he has been operating from there. He has admitted to his involvement in some militant attacks here.

 The sources said Sidiq has told interrogators that Bangladesh has emerged as a training ground for anti-India militants and that a number of youths from the Northeast were being trained in camps there.

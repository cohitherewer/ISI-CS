 Nandigram scars show

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 11: A blemish in Bengal seems to have scarred the CPMs performance in Uttar Pradesh.

 The twin constituencies of Ferozabad and Tundla, where CPM candidates were braving the fallout of the Nandigram killings, have gone to the Bahujan Samaj Party.

 Daulat Ram, the CPM nominee from Tundla, and Ferozabads Mukesh Yadav have got around 16,000 votes each.

 The BSPs Nasiruddin Siddiqui, who won from Ferozabad, bagged nearly 40,000 votes. Rakesh Babu, the BSP candidate from Tundla, did even better with over 50,000 votes.

 While the Samajwadi Partys Azim Bhai was the runner-up in Ferozabad, in Tundla, the second place went to BJP candidate Shiv Singh Chak. Both seats were earlier held by the Samajwadi Party.

 Ferozabad and Tundla are adjacent constituencies, where most people are bangle and glass workers. 

 The percentage of minorities is also very high there more than 30 per cent.

 The police firing in Nandigram had become a major talking point among workers in Ferozabad and Tundla. 

 The CPM lost all the 14 seats it contested, including Nazimabad in Bijnaur district and Meza in Allahabad, which it represented in the previous Assembly.

 Cellphone raid sparks jail riot

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, June 26: A drive to end the reign of imprisoned political and mafia bosses over Uttar Pradesh jails led to an uprising at one of them yesterday, killing two policemen and three inmates.

 Basti jail authorities knew that the prison had turned a pleasure hub for its star inmates but were unaware that the stockpiles in the wards included not only porn CDs, drugs and cellphones but firearms as well.

 For two hours, the jail resembled a battlefield with the prisoners and a huge police force firing at each other. By the time the rebellion had been quelled late in the afternoon, 11 people had taken bullet hits and several dozens had injuries from batons and stones.

 The jail officials had decided on the raid on Saturday when, as part of simultaneous checks at all state jails, they caught a Samajwadi Party district president, Ram Briksha Yadav, watching a blue film. Porn CDs and a player were seized from his cell.

 Prisoners with political connections are known to treat jails as their fief across the country. They enjoy the good life and run their gangs or party units from behind bars, even ordering assassinations of rivals over their smuggled cellphones.

 Saturdays checks had been ordered by chief minister Mayavati, who is eager to build an image as a tough administrator.

 Yesterday, when jail superintendent R.K. Mishra raided the wards and began seizing cellphones around 11 am, the inmates pulled out their guns.

 Beaten back under firing, Mishra rang up district police chief Ajay Kumar who arrived at the head of a large force. The prisoners, however, were ready: they had unlocked the barracks, chased the guards away, burnt furniture and records and lain siege to the jail.

 Mumbai/Pune, March 4: A midnight rave, doped cigarettes, a new drug the party had just peaked when some of the revellers revealed their true colours.

 By the time the undercover cops had finished, nearly three hundred youths had been taken into custody. Among them were eight foreigners and 27 women.

 The Pune rural police team, which joined the Holi rave in disguise based on information that a large group of youths had gathered for a party at a farmhouse 35 km from Pune city, seized contraband drugs worth Rs 5 lakh in the market. The haul included bottles of California Drops, the latest craze on campuses, marijuana and hashish.

 They (the revellers) were using drugs packed inside cigarettes, superintendent of police (Pune rural) V. Nangre Patil, who led the undercover team, said over the phone from Pune.

 The cops joined the party posing as students and danced to the trance music for about 15 minutes before revealing their identity. Our team surrounded the farmhouse and mixed with them. We went in at 2.10 am and, when the party was in full flow, we started the operation, Patil added.

 The police have also detained Ramdas Hagavane, the owner of the farmhouse in Dhankache, a village near Sinhagad fort; two drug peddlers identified as Dhruv and Parmeet who had supplied the contraband for the rave, and launched a search for a woman identified as Sania, an Ireland-based drug dealer. Police sources said they suspect the drugs came from an international syndicate.

 Patil said they came to know about the party from two websites which had specific information about rave and trance parties scheduled in different parts of the country. Most of the youngsters in our custody are students and IT professionals from Pune. But many of them had travelled specifically for the party from other parts of the country, including the Northeast, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Goa and Mumbai, he added.

 Today, the detainees were subjected to detailed medical tests. We need to take blood and urine samples before we investigate further. We will formally arrest them after the tests are over, and produce them in court tomorrow, he said. 

 The police had information that the revellers would use a bag of California Drops worth Rs 3 crore in the international market. Each drop of the drug costs Rs 800. We dont know the chemical combination, but the drug is called California Drops. We didnt find a bag full of this drug as our informants told us, but our searches will continue, Patil said.

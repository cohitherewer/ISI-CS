 Lion force for Gir

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedadad, April 9: The Gir Nature Youth Club, an environment group working for conservation of Asiatic lions, plans to embark on a yatra to raise a lion brigade.

 The Gir Chetna Yatra will begin sometime this month. We are working out modalities and logistics, said Amit Jethwa, president of the club.

 The yatra will cover about 200 villages within a 5-km radius of the Gir sanctuary the only abode of the Asiatic lion spread across the Junagadh and Amreli districts.

 The date for the two-week yatra, which aims at creating awareness on conservation of the lion, would be finalised soon, said Jethwa.

 The brigade, he said, would not seek assistance from the state government but cooperate with officials in their efforts to protect the endangered lions in the sanctuary.

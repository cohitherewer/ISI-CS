 Tax-free tag on Guru

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Feb. 6: If Amitabh Bachchan spends a crore and more on beta Abhisheks birthday, can Uttar Pradesh be far behind?

 A day after Bachchan Junior turned 31 in style driving off with fiancee Aishwarya in a Rs 1.7-crore Bentley Continental gifted by papa the heartland state has made his film Guru tax-free. 

 A cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav cited the healthy entertainment in the movie while issuing a tax-free certificate, the 16th in three years to a film starring one of the Bachchans. 

 Declaring a film tax-free costs the government anything between Rs 60 lakh and a crore if it is a hit, sources in the entertainment tax department said. 

 Uttar Pradesh had lost around Rs 1.5 crore a week on Bunty Aur Babli, a blockbuster starring Abhishek that was made tax-free, the sources said. 

 The figures for Guru could be similar. Co-starring Ash and based on Dhirubhai Ambanis life, the film is running to packed houses.

 But what are a few crores for the family? Late last month, Mulayam and party big gun Amar Singh chhota bhai to Amitabh had declared that Abhishek and Ash were the beta and bahu of Uttar Pradesh.

 At the Mirzapur programme where they made the announcement, the states Samajwadi rulers were only putting in words what they had already shown through action.

 In November, Abhishek received Yash Bharti Uttar Pradeshs highest honour, seen as a recognition of lifetime achievement. It didnt matter that he was not born in the state nor had lived there for a considerable time conditions for picking an awardee. Whether he deserved it is another question.

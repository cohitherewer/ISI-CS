 Next step in foreign role in retail

 - Sector-tied shops to sell 

goods of different firms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: Pressing ahead with its shelf-by-shelf approach, the Centre is planning to allow foreign direct investment in sector-specific retail such as electronics and sports goods.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath said here today that with FDI in single-brand retail already being allowed, it is now time to move on to sector-specific retail.

 He said sector-specific retail would necessarily be multi-product in nature as sports goods such as tennis racquets and cricket bats were manufactured by different companies.

 Although Nath said multi-product, his reference to goods made by different companies has raised the possibility that the government may allow such shops to sell products of many brands.

 Until now, only single brand FDI has been allowed with nine proposals having being cleared. These include one by fashion house Louis Vuitton and a Mitsui proposal for selling high-end Toyota products. 

 Another three proposals are under consideration, including one by the coffee chain Starbucks.

 If multi-brand foreign-owned stores are allowed to be set up, it will be a landmark decision. The Left parties, which support the government from outside, have already made known their opposition to any such move. 

 Multi-brand stores will also help companies like Reebok and Adidas, which have merged globally but are operating as different units in India, to become a single entity here and sell their products from common outlets.

 Nath said the government was drawing up a policy to woo both foreign and domestic investors in organised retail as the segment has a huge potential to employ school and college dropouts that constitute the bulk of the unemployed youth.

 The minister said the government was keen to move very quickly on the issue and the commerce ministry would be ready with the policy very soon. 

 He said FDI was being opened up in specialised goods and would create more employment. There are no kirana stores selling such goods and hence there was no question of such investment displacing local employment.

 The minister said organised retail was the second revolution in the making after the information technology sector and was growing at the rate of 36 to 40 per cent.

 Releasing a report, the minister said India has the potential to add over Rs 200,000 crore turnover in organised retail by 2010, which would generate employment for some 2.5 million people.

 B-schools, Arjun set up peace date

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Ahmedabad, April 19: The six IIM directors will meet Arjun Singh and his officials in Delhi tomorrow to defuse the tension over the timing of the admissions list.

 It is likely that the B-schools will bow before the human resource development ministrys hard stance and decide not to announce the general category list on Saturday.

 The ministry has made it clear it will not agree to the general list being released without the Other Backward Classes list, which is caught up in a legal tangle. The Supreme Court, which has stayed the OBC quota, will on Monday hear the Centres application for removal of the stay.

 The Indian Institutes of Management had a week ago written to the ministry, proposing that the general category list be released on April 21 without waiting for the court decision. 

 But hours before the letter was sent, IIM Ahmedabad director Bakul Dholakia jumped the gun and announced the date, angering the ministry.

 Dholakia may not find too many among his fellow IIM directors backing him at tomorrows meeting. The director of the Lucknow institute, Devi Singh, has criticised Dholakias unilateral announcement of the date, saying: No one had mandated him to speak on behalf of (all) the IIMs.

 The two biggest IIMs, Ahmedabad and Bangalore, are understood to be the most eager to release the general category list. Calcutta, next in the pecking order, appears to have taken a softer line.

 The three smaller IIMs Lucknow, Indore and Kozhikode are believed to be the most placatory towards the HRD ministry, which controls their purse strings. Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta dont depend on government funds any longer.

 Even many faculty members on the Ahmedabad campus are believed to be unhappy with Dholakias hasty move, which they say came without proper consultation.

 The ministry has turned up the pressure on Dholakia. A senior official from Delhi is now camping in Ahmedabad to dissuade the B-school from declaring the general list on Saturday.

 Never before had the ministry sent a bureaucrat over to pressure an IIM not even during Murli Manohar Joshis tenure as HRD minister when he and the B-schools had fought a bitter autonomy row.

 Sources said the ministry is so unhappy with Dholakia that it would not hesitate to arm-twist his institute. But the Ahmedabad B-school, like the others, is expected to toe the government line. 

 The IIMs, however, fear this may drive the best students into the arms of private business schools. Well end up losing the cream, an official said.

 Whatever the outcome of the meeting, both the Centre and the B-schools will be in a tricky situation if the apex court dismisses the governments application on Monday.

 Dholakia could not be contacted today. Institute spokesman Ashok Shah said the director would meet the media on April 21. Right now, he is busy preparing for tomorrows meeting in Delhi.

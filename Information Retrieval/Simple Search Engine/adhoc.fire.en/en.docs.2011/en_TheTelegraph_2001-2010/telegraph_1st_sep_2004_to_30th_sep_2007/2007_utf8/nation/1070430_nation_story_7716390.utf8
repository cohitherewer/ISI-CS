 Tobacco plea

 Mumbai, April 29 (PTI): A bidi manufacturer has challenged in Bombay High Court a rule that requires any tobacco product to have a warning about health hazards occupying at least 50 per cent of the display area of the package.

 Section 3(1)(b) of the Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labelling) Rules, 2006, says the warning must occupy 50 per cent of the display space, protesting which M.S. Walekar, manufacturer of Ghoda Chhap bidi, said it is unreasonable.

 Walekar has also questioned the requirement that a skull-and-bone sign and pictorial representation of hazards associated with tobacco consumption should be a part of the statutory health warning.

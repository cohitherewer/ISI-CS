 Molest twist to Briton murder

 - 40-year-old father of two found hanged in Maharashtra village

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 2: A British tourist was found hanging in a jungle near Roha, 120 km south east of the Maharashtra capital.

 The body of Stephen Bennett, 40, a father of two from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, was found by locals in Malsi village on December 12. He had been on a weeks holiday in India and was supposed to be home for Christmas.

 Post-mortem reports suggest Stephen was murdered. 

 He was hit on the head by a log and then strangled with a saree, after which he was hung from a tree. We identified him through his passport that we found in his pocket, said Vikram Patil, investigating officer of Roha police station.

 Four locals have been arrested in the case and have confessed to murdering Stephen, but they claimed they did so because the holidaymaker tried to molest the wife of one of them. 

 Two other accused are still absconding.

 According to police, Ramesh Maruti Mane, one of the accused, has alleged that Stephen tried to molest his wife when she stepped out to relieve herself around 5 am on December 11. Mane, along with his brother and four others, first beat up Stephen and then strangulated him around 5.30 am. 

 The four were held on December 14.

 Stephens father, C. Bennett, said from Leckhampton: It is too soon for us to talk about Stephens death. We are still very shocked. He just went on holiday and this happened. 

 The family has no idea why he was in Roha. Stephen lived alone in Cheltenham. His two children live with his former partner in Cornwall. 

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in London last night that it had not been told whether any of the men had been charged. 

 All we know is that Indian police are treating the death as murder, though we have no information as to why he was in such a remote place and what the possible motive could be. We are liaising with the police and other authorities in Mumbai so that we can inform the family, a spokesman for the British police said.

 Roha is an industrial town, on the Konkan Railway line, with a population of 90,000. It is 20 miles from Murud Janjira, well known for its long, white sandy beaches. 

 Bennetts murder occurred less than two weeks after the killing of another Briton. 

 Mike Blackey, a 23-year-old charity worker from Burnley, was battered to death in Dharamshala, the home of the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama, on November 28. 

 His body was found hidden under a pile of stones in a stream. 

 A tea-stall owner arrested in the case later alleged that Blackey had been making advances towards his wife, who is a British citizen and works as a manager with an Edinburgh-based non-government organisation in Dharamshala.

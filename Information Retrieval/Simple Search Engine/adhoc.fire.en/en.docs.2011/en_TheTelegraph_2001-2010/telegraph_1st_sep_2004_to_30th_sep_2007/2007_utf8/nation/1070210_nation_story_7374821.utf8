The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Indian firm in UK lottery race

 AMIT ROY 

 London, Feb. 9: In what could prove to be an even more dramatic story than Tata Steels takeover of Corus, an Indian company, Sugal amp; Damani, is challenging the incumbent, Camelot, for the right to run Britains multi-billion National Lottery for a period of 10 years.

 Applications to the UKs National Lottery Commission closed today, with only the two bidders in the field.

 The winner of who runs Britains lottery, which has been in the hands of Camelot since the start in 1994, will be announced by the end of August this year.

 Then will follow a transition period before the new licence holder takes over on February 1, 2009.

 Camelot can and will argue that it has done a good job until now and so there is no reason for change.

 On the other hand, Sugal amp; Damani will want to ride the India wave and say it will run the lottery better, raise billions more for good causes, create many more millionaires and generally offer a much improved service.

 In order to qualify, Sugal amp; Damani will need to maintain an office in the UK, something currently not listed on its website.

 As things now stand, Camelot should win but nowadays anyone who has studied the Lakshmi Mittal and Ratan Tata adventures would be foolish to discount an Indian bid.

 Out of the UKs 60 million population, 70 per cent of those above the legal age of 16 spend on average 3 a week on the National Lottery in the hope of becoming multi-millionaires.

 There have been two licences awarded since 1994, both to Camelot.

 In a statement today announcing its bid for the third licence, Sugal amp; Damani said that the company enjoys being in a competitive situation, given its track record of thriving under true competitive scenario the Indian marketplace. With 37 years in the lottery business and by far the largest lottery operator in India, Sugal amp; Damani has complete hold over all the technological aspects of the modern lottery business and feels confident that it has done a good job as far as the bidding process goes.

 It added: Technology happens to be the key decider due to significant technology focus in the years to come and Sugal amp; Damani is well poised with its in-house development centre in India, the most happening place for technology development in the world. It is confident of making a significantly high contribution to good causes, the key mandate for UK National Lottery.

 The statement also pointed out: Being present in almost all major states of India during various license terms of different state governments, Sugal amp; Damani has exposure to markets of continental proportions, with cultural and linguistic diversity as varied as Europe. The success of Sugal amp; Damani comes from its philosophy of engaging with the local talent.

 It added: Several strategic partners, domain leaders in their individual field of business in UK, have pledged their support to make the bid truly competitive.

 The National Lottery Commission, which governs the way the licence is awarded, said it was committed to a fair, open and transparent process, designed to attract high quality, credible bids to run one of the most successful lotteries in the world.

 Since the lottery business is now global, its staff had travelled the world in search of the best bidders.

 The commission has laid out clear and transparent evaluation criteria and warned that if bidders do not meet the seven required standards, their bid will fail regardless of how much money is proposed for good causes.

 Among the criteria, there would have to be propriety in respect of employees, suppliers and contractors, corporate governance and fit and proper testing, financial soundness, and application of cutting edge technology.

 Robert Foster, commissioner and chairman of the project board responsible for overseeing the competition process, said: This competition is all about raising as much money as possible for good causes through innovative games. This is whilst ensuring the National Lottery is run with propriety and players are protected. We are pleased to have received two bids that have been prepared in a highly competitive environment, and it is clear that both bidders have put in an immense amount of work to submit these bids.

 He added: Our job now is to get on and evaluate their proposals so that we select the operator who can deliver as much money as possible for good causes.

 Camelot said that it had submitted a pioneering third licence bid with a series of proposals designed to create more winners, maximise returns to the good causes and ensure that it remains a world beater in the next licence period.

 Since 1994, it had raised 19 billion for good causes, it stressed.

 One factor which ought to help Sugal amp; Damani is that a high proportion of lottery forms are filled out in countless Indian-owned newsagents and grocery stores.

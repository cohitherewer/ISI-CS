 Filmdoms advice to Saif: Slow down

 SUBHASH K. JHA

 Saif and his mother Sharmila 

 Mumbai, Feb. 21: Amitabh Bachchan blames Saif Ali Khans chest pain on overwork and would like the fine lad to slow down. But mummy will hear none of it.

 Possibly the most relieved mother in the world at the moment, Sharmila Tagore said her 36-year-old son was absolutely fine and needs to work to his optimum once he is given the all-clear by doctors.

 I dont think what happened to him had to do with overwork. For a man, its very important to keep working. Ive seen many people at my age languishing away for lack of work. I dont want that to ever happen to him. Saif needs to work to his optimum. So no, I wont ask him to slow down, she said.

 Although there had been rumours about Saif having suffered a massive heart attack on Sunday, Sharmila said tests proved the chest pain had been triggered by exhaustion.

 To be on the safer side, he has been administered medicine. Hell be kept under medical care for a couple of days one more day in the ICU, she explained.

 Much as the begum would like Saif who has aced as Shekhar in Parineeta and Langda Tyagi in Omkara to keep working, she would, however, want him to go slow on silent killers like smoking and indiscipline.

 Ill certainly ask him to stop smoking. Also to exercise and follow a disciplined lifestyle. Beyond that, no one can predict these things.

 If there was one thing she was overwhelmed by, it was the support Bollywood had shown since her sons illness. There had been plenty of visitors and good wishes to pep up Saif, she said.

 Saif is very happy. He has got a get-well card from Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Yash Chopra has been calling up. Everyone has been supportive because what happened to Saif was so shocking. Thank God, its all clear for him.

 Among the earliest visitors was superstar Bachchan, who was at an awards show with Aishwarya when the news broke.

 We went immediately after the show to see him. He looked fine and cheerful. I told him he must slow down. Its disturbing to see such a fine lad this way.

 Bachchans Baghban co-star Hema Malini had the same advice for Saif: take it easy.

 I know that isnt easy. Even if you feel the need to slow down, no one here lets you. But Saif has to get selfish about his well-being grab time (for himself), find some peace and quiet, she said.

 Younger actors like Urmila Matondkar, Arshad Warsi and Dino Morea, too, said Saif should look after himself better. But they were unanimous that Saif was in his prime and needed to use this time to move ahead.

 Id like to remind Saif that hes going through one of the best phases in his career. He needs to take it to greater heights. And for that, he needs to be in good health. He should take the warning and look after himself, Urmila said.

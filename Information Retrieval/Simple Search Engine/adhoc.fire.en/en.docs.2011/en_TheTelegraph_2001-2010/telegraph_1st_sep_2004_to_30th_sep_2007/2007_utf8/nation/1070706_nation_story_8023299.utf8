 Singh stinger

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 5: Manmohan Singh has asserted that the UPA-Left is not apologetic about Pratibha Patil and has touched a perceived raw nerve in L.K. Advani.

 Asked how he felt about Advanis description of him being a hand-picked Prime Minister of Sonia Gandhi, Singh paused, and then said: I feel sorry for him just because he has not realised his ambition to become the PM. But he has not realised the significance of the dignity of his office (as the leader of Opposition). It is not my fault.

 In his first unequivocal defence of Pratibha, attacked relentlessly by the BJP-led NDA, the Prime Minister said: We have chosen an outstanding candidate who has been in public life since 1962. For 25 years, she was in the state legislature and for 18 years she was a minister. She was deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha and a governor later. I dont think she compares unfavourably with other occupants of the presidential office.

 Singh, speaking to women journalists at his residence today, played the gender card, too. Women in our country face difficulties when they assume the role of working women. I am satisfied. The charges against Pratibha cannot be sustained. We are not at all apologetic.

 Asked to respond to the BJPs charge that she protected her brother in a murder case, Singh said: You should ask the BJP why the father and wife of Haren Pandya (the Gujarat MLA killed in mysterious circumstances) named certain political leaders. What have they done about it?

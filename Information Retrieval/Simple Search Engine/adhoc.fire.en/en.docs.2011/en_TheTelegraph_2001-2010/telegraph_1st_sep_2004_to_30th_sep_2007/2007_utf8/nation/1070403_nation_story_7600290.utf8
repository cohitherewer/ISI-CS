 SC calculator ruling

 New Delhi, April 2 (PTI): In a setback to students with learning disabilities, the Supreme Court today stayed a Bombay High Court order permitting the use of a calculator by one such student who was appearing for his Class XII board examination.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan stayed the order on a plea by the Central Board of Secondary Education.

 The high court had permitted Abhilash Kumar, who has a learning disability, to use a calculator for the mathematics paper on the ground that he did not need a writer now. He was earlier given a writer and extra time for his Class X tests.

 Former additional solicitor-general Altaf Ahmed, who appeared for the CBSE, opposed the use of the calculator saying it would provide the student with an additional advantage as it could overtake some mental functions. According to him, the high court had failed to appreciate that students were required to acquire specific skills called instructional objectives during secondary school examinations.

 He further stated that facilities were being given to physically-challenged candidates for making good the deficiencies and bringing them on a par with normal candidates.

 The effort of the CBSE is to integrate the children with special needs with the main stream in such a way that they are treated at par with other candidates once they pass the CBSEs examinations for purposes of employment and also by the institutions for higher learning, the board had said.

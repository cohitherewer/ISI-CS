 Rickshaws to go off Delhi soon

 New Delhi (PTI): Cycle rickshaws may soon be off Delhis major roads as city planners are trying to restrict the non-motorised transport system to residential areas only.

 The planners have proposed that cycle rickshaws should ply within residential areas only and not on major roads as it was an unsafe mode of travel in the fast-moving traffic.

 A proposed master plan for Delhi said unlimited and unrestricted use of this mode has a direct relationship with migration into the city and the phenomenon of clusters and slums.

 There are also plans to build fully segregated cycle tracks along select traffic corridors with provision for safe parking in parks.

 Damages for road death

 New Delhi (PTI): A year after a 30-year-old man was killed in an accident, a Delhi court has asked Oriental Insurance Company to cough up Rs 4.04 lakh as compensation to his family. 

 Motor accident claim tribunal judge Pratibha Rani directed the insurance company, with which Dalip Kumars scooter was insured, to pay the amount with 6 per cent interest from the date of filing the petition.

 On March 26, 2005, Kumars scooter skidded off the road near Keshopur bus stand, killing him on the spot. 

 Shakuntala, his mother, had filed a petition in December 2005 and sought a compensation of Rs 5 lakh, citing the death of her only son who was giving her financial support.

 Sealing impact

 New Delhi (PTI): Over 20,000 shops operating out of residential areas in Delhi were sealed during last years drive, which traders claimed caused a loss of Rs 600 crore.

 Minister of state for urban development Ajay Maken, however, said the government has no authentic information on the impact of the drive. 

 Self-sacrifice

 Bahraich (PTI): A 45-year-old man slit his throat with a knife to sacrifice himself at the shrine of Ghazi Baba in Uttar Pradeshs Bahraich on Id-ul Zuha. A note found on Moharrum Ali said he once dreamt of Allah asking me to offer myself for sacrifice.

 Babri panel

 New Delhi: The Centre has extended by three months the term of the Liberhan commission, which is probing the Babri mosque demolition. The panels findings will show if the demolition was pre-planned or spontaneous.

 The export of zari work and zari products to the US has grown by 82 per cent from Rs 52 crore in 2004-05 to Rs 94.79 crore in 2005-06. Their demand has grown in Italian markets as well.

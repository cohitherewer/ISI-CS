The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Muckraking, Maharaja Mac-style

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 22: The whiff of scandal that has just spiced up the presidential poll today invites inevitable parallels with the comparable contest in the US. Parallels with the US are in fashion this season. 

 If the US presidential poll is cheesy staple, like McDonalds, Indias has got richer. Like Maharaja Mac. 

 To wit: both India and the US have women contesting for the post of President. The contest in India is for a post that is largely ceremonial. In the US, the November 2008 poll is about electing the most powerful man/woman on earth. Both Pratibha Patil and Hillary Clinton would be Presidents, if elected. 

 Pratibha was ferreted out of a desert state by the UPA-Left. Hillary is a former Presidents wife and always a national public figure. Pratibha is likely to outrace Hillary because the schedule in India is more immediate. 

 But over and above the parallelism of gender, the Indian presidential contest is catching up also in the culture of the competition in the US, where the race for the top job is almost always accompanied by muckraking. 

 The allegation that the Congresss best Patil since Shivraj has been left by the wayside has been shielding a murderer brother is still only word of mouth. 

 There is little evidence that has been admitted in court. But the fact that it should surface means the contest for Rashtrapati Bhavan is getting more earthy. It helps make the presidential poll a little comprehensible. The allegation of murder in a presidential poll in India is like the allegation of illicit sex in a presidential poll in the US. 

 In 1988, Democratic nominee Gary Hart was bundled out of the race after The Miami Herald took up his challenge come and follow me around, youll find it boring and put two reporters to stake out his Washington DC town house. 

 First, they snapped a pretty woman entering and leaving the place. Five days later, the newspaper front-paged Donna Rice, her bathrobe exposing the thighs, on the lap of Hart on a yacht named Monkey Business. 

 In Calcutta, they almost christened the citys busy southern crossroads at Gariahat after the candidate who cried out of the race. It just illustrated how big the issue had become. 

 Then, in 1996, there was the Whitewater campaign. And it could still be raked up. The Clinton couple were alleged to have invested badly in real estate development in south Arkansas. They lost the money. Bill won the election but because Hillary is still around, friends of their Democrat colleague, Senator Barack Obama, still talk about it. 

 US history sheets and blogs even list a sex scandal that goes right back to Thomas Jefferson. Not surprising because the US presidency is four times older than the Indian. But India is catching up with the country that never had a king or queen. 

 Maharaja Mac.

 Chatroom con lands in jail

 Maliha Ramu, Gayatri Joshi 

 Singapore, March 20 (AP): A Singaporean woman was sentenced to six months in jail for luring an Indian engineer in an Internet chatroom with pictures of a young actress and taking nearly US $45,000 from him with promises of marriage, a newspaper reported today.

 Maliha Ramu, a 36-year-old ethnic Indian woman who was married, was found guilty yesterday by a Singapore court on two charges of cheating Bharani Indran of $45,000, The Straits Times reported. 

 The newspaper said she pleaded guilty.

 Ramu met Indran, a 32-year-old Indian software engineer based in the US, on a Yahoo chatline in September 2004, the report said. She sent Indran pictures of actress Gayatri Joshi, pretending these were her pictures. 

 Soon Ramu started asking Indran for money and between November 2004 and March 2005, he transferred $45,000 to her account. But he later became suspicious and informed police.

 Ramu was arrested in August 2006. Her lawyer Rudy Marican told the court his client was a charity worker who used the money to help needy people, the newspaper reported. 

 The Straits Times said Ramu has returned more than $37,000 to Indran.

 It quoted her Singaporean husband as saying that he had no idea what his wife was up to until the police came to their house to arrest her.

 I was shocked that they could think that she was an offender. She has a kind heart and is always helping others, the husband, who declined to be identified, was quoted as saying.

 Yechury stand on N-plants

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 8: CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury today said he was opposed to nuclear power stations as they were being eyed as potential customers by US firms that stand to benefit from the deal signed with the Bush administration.

 Yechurys comment, made at a DYFI meeting where US-bashing was a pet theme, came a day after Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told the same youth wing that a nuclear power station was among his priorities.

 Bengal is trying to build a nuclear power station at Haripur in East Midnapore. Officials of the Nuclear Power Corporation have told the chief minister they liked the site. 

 American companies are looking for new markets. The Indo-US deal is meant for that, Yechury said. 

 He later said it is the Centres decision to set up plants in states. No state government has the locus standi to decide where to set up a nuclear power plant. It is entirely the Centres business.

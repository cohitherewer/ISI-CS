 Advani on offensive over CD 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 6: L.K. Advani was defiant today in the face of the Election Commissions threat to de-recognise the BJP over an anti-Muslim CD in Uttar Pradesh.

 He said criminal prosecution has been initiated against BJP chief Rajnath Singh for an offence that amounts to nothing more than an oversight. The complaint echoed the partys old argument that Muslims are treated with kid gloves while Hindus are persecuted.

 One oversight, and they lodge an FIR against our president. With what moral authority does the Congress attack us? None of us have forgotten the kind of garbage the Congress officially released as campaign material in 1984. What have these parties done except appeasement to build votebanks in the last 30 years? Advani (in picture) asked.

 The BJP plan is clear. It will distance itself from the objectionable CD to avoid further legal action, but will use Rajnath Singhs prosecution to gain electoral mileage.

 In its reply to the poll panels showcause notice, the BJP insisted it was not responsible for production or distribution of the CD. The panel says the party has violated Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968. It can be punished with de-recognition.

 The CD was not part of the official campaign and wasnt even produced by it, the party said, adding some individuals put the disc in the campaign material kit without the knowledge of senior leaders. The CD hasnt been seen or approved by the BJP leadership, the party said in its reply to the commission.

 Returning to attack the Congress, Advani said: There were advertisements, pamphlets in the run-up to the 1984 election that openly incited communal violence. The target at that time were the Sikhs. Such a party has complained against us to the Election Commission.

 Advani also took a swipe at Rahul Gandhi over his statement that a Gandhi would not have allowed the demolition of the Babri masjid. It exhibits a warped mindset that believes that only one family is fit to rule India, the BJP leader said.

 The Samajwadi Party pounced on the troubled BJP with its general secretary Amar Singh calling it the Bharat Jalao Party and sensing a chance to cosy up to Muslims.

 Advani, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Rajnath Singh should come out on the streets and apologise to Muslims. Simply de-recognising the BJP as a political party is not enough. They owe them an apology, he said.

 Gambit to send doer message

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sonia

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: On the face of it, the odds were stacked against the Congress in Delhi and Lucknow when it embarked on Operation Topple Mulayam.

 The Left Front was dead set against it, the Samajwadi Partys expected pullout (announced this afternoon) has put the UPA on a razors edge in the Rajya Sabha and increased its dependence on the CPM and its allies in the Lok Sabha.

 Nobody can say for sure if President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will ratify the proposed presidential ordinance and even if he does, if the Supreme Court would regard it kindly considering that it struck down a similar order the UPA imposed on Bihar in 2005.

 In Lucknow, the Congress was reduced to 16 legislators in the Assembly after innumerable splits and defections from its original strength of 25. The partys bravehearts are not prepared to bet on more than 50 in the next elections. The organisation has to get its act together despite Rahul Gandhis blueprint and nobody is sure who will be projected as its leader because, as a state leader put it, our stakes are not that high.

 So why did the Congress put itself out to such lengths to advocate the dismissal of the Mulayam Singh Yadav government? To the extent that Sonia openly intervened with the Left and the UPA allies, including Sharad Pawar with whom she hardly shares a rapport.

 In the past, whenever a major political operation was on, the Congress president was barely visible, save for her presence at the Friday Club meetings of the core committee.

 For instance, when the Supreme Court pulled up Jharkhand governor Syed Sibtey Razi for giving the UPA the first shot at government formation, even as the numbers game looked shaky, it was projected as a goof-up of Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and Ajit Jogi, who oversaw affairs in the state, and the Raj Bhavan. 

 When the court passed strictures against the Bihar Assembly dissolution, former governor Buta Singh was singled out as the villain. 

 If at all Sonia played her hand, it was on pro-people issues like the rollback of oil prices or pushing through an amendment in the criminal procedure code to protect witnesses in the aftermath of the Jessica Lal murder trial.

 On Uttar Pradesh itself, her interventions were confined to general criticism of the government. She didnt make a single personal remark against Mulayam or his general secretary Amar Singh.

 The views on Sonias role depend on who the person is: if it is a Congress member, they are gung-ho about the prospective dismissal, barring notable exceptions. If the person is part of the government, the opinion is laced with caution.

 But everybody is agreed on one factor: once the high command has decreed that action has to be taken, it has to be complied with. Congress sources said the main political reason was to enhance Sonia and Rahuls profile in their backyard as doers in the mould of Indira Gandhi.

 A former MP said: There was always a sense of restiveness among the workers at the Congresss support for Mulayam, more so after he kept splitting our legislature party.

 He added that the Congresss refrain was as soon as the Supreme Court verdict came, the party would do something. By the time it came, the state government was so thoroughly discredited that Mulayam would not have got any mileage by dismissal. For us, the main consideration was that our workers should be able to move around freely during elections. They were getting thrashed by Samajwadi activists, he said.

 Sources said the personal element in Mulayam and Amars anti-Sonia and anti-Rahul tirades was too strong to be ignored. The constant presence of the Bachchans at their public appearances was seen as a deliberate strategy to spook the party, given the personal relations Bollywoods first family once had with the Nehru-Gandhis.

 Army smells rat in gold scam

 SUJAN DUTTA 

 New Delhi, July 14: Indian peacekeepers alleged to have trafficked in weapons for gold in Congo may be victims of a political game among troop-contributing countries to the UNs largest military mission, officials in defence headquarters here suspect. 

 The defence headquarters have flatly denied allegations that Indian peacekeepers with the UN mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo are involved in trading weapons and rations for gold. 

 A UN audit from Nairobi, Kenya, was reported to have found evidence that Indian peacekeepers were involved in swapping UN rations for contraband gold. 

 India has a brigade-plus strength in Congo four battalions (nearly 3,600 troops), three air force aviation contingents with helicopter gunships, doctors who run a Level III hospital and military observers. They form the backbone of the Monucs 17,000 troops. 

 Reports from Nairobi have alleged that Indian peacekeepers trafficked for gold with Hutu rebels in Congos Nord Kivu province, the group the peacekeepers are there to disarm. 

 A senior Indian Army official monitoring UN deployments even insinuated that the allegations surfaced because an Indian Army major general has been selected to command a division under Monuc. Major General Bikram Singh is likely to take over next month as the commander of a force that comprises Indian and Pakistani peacekeepers among troops from other countries. 

 We have talked to our senior commanders including our brigade commander, Brigadier Bahl, and we have learnt there is nothing of the kind happening, the official said. 

 Defence minister A.K. Antony is scheduled to visit Indian peacekeepers in Congo and Sudan in August. 

 Reports suggested that the UN audit had found evidence of trafficking by peacekeepers in 2005 and 2006. A Pakistani officer was said to have been stripped of his rank for trading in weapons and sent back. Soldiers on a UN mission can only be tried in their home country for illegal practices.

 The reports suggest there could be differences among peacekeepers from different troop-contributing countries. But the sources wouldnt say if differences between Indian and Pakistani peacekeepers were the cause of the mudslinging.

 Ladies protect Jyoti honour

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jyotiraditya Scindia

Shivpuri, June 5: The Congress has broken a jinx in Madhya Pradesh and Jyotiraditya Scindia has preserved his honour, all because of two ladies.

 A sulking Yashodhara Raje Scindia and a vengeful Uma Bharti have unwittingly helped the Congress bag Shivpuri, the first Assembly byelection the party has won since the BJP came to power in the state.

 The victory of Virendra Raghuvanshi from Shivpuri is a shot in the arm for Jyotiraditya, who had campaigned hard in his pocket borough over the past few weeks.

 Raghuvanshi won the seat part of Jyotiradityas Guna constituency with a margin of 7,781 votes over the BJPs Ganesh Gautam. Narendra Birthare, of Uma Bhartis Bharatiya Jan Shakti party, cut into the BJPs votes.

 The byelection became necessary after the BJPs Yashodhara Raje Scindia resigned the seat on her election to the Lok Sabha from Gwalior in March.

 Stakes were high for Jyotiraditya, who had made the bypoll a prestige battle. Until a month ago, the BJPs Gautam was a Congressman and Jyotiradityas political agent.

 Yashodhara had been nursing a wound after the BJP ignored her supporters and picked Gautam, who she sees as an outsider. Not long after the BJP decided to field him, she went to the US to be with her son Akshay Bhansali.

 But her detractors within the party say Yashodhara wanted a dummy nominee to keep the seat warm for Akshay. The New York-based VJ has made several trips to Shivpuri amid speculation that he is looking for a political role on the Scindia turf. 

 The Congress was quick to dub the victory a vote against the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government, saying people were fed up with the BJP rule.

 Congress spokesperson Manak Aggarwal said: It is a verdict against the BJP.

 The BJP refused to accept the outcome as a mandate against its government. There were several factors, including the Gujjar agitation in Rajasthan, that affected the result, a party spokesperson said.

 The Uma camp claimed success, too in creating trouble for the BJP. Uma had campaigned extensively for her candidate.

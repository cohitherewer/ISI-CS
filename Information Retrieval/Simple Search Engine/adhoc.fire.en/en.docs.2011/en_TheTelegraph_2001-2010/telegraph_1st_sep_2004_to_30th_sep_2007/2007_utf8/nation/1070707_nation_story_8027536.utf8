 Dead FCI official calls family

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ram: Dead or alive?

 Guwahati, July 6: A man claiming to be P.C. Ram called his family in Ghaziabad to say he was safe and well, within 24 hours of Ulfa claiming the FCI official was not dead.

 Police quoted Rams befuddled son Pravin as saying the man whose call he took around 4.15pm today sounded quite like my father. 

 Pravins sister Nirja confirmed that her brother did receive a call from a man whose voice was like their fathers. She said he sounded as if he was not well. 

 Ram had been abducted from Guwahati by Ulfa in April and a body dug out of a pit last weekend was identified as his by Pravin and cremated. As many as 22 people, including Rams colleagues and his adopted daughter June Murmu, had identified the body.

 A senior police officer involved in the investigation into the abduction and murder said the man who said he was Ram spoke to Pravins mother Padmavati and Nirja, too. Both, he said, were almost convinced the voice on the line was indeed that of the FCI executive director.

 The voice told the family they should not worry about his diabetes as his abductors had arranged for some kind of medical treatment. 

 Ulfa claimed yesterday that the body that was dug out from a pit on a riverbank in Baksa district last week was that of an army informer. 

 The latest twist in the tale has forced the police to opt for a DNA test of nail and skin samples retained from the body confirmed as Rams.

 Additional superintendent of police Rajen Singh said Rams family requested a DNA test, too, after hearing of Ulfas claim. A member of the special investigating team will be leaving for Hyderabad for tests at the Centre for DNA Fingerpinting and Diagnostics.

 Pravin confirmed that he requested a DNA test to be certain that the body was his fathers. 

 G.P. Singh, the deputy inspector-general of police in charge of the central western range, said Ulfas claim was nothing more than a ploy to keep criticism at bay for as long as possible. 

 He recalled that the militant group had employed the same tactic after the abductions of Sanjoy Ghose and Russian engineer Sergei Gritchenko.

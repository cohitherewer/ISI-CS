The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Standoff unites motley front

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 20: The standoff between the Left and the Congress-led government on the nuclear deal seems to have given the United National Progressive Alliance a new reason to stick together.

 The third front, which failed to work as a group during the recent presidential election, called a hurried news conference today to announce its support for the Left parties on their opposition to the Indo-US deal.

 It also sought parliamentary approval on the agreement. 

 We are in touch with the Left parties, said Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh, whose party is a third front constituent. They (the Left parties) have said the sense of the House should be taken on the deal. This is the best way. 

 Telugu Desam Partys Yerran Naidu and ADMKs V. Maitrayan stood by Amar. 

 Branding the nuclear deal a slave treaty and a unilateral decision taken by the government, the UNPA demanded a joint parliamentary committee to look into the matter. 

 The government has said the treaty has been ratified by the cabinet, which is a handful of people picked by the Prime Minister. But since in a democracy like India the Parliament is supreme, the deal should be ratified by both Houses, Amar said. 

 It is disgusting to see how the government unilaterally moved ahead with the deal on the behalf of the country. The deal, in its present form, was a slave treaty, he said. 

 The government should immediately set up a joint parliamentary committee to look into the matter. 

 The Centre should also include Opposition leaders, scientists and patriots, like former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in the panel that the government yesterday hinted it would set up, the Samajwadi Party leader said. 

 The third front MPs were the first today to force adjournment in the Rajya Sabha, which saw six such breaks. 

 As soon as the Upper House assembled, the UNPA leaders were on their feet. They demanded that question hour be suspended and the nuclear deal be taken up for discussion. 

 The NDA and the Left parties, who are equally opposed to the deal, allowed the UNPA to run the show. 

 As if extending the NDAs support to the third front, BJP member Murli Manohar Joshi said the UNPAs demand was justified.

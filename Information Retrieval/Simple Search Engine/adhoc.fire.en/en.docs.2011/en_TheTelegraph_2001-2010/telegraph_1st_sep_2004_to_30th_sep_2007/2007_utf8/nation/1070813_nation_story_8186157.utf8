 Taslima makes pupils of cops

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Aug. 12: For the past couple of days, Andhras crime-busters have been busy with something more intellectual.

 Senior Hyderabad police officials have been poring over Taslima Nasreens novels and poems, with help from hired Bengali teachers, to find out if her writings are blasphemous.

 Majlis-e-Itahadul-Musalmeen legislator Akbaruddin Owaisi had levelled that charge when he said the exiled Bangladeshi author would be killed if she sets foot in Hyderabad again. The threat was made on Thursday, hours after three other MLAs of his party led a mob attack on the author.

 The police have asked translators to flesh out the provocative sections in Taslimas writings so that these can be produced in court later. 

 Akbaruddin had filed a case against the author on Friday for promoting ill will between religious groups.

 City police chief Balwinder Singh said Taslima may be summoned to Hyderabad to depose. Video clippings of her earlier public speeches are being scanned for remarks against Islam.

 To show they are moving against the trouble makers, too, a case was registered against Akbaruddin on the charge of criminal intimidation under Section 506 of the Indian Penal Code. 

 No action has been taken against Akbaruddin, MIM founder Sultan Salauddin Owaisis son and the leader of his party in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly, since he made the threat. The case was lodged late last night after the police approached a local magistrate at his home with video clippings of Akbaruddins utterances.

 Deputy commissioner of police N. Madhusudan Reddy said the magistrate accepted the clippings in which the legislator said agar dubara woh Hyderabad aayi, to sar kaat denge (Taslima will be beheaded if she comes again).

 No permission has been sought for Akbaruddins arrest, though another magistrate has been asked to clear the way for a case to be lodged against Barkatullah Khan and Majidullah Khan Farhat. The two men, leaders of the Majlis Bachao Tehreek, had said Taslima would have been killed on Thursday if the Musalmeens amateurish attack hadnt upset their plans.

 We sought the courts nod to register a case against Tehreek and begin investigations, said a senior police official. 

 There has been no move so far to register a case or arrest the leaders of Dasgah-e-Jehad-Shaheed, which took out a procession last morning chanting slogans against Taslima.

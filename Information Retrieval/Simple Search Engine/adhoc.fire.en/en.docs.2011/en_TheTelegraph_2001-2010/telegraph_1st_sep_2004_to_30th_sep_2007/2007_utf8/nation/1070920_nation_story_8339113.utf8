 Lanka voice in canal row

 Chandrika: Channel worries 

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: In the sound and fury over the Sethusamudram project, the concerns of one affected party seem to have been consistently ignored by Delhi.

 An environmental study that Sri Lanka presented to India in May has said dredging operations as well as subsequent passage of ships through the deepened Palk Strait channel could have a negative impact on the island nations maritime environment.

 So much so that it could eventually destroy the sensitive and fragile marine ecosystem located between the two countries.

 Sources from Sri Lanka told The Telegraph former President Chandrika Kumaratunga conveyed Colombos concerns to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh after the ship channel project was cleared towards the end of 2004.

 A multidisciplinary technical group was then set up with the Indian delegation being led by officials of the shipping ministry to go into the concerns of both sides. Three meetings have since been held, the last in April 2006.

 We are now hoping that India will soon agree to a fourth meeting so that we can also study the outcome of the environmental study commissioned by the government, the Lankan sources said.

 They added that Colombo was privately jubilant over the controversy the project has triggered, as a result of which dredging operations had come to a halt.

 The Lankan study says the project is located barely a kilometre within Indias maritime boundary and, therefore, its impact was not likely to remain within the Indian side of the boundary. It criticises the project document and says the environmental assessment carried out was inadequate for several reasons.

 First, the study says, the design for the channel hasnt been planned in a way to minimise the impact. Second, the modelling studies carried out by India needed to be backed by better field data.

 Third, the volumetric exchange of water across the Adams Bridge caused by the creation of the canal as well as dispersal of sand and fine sediment during dredging havent been studied.

 Colombo was also concerned about the possibility of oil spills in the area.

 The Indian studies have not taken into consideration a single environmental impact on the Sri Lankan side of the international boundary, the study says. This is most important, it emphasises, as the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay lying between the two countries are unique and biologically rich areas linking two large marine ecosystems.

 The Lankan sources said right from the beginning, India has insisted there would be no environmental impact on Lanka because of the way the channel was being constructed. 

 However, they added, India could not answer questions on who would compensate for the environmental costs, if any.

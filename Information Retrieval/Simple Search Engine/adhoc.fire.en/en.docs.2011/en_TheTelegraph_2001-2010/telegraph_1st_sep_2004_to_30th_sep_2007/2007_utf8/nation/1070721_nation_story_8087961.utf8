 Target India in British power game

 London, July 20: Britain wants to gang up with America against India at least, that is the interpretation that may be put on a curiously phrased line in an important speech by David Miliband, promoted at the age of 42 by Gordon Brown to the exalted position of secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs. 

 After two of his ministers had appeared to suggest that Britain, with Brown as Prime Minister, would not be as close to America as it had been under Tony Blair, Miliband has spent much of his time striving to repair the damage. 

 In a speech, New diplomacy: challenges for foreign policy, at Chatham House in London yesterday, Miliband stressed that the US would continue to remain the UKs most important ally. 

 But in the process he made an odd remark about India which will need some explaining. 

 He said that over the next two decades, with the growing strength of China and India, we are likely to see political, economic and military power more geographically dispersed than it has been since the rise to global dominance of the European empires in the 19th century. This makes our most important bilateral relationship with the United States more, not less, important. 

 The reference to China is not difficult to understand. Although Britain is keen to do business with China, the most aggressively rising economy in the world, the communist country is still viewed as a threat in foreign policy terms. 

 But why Miliband considers a closer relationship with the US necessary to counterbalance a rising India is less easy to understand unless he is taking his cue from Brown whose utterances on India have sent out mixed messages. 

 If Britain can work with the US to solve world problems, why not with India, analysts will want to know. 

 Possibly Miliband, who has risen fast in British politics some might think a little too fast may claim later in future speeches that his comment on India has been misunderstood or taken out of context. 

 On relations with the US, he has had to work hard to repair the damage caused by two of his ministers. 

 Lord Malloch Brown, foreign office minister, told The Daily Telegraph in an interview it was time for a more impartial foreign policy and to build relationships with European leaders. 

 Malloch Brown, who used to be deputy secretary-general at the UN and is a known critic of the Iraq war, said: It is very unlikely that the Brown-Bush relationship is going to go through the baptism of fire and, therefore, be joined together at the hip like the Blair-Bush relationship was. 

 In another speech, Douglas Alexander, international development secretary, warned against unilateralism and called for an internationalist approach to global problems. 

 Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell has called on the UK Prime Minister to get a grip. What is at issue is not the relationship with the US but the nature of that relationship, he said. Under Tony Blair, the relationship was so subordinate as to appear subservient. Britain needs to be Americas candid friend, not its client.

 Spying stick for minister aide

 New Delhi, Feb. 7 (PTI): Shakeel Akhthar, the private secretary of Union minister of state for home S. Reghupathy, has been repatriated to his parent cadre in Tamil Nadu for allegedly violating service rules.

 Akhthar, a 1989 batch IPS officer from Tamil Nadu, was reverted to his parent cadre after he came under the intelligence scanner, sources said.

 Although the home ministry has been keeping silent on the issue and terming Akhthars transfer a routine one, the sources said he had been shunted after intelligence agencies spotted him with some officials of a western mission here.

 The sources said Akhthar had allegedly been in touch with the western diplomat for some time and had not informed either his superior or the cabinet secretariat about these meetings.

 Akhthar, who was sent on deputation to the Centre on August 13, 2004, has been posted as deputy inspector general, Kancheepuram, on his return. 

 Normally, deputation at the Centre lasts four to five years but in his case, it was cut short after two years and five months. 

 Later, in a clarification, the home ministry said the officer had sought a transfer to his parent cadre on his own, and that the request was accepted by the minister.

 Tiger link in tea-man arrest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 27: In a probe that could dig out information about LTTE sleeper cells in the city, a Tamil Nadu police team will visit Mumbai to question a suspect held for allegedly supplying ball bearings used in explosives by the militant outfit.

 Versova police today arrested 42-year-old tea-seller Miraj Saheb Ismail on suspicion that he had helped in the purchase of at least five tonnes of ball bearings from the metropolis.

 The resident of Goregaon sold tea and coffee on a bicycle at night.

 Earlier this week, Chennai police had caught five Sri Lankan refugees with suspected links with the LTTE and seized a huge consignment of ball bearings.

 The police suspect the ball bearings were being smuggled into Tamil Nadu to be ferried to Jaffna, the stronghold of the banned LTTE, which is locked in a bloody conflict with the Sri Lankan government.

 Investigations also revealed that the consignment was sourced from Dadar in central Mumbai.

 Ball bearings are a key ingredient in improvised explosive devices and act as splinters, maximising the impact of a blast, police officials said.

 Additional commissioner of police (western region) Bipin Bihari confirmed that a police team from Tamil Nadu was likely to arrive in Mumbai within the next two days.

 We have picked up Ismail on information that he had been helping two or three persons in procuring the ball bearings, the officer said.

 We will have to cross-check details regarding Ismail with Tamil Nadu police. His exact role would be clearer only then, he added.

 Intelligence sources said the LTTE has developed a network or sympathisers and sleeper agents in the city over the years, and has a base in Dharavi, Asias biggest slum, which has a large pocket of Tamil settlers.

 Chennai police had on Tuesday intercepted a consignment of two tonnes of ball bearings loaded on to a truck at a travel agents office and arrested four Sri Lankan Tamils.

 On Wednesday, the police arrested 33-year-old Sivakaran alias Shankar, a resident of South Eralia in Jaffna who had been staying at the Mandapam refugee camp in Tamil Nadu since 2000, and seized three tonnes of ball bearings.

 Their interrogation revealed that they had obtained the ball bearings from Mumbai, had travelled to Chennai via Tiruchy and were planning to ferry the consignment to LTTE-controlled areas.

 They were arrested under the Explosives Act and remanded in police custody till February 9.

 Aussie baby bombshell out of bag

 OUR BUREAU

 July 17: Mohammed Haneef is being detained in Australia because he chatted online with second cousin Sabeel Ahmed about the birth of his daughter three days before the failed bombings and took a 300 (Rs 24,000) loan from his brother Kafeel to sit a medical exam three years ago.

 The details are contained in documents Canberra used to justify cancelling his visa, which stopped him from being freed on bail.

 Haneefs lawyers today released the documents, provided to them by government officials, to show that the case against him was extremely weak and said they would appeal the visa withdrawal in the federal court tomorrow.

 Immigration minister Kevin Andrews, who cancelled the visa, said the doctor would be deported once legal proceedings were over.

 But 25-year-old Firdous Arshiya demanded an honourable return for her husband. He should not be seen as a suspect and deported to India, she said.

 We want him to be absolved of all charges as he is not a terrorist and in no way involved in terrorist acts. I do not want people in Australia and elsewhere to see him as a suspect. I want him to return an honourable man.

 Haneef was arrested on July 2 and later charged with providing reckless support to a terrorist outfit by giving his mobile phone SIM card to Sabeel a suspect, like Kafeel, in the failed UK terror plot in 2006. But a magistrate granted Haneef bail, saying police had shown no link between him and the plot. 

 Before he could be freed, the government cancelled his visa and ordered him detained under immigration laws in a decision that has sparked outrage in Australia.

 For Gods sake, explain to Australians why you have taken this course of action, said Peter Beattie, the Queensland premier.

 Haneefs lawyers delayed applying for bail pending the visa appeal because that would mean him being moved to the immigration detention centre in Sydney. Defence lawyer Peter Russo said a member of the public had offered to pay the A$10,000 (Rs 3.5 lakh) surety required for Haneef to be granted bail. 

 In Delhi, Australian high commissioner John McCarthy was summoned by the foreign ministry, which asked why Haneefs visa was cancelled.

 Firdous said the government would have to put more pressure. If he comes back with charges still sticking to him, it will be a disgrace not only to him but to the country.

 Most of the information released today was known. His last contact with Sabeel was on June 26, the day Haneefs wife gave birth to a baby girl, the documents said. His last chat with Kafeel, who allegedly lent Haneef 300 in 2004, was in March or April.

 My clients computer had been 95 per cent interrogated and the best that they could say was that he chatted online and he had these two conversations, said Haneefs barrister Stephen Keim. 

 If they had information that was condemnatory of my client why would they only charge him with recklessness?

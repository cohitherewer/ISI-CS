The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cycle peace mission punctured

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 2: When it comes to an Indo-Pak peace drive, the car seems to have an edge over the cycle.

 On March 31, two peace rallies came face to face at the Wagah border. 

 One, a fleet of cars that has traversed all the Saarc countries coinciding with the south Asian summit in Delhi was returning from a successful trip to Pakistan. 

 The other was a group of nine cyclists who had pedalled all the way from Mumbai in the hope of taking a peace message across the border. But they were left nursing a heartbreak when their visa applications were rejected.

 As reported in The Telegraph, the cyclists students and corporate executives had been on the road since the beginning of March and reached Wagah on March 31. 

 We were sure we would get visas. After all, both the governments are talking about greater inter-people relationships, said Dhananjay Madan, the team leader.

 The visa hurdle came the cyclists way even as Pakistan prepares to use the Saarc forum to complain about India allegedly not granting enough visas to its citizens. 

 How does one explain this? At the border when we spoke to those travelling in the cars, they told us how they hardly interacted with ordinary Pakistanis. Its good they went, but why were we refused? asked Rupali, one of only two girls in the group. 

 The team, however, does not think its 2,000-km trip to Wagah has been a waste. Weve met thousands of people, and most of them want lasting peace between the two countries. Its a message which needs to reach across the border, Rupali said.

 And carry the message they will. Well apply for visas again. We will definitely go to Pakistan, Rupali said.

 FIR salve on raped duo

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Tamluk, March 17: The East Midnapore administration is set to lodge a formal case of rape after the two alleged victims got their statements recorded last night.

 The women, brought from a Nandigram hospital to Tamluk last evening, were today visited by BJP leaders L.K. Advani and Sushma Swaraj, who promised them that the guilty would be brought to book.

 A 25-year-old resident of Gokulnagar and a 27-year-old woman from Kalicharanpur had told doctors at Nandigram yesterday that they were raped by policemen during the melee following the Sonachura firing on Wednesday. They were referred to the Tamluk district hospital for tests as the Nandigram hospital lacks the required infrastructure.

 I recorded their statements last night and am filing an FIR in Tamluk police station. We had ordered medical tests on both the women yesterday, said Tamluk sub-divisional officer Nilanjana Dasgupta. 

 The women were examined by a gynaecologist and underwent medical tests at Tamluk hospital late last evening. 

 Doctors, however, said it might be too late and crucial evidence might have been lost as 48 hours had elapsed after the crime. 

 Prime facie, one of them has injuries on her chest, which may corroborate the rape charge. Or, it could also have been caused by the police lathicharge. As for evidence from clothes, she had already changed before getting admitted to the Nandigram hospital on Thursday, said a doctor. The other woman had taken a bath at the Nandigram hospital yesterday and changed her clothes, he added. 

 In their statements before the magistrate, both women have accused policemen of raping them. 

 Both women burst into tears as they recounted the incidents to Advani and Sushma, when they visited the Tamluk hospital later this afternoon.

 Please give her justice in your report, Sushma told the attending doctor. Turning to one of the women, she said: Dont worry. Well get the guilty punished.

 Advani asked one of them if she had children. I have three daughters. They are alone at home with my ailing mother-in-law. With me away, there is nobody to look after them. I want to go home, she said. 

 Asked why she did not report the rape on the day of the crime, one of the women said she had been shamed into silence. However, when the pain became too much to bear, she got admitted to the hospital on Thursday afternoon.

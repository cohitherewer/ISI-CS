 Delhi molest case stuck

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 25: The Delhi University students who alleged they were molested by aspiring constables were not helping identify the suspects, police claimed before court today.

 Delhi police said they had procured footage from closed-circuit televisions installed at various spots on the campus but were not able to pick up the molesters as the girls were refusing to identify them.

 The complainants are not cooperating with investigations, police counsel Mukta Gupta told Delhi High Court, which was hearing a victims PIL seeking a judicial inquiry.

 Between September 15 and 19, girls from DUs Indraprastha College and two other student groups had complained of molestation by candidates sitting an exam to become police constables at a nearby venue.

 Most of the girls are emotionally scarred. We are preparing them for the identification, but the manner in which the police have behaved makes it very hard for the girls to trust them, a student leader of Indraprastha College said.

 The police registered FIRs allegedly three days after the last of the molestations was reported. This violated a Supreme Court order that sexual harassment complaints were to be immediately considered, Sugriv Dubey, a lawyer for one of the victims, claimed.

 The girls said the police had reportedly been contacting them directly for the identification, disregarding DUs harassment cells and its administration.

 They had also been far from helpful when the girls went to lodge complaints, a victim said. This police insensitivity had bred a fear that was holding the girls back from going for the identification, she added.

 They asked us questions which were so insensitive and embarrassing. And there were no women police at the police station. It is hard to appear before the police again, a girl said.

 The high court dismissed the PIL for a judicial inquiry, saying it saw no reason to intervene at this stage. The magistrate of the lower court hearing the case could personally monitor the investigation, it said.

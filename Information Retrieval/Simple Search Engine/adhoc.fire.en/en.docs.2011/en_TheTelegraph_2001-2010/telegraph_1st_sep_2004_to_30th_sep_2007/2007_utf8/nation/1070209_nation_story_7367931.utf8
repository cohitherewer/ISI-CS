 Mehbooba pulls security stunt

 MUZAFFAR RAINA

 Srinagar, Feb. 8: The abduction of her sister had led to one of Delhis worst capitulations to Kashmir militants. But Mehbooba Mufti isnt afraid of the rebels when it comes to pulling a political stunt.

 The Peoples Democratic Party president today slipped past her Z-plus security and travelled a long distance into her militancy-hit constituency all to embarrass ally and Congress chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad.

 On Monday, all PDP lawmakers had offered to surrender their security after Azad dared them to do so before seeking withdrawal of troops and the special powers given to them in the state.

 To make her point, Mehbooba today accompanied senior PDP leader Ghulam Hassan Mir, the tinted windows of her vehicle hiding her, to Ashmuqam village in Anantnag district without her security and returned unharmed.

 The escapade comes 17 years after Mehboobas sister Rubiya Sayeed was kidnapped by militants soon after the VP Singh government came to power in Delhi towards the end of 1989. The Centre, with Mehboobas father Mufti Mohammed Sayeed as its Union home minister, freed four militants in exchange for Rubiyas freedom.

 The move has remained controversial, with the VP government accused of making a distinction between VIP and ordinary hostages, and of encouraging the rebels.

 Today, Mehbooba said: We feel there is a change in the security situation and there is no need for (special) laws (such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act) or more securitymen.

 The securitymen on duty had to face the music. They have been reprimanded and are likely to face action, a police officer said.

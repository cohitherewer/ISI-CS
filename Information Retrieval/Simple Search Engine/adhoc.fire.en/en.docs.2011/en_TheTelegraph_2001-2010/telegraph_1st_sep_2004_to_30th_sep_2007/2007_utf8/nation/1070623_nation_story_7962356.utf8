 Rushdie clashes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Srinagar, June 22: Violent protests broke out in Srinagar today against knighthood for Salman Rushdie as shops and offices remained closed in response to a strike called by a militant group. 

 Police and protesters clashed in Srinagars old city. People took to the streets after Friday prayers to protest against the decision, raising slogans against the US, Britain and Rushdie. 

 The police wielded lathis and used tear gas to disperse the mob, which retaliated by pelting stones on them, their vehicles and the Nowhatta police station. 

 Earlier, moderate Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq told a Friday congregation that knighthood for Rushdie was a deliberate attempt by Britain to hurt the sentiments of Muslims. Tension is simmering in the Valley with Kashmirs top cleric Mufti Bashir-ud-din calling for the execution of the author.

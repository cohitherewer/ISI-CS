 Gujarat admits fake killing

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, March 23: The Gujarat government today admitted in the Supreme Court that its police had killed an innocent man in a false encounter in 2005, wrongly accusing him of plotting to kill chief minister Narendra Modi.

 Sohrabuddin Sheikh was shot dead by Gujarats anti-terrorist squad on the outskirts of Ahmedabad. His wife Kauser Bano has been missing since then.

 The police had claimed that Sohrabuddin was an activist of the Lashkar-e-Toiba and wanted to assassinate Modi to avenge the death of hundreds of Muslims in the 2002 riots.

 It was a false encounter, senior counsel for Gujarat K.T.S. Tulsi today told a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan. Senior police officers are involved. We are prepared to take immediate action.

 He said the inquiry was in progress and sought four weeks to submit a detailed report, which he was granted.

 The apex court had on Monday issued a notice to the Gujarat government asking it to explain the circumstances in which Kauser Bano went missing.

 The police had earlier said Sohrabuddin was killed in a joint operation by Gujarat and Rajasthan police.

 The Supreme Court took up the case after Sohrabuddins brother Rubabuddin accused top police officials, including the then chief of the anti-terrorist squad, D.G. Vanzara, of staging the gun battle. In his petition, he had sought a CBI probe.

 A report prepared after an inquiry by a police officer of inspector-general rank contradicted the police theory, additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanian had told the court.

 The police had alleged the encounter took place while Sohrabuddin was on a motorcycle but the report suggested he was picked up from an inter-state bus while travelling from Andhra Pradesh to Gujarat via Rajasthan, he said.

 Subramanian had said the inquiry report was based on the statements of some passengers of the bus.

 The state government told the Supreme Court today that all steps would be taken to provide protection to Rubabuddin, who has allegedly received threats that if he did not withdraw the petition, he would be branded a militant.

 We will give all protection to him even if he is outside the state, Tulsi said. Rubabuddin stays in Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh.

 Another petition pending before the court alleges that Gujarat police killed 21 terror suspects in fake encounters between 2003 and 2006. The court said it needs more details before entertaining the PIL.

 Trai snub to channels

 New Delhi, July 9 (PTI): Delhi High Court has upheld the jurisdiction of telecom watchdog Trai to regulate the broadcasting sector and fix terms and conditions of agreements, including fixing tariffs for channels.

 A bench Justices Vikramjeet Sen and J.P. Singh passed the order on two separate petitions filed by STAR India and another channel challenging the authority of Trai to regulate the broadcasting sector.

 Rejecting the broadcasters arguments, the court said: The contention that the inclusion of the broadcaster in the definition of service provider of the Trai act is ultra vires is summarily rejected.

 quot;The fixation of tariffs by the authority (Trai) is within their competence even with regard to broadcasters, the bench said, adding that market forces cannot be allowed to decide tariffs. 

 It also upheld Trais power to fix terms of agreements between broadcasters and between service providers.

 Mumbai, Aug. 3: Suhasini Nair was waiting for two hours for a train to take her home to Navi Mumbai where three-year-old Astha was waiting for her.

 But the 35-year-old, who had left for work at 9am and usually gets back by 6 in the evening, appeared stuck as heavy rain crippled the train network that is Mumbais lifeline.

 Met department officials said the Colaba observatory recorded 104.2mm of rainfall in the past 24 hours in Colaba in the city and 82.6mm in suburban Santa Cruz.

 More than 65mm of rainfall is considered heavy.

 The Met department warned that there could be heavy to very heavy rain (over 125mm) and gusty winds over the next 24 hours.

 Strong cross-winds and heavy showers since Friday morning have brought down visibility, resulting in minor delays in both incoming and outbound flights, said an official at Chattrapati Shivaji airports domestic terminal.

 Most flights to and from Calcutta were more or less on schedule with delays of 5-10 minutes. Only Indians early morning flight was late by 15 minutes. 

 Local trains on the harbour-central lines have been badly hit and were running 25-30 minutes behind schedule, railway sources said. Western Railway services were around five minutes behind schedule. The delays also led to overcrowding, keeping people like Suhasini waiting at the station.

 Heavy downpours since Thursday night have resulted in waterlogging on railway tracks and several low lying areas in Dadar and Parel have been inundated, said a Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation official. 

 Schools and colleges were closed and office-goers headed south had a trying time. 

 We have taken effective preventive measures, including removal of thousands of tyres stored in open places, which facilitate breeding of mosquitoes. Also, a door-to-door survey is being done in all the wards to check for fever cases, said municipal commissioner Jairaj Phatak. 

 Water sampling is being carried out in all the wards to find out any waterborne vectors so that disinfection could be carried out properly, he said.

 With memories of the deluge of July 2005 still fresh, Mumbaikars are afraid to step out into the waterlogged streets. I have been waiting for a taxi for the past 45 minutes. No one wants to venture into the knee-deep water. Now, I have no choice but to walk, said Navin Singh, who lives in Vashi.

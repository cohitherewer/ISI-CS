 Kids win fight to see Kalam

 Chidambaram, Jan. 4: Almost 60 whiz kids, chosen to display their projects at the Indian Science Congress exhibition, staged a protest tonight against a decision to keep them out of an interaction with President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam when he inaugurates this part of the event on Friday.

 They succeeded, but not before a chaotic turn of events.

 The angry students, accompanied by their teacher- guides, stormed the media centre at the venue with their complaint. 

 The students, selected by the National Council for Science and Technology of the central governments department of science and technology, have been allotted 150 stalls at the childrens science exhibition of the congress. 

 The students had been told they would get an opportunity to meet the President. But this morning, after a security drill at the venue for the VIP visit, most of them realised they had been left out. 

 Disappointed at the arbitrary manner of selection 34 local children and some disabled kids were on the list the protesters demanded that all students be given the opportunity.

 The march of the protesters some have come from Kashmir and Nagaland for the exhibition to the media centre forced the secretary of congresss organising committee, Venugopala Menon, to give them attention.

 It is a fight for our rights, cried Pravinder Singh Khalsa, a Class XI student of a school in Jammu and Kashmirs Kathua. In the din, questions were hurled at Menon on the method adopted by the organisers in selecting those who would be allowed to meet the President. 

 The organisers tried to convince them that the number had to be restricted because of space constraints and security considerations but the protesters were in no mood to listen. 

 You are manipulating things, screamed Tribhuvan, a teacher-escort from Rajasthan. He appeared to be alluding to a bias in favour of local children.

 After an hour of verbal volleys, the organisers relented, saying all students will be accommodated in the hall where the President will deliver the inaugural address to the exhibition.

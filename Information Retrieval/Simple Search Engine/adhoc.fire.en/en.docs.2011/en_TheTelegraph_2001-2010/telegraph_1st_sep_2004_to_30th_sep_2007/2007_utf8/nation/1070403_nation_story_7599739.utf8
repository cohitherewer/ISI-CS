 Mahatma posters defaced in Gujarat

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, April 2: A day after the Mahatma Gandhi Sandesh Cycle Yatra was flagged off from the Sabarmati Ashram, 250 cycle yatris were shocked to see posters of the Father of the Nation blackened or torn in Viramgam town.

 As the cycle yatris passed by local BJP MLA Vajubhai Dohiyas office in Viramgam, 50 km from here, they were greeted by black flags. It left no doubt in the mind of Congress workers that those waving the black flags were Dohiyas supporters.

 But in true Gandhian spirit, the cycle yatris offered flowers to those waving the black flags and sang Gandhijis favourite bhajan Raghupati raghav raja ram.

 Congress spokesman Shaktisinh Gohil said the shameful act of tearing and blackening Mahatma Gandhis posters was done by Dohiyas supporters. He demanded that police register a criminal case against the MLA.

 Dohiya denied his supporters were involved. He claimed that those who waved black flags were family members of freedom fighters as they were upset with the involvement of criminal elements in organising the yatra in the town.

 BJP state president Purushottam Rupala said he did not know about the incident. He was noncommittal when asked whether he would take action against Dohiya, if the MLA was found guilty.

 The Congress said chief minister Narendra Modi owed an explanation to the state and the nation for the heinous act by the BJP MLA. 

 What happened in Viramgam was an insult to the Mahatma, and Modi should apologise, the party said.

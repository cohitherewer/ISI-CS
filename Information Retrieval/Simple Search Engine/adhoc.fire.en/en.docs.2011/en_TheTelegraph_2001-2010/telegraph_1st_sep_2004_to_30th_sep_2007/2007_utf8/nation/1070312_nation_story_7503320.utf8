 Missing youth in airport bush

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 11: A youth, depressed after failing several times to clear the IIM entrance exam, was found semi-conscious in the bushes near Calcutta airports domestic terminal.

 Sarada Prasad Mishra, 32, had gone missing from his Bhubaneswar home on March 3. Airport trolley-puller Gaffur spotted a well-dressed man lying semi-conscious in the bushes on Thursday afternoon and informed airport police.

 Saradas mother Pratima said he had been suffering from depression for a while. After completing his BSc, he went to Delhi to do an MBA. But he failed to clear the IIM entrance exam even after trying for several years, she said today over the phone from Bhubaneswar.

 He got a job in a private company but left it.

 Pratima said the family had not smelt a rat when Sarada left home in the afternoon of March 3 but got worried when he did not get back in the night.

 Saradas father Sashi Bhushan Sinha, who retired as a joint secretary with the Orissa governments urban development department, then went out to search for his son.

 He went to the railway station, too, but by then Sarada had got on to a Calcutta-bound train.

 Sarada, who had Rs 2,000 on him and a credit card, spent five days in Calcutta after getting off the train the next morning. The money, his card, shoes and spectacles were all stolen.

 Initially, his family thought he had gone to visit one of his three sisters, married and settled in Mumbai, Jalpaiguri and Angul in Orissa. Sarada is the youngest in the family.

 A missing diary was lodged on March 5 after the family found he had not visited his sisters.

 He was unable to give us any details and spoke only a few sentences in English, a police officer said.

 Late on Thursday, the police found a slip of paper in his pocket having his home phone number and contacted his family. His father took him back the next day.

 Pratima said Sarada had not been eating since Friday. But today he had some food and is better.

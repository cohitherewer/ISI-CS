 Retail war and wink, CPM-style

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, June 26: Keralas merchants have called for a 12-hour closure of shops tomorrow in their first major protest against the entry of retail giants in the state.

 The shutdown, called by a joint action committee of traders and merchants, has the backing of the ruling Left Democratic Front as well as the Opposition Congress.

 The LDF is against the federal policy that allows these giants in the retail sector. The LDF government will oppose its entry as it poses a threat to small retailers, said front convener Vaikom Viswan.

 Agriculture minister Mullakkara Ratnakaran had recently told the Assembly: Reliance (Retail) is a big challenge. Its large enough to control the market and decide prices. We will take it head on.

 Cooperation minister G. Sudhakaran has kicked off an experimental project to take on Reliance and Bharti-WalMart, with a subsidised string of 5,700 retail centres to sell basic provisions.

 Kerala CPM legislator Dinesh Mony, a former mayor of Kochi, however, opened a Reliance Retail store at Thevara in Kochi on June 23. His party colleague and Kochi deputy mayor C.K. Mani Shankar followed suit, launching another Reliance store at Elamakkara.

 The independent Kerala Vyapari-Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti and the pro-Marxist Kerala Vyapari-Vyavasayi Samiti, too, have set aside their feud to take on the retail behemoths.

 In Bengal, however, the CPM has said it cannot oppose the entry of the private sector into retail though Left Front partner Forward Bloc is against the behemoths.

 Kerala, which consumes almost 14 per cent of the nations production, has a large population without a rural-urban divide. It has recently seen a retail boom fuelled by foreign exchange and high salaries.

 The success of Fabmall, Varkeys and Spencers medium-sized convenience stores has spurred the growth of large stores run by individuals and small groups across the state.

 Kerala is expected to have 100 million square feet of quality shopping-centre space by 2007-08, generating retail sales of over $11bn (Rs 41,000 crore). An investment of $4bn (Rs 16,000 crore) on retail infrastructure is in the pipeline.

 Some 15,000 outlets, 100 hypermarkets, 500 department stores and 2,000 supermarkets are expected to come up. Over 10,000 small and big existing outlets are expected to undergo a complete makeover.

 Some states have seen more violent protests. In Ranchi last month, hundreds of street vendors armed with rods attacked three Reliance Fresh outlets before the police chased them away. In Kerala, too, fireworks can be expected when Wal-Mart lands.

 Reliance Retail has started work on farm produce collection centres in Kochi, Kottayam, Idukki, Palakkad and Malappuram.

 We are only into procurement now, cutting out middlemen to offer better prices. We give expert technical inputs and real-time market intelligence to guide local farmers on what, how and when to produce according to market trends and needs, S.S. Salumon, Reliances procurement head for Kerala, said recently.

 The Kerala Horticulture Development Corporation plans procurement centres of its own across the state, eliminating middlemen. World-class supermarkets are being planned in Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode.

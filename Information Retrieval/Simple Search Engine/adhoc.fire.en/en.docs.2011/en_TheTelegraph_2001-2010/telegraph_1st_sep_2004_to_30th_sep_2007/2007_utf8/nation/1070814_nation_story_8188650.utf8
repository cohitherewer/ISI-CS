 Free second honeymoon 

 Pune, Aug. 13 (PTI): Attention newly weds! Heres a chance to go on a second honeymoon, that too for free.

 All you have to do is give your word that you will wait two years before having your first child. In return, you will get Rs 5,000 in cash, which you can use to relive those oh-so-sugary days.

 The Satara district administration has hit upon this innovative idea to reduce the climbing birth rate in this west Maharashtra district. The scheme kicks off on Wednesday and is open to couples married after April 2007.

 District health officials have begun a drive to coax couples, especially from rural areas, to go in for the scheme. The second honeymoon scheme will be funded by the National Rural Health Mission.

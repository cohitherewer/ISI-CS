 Antarctica tourism curb call

 New Delhi, April 21: India will seek approval for its new research base in Antarctica and urge greater regulation of tourism to the ice continent at the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting next month.

 Indias scientific community plans to set up a new base at Larsemann Hills in eastern Antarctica, a region that was connected to India millions of years ago when the two landmasses were part of Gondwanaland, a supercontinent.

 The proposal has been under debate amid concerns from some quarters over the environmental impact of a new permanent station in the region, ministry of earth sciences officials said. Weve got a draft document to eliminate such concerns, said Rasik Ravindra, director of the National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research in Goa.

 The new site at Larsemann Hills is about 2,000 km east of Maitri, Indias existing station along the sea route and is close to the Australian, Chinese and Russian stations.

 This is an interesting region for us because it was connected to the Mahanadi region in eastern India before the continents separated, said Sharadindu Mukerji, director of the Antarctic division of the Geological Survey of India. The geological features of the Mahanadi area and the Lambert glacier in eastern Antarctica make a perfect fit.

 Science, technology and earth sciences minister Kapil Sibal said Indias presence was only for research and India was opposed to the continents exploitation. Well try and persuade countries not to use Antarctica for exploitation, and tourism is also a form of exploitation.

 International tour operators estimate that 25,000 tourists visited Antarctica in 2005-06, by ships or aircraft. 

 Its unrealistic to expect that tourism can be completely stopped, said Swayam Prabha Das, coordinator of World Wide Fund for Natures oceans programme. But tourist traffic could be regulated.

 CM signal to party

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 5: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee appears to have signalled to the CPM leadership that he is going to put in place his own peace initiative on Nandigram instead of allowing the party to usurp the governments space and use force to regain bases there.

 Coming ahead of Sundays crucial CPM state committee meeting, Bhattacharjees show of resolve is reflected in the status report state home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray submitted on Thursday to Calcutta High Court.

 The report refers to the role of CPM supporters in clashes with the Opposition and organising assaults on social activists between April 29 and May 1 in Nandigram.

 How a bureaucrat could submit an anti-CPM document to the court on an issue like Nandigram without obtaining first a go-ahead from the chief minister (also police minister) is something the leadership will try to gauge at tomorrows meeting, a party official said.

 Senior party leader Benoy Konar was guarded while commenting on the issue: Nearly 4,000 CPM supporters have been displaced in Nandigram. If he (Ray) does not mention the regular assaults on us and holds our party responsible for the violence in Nandigram, it is unfortunate. He then ceases to be state home secretary and instead qualifies to be called Trinamul Congresss secretary. But, mark my emphasis on if.

 The significance of the report lies in the fact that for the first time since violence erupted in Nandigram, the state government has admitted that party cadres had a role in the clashes.

 Ray appeared unfazed. Surely I could not have produced or filed it without the chief ministers knowledge.

 Rays report is now being interpreted as a political statement by Bhattacharjee, who has been trying to offer a healing touch to the people of Nandigram, get the Opposition to the negotiating table and repair his image by making the government come through as a neutral entity.

 They (the CPM) may feel awkward for some time, thanks to this report, said Kshiti Goswami, a minister and RSP leader. But in the long run, the report will help us project the government as a fair-minded, neutral body, not guided by the narrow compulsions of the parties that run it.

 CPM officials said most senior leaders, including Jyoti Basu, were not concerned with the structuring or filing of the status report in the court. Party sources, though, said the chief minister had kept state party secretary Biman Bose broadly informed, but it could not be confirmed.

 Publicly, Bhattacharjee said: Only three of 25 points mentioned in the status report are being amplified.

 Armed police posted

 The Eastern Frontier Rifles, a wing of the state armed police, has been deployed at Bahargunj on the border of Opposition-stronghold Nandigram and CPM-hub Khejuri. CPM workers driven out of Nandigram petitioned the high court for an order to the government to arrange for their safe return.

 Angry ladies, Burdwan to Belgaum

 Railway minister Lalu Prasad with Rasulan Bibi, widow of 1965 Indo-Pak war hero Abdul Hameed, and her grandson Jamil Alam at his office in Delhi. Jamil was handed an appointment letter on Friday. 

Earlier in the day, denial of appointment drove a woman from Bengal to throw a stone at the ministers car. Rita, 40, who runs an institute in Burdwan, had been trying to meet him for three days. She wanted his help in getting a job in the capital.

 Bangalore, Aug. 31: Women power was on parade in the streets of Belgaum today with 3,000 marching to demand the arrest of a gangster for raping and killing a 35-year-old lady, reports our special correspondent.

 Activists, college students and homemakers forced shops to down shutters even brandishing chappals and shoes to force those who resisted as they gunned for Pravin Shintre who is allegedly involved in three other murders.

 Shintre, believed to be a contract killer, was allegedly paid by Sheetals husband Ravindra Chougale to murder her as he was apparently having an affair with a college sweetheart.

 The body of Sheetal, who was from a prominent business family, was found dumped in a forest close to Belgaum, 500km from Bangalore, earlier this month. She had three daughters.

 Yesterday, women activists had called on Belgaum police superintendent Hemnath Nimbalkar and urged him to arrest Shintre. But when he was non-committal, they threatened to stage a march and enforce a bandh today. They also alleged that the police were not taking action because Shintre had political clout. 

 The local chamber of commerce and other organisations backed them.

 The march ended at Rajdeep Bungalow, where Sheetals husband dropped her before she was allegedly murdered on August 11. Shintre is believed to be behind the killing of another woman, Raziya Badebhai, last month.

 We are making all efforts to nab Shintre and his gang members, R. Auradkar, the northern range IG, said.

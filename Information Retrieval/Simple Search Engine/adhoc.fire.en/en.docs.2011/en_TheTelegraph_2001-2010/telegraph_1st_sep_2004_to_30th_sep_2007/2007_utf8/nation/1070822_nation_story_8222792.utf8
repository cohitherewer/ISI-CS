 Washington, Aug. 21: Ronen Sen, temperamentally cautious and reflective, joins a list of high-calibre Indian diplomats who have paid a price for promoting policies they not only helped execute, but also fervently believe in.

 The embassy here, with a staff of slightly over 130 people that he presides over, was a picture of outward calm today. But beneath that apparent calm was a cauldron of anxiety, concern and a heavy hangover from a night of burning the midnight oil.

 Key members of Sens team were up most of the night drafting and transmitting messages back and forth to external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, who read out the ambassadors explanation in an effort to calm members of Parliament.

 Fortuitously, the embassys telephone lines went on the blink yesterday. That saved the diplomats inside from being swamped by calls, mainly from Indian Americans, this morning.

 A large number of Indian Americans, who have worked very hard for the passage of the nuclear deal in the last two years, have been worried that the political crisis in New Delhi may see the end of the deal. They are now concerned that a key architect who helped design the deal may pay a price for speaking his mind about the recent developments back home.

 Most prominent among Indian diplomats who have been in the same boat in which Sen found himself today was the late J.N. Dixit, former foreign secretary, who was the Manmohan Singh governments national security adviser until his death in 2005.

 Like Sen last weekend, Dixit gave an interview to a journalist, Dhiren Bhagat, in 1988. Dixit was then Indias high commissioner in Colombo and Bhagat, who subsequently died in a car accident, published the interview in The Observer of London. 

 It was far more explosive than anything that Sen told Aziz Haniffa, a Sri Lankan journalist with three decades of experience covering Indian affairs in the US. 

 Bhagats report from Colombo quoted Dixit revealing intricate details of Indias monthly payments to Tamil Tigers. Sri Lanka was then the most serious foreign policy issue for the Rajiv Gandhi government, which was already reeling under domestic pressure on Bofors.

 Like Sens assertion today disputed by Haniffa that his conversation was off the record, Dixits statements to Bhagat were not meant for publication, according to one version of the controversy.

 What is true is that Dixits revelations set off a political storm in New Delhi. Like the furore in both Houses of Parliament today. 

 In 1998, Dixits predecessor as national security adviser, Brajesh Mishra, was in the eye of a storm over a letter he had drafted, stating that China was the reason for Indias decision to exercise the nuclear option. The letter from then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to then US President Bill Clinton was leaked to The New York Times. 

 Foreign secretary S.K. Singh lost his job in 1990 after ill-considered remarks to the media about the Indo-Pakistan peace process at Islamabad airport during a visit.

 Similarly Eric Goslaves, who was considered a shoo-in for the foreign secretarys job was sidelined by Indira Gandhi after he was indiscreet in talking to the media in Bangkok about Indias nuclear options.

 Indian diplomacy has also seen a reverse of this syndrome. Rajiv Gandhi sacked foreign secretary A.P. Venkateswaran on television after the official was suspected of undermining Rajivs Pakistan policy, among other things, by planting stories in the media.

 Guide for life support

 New Delhi, Sept. 13 (PTI): The Law Commission has recommended forming a panel of medical experts to clear decisions like whether a doctor may withdraw life support to a terminally ill patient.

 Sources said the move is aimed at saving doctors from the harassment that often follows such decisions. 

 A 434-page report by the panel proposed that a panel of three members with over 20 years experience in the medical profession be set up. The panel, it added, should be formed by a statutory body and the names of the members published in the gazette and official websites for quick access.

 The majority decision of the panel will prevail and would be binding on doctors, the commission said.

 The report also provides for safeguards for doctors against litigation and encourages patients and their relatives to approach high courts for a declaration on whether the decision to continue or withdraw life support is lawful.

 Once the high court has cleared a doctors decision, it will be binding on civil or criminal courts not to proceed against him in any matter relating to the case, the commission said.

 The commission maintained that withdrawal of life support to terminally ill patients has always been lawful in all countries, and sought to make it clear that this was different from euthanasia or assisted suicide, which have always been held unlawful and continue to be unlawful.

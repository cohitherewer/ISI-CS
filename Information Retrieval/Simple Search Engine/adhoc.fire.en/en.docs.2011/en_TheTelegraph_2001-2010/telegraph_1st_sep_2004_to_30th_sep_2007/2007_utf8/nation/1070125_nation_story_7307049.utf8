 Court moved for labour-friendly IT laws

 Madurai, Jan. 24 (PTI): Madras High Court today admitted a petition seeking a directive to the Union labour and information technology ministries to frame labour-friendly laws that would govern working conditions in the IT sector.

 Justice A. Kulasekaran asked the standing counsel for the central government to take note of the writ petition. 

 Petitioners I. Johnson Devaraj and J. Jebaselvi, both computer science graduates, submitted they joined a private software development company in Tuticorin on July 29, 2000. The company took the couples degree certificates and asked them to sign a three-year contract extendable by a year.

 Devaraj said his wife could not attend office for 178 days during her first pregnancy in 2002, and for 172 days during her second pregnancy. 

 When she resigned on August 2, 2004, the company did not return her certificates. It issued a notice in September 2004, demanding Rs 6 lakh as damages for missing office for 350 days. The company invoked the arbitration clause in the agreement and obtained an award of Rs 6,41,459 with 18 per cent interest. It also threatened to attach Devarajs salary. 

 The petition has sought to quash the arbitration award as unconstitutional.

 Quality check for medical devices

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: The government will introduce legislation to regulate the quality of medical devices used in diagnosis and treatment, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal has said. 

 The department of science and technology is preparing the legislation to enforce uniform standards of medical devices across the country and create a regulatory authority to set up a system of quality, safety and efficacy certification for medical devices. 

 The intention is to establish a national system of certification so that effective medical devices are available across the country, Sibal said today, announcing the initiative. 

 Doctors and sections of the industry have expressed their concerns that medical devices that have neither been adequately tested nor formally approved by drug regulators have been used on Indian patients. 

 Overall, for all types of medical devices, I dont think we have a good regulatory system in place today, said Dr T.S. Kler, a senior cardiologist at the Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre in Delhi. 

 Relying on data from the medical devices industry, Kler had warned two years ago that hundreds of heart patients in India may have received tiny metallic implants called drug-coated stents that had not been approved by drug regulators. 

 This legislation is coming at the right time, said Dr Parduman Singh, the president of the Indian Association of Clinical Biochemists. 

 The diversity of medical devices available in the market has increased sharply in recent years. The number of hospitals that offer implant-based services is also rising. In such a situation, we need legislation for quality assurance, Singh said. 

 Medical devices range from simple, temporary implants used in the repair of broken bones to complex devices with electronic components intended to be permanently in place in the human body. 

 However, some drug industry experts argue that the absence of effective quality certification of devices is because Indias drug regulators had traditionally declined to take responsibility for devices. 

 The legal definition of a drug in India is very wide. Its not just chemicals. Anything used in treating a medical disorder is a drug, said Dr Chandra Gulhati, editor of Monthly Index of Medical Specialities, India. 

 Experts have said failure of medical devices could stem from several reasons mechanical faults, electrical component failure, degradation, or even user errors. Sophisticated implants should be handled by professionals who have experience with such devices.

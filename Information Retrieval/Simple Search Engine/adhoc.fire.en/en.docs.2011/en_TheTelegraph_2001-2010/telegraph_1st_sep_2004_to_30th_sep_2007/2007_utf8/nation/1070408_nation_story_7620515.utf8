 IIM brake fuels brain drain fear

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 

 New Delhi, April 7: Forced by the government to delay declaration of entrance results, the top Indian Institutes of Management are fearing the loss of the best and the brightest to other business schools. 

 Unsure of whether they will make the IIM grade, the best students may register and pay the fees for second-rung B-schools that come out with their list of final successful candidates before them, IIM administrations fear. 

 The Union human resource development ministry yesterday issued a circular to the IIMs, IITs and other centrally funded higher education institutes asking them to freeze the declaration of final results, pending a fresh directive. 

 The IIMs had planned to declare the results on April 12.

 The central directive came ahead of an impending initiative to get a Supreme Court stay vacated and introduce the OBC quota from this year itself. The government is expected to move the Supreme Court at the earliest.

 But the IIMs are keeping their fingers crossed. The academic session will probably still start on time but there is concern that we may lose some of our best students to other B-schools, Professor Ashish Bhattacharya, admissions in-charge at IIM Calcutta, said.

 Added an agitated administrator from IIM Bangalore: All the B-schools ask for the fees to be paid (usually a few lakhs) within a specified date. In most cases, the fees are non-refundable. A student who gets through somewhere else but is unsure of whether he has made it to the IIMs would probably choose the other B-school.

 This is the first time the IIMs have been unable to declare their final results on time in their over four-decade-long history. 

 IIMs in Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta are routinely rated the three most sought-after B-schools by students. Close on their heels, though, are private B-schools like the Xaviers Labour Research Institute in Jamshedpur and the SP Jain schools in Mumbai and Delhi. 

 Other popular private B-schools, like the Narsee Monjee school in Mumbai, Institute of Management and Technology in Ghaziabad, and the Indian Management Institute in Gurgaon admit students on the basis of their scores in CAT, also the entrance exam for the IIMs. The Centres freeze doesnt apply to these institutes, most of which are expected to finalise results in a fortnight. 

 OBC students taking the Indian Institute of Technologys entrance the Joint Entrance Examination tomorrow will be asked to tick-mark a box on the answer booklet.

 IIMC chairman

 Ajit Balakrishnan, who heads Rediff, has been appointed the chairman of the board of IIM Calcutta. Balakrishnan, an IIMC alumnus, will take over from Y.C. Deveshwar.

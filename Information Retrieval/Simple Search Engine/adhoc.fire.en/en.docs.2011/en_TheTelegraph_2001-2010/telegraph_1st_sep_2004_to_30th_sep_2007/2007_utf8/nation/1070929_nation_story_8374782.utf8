 SC bars Muslim quota

 - Extend backward cover to community, says court

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 Reddy: Quota row 

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: The Supreme Court today objected to the Muslims only quota introduced by a recent Andhra Pradesh law for backward sections of that community.

 It said the state, which has a 46 per cent quota for backwards, could easily increase reservations by 4 per cent there is a court-mandated 50 per cent cap on quotas and include backward sections of Muslims in that.

 But the state cannot have a separate category of quotas only for Muslims, the court said. Is that permissible (under the Constitution)? a bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan asked. 

 The court also stayed further admissions under the new quota till Monday when the case comes up for hearing again. But it said the admissions made till date would be protected.

 The state has created a separate E category, comprising only backward Muslims, for job and education quotas. Under the new classification, 14 sub-castes of Muslims would be eligible for benefits. The state has a Muslim population of 11 per cent.

 The Centre stoutly defended the exercise for identifying backwards among Muslims for reservation. If we can conduct such an exercise for Hindus, why not for Muslims? solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati asked.

 If they are the poorest of the poor and they have been left out, why is it impermissible?

 He gave the example of the Gosangi Muslims in the state who live in and around burial grounds. They are the poorest of the poor and most of them beg for a living. 

 The state, through senior counsel Indira Jaisingh, also defended the law.

 But Harish Salve, the counsel for petitioners T. Muralidhar Rao and Sriteja Kumarusu, argued that the law was a thinly-disguised attempt at communal reservation. This is a reservation for a community. 

 He also claimed that the exercise of identifying the backwards among Muslims was flawed. No one had been left out except Pathans and Mughals who do not exist in the state, he argued.

 The court then sought an explanation from the state on a residual entry it had made in the Muslim backwards list.

 The petitioners had first challenged the law before the high court. 

 When it refused to intervene, they moved the Supreme Court.

 Ahmedabad, Feb. 2: In a state where saffron mobs succeeded in clamping an unofficial ban on Aamir Khans Fanaa, a film dealing with the pain of the 2002 riots now faces an unofficial censor.

 Parzania, based on the real-life tragedy of a Parsi couple whose teenage son went missing in the violence, must convince theatre owners at a special preview that it contains nothing objectionable.

 The film was released across the country on Republic Day except in Gujarat, where theatres and multiplexes gave it a miss amid threats from the Bajrang Dal, accused of playing a lead role in the riots.

 When my booking agent in Mumbai first suggested a special screening for the cinema owners, I refused as a matter of principle, director Rahul Dholakia said. After all, the censor board had already cleared the film and it was being screened across the country.

 But he swallowed his objections because he desperately wants Parzania to be shown in the state whose trauma it depicts.

 If a special screening is the only solution, Im prepared to compromise my principles for the sake of Dara Modi and his family who are still searching for their son and hope to find him in Gujarat, Dholakia said.

 Dara, the father of Azhar who went missing as a 14-year-old, hopes that after the film has made enough people aware of his tragedy, someone might come up with a vital lead on his son.

 The official explanation from the cinema owners, who will not admit to receiving threats, is that the film had to be held back because the big-budget Salaam-e-Ishq was released on January 26.

 But Dholakia confirmed that his booking agent had received threat calls.

 I know there are forces like the Bajrang Dal who have a problem with the film and do not want it released in Gujarat but I am hopeful. Members of the Gujarat Multiplex Owners Association are willing to show the film from February 9 if the special preview satisfies them.

 Dholakia doesnt want any politicians invited to the special screening. He hopes the theatre owners would react to the film the way any ordinary movie-goer one who has no political agenda can be expected to.

 The director believes that the film should be shown in Gujarat for the sake of the thousands of Gujaratis who have signed an online petition seeking its release, as well as those who like good, sensitive films. The petition has been emailed to chief minister Narendra Modi.

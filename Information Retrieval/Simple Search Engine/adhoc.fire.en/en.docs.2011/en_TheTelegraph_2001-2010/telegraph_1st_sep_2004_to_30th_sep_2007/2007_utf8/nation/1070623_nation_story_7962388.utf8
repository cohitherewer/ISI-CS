 SC eye on road rage

New Delhi, June 22 (PTI): The Supreme Court has voiced concern over the number of road accidents in the country and favoured amending the law to enhance punishment for reckless driving.

 But as the maximum sentence is two years under IPC Section 304a, no higher punishment can be imposed on an offender, the court said. It reduced to two years a five-year rigorous imprisonment term awarded to a bus driver.

 The driver, Prabhakaran, was charged with reckless driving resulting in the death of a schoolboy.

 The apex court said out of 1.2 million people killed in road accidents across the world, India accounts for 59,927 deaths. 

 In addition to the devastating human toll, the economic impact of road crashes is also enormous. Many of those injured or killed are wage earners, leaving their families destitute and without means of support, it said.

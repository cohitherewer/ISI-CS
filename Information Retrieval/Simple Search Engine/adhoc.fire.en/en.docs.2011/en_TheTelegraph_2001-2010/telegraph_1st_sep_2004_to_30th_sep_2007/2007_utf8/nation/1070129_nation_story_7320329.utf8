 Bollywood films on Net, in UK

 TONY GLOVER

 London, Jan. 28: Communications group BT plans to launch an Internet TV service aimed at Britains Indian community that will allow viewers to watch Bollywood films without having to wait for their release in this country. 

 BT Vision, the groups new Internet TV arm, is keeping its Indian film catalogue under wraps until the launch, but it is expected viewers will be able to pay to download lesser-known titles rather than Indias recent international blockbusters such as Devdas. 

 BT believes niche entertainment will differentiate BT Vision from traditional TV channels and existing video-on-demand services. 

 The Indian community in Britain is poorly served for entertainment, said a BT spokesman. UK cinemas rarely show Bollywood films, whereas in India they are available 24/7. The economics of providing this kind of specialist content work better on Internet TVs narrow-cast technology, where films can be stored on central computers, than on televisions traditional broadcasting platform. 

 The Bollywood initiative is being led by Hanif Lalani, BTs group finance director, himself a Bollywood fan. But BT says that similar on-demand services are also being planned for other niche audiences and that a service aimed specifically at Londons Polish community is also now being prepared for launch.

 Pension protest to PM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 20: Left parties have written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh asking him to put on hold the Centres decision to allow private and foreign firms to manage pension funds.

 The letter expressed surprise at the finance ministrys move to allow the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) to invite bids for sponsoring the corpus under the new scheme.

 As you are aware, the Left parties have been opposed to (the) PFRDA bill. We have had a number of rounds of discussions on the matter in the UPA-Left coordination meeting, it said.

 The letter signed by Prakash Karat, A.B. Bardhan and Debabrata Biswas, the general secretaries of the CPM, CPI and the Forward Bloc, respectively, and RSP secretary Abani Roy said the bill has not been taken up for adoption as pending issues were yet to be settled under the new pension scheme.

 It is, therefore, surprising that the PFRDA has proceeded to operationalise the pension scheme. We wish to register our strong disapproval of this move, the Left leaders said. The letter suggested that the funds be placed with the employees provident fund organisation till a final decision is taken on the new pension scheme.

 The Left protest has come in the wake of the pension authoritys move to appoint the National Securities Depository Limited as the central record-keeping agency and invite bids to appoint fund managers.

 The Left parties say the fund should be managed only by public sector bodies. 

 The government has accepted the demand but also allowed FDI in entities floated by public sector institutions for fund management.

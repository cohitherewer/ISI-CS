The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Channel in dock

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: The Election Commission today decided to file an FIR against NDTV for violating electoral law by telecasting Insta Poll on elections in Punjab while polling was on.

 The decision was taken after the news channel failed to reply by 4.30 pm to a showcause notice served on it.

 Under Insta Poll, the channel was giving exit poll-like projections even while the polling was in progress as to who was in the lead between the two main contenders, Congress and Akali Dal (Badal). 

 In its showcause notice, the commission alleged that the news channel, by telecasting Insta Poll, had violated the provisions of Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The channel, which was asked to reply by 4.30 pm today, had not done so by 6 pm.

 We have not yet received any reply from the NDTV, deputy election commissioner R. Bhattacharya told reporters. 

 Exit polls see Akali victory

 Two television channels predicted victory for the Opposition Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP combine in the Punjab Assembly polls, which recorded a 65 per cent voter turnout despite rains. 

 The STAR News exit poll predicted 60 seats for the Akali-BJP combine, 48 for the Congress and allies, and seven for others. NDTV put the figures at 55-65 for Akalis, 45-55 for the Congress and 5-10 for others. CNN-IBN forecast 47-57 seats for the Akalis, 53-63 for the Congress and 3-9 for others.

 The majority mark in the 117-member House is 59. Counting will be held on February 27.

 Bullet riddle

 Thiruvananthapuram, Feb. 17: A top security officer at the airport here has said the five bullets, for which Pinarayi Vijayan was detained at a Chennai airport yesterday, were not in his hand baggage or on his person when he left Kerala.

 Vijayan was accompanied by his wife Kamala on the flight to Chennai. But it could not be confirmed whether the Kerala CPM secretary had taken her out of the airport at Chennai for medical consultation or whether he had stayed back until the departure of the evening flight to Delhi.

 The case has become curious since Friday evening when a baggage scan revealed the cartridges used in a .38 revolver and Central Industrial Security Force personnel at Chennai airport questioned Vijayan.

 CBI nails MP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 28: A Samajwadi Party MP accused of scaring off bidders so his friend could buy a steel company cheap has been slapped with a charge-sheet by the CBI.

 Ateek Ahmed, elected from Phulpur in Uttar Pradesh, faces charges of criminal conspiracy, intimidation and use of force to keep a public servant from doing his duty.

 Over a year ago, Ahmed had allegedly led a band of gunmen into the office of the liquidator in Allahabad, who was overseeing the auction of a Kanpur-based steel companys assets, and terrorised the officials and bidders. 

 The CBI, which took over the case from police, names Delhi businessman Bishan Chandra Gupta and Ahmeds aide Bhuvan Chandra Pant as co-accused.

 The charge-sheet, filed last month, says the company Rajinder Steel was wound up in May 1999 and its two units in Raipur and Kanpur were to be auctioned under a court order. The reserve price for the Kanpur unit was fixed at Rs 8.5 crore and that for the Raipur unit at Rs 22 crore.

 Gupta, who was a bidder, allegedly sought Ahmeds help to influence the process.

 The charge-sheet says a large number of bidders were interested but were stopped by the MP and his armed supporters. Gupta is believed to have bought the Raipur unit for only Rs 27.51 crore.

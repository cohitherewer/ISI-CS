 Leg torn, life lost

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 27: A 70-year-old man died on the surgery table after a train sliced his right leg and flung it away in full public view on Strand Road.

 Rajinder Singh Yadav had gone near the Circular Railway tracks to relieve himself. A constable saw a train approaching and let out a scream, asking Rajinder to move, but it was too late.

 A constable stood guarding the leg until it was taken to NRS hospital where Rajinder was admitted. As the surgery was nearing completion, Rajinder died.

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Toilet brigade raises a stink

 Dont give them toilets, they will grab your office. Thats just what a group of women angry at poor sanitation facilities on the outskirts of Mumbai did this week.

 About 30 women from Tisavali village, near Kalyan, gathered at the panchayat office to complain about the poor state of public toilets in the area. 

 Women who do not have toilets in their homes have to relieve themselves in the open. Worse, some public toilets, lying half built for months, have no doors or lights, said Manda Mhatre, one of those who led the group.

 Matters got worse when sarpanch Gopal Mali declared the toilets would be built only if the authorities had money after renovating the panchayat office. 

 The reply left the women fuming. In no time, Mali and his colleagues were pushed out, the office was locked up and the keys taken away. The office was opened later, but not before police booked some protesters for the trouble.

 Life in a CCTV world

 Life in Hyderabad suddenly has an edgy feel to it. Last weeks blasts changed the city as most people knew it.

 No pillion riding, no street- corner meetings and no raucous events. Only metal detectors, wailing sirens and policemen. This isnt a war zone, but it sometimes seems like one.

 After mosques, temples and other places of worship, the prying closed-circuit TVs will invade cinema theatres and malls. The authorities know the steps are not earning them popularity points, but say they are helpless.

 We have a security and threat perception in not just the old city but all of Hyderabad. We cant ignore it, said Hyderabad police commissioner Balwinder Singh. 

 Theatres have been advised to install closed-circuit TVs and door-frame metal detectors. Last year, a grenade blast in the Odeon theatre had wounded two persons. 

 A camera at the IMAX multiplex helped catch a Telangana activist and his associates planting a bomb in the theatre.

 Good times for Dharavi

 Dharavi, central Mumbais biggest squalor zone and Asias largest slum, is poised for a long-delayed makeover.

 Earlier this week, the Maharashtra government decided to float global tenders in June for the redevelopment of 144 acres in the area where Dharavi is located.

 The project is estimated to cost Rs 5,600 crore. The money will come from developers selected after the tender process, the government said after a meeting on the plan attended by chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh. 

 Shanty-dwellers will be shifted to seven-storeyed buildings that are supposed to come up as part of the plan.

 The new-look Dharavi will boast of gardens, schools and hospitals, also to be built by the developers. Deshmukh, however, said the revamp plans would be given shape only after taking the views of slum-dwellers into account. 

 Take-off signal

 Bangalore International Airport, set to open less than a year from now, received a logistics boost this week with the signing of a 10-year deal for fuelling of planes.

 The agreement will allow Indianoil Skytanking to fuel aircraft directly from its dispensers by connecting it to the hydrant system. The company, a joint venture between public sector giant Indian Oil and Germanys Skytanking Holding, will finish building a $23-million fuel storage facility and hydrant system by the end of this year.

 The new airport, touted as an answer to the problems that have bogged the existing one, is expected to handle up to 1,00,000 take-offs and landings every year.

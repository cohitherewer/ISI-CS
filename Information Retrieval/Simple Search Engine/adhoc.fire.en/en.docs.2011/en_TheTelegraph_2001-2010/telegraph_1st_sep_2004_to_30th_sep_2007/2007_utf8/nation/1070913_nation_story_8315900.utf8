 Uma threat to sue PM and Sonia

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhopal, Sept. 13: Uma Bharti has seized on the bridge to return from her own vanvas and threatened to file a case against Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh in New Delhi on September 22.

 Uma, who heads the breakaway and near-defunct Bhartiya Jan Shakti Party, said her complaint against the two would be based on the Centres affidavit on the Sethusamudram project.

 I will file a case against Manmohan Singh, UPA chairperson Sonia and all those responsible for hurting religious sentiments, Uma said in Bhopal today.

 In a veiled reference to Sonia, Uma (in picture) said the affidavit was filed because persons at the top were ignorant and alien to Indian culture, customs and traditions.

 Uma sought to stress that the bridge is her own cause. In Madhya Pradesh, Uma hopes to counter the BJP with her belligerent stand on the sea-lane project. The BJP is set to hold its national executive meeting in Madhya Pradesh from September 21 to 23.

 The BJP regime in the state is also leaving no stone unturned and has decided to look for Rampath (the route that Ram had taken during his exile to Sri Lanka).

 State ministers Laxmikant Sharma and Nagendra Singh have written to the local ASI office to give them a list of places falling under present-day Madhya Pradesh where Ram may have travelled.

 The idea is to promote the Rampath circuit as part of religious tourism, culture minister Sharma said.

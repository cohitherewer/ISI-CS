 Nursery-KG merger

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 7: Delhi High Court today asked an expert committee to try and evolve a mechanism allowing the two years of pre-primary school commonly referred to as nursery and KG to be compressed into one year. 

 The court-appointed committee, headed by Central Board of Secondary Education chairman Ashok Ganguly, was asked by the bench of Chief Justice M.K. Sharma and Justice Sanjeev Khanna to submit a report by March 31. 

 The courts suggestion appears to have sent the capitals schools into a tizzy, with many of the top ones holding sudden meetings to discuss implications of such a scenario. 

 We need to study the full court order. But if it happens, it will be a problem, said Delhi Public School Ramakrishna Puram principal Shyama Chona. 

 The suggestion came up as a possible solution to an ongoing battle between the court and the Delhi government over nursery admissions. Under Section 3 of the Delhi Schools Education Act, a child must be four years old by September 30 to apply for admission that year in other words, the child would have to be about three-and-a-half years old when the yearly admission process gets into gear in March-April. 

 The court, however, in a judgment on January 17 declared that children who had turned three by March 31 would be eligible for admission to nursery that year. 

 The Delhi government has been opposing the court judgment claiming children would be too young to go to school at three. 

 The high court today reiterated its January 17 judgment, rejecting a Delhi government appeal against it. But if the government wanted to stick to its cut-off age, it could compress the pre-primary years into one year, the court suggested. The ruling came on a PIL filed by parents who want their children to finish school before they turn 18. At present, students turn 18 while they are still in Class XII.

 Delhi education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely was in no mood to give up though. If need be, we will bring a legislation in the Assembly challenging the new age criteria, he said.

 Chauhan tries to put house in order

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Chauhan and Gaur: No love lost 

 Bhopal, Sept. 5: The BJP national executive is set to meet here from September 21 to 23, but all is not well with the state party unit.

 In an apparent attempt to set things right, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan called on his predecessor Babulal Gaur today.

 Gaur, now reduced to state minister for commercial tax, has been sulking since he was divested of the more lucrative trade and industry portfolio a week ago. He was particularly upset as the change came a few weeks before the global investors meet, scheduled for October 24-26 in Indore.

 The former chief minister, however, sounded cheerful after the meeting. He said some misunderstandings were cleared.

 Chauhan reportedly assured Gaur that he would get more departments, including the one looking after Bhopal gas tragedy victims. The former chief minister said he could not understand the logic behind not giving him the department. I am a gas victim, too.

 The meeting came in the wake of reports that over a dozen disgruntled BJP MLAs had met Gaur with a proposal to form a separate group within the BJP legislature party. 

 But he said he had refused to become the dissidents leader as he was a disciplined soldier of the party.

 Todays meeting is likely to dissuade state party spokesperson Uma Shankar Gupta, a close associate of Gaur, from sitting on dharna against the deteriorating law and order in the state capital. 

 Recently, Gaur had alleged that Chauhan was jealous of his popularity and mass appeal. A former trade union leader, he hails from Bhopal and holds jan darshan (mass interaction) programmes regularly.

 Gaurs move to summon senior officials, including the chief secretary and others who are not under his departments, had raised eyebrows in Bhopals bureaucratic circles.

 In state politics, the septuagenarian is senior to Chauhan. While acknowledging that it was the chief ministers discretion to select his team, Gaur had said: These powers should be exercised with utmost care to avoid bitterness.

 The chief minister should have shown respect to his colleagues, particularly the seniors, and held consultations before effecting portfolio changes.

 A senior official close to Gaur said he wanted to keep the trade and industry portfolio as he had worked very hard for the investors meet, travelling within and outside India to court captains of industry. One fine day, it is all over.

 His timely action prevented the shifting of Bina Refinery from the state to Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, Gaur claimed. Besides, he said, his efforts had helped in securing investment offers of nearly Rs 180,000 crore from domestic and overseas markets. 

 The minister was also a staunch supporter of Reliances entry into the farm retail sector. 

 The companys outlets in Jabalpur faced protests from the fruit and vegetable sellers union today. The protesters took out a rally and vandalised an office of Reliance Mobile, taking it to be an associate of Reliance Fresh. The protesters alleged that Reliance Fresh stores would ruin their business.

 But Gaur claimed it would provide more job opportunities to youths and a better deal to farmers.

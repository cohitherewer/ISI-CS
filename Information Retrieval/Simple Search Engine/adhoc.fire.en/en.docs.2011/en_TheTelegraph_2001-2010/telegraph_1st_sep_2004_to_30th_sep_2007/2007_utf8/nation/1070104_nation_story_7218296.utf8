 Wife takes actor to court

 Chennai, Jan. 3 (PTI): Tamil actor Prasanths wife, who has not been staying with her husband for the last one year, yesterday filed a petition in a family court seeking an interim monthly maintenance of Rs 1 lakh for herself, her infant son and towards litigation expenses. 

 P.D. Grihalakshmi cont- ended that her in-laws had told her to go to her parents house on January 2, 2006 when it was found that she had conceived. 

 Although doctors had advised her complete bed-rest as she had developed a dermoid cyst, she alleged her husbands family did not cooperate with her, nor helped her cope with pregnancy. 

 The petition said Grihalakshmis in-laws were never satisfied with the dowry given to them and kept on making demands for more. 

 She said neither anybody from her in-laws had come to see her at her parents place nor had they informed her about their whereabouts after shifting their residence. No one turned up even after the baby was born. 

 Grihalakshmi claimed she had to spend about Rs 1 lakh a month during the period of pregnancy, which was paid by her father. He had also paid Rs 2 lakh as the cost of removing and testing the cyst, she said.

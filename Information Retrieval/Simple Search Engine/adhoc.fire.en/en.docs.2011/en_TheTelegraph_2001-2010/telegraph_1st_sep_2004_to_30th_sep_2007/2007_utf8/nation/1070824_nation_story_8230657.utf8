 No work, no pay? No-no

 New Delhi, Aug. 23 (PTI): Indias MPs will not put their money where their mouth is. Lok Sabha members tonight blocked a proposal to fine MPs who disrupt proceedings.

 There was a commonality that no-work, no-pay should not apply, Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said after an all-party meeting.He added that the MPs also rejected a proposal to suspend members for five sittings or the remainder of the session, whichever was less, if they trooped to the well.

 Earlier, Chatterjee had told the MPs who have disrupted Parliament over the nuclear deal that children are more disciplined than you.

 Daily, I will send somebody out, he had thundered at an MP, asking him to sit down.

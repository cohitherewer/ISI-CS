The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Govt, police in probe clash

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, March 22: One arm of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government doesnt seem to know what the other is doing.

 While Bengal advocate-general Balai Roy told Calcutta High Court today that the government had not issued any order asking the CID to probe the Nandigram firing, police said the department had taken up the investigation three days ago.

 Advocate Kalyan Banerjee raised the matter in the court, asking how the state government could order a CID probe when the high court had already ordered a CBI inquiry.

 Roy replied: The government has only asked the commissioner, Burdwan range, to inquire into the firing incident. As per the existing rules, the government has the power to conduct an executive probe in case of police firing.

 The division bench of acting Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghosh then asked the advocate-general to file an affidavit by Monday stating the governments stand on the question raised by Banerjee.

 But inspector-general (law and order) Raj Kanojia today said the CID was conducting an official probe. IG (western range) Arun Gupta seconded him, saying the CID has taken up both cases of police firing on March 14 at Bhangabera and at Adhikarypara. 

 In fact, the CID has also taken up investigation of a third case the discovery of arms and men from a nearby brick kiln, Gupta added. The CID today took the 10 men held from the brick kiln in their custody for four days.

 The CBI counsel handed a sealed report on the firing to the high court.

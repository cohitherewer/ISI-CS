 Fond memories of Calcutta

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 20: Mohammad Hamid Ansari, the UPA candidate for Vice-President, has fond memories of Calcutta.

 I was born and brought up in Calcutta. I studied in St Xaviers College for two years after completing my school education in Shimla, said Ansari, the UPA-Lefts nominee, from Delhi. 

 I stayed in Park Circus before going to Shimla for schooling. I had a great time in Calcutta, said the former diplomat who was born in 1937.

 After completing his FA equivalent to higher secondary in those days Ansari went to Aligarh Muslim University to pursue his graduation.

 I have fond memories of Calcutta. I moved to Aligarh Muslim University after studying at St Xaviers College for two years. 

 Ansari is now the chairperson of the National Commission for Minorities.

 Mohammed Salim, the CPM MP from Entally, was ecstatic. I am very happy as he stayed in my constituency. All Calcuttans should be proud of him as he spent his formative years here.

 Ansaris family hailed from Gazipur in Uttar Pradesh but his father worked in Calcutta. Like other families from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, his parents migrated to Calcutta for work. His family had also taken part in the freedom movement of the country, Salim added. 

 Ansari joined the Indian Foreign Service in 1961 and served as ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia. 

 Its a matter of pride for all of us as he went on to become New Delhis permanent representative at the United Nations in New York, he added. 

 Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim, who has had several interactions with Ansari, said: I met him in Saudi Arabia about 10 years ago. He is a scholarly man.

 As the news broke, the St Xaviers College alumni held a meeting at the institute. 

 Its a big day for all of us as a Xaverian has been nominated for the post of Vice-President. We are upbeat about it, said Imran Zaki Siddiqui, the honorary general secretary of St Xaviers College Calcutta Alumni Association. 

 Principal Father P.C. Matthew was elated. We are proud of him. It is a great honour for all of us and I congratulate him on behalf of the college.

 Wanna keep 2 wives? Do a Sholay

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Feb. 9: P. Santosh, a tailor in his early thirties, used the Sholay trick and came home with two wives.

 Santosh, a Gond tribal, shinnied up a wireless radio tower atop a two-storey police station in the northern Adilabad town and threatened to jump if Devata, 28, and Sangeeta, 24, refused to live under the same roof with him.

 Devata, his wife of four years, had filed a bigamy complaint after Santosh secretly married Sangeeta a year ago, and got him arrested. 

 We counselled Santosh to live with only one wife and let him off, T. Moses, the sub-inspector of Adilabad rural police station, said.

 Police in these parts leave it to tribal panchayats to settle disputes, avoiding stepping in unless there is violence. 

 Devata, too, was asked to go to the panchayat when she first approached the police. The panchayat then came back to the police because Santosh lives in a town, not a village.

 But after Santosh was sent home, Devata complained again that the ladies tailor was visiting Sangeeta in the neighbourhood too often. He was picked up on Wednesday and taken to the police station for another round of counselling. 

 Santosh gave policemen the slip and went to the terrace of the police station and climbed the wireless radio tower. 

 For over two hours, attempts to cajole him to come down failed. Like Veeru in Sholay who wouldnt climb down till he got Basantis hand, the tailor insisted his two wives must agree to live together if they did not want him to jump.

 Devata refused. But the police stepped in, telling her he would break his legs if he jumped and then she would have to look after an invalid husband and feed him for months. We told her that as a tribal woman who had led her husband to the jaws of death, she had no chances of any immediate remarriage either, said the police inspector.

 Polygamy is common among Gond tribals the wives all live in different houses, which the husband visits by rotation with the police turning a blind eye to it. If a wife complains of neglect, the tribal panchayat penalises the errant husband. 

 Not happy with having to share her husband and home with another woman, Devata is taking consolation that the chores will also be shared, giving her some leisure. 

 Sangeeta is happy that at least, I dont have to go in search of him when my turn comes.

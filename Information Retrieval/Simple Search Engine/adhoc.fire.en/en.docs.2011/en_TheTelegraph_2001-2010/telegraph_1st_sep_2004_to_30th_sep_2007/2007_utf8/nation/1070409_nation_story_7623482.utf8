 IIT exam simple, road ahead tough

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, April 8: The entrance examination to the Indian Institutes of Technology went off smoothly today, but the administrations caught in the quota crossfire between the judiciary and the government fear complications in starting the academic session on time.

 Two-and-a-half lakh students appeared for the IIT Joint Entrance Examination today, and the two three-hour papers were described by most as simpler than earlier years.

 IIT officials had a happy ring to their tone as well their biggest fear, the possibility of a paper leak, thankfully didnt come true.

 Things though, are only likely to get tougher from here on, with a cloud of uncertainty hanging over the fate of small boxes on each of the answer sheets. We have asked OBC students to mark the box. We will see later, depending on the final outcome, whether to use this information, said IIT Delhi director professor Surendra Prasad.

 But the question topmost on the minds of IIT administrators dealing with the admission process is: What now?

 Unlike the IIMs which have almost prepared the final list of successful candidates, based on the presumption of OBC reservation for this year todays IIT entrance tests were just the first step in their admission process. 

 The IITs start their academic session on August 1; the registration of candidates declared successful takes place during the last week of July. The results are, however, usually declared in May and the counselling begins mid-June.

 That may seem a long time away, but we keep this time precisely because a detailed evaluation of these lakhs of scripts by our faculty takes this much time, said Ravi Chattopadhay, the IIT Delhi admission in-charge.

 With the Centres directive to put the admission process for central institutes of higher learning on hold while it argues the quota matter in court, the IITs arent sure of how to go about selecting candidates. 

 We had kept a certain number of seats reserved for the OBC students. Now, we dont know whether we will increase seats. In the meantime, we cannot even process the answer scripts as the cut-off marks for OBC students was different than the cut-off for general category candidates, said a IIT Kanpur administrator.

 The feared outcome a delay in the start of the academic session.

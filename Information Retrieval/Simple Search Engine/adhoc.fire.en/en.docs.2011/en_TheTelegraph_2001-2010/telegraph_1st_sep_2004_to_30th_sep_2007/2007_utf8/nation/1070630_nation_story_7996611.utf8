 New Delhi, June 29: BJP leader L.K. Advani has appealed to the UPA to replace Pratibha Patil with any other suitable candidate for President.

 The NDA also submitted a petition to the Election Commission, on the eve of the last day of filing nominations, seeking action against the Congress for using undue influence on voters in the presidential election. 

 Advani insisted that none of the allegations against Pratibha was cooked up by the Opposition. A bank she founded is alleged to have been involved in financial irregularities and Pratibha herself has been accused of shielding her brother in a murder case.

 I appeal to you (Prime Minister Manmohan Singh), therefore, to once again consult your ministerial colleagues and leaders of the allies of your party and nominate any other suitable person for the presidential election, he said. 

 These revelations are of such grave nature that they completely and incontestably render the person unfit to occupy the highest constitutional office in the country.

 The leader of Opposition claimed that the revelations could be sourced to verifiable records of the RBI, other government agencies and memorandum submitted by the people affected by the scandals. 

 The NDA told the poll panel that the Congresss petition for the disqualification of Natwar Singh, a proposer to the nomination of Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, as a Rajya Sabha member showed that it was using pressure tactics to secure support for the UPA-Left candidate.

 We have sought appropriate action from the Election Commission, BJPs Sushma Swaraj, who submitted the complaint to election commissioner Navin Chawla, said.

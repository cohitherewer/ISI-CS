 Acid threat to actress

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 30: Mumbai police have launched a search for a man who has been making threatening phone calls to actress Kangana Ranaut.

 Kangana, who played a role based on Parveen Babis life in the Mahesh Bhatt-produced Woh Lamhe and has starred in Gangster, walked into Versova police station late last night to complain that a caller had threatened an acid attack on her.

 In her complaint, Kangana identified the stalker as Avinash Sharma, the man who had attacked the actresss younger sister Rangoli in their hometown Dehra Dun last October. The actress said in her complaint that Sharma had been harassing her with SMSes and phone calls for the last two weeks and had threatened to splash acid on her face if she did not fix his marriage with her sister.

 Though Kangana was unavailable for comment, her publicist said: This man has been harassing her for quite some time now. Kangana finally lodged a complaint when he threatened to splash acid. 

 The police have assured her that they would promptly investigate the matter. She has not sought police protection so far, but she could if the need arises.

 Additional commissioner of police (western region) Bipin Bihari told The Telegraph: We have recorded her statement. If you dont fix my marriage with your sister, I will throw acid on your face, too, is what the caller apparently threatened her in Hindi. We have the numbers of the caller, and our teams are investigating the case.

 Kangana was shooting for Suneel Darshans Shakalaka Boom Boom when she heard about the acid attack on Rangoli. Engaged and scheduled to be married last November, Rangoli was with friend Vijaya Chublani when a man splashed concentrated hydrochloric acid on her. Rangoli suffered burn injuries on her shoulder and face.

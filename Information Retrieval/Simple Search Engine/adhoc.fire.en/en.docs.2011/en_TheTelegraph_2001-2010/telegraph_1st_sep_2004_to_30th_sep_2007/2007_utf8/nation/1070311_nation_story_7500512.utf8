 Delhi rush to douse Valley fire

 New Delhi, March 10: As the distance between the Congress and its coalition partner the Peoples Democratic Party in Jammu and Kashmir continues to grow, chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad was summoned to Delhi for fire-fighting by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 The latest in the series of episodes highlighting the fissures in the ruling coalition was the PDPs boycott of the cabinet meeting convened by the chief minister yesterday. 

 The PDP kept away from the meeting to maintain pressure for its demands of demilitarisation in the militancy-hit areas and revocation of special powers to security forces.

 PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti had presented the partys demand before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who she had met earlier this month. 

 The party also raised the issue of getting agricultural and orchard land vacated. Some of these properties are occupied by the security forces.

 The demands are opposed by the Congress. Chief minister Azad has taken a hard line on the PDPs politics. After arriving in Delhi he went straight to the meeting with the Prime Minister. External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, who is playing the role of a trouble-shooter, also attended the meeting.

 The PDP wants Azad to convene a special cabinet meeting to discuss its demands. The party is also contemplating withdrawing support from the government if the demands are not met. Mehbooba said most of the coalition partners favour withdrawal of troops from Jammu and Kashmir. 

 The Congress and the PDP have opposite views on the major issue concerning state politics: the human rights violations by security forces. The number of people taken away by the forces has grown as skeletons have been tumbling out after widespread protests.

 The Centre wants Ghulam Nabi Azad to preserve the coalition. The party high command wants the government to accommodate some of the demands made by the PDP.

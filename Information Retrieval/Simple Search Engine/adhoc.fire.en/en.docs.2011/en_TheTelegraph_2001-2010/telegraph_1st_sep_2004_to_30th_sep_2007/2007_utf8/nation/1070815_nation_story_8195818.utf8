 Sonia seal on deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 14: Sonia Gandhi today defended the nuclear deal and the Prime Minister without any ifs and buts before party MPs.

 But the Congress president did not mention the standoff between Manmohan Singh and the Left, implying she wants to keep herself out of the picture while Singh and foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee try to resolve the spat.

 She, however, made one tangential allusion to it. Speaking at a meeting of the Congress parliamentary partys executive, Sonia mildly disapproved of the manner in which the Prime Minister was prevented from reading out his statement on the deal in Parliament yesterday.

 The nub of her statements was that the party must play an active role in explaining to the public the background of the agreement and the benefits it would bring.

 Sonia was keen not to project the deal as a private enterprise by Singh in which the party had no stakes.

 Our government has entered into this agreement after tough negotiations, she said, adding that it fulfilled all the assurances the Prime Minister had made in Parliament.

 I congratulate our Prime Minister and his team for this accomplishment, the Congress president said.

 The allusion to the standoff came in the middle of general comments on falling parliamentary standards.

 Sonia described parliamentary democracy as the most precious legacy bequeathed to us by our founding fathers, and said debates and discussions lay at its very core.

 There was a time when such debates, particularly in Parliament, stirred the entire nation. Sadly, today, disruptions and sloganeering appear to have taken over. The latest demonstration of this was just yesterday when the Prime Minister was not allowed to speak on the very important issue of our agreement on civilian nuclear cooperation.

 The twin endorsements first by the Congress Working Committee and now by Sonia means the party and the government are as strongly committed to the deal as the Left is opposed to it, senior Congress sources stressed.

 Two laws arising out of the agreement must be in place by the end of the year. 

 One will amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1962 to allow private players into the nuclear power sector. 

 The second will cap liability for foreign private companies doing business in nuclear energy.

 More kidney dupes pop up

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Jan. 20: Those fighting for survival after the tsunami are not the only ones who sold their kidneys. But revelations about the racket have prompted others to come out with complaints of being cheated.

 About 40 women, most of them shanty-dwellers in Thiruvallur, are believed to have been duped in the kidney sales. The case is now with polices crime branch.

 Some couples say brokers and middlemen promised Rs 1 lakh per kidney, but eventually paid only Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000.

 One such couple from north Chennai approached city police commissioner Lathika Saran yesterday.

 In their complaint, Siva and Malliga said they had been promised Rs 1.50 lakh two years back by a broker if they both sold a kidney each.

 They had the kidneys removed in a Madurai hospital, but on their return to Chennai, they received only Rs 30,000 and were asked to sign on a blank paper. There has been no trace of the middleman since.

 The loss of a kidney has weakened Siva, a daily-wage labourer, so much that he has had to stop working.

 Ten hospitals, including five in Chennai and one each in Madurai, Tiruchirappalli and Tirunelveli, are under the police scanner as part of the probe into the brokers-hospital nexus.

 The police have been insisting the sale of kidneys was not limited to Tsunami Nagar, a city area that is home to those displaced by the killer tides.

 However, none of the tsunami-hit people have filed a complaint. Commissioner Saran promised a comprehensive investigation, saying an organ-transplant panel headed by the state director of medical education would send a report so that complaints can be filed.

 Revenue officials in Thiruvallur have talked to some victims of the racket and submitted a report to the government.

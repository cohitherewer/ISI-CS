 Cash to spice up Chettinad legacy

 Middle-class India waits with bated breath when he rises to present the budget each February. But Chettinad is luckier. P. Chidambaram does not keep it guessing.

 The finance minister recently persuaded his colleagues in the Union cabinet to ladle out Rs 4.75 crore for a plan that aims to develop the regions famed architecture specimens and its sumptuous culinary heritage.

 Sivaganga, the Chettinad constituency that has been sending Chidambaram to Parliament for years now, will also benefit from the Centres largesse. Other places in the country, with as rich a tradition and as much potential to emerge as a tourist destination as the Tamil Nadu region, often have to struggle to secure similar grants.

 A CII report says protecting Chettinads mansions and palaces, and developing them into heritage tourism hotspots could require up to Rs 200 crore. Unesco has also drawn up a draft action plan and offered technical help to set up a Chettinad Heritage Museum. Chidambaram is pushing for these projects to get off the ground soon.

 Heritage heat is on

 Hyderabads heritage campaigners have upped the ante to give the citys ancient structures a fresh lease of life.

 They have demanded a fresh notification for conservation efforts. Also on the wish list is a demand to carry out a new survey of heritage sites and work out ways for their preservation since many of them are in poor shape. The last effort to identify them was made in 1998. 

 There were 137 heritage sites in the survey carried out over nine years ago. Now, almost 20 per cent of them are abandoned by owners unable to pay for repairs, said Ved Kumar of the Forum for a Better Hyderabad. 

 The Hyderabad Urban Development Authority, which oversees the preservation of heritage sites, has been urged to specify rules for occupants and visitors. The guidelines are provided in the heritage regulation act.

 Each heritage structure or place should have a plaque mentioning its history, Kumar said. Some abandoned sites, over 100 years old, have even turned into dens of anti-social elements with little policing.

 Blind justice for molester

 They cant see, but students of an institute for the visually challenged served the city an eye-opener about the predators lurking within.

 Narsingrao Shivajirao Dharamsi Industrial Home, a training institute in Worli, was ransacked recently over allegations that an employee sexually abused one of the inmates.

 Beni Thomas Vaaz, a clerk at the institute, allegedly abused an 18-year-old boy from Bengal and, showing little shame for his deeds, told him he would come back to visit him again. The lid was blown off the murky saga after the traumatised orphan told other students about it.

 Angry friends of the victim confronted the 48-year-old employee, beat him up and ensured that he was arrested. 

 Vaaz came to his room one evening, saying he would have to spend the night there as it was raining heavily and he couldnt return home. Later, Vaaz allegedly abused him and threatened to throw him out of the institute if he complained. 

 He tried to escape but we caught hold of him, said Bapu, one of those who pinned Vaaz down and handed him over to police.

 Safety first

 Two-wheeler riders and their companions in Chennai cant show off their wind-swept hair as if in a shampoo ad. The joyride is over. They will have to wear helmets.

 Madras High Court last week upheld a government order making it mandatory for drivers and pillion-riders to wear the protective device. The judges dismissed a plea against the February 2007 decree. They said the order doesnt limit freedom of movement.

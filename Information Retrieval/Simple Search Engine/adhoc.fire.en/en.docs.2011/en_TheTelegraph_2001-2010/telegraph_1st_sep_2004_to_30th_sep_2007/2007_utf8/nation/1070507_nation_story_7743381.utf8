 Lanka tax on foreign actors

 Colombo, May 6 (PTI): Sri Lanka has slapped a new tax on local film producers employing foreign actors in a move that could affect mainly Indian artistes who are becoming popular in this island.

 Filmmakers who employ foreign artistes for a lead role will have to pay Rs 250,000 for each movie from this month, chairman of the National Film Corporation Asoka Serasinghe said.

 Foreign stars in a supporting role will cost the producer Rs 150,000, he said.

 Indian Tamil film star Pooja Umashankar is acting in the local production Angalica and Mandira Bedi (in picture) is popular for her role in the teledrama Shanti that is dubbed in Sinhala by a local TV station.

 We have many talented artistes, technicians here, but local producers are bringing Indians and depriving our people of work, Serasinghe said.

 The tax does not apply to joint ventures and foreign films produced in Sri Lanka, he said.

 Currently there is an Indian actress, Pooja Umashankar whose mother is a Sri Lankan, being cast in lots of local films. We want to stop people like Pooja who are taking jobs away from locals, Serasinghe said.

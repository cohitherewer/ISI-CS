 Indo-US meet on defence

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 10: A Pentagon team today briefed Indian defence officials on Afghanistan and sought perceptions on Chinas moves to transform its military with large investments and a newly demonstrated ability to shoot down a satellite in space. 

 US deputy under-secretary of defence (Asian and Pacific Affairs) Richard P. Lawless headed the delegation at the first Indo-US defence joint working group meeting. 

 A defence ministry official said the talks touched on almost every aspect of defence ties from Indias perception of its neighbourhood as a volatile region to possible arms transfers to India by the US but was focused on laying the groundwork for a high-level meeting.

 The discussions were held in a friendly and cordial atmosphere, a defence ministry statement said.

 The official said the US team shared its understanding of the situation in Afgha-nistan. Although the Taliban has been threatening large-scale attacks in the summer, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force had deployed more troops. 

 The US is also believed to have shared its understanding of Chinas anti-satellite test.

 The Indian side was led by Shilbhadra Banerjee, the director general (acquisitions).

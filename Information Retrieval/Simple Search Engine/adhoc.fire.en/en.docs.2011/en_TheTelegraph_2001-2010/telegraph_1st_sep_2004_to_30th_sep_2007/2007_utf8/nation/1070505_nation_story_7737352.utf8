 Happy Home in CID glare

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai/Alappuzha, May 4: From Ishrat Jahan Raza to Sohrabuddin Sheikh, police kept targeted fake-encounter victims in a Gandhinagar farmhouse before gunning them down, the Gujarat CID said today.

 Sohrabuddin, who was killed in a fake encounter, and his wife Kauser Bi, who was a witness to the incident and is believed to have been bumped off by the police, had been detained in the Happy Home farmhouse in Gandhinagar. 

 Raju Jariwala, the owner of the farmhouse, has confessed to seeing at least four persons, including Ishrat, being held there for days by anti-terrorist squad chief D.G. Vanzara and his team, CID officials said. Jariwalas brother Surendra is a BJP councillor.

 The revelation has brought a ray of hope for Ishrats family in Mumbra, a Thane suburb. 

 The 19-year-old college student was killed in 2004 after she was accused of plotting to assassinate chief minister Narendra Modi along with Lashkar-e-Toiba operatives.

 Since the encounter, her family has been claiming that she was killed in a fake encounter. We hope that now at least Ishrats encounter will be probed thoroughly, her elder sister Zeenat said.

 Zeenat said her sister had left for Ahmedabad for a job three days before her death along with Javed Sheikh, who lived in Pune. Javed never came to our house, but Ishrat knew him. He was a marketing executive in a soap and coffee manufacturing firm. 

 In Kerala, Javeds father, too, is looking to wash the terror taint off his son.

 Javed, known as Pranesh Kumar Pillai before he converted to marry a Muslim girl, was a resident of Thamarakulam in Alappuzha district.

 His father M.R. Gopinathan Pillai said that after Javeds death, he had gone to Ahmedabad, where many people told him his son had been killed in a fake encounter. 

 But Pillai did not have the wherewithal to pursue the case. He has now asked daughter-in-law Sajida to move Bombay High Court for a CBI inquiry.

 What hurts the 75-year-old widower most is the police branding his son a terrorist. My son could never be that. Its true he had embraced another religion to marry the girl of his choice, Pillai said.

 Pillai had to bring Javeds eldest son Abubacker to Kerala after the child failed to get admission to any Pune school. Javed has two other children, Sadaf and Moosa.

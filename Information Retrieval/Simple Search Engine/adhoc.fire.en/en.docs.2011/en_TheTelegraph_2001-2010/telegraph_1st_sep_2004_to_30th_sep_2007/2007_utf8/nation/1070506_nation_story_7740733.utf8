 Alistair judge puts in papers

 Pareira

 Mumbai, May 5: The judge who let off businessmans son Alistair Pareira with a six-month term after he ran over and killed seven people resigned today.

 Additional sessions judge Ajit Mishra sent his resignation to state Chief Justice Swatanter Kumar two days after Bombay High Court criticised the trial court and the prosecution, court sources said.

 On May 3, Chief Justice Kumar and Justice S.C. Dharmadhikari had taken suo motu notice of the controversial judgment and ordered city police chief Dhananjay Jadhav to personally probe the loopholes in the police investigation. The judges had also indicated they would study the legality and propriety of the judgment.

 An allegedly drunken Pareira, 21, had run his Toyota Corolla over 15 pavement-dwellers last November, killing seven and injuring eight, while returning from a late-night binge with friends.

 He was last month cleared of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which carries 10 years, for lack of evidence and convicted only of rash and negligent driving and causing hurt. Mishra had rapped the police for poor investigation.

 The high court judges have asked Jadhav to probe why the prosecution hadnt questioned the six friends who were with the accused. They also wanted to know how Pareira managed to pay up the Rs 5-lakh compensation in cash within 30 minutes of Mishras judgment.

 Legal circles are also asking why Mishra didnt give Pareira two years, the maximum punishment for rash and negligent driving.

 Its difficult to know the exact reason for Mishras resignation. Its possible he feared strictures from the high court, leading criminal lawyer Majeed Memon said.

 He said that during the trial, Mishra had the option of pulling up the prosecution and the police and asking them to investigate the case properly.

 The case was riddled with botch-ups. The police photographer said the pictures of the hit-and-run site that were produced in court werent the ones he had clicked.

 Although he then admitted to having left his glasses behind, throwing doubt on his testimony, the prosecution never got him back on the stand.

 The police failed to furnish medical evidence that Pareira was drunk despite having collected blood and urine samples immediately after the incident.

 PM agents vs inspector

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, April 21: The Centre will appoint a group of key officials, to be called agents of change, to speed up planned reforms in the countrys creaking system of governance, the Prime Minister said today.

 The move is aimed at ending the Inspector Raj a label for the rule of obstructive, inefficient and corrupt officials that archaic procedures have spawned, Manmohan Singh added.

 These (agents of change) would be public-oriented personnel of outstanding calibre and would be strategically located to engineer reforms. They would be free from departmental baggage and work on a full-time basis within the system to deliver results, the Prime Minister told a gathering of top bureaucrats on Civil Service Day.

 Singh didnt specify how these officials would function. Sources merely said they would identify the problems that slow down the implementation of reforms in a particular area and work to remove them.

 I wonder how much longer a creaking system can go (on). While economic reforms abolished Licence Raj, complaints of Inspector Raj persist in fact, they may be getting louder, he said.

 We need to design ways in which we can re-engineer government processes, just as our private sector has re-engineered itself to become world class.

 The Prime Minister said that recruiting talented officials and buying better technology cannot improve performance and service delivery beyond a point if we continue to be prisoners of archaic procedures and processes.

 Its because government processes couldnt be reformed at all that governance stays hostage to the Inspector Raj, he said.

 He hoped that once the agents of change are put in place, the results would quickly be visible.

 Singh came down heavily on the slowness of the reforms process. 

 Reforming the government would require out of the box thinking, he said.

 I view the reform of government as a means of making citizens central to all government activities and reorganising government to effectively address the concerns of our people, he added.

 Cabinet secretary B.K. Chaturvedi had discussed the proposal at the chief secretaries convention yesterday. The appointments are likely to come soon, sources said.

 Singh presented the Prime Ministers Awards for Excellence in Public Administration to Rajiv Chawla, secretary (e-governance) to the Karnataka government, and R.S. Pandey, secretary to the steel ministry and former chief secretary of Nagaland.

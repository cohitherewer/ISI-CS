 Ahmedabad, March 30: Three more lions have been found dead in the Gir sanctuary, three km from the Babariya forest range where three carcasses were found earlier this month, reports our correspondent.

 Forest officials have registered a case under the Wildlife Protection Act. They said the animals were possibly killed five days ago in the sanctuary, the only habitat of the Asiatic lion. The case will be investigated by the CID.

 The viscera of the two lions and one cub have been sent to the Junagadh forensic laboratory to ascertain whether they had been poisoned or electrocuted. The skins of the carcasses have been removed, making the job difficult. 

 The modus operandi seems to be have been the same as in the earlier case, said forest conservator Bharat Pathak. 

 On March 3, the carcasses of two lionesses and a cub were found near the Babariya forest range headquarters.

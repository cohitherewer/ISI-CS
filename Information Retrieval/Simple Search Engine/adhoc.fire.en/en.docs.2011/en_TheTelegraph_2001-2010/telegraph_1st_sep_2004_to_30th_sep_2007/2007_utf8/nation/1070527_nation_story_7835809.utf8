 Buddha firm on industry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 26: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today made it clear that the Nandigram violence would not make his government give up efforts to boost industry in the state.

 We just cannot roll back what we have started, he told reporters, while briefing them on his meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday.

 The chief minister said the hunt for an alternative site for a chemical hub earlier proposed to be set up in Nandigram was on. 

 Indian Oil Corporation is proposed to be the leading investor in the hub, part of a larger petroleum, petrochemical and chemical zone. Indonesias Salim Group will also invest in the special economic zone and the Centre will help set up infrastructure.

 The Bengal government abandoned plans of setting up the hub in Nandigram following resistance from residents, which strengthened after the March 14 police firing that killed 14.

 Delhi is reported to have urged the Bhattacharjee government to pick a new location as soon as possible, as other states, too, are interested in the project. The chief minister has written to political parties seeking suggestions. During his trip to the capital this time, Bhattacharjee asked the Centre to give him some more time.

 Bhattacharjee stressed the need for an immediate resolution in Nandigram, where the normal life has been disrupted. The first round of an all-party meet on Thursday failed to end the stalemate after Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee staged a walkout.

 The chief minister wondered if there was any reason for the existence of the Trinamul-led Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee as plans to acquire land in Nandigram have been dropped.

 He said the state government had hoped that the all- party meeting would help bring normality to the battle zone. 

 During his meeting with the Prime Minister, Bhattacharjee also made a pitch for a Rs 4,500-crore aid from the Centre for rural electrification. The state government has already submitted a detailed project report on how Rs 2,600 crore can be spent.

 Eviction lash for Centre amp; two states

 New Delhi, Aug. 2 (PTI): The Supreme Court today slammed the Centre and two states Andhra Pradesh and Bihar for failing to evict unauthorised occupants from government quarters and recover penal rents from those evicted.

 If you fail to act we will issue a notice to the Speaker, a bench of Justices B.N. Aggrawal and P.P. Naolekar told government counsel Wasim Quadri.

 The bench made the observation while expressing dissatisfaction over an affidavit filed by the Centre that failed to explain the position vis-a-vis the reported unauthorised occupation of 30 quarters allotted to MPs under the legislators pool.

 The Centre has been given six weeks to file a detailed affidavit on the illegally occupied houses and the steps taken for recovering penal rents.

 With regard to the unauthorised occupation by government officials, the bench reiterated its earlier observation that such bureaucrats should be suspended and their properties and bank FDRs attached. 

 They may be senior IAS officers, judicial officers or MLAs, put them behind bars. IAS officers do not enjoy any immunity from law, the bench told the Andhra Pradesh government.

 The court did not spare Bihar either. 

 When its counsel could not explain the whereabouts of 180 people who the government claimed were evicted and said they vanished, the bench retorted: How can so many persons vanish at a time.... If they are government servants then suspend them immediately.

 American embassy up for grabs

 - Mission in London set to shift

 The US embassy in London

 London, May 2: Indian tycoons wanting a spacious London apartment with a prestigious address should keep an eye out for the US embassy in Grosvenor Square which is being put up for sale with a price tag of 90 million. 

 Mall king K.P. Singh, the 75-year-old chairman of DLF, one of the worlds fastest growing real estate companies, has a tastefully furnished flat in Grosvenor Square. 

 The style of his apartment is so quintessentially English, with its deep sofas, silver-framed family photographs and open windows letting in spring sunshine, that it could be the set for a Noel Coward play. Only the paintings by well-known Indian artists Singh is an enthusiastic collector and glossy books on Bollywood reveal their owners origins. 

 The businessman and one-time newspaper owner Suresh Nanda, the son of former navy chief S.M. Nanda, has entertained generously in his Grosvenor Square flat. So have other Indians, among them rich Sindhis from Nigeria and Hong Kong, who own properties in one of the most exclusive squares in London. 

 Shekhar Kapur has a place just off Grosvenor Square another hit and the director of Bandit Queen and Elizabeth could move into the square where prices for flats probably begin in excess of 5 million. 

 The trouble for the residents of Grosvenor Square is that it also houses the massive US embassy. Despite the spring sunshine, one aspect of the square looks forbidding and unattractive because concrete piles laid across blocked roads protect the embassy in case any suicide bomber is tempted to drive a truck laden with explosives into the building. 

 The US has had an embassy in Grosvenor Square since the late 18th century. But this building, which has been an embassy since the 1960s and where would-be visitors to America now queue for visas, has quite a bit of history. It has a strong connection to the US military as General Dwight Eisenhower worked here in the 1940s while planning the invasion of North Africa during the Second World War. 

 In 1968, the embassy was the focus of fierce anti-Vietnam riots that brought to the fore a radical young Pakistani by the name of Tariq Ali (now an eminently respectable establishment figure). The embassy had to be protected by baton-wielding mounted police. 

 Times have changed but only for the worse. After the attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the Twin Towers in New York, security at the London mission a high-profile target of al Qaida understandably had to be strengthened. 

 The sale of the building with 133,300 sq ft of space is part of a global disposal of US embassies, ambassadorial residences and other diplomatic buildings with staff set to be moved to more secure locations and multi-purpose compounds. 

 The winning bidder will have 939 years left on the 999-year lease. One possibility is for the embassy to be turned into a five-star hotel. The US bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations, which manages more than 3,500 US government properties in 193 countries, is running the global sell-off. 

 It has been reported that the US is considering moving to a property in Isleworth in west London or south of the Thames in Greenwich. Thats a little like moving from Ballygunge to the suburbs. 

 An embassy spokesperson said it was pursuing alternatives that could possibly lead to the relocation of the embassy in London sfrom its current location at 24, Grosvenor Square, to provide a modern secure facility for this important mission. 

 We are looking at potentially viable sites that could be acquired for new construction but thats just one option, he said. 

 If all else fails, one of the alternatives may be to remain in place and upgrade the facilities. 

 The embassys Navy Annexe, the US Navys former UK offices, is also in the square, and was recently put on the market for over 100 million.

 RSS support for Left

 New Delhi, Aug. 25 (PTI): The Left has received support for its opposition to the nuclear deal from unexpected quarters, with the RSS saying its stand on the 123 Agreement is justified.

 Whatever be the explanation for the Congress partys new-found arrogance, the Left is justified in its posturing, an editorial in the Sangh mouthpiece, Organiser, said.

 This came after BJP leader L.K. Advanis unsuccessful attempt to seek the Lefts support for his partys call for a vote in Parliament on the agreement.

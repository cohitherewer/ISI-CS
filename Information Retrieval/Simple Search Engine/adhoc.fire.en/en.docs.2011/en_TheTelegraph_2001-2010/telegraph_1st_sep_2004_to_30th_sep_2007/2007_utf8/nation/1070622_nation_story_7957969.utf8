The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Times up, says UPA 

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, June 21: The UPA trashed President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams efforts to seek a second term.

 If NCP chief Sharad Pawar used an analogy from cricket, and not politics, to decry Kalams move, RJDs Lalu Prasad tried to be statesman-like and counselled the President to leave Rashtrapati Bhavan with dignity. 

 DMK chief M. Karunanidhi, who signed the first set of UPA candidate Pratibha Patils nomination papers as a proposer yesterday, refused to fall for the Tamil card flashed by Jayalalithaa and Vaiko, who were among Kalams prime sponsors. 

 The Left rebuffed the third fronts overture to back its nominee.

 Two days before Patil would file her nomination, the ruling camp was gung-ho at the prospect of a divided Opposition and, more so, a confused BJP, which was apparently caught between the expediency of doing long-term business with the third front and propping up its own candidate, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat.

 The match is over for Kalam, pronounced Pawar. The Union agriculture minister spoke of feeling pity for Kalam. He will neither be in the team nor in the first 15 nor on the ground. 

 Another Union minister, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi appointed Patils chief election officer by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi said: The most unfortunate, unexpected and uncalled-for comments have been offered by Rashtrapati Bhavan sources to the media about the certainty of victory. The English word consensus is always something arrived at between parties outside Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 When the Prime Minister and the largest stakeholders of the party in power and the supporting parties proposed the candidacy (of Patil) and it was signed by no less than the UPA chairperson and the Prime Minister, to talk of certainty is most uncalled for.

 He said when Manmohan Singh met Kalam on Tuesday to brief him on the G8 summit, he informed the President of the UPA nominee and virtually said farewell by thanking him for his support to the government.

 Patil submitted her resignation as Rajasthan governor to the President today.

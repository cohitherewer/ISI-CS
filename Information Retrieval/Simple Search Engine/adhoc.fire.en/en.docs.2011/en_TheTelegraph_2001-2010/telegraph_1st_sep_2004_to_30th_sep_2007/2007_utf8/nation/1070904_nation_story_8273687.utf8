 Baby safe, not parents

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Chandigarh, Sept. 3: Ankush may be safe in his mothers lap, but his parents arent.

 Pawan and Kavita continue to live under the shadow of threats a day after their baby was reunited with them. 

 The infant was snatched by a village panchayat in Karnal district that annulled the couples marriage because they are from the same gotra (clan). Police found Ankush last evening with a woman who had been handed the baby by members of the Katalhedi village council.

 Six members of the khap panchayat a traditional council of elders distinct from an elected panchayat have been booked on charges of kidnapping and criminal intimidation.

 But the fears havent gone away. Kavitas family has supported the panchayats decision to annul her marriage, has vowed to kill the couple and commit suicide. 

 We are taking their threats seriously and will take stern action. The couples safety and security remains a concern as similar cases ended in deaths, a Karnal officer said.

 But Pawan has had enough. I will like to go back to Mumbai as soon as possible. The way caste panchayats are behaving in Haryana, it is better to stay in a society that is civilised.

 Kavita, too, appeared traumatised and in no shape to return home. I have got my baby and husband back. But I would not like to go back to the village. I hope and pray that no woman undergoes the trauma I went through.

 For Karnal police chief A.S. Chawla, who rescued the baby from Oindh, another village in the same district, there might be some reason for satisfaction. 

 We had to take precautions because we did not want any harm to come to the baby. We have handed him over to the mother, who is legally and morally the first claimant. 

 Chawlas leave was cut short on Sunday after the Congress high command intervened in the matter and asked Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda to trace Ankush and hand him over to his parents. 

 Till then, the Karnal authorities had failed to take any action. 

 The Katalhedi khap panchayat had defended its decision. Being from the same gotra, they are brother and sister. They cannot be husband and wife. We will not allow this, one member had said, justifying the babys separation from his parents. Pawan was forced to tie a Rakhi on Kavita and asked to pay a fine of Rs 65,000.

 Bengal land note for CPM meet

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Bhattacharjee: Brief ready

 Calcutta, Jan. 1: Controversy over land acquisition across the country will figure at the CPM central committee meeting that begins tomorrow at the Bengal party headquarters in Calcutta, politburo member Sitaram Yechury said today.

 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, industries minister Nirupam Sen and state party secretary Biman Bose did some homework today for briefing the committee members on the Singur conflict.

 They prepared a comprehensive note on the governments acquisition, compensation and rehabilitation policy for farmers whose land is taken over for industry in the state. The note will form the basis of the briefing, party insiders said.

 The CPM politburo met at Alimuddin Street this evening to finalise the agenda for the three-day central committee meeting. Apart from land acquisition, the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Uttaranchal, and the increasing factional feud in the CPMs Kerala unit are on the menu. 

 We will consider all these political organisational matters, Yechury said.

 According to some central committee members, CPM units in states like Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu have sought clarifications on Bengals land-for-industry policy. 

 They would like to ask questions on the Bengal scenario as rivals are accusing the CPM of doublespeak on land acquisition in other states. The Andhra unit has already referred to the politburo the state Congresss campaign against us, citing Bengal, to counter our opposition to its governments acquisition of agricultural land there, a CPM central secretariat member said. 

 However, the Bhattacharjee governments stand has already earned the endorsement of the politburo. 

 The partys critics as well as partners are complaining that it is not practising in Bengal what it is preaching in Delhi and elsewhere against acquisition of farmland for special economic zones and other industry hubs. 

 Allies like the CPI, RSP and the Forward Bloc have been asking for a uniform land policy of the Left across the country. However, CPM politburo member Brinda Karat told The Telegraph yesterday that the party did not see any reason to take a fresh look at its land policy. Our policy on the land issue is already clear, she said. 

 CPM central secretariat member and Bengal MP Hannan Mollah echoed her. The policy on industrialisation was finalised at the time of the last party congress in 2005. The land acquisition drive is a corollary to that and we had articulated our policy on it in four Left parties notes on SEZs. Although we wanted to avoid agricultural land in principle, the policy allows flexibility according to land availability in states, he said.

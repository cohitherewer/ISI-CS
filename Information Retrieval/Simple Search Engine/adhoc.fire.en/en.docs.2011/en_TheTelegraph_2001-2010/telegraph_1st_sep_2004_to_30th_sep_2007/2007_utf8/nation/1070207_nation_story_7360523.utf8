 Another whack at adult TV

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: Want to watch adult programmes on television? Better get insomnia.

 Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has decided to crack the whip on a couple of channels that beam adult content during the day. Addressing the annual editors conference on social sector issues yesterday, Das Munshi said he would ask them to at least shift such programmes between 11.00 pm and 5 am.

 Let them (viewers) have sleepless nights, he joked.

 The minister was replying to a reporter who pointed out that many television programmes denigrate women. I am sick of seeing these kinds of things on various private channels, he said. I would be very tough in this matter.

 Das Munshi reminded his audience that when he had recently banned AXN for two months for showing a programme titled Worlds Sexiest Commercials he was accused of moral policing.

 Separate time-slots for programmes more suitable for adults might go down well with the entertainment industry.

 For example, when the AXN ban controversy broke, adman Prahlad Kakkar had suggested something similar.

 A committee appointed by I amp;B ministry which includes representatives from the entertainment industry to evolve a content code has also debated the idea.

 Asked about sting operations, the Das Munshi said the issue could figure in the comprehensive broadcast bill now being drafted in consultation with the industry.

 The Broadcasting Services Regulation Bill, 2006, will be introduced during the year, the minister said but hinted that it might not happen in the coming budget session. 

 He reiterated that it would be a media-friendly bill more concerned media freedom than similar legislation even in countries like Britain and the US.

 But the UPA government at the Centre has no plans of allowing news broadcast on private FM radio stations. At least not in my tenure, Das Munshi said.

 The government is also considering an export promotion council for the entertainment industry to help sell Indian films abroad, the minister said. Proposals from Hollywood institutes on tie-ups with premier Indian film institutes on teaching the technical aspects of filmmaking were being looked at, he added.

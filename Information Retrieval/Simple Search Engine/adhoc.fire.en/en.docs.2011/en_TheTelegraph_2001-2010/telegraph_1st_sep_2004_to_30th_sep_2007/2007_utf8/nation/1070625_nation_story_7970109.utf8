 Kidnap in Gujarat, rescue in Orissa

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, June 24: Little Pranshu Siroyas ordeal has ended after seven long days and hundreds of miles away from home.

 A joint team from Orissa and Gujarat police today rescued the 18-month-old from near a temple in Panasbast, a remote village in Khurda, seven days after he had been kidnapped from Surat.

 The abductor, Rushi Swain, had apparently got wind that the police were hot on his trail and left the toddler, whose father is a diamond merchant, at a paan shop this morning before fleeing.

 We have rescued the boy and are taking him back today. He seems to be missing his parents, said Bijayshree Jadeja, the CID inspector from Gujarat who led the team.

 The police are still looking for Rushi. They have detained his brother Basant Swain and brother-in-law Bijay Srichandan.

 Rushi, 25, who worked as a watchman in the apartment complex where the Siroyas live, is from Gopalpur village, 30 km from here. The police had initially raided his village, but apparently Rushi had come straight to Panasbast, where his sister-in-law Sukanti lived.

 Soldiers promised a raise

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Thiruvananthapuram, Dec. 31: Defence minister A.K. Antony has promised the armed forces a fair deal in the new pay commission.

 Antony, on his maiden visit to the Southern Air Command today, said the last pay commission had been unjust to defence personnel. 

 Our soldiers and scientists deserve better pay. Im personally convinced about it, and this is the considered opinion of the defence ministry. We will soon take effective steps to raise this as a special case with the pay commission for enhancing the pay of defence personnel, including scientists working at various facilities.

 Higher salaries and better service conditions for those guarding the borders were the norm in other countries in view the harsh nature of their job, the minister pointed out. Were able to sleep in peace because they keep vigil on the border. Therefore, we need to take better care of them.

 Antony said there was relative peace on the India-Pakistan border but President Pervez Musharraf should show more sincerity by discouraging infiltration. Infiltration has come down in Kashmir but there was cause for concern on the Nepal and Bangladesh borders, he added.

 The minister resolved to make defence purchases more transparent by allowing a committee headed by him to take major decisions. But that would in no way affect the pace of arms acquisition or combat readiness of the forces. Therell be greater speed in buying new weapons and machines and youll see this happening soon, he said.

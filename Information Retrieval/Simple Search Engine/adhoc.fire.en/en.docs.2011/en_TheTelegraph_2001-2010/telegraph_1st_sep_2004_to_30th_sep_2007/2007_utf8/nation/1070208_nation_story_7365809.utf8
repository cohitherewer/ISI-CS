 Court rap for Husain probe delay

 New Delhi, Feb. 7 (PTI): A court today pulled up Delhi police for dragging their feet on investigating a complaint against M.F. Husain for allegedly portraying Hindu gods and goddesses in an indecent manner and hurting religious feelings.

 Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Kamini Lau, criticising the police for its failure to file the probe report, said: Do you want the people to come on to the streets? Why are you dragging your feet?

 The police have been asked to conclude the investigation by February 12 and file the chargesheet.

 The court was infuriated when a police officer sought more time to file the investigation report, which was to be submitted today.

 The magistrate had given the directive on February 3 after Connaught Place assistant commissioner of police G.L. Mehta told the court that not only would the investigation be completed but he would personally ensure the filing of the final report before the court by February 7.

 The court also summoned Husain and socialite Nafisa Ali for a March 6 hearing of a similar complaint registered in Indore. The case has been transferred here following a Supreme Court order.

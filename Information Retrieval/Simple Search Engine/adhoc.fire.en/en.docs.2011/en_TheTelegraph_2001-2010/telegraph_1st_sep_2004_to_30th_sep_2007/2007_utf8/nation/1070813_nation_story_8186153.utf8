 Stephens boys, better get back by 10pm

 New Delhi, Aug. 12: St Stephens College has decided to crack the whip on students who stay out late at night following dwindling attendance in its early morning classes that start at 8.40. 

 Authorities at the elite college have dusted a rule as old as the institute to issue a diktat asking all boys staying in the hostels to be back in their rooms by 10pm.

 The rule has rarely been enforced in the institutes 126-year-old history.

 The college has also decided that hostel students, who now need 66 per cent attendance, will from next year need to attend 80 per cent classes or give up their rooms. 

 Students just arent coming to classes in the mornings. And that is because they are up late at night. We had to take some step. The 10 clock deadline has been there in the college rulebook since the start. It has just never been enforced for boys till now, dean Nandita Narain told The Telegraph.

 The joke doing the rounds in the college, though, is that the late-night ultimatum is the colleges way of levelling the extent of nocturnal freedom available to boys and girls. 

 Girls at St Stephens have always had to strictly adhere to the 10pm deadline, with matrons only too willing to peep into each room to check if the bed was empty, leading to frequent cries of unequal laws for the two sexes. 

 Students say there is virtually no way the rule can be implemented for boys.

 I honestly dont think its at all practical to observe the 10 clock rule for boys. It just wont work, said Chandy Oommen, the president of the Students Union Society of the college.

 Chandy is the son of former Kerala chief minister Oommen Chandy.

 Not that the diktat will help increase attendance even if it were implemented, say students. 

 We can continue partying in our rooms till well after 10pm. That isnt allowed, according to the college handbook, but it has always been managed. If Im drinking or chatting with my friends till 3am, I wont be able to make it to the morning class whether Im partying at a club, or in my room, one student, who wished to remain anonymous, said. 

 Queah Miguel believes the college authorities are wrong in their assessment that attendance is declining in morning classes. 

 The majority of students in residence (Stephanian lingo for the hostel) do turn up on time for the morning classes. Only three to four in each class dont, said the final-year student of history, who hopes to replace Chandy as president of the Students Union Society this year.

 The increase in attendance criteria from 66 to 80 per cent is worrying students more, with many calling it a boarding school tactic.

 We are after all college students. We ought to be treated like college students. The attendance requirements were high enough already... raising them further is crazy, said one student.

 College authorities, however, say the new strictures will only help the students and not just academically.

 Students end up becoming addicted to alcohol and drugs. It becomes difficult to help them then. It is better to nip the problem in the bud, Narain said.

 And if they do not appreciate the hostel accommodation they have, why not give it to someone else. We face a perennial problem of shortage in hostel seats, she added.

 The college has six hostels four for boys and two for girls with a total capacity of around 300.

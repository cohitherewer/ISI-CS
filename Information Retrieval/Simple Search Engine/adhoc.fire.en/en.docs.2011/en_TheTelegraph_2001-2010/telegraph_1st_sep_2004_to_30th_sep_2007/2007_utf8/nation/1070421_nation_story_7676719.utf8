 CBI proof deadline in Q case

 New Delhi, April 20 (PTI): An Argentinian court has asked the CBI to give fresh evidence, if any, by April 26 so that arguments on its request to extradite Bofors accused Ottavio Quattrocchi could begin.

 A communication received at the CBI headquarters from Buenos Aires says the court in El Dorado has issued a notice to the investigative agencys lawyer to examine all the documents submitted by Quattrocchi and submit its reply and any further evidence within next five working days.

 The April 18 order by the First Court of El Dorado in Misiones province was given yesterday. 

 The CBI has begun hectic consultations with its legal experts here as well as with those appointed in Argentina. After this process, the court is to set the date for the start of arguments on the CBIs extradition plea.

 The hearing for the extradition of Quattrocchi to India had begun in the Argentinian court on March 23. The Italian businessman has opposed the move, saying it is a political case. Quattrochi is at present out on bail but has been asked by Argentinian authorities to confine himself to Buenos Aires.

 Effort to speed up Rajiv probe

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 13: A two-member special CBI team probing the conspiracy behind Rajiv Gandhis assassination visited Sri Lanka last month to hasten investigations, it was revealed today.

 The Multi-Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MDMA) sought information on the LTTEs network from Sri Lankan authorities. 

 Efforts to speed up the probe come a month before the term of the agency, which has been getting extensions since the May 1991 assassination, expires.

 The main problem has been lack of co-operation from countries where the LTTEs network is active. Letters asking for information on the funding of the terror group have been sent to 17 countries, including Switzerland, Australia, Singapore and Germany.

 But only some have responded. Even these countries have set conditions that the information should not be misused. Other nations sought guarantees that the inputs would not be used to secure a death sentence for the accused.

 Sri Lanka has been the least co-operative, said officials, adding the country was sent such a letter on April 23, 2001. 

 The Jain Commission, whose report on the former Prime Ministers assassination was handed in 10 years back, said 21 suspects in the case are Sri Lankans. The CBI wants the Sri Lankan authorities to provide information about their whereabouts.

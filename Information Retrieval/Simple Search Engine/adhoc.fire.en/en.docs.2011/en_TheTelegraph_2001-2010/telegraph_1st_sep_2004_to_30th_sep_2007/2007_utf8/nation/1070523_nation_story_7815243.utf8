 Maya sanction shield

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 22: The CBI has not been able to get the governors sanction to prosecute Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati in the Taj corridor scam even a day before the case comes up for hearing in Lucknow.

 The agency will now bank on the trial courts order to take the case forward. Senior officials in the Mayavati government have indicated that the court would first have to establish if there is a prima facie case against the chief minister.

 The officials said the court should take a decision after going through the report filed by the CBI. The question of sanction would come later, they added.

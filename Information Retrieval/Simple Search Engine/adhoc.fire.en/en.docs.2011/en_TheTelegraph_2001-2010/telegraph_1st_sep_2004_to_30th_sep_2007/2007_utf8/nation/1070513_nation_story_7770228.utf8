 Watch it! Card couriers can gyp you

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 At Risk?

 New Delhi, May 12: A signature against your name on an innocuous looking list the courier boy thrusts forward could leave you staring at payments as high as your credit card limit permits.

 And the next time you hand over your credit card to a petrol pump official or a salesman, you could be setting yourself to receive a huge bill for a purchase you never made.

 Despite complaints from customers and appeals by police, banks continue to print the crucial card verification value (CVV) number on the card itself, making fraud easier for couriers and salesmen.

 In the first four months of this year, Delhi police registered 109 cases of credit card fraud where they believe couriers, petrol pump officials or salesmen could be involved.

 On two occasions, the Delhi police economic offences wing requested banks to devise a safer way to communicate the CVV number but not one bank has changed its policy, a senior officer of the wing said.

 The dilemma that faces victims of credit card frauds technically, if someone has forged their signature while making purchases, the card-owner could be charged with fraud forces many to stay away from the police.

 Sanjay Kumar Srivastava said he had chosen to pay up rather than go to the police. The deputy general manager at the air traffic control tower (ATC) of the Indira Gandhi International Airport became the victim of a courier boy who delivered one credit card but asked his wife to sign at two places.

 I had applied for two ICICI cards but only one was delivered. The second signature was in lieu of the card that never came, he said. ICICI Bank sent him an SMS on December 7 informing him that the cards would reach him in 10 days. When the second card did not arrive after 15 days, Srivastava called up the bank, which said it would look into the matter.

 Finally, he decided to cancel the second card, fearing it might be misused. Bank officials told him they would cancel the card. The conversation between Srivastava and the bank is recorded on the ATCs office phone.

 On receiving an SMS from ICICI informing him that he would have to pay up Rs 10,700 for a purchase made at a Gurgaon electronics store using the missing credit card on January 9, a furious Srivastava called up the bank.

 Thats when the shock came. Not only had they failed to cancel the card, they claimed they had no records of my asking them to cancel the card, he said. The bank, he added, conducted an internal inquiry but refused to hear the phone tapes.

 An ICICI Bank official, who was part of the inquiry and did not want to be named, confirmed Srivastavas version but said the decision to not consider the tapes was office policy.

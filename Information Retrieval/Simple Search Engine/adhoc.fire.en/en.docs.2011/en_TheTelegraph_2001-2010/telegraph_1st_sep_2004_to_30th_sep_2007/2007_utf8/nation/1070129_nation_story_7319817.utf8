 Gurus golden touch too hot for Ford

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Too Dear: Abhishek Bachchan

 Mumbai, Jan. 28: Last year, papa Bachchan and Star Plus took a mutually amicable call to freeze ties over Kaun Banega Crorepati. Today, beta Bachchan and Ford India did much the same with the Fiesta.

 The global car major today announced that it would not be renewing its December 2005 endorsement deal with Abhishek Bachchan, which expired last month.

 Scott McCormack, Ford Indias vice-president, marketing, confirmed as much. We have not renewed the endorsement deal with Abhishek Bachchan, agencies quoted him as saying.

 The industry buzz is that Abhishek has ratcheted up his brand endorsement fees, riding the success of Mani Ratnams Guru in which he plays Gurukant Desai, a business tycoon with the golden touch.

 Ford is believed to have been not agreeable with the rising stars revised rates. But asked if this was behind the parting of ways, McCormack trotted out what Star Plus had said about not renewing the KBC contract.

 This was a mutually amicable call by both of us, he said.

 According to unconfirmed industry reports, Abhisheks annual endorsement fees stands at over Rs 4 crore, not much less than what is pocketed by his superstar father or even Shah Rukh Khan.

 Abhisheks brand manager and family friend Sunil Doshi wouldnt give anything away. I wouldnt like to comment on Abhisheks endorsement fees. Weve had a year-long relationship with Ford, but yes, this time the deal has fallen through because we could not agree on a host of points.

 Doshis company Alliance Media and Entertainment also handles Amitabhs endorsements.

 A top source at Ford said Abhishek was a commendable brand no doubt, but his stature has yet to touch dizzying heights despite his performance in Guru.

 The Ford brand is now well established in the market. At present, the company has decided to go without a brand ambassador, the source said.

 Abhishek landed the Ford Fiesta contract in 2005 after four of his films had a dream run at the box-office: Bluffmaster, Bunty aur Babli, Dus and Sarkar. The year after wasnt great, but he cemented his place under the sun with Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and Dhoom 2.

 In contrast, the Fiesta a mid-sized sedan was Fords best-selling model in 2006. The company sold 42,000 vehicles, an 80 per cent vault over the previous years sales.

 So hard bargaining was inevitable between the two of them. In the end, nobody was willing to blink, the Ford source said.

 Before the Fiesta, Abhishek had endorsed the Maruti Versa, along with his superstar father.

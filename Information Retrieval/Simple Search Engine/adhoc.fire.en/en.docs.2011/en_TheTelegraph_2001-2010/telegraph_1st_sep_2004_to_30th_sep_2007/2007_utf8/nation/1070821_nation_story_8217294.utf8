 Few toys left if India plays by Mattel rules

 New Delhi, Aug. 20: India may be rendered a land short of toys if the paint standards that international toy maker Mattel used to recall some products were applied to local, unbranded toys that dominate the domestic market, medical and environmental scientists have said. 

 Mattel recalled hundreds of thousands of toys worldwide earlier this month including 300 units of Sesame Street characters in India because they contained higher than permissible limits of lead, an element used in paint that children can ingest by chewing on the toys. 

 But scientists who have been studying paints and toys in India say locally-made, largely unbranded toys sold across India are also likely to contain potentially toxic levels of lead an element that can cause brain damage in children. 

 Toys with lead paint may impair childrens intellectual abilities, said Thuppil Venkatesh, professor of biochemistry at the St Johns Medical College, Bangalore, and head of the National Referral Centre for Lead Poisoning in India. 

 Through sheer ignorance, people give their children such toys, Venkatesh told The Telegraph. 

 A study by Toxics Link, a non-government organisation, of 88 non-branded toys picked up from New Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai last year showed that every toy contained varying concentrations of lead. The study revealed lead levels ranging from 2,100 parts per million to 0.65 parts per million.

 The human body does not need any lead. This element has no place in toys, Venkatesh said.

 The Bureau of Indian Standards has defined standards for limits of lead which, according to one senior toy industry executive, are comparable to the standards followed in the US and Europe. 

 The problem is they are voluntary, not mandatory, said Abhay Kumar, a scientist with Toxics Link who conducted the study. Without compulsory standards, local toy makers are free to do what they wish.

 Indias toy market is dominated by locally-made, unbranded products as well as imported products sold without adequate information, according to toy industry executives. An official estimated that some 75 per cent of toys sold in India are unbranded.

 The name or address of the manufacturer or importer dont even appear on some toys sold here, he said. Whos responsible for them?

 The lead-in-toys controversy has moved Indias apex agency that oversees child rights. We would like to evaluate Indian-made toys and examine whether there are mechanisms in place to prevent the entry of toys with lead into the Indian market, Sandhya Bajaj, a member of the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, said. 

 Kumar said lead is added to toys made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to make them durable. Substances in PVC can interact and lead to degradation of the toys. Lead compounds are among common stabilisers used to prevent this degradation, he said. 

 Some scientists believe the root of the problem is lead in paints manufactured in India. Studies suggest that 90 per cent of paints sold in hardware stores in India are lead-based paints, said Venkatesh.

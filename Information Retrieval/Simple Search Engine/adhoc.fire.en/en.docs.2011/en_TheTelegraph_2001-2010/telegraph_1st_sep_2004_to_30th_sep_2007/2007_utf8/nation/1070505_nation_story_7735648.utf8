 Gossip foils PC jaunt

 New Delhi, May 4: Whispers that the budget session would be truncated had Delhi in a frenzy of speculation since last evening, with the BJP spying a Congress game plan for Presidents rule in Uttar Pradesh.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi cleared the air with a denial today, but not before a scheduled foreign trip by finance minister P. Chidambaram had fallen casualty to the rumour.

 The most popular theory had tied the curtailment of the session, which was scheduled to continue till May 22, to the foreign trips Chidambaram and Das Munshi had planned over the weekend.

 The BJP, which seemed to believe the adjournment would come on May 8 three days before the Uttar Pradesh poll results had its own take.

 It hinted darkly that not having Parliament in session would make it easier for Delhi to impose central rule if the state, as expected, threw up a hung House.

 Nobody today could pinpoint how the rumour originated, but by the time the Lok Sabha was passing the finance bill last evening, it was on every lip. The Centre and the Opposition had agreed, the story went, that the session would be adjourned sine die.

 The logic seemed persuasive. Chidambaram was going to Kyoto on Saturday for the 40th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank, and Das Munshi to Kuala Lumpur for the Asian Football Confederation Congress. The Upper Houses business had therefore been re-arranged, it was suggested, so that the finance bill could be passed on Friday instead of Saturday and Chidambaram could travel with a light mind.

 The Rajya Sabha did pass the bill today but Das Munshi scotched the speculation, saying the session would run its course provided the BJP didnt disrupt proceedings.

 There was strong resentment from the Opposition. They asked why the finance minister had to leave in the midst of the budget session, Das Munshi said. By cancelling his trip, we have shown our governments commitment to Parliament.

 Political sources, however, suggested that it was a lobby within the Congress that had done the most to spread the news of Chidambarams trip and question its wisdom. They kept asking who would reply on the governments behalf if the Opposition insisted on a debate on the price rise.

 Das Munshis travel plans remain unclear. There is no official visit as of now. If theres a private visit, we dont know, an official said.

 The minister is believed to have been eager to go to the football congress but had to reconsider the trip after Chidambarams decision. The Prime Minister, too, was against any cabinet minister leaving the country while Parliament was in session.

 The presiding officers of both Houses also told the government that a sine die adjournment would tarnish Parliaments image.

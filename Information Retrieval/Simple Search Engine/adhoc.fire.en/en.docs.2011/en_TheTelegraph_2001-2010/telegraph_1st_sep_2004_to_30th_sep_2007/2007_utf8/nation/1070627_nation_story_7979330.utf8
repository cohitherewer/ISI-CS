 Maoists jam mineral zone

 OUR BUREAU

 June 26: A 48-hour economic blockade by Maoists choked mineral supply lines in large swathes of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand and hit train services.

 The Maoists are protesting the economic policies of the government, especially the setting up of special economic zones. The blockade began on the midnight of Monday-Tuesday.

 In Jharkhand, armed rebels blew up the engine of a goods train between Richuguta and Chetar stations in Latehar district. 

 A railway official said the rebels struck at 11 pm, an hour before the blockade was to begin. Twenty-two wagons derailed and overhead electric cables were destroyed. The driver and guard have been taken hostage. The loss to the railways is estimated at Rs 12 crore. This includes the cost of the engine and earnings likely to be lost. 

 Hours later, around 3 am, rebels carried out an explosion to uproot tracks between Barwadih and Mongra stations in Latehar. 

 A dozen passenger trains were cancelled in Jharkhand. Goods trains in the areas home to Coal Indias mines have been stopped since the engine was blasted.

 Ajay Kumar Shukla, the manager of the Dhanbad railway division, did not rule out suspension of services in the coal belt if the trouble continues.

 On the main Dhanbad-Gaya section of the Grand Chord, services were normal, barring an incident where the Jodhpur-Howrah Express was stopped early on Tuesday. The train was later allowed to proceed to its destination. In the Chakradharpur division (Howrah-Tata-Rourkela route) too, the services were normal, officials claimed.

 About 2,000 trucks were stranded in West Singhbhum because their drivers and owners refused to move for fear of attacks.

 Near Parasnath station, Maoists deflated the tyres of a truck after placing it on the railway tracks. At other places, they tried to dump coal from trucks on the tracks in a bid to stop trains. At Pakur, five trucks of a coal company were torched.

 Movement of minerals was crippled in Chhattisgarh, where the rebels stopped the supply of iron ore from Dantewada to Visakhapatnam port. Railway officials said the situation is unlikely to return to normal before June 30.

 Lie tests

 Noida killings accused Moninder Singh Pandher and Surendra were on Sunday subjected to a second round of lie-detection and brain-mapping tests. The narco-analysis is to begin on Monday, but Moninder, a diabetic, was taken to hospital in the evening.

 In Ludhiana, the Pandher Samaj asked members to sever ties with Moninder and his family. The Pandhers number about 50,000 in Punjab.

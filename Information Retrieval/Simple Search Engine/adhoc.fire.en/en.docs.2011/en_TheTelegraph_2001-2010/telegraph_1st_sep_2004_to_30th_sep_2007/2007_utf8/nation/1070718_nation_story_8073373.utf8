The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Mamata out of NDA till President poll

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mamata

 New Delhi, July 17: For Mamata Banerjee now, the NDA could well stand for No Dalliance with Ally.

 As the BJP-led combine tried to bring the third front over to its side in a last-ditch attempt, the Trinamul leader made it clear she was out of the alliance, at least for the July 19 presidential polls.

 Off Mamatas roster today was the NDA parliamentary party meeting this evening, a dinner hosted by Atal Bihari Vajpayee for Bhairon Singh Shekhawat tomorrow and another session on July 19 to choose a candidate for Vice-President.

 Mamata, who has sought permission to vote in the state legislature instead of Parliament on July 19, will stay put in Calcutta until the next President is elected. So will her MPs. And nobody has a clue to what she plans to do: vote for UPA nominee Pratibha Patil or abstain. This much is sure that she will not vote for Shekhawat, a BJP spokesperson said.

 BJP sources conceded they were also not sure of another ally, the Janata Dal (Secular), headed by H.D. Deve Gowda. The party isnt technically part of the NDA but runs a government with the BJP in Karnataka.

 The Shiv Sena has already said it will vote for Pratibha, despite being the BJPs oldest ally.

 BJP sources said their feeling was as the 2009 elections near, Mamata would make the right secular noises to distance her party from the BJP.

 As for the Dal (S), sources said Gowda has advised his son, chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, to open a line of communication with Sonia Gandhi by backing Pratibha.

 In Delhi, Shekhawats spokesperson Sushma Swaraj appealed to the United National Progressive Alliance or the third front to reconsider its decision not to vote.

 All the UNPA parties are products of anti-Congressism. But by abstaining they are helping the Congress, she said.

 Unlike the NDA, the UPA-Left was a picture of unity. The allies were dressed up for a solidarity dinner hosted by Sonia tonight at Hotel Ashoka to welcome the new addition to her parivar the BSP.

 EC ruling

 The Election Commission today said voting in the presidential polls was not compulsory and electors were free to vote for any candidate.

 Every elector had the freedom of making a choice to vote for any candidate or not to vote, the panel said following the NDAs demand that the third fronts decision to abstain be declared unconstitutional.

 The panel also said parties could not issue whips.

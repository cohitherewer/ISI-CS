 Left against defence pact

 New Delhi, July 14: The Left today said it is opposed to the India-US Logistics Support Agreement, reports our special correspondent. 

 We are against it, CPI national secretary D. Raja said. 

 It is also opposed to the five-nation naval exercises India is hosting in September.

 Apart from the US, Australia, Japan and Singapore will also participate.

 The CPM politburo, in a statement on the naval exercises, said Japan and Australia were close military allies of the US. India is now moving to join their ranks.

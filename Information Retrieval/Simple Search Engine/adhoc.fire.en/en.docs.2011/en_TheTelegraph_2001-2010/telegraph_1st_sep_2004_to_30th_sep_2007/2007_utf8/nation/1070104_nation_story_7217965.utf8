 New Delhi, Jan. 3: The Supreme Court today stayed proceedings against ADMK chief Jayalalithaa and her friend Sasikala before a trial court in Chennai in a case relating to non-filing of income-tax return during 1991 to 1994.

 The trial court had directed the former chief minister to be personally present before it on January 29 for framing of charges.

 Jayalalithaa and Sasikala were being prosecuted individually for not filing the IT returns in their capacity as partners in Sasi Enterprises.

 Poaching closes coaching school

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, June 2: The Super 30 coaching school, which helped many a poor student realise their IIT dream, was put under lock and key today. 

 The reason: rival centres allegedly hijacked three of its successful students and introduced them as their own to chief minister Nitish Kumar during a felicitation programme today.

 The Ramanujan School of Mathematics would train 30 teenagers every year for the IIT Joint Entrance Examination free of charge. The students most came from modest homes were also provided accommodation.

 The experiment, popularly known as Super 30, has featured in The New York Times and on Japanese TV.

 A brainchild of mathematician Anand Kumar and Abhayanand, the additional director-general of police and a physics teacher, the institute tasted success with 122 boys and girls clearing the exam in the last five years. This year, 28 have made it to the IITs.

 In an emotional outburst this evening, Kumar and Abhayanand announced the closure of the school. They said they felt frustrated because bogus coaching centres were buying off their students to advertise themselves.

 Several successful students today went to meet the chief minister. Three Super 30 boys were introduced to him as belonging to other coaching institutes, they said, but declined to either name the students or the poachers.

 We have failed in our mission, Kumar said. The IPS officer was equally distraught. Today, I have lost faith in humanity, Abhayanand said.

 Although the three boys have apologised, Kumar said the school would stay shut. The damage has been done. Super 30 is closed forever. We are poor and have no wherewithal to check miscreants poaching on our students.

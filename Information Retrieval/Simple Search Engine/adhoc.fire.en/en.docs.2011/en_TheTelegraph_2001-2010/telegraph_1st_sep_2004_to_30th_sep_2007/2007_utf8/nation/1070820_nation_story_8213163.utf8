 Mumbai, Aug. 19: Will Prakash Karats tough talk on the nuclear deal with the US send the sensex tumbling on Monday and nix the effects of Ben Bernankes soothing salve for badly roiled markets?

 Late on Friday, the US Federal Reserve raised a flutter by slashing its discount rate on short-term loans to US banks and financial institutions, which is widely expected to gee up global markets this week.

 The Lefts stand on the nuclear deal, which seems to have precipitated a crisis for the Manmohan Singh government, may see Indias bellwether index wobble but the market pundits dont think it will go into a tailspin.

 The markets have traditionally shown resilience towards such political shocks over a period of time, said Dhiraj Sachdev, vice-president, portfolio management services, at HSBC.

 The global factors will play a more crucial role. If they are positive, it will not have any impact on stocks here despite the political crisis. However, we will be keenly watching the events in Delhi.

 Market mavens believe that a solution will be found to break the tense standoff between the Left and the Congress, displaying a level of optimism that the political commentators in Delhi dont seem to share.

 V.K. Sharma, the head of research at Anagram Stock Broking, said the honeymoon between the UPA government and the Left might be over but divorce was an unlikely event.

 Sharma felt the sensex would recover this week after the recent pummelling but expressed the worry that the souring of relations between the Left and the UPA could jeopardise the governments moves to push through further reforms. It will recover this week, but it wont touch dizzying heights. 

 The bigger worry is that if the reforms are stymied, the sensex wont scale Point 16000. The index crossed 15000 in mid-July and has since stumbled amid growing fears of a global credit squeeze arising out of a crisis in US home mortgage markets. Last week, the BSE sensex crashed 726.73 points, or 4.89 per cent, to close at a 10-week low of 14141.52.

 Red mark blots Delhi report card on kids

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 27: India will cut a sorry figure at the Saarc next month when it presents its report card on what it has done to ensure a better future for its children.

 We are serious defaulters simply not investing enough in children who are 42 per cent of our population, says Razia Ismail of India Alliance for Child Rights.

 The latest National Family Health Survey shows that 57 per cent infants per 1,000 live births are still dying; 46 per cent below three years are underweight; and a whopping 79.2 per cent in the 6-35 months category are anaemic.

 Indian representatives will be embarrassed to read out the data that tells the story of the governments lack of will to look after children.

 Bangladesh does not fare much better. About 70 per cent of its children below five years are malnourished and 60 per cent are raised in houses without sanitary facilities.

 Pakistans children are in a far worse way than India and Bangladesh. Sri Lanka has always had a shining record in health and education.

 On paper, the Indian governments commitments and action plans for children look impressive. But there is a lack of implementation.

 In 1994, the Centre laid down a national children policy. It declared 1991-2000 as the decade of the girl child and adopted an action plan. Later, it adopted a national plan of action against sexual abuse and exploitation of children.

 But there was little follow-up action on the ground. Most important, there was a lack of investment in the Integrated Child Development Scheme, the largest scheme for childrens welfare not only in India but in the whole of Asia.

 The UN commission on child rights is calling specifically for more government investments for children, says Ismail.

 A crucial area that needs looking into is child trafficking. Successive governments in Delhi have not been able to tackle the growing volume.

 The UPA government is planning an exclusive anti-trafficking law to rein in the crime, which is now dealt with under the Indian Penal Code.

 Activists say announcing policies is not enough. The delivery system and the implementing agency are crucial to improving childrens lot.

 Despite petitions from academics and activists, this years budget has not made any substantial hike in allocation for childrens schemes.

 We are still hoping that the omission will be set right when the 11th five-year plan is announced, says an activist.

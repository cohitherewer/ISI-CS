 Teliwani (south Kashmir), Aug. 11: The fireball has been growing bigger since the first explosion shook this area early this morning, emptying villages around the army camp. 

 As the armys biggest ammunition depot in Kashmir went up in flames at Khundroo, thousands of villagers from several dozen villages fled to safety. Explosions rattled the area and huge plumes of smoke from the burning depot streaked the sky. 

 There were conflicting reports about casualties. But by evening, the authorities confirmed that two firefighters were dead and over 20 injured. 

 The army is tight-lipped about its casualties and the cause of the fire. 

 Villagers said the first explosion occurred at 8.55am, followed by two thunderous blasts which they mistook for an earthquake. Soon, they were confronted with a nightmarish scene as the depot was up in flames and artillery shells exploded. 

 Suraj Singh, a fireman lying on a hospital bed in Anantnag, said that when they entered the camp to douse the fire, there was a massive explosion. I do not know what happened later but I found myself in a hospital, he said. 

 His counterparts had a similar experience. All we could do was watch in horror with bang after bang virtually snuffing out breaths, said another fireman. 

 The army, however, tried to downplay the incident. 

 There is no question of anybody entering the camp, as it is cordoned off for several kilometres. No militant can fire any weapon from that range, said Brigadier K.S. Rana of 2 Sector Rashtriya Rifles. 

 There was a massive explosion in the morning, followed by a lull for around 20 minutes, Rana said. Then the ammunition nearby caught fire. We can assess the damage once the fire is controlled. 

 The local administration mobilised scores of ambulances and other facilities on a war footing for the treatment and evacuation of panic-stricken villagers. 

 All along the route to Khundroo, women could be seen walking with children towards Anantnag town. Many were carrying belongings. 

 Abdul Rasheed, of Khajiwara village, said he fled with his family after evacuation announcements were made from mosques. 

 Local MLA Peer Muhammad Hussian said the army has asked the civil administration to clear villages within 3km of the depot, especially the 13 that are in the danger zone. 

 The authorities have set up four relief camps at Larnoo, Mattan, Anantang and Chutrigul. 

 We are setting up a fifth camp at Seerhamdan as more and more people are fleeing, Hussian said. 

 The depot is situated in the foothills of Khundroo that provides a natural cover against sabotage. The camp is heavily guarded and passers-by cannot even smoke in the area. 

 The armys check points regularly carry out identity checks of all visitors.

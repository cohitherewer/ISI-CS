 New airline connects east

 New Delhi, March 20: Start-up airline MDLR will fly the Calcutta-Ranchi-Delhi-Chandigarh route six times a week, reports our correspondent.

 MDLR Airlines is being launched in April with a modest fleet of two 70-seater aircraft to connect small cities. 

 Koustav Dhar, president, commercial and airlines project, said: The smaller cities and non-metros have huge potential that is yet to be tapped. So, we will be connecting non-metro capital cities with the metros. Our target customer base includes small and medium-enterprise businessmen, government officials and, of course, tourists. 

 It will be a full-services airline with vegetarian cuisine.

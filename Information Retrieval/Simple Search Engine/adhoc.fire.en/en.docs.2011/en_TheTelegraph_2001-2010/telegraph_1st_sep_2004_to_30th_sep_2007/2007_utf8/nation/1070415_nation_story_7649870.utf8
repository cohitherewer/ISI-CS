 Loud buzz around outgoing envoys

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 (From top) Sharma, Sen, Sibal: Where to? 

 New Delhi, April 14: In the middle of the Uttar Pradesh poll headache, the government is being forced to take time off to decide the future of three key outgoing envoys to Britain, the US and Russia.

 With the terms of Kamalesh Sharma, Ronen Sen and Kanwal Sibal coming to an end in August, where they go from here is the subject of much speculation. Each of the three high-profile diplomats is believed to be very close to higher-ups in the corridors of power.

 Sibal is the brother of Kapil Sibal, minister for science and technology; Sen was the all-powerful joint secretary in the Prime Ministers Office during Rajiv Gandhis term, and Sharma is related to Suman Dubey, believed to be a friend of the Gandhi family.

 All three were either about to retire or had already retired when they were given these plum postings. That was shortly after the United Progressive Alliance government assumed charge in May 2004 although Sen had been assured the US posting even by the BJP government, in April.

 Sharma, after his retirement, had already done a stint in East Timor as the UN secretary-generals special envoy. He now apparently wants India to put his hat in the ring for the post of Commonwealth secretary-general, which falls vacant in December. As the outgoing official, Don McKinnon, is from New Zealand, its Asias turn this time.

 Unfortunately for Sharma, Malta foreign minister Michael Frendo just this week decided to contest for the job. And Delhi, burnt by Shashi Tharoors defeat in the battle for UN secretary-general last year, seems in no mood to join another race.

 The foreign office is agog with speculation that Sharma has also been offered the big job in America. That, of course, can happen only if Sen agrees to leave. Sen is in the thick of negotiating the 123 nuclear deal with the US, with the second round of talks taking place in about 10 days time.

 The buzz is that Sen could return to Delhi to a high-profile, advisorial post. Or, he could simply stay on in Washington. If Sen stays on, the big question is, what will Sharma do? 

 It is also being said that Kanwal Sibal, who will be completing three years in Moscow, is very keen on moving to London. 

 The problem is, when Shiv Shankar Menon superseded 16 people to become foreign secretary last October, it was understood that at least some of the overlooked diplomats would be posted to high places.

 For instance, when Nirupam Sen, Indias permanent representative to the UN in New York, asked for an extension, he got one. He will retire in August.

 It is also being speculated that Shiv Mukherjee, the ambassador to Nepal, would be sent to London once Sharmas term ends in August.

 If the buzz has got it right, that would make it two contenders already for London, Sibal and Mukherjee.

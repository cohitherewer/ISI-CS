 BJP chorus on low key

 Bhopal, June 2: Blame it on the heat or the tendency to report late for work, but the BJP regimes much touted practice of singing Vande Mataram in government offices is running out of steam.

 Yesterday, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan recited the national song with 300 employees less than 5 per cent of the staff strength in the secretariat.

 The gathering included a somewhat embarrassed chief secretary Rakesh Sahni and dozens of Chauhans security personnel.

 After the once-in-a-month singing of Vande Mataram was over, Chauhan witnessed something that annoyed him even more.

 As the clock ticked towards 11 am, two buses carrying government employees stopped at the Vallabh Bhavan gate. But the men and women who trooped out showed little urgency to reach their workplace. Already late, they ambled in, chatting and laughing.

 The chief minister has ordered a probe. He has asked the chief secretary and the general administration department to submit a report on why so many employees were reporting late for work.

 A July 2005 order had made singing Vande Mataram mandatory in all government offices and schools across Madhya Pradesh on the ground that it holds the constitutional status of national song. 

 The Opposition Congress and religious minorities had opposed the order, which subsequently forced the government to make singing Vande Mataram voluntary. But, on the first working day of every month, the state government made special arrangements for mass singing of the song.

 Initially, it began at 10 am but employees unions pushed it to 10.40, seeking a margin of 40 minutes for delay in arrival of pick-up vehicles. 

 Union leaders offered several reasons. R.C. Gupta, the Jan Kalyan Sangh general secretary, said: Most employees look forward to singing Vande Mataram, but with the temperature touching 44 Celsius, there should be concessions.

 Sources in the state secretariat, however, said the truth was different. According to them, most employees treat the first day of the month as an informal half-day on account of Vande Mataram.

 Since a tent has to be put up and employees come from different departments and offices, it appears like a social event with many opting for tea and catching up with gossip, said an official.

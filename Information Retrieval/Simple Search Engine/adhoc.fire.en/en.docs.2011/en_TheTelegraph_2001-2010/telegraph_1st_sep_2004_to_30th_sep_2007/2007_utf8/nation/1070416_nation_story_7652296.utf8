 Techie body arrives

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, April 15: When Shailesh Raval saw the coffin at the airport this evening, he was too shocked to cry, too shaken to walk. 

 Fortunately, he wasnt alone. Relatives surrounded the numbed father as he received the body of his son, Devang. 

 The 25-year-old computer engineer was killed when protests by environmentalists in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, turned violent last Thursday, leading to attacks on businesses run by people of Indian origin there. The incident revived memories of the bloody Idi Amin years.

 Among those offering support at the airport were leader of Opposition Arjun Modhwadia and mayor Amit Shah. 

 Devang, the familys only earning member, had gone to Uganda two years ago. He was to return next month for his engagement. His father, a retired textile worker, ekes out a living presiding over religious ceremonies as a priest.

 Mayur Raval, Devangs cousin, said there was no help from the Indian government and authorities in Uganda. The Gujaratis there pooled in money to fly his body home.

 Devangs roommate in Kampala, Shehal Patel, had called up his mother after his death. Unlike many Indians who have been there for generations, Devang had gone to Uganda on a work permit in search of better career prospects. 

 He was working as a marketing executive with a private firm, said Nirav, Devangs younger brother. The firm was set up by Nanjibhai Kalidas Mehta, the grandfather of Jay Mehta, who is married to actress Juhi Chawla. The Mehtas, from Porbandar, own Saurashtra Cements and Gujarat Sidhee Cement at Veraval.

 The group wants to acquire 7,000 hectares of virgin rainforest near Kampala for sugarcane cultivation but the plan sparked protests from locals.

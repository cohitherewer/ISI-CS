 Kakodkar

 Bangalore, Aug. 17: Atomic Energy Commission chairman Anil Kakodkar today said India would continue to have the sovereign right to carry out a nuclear test and there was no ban on it in the text of the nuclear deal with the US, reports our special correspondent.

 Except for the voluntary unilateral moratorium India has imposed upon itself, Kakodkar did not see any problem in conducting a nuclear test after the deal becomes operational.

 Referring to nuclear military activity around which a storm is brewing, he said: The agreement... does not say anything about testing. There are absolutely no prohibitions on testing.

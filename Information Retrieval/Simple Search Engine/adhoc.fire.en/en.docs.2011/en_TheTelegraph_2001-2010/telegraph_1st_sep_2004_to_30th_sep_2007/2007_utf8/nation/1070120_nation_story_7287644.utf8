 Jaitley buzz on Sidhu turf

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 Jaitley

 New Delhi, Jan. 19: As cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu waits for the Supreme Court to decide whether he can contest elections, the BJP has started toying with the idea of fielding general secretary Arun Jaitley from the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat.

 Jaitley parried a direct question today about whether the BJP would pit him from the prestigious seat where the bypoll was announced after Sidhu resigned in the wake of his conviction in an attempt-to-murder case. I do not comment on hypothetical situations, Jaitley said.

 The Congress is closely watching the developments in the BJP. If the BJP decides to field Jaitley, the Congress would be forced to pit a heavyweight such as Punjab finance minister Surinder Singla. 

 Alternatively, the names of former actor Rajesh Khanna and the mayor of Amritsar, Sunil Datti, are doing the rounds in the party circles.

 The BJP is officially waiting for the verdict on Sidhus plea. The partys central election committee, that held two rounds of meetings today to finalise the names of candidates for eight Assembly seats in Punjab and 70 in Uttarakhand, did not take any decision on the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat. The bypoll will be held along with the Assembly polls.

 The order on Sidhus application is expected on January 22. But if the apex court postpones it, the BJP would have to take a decision because the last date for filing nominations from Amritsar is January 25. 

 Jaitleys name came up when his supporters denied the possibility of yet another strong contestant Sidhus wife who is also called Navjot. 

 The story that emerged about Sidhus wife was that the cricketer has told the BJP that she is a private and family-oriented person who is not the ideal choice to contest an election.

 Jaitley refused to get involved in the speculations. Asked whether he would agree if the party formally asks him to contest from Amritsar, he said: No one has asked me. Although he laughed off the suggestion, Jaitley significantly did not say that he would not contest if asked.

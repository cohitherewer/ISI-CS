 Calcutta, March 17: As he stepped out today to take his last Madhyamik exam, Ajit Singh told his friends he would finally be able to play cricket as long as he wanted in the evening.

 Some six hours later, when he returned to his Vivekananda Road home, his friends were dumbstruck.

 A speeding lorry had killed the 16-year-old while he was crossing Central Avenue on his way to school to take the physical education exam.

 The lorry, loaded with LPG cylinders, was speeding down from Vivekananda Road and was taking a left turn towards Central Avenue. The traffic constable waved at the driver asking him to stop, but he raced on and knocked down the boy, a senior officer of Jorabagan traffic guard said.

 Bleeding from the nose, Ajit was rushed to Medical College and Hospital where he died of head injuries.

 At the hospital, police fished out Ajits admit card from his bag and intimated his father, Sashi Bhusan Singh.

 You never had to ask Ajit to sit down to study. After returning from school, he would go for a game of cricket, return home and have food and then settle down to his studies, Sashi Bhusan said, struggling to hold back tears.

 The youngest in the family after sister Rakhi and brother Rohit, Ajit had assured all he would get a first division in Madhyamik. He had even got his parents to agree to what he wanted to study in Plus Two.

 When the officer came to our house, we couldnt believe it. I thought he had an accident but was alive. But to see him dead was beyond belief, Rohit said.

 Ajit wasnt the only student to fall to killer wheels. A 13-year-old Liluah schoolgirl, too, died after being hit by a private bus in Howrah.

 A student of Class VIII, Nisha Naskar had been standing on a pavement on Benaras Road around 10 am when the Howrah-Jagadishpur bus rammed into her, killing her on the spot.

 Two more students, sisters going to take their Class IX annual exams, met a gory end at Suri, 220 km from Calcutta.

 Salma Khatun, 18, and Yasmin, 17, were riding pillion on their fathers motorbike when a bus crashed into them. All three got entangled in its wheels and died on the spot.

 Six persons were killed in Purulia town, about 240 km from Calcutta, when the bus they were travelling in fell into a ditch while trying to give way to a police jeep.

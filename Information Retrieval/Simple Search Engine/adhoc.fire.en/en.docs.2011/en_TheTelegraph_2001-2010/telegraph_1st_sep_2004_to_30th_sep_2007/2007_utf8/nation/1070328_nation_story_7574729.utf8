 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Big fuss over holy wheels

 The Thyagaraja Swami shrine in Tiruvarur has the states tallest temple-chariot. But maintaining it is a huge burden for the government, technologically and financially.

 It also requires a lot of strength thousands of devotees who throng the temple during festivals lend more than a hand to get the giant wooden chariot to budge.

 But this year, a controversy erupted over the day on which the chariot festival should be celebrated. Temple authorities said it would be observed on March 23 the day M. Karunanidhi presented his budget. Incidentally, the chief minister is from Tiruvarur.

 Sniffing politics, the BJP and its other Hindutva outfits declared they would make a small replica of the chariot, place a portrait of Thyagaraja Swami (Lord Shiva) on it and pull the juggernaut on March 29.

 he lesson: hit the road twice, get greater mileage. Like politicians in the state, God must hit the streets often even if its not him making a point.

 Shop--play mall scores

 Mumbai didnt just appear to be getting enough of cricket until it all fell apart on Friday night, that is.

 Hypercity, a Malad mall popular with suburban bargain-hunters, had laid out a World Cup arena, complete with 20-foot stumps, giant bats and balls. And quite unusually, it even boasted of a graffiti wall. Then, there was a Wall of Fame, showing Team Indias best World Cup moments and some interesting trivia. Somebody didnt know what was coming.

 The store also had cricketers corners, meant for fun games. In the one named after Sachin, for instance, participants had to stand in a circle and balance a ball on a bat while stroking it without stepping out of the circle or dropping the ball. They had to do this at least 50 times.

 If only our willow warriors had managed to make similar contact last week.

 Green growl on bus route

 The green brigade is on the offensive again, this time training its guns on a planned high-speed bus corridor. The campaign has now taken the shape of a petition that seeks to prevent the felling of trees along the route.

 NGOs like the World Wildlife Fund, Kalpvriksha and the Toxics Link say the corridor has been conceived without inviting public feedback on its possible consequences. 

 The petition, to be submitted to chief minister Delhi Sheila Dikshit, lists 10 points aimed at preventing an assault on the green cover. 

 The campaigners have also drawn attention to the 30,000 trees knocked down to make way for the Metro, flyovers, subways and other projects. Former Prime Minister V.P. Singh and author Khushwant Singh are among those to have put their signatures.

 Plane relief

 An hours wait for permission to land isnt uncommon for fliers to the countrys busiest airport. But the air is now thick with speculation about some relief.

 The Airports Authority of India, which runs the countrys air hubs, has indicated that it was considering a plan that would allow smaller planes, choppers, a handful of cargo aircraft and some private jets to use the Juhu airport. That air strip isnt far from the highly overburdened Chhatrapati Shivaji Airport.

 An international consultant has suggested that Juhu can handle general aviation activities, involving small aircraft. But a final decision will be taken only after the results of a technical study are known.

 Bangalore: If you are flying into the Garden City before this weekend, you might consider spicing up your trip with a stopover at The Park for a scrumptious spread of Thai specialities. A food festival is on there till March 30. For reservations, call 25594666

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Britains Guru of Gossip, with Calcutta connection

 AMIT ROY 

 Nigel Dempster

 London, July 14: Nigel Dempster, who has died in London, aged 65, came to be considered the Guru of Gossip when he wrote a diary column for the Daily Mail newspaper from 1973 until poor health forced him to retire in 2003. 

 Having long written about celebrities, he became a celebrity himself, even a famous brand name which sold his paper. 

 A broad smile lit up his face when once told that an Indian newspaper tycoon had called him the most important journalist in Britain. 

 Oh, really? How very kind, responded Dempster, whose demeanour made it clear he thought the remark most perceptive. 

 Many assumed that Dempster, who had tried to pass himself off as an Old Etonian in his early days in journalism, was himself a member of the English aristocracy since this was where he trawled for material for his column. A colleague had jokingly dubbed him the greatest living Englishman but the epithet stuck. 

 In fact, Nigel Richard Patton Dempster was Australian. He neither hid nor advertised the fact, nor that his birthplace was Calcutta, where he was born the son of an Australian mining engineer on November 1, 1941. 

 When it was once suggested to him that he should return to the city of his birth to preside over a seminar on gossip and celebrity journalism, a genre he had done so much to create, he was genuinely taken by the notion. But the venture ultimately foundered as he began to suffer from PSP (progressive supranuclear palsy a form of Parkinsons disease). 

 To some extent, Dempster was the creation of the late David English, the powerful editor of the Daily Mail. 

 After the Daily Mail went tabloid following its merger with the Daily Sketch, English recruited Dempster from the Daily Express in 1971 and gave him his own column two years later. 

 The column, which appeared five days a week, chronicled mostly the lapses of politicians, aristocrats and others in public life and was required reading in the 1970s and early 1980s. 

 After the birth of the Daily Mails sister paper, the Mail on Sunday, the column was published six days a week from 1986 under Dempsters picture byline, even though it was the work of a team of journalists and even appeared in his absence. 

 What made him effective was an impressive memory for biographical detail. It is said that when he walked into a cocktail party, he knew not only who was married to whom but also who had previously been married to whom. Of course, part of his job was to inform his devoted following of readers who was sleeping with whom. 

 He had excellent contacts, among them the late Princess Margaret, the Queens sister about whom he wrote a book. Another contact whom he also presumably paid generously for tips was Princess Dianas brother, Charles, the 9th Earl Spencer. 

 After a reporter had once written a story for the news pages, giving details of how Charles had been part of a rowdy gang that had trashed a restaurant, a horrified Dempster marched into the editors office and protested that one of his best sources was about to be compromised. The story was pulled. 

 He landed one of his best scoops in December 1975, when he predicted that the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, was about to resign. Wilson threatened to sue but failed to do so when he resigned three months later. 

 In 1973, he said Lady Annabel Birley, wife of Mark Birley, owner of Annabels nightclub, was pregnant by her lover, James Goldsmith. Dempster was, of course, not to know at that stage that the baby, Jemima Goldsmith her parents later married would 21 years later choose one Imran Khan, Lothario of Pakistan, to be her husband.

 Dempster was not particularly put off by the distress he inevitably caused.

 The actress Vivien Merchant discovered from Dempsters column that her playwright husband, Harold Pinter, was sleeping with novelist Antonia Fraser and eventually took her own life. 

 It is just as well for Indian politicians that India has not yet produced an equivalent of Nigel Dempster. He took the view that far-reaching decisions by politicians could often be traced to events in their personal lives. 

 No one really cares what politicians say theyre all liars, cheats and fools, was his opinion. To know what theyre really like and to understand what motivates them, voters have to know whats going on in their lives. My job is to provide insights into the workings of those who are above us in terms of power and privilege, position and money. 

 He justified his style of intrusive journalism: If the trade of the gossip columnist is trivial, then all of life is trivial. 

 Rather in the manner of Bollywood villains who take shoes thrown at the screen to be a tribute to their acting skills, Dempster felt he was really doing his job when legal threats flowed in and they did. Luckily, he had the total support of his editor when he reflected that writs are the Oscars of my profession. 

 He was delighted when a particularly poisonous snake at London Zoo was named Nigel in his honour.

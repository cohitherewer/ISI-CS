 New Delhi, May 19: Worried by the number of soldier suicides, the defence establishment has asked the army to post more psychiatric counsellors in zones of heavy deployment and set up mechanisms with civilian authorities to address grievances of soldiers families.

 The instructions have been issued not only by defence minister A.K. Antony but also Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Singh today expressed his concern without specifically referring to soldier suicides and incidents of fragging, soldiers killing soldiers or officers.

 Singh used the forum of the Kendriya Sainik Board the apex body for the welfare of veterans to extend support to Antonys efforts to evolve mechanisms with state governments to relieve family pressures on soldiers.

 As the soldiers are posted far from home, it is difficult for them to attend to the needs of their families, and to deal with property-related matters and other personal issues, the Prime Minister said at the 27th annual general meeting of the board. To assist them, we need a mechanism by which at the district level, the collector, and at the state level, a nominated senior officer, can every quarter review the status of grievance redress.

 The meeting was attended by representatives of most state governments, besides senior military officers.

 Since 2004, over 400 soldiers have committed suicide. Of these, 327 were from the army, 64 from the air force, and 13 from the navy and the Coast Guard. Antony said he had written to chief ministers to seek quick administrative response to domestic problems of soldiers.

 JJ heads to China

 General J.J. Singh leaves for China on a eight-day visit on Sunday. The army chief will lead a delegation of officers from all three services. 

 On the top of his agenda is a proposal for joint military exercises. So long, there has only been observer status, meaning that representatives of either military were invited only to observe occasional drills.

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Shop amp; drop bait to win them over

 Pooja Gupta believes in pampering her customers, and she is willing to go the extra mile literally!

 As her apparel chain Bizarre makes a foray into the capitals ethnic wear market with a showroom in Gurgaon, Gupta is thinking of introducing pick-up and drop facilities for select customers. 

 She says her clothes are designer and niche, and her customers must be made to feel special. 

 We will pamper them in every way we can, she says, though she is keeping her other pampering plans close to her chest. 

 The new showroom to be called Khayal will focus on clothing for special occasions such as weddings or parties, Gupta says. 

 Bollywood pep pill for gang

 This is a classic case of life imitating art.

 A gang of dacoits in Thane district watch films for inspiration before they launch their looting spree. Their favourites are the Sunny Deol-starrers and Mithun Chakrabortys masala flicks. 

 Police sources said the dacoits, all of whom belong to a particular tribe, watch these films for their violent content to pep them up before they set out on their job. 

 But most of them dont have access to TV, so they watch the movies at video parlours. 

 hane (rural) police have now decided to retaliate Bollywood-style bullet for a bullet. Additional inspector-general (Konkan region) Satya Pal Singh, under whose jurisdiction these dacoities have taken place, said: I have formed three special squads to track down the dacoits. The law permits firing in self-defence. 

 The rural police have also sought help from their counterparts in Mumbai and Thane (city).

 Rahu kaal remedy

 Dr Ahmed Ali had a peculiar problem. 

 The surgeon just couldnt remember when Rahu kaal fell, the inauspicious day when not many of his patients would want to go under the scalpel. 

 Thus was born Alis one-liner Mother Saw Father Wearing The Turban on Sunday.

 Except on, the first letter of each word stands for the day when Rahu kaal falls. On the first day Monday it is between 7.30 and 9 am. Then you need to only add 90 minutes subsequently for the other days as indicated by the words in the mnemonic device sentence to know when Rahu kaal falls on the other days of the week, the doctor chuckled.

 So, on Saturday the Rahul kaal is from 9 to 10.30 am, Friday, 10.30 am to noon, Wednesday, noon to 1,30 pm, and so on. 

 The feat has earned the doctor a new name from his patients Ali Iyer. The Brahmin surname, they think, goes well with this brilliant brainwave! 

 Speed governors

 Karnataka has slammed the brakes on speeding commercial vehicles. 

 With taxis, trucks, maxi-cabs and school buses often seen tearing through roads, the government has decided to make speed governors mandatory from July 1.

 These gadgets, priced at Rs 15,000, will restrict the maximum speed to 60 kmph. The state transport department has proposed a fine of Rs 10,000 if speed governors are not installed.

 Motor vehicle associations are, predictably, crying foul. They believe the rule should be applicable all over India and not just in one state. Taxi drivers say the slow pace would irk tourists. 

 Delhi: Eat drink and be merry. On May 20, the NYC at Radisson Hotel is laying a buffet that will boast of the finest liquor from Bacardi and Smirnoff to a range of wines and beers. The food is as lip-smacking. 

 Priced at Rs 600 a person, the buffet is on from 12.30 pm to 3 pm, and then from 7 pm to midnight.

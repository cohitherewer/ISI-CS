 Suspensions spark JNU fast

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 24: JNU students began a relay hunger strike last night after 10 students were punished with suspension or fines for a gherao of the registrars car during an agitation in February.

 The students today focused on the just cause behind their February agitation underpayment of campus labourers and accused the authorities of stifling their democratic right to protest.

 The university, however, insisted the punishment was only for misbehaving with registrar Avais Ahmed and holding him prisoner in his car for six hours on February 19.

 The two issues shouldnt be mixed. There is no bar on raising issues like corruption but there is no room for violence and misbehaviour on the campus, an official said.

 On Friday, the authorities rusticated seven students for one term and fined three others Rs 2,000 each. 

 The authorities said they were ready for a mid-term review if there was a request from the students. Till today, none of the students had been told to vacate their hostels.

 Last night, the students union led a protest march across the campus and gave the call for the hunger strike, demanding the university withdraw the punishment.

 By taking severe action against student activists fighting for minimum wages for contract labourers, the administration has shown scant regard for the democratic opinion of the student community, union president Dhananjay Tripathi said.

 He is among the three students fined, the others being general secretary Sandeep Singh and joint secretary Jyotsna Singh.

 The students had begun the February agitation after finding out that daily wagers hired for construction on the campus were being paid Rs 80 instead of the minimum wage of Rs 158. 

 The registrar was held hostage after he ordered the removal of posters and pamphlets.

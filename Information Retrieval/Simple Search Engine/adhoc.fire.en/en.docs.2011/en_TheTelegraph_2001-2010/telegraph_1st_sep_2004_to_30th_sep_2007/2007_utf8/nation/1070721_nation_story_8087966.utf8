 Bid to clip AIIMS chief wings

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Venugopal

 New Delhi, July 20: The Centre plans to amend the law governing the All India Institute of Medical Sciences to curb the powers of the institutes director and immediately terminate the tenure of incumbent P. Venugopal.

 The decision comes after months of debate within the government on whether to remove Venugopal a celebrated cardiac surgeon, but also a man accused of fomenting caste discrimination at AIIMS. 

 We all stand behind the health minister, information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi told reporters today after a meeting of the Union cabinet. 

 Health minister Anbumani Ramadoss, who is also the president of the institute, will now be in a position to dismiss the director unilaterally, if the AIIMS governing body votes that there are serious irregularities in its functioning, sources said. 

 Violation of the governing bodys decisions is part of serious irregularities.

 The AIIMS Act of 1956 clearly mentions that the directors term ends at the age of 65 or after five years, whichever is earlier. Venugopal was appointed to the post in 2004 by the NDA government when he was 62. He turned 65 on July 6, but continues to remain director. 

 The amendment will prevent a repeat of this. 

 An inquiry committee, set up at the Prime Ministers intervention following allegations of reserved category students facing ghettoisation, found Venugopal guilty of allowing caste discrimination to fester on the campus.

 There were, however, differences within the government on whether Venugopal should be removed. While Ramadoss wanted to sack him, senior PMO officials are learnt to have backed the embattled surgeon. 

 The move to amend the law has triggered fresh accusations that the government is trying to erode the autonomy of institutes like AIIMS. 

 This move is condemnable. The Centre cannot, on the one hand, talk of increasing the autonomy of institutes like AIIMS and, on the other hand, hold the power to change the director according to its whims, said Kumar Harsh, the president of the AIIMS Residents Welfare Association. 

 Reserved category students at AIIMS today renewed their demand that the Centre immediately dismiss Venugopal. Thirteen reserved category doctors who had applied for the posts of senior residents continued their relay hunger strike, seeking a meeting with the director.

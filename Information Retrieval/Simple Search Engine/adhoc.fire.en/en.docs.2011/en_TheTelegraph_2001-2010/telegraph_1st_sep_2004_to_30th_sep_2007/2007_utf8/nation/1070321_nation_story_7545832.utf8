 Jogi gets a breather, 2 days after arrest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Raipur, March 20: Ajit Jogi got a temporary reprieve today when a sessions court granted him bail, two days after his arrest in connection with the murder of Nationalist Congress Party leader Ram Avtar Jaggi.

 The former Chhattisgarh chief minister (in picture) was granted bail on a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh and two sureties of Rs 50,000 each. Additional district and sessions judge B.L. Tidke said there was no possibility of the accused influencing witnesses as their statements had been recorded in a trial court. 

 Soon after his arrest on Sunday night, Jogi was admitted to Raipurs Escorts Hospital after he complained of chest pain.

 Today, opposing his bail, government counsel Santosh Pandey insisted that Jogi should not be allowed to visit Rajnandgaon, where he was campaigning for a by-election. At this Jogis lawyer Vivek Tankha said this point only strengthened his argument that the arrest was a plot to keep Jogi away from campaigning.

 The CBI, which is probing the four-year-old murder, has not opposed the bail.

 The sessions court observed that a local court had ordered Jogis arrest on a private complaint filed by the slain leaders son, Satish. It said since another accused in the case, Jogis son Amit, had been granted bail, Jogi, too, could be given a breather.

 Jogi was arrested on Sunday night when additional chief judicial magistrate Satyabhama Ajay Dubey issued a non-bailable warrant against him while he was campaigning for the bypoll.

 Jogi moved a bail application before a first-class judicial magistrate yesterday, but the plea was rejected on the grounds of jurisdiction. Jogis lawyers then moved the sessions court.

 Jaggi was killed by unidentified persons on June 4, 2003, six months before Assembly polls in Chhattisgarh. His son Satish and the BJP had alleged the involvement of Jogi, who was then chief minister. 

 Initially, the police arrested five persons from Uttar Pradesh, claiming they shot Jaggi while attempting to rob him. 

 However, when the BJP came to power, the Raman Singh-led government handed over the case to the CBI.

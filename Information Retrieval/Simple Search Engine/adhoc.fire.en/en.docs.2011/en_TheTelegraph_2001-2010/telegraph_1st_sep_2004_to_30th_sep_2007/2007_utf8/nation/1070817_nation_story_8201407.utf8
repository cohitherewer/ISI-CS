The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 BJP raises pitch, goes after Singh

 SANJAY K. JHA 

 Singh: Facing the heat

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: The BJP today declared that the Indo-US deal could not be implemented and it would remain a dead letter, raising its pitch to match the Lefts tone.

 The strident posture, despite the general impression that many NDA stalwarts want the deal to go ahead, suggests that there is more to the BJPs opposition than political tokenism. 

 Sensing the gravity of the problem between the Left and the government, the BJP has significantly upgraded its level of attack. While its members led the Opposition in stalling both the Houses, it went to the extent of moving a privilege motion against Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 The BJP feels that the Prime Minister misled Parliament and cites the US announcement that any future nuclear test will terminate the deal.

 This has always been the American position but the BJP believes that there is a case for privilege against the Prime Minister for telling the House that India retains the right to test.

 A privilege motion against a Prime Minister has never been accepted, but the move shows how desperate the BJP is to embarrass Manmohan Singh.

 The BJP sounded far more aggressive today probably because of the leaderships assessment that the controversy needed to be exploited to the hilt.

 Yashwant Sinha, considered a hardliner, said: The kind of deal that this government has entered into is absolutely unimplementable. This will remain a dead letter. 

 Sinha said the deal would become the biggest cause for spoiling Indo-American relations because, he said ...the main purpose of the United States is to cap, to roll back and finally eliminate Indias strategic nuclear programme. 

 He said American leaders were right in saying that India cannot conduct further tests. He expressed surprise at the brazen manner in which the government was misleading the nation. 

 Sinha took exception to the Indian Prime Minister being contradicted by a US state department flunky which does not do any credit to the country or the high office. The BJP leader was referring to the statement of state department spokesperson Sean McCormack that the deal would be terminated if India tests again.

 The BJPs bitterness was reflected in its decision to club the US statement on the nuclear deal with Ottavio Quattrocchis departure from Argentina and describe them as two shameful incidents on the 60th Independence Day.

 Focus on Ajit, not Mulayam

 New Delhi, Feb. 24: Amid the razzle-dazzle of Mulayam Singh Yadav planning a trust vote and Mayavati trying to take the fizz out of the Uttar Pradesh chief ministers move by getting her party MLAs to resign, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has quietly identified Ajit Singh and not the Samajwadi Party chief as its main rival in the western parts of the state.

 According to BSP sources, the partys poll strategy is based on the consideration that it can maximise its gains only by sharpening the divide between the Jatav or Dalit and Jat voters in western Uttar Pradesh.

 While Ajits Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) claims to represent Jat voters, Mayavati has the backing of the Jatavs.

 There are nearly 130 Assembly seats in western Uttar Pradesh. In a majority of these constituencies, the Jats and Jatavs are not only evenly balanced but are also at loggerheads. If this divide is stressed upon, the party can maximise its gains in the region, a senior BSP leader said.

 What has further led to the BSPs plan of focusing on Ajit more than on Mulayam in these constituencies is Mayavatis growing confidence of taking along in the Assembly polls a considerable section of voters belonging to the Brahmin and Baniya castes as well as a section of the Muslim community, sources pointed out. 

 For quite some time, Mayavati has been organising mahasammelans of Brahmins and Baniyas apart from promising them tickets for the Assembly polls. As far as the Muslim voters are concerned, the BSP is confident it would also gain from the communitys tactical anti-BJP voting pattern, especially in the western parts of the state. 

 In most of the constituencies, Muslim, Brahmin and Baniya voters hold the key. These electorates provide the crucial extra votes that decide the fate of candidates having the backing of the Jats or the Jatavs, the leader said.

 A focus on anti-incumbency against Mulayam would dilute the divide and make the fight multi-cornered, which might not work in favour of the BSP, he added.

 Whatever the RLD may claim, the fact is that it has the winnable vote base in less than 20 seats. In the rest, the Jat voters are always up for grabs by other parties, which often make the elections multi-cornered. This is not in the interest of the BSP, the BSP leader said.

 Mayavatis strategy to shift the attack from her arch-rival Mulayam to a local satrap in western Uttar Pradesh is likely to give rise to new equations in these constituencies.

 A stress on the divide between Jats and Jatavs may not only re-ignite the line of fire between the two which has remained dormant for quite sometime a sharp polarisation of the two castes may also adversely affect the prospects of the Samajwadi Party, Congress and the BJP in western Uttar Pradesh.

 Aussie cop in India

 Bangalore, July 10 (PTI): An Australian police officer is in India as part of investigations into Mohammed Haneefs suspected role in the failed UK bombings.

 The 27-year-old Indian doctor, whose detention in Brisbane has been extended till Wednesday, might appeal if Australian police seek to keep him in custody any longer, his lawyer said today. The police have indicated they might ask for another extension.

 In New Delhi, the Australian high commission confirmed that an officer was in the country. The AFP (Australian Federal Police) agent is here as part of investigations, a mission official said, refusing to identify him or his rank.

 The officer has met senior Indian intelligence officials and is coordinating with Karnataka police, sources said. 

 Haneefs lawyer and his family in Bangalore has complained that the police are not revealing the charges against him.

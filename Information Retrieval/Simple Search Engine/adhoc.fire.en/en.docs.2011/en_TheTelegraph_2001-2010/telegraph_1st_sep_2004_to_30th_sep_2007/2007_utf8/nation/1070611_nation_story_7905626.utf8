 Village reaches out, the digital way

 New Delhi, June 10: A hundred kilometres east of Indias Silicon Valley city of Bangalore, in the middle of fields of cabbage, beans, custard apples and guavas, a silent digital revolution is under way.

 With the touch of a finger, residents of the drought-prone village of Budikote will soon be able to bridge barriers of language and literacy to share their stories and experiences with other villagers in India and across the globe.

 Armed with technology devised by a team of five UK universities, the villagers among the first in the country to set up a community radio station in 2000 may also finally cease to suffer at the hands of corrupt middlemen.

 When Budikote pioneered the community radio station movement, other villages across the country followed. Hopefully, the same will happen again, said Maxine Frank, a community worker who has been with the villagers for several years.

 Munraj, an auto-rickshaw driver, discovered the excitement of storytelling when a Karnataka minister visited the village. Camera in hand, he recorded the trip, and is going to add it to the fast burgeoning digital library in the village community centre that can be accessed via a touchscreen.

 Some others in the village with a population of around 3,000 like to add background music to their stories.

 The jump across the digital divide that separates rural India from the urban is not complete though, said Frank.

 Currently, while people can create their stories and store them, the mode of transmitting them elsewhere is only through the Internet, which is not yet readily available to most Indians. So, most people wont be able to see our stories.

 Internet connectivity in villages like Budikote is also very poor, said Ashish Sen, who runs Voices, an NGO working in Budikote.

 What is needed is the technology to use mobile phones to transmit and receive stories from the digital library, Sen said, a statement borne out by telecom ministry officials who said the phone had reached far deeper in rural India than the Internet.

 This July, the UK team from the universities of London, Surrey, Swansea (in Wales), Loughborough and Nottingham Trent will be bringing Nokia phones programmed for just that.

 Villagers would then be able to use the phones, which would be kept at the community centre, to create their stories, said professor Matt Jones at Swansea University.

 The software on the phones allows them to add music, colour, and other multimedia components to their stories, and then upload them with the help of Bluetooth technology on to the digital library.

 Most residents of the village are illiterate, and therefore could only communicate by radio with fellow Kannada speaking villagers, said Frank. Since this technology uses only audio-visuals, the stories told through this medium will be able to break all language and literacy barriers.

 A villager can then consult his counterparts, in say, a village in another state, to find out the price of fruits or vegetables there. It could end the racketeering of middlemen, said an excited Sen.

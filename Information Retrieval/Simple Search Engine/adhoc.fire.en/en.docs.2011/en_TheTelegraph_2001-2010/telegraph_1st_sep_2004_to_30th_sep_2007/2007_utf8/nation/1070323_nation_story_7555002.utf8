 Fresh Ayodhya breather for Advani

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Advani

 New Delhi, March 22: The Babri Masjid demolition case against L.K. Advani and seven other leaders will go on separately in a Rae Bareli court without conspiracy charges.

 Efforts to seek transfer of the case to Lucknow, where other cases in connection with the 1992 demolition were being heard, came to a naught with the Supreme Court today refusing to review an earlier verdict it had given.

 The decision came on a petition that Aslam Bhure, who has been intervening in matters concerning the disputed structure, had filed seeking review of the courts November 2002 judgment. In that verdict, the apex court had upheld an Allahabad High Court order, which had quashed a notification transferring the case to the special court in Lucknow.

 Bhure had been seeking trial in the Lucknow court that had framed charges against the eight before the high court held that the notification was invalid.

 Soon after the demolition at Ayodhya, the local police had registered two FIRs one against unknown kar sevaks and the other against Advani, Ashok Singhal, Giriraj Kishore, Murli Manohar Joshi, Vishnu Hari Dalmia, Vinay Katiyar, Uma Bharti and Sadhvi Ritambhara. 

 The cases, which were being heard at Rae Bareli, were transferred to Lucknow but somehow the case relating to the eight politicians was not mentioned in the list. The state government, thereafter, issued another notification for transfer of the omitted case but the notification was held invalid.

 After separation of the case, the CBI had in 2003 the BJP-led NDA was in power then filed a fresh chargesheet before the Rae Bareli court, dropping conspiracy charges against the eight leaders. This came as a relief to Advani and the others who had been named in the consolidated chargesheet before the Lucknow court.

 But after the change of government at the Centre, the CBI had virtually supported Bhure before the Supreme Court by submitting that it favoured transfer of the case against Advani and the others to Lucknow.

 The accused before the Rae Bareli court have not been charged with conspiring to demolish the structure but with offences like promoting enmity and hurting religious sentiments and belief.

 The Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, however, noted today that it was for the Uttar Pradesh government, if it so desired, to issue a fresh notification after consulting the high court.

 Soon after the ruling today, the Babri Masjid Action Committee convener and oldest plaintiff in the case, 85-year-old Mohammad Hashim Ansari, accused the Mulayam Singh Yadav government of being hand in glove with the BJP.

 The committee and the Muslim Personal Law Board had been lobbying for a fresh notification by the government for an integrated trial.

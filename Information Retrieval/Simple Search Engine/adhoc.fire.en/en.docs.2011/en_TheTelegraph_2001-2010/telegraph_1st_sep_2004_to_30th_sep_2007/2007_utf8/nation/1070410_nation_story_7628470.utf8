 Anger after AMU death

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Aligarh, April 9: Modelled on Oxford and Cambridge, Aligarh Muslim University had evolved out of Sir Syed Ahmed Khans vision of a modern seat of learning. Today, anger brews on the institutes campus stained by student blood.

 A day after the death of Mohammad Saquib Ali, who was caught in a crossfire between two rival groups, angry students suspended classes, marched through the sprawling grounds and observed two minutes silence before sending his body to his home state Orissa.

 We are controlling our anger with great pain, said president of the AMU students union Nafis Ali.

 Saquib, a BCom student studying for his final year exams, had stepped out of the Mohammad Azad Library around 1.30 at night when he was caught in the crossfire between the student groups that had clashed earlier in the day on April 7. Shot in the chest, he slumped to the ground.

 Sensing they had hit the wrong person, the assailants escaped. The 22-year-old was declared dead yesterday.

 This wasnt the first time violence had erupted on the universitys campus and AMU students blame links between some fellow students and criminal elements.

 A month ago, a group of students raided a hostel and assaulted three boarders as they had refused to offer protection money. Women students as well as a section of teachers complain of sexual harassment.

 These students were rusticated from the campus. Yet they try to disrupt peace with the help of anti-socials, said Sulaiman Md Khan, the general secretary of the students union.

 Saquibs murder coincided with the resignation of vice-chancellor Naseem Ahmad, who was under pressure from a section of student leaders who were demanding relaxation in attendance and withdrawal of the expulsion order against 30-odd students.

 The vice-chancellor, a Haryana cadre IAS officer, had been appointed in 2002 to keep an eye on the volatile law and order situation on the campus. This has been the scene since the last 12 years when all the vice-chancellors happened to be IAS officers. Naseem Ahmad was the fourth VC from the service cadre, said Mohammad Arif, one of the 28,000 students who stay in campus hostels.

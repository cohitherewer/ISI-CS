 Lalu finds virtues in Emergency

 Lalu Prasad: For discipline

 Lucknow, April 25: Lalu Prasad was jailed during Emergency, but has far too many reasons to feel happy about it.

 Not the least important of them was the birth of his daughter during those turbulent days of 1975, when the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (Misa) was the buzzword. It was also sweet enough to become her name Misa Kumari.

 It (Emergency) was necessary to curb the lack of discipline in the country and to create national leaders like me, he told an election rally in Varanasi where he tried to drum up support for RJD and Congress candidates.

 Us samay desh mein kadai ki zaroorat thi, is liye Emergency lagayi gayi thi (the country needed discipline then, that is why Emergency was imposed), Lalu Prasad said.

 The railway minister felt enforcing tough laws during Emergency was the only way to keep tongues on leash. He referred to Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackerays barbs at President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam on the delay in deciding on Parliament attack convict Mohammad Afzals mercy plea. Thackeray had wondered if Kalam couldnt read the petition because of his long hair.

 Lalu Prasad said if the need arises, Emergency should be imposed again. Dubara Emergency ki zaroorat paregi, to kyo nahi hoga (if it is needed in future, why not)? 

 He conceded that he could never have become the leader that he is, but for Emergency. Agar Emergency nahi hoti to hum neta bante kya (had there not been any Emergency, would I have ever become a leader)? he said.

 Lalu Prasad spoke of his key role in making Jayaprakash Narayans total revolution a success. It was me who, as the then president of the students union, launched the movement. 

 He didnt forget to mention that those who rule Bihar now earned their stripes during Emergency. 

 Aaj jo log Bihar chala rahein hain, woh bhi usi Emergency se nikle hain (those who are ruling Bihar today emerged from the politics during Emergency). 

 The list of such leaders also includes Nitish Kumar, but Lalu Prasad mocked him, saying he had become chief minister by chance. 

 There were reasons why he felt Nitish shouldnt be where he is. During the tenure of my wife (Rabri Devi) as chief minister, children were abducted but returned home safely. But now, the little ones, abducted by goons, are found dead on rail tracks, Lalu Prasad said.

 Concerned Congress plays safe

 Sonia, Pranab: Worried but wary 

 New Delhi, March 14: Congress leaders swift expressions of concern at the Nandigram firing today couldnt hide their partys dilemma in its dealings with the CPM.

 Sonia Gandhi expressed deep concern, told the Bengal Congress to keep the central party updated and advised state leaders to help the injured.

 Defence minister and Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee sought a detailed account from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee over the phone and gently told him to avoid using force in such situations.

 His cabinet colleague from Bengal, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, wrote to the chief minister saying the firing would only provoke the tension.

 He advised Bhattacharjee to personally intervene in the matter without assigning it to any other person, either from the government or from the party.

 But a central ministers reply to a question summed up the Congresss constraints.

 Asked if Sonia would fly to Nandigram like she had to Orissas Kalinga Nagar, where police firing had killed tribals protesting land acquisition in January 2006, he said: Do you want us to sacrifice our government so soon?

 Das Munshi, reminded of the Prime Ministers lavish praise of Bhattacharjee last week, said: The PM of the country has to take everyone along with him. If the Bengal CM is thinking of industrial development after 30 years of stagnancy, isnt that a reason to be satisfied?

 Sources in the Prime Ministers Office said they had no idea if Manmohan Singh had spoken to Bhattacharjee today.

 If yesterdays rumpus by Left MPs in the House had left the Congress shocked and disgusted, Nandigram reinforced its feeling of helplessness.

 Sources said though Bhattacharjee had briefed Mukherjee and home minister Shivraj Patil, he hadnt been forthcoming with the other ministers from Bengal.

 Das Munshis letter said that for the past four days, he had been trying in vain to speak to the chief minister about a reported build-up in Nandigram.

 Today, he got his information from Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamul Congress MPs, as well as district Congress workers.

 Since the reports couldnt be verified Mamata alleged that an entire TV crew had been abducted and a local Congressman spoke of 22 killed, 500 hit by bullets and 200 asphyxiated Das Munshi avoided figures at his media briefing.

 He wouldnt react to the CPMs allegation of Naxalites and overground political opponents engineering the violence.

 The I amp;B minister said the state units had been given the leeway to take on the ruling parties whichever way they wanted to, especially in Left-ruled Kerala, Tripura and Bengal. He rejected charges of double standards.

 We have no special arrangement to say something (about the Left) here (in Delhi) and (something different) there (in Bengal). We have taken a strong stand on Singur and Nandigram and in some cases, have worked in tandem with the Trinamul Congress.

 Congress sources ruled out any central leader hitching himself to the Mamata bandwagon right away.

 They said the job at hand was to see the budget session through without spats between the allies. To ensure that, there was no way the Congress in Delhi would get ballistic on Nandigram and Singur.

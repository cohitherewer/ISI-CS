 Silicon Valley techies return

 New York, May 14 (PTI): Indias fast growing economy and galloping information technology sector are attracting more and more professionals from the Silicon Valley back home, a research group today said.

 Estimates of The Indus Entrepreneur group say around 60,000 Indians may have returned in recent years.

 The report also said that no region in the US has been more affected by this trend than the Silicon Valley. 

 The Indus Entrepreneur reported in 2003 that between 15,000 and 20,000 Indians had returned. The trend had continued with about 40,000 more going back in the last four years, Vish Mishra, a charter member of the organisation, told San Jose Mercury News.

 A senior venture partner with Clearstone Ventures, Mishra said the flow of investment capital to India has also expanded, much of it from the Silicon Valley venture capital firms.

 Clearstone Ventures partner also has an office in Mumbai, like many other firms that are either based in the Silicon Valley or originated there.

 In the 12-month period that ended in August 2006, venture capital firms invested $2 billion in early and late-stage companies, Mishra said. 

 The Indus Entrepreneur report quotes a study released earlier this year by Anna-Lee Saxenian of the University of California, Berkeley, and by Duke University as saying that Indians comprised 15 per cent of all Silicon Valley start-ups.

 The study also found that 53 per cent of the science and engineering workforce in the Silicon Valley is foreign-born, and that a quarter of immigrant-populated engineering and scientific companies in the US in the past decade were set up by Indians. 

 These companies piled $52 billion in sales and created 450,000 jobs.

 Mulayam assets papers with CBI

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mayavati, Mulayam 

 Lucknow, July 9: The Uttar Pradesh Assembly today sent the CBI documents it had sought on Mulayam Singh Yadavs assets.

 The central agency is probing a Rs 10-crore disproportionate wealth case against the former chief minister under orders from the Supreme Court.

 The CBI had asked the Assembly secretariat for the records of Mulayams assets declaration in 1977, when he became an MLA for the first time. The agency wants to compare the 1977 figures with the assets declared by the Samajwadi Party leader before this years state elections.

 The CBI had sent the letter on Saturday and we despatched the documents today, said principal secretary (Assembly) R.P. Pandey.

 In 1977, it was not mandatory to make a detailed assets declaration but Mulayam had done so in the income-tax files he had submitted to the Assembly.

 Assembly sources said in 1977, Mulayam had declared 2.53 acres of farmland and a house at his village, Saifai, a jeep worth Rs 10,000, a Bajaj scooter, a balance of Rs 9,355.20 in his account with the Bank of Indias Karhal branch, and another of Rs 3,100 with a Lucknow bank.

 His entire property was valued at Rs 42,955 then. Mulayams 2007 declaration says he is worth Rs 2.25 crore.

 The charge against him, made in a petition before the apex court by Vishwanath Chaturvedi, a trade union leader with Congress links, is that Mulayam and his family had amassed crores of rupees by corrupt means.

 Chaturvedi claims that the Samajwadi leader made Rs 10 crore in the two years from the time he became chief minister in September 2003 till the petition was filed in December 2005.

 The CBI is believed to be in the final stages of its investigation and is likely to hand its report to the Supreme Court next week.

 The probe had been slowed down by lack of government cooperation when the Samajwadi Party was in power till May this year. Mayavati is now believed to be eager to pay Mulayam back for sanctioning her prosecution by the CBI in the Taj corridor case after the election results came in.

 This could have led to her arrest, preventing her from becoming chief minister. But governor T.V. Rajeswar came to her rescue, refusing to put his stamp on the sanction.

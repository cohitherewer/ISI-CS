 Sanjay at CBI office

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 24: Sanjay Dutt today made an appearance at the CBI office, as ordered by the Supreme Court.

 The actor (PTI picture left) reached the CBI office around 3pm with friend Yusuf Nullwala, also convicted in the Bombay blasts case. 

 Sanjay left 20 minutes after meeting the officers concerned and signing an attendance register, a source said. He was very polite and cooperative. He had a cup of tea and left, said a CBI official.

 After he got out on bail and reached Mumbai yesterday, Sanjay has stayed inside his house. 

 The Munnabhai star will have to make an appearance at the CBI office every Friday between 9am and 5pm. 

 This is just a way of ensuring discipline during the time a convict is out on bail, the source said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 In London, a Big love-in

 AMIT ROY 

 Shilpas sister Shamita at the premiere

 London, May 9: In Northern Ireland while old enemies met yesterday to put the past behind them, in Leicester Square in London an equally momentous love-in was taking place between Shilpa Shetty and one of her former tormentors on Celebrity Big Brother, Danielle Lloyd.

 The two NBFs (new best friends, to the uninitiated) posed together at the world premiere of Life in a Metro, Shilpa in a Rocky S ghaghra (I didnt want to do the usual sari) and Danielle in a sexy Eric Way black dress slit to the thigh in the manner decreed for Page 3 girls who target footballers Danielle has been through a couple since her ignominious departure from CBB.

 Danielle pointed out she had been quick to apologise to Shilpa the moment she came out of CBB. 

 Shilpa invited me here, she said. Ive come to support her. Its my first Bollywood movie and Im really excited.

 The one towering personality not invited to the premiere was the former leader of the anti-Shilpa gang, Jade Goody, who had apparently been invited and then disinvited on the orders of Max Clifford. 

 Clifford, a wise old bird who masterminds the global operations of Shilpa Shetty Inc., was not going to have Jade upstage his client on her biggest day since her last big day. 

 Shilpa cited security as the reason for excluding Jade and added it was Maxs decision we didnt want the focus to shift. 

 With Shilpa arrived her mother Sunanda, but this time kid sister Shamita came along, too. Also, there were Metros director Anurag Basu, who denied the film had been reshaped to give Shilpa much more of a starring role, and producer Ronnie Screwvala, plus assorted Indian celebs, including actor Dalip Tahil, Dolly Thakore, a Mumbai personality, and Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East who had raised Shilpas predicament in the House of Commons. 

 The Telegraph was unable to see Metro last night but there were mixed opinions from those who sat through the movie at the Empire cinema in Leicester Square. 

 One woman journalist who had seen an earlier press viewing said she walked out after 20 minutes but an Asian woman lawyer specialising in medical negligence said: This is the first Indian movie I have seen in eight years I loved it. 

 One male Asian journalist said he had already seen the movie and trashed it; an Asian actor said he loved bits of it but not the aspect with Shilpa in it, while another opinion was it was, on the whole, good. 

 One tidbit of information that was confirmed was that Shilpas new perfume would be called S2 after her initials, SS. 

 As is the practice at London premieres, Shilpa walked the red carpet, posed for the photographers, waved to the populace pressed against the crash barriers adorned with posters from Metro, and then did quick sound bites with journalists from television, radio, and then the print and online media, in descending order of importance. 

 The CBB race row had helped her career, she was honest enough to admit. 

 It made me a stronger person and a more famous person, of course, she agreed. 

 She added: This is the first ever Leicester Square premiere for an Indian movie (not strictly true). Its something that I once dreamed of but never imagined would happen.

 She said of the film, which features a collection of stories set in Mumbai: Audiences are ready and looking for something different, for interesting cinema. 

 Asked whether she would move to the UK she answered: I love my country. I am very proud to be Indian. 

 She said the Richard Gere kiss row had been blown out of proportion. That is not the sensibility of a majority of people in India its just the lunatic fringe. 

 Nasreen Munni Kabir, who has written and made documentaries on Indian cinema, commented: This is a key film for Shilpas career because for the first time an actor is recognised in England before the film comes out. I have never seen so many crowds for any film before. But if the film appeals, it will be very good for Indian cinema in general. 

 Even if its success is so, so, remarked Kabir, it would still be important for her career in India because she has not made a top film for a long time. 

 Today, the Shilpa bandwagon left for a premiere of Metro in Dubai which is to be followed by a third in Mumbai.

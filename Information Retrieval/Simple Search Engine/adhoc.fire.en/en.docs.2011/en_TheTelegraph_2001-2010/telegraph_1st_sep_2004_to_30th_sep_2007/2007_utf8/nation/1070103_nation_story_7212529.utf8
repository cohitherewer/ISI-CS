 Minority cells set the price for votes

 Mulayam: First choice

 New Delhi, Jan. 2: Almost all major Muslim religious groups in Uttar Pradesh have for the first time joined hands to demand a price from a willing political party for the crucial minority votes in the Assembly polls likely to be held in April.

 Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav is the first choice for them. If he fails to meet their demands, they would start negotiations with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayavati.

 Besides asking for commitment on a number of demands for the betterment of the community, the Muslim outfits are also planning to seek from the political party they finally support a certain number of seats where they would put up candidates of their choice.

 These organisations the Jamiat-e-Islami, Deoband school, Barelvi school, Tablig-e-Jamiat, Jamiat-ul-Ahle Hadis and the Jamiat-e-Ulema have already formed a core group to prepare a list of demands on behalf of Muslims and carry out negotiations with political parties.

 These six groups have considerable influence over the majority of the Muslim population in Uttar Pradesh.

 The core group, which consists of the top leadership of various organisations, will meet in the third week of January to prepare a charter of demands which will form the basis of our negotiations either with the Samajwadi Party or with the Bahujan Samaj Party, the coordinator of the core group and Jamiat-e-Islami political affairs secretary, Mujtaba Farooq, said.

 In the core group, the Jamiat-e-Ulema is yet to depute its representative as it does not want to come out openly at the moment though its leader Mahmood Madani has given his blessings to us, he said.

 There is unanimity of opinion that we should first talk to Mulayam and, if he agrees to our demands, we should openly campaign for the Samajwadi Party, he added.

 Sources in these organisations said the BSP is their second choice partly because of Mayavatis track record of aligning with the BJP whenever she needed and partly because of her recent statement charging Muslims with voting only for fundamentalists.

 As these organisations plan to seek a certain number of seats for themselves, Farooq said: Only the candidates of our own choice can remain loyal to the community. A Muslim candidate fielded by a political party has a tendency to remain more loyal to the party than the community.

 The core group is also in touch with various individuals and groups engaged in political campaigns in different parts of the state, Farooq said. 

 The sources said the initiative followed the realisation that division in minority votes would not only harm the interests of the community but also help the BJP.

 On Mulayam being their first choice, Farooq said there is a perception in the community that the Samajwadi Party is still the most powerful secular party in Uttar Pradesh. Though the Congress is trying its best, its rise still remains uncertain in the state where the BJP is so well entrenched.

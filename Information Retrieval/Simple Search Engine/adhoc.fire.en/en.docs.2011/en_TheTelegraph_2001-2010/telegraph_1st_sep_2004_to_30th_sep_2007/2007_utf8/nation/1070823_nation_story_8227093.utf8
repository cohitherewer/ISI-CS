 Aussie hospital game for Haneef

 Melbourne, Aug. 22 (PTI): Mohammed Haneef could get re-registered for work in Queensland as early as next month.

 Stating this, Queensland health minister Stephen Robertson said he would be happy to have the Indian doctor back at the Gold Coast Hospital.

 Weve made it clear that we are prepared to accept Dr Haneef back if that is the outcome of the extraordinary processes that hes been put through by an increasingly incompetent federal minister, Robertson said. 

 He was quoted by The Australian as saying that he understood Haneef could be re-registered in September, although that would be a matter for the medical board to determine.

 Yesterday, an Australian court quashed the governments decision to cancel Haneefs work visa.

 Haneefs lawyers today released the full transcript of an interview of the doctor with Australian Federal Police to counter the selective release of information by Australian authorities.

 His lawyer Peter Russo was quoted as saying: He (Haneef) wants all matters raised with him by the federal police and his answers put in the public arena because of the continuing attempts to slander his name by innuendo and selective release of information by the government and federal police spokespersons. 

 He said the transcript made it clear there was no basis to allege wrongdoing against Haneef, earlier charged with recklessly supporting terrorists.

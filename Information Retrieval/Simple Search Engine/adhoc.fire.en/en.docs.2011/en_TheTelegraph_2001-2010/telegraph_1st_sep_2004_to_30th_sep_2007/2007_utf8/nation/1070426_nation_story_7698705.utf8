 Valley pills in hand, eye on Pak

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 25: The Centre is ready with a set of suggestions to address problems in Kashmir, but none of them can be implemented without Pakistans consent.

 A key recommendation of one of the four working groups set up by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is to make the Line of Control irrelevant.

 The working group on strengthening ties across the LoC has recommended that travelling should not be restricted to divided families. Pilgrims, tourists and patients should be allowed to move across the LoC, but only in groups.

 The group wants several new routes to open up along the LoC, including Kargil-Skardu and Jammu-Sialkote, and a series of measures to increase trade and commerce.

 There is also a proposal to constitute a consultative group of 10 legislators from both sides to discuss social, economic, cultural and travel issues.

 All of these suggestions need Islamabads nod before they are acted upon.

 Another group has proposed starting a landline and mobile phone service with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The suggestion is likely to be opposed by Indian security agencies. Officials said communication lines can be opened only when terrorism is under control.

 Delhi feels most of the recommendations made by the working groups would go on to meet the aspirations of the people of Kashmir and help address their problems. The government says it has got an overwhelming response from mainstream political parties in the Valley on the suggestions. 

 But India also realises that no step can be taken without assistance from Pakistan. The Prime Minister had said yesterday that the deliberations of the Kashmir round-table would be shared with Islamabad.

 Government officials said Pakistans intention in seeking a solution to the Kashmir dispute will be reflected in the way it responds to the suggestions, which are for the welfare of the Kashmiris.

 Singh has formed two new panels for the implementation of the working group recommendations. 

 The Prime Minister has also appointed a high-power committee headed by defence minister A.K Antony to study the feasibility of scrapping the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, which is one of the suggestions. 

 The committee was set up when the Congresss alliance partner in Kashmir, the Peoples Democratic Party, threatened to walk out of the government in Jammu and Kashmir over the armed forces act.

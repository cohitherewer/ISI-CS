 Sex abuse bill covers maids

 New Delhi, Aug. 17 (PTI): The proposed law to shield women from sexual harassment in the workplace covers domestic helps and labourers in the unorganised sector.

 The Protection of Women Against Sexual Harassment Bill has been forwarded to the law ministry. We hope to introduce the bill in the current session of Parliament, women and child development minister Renuka Chaudhry said today.

 Girija Vyas, who heads the National Commission for Women, said the ministry had incorporated all the panels suggestions. The inclusion of maids and domestic workers in the proposed bill is a welcome provision.

 The bill also envisages constitution of an internal as well as a local complaints committee to deal with cases of sexual harassment.

 Renuka hate mail

 The implementation of the domestic violence act has driven many men to write abusive emails to her ministry, Chaudhry said. We have received a number of abusive e-mails from men.

 Violence by husbands robs women of their self-esteem, the minister said. The legislation has proved to be a boon for many women.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 A day, just for campus thugs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, Jan. 1: Wild ways have been a rage on celluloid. The footloose have often grabbed eyeballs. But colleges in Gujarat have gone much beyond imitating art in life they have given their wayward a festival.

 So, a tapori day has stormed its way to the calendar of campus festivals, sitting alongside mushier and colourful rivals like the chocolate day, rose day, mismatch day, jeans day, balloon day and a tradition day.

 In colleges that have given it pride of place, the celebration of tapori a slang loosely used to describe the crude and the ill-mannered day means shedding of inhibitions, giving expressions a wacky edge and going wild.

 Guarang Jani, who teaches sociology at Gujarat University, says the tradition (of youth festivals) is three decades old, but admits tapori day is a recent addition.

 Colleges dont approve of the festival, also called mawaali day, but say there is little they can do to stop it. Authorities promote, encourage and manage other celebrations, but these are usually the more genteel kind, says Jani.

 Chocolate day and rose day are meant to express love, while mismatch day, as the name suggests, is meant to look funny and absurd. On tradition day, one is supposed to wear clothes that reveal cultural identities.

 But, not everyone appears to be pleased.

 Juli Shah, a student of S.L.U. Arts and Commerce College, is uneasy at the thought, saying a tapori day celebration is sheer nuisance. Her reason: boys often take undue liberty on the pretext of the festival, dress up as oddly as they can, mimic villains and generally act absurd.

 But Julis principal, Siral Mehta, has no qualms, as long as the antics are within the campus. I dont want them outside the gate. They should not bunk classes. Thats all. I will allow everything on the campus, she says.

 Mehtas only worry is not student trouble, but the emphasis on clothes. How they look and what they wear becomes too important. That is not a happy thing.

 New Delhi, June 27: Around 10 this morning, dish antennas atop Paradise and Roxy in central Calcutta and some 750 other cinemas across the country began to download Awarapan, Mukesh Bhatts latest offering. 

 The film delivered via satellite will be housed in digital cinema storage and projection systems in each of these theatres until Friday when electronic licences will allow screening to begin. 

 Technology is changing the way films are distributed in India. Computers and satellites are facilitating the simultaneous release of films in more places than ever before and providing superior digital film formats to the audience. 

 Its translating into faster revenues from films and a happier audience, said Mukesh Sherigar, a senior manager with United Films Organizers Moviez (UFO Moviez), a Mumbai-based company that is delivering films through satellite links to 750 theatres across India and has set its sights on reaching another 2,000 by December 2008. 

 Distributors estimate that more than 1,200 among Indias 10,000-odd theatres are already equipped with digital cinema systems. Chennai-based Pyramid Saimira plans to expand its own network from 325 screens now to 2,000 by 2011. 

 Theres usually a time lag of a few weeks between release in a large Class A city and smaller B and C class towns, said a senior official with Pyramid. This time lag makes room for film piracy. 

 With digital films sent simultaneously to more theatres, we can reach more audiences faster and reduce the scope of piracy, the official said. 

 Traditional celluloid prints were hand-delivered after journeys by air, rail, bus, and even bicycles depending on the location of the theatre. But a full-length feature film compressed to 15 GB data may be transmitted via satellite link to each theatre in a network. Distributors then decide which ones should be given an electronic key or licence that allows them to screen it. 

 Distributors say satellite-delivered films will also reduce the cost of acquiring prints. A typical print costs anywhere from Rs 50,000 to Rs 70,000. 

 With most films not lasting more than two weeks, theatres find it less expensive to download the films and screen them for a fee of less than Rs 10,000 a week, Sherigar told The Telegraph. 

 Apne, Awarapan and Aap ka Suroor are among this weeks releases sent by UFO Moviez to theatres in its network. 

 Some cinema owners have used the technology to add more shows. With traditional prints, we sometimes had to adjust our show timings to share with others, said Arijit Dutta, owner of Calcuttas Priya theatre. Digital technology has helped Priya increase the number of shows from four a day to six a day, Dutta told said. 

 This technology also helps us avoid the hassles of transport and storage, said Bobby Singh, owner of Paradise and Roxy theatres in Calcutta.

 Blow to DMK scion

 New Delhi, May 15 (PTI): The Supreme Court today stayed the murder trial of former DMK minister T. Kiruttinan in which M.K. Azhagiri, the eldest son of M. Karuna-nidhi, is the prime accused. 

 The court also asked the Tamil Nadu government why the case should not be transferred to Karnataka.

 A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhan asked the state to file its response within four weeks after a witness apprehended a threat to his life, citing the attack on the Tamil daily Dinakarans office in which three employees were killed.

 The witness, Suresh Kumar, filed the petition seeking transfer of the trial, now being held before the additional sessions judge, Madurai, to any other court in Karnataka on the ground that a free and fair trial could not be held as Azhagiri wielded enormous influence in the temple city.

 Suresh furnished to the court various newspaper cuttings on the May 9 attack, allegedly carried out by Azhagiris followers.

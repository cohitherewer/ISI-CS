 3 little pigs... sorry, pups

 - Fairy tale in political correctness drama

 AMIT ROY 

 sounds offending? 

 London, March 20: In deference to Muslim sentiment, the much-loved story of the three little pigs was changed to that of three little puppies for a childrens performance in Yorkshire last week, it emerged today.

 But local councillors, angry that a childrens favourite was being tampered with in the name of political correctness, have changed the three little puppies back to the original three little pigs. 

 The plan was for pupils from the Honley Church of England Junior School in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, to perform Roald Dahls version of Little Red Riding Hood, which features the pigs, at the Town Hall in June.

 They were to be part of the Kirklees Primary Music Festival, where hundreds of other children from 63 schools in Kirklees would sing along with the words of the poem.

 But then it struck some of the festival organisers that Muslim parents and their children might be embarrassed at having to sing about pigs. 

 Although no complaint had been received from Muslims, the decision was taken to substitute puppies for pigs.

 Gill Goodswen, a committee member and head teacher of Stile Common Junior School, explained: We feared that some Muslim children wouldnt sing along to the words about pigs. If changing a few words avoids offence, then we will do so.

 Steve Price, the head of the Honley School, said he was not part of the decision-making process but added that he could well understand some head teachers being careful about not causing offence.

 Others, however, felt that traditional English culture should not be sacrificed when there was no intention to cause offence.

 Terry Lyons, an independent councillor, said he thought the decision was pandering to extremists. He expressed concern that the switch would encourage far-right groups who could feed on the discontent provoked by the change.

 Jim Dodds, the councils cabinet member for childrens services, commented: Everyone knows the story of The Three Little Pigs. We have all read them to our own children and grandchildren. 

 He insisted: I am sure that no one is offended by any wording within any of those traditional stories. As well-meaning as it may have been behind the thinking of the organisers of the festival to adapt the wording of the story so as not to cause offence as they saw it, it was a mistake, and it was not the right decision so lets stick with tradition and not get distracted by errors of judgement.

 It is not difficult to understand why Dahls The Three Little Pigs, taken from his 1982 Revolting Rhymes, might not necessarily be a favourite with Muslim children.

 In the normal version, the first two pigs are eaten by the big, bad wolf but the third lures him down the chimney into boiling water.

 In Dahls version, Muslim children would have this to say about what the wolf did to the first pig:

 He shouted: Bacon, pork and ham! 

 Oh, what a lucky Wolf I am! 

 And though he ate the pig quite fast, 

 He carefully kept the tail till last.

 The wolf would not make a deal with the second pig: 

 The Wolf replied, Not on your nelly! 

 And soon the pig was in his belly. 

 Then the third pig appeals for help to Red Riding Hood, who despatches the wolf: 

 Once more the maidens eyelid flickers.

 She draws the pistol from her knickers. 

 Once more she hits the vital spot, 

 And kills him with a single shot. 

 Of course, all children, not just Muslims, may need trauma therapy after Dahls final verse:

 Ah, Piglet, you must never trust 

 Young ladies from the upper crust. 

 For now, Miss Riding Hood, one notes, 

 Not only has two wolfskin coats, 

 But when she goes from place to place, 

 She has a PIGSKIN TRAVELLING CASE.

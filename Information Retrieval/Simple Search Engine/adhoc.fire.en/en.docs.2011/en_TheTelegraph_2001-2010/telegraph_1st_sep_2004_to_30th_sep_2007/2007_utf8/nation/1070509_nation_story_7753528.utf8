 Cabinet loses cover

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR

 New Delhi, May 8: The Supreme Court today put the Centre in an awkward situation by citing the Right to Information Act to justify its desire to peruse a cabinet advisory to the President.

 The court wanted access to the communication between President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and the Union cabinet over a demand for the removal of Naveen Chawla as election commissioner.

 The court had earlier sought reports on graver matters such as advice given to the President on central rule. But this is the first time it has cited the information act a potent weapon that has empowered ordinary people to be briefed on an unpublicised cabinet decision.

 The BJP, now fighting a CD battle with the poll panel, had accused Chawla of bias because of his alleged links with the Congress and petitioned the President for his removal. Kalam had forwarded the plea to the cabinet for advice.

 In the court today, additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam initially resisted disclosing the privileged communication to the court, but he virtually gave up after the bench pointed out that privilege on such documents could not be claimed after the Right to Information Act.

 What advice was given by cabinet to the President. It is not on record before the court. If the President referred the matter to you, advice has to be given, the bench, headed by Justice Ashok Bhan, told Subramaniam. After the RTI Act, I dont know what privileges you have, the bench added.

 Subramaniam replied: We have no problem showing it to the court but will not show it to the petitioners.

 The court then asked him to keep the documents ready as it would like to see them and posted the matter for tomorrow.

 The request was made by the court while hearing arguments on a petition by BJP leader Jaswant Singh seeking proper course of action on the petition to the President.

 Singh has been contending that the President should have sought the opinion of the chief election commissioner, instead of referring the representation to the cabinet for advice. 

 Former attorney-general Soli J. Sorabjee, appearing for the petitioner, said the Constitution did not contemplate advice by the cabinet as election commissioners have to be free of control of the executive. 

 The Centre, however, has been contending that the opinion of the poll panel chief had to be sought only if the executive found the allegations to be intelligible and cogent. Chawla had denied the charges levelled in the petition.

 BJP bursts into nuke deal assault

 New Delhi, Aug. 4: The BJP has slammed the deal with the US as an assault on the countrys nuclear sovereignty and foreign policy options, belying the perception that most within the party were for the agreement.

 Party leaders, who went into a huddle last evening, today demanded a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to scan the text of the agreement and said further action should be suspended till Parliament approved the pact.

 A statement issued on behalf of the party by senior leaders Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie also called for an appropriate constitutional amendment to make parliamentary ratification a must for all international deals that affect the nations sovereignty, territorial integrity and security.

 Observers said the BJPs stand was baffling as the partys top leaders hadnt expressed any serious reservation when they were briefed by the government.

 Government sources said Brajesh Mishra, who was national security adviser in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, and former party chief L.K. Advani had been shown the draft of the agreement and that BJP insiders had indicated a day before that there was broad satisfaction.

 Sinha and Shourie said the deal was designed to circumvent, roll back and, finally, eliminate Indias strategic nuclear weapons programme. The government, they added, was spreading a canard through its propaganda that the deal recognised India as a de facto nuclear weapons state.

 Sinha, who like Advani and Jaswant Singh was part of yesterdays confabulations at Vajpayees home, said these were preliminary observations and fresh points would emerge with greater understanding of the deals salient features.

 The demand for a JPC has the potential to create trouble in Parliaments monsoon session. The government is also unlikely to heed the demand for an amendment to make parliamentary approval necessary for international treaties.

 Senior Congress leaders pointed out that India, unlike the US, does not have a presidential system of governance and the Prime Minister here enjoys full mandate to finalise such deals.

 But the BJP has ensured that the deal will not get a hearty parliamentary salutation.

 The BJP statement said each party was required to implement the agreement in accordance with its national laws and regulations. There is no doubt, therefore, that the implementation of this agreement shall be governed by the provisions of the Hyde act, the US Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and licensing requirements relating to the supply of nuclear materials to India.

 Sinha, a former foreign minister, had made this point yesterday, too. He had said it would be nave to assume that the bilateral 123 Agreement could be read separately from US domestic laws like the Hyde act that call for ending nuclear cooperation in the event of a nuclear test.

 The BJP asserted that only certain aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle were covered under the agreement, and said the US would retain the right of end-use verification of all its supplies, which meant American inspectors would do the rounds of Indias nuclear installations.

 Even the commitment on fuel supplies was vague and futuristic, the statement added. It also objected to the creation of a national reprocessing facility under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, saying none of the five nuclear powers had such a facility.

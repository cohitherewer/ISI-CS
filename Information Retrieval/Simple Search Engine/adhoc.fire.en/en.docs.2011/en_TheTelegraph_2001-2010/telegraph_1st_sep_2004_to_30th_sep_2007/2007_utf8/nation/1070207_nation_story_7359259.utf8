 Mufti amp; party pick up Azad gauntlet

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mufti Mohammad Sayeed

 Srinagar, Feb. 6: Kashmirs worst rights abuse scandal threatens to split the ruling coalition, with all Peoples Democratic Party legislators today deciding to give up their personal security in response to what they described as a challenge thrown by chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad.

 Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, who headed the Congress-PDP government before Azad took over in line with a power-rotation agreement between the parties, asked the government to withdraw his security in a letter to the chief minister.

 I am writing this letter to request you to please withdraw my personal security and that of Ms Mehbooba Mufti, MP, with immediate effect, he wrote from his Delhi residence. Mehbooba, Muftis daughter, is president of the PDP.

 In the evening, all PDP legislators followed suit, raising fears of a split in the ruling coalition. Finance minister Tariq Hamid Qarra, who is a senior PDP leader, said: The chief minister has challenged us and asked us to withdraw our security and we have done the same.

 Azad had yesterday dismissed demands by political parties for demilitarisation and withdrawal of special powers to security forces as attempts to play to the gallery. As the Valley erupted in protests against fake encounter killings, the PDP and the Opposition National Conference had said this would reduce rights abuses.

 If the legislators give in writing that the security around their houses and offices and bullet-proof vehicles be withdrawn in 24 hours, I will write to the government of India to withdraw the security forces from the state, Azad said.

 In response, ally Mufti wrote today: You have linked the acceptance of these suggestions to personal security arrangements for politicians. This is nothing peculiar to J amp;K as public personalities are protected everywhere in the country irrespective of all circumstances. 

 We believe surrendering personal security by us would earn your endorsement to our suggestions and you would take steps in this direction so that the people get relief.

 While the Congress did not react to the development, the National Conference dismissed it as pure drama. I only wonder why Sayeed did not make the move (withdrawal of special powers to security forces) when he was himself at the helm of affairs for three years.

 As the spat between the ruling allies raised fears that the government might fall, Qarra said: We are not withdrawing support.

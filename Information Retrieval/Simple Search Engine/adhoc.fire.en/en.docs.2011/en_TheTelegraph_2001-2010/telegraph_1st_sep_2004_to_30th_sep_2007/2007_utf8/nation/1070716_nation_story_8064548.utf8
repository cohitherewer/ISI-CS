 Starlet spares peeping Toms

 Rakhi 

 Sawant wouldnt have liked this kind of an exposure.

 The item girls appearance at a recent show, called The House of Horrors, turned nasty when her bodyguards caught two men peeping into her dressing room, trying to shoot a video of her with their camera phones. 

 Rafiq Ali and Sachin Kumar, who had come to Vile Parles Prime Mall with their families, sneaked into the restricted area of the arcade, where Rakhi was dolling up for the show. 

 What they hadnt bargained for were the 15 bouncers who guard Rakhi at public events. The men had only captured one frame when they were caught red-handed. 

 The peeping Toms would have been in the police net, but Rakhi agreed not to press charges after the wife of one of the men pleaded with her. 

 Later, all gates from where the public could take pictures were blocked as she went through her five-minute ramp walk. The logistics were manageable, as it was an invitation-only show. Only if other models were as lucky as Miss Sawant. 

 Brokers on the mend

 A 

 shadowy group of women brokers involved in the 

 trafficking of young girls came out of their closets to 

 quit their jobs.

 Pained by the consequences of what they had been doing for years, the 12 women recently pledged before a Chennai street crowd that they would not force or cajole girls into flesh trade.

 To show that they meant every word of the vow, these ladies took out diaries carrying the addresses and phone numbers of potential clients and made a bonfire of them on the road. 

 They promised to turn a new leaf. The goal was to find respectable ways of earning their livelihood. One of the women, who had once been a sex worker herself, said she was assailed by the guilt of girls getting AIDS. 

 Olympiad goes green

 Sit 

 for an exam and learn about the environment in the process. 

 The Energy Research Institute (Teri), a Delhi-based environment NGO, is organising a Green Olympiad for school students. The last date for registration is August 15. 

 Schools from across the country and abroad can register for the exam to be held on September 29. Seven schools from the north, south, east and west zones will be selected, along with four institutions from overseas. These schools will then participate in a televised quiz, called the Terra Quiz. The final winner will be chosen from this contest. 

 It is a great opportunity for school students to learn about the environment and issues related to it. But it is also important for us, both as an organisation and as a part of this society, to understand the level of awareness among school students, an official of the NGO said.

 Malaria alert

 After 

 the monster monsoon, Mumbai is on an outbreak alert.

 Over 900 cases of malaria were detected last month, Maharashtra public health minister Vimal Mundada said recently. Around 17,000 samples were tested and 913 were found positive. The threat hasnt ended there.

 Anxiety levels have gone up after about 34 cases of chikungunya and nine cases of leptospirosis, six in Pune and three in Mumbai, were found, the minister said.

 To fight the threat of outbreaks in the rural areas, the government has made up its mind to launch Doctor in your village on Independence Day to ensure that people get maximum access to health facilities, Mundada said.

 PM amp; Pawar on farm drive

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN 

 New Delhi, March 23: The Congress and the NCP may be fighting over power in Maharashtra but Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar have decided not to let local problems affect their equations at the Centre. 

 To show they are united on key issues, Singh and Pawar will tour some states to monitor the state of agriculture. The decision was taken at a meeting on Thursday. 

 They will examine why growth in agriculture is still stagnant, why productivity is not increasing and why, barring Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, extension services havent taken off. 

 Sources said Singh is keen to see agriculture growth increase to over 4 per cent. To achieve that, he wants to find out if there is a need to switch from a crop-based approach to a farm-based one. 

 He would also like to know the changes needed in research and extension efforts to help farmers in rain-fed areas. He is expected to look at modifications required in the way markets work so that farmers get better prices. 

 Among the states the two could visit are Maharashtra and Andhra. While Andhra has managed to check farmer suicides, taking steps Singh has in mind, Maharashtras record has been dismal. Despite Singhs appeals to Vilasrao Deshmukh to revive extension services, the chief minister hasnt been responsive, sources said. 

 Sections of the Congress have held Pawar responsible for the problems in food availability and agriculture. But Singh feels Maharashtra cant escape blame.

 The tours will take place before the May 29 meeting of the National Development Council, which is expected to focus on agriculture.

 Sources said Singh wanted to make the larger point that he would not allow the UPA to go astray, no matter what the ground-level compulsions of the Congress were.

 New Delhi, May 4: The Centre is trying to draw up a repatriation treaty with Bangladesh so that women and children who have been smuggled into India can return home.

 There is no institutional mechanism to handle people brought illegally from Bangladesh and Nepal. Hordes of such people are rescued from red-light areas in Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta.

 We had our first round of talks with representatives of the Bangladesh government in December last year. The next round is in Goa between June 12 and 14, said an official in the ministry of women and children.

 We would like to have an institutional set-up in place.

 Officials said there were a number of hurdles in the way of repatriation. Home and foreign ministry representatives hardly attended meetings called by the trafficking advisory committee set up by the ministry of women and children.

 If they ever send somebody, he is an inconsequential officer, said a member of the committee.

 When the UPA government first raised the repatriation issue with Dhaka, it was reluctant to recognise the illegal entrants as their nationals, said a ministry official.

 Roma Devraj, a Delhi University professor and social worker, has been running from pillar to post to get five Bangladeshi teenagers repatriated. Four girls were rescued from Delhi and Mumbai, while the boy had crossed the border by mistake. 

 After negotiations, Bangladesh agreed to take them back and issued travel documents. But Delhi placed several conditions and delayed the process.

 The childrens travel documents have now expired. We have to restart the whole process, Devraj said.

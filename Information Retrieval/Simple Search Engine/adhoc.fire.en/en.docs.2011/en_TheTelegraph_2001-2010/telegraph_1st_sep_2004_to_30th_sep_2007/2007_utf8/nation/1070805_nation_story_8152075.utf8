 Buzz in Big Cities 

Rain over, time to lift the cloud

 Y.S.R. Reddy is convinced that blessings have rained during the years hes been at the helm.

 Special prayers and ceremonies to thank the rain god have been lined up for the surplus rainfall in the past three years. The first of the Varuna pujas was held in July in Mahbubnagar, home to the Priyadarshini Jurala irrigation project.

 The chief minister says the exercise is to please the rain god and to remove divine hurdles planted by the Opposition against the massive irrigation schemes launched by the government.

 The government has spent over Rs 15,000 crore on Jalayagnam, its ambitious irrigation plan of 2004. A sum of Rs 13,000 crore will be invested in projects this year alone. 

 The blitz is seen by many as an attempt by the Congress regime to claim credit for good monsoon and remind people of the spells of drought during the Telugu Desam regime.

 Teachers to check ragging

 A Delhi college might have found a way to tighten the leash on hostel bullies get professors to stay as inmates.

 Students in the hostel of Delhi Universitys Ramjas College will have professors as their neighbours this year. 

 Two faculty members will be living and eating in each hostel to check ragging. Young faculty members are being picked. 

 The college believes they can merge with students better. They will be able to understand the students better than senior faculty members, a college official said. 

 Ramjas is also launching six helplines students can call for complaints related to ragging. 

 The college can be trusted to fight the menace better. Its principal, Rajendra Prasad, was a member of the panel appointed by the Supreme Court to devise anti-ragging strategies. Former CBI chief R.K. Raghavan headed it.

 Bluelines off, Metro zooms

 When the Blueline wheels are jammed, the Metro is in top gear.

 As the buses having gained notoriety for being the capitals killer machines went off the roads, the turnstiles at the Metro were moving faster than ever before.

 On July 22, the rail network ferried 5.27 lakh people, a record for a Sunday. A day before, it carried 7.39 lakh, the highest for a Saturday.

 The daily average is around 6 lakh, Metro sources said. Five more trains are now running to cope with the rush, in addition to the 62 regular ones on the three routes.

 The brakes were slammed on the Bluelines after their owners failed to get clearance from the government. Only 712 of the more than 4,000 buses were found fit during an intensive two-day checking drive. 

 The Delhi Transport Corporation ran its fleet of 2,800, but it wasnt enough. Commuters had to wait for hours to get a bus.

 Screen scare

 Many in a popular hangout zone in the capitals diplomatic enclave had to spend some nerve-racking moments after a bomb alarm forced evacuations last week. 

 The scene of panic was the well-known Chanakya cinema, which received an intimation from an anonymous caller that a bomb had been planted in the complex. 

 Delhi polices bomb-disposal squad swung into action. Several key embassies, including those of the US, are located at stones throw from the hall. The area, Chanakyapuri, is among the most heavily guarded in Delhi.

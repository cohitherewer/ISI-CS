 Suhrid rival questioned again

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 9: The CBI today questioned Singur CPM leader Dibakar Das, the rival Suhrid Dutta accuses of framing him in the Tapasi Malik murder.

 Ami nirdosh, Debu amake phansiye dilo (I am innocent, Debu has framed me), Suhrid had cried out in the Chandernagore courtroom on June 29, the day after his arrest.

 The CBI had already questioned and let off Dibakar on June 28. So the decision to interrogate him again this evening set off a buzz in local CPM circles.

 Dibakar a leader of the local Krishak Sabha, the partys peasant wing used to be the zonal committee secretary in Singur before Suhrid replaced him. His name cropped up in the probe into the December 18 rape and murder of Tapasi, a rising star of the Opposition land resistance, when the CBI arrested Debu Malik.

 Debu, 45, is known to have been close to Dibakar but had apparently switched loyalties to Suhrid (the CPM leadership, though, denies he was ever a party activist).

 He told the CBI that Suhrid, the face of the partys land acquisition efforts in Singur, had sent four men to murder Tapasi but confessed that he had joined them in raping and killing her.

 Many in the party are unwilling to accept Debus statements at face value. Debu had dropped Suhrids name to malign the party and those who were working tirelessly to see the success of the Tata Motors project, Balai Sabui, a local CPM leader had claimed soon after Suhrids arrest.

 Party insiders said Dibakar is close to Hooghly MP Anil Basu, while Suhrid is a loyalist of another MP from the district, Rupchand Pal.

 CBI officials decided to summon Dibakar late in the afternoon today while interrogating a few people from Singur, such as Dina Bandhu Manna, the man who supplied food to labourers working at the Tata project site.

 Dibakar, a CPM Hooghly district committee member, turned up around 6.30pm and left three hours later. Agency officials refused to discuss what they had asked him or what his answers were.

 Singur residents Mousam Sahana and Kesto Barik, too, were questioned today. Seven people, including two local CPM leaders, have been asked to appear before the agency tomorrow. One of them, Tapan Mitra, is a member of the Singur zonal committee.

 Hunt on Net, keep off black buck

 SATISH NANDGAONKAR

 Mumbai, Aug. 29: A popular gaming site is making merry with a black buck while the original hunter cools his heels in a Jodhpur jail.

 Days after Salman Khan was put behind bars for poaching a chinkara, games2win.com has put out a computer game on the perils of hunting protected animals.

 Bollywood Buckwaas is a simple game that invites players to go on a hunting expedition, with the single rule that one cannot shoot a black buck.

 Salman faces a one-year jail term for killing a black buck. His appeal is pending before court.

 Alok Kejriwal, the games2win.com founder, said about 35,000 users had logged in to wield a long-barrelled shotgun since the much-hyped arrest of the star.

 Bored of film dance sequences and want to spend some quality time with nature? We have got the right spot for you. Grab your gun and head out to hunt a little game! Life on the wild side! Just remember one rule do not shoot a black buck! the instructions say, as a Salman look-alike shows off his muscles and wields a shotgun.

 The game is easy to play. A pair of muscular arms holding a gun appears in a jungle full of wild animals. The user has to train the gun on an animal with the help of the computer mouse.

 As lions, jackals, parrots, frogs and hyenas briefly appear in the bushes, the user has to swiftly aim the gun and left-click the mouse to shoot the animal. Black bucks also appear but the player has to avoid shooting them.

 The moment a black buck is shot, a curtain of prison bars descends on the hunter, signalling the end of the game.

 The game initially allots a player 60 seconds. If a player shoots animals other than black bucks, he/she gets additional time and 15 more bullets.

 The player has to keep shooting and accumulating points as the speed with which animals appear increases.

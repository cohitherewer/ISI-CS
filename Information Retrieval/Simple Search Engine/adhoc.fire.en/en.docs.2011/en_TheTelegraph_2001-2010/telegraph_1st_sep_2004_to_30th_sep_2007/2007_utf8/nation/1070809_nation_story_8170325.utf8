 Booker longlist raises Indian hopes

 Lalwani and Hamid

 London, Aug. 8: Another Indian or Pakistani repeating Kiran Desais Booker triumph from last year is probably too much to hope but yesterdays release of the 13 books in the longlist for the much sought-after 50,000 literary prize shows the sub-continent is again in the running. 

 The longlist includes The Reluctant Fundamentalist (Hamish Hamilton) by Pakistani-born author Mohsin Hamid, 36, and two novels from authors of Indian origin Gifted (Viking) by Nikita Lalwani, 34, and Animals People (Simon amp; Schuster) by Indra Sinha, 57. 

 There is always a certain amount of razzmatazz attached to the Booker Prize, which was won by V.S. Naipaul in 1971 for In a Free State; Salman Rushdie for Midnights Children in 1981 (this was also named the Booker of Bookers in 1993); Arundhati Roy in 1997 for The God of Small Things; and Kiran Desai for The Inheritance of Loss last year (her mother Anita Desai was shortlisted three times but never won). 

 The inclusion of two more Indians this year might convince the casual onlooker that the house of Booker has become practically a mama bari for writers from India. All they have to do is dash out a novel and wait for the accolades and the literodollars to roll in, especially if they are young, female and fit the western stereotype of the Asian babe. 

 But it is apparently not like that. 

 All the books chosen are well-crafted and will appeal to a wide readership, insisted the chairman of judges, Sir Howard Davies, director of the London School of Economics. 

 His fellow judges are poet Wendy Cope; Giles Foden, journalist and author of The Last King of Scotland; biographer and critic Ruth Scurr; and actress and writer Imogen Stubbs. 

 The judges have had to work very hard because the longlist of 13 was chosen from 110 entries, with 92 submitted for the prize and 18 called in by the judges. 

 Man Booker, the organisation that runs the literary prize, now in its 39th year, said that the 2007 shortlist of six will be announced on September 6 and the winner on October 16 at an awards ceremony at Guildhall, London. 

 Can the desis pull it off again? After last years victory, hoping for another win seems greedy but statistically, they have a three-in-13 chance. 

 Mohsin Hamid, who grew up in Lahore, Pakistan, attended Princeton and Harvard, and now lives in London, won a Betty Trask Award for his first novel, Moth Smoke. According to the Guardian, The Reluctant Fundamentalist, his second novel, is a quietly told, cleverly constructed fable of infatuation and disenchantment with America. 

 Gifted, the debut novel from Nikita Lalwani, is about a 10-year-old Indian girl, Rumi, who is a genius at mathematics, which means her childhood is being wrecked by her well-meaning but over-ambitious father who is pressurising his daughter to sit Oxbridge entrance early. This really is an everyday tale of over-achieving Indian folk in England. 

 Lalwani, who was born in Kota, Rajasthan, raised in Cardiff and also lives in London, has said that after several years of directing factual television and documentaries at the BBC, she has returned to writing fiction.

 Animals People, by Indra Sinha, is set in a town like Bhopal and tells of what happens to a character who crawls, Mowgli-like, on all fours when a local factory starts spewing out poison. 

 Sinha, who grew up in Mumbai and now lives in Sussex and in the south of France, has said that after schools in India and England, and Eng Lit at Cambridge, I failed to persuade the BBC to let me make documentaries, and instead got a job as an advertising copywriter. This, incidentally, is similar to the route taken by Satyajit Ray and Salman Rushdie.

 The other books on longlist are: Darkmans by Nicola Barker (4th Estate); Self Help by Edward Docx (Picador); The Gift Of Rain by Tan Twan Eng (Myrmidon); The Gathering by Anne Enright (Jonathan Cape); The Welsh Girl by Peter Ho Davies (Sceptre); Mister Pip by Lloyd Jones (John Murray); What Was Lost by Catherine Flynn (Tindal Street); Consolation by Michael Redhill (William Heinemann); Winnie amp; Wolf by A.N. Wilson (Hutchinson).

 Ex-captain gambit wins board game

 Mumbai, April 8: What lawsuit threats failed to do for the cricketers agents, a little influence at the right places seems to have done.

 As the Board of Control for Cricket in India softened today and hinted at relaxing the endorsement cap for players, the buzz was that the cricketers media managers had persuaded several former India captains to bring the board round.

 These ex-skippers had been part of a group of seven who were invited to the boards April 6-7 meeting and had recommended limiting the players to three product endorsements.

 Of the seven, at least three are clients of these same sports management firms that handle the cricketers sponsorship contracts.

 As board vice-president Rajiv Shukla announced in the evening that there could be a rethink on the endorsement cap, most sports management firms sounded relieved.

 We all have faith in the board and are waiting and watching. We are sure that eventually, the board will take a decision that will be acceptable to all, said Vinita Bangad, vice-president, Celebrity Management, Percept DMark, which handles accounts for Sourav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh.

 We are waiting for the BCCIs ruling in writing, which would come in a day or two. There will have to be a compromise, said Anirban Das Blah, vice-president, Globosport, which represents Zaheer Khan.

 This was in sharp contrast to the mood earlier in the day when the media managers were threatening to unite and sue the board against the endorsement cap, describing it as as an attack on their right to livelihood.

 We have already contacted sponsors like TCL, Puma and Sahara, who have agreed to unite and are talking to others, Shailendra Singh of Percept was quoted by PTI as saying.

 I think it (the cap) is not legally tenable. Its an attack on an individuals right to income. It affects both players and their media managers, said the head of a sports management company who did not wish to be named.

 But Ankur Chawla, a lawyer who has appeared for the board in court cases, said such an argument would not hold water since the right to livelihood is guaranteed by the state and not a private body. So, only a government can be sued over alleged denial of this right.

 Besides, no third party can file a case against the BCCI they (the media managers) are mere agents of the players, Chawla said.

 Latika Khaneja of Collage Sports Management, which handles Virender Sehwags interests, was acknowledging just this when she said, We cant do much about it until and unless the players themselves decide and come up to oppose the restrictions. I am sure, no player would take such a step at the cost of his cricketing career.

 But even if a player moves court claiming the terms in the contract are onerous or extremely unreasonable, he may not have a strong case, another legal expert said. The cricketer would have to prove that the endorsement cap is not aimed at improving or maintaining players performance.

 The BCCIs decision wasnt arbitrary. The players were involved in the entire process. So, I dont see the players filing any case against the board, Chawla said.

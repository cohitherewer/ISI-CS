 Spy eye on Monica

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhopal, July 14: Monica Bedis lawyer today called for a high-level probe after reports emerged that a closed-circuit television has been recording the actress in her Bhopal Central Jail barrack.

 I am writing to higher authorities, including the Supreme Court, the National Commission for Women and the National Human Rights Commission, to look into the matter. Its shocking and brazen, said P.C. Vedi.

 State jail minister Antar Singh Arya confirmed that a closed-circuit camera was monitoring Monica. But I have asked for its removal. He said the camera had been perhaps installed because of security considerations.

 But jail superintendent Purushottam Somkunwar has rubbished the report as false and baseless. He said there were no hidden cameras in the womens ward or in Monicas cell and bathroom.

 Vedi said he initially did not believe that a hidden camera had been placed, violating an inmates privacy, but became suspicious after the minister admitted it. An inquiry should be immediately ordered and the guilty should be punished if any violation of privacy has taken place.

 He said there were unconfirmed reports that the footage was being misused as MMS.

 Asked if Monica was aware of the camera, he said: I do not know. She was never informed about the specific location of the camera.

 Antiques law beef-up

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 4: The Centre is mulling tougher penalties to prevent antiques being smuggled out of the country.

 Culture minister Ambika Soni said in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha that the government was considering amendments to the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, 1972, to make the provisions more stringent with a view to curb illegal trafficking in antiquities.

 The culture ministrys proposals include higher punishments. At present, smuggling antiques can lead to imprisonment between six months and three years and a fine. The smuggler can also be charged under the Customs Act.

 The proposed amendment would make certain offences under the act non-bailable and bring in more restrictions, including one on making unauthorised replicas of antiques.

 As it exists now, the 1972 act amended in 1976 bans export of antiquities and art treasures by anyone other than the central government or an agency authorised by it.

 Selling an antique within India, too, requires a permit. The government has the power to enforce compulsory acquisition of an antique, depending on its heritage value.

 Under the act, an object has to be at least a century old to qualify as an antiquity and a manuscript needs to be over 75 years old. But an art treasure can be of more recent make.

 While many antiques are feared smuggled every year, Soni gave a list of those that have been traced abroad. The government has begun the process of claiming them back.

 These are five sculptures in Londons British Museum, a set of astronomical tools now in Egypt, a Thirthankar sculpture in Washington, a Nataraja sculpture in London and another of Varah in Switzerland.

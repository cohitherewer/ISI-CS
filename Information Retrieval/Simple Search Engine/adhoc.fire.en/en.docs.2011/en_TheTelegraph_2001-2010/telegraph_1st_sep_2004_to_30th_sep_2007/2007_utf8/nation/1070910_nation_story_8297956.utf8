 Gulf workers catch govt eye

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 New Delhi, Sept. 9: The abuse of Indian labour in the Gulf countries has become so serious that the government has summoned all heads of missions from the region to discuss the possibility of a minimum wage and stricter controls to protect the workers. 

 Overseas Indian affairs minister Vayalar Ravi and junior foreign minister E. Ahamed will lead a conference of Indian envoys to Syria, Lebanon and all the Gulf states Saudi Arabia, Oman, UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, Yemen and Kuwait in the capital over the next few days to discuss this issue. 

 I am especially concerned about the condition of Indian women who work in the Gulf, and want to introduce changes that will end their exploitation, Ravi told The Telegraph. 

 A proposal that is going to be debated is a minimum wage for the workers. One idea is to follow the Philippine model, which pegs the minimum wage for female domestic workers at $400 a month. 

 But many, including Ravi, feel that may not be feasible. The Filipinos are much more orderly people, he said. 

 Some envoys feel the introduction of a minimum wage might drive these countries to look for cheaper alternatives elsewhere especially Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. 

 Nearly five million Indians work in the Gulf the highest number of expatriates abroad and send home about $7 billion annually. Most workers are from the south Indian states and the prosperity of thousands of families, especially in Kerala, depends on their remittances. 

 According to one Indian ambassador in the Gulf, 40-45 per cent of these five million workers are unskilled and barely literate. They work as domestic help, gardeners, carpenters and porters. Because of the collusion between their foreign employer and unscrupulous recruiting agents in India, they are easily exploited. 

 According to Ravi, the visit visa is a trap the government needs to immediately do something about. Valid for two months, it is commonly used by agents to lure unsuspecting Indians to work in these countries. But the visa does not allow employment.

 As night falls across the Gulf, you will find at least two to three women who have escaped from homes where they are employed, hoping to find refuge in the Indian embassy, said the Gulf ambassador. 

 Ravi said he was planning to introduce revolutionary changes in the Immigration Act of 1983. Recruiting agents would be made more accountable and Indian embassy representatives would keep a watchful eye on employer and employee, he said. 

 The cabinet had last week cleared setting up an advisory body, the Overseas Employees Promotion Council, which would recommend procedures to be followed by state governments before workers are sent abroad, he said.

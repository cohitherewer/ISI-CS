The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Urban cash carpet

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 16: The department of urban development and municipal affairs has much to smile about. 

 The Bengal budget has put Rs 958.20 crore at its disposal to spruce up Calcutta and other towns, an incr- ease of 551 per cent over Rs 147.66 crore in the previous year.

 In his budget speech today, finance minister Asim Dasgupta also raised the outlay on municipal affairs from Rs 685.33 crore in the cur- rent year to Rs 800.11 crore in the next financial year (2007-08).

 We are very happy that the plan outlay has been increased more than substantially for the urban development and municipal affairs department. 

 A major reason for this is the focus on projects that are part of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, said Asok Bhattacharya, minister for urban development and municipal affairs.

 In all, Rs 2400 crore has been sanctioned under the mission, the amount meant to be distributed across projects in infrastructure development, housing for the poor, slum development and solid waste management.

 The increased funds will help us meet the shortfall after the Centres share comes in. Of the Rs 2,400 crore sanctioned, Rs 1,100 crore will be used for housing the urban poor and for slum development, he added.

 The central funding for projects under the mission varies from 30 per cent in Calcutta to 50 per cent in Asansol and Durgapur, and 80 per cent in other areas.

 The focus will be on solid waste management, sewerage, storm-water drainage and sanitation projects as part of the plans to strengthen urban infrastructure.

 Bhattacharya dismissed doubts that the 6 per cent rate of stamp duty could be a hurdle to getting money from Delhi. Central funding rules cap it at 5 per cent.

 Bengal is one of the few states which has such a low stamp duty. Elsewhere, it is as high as 8 to 12 per cent. However, this should pose no problems as the rate is already being brought down grad-ually in the seven-year period ending 2012, Bhattacharya said.

 A larger municipal affairs kitty will help build civic amenities in towns not covered by the mission, which only picks cities with a population of one to four million (2001 census). 

 Other cities qualify, but they are either state capitals or historic, cultural and tourist centres. 

 However, some new con- ditions in the mission are worrying. 

 One of them is the rule the finance minister referred to it in his speech that requires states to repeal the urban land ceiling act to get central funds.

 Nails in plane set off blame game

 Dubai (PTI): Four nails were found embedded in a tyre of an aircraft of Indian, minutes before it was to take off from Bahrain earlier this month. 

 The airlines engineers found the five-inch-long nails during a final check before departure, averting what an airline official described as a potential disaster, Bahrain-based newspaper Gulf Daily News said on Thursday.

 The flight was to take off for Doha en route to Kochi. It had been thoroughly checked after it arrived from Kochi, via Calicut and Doha, on January 2, sources said.

 An airline official said: We are conducting our own investigations but the onus lies on the authorities in Bahrain. 

 Civil aviation officials in Bahrain said there had been an incident with the aircraft, but the nails could have been picked up anywhere and not necessarily in Bahrain. The nails were small and harmless, and had perhaps fallen off someones suitcase while loading and unloading.

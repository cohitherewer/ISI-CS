 Ritual rap on AbAsh

 New Delhi, Feb. 11 (PTI): A US-based Hindu reform body has expressed concern at astrology-related and similar unscientific rituals performed by Amitabh Bachchans family to pave the way for son Abhishek to marry Aishwarya Rai (pictures above).

 In a statement from Michigan, Navya Shastra slammed the ceremonies the Bachchans and the Rais performed to ward off the evil Mars eye from Aishwarya. 

 Astrology and similar unscientific practices should be renounced in marital matchmaking and other everyday activities in Hindu society, said chairman Jaishree Gopal. What concerns us is that millions of people may rationalise their mistreatment of women based upon the Abhishek-Rai example.

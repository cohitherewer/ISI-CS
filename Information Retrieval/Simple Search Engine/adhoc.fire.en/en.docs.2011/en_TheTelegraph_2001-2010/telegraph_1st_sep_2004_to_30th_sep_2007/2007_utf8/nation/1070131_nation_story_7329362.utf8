 Big brother BJP angles for Shilpa

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Jan. 30: After Celebrity Big Brother, the BJP wants to get Shilpa Shetty on its show.

 Shilpa will soon join the BJP. I am not joking. Wait and see. We are in touch with her, three-time Gurdaspur MP Vinod Khanna told a news conference today. 

 Khanna said Shilpas popularity has soared after her victory in the UK reality TV show and he is certain she would become a part of the BJP. We are her big brothers now. We will bring her to the BJP. She will join us. She will be very happy to join. The next step for Shilpa is to join our party. I mean whatever I am saying. So many actors have joined the party after me. We are always looking for potential candidates and Shilpa is one of them and I am sure she will join us.

 Khanna said he had opted for the BJP as he wanted a more effective opposition to the Congress.

 Nobody trusted the Congress when I joined. It had become very corrupt, power-hungry and has not changed. If people like me join the party (BJP), it means we want to provide a healthy opposition to a party that is not for the common man. It is also the respect commanded by Atal Bihari Vajpayee that continues to draw film stars to the BJP.

 On his return to films, Khanna said: I have been spending from my savings since the last seven years. I have two children to look after. But that does not mean I will neglect my constituency. I have learnt what life is about from them. I will never leave them in the lurch. But I will now have to take out time for acting and for my family.

 Job scare looms for UK junior doctors

 London, March 20 (PTI): About 9,000 junior doctors in the UK may discover they have no jobs to go to this summer, health secretary Patricia Hewitt has said.

 For the first time, Hewitt confirmed in the House of Commons last night, 32,000 young doctors had applied for just 23,000 training posts.

 The chaos began when a new system for educating doctors, introduced by ministers, had too many medics going into training at the same time. 

 Then a computer glitch a few weeks ago meant the best young doctors were not being shortlisted for the top national health service jobs.

 The situation forced ministers to order an urgent review into what went wrong and a report is expected to be published later this week.

 The report is likely to advise hospitals to hunt down the best applicants who slipped through the net and invite them for late interviews.

 On Saturday, the anger of junior doctors peaked when more than 5,000 marched through the streets of London in their white coats and theatre scrubs in protest.

 Shadow health secretary Andrew Lansley said: Patricia Hewitts statement offers no consolation to the thousands of junior doctors who have been let down. She failed to apologise and failed to answer key questions.

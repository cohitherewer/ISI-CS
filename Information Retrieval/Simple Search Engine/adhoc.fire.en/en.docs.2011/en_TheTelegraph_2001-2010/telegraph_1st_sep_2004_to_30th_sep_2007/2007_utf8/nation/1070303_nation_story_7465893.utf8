 Graft list on House table

 - Eight generals and nine brigadiers among corrupt officers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 2: Eight generals and nine brigadiers have been named in a list of 25 armed forces officers facing charges of corruption. 

 Defence minister A.K. Antony has given the information in a written reply to the Lok Sabha. A lieutenant general indicted for irregularities in procurement of dry rations is likely to be the first officer with such a senior rank to face disciplinary action.

 The list updates a similar compilation tabled in Parliament in November. That list named 21 armed forces officers among whom were six generals. The two lieutenant generals named in the November list S.K. Sahni and S.K. Dahiya figure in todays list too.

 The defence minister said government orders in consultation with the Central Vigilance Commission to get all procurement decisions worth Rs 75 crore and above vetted by the comptroller and auditor general were being implemented. 

 Whenever government has apprehensions about a particular case, it is promptly referred to the Central Bureau of Investigation, the defence ministry release said.

 Lt Gen. Sahni (now retired) had appealed against action against him in Delhi High Court. The defence ministry release says his petition has been disposed of and a direction has been given to take disciplinary action as per due process of law. 

 The action could involve cashiering (stripping of rank and benefits), imprisonment and/or fine.

 The other lieutenant general Dahiya has been indicted for irregularities in operation of frozen meat contracts. The Northern Command chief has awarded recordable censure to the general officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Gandhi NRI hope

 AMIT ROY 

 London, July 15: A collection of articles written by M.K. Gandhi for Young India in 1921 plus a bundle of his letters which fetched 45,600 at Sothebys auction house in London last week will not be lost to India after all. 

 After the auction on July 12, Sothebys had said that Lot 17, the Gandhi documents, with a reserve price of between 25,000 and 35,000, had gone to a private buyer. 

 Asked whether the buyer was Indian, the Sothebys spokesman repeated: It went to a private buyer. 

 However, a reliable source told The Telegraph today: The buyer is an NRI who will gift the documents to India. 

 It is understood that he was encouraged to enter the bidding by India House. 

 The sale of Gandhis documents, which was held at Sothebys New Bond Street sale room, was part of a general auction under the English Literature amp; History category, which raised a total of 1,201,644. 

 Before the auction, Sothebys had said in its catalogue: Autograph manuscripts by Gandhi rarely appear at auction.

 This is not strictly true. At Christies, Gandhis articles for Urdu Harijan were recently withdrawn from auction after the intervention of diplomats from India House. 

 These documents are due to be transferred to the external affairs ministry in Delhi. 

 Sothebys itself had an auction in 1998 of 18 letters written by Gandhi between 1918-24 to Maulana Abdul Bari, the founder of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind. They fetched 21,172.

 Businessman Sir Gulam Noon confirmed today: I bought them jointly with Nat Puri (another UK-based businessman) and they were handed over to President Narayanan in early 1999. 

 Noon, who is in the Indian food business and is known for his philanthropy, added: Five years previously, I bought another set of Gandhi documents with (Lord Raj) Bagri (former chairman of the London Metal Exchange) for about 14,000. 

 The buyer this time has not yet come forward. 

 It is quite clear that Gandhis articles for Young India have considerable historical significance. 

 Sothebys has pointed out: These articles were printed together in April 1921 in Young India. Gandhi was the general editor of this weekly journal and many of his writings appeared there, including the three inflammatory articles which led to his conviction for sedition in 1922.

 That the auction at Sothebys went ahead corrects a serious misapprehension in India. 

 The copyright for all letters written by Mahatma Gandhi rests with the Navajivan Trust in Ahmedabad at least, that is what the trust believes. It is also of the opinion that while recipients of letters from the Mahatma have the right of ownership over them, the copyright for all such letters rests with the trust. 

 Under the terms of Gandhis will, it asserts, the copyright for all his written works, published and unpublished, went to the trust that he founded. This means that owners of letters or anything else written by Gandhi cannot reproduce them for monetary benefit. 

 Sothebys has now demonstrated that the opinion of the trust would not necessarily be shared by auction houses or by the courts in the West. 

 However, Sothebys would not want to fall out with activists in India over the Gandhi papers, which constitute a very small part of its business.

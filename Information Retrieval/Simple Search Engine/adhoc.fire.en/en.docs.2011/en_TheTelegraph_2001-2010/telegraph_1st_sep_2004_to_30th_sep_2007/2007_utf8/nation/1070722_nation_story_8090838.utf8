 Srinagar, July 21: Thirteen Amarnath pilgrims, including two from Bengal, were wounded when a suspected militant lobbed a grenade at a community kitchen in Pahalgam today.

 Officials said the attack, the second in less than a week, triggered panic at the pilgrimage base camp in Anantnag district but failed to disrupt the annual journey to the cave shrine.

 Pahalgam station house officer Mohammad Shafi said an unidentified militant threw the grenade at a local gurdwara around 1.15 this afternoon when the pilgrims were having lunch at the makeshift kitchen.

 Thirteen pilgrims were injured and were taken to an Anantnag hospital for treatment where seven were referred to SMHS Hospital in Srinagar (about 100km away), Shafi said.

 Madan Mantoo, a spokesperson for the Amarnath shrine board, said eight of the injured were sadhus.

 Among the wounded are Pranab Karmokath and Mahakal, from Siliguri and Calcutta, respectively. Police sources said they are being treated at the Anantnag hospital and are out of danger. 

 The other injured pilgrims are from Jammu, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. 

 No militant group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

 Earlier this week, on July 17, a Kashmiri labourer was killed and 17 people were injured when suspected militants attacked a crowded camp in Baltal, another pilgrimage base camp, east of Srinagar.

 A police officer said todays blast triggered panic in Pahalgam. Many pilgrims were screaming and running, he said. 

 But Mantoo said the attack didnt deter other pilgrims. The yatra is on as more pilgrims are on their way to Pahalgam from Jammu for the onward journey to the holy cave, he said.

 So far 1.54 lakh pilgrims have visited the cave since the yatra resumed officially on July 1. Around 1,500 left for the cave today from the Baltal route and another 1,000 from Pahalgam.

 Around 4.5 lakh pilgrims visited the shrine last year.

 Thousands of pilgrims trek through treacherous mountain passes to the cave, where devotees worship a phallus-shaped ice stalagmite seen as a symbol of Lord Shiva.

 However, the holy lingam melted even before the yatra started this year.

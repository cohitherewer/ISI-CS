 BJP chants Bapu 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: The BJP needs the Mahatma for Ram.

 The party today announced a nationwide agitation on October 2, the Mahatmas birth anniversary, to protest the alleged insult of Lord Ram by the Congress and the DMK 

 Slogans like Jo Ram Ka Nahi, Woh Kam Ka Nahi (One who does not worship Ram is of no good) havent proved enough to bolster the partys Ram Setu campaign. So, this Gandhi Jayanti, the party has planned dharnas in district headquarters across India to send three messages. 

 One, that the UPA government has questioned Rams existence in the Supreme Court affidavit filed on the setu. Two, M. Karunanidhi has insulted Ram by referring to his drinking habits. Three, the DMK has resorted to violence against the BJP and other saffron organisations.

 The BJP will tell people that the Father of the Nation revered Ram and the party (the Congress) that swears by his name hasnt condemned those who insult the Hindu icon. 

 For the Sangh parivar, which has lived with the ignomi ny of being linked to the Mahatmas assassination, October 2 has been an insignificant date. But the BJP has managed to insulate itself from the charges. Having used other methods to connect with Gandhi earlier, the BJP believes the Ram Setu controversy can become the long-desired bridge to the Mahatma.

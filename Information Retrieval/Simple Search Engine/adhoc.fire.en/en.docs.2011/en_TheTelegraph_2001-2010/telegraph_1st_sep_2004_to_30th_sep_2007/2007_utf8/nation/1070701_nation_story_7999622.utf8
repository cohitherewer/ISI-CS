 Couple dig own grave

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, June 30: Mohammed Hussein has again bought land after his sons snatched his four acres and drove him away.

 The plot is just a few feet long, but it will be roomy enough for him and his wife after their death. The blinded, paralysed and leprosy-stricken 60-year-old has paid local clerics in advance to dig the graves.

 He has also bought 14 metres of white cloth for their funerals, said Basheeruddin, a priest at the mosque in Kondapur village, 65km northwest of Hyderabad.

 Hussein has handed the old-age pension of Rs 200 he received last month and a list of close friends to the clerics for the funeral meals.

 Some of his friends had offered to take up the responsibility but Hussein refused. Its true we cannot afford a grander burial than this, but we do not wish to lose a seat in Allahs court, he told them.

 Hussein used to be a wrestler in his youth till a head injury in the ring blinded him and paralysed his left leg. He also owned a meat shop that did brisk business, selling 50kg a day.

 But after he got his daughters married and handed his business over to his sons, the children took away his land, too. 

 They threw him and his wife Roshan Begum, 48, out of their home after Hussein contracted leprosy.

 Roshan now works in a farm as a daily wager to supplement the government pension her husband receives.

 Hussein says that after the IT boom in neighbouring Hyderabad raised land prices in their district, Medak, the sons decided to sell the land. But they needed his signature, which he wouldnt give them.

 After they failed to persuade me, they twice sent goons to kill me, Hussein alleges.

 Many elderly villagers call on him at his small hut every day and give him company for a few hours. Having made his preparations, Hussein has become livelier in the past few weeks, villagers say.

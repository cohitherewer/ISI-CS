 Narco tests

 Ahmedabad, May 4 (PTI): The three IPS officers arrested in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case have refused to take narco-analysis tests.

 The three accused officials, including DIG D.G. Vanzara, refused to undergo brain-mapping and other forensic tests when officials of CID (crime) approached them for their consent, a police source said tonight.

 The CID is likely to move court tomorrow for permission to conduct the tests, including narco-analysis in which a chemical is injected intravenously and confession is extracted while the accused is half asleep.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Pact packs ammo to disarm critics 

 Barring a tag, India has its way 

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: The sound and fury over selling out to the US on the nuclear deal seem to have collapsed in a whimper on the day the draft was released in Delhi and Washington.

 But neither the Left nor the BJP, which had virtually put the Manmohan Singh government on notice as it publicly opposed every step in the tortuous negotiation, had any significant criticism today, indicating that they were unable to find a worthy Brahmastra at first glance. 

 The 22-page text, put on the website of the external affairs ministry this morning, was a testimony to the governments self-confidence over the deal.

 According to the text, the pact will remain in force for 40 years till 2048 and for 10-year periods thereafter.

 Although the formal signing still remains, the availability of the text brings the curtains down on dramatic two-year-long negotiations, during which the government often appeared to be at war with the atomic energy department.

 The final product has incorporated most Indian demands, including the right to reprocess spent fuel, uninterrupted supply of fuel for Indias 14 safeguarded civilian reactors (and many more India hopes will be built) as well as a strategic fuel reserve.

 Most important, this deal is only about the civilian nuclear relationship between the two countries. The agreement completely omits any reference to Indias military programme, allowing it to carry on producing fissile material and making bombs from the eight nuclear reactors that are not open to international inspection.

 Possibly the only major compromise on Delhis part is that the text does not name India as a nuclear weapons state, preferring the much milder cooperation between two parties possessing advanced nuclear technology.

 But the text makes no mention of any test that India may want to carry out in the future. However, there is considerable, delicately worded language on the consequences of cessation of cooperation. This could be interpreted to suggest the US has conceded that India retains the right to carry out a nuclear test if it wishes to do so.

 Analysts said India had not seen any reason to test even once after the 1998 tests at Pokhran. However, the Left and the BJP had insisted India should not relinquish the right of a voluntary moratorium. 

 Briefing a BJP delegation last week, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee said if India, indeed, wanted to test, all it had to do was to give notice a year before and walk out of the agreement.

 However, if Delhi does test and the US stops fuel supplies, America has promised to convene, along with India, a group of friendly supplier countries, (including) Russia, France and the UK, to pursue such measures as would restore fuel supplies to India. China is absent from the list of friendly countries.

 The text almost warns against the invocation of the right to return clause, saying it will have profound implications on the relationship. It goes on to point to the negative consequences of termination on ongoing contracts and projects between the two countries.

 Still, consent to reprocess is in conjunction with Indias decision to establish a national reprocessing facility that will be additionally safeguarded by the International Atomic Energy Agency. 

 It was this offer of double safeguards the fuel for the nuclear reactors is safeguarded in the first place, and reprocessing it will attract the second set of safeguards surprisingly by the atomic energy department that cracked the nuclear impasse.

 SC leaves it to luminaries

 New Delhi, Aug. 3 (PTI): The Supreme Court today declined to give any directive that the proposed agreement on the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal must be approved by Parliament.

 It (nuclear deal) is not a minor but a serious matter and the country is not lacking in proper advice..., a bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said.

 We cannot give a direction that it has to be put before Parliament for approval, the court said while allowing senior advocate P.S. Mishra to withdraw a petition seeking the directive.

 The court said the government must have taken the advice of several scientists and disagreed with the petitioners that many suggestions were ignored. You can wait till the matter is raised before Parliament, the apex court told Mishra.

 There are luminaries like Prime Minister, minister of parliamentary affairs and Speaker to decide on it, the court said.

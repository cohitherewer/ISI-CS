 Barbs replace consensus bid 

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Chennai, June 12: Sensing defeat in the presidential polls, the BJP-NDA leadership has turned its ire on the Congress for avoiding a dialogue with the Opposition on a consensus candidate.

 BJP leaders met at former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees residence where tempers were high. BJP chief Rajnath Singh, Opposition leader L.K. Advani and others expressed dismay at the Congresss move to scout for a loyalist of Sonia Gandhi for the top post.

 After the meeting, Rajnath said Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat would be an Independent candidate.

 The NDA is meeting on June 18 in Delhi to firm up its presidential poll strategy. 

 Several NDA leaders recalled how Vajpayee had genuinely worked out a near-consensus during the 2002 presidential poll. 

 NDA feelers had sounded the Congress leadership about P.C. Alexander but when the party did not respond favourably, A.P.J. Abdul Kalams name was circulated, a senior BJP leader said today.

 Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav then accepted Kalams name and a broad consensus was reached. In 2002, the Left had opposed Kalams candidature and forced a contest by fielding Lakshmi Sahgal.

 Targeting the Congress, BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said: A lot of compromises and a lot of underhand agreements are taking place. These are not in the interest of the dignity of the top constitutional post of the country. He alleged that the Congress was searching for a loyalist. 

 We want a nation-loyalist to be the President of India, he said. BJP leaders said it was surprising that barring an appeal by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, nobody has sought the NDAs support.

 In Bhopal, NDA convener George Fernandes ruled out the possibility of a consensus. The prevailing circumstances do not indicate that a consensus on a presidential candidate could be arrived at, Fernandes said.

 BJP leaders their alliance does not have the numbers to beat the UPA said they are in touch with the third front, which will meet on June 18 to take a final view on the presidential poll.

 The eight-party alliance, which includes the ADMK, the Samajawadi Party and the Telugu Desam Party, is now a divided house on supporting Shekhawat. 

 Some constituents are reluctant to back Shekhawat, fearing that such a stand might not go down well with the minorities. 

 ADMK leader Jayalalithaa said in Chennai that no consensus has been reached on supporting Shekhawat. Contesting reports that she was working for such a consensus, she said her party was now part of a separate front.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Delhi prays, Saran flies

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: Pending a political decision, the foreign policy establishment is sticking to the nuclear deal timetable.

 The operationalisation of the deal is already underway with the Prime Ministers special envoy, Shyam Saran, continuing with his tour of key Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) countries. 

 All 45 members will have to reach a consensus on the nuclear deal for it to come into force.

 Saran is not being called back as of now, highly placed sources said. 

 On Saturday evening, he was on his way to Brazil and Argentina after having wrapped up talks in Germany.

 The foreign policy camp is hoping that the political leadership would somehow find a way out to salvage the deal. The (Left) charge that we have compromised Indias sovereign national interest is outrageous. Nobody is going to tell us what is an independent foreign policy because that credit belongs to Jawaharlal Nehru and the Indian National Congress, Anand Sharma, the minister of state for external affairs, told The Telegraph.

 The sources said unless there was a political amber sign, the foreign ministry and the atomic energy department were expected to jointly begin talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

 Its a question of national honour and sovereignty. For the last two years, India has been negotiating the deal with the US. The Prime Minister has taken care of every concern put forward by the Left. Are we saying now that all our negotiators, whether Anil Kakodkar (atomic energy chief) or Shiv Shankar Menon (foreign secretary) are anti-national? a source asked.

 Sharmas sense of outrage is a reflection of the intense anger within the foreign policy wing. 

 Foreign ministry sources said that until now, there was a strong sense of euphoria for having got the US to give India such good terms that would put Delhi on a par with China.

 Officials pointed out that China is preparing to mount a counter-strategy at the NSG and accused the Left parties of looking at Chinas interests rather than Indias.

 Till late tonight, Sonia Gandhi and Sharma had not made changes to their plans to travel to South Africa on August 21, where the Congress president is launching a Mahatma Gandhi lecture series. A final decision will depend on how events unfold in the next two days.

 However, some feel that the Prime Minister should have relied on a few politicians also to sell the deal within the country. 

 All the negotiators and advisers are bureaucrats. There was no attempt to send party secretaries or ministers as special envoys. The PMO and the Congress hardly ever talked about the deal. As a consequence, there is little ownership in the party over the deal, a source said.

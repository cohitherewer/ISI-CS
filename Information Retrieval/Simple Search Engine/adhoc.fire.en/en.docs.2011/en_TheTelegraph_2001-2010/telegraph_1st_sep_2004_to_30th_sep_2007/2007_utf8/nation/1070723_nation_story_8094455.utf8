 Bangalore, July 22 (PTI): Police have stumbled on a Rs 50-lakh racket involving the printing and distribution of pirated editions of international bestsellers, including J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter series.

 Inayath, the suspected kingpin of the racket, has been arrested. A search is on for his accomplice Babu, deputy commissioner of police (south) Alok Kumar said.

 A raid on a press and an adjacent godown had yielded books by Rowling, Salman Rushdie, Sidney Sheldon and Arundhati Roy as well as some published by the Harvard Business School, Kumar said. Books written by outgoing President A.P.J Abdul Kalam were part of the haul.

 Kumar said the gang reproduced the covers of the original editions with immaculate precision.

 The racket operated in Mumbai, Chennai, Pune and Calcutta, and even sold the pirated books abroad. The gang printed pornographic books, too.

 Laden confesses to boys murder

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 8: An arrested member of a kidnappers gang today confessed to have killed at least two boys last year in Nalanda district, neighbouring Patna, police said.

 Senior superintendent of police Kundan Krishnan said more cases of killing after kidnapping could be unearthed with the help of clues provided by 35-year-old Sirodhan Kumar alias Laden. Sirodhan was arrested yesterday.

 Sirodhan said he had shot dead one of his hostages, Manoj Kumar, from point-blank range, while he butchered Pravesh Kumar, kidnapped from Patna last year, and buried his body parts in a remote Nalanda village. 

 Family members have identified the boy from some of the body parts and clothes recovered from the site.

 Praveshs uncle Jaigir Mahto masterminded his kidnapping, but it was executed by a friend of Randhir, another boy kidnapped from Patna in December. The duo, arrested earlier, was taken to Nalanda along with the police team that went to look for hostages.

 We had earlier arrested three persons involved in kidnapping. On the basis of information provided by them, joint police teams of Patna and Nalanda combed the interiors of Nalanda and arrested Sirodhan, he added.

 Sirodhan told the police he was part of a gang that had around 35 members, including at least one woman. His brief was to keep the victims in Sandalpur village under Harnaut police station of Nalanda. If asked to kill by the other members (of the gang), I would do the needful, he was quoted as saying during interrogation.

 While two of his hostages managed to run away from his hideout, two were released after the payment of ransom, Sirodhan said. I set one boy free because I knew him. I killed only two boys. The order to kill someone was passed on to me over the mobile phone. 

 SSP Krishnan said he believed Sirodhan could offer information on nine cases of kidnapping for ransom, four of which concerned hostages taken away from Patna.

 Court rap

 Patna High Court today ticked off the Bihar government for its failure to recover 143 children and youths kidnapped during the past few years. 

 A division bench of Chief Justice J.N. Bhatt and Justice S.K. Sinha asked the authorities to track down the missing children within six weeks and submit a report to the court.

 The high court also sought the names of relatives of 44 children killed after being kidnapped during the past years so that compensation could be paid to them. 

 The judges also sought a report on the 581 women who have gone missing in the state during the past few years.

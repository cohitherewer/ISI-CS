 Salman scales wall, keeps shirt on

 Mumbai/Jodhpur, Aug. 31: Back from jail after a week, Salman Khan had to jump over a wall to get home. As did girlfriend Katrina Kaif.

 With hundreds of fans crowding the front gate of his Bandra home, Salman and Katrina chose to enter from the back, climbing on white plastic chairs and over the wall.

 Inside, the welcoming aroma of his favourite biryani wafted out of the kitchen. Today, we will have loads of mutton and party all night, his make-up man Raju said.

 Around lunchtime, Rajasthan High Court had granted the actor bail after he paid Rs 1 lakh as security and a bond of Rs 50,000. A nervous wait for the court order followed, and as the minutes ticked by, there was a scare the star might have to do with bhindi-roti the staple jail dinner for another night. 

 He had been in the Jodhpur jail since Saturday after being handed a five-year sentence for killing a chinkara. 

 The rule is that the order must reach by sunset or before the jail shuts, senior jail superintendent Ota Ram Rohin said. It had taken days for actor Sanjay Dutt to be freed after he was granted bail in the Bombay blasts case.

 But Salmans team did not disappoint, reaching with the order well in time. He flew out of Jodhpur on a chartered plane. 

 A two-hour flight brought him to Mumbai at 9pm, where he had to wait 15 minutes in the plane because the Prime Ministers convoy was in the vicinity. It was 9.50 when he was home.

 In no time, Salman was at the first-floor balcony waving at the cheering fans who caused a traffic snarl. But flanked by bodyguard Shera and Raju, he looked subdued and left some disappointed.

 I wish he had taken off his shirt, screamed 45-year-old Mumtaz, waiting since 6pm, and hoping for a repeat of April 2006 the last time he was in jail when he had flung his T-shirt at fans. But Salman, who was in a white shirt when he walked out of jail, a T-shirt at Mumbai airport and in a grey shirt in his balcony, did not oblige.

 The next hearing is on October 24.

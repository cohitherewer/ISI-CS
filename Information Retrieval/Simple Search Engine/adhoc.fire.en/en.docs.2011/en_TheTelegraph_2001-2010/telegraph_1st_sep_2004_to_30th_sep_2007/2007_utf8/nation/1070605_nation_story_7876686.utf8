 Congress stakes claim to President

 New Delhi, June 4: The UPAs presidential candidate will be a Congress nominee, the party decided today.

 The candidate for the Vice-Presidents post will also be from the central coalition, but not necessarily the Congress.

 The Congress Working Committee, the partys highest policy and decision-making body, took the decisions this evening. The CWC also authorised party president Sonia Gandhi to finalise the candidate for President and, if necessary, the Vice-President.

 CWC member M.L. Fotedar moved the resolution, which was endorsed by the others. It is clear and final. The next President will be from the Congress. In principle, it has been decided that the Vice-President will also be from the UPA, a senior member said.

 The CWC authorised the Congress president, as a matter of procedure, to take a decision on the Vice-President, should the need arise. But let me stress that this is only a procedural matter and no decision has yet been taken on which UPA constituent the Vice-President will be from.

 Although the discussion began and ended with a one-line resolution, nobody was willing to hazard a guess. Until yesterday, the general belief was that Shivraj Patil had a slight edge over the earlier favourites, Pranab Mukherjee and Sushil Kumar Shinde. Sources emphasised Mayavatis word would be crucial.

 Sonia is expected to get the process rolling after she and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh return from their foreign trips. Singh will be in Germany for the G-8 summit from June 6 to 8, while the Congress president is going to the Netherlands on June 8 on a two-day lecture tour.

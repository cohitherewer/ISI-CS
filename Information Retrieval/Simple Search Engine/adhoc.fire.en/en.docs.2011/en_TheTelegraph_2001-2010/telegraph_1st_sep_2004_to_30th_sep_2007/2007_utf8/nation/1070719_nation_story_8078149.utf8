 Lashkar massacre mind shot

 A woman comforts a man (in Reuters picture) wounded in a grenade attack in Srinagar. One person died and 17 others, including an Amarnath pilgrim, were wounded in the attack on a camp of devotees at Baltal in Ganderbal district on Tuesday night. 

Police said the grenade exploded at the main gate. Many of the injured were stall owners. One of them, Abdul Rahim Lone, succumbed to his injuries in the morning.

 Srinagar, July 18: A Lashkar-e-Toiba top gun who coordinated operations across the country and staged mass killings in Jammu last year was shot dead this morning.

 Khalidur Rahman alias Abu Umar was felled in a joint operation by the army and police at Bhaderwah, 200km from Jammu. Police said he was involved in a foiled assassination attempt on chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad.

 A woman, Misra Begum, also lost her life in the 30-minute shootout. The police claim she was killed by Rahman when she refused to give him shelter in her house. 

 According to Singh, Rahman threw a grenade that killed the woman. But the police version could not be verified, raising the possibility that she may have been used as a human shield.

 Rahman was involved in the Kulhind and Basantgarh massacres of last year in which 19 and 13 people had been killed. He was also involved in the assassination attempt on the chief minister at Ramban recently, said Doda senior superintendent of police Manohar Singh.

 Rahman, a resident of Rawalpora in Pakistan, had been on the prowl in Jammu and Kashmir for the past 10 years. 

 In the past eight years, he launched fidayeen (suicide) attacks on security camps. He shifted to Doda two years ago and executed many operations there, Singh said. 

 Apart from recruiting youths, Rahman plotted ways in which militants could sneak in through the sea. 

 The lid on one such attempt was blown recently in Gujarat, where two arrested members of a fidayeen squad disclosed that Rahman had mapped out their high-sea route to India. 

 Jammu police chief S. P. Vaid said Rahmans death was a blow to the Lashkar. An officer said they had received inputs from intelligence agencies about his movements. 

 We were tracking his movements. On Tuesday, we learnt that he entered a house on the outskirts of Bhaderwah. Around 3.30am, the house was cordoned off. Rahman was killed in the exchange of fire, he said. An army jawan was injured in the gun battle, sources said.

 Rahman, who raised funds for the Lashkar in Kashmir, was also behind the murder of a deputy superintendent of police, Shelly Singh, a few months back, the officer said.

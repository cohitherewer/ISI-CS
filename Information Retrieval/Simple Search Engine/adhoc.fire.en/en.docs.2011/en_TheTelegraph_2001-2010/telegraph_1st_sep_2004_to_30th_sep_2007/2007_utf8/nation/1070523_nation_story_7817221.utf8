 Advanis sharper jab

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, May 22: L.K. Advani is a formidable political opponent at the best of times. But he seems to have become even more effective of late with his successor Rajnath Singh reeling from the partys poor performance in Uttar Pradesh.

 Take, for example, the ease with which Advani today converted a political event like the UPA completing three years into an exhibition of his superior skills.

 The BJP president held a news conference to launch an all-round attack on the UPA. He droned on about its pathetic performance on all fronts and released a 66-page booklet awkwardly titled UPAs Three Years; Aam Aadmis Tear Years.

 This is an anti-people, anti-poor, anti-farmer and anti-aam aadmi government. The UPA has weakened national security, food security and the countrys nuclear sovereignty. After three years, it is clear that they are incapable of running a government, Rajnath said.

 After an exhaustive account of the BJPs view of the UPAs three years, there was hardly scope for anyone to say anything. But Advani clearly thought otherwise. Barely two hours after Rajnath had finished, Advani issued a statement on the same subject all the way from Goa.

 Needless to say, the veteran managed to convey in a short statement what Rajnath could not in 66 pages.

 For the first time in our republican history, here is a government that is headed by a non-Prime Minister, run by a person who is not accountable to Parliament, and is surviving on life-support system provided by parties that behave more like the Opposition, the BJP leader said.

 Advani cited the Lefts conduct in Parliament during the budget session when its MPs joined the NDA in staging a walk-out in protest against the finance ministers reply to the budget.

 Advani then quoted Mani Shankar Aiyar to prove that the UPA is no more the aam aadmis government.

 On Sunday, the Union minister had warned the Congress-led coalition that it may not get the common mans endorsement if it did not correct its economic policy.

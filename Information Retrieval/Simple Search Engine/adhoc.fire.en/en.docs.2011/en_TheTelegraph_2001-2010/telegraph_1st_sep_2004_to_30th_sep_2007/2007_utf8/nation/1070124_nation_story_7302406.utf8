 Seat rejig fury at BJP

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Khandelwal

 Bhopal, Jan. 23: Vijay Khandelwal is an angry man these days.

 The BJP MP from Betul has reasons to be annoyed in its draft proposal, the delimitation commission has reserved his parliamentary seat for scheduled tribes from the next Lok Sabha polls.

 Khandelwal is also angry because in neighbouring Chhindwara, Union commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath is unaffected by the commissions exercise.

 Perhaps Chhindwara has more tribal population, but what has clinched the issue is the (BJP-led) state governments indifferent attitude to protecting the turf of party MPs.

 At a recent party meeting, Khandelwal was heard yelling at the top leaders. He said if the party needed money to field the best available legal counsel to challenge the proposal, he was prepared to bear part of the expenses.

 But please do something instead of remaining mute spectators, he told Madhya Pradesh BJP chief Narendra Singh Tomar.

 Tomar said he would consult senior leaders like Arun Jaitley.

 Khandelwal has found support both within and outside the party. For once, the Bhartiya Janshakti Party, which Uma Bharti floated after her expulsion from the BJP, is sympathising with Khandelwal.

 BJP general secretary Prahlad Patel, who had contested against Kamal Nath in 2004, said the BJP went before the commission without doing any homework. So, it has been a loser in a state where it has 25 out of 29 MPs.

 Delimitation or redrawing of constituencies is a thorny issue and is done by a high-power body whose orders cannot be questioned in a court.

 Headed by retired Supreme Court judge Kuldeep Singh, the commission has redrawn some of the reserved constituencies as general while several general constituencies will become reserved for SC/STs.

 In each state, including Madhya Pradesh, the commission has held public hearings of party representatives and the government before preparing the draft proposal. Khandelwal may have an outside chance to reverse the proposal if the BJP can present a strong and valid argument before the commission.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Man left to die at station

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, July 7: A 45-year-old man, suffering from chest pain, died at a packed railway station this morning after he was left unattended for over half an hour.

 According to witnesses, Pradip Banerjee was waiting for a train at Barasat station around 8.45 am. He was on his way to work at Bidhan Sishu Hospital in Calcuttas Phoolbagan.

 When he felt a pain on the left side of his chest and collapsed on the platform, some people reluctantly carried him to a concrete bench, said Amrita Gyen, a hawker. 

 While Banerjee lay unconscious, a crowd gathered around him but no one bothered to arrange for his treatment, he added. 

 After more than 30 minutes, Krishnamohan Kundu, a paper vendor, saw Banerjee lying on the bench and informed the Citu-affiliated hawkers union office on another platform. 

 They immediately accompanied me to the spot. But he had died by then, Kundu said.

 The incident brought Bengals cold face to the fore again. Last month, a Calcutta crowd had ignored a models cries for help as she was being molested on a busy street.

 Barasat station master P. Lakhra, however, denied railway employees had been negligent. By the time we sent our railway doctor to Banerjee and arranged to shift him, he had expired. We also informed the government railway police, he said.

 GRP officials said they had registered a case of unnatural death and sent the body for post-mortem.

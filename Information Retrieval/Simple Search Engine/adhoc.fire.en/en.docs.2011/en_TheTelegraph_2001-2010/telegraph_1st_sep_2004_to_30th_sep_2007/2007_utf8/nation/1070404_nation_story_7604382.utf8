 New Delhi, April 3: Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz today dramatically raised the stakes of the ongoing peace process with India by re-injecting Kashmir into the developing story.

 From the Pakistani perspective, the key dispute is Kashmir, which we would like to settle in accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people, Aziz said at a press conference on the sidelines of the Saarc summit. 

 He did not say who represented Kashmiri people, only adding that this could be a subject worthy of long discussion and debate.

 Asked what his country felt about Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs intent to travel to Pakistan only if there was a substantive outcome, Aziz said Pakistan was ready to receive him whenever it was mutually convenient and agreeable.

 Aziz had been careful not to raise the K word in his formal speech during the summit inaugural, only saying there was a direct co-relation between security and development. But at the news conference later, he seemed happy to let down his guard and link Kashmir to trade with India, and indirectly, even to terrorism.

 Aziz began by pointing out that both countries should focus less on process and more on the end result, that bilateral disputes such as Kashmir were now being openly discussed and that dispute resolution should be the cornerstone of bilateral discussions.

 He said while substantive efforts, such as people-to-people interaction, security and economic issues were being discussed, Pakistan felt that Kashmir is a core issue. Sometimes, people dont like us to say that, but this is a reality, Aziz said.

 A question on trade and travel yielded a similar answer. Travel is happening, there are improved and enhanced flights(but) trade is linked to progress on Kashmir, weve always said that.

 Aziz mentioned Safta, or the Saarc free-trade area, but said it could work only if both countries subsumed bilateral trading differences. Then, the K word was back again. There is a linkage between dispute resolution and bilateral relations, he said. 

 Aziz answered questions on Pakistans internal developments and on terrorism, which he felt had a number of root causes, including deprivation. Asked if Pakistan felt that one of the causes of terrorism, in the bilateral context, was Kashmir, Aziz this time refrained from giving a direct answer. The lack of dispute resolution may be one cause of deprivation.

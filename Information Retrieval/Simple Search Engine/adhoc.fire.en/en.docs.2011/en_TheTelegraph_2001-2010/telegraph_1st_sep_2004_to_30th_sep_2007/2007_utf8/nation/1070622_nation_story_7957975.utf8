 US visa

 Washington, June 21 (PTI): The US has extended for six months suspension of the premium processing service for those seeking work under the religious visa or the R-1 classification.

 The service, which helps businesses obtain faster processing of petitions and applications, was suspended last November for six months.

 Premium processing for the R-1 visa will begin only on December 18, 2007, the US citizenship and immigration service said.

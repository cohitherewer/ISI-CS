 SEZ ball lobbed to panel court

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Kamal Nath

 New Delhi, Jan. 19: Commerce minister Kamal Nath has left it to the empowered group of ministers to differentiate between special economic zones (SEZ) where land acquisition is a problem and those where it isnt. The committees next meeting is slated for Monday.

 I am also aware of certain concerns over land acquisition and the hardship it causes to farmers. I had written to chief ministers to acquire waste or barren land and, if necessary, single-crop land for SEZs, Nath said today.

 In the first 150 cases approved, the entire land was with state industrial corporations or with companies, he said, adding that not a single farmer had been displaced. 

 Nath made it clear that Mondays meeting will not consider limiting the number of SEZs in a particular sector, saying the issue had been settled in the previous meeting. 

 It was decided in the groups last meeting that the issue of sector-wise caps would be examined after 100 SEZs are notified. Only 62 have been notified so far, he said.

 Nath stressed that special economic zones boost exports and generation of employment, besides creating world-class infrastructure and attracting foreign investment.

 The minister sought to play down the directive from the Prime Ministers Office, which said a relief and rehabilitation policy must precede any further land acquisition for SEZ. Rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, who is on the ministerial panel, will draft the policy.

 It will take about two months to finalise the package. The cabinet will approve it and give the policy statutory force so that it becomes mandatory for states, a rural development ministry official said, adding no land will be acquired till the policy is in place. 

 The board of approval for SEZs has given final clearances to 237 projects and in-principle approvals to another 160. Over half of these ventures are in the IT sector.

 New approvals havent come through since October, and the board has postponed its meetings twice this month.

 Mondays meeting of the ministers is the first since August, when they had removed the cap of 150 on the number of SEZs. They decided to review the situation after five months or when 75 SEZs get going, whichever is earlier.

 The land backlash at Nandigram and Singur has added an element of urgency to the relief policy. Another trigger has been the forthcoming state elections, in which the Congress doesnt want to be seen as going against farmers.

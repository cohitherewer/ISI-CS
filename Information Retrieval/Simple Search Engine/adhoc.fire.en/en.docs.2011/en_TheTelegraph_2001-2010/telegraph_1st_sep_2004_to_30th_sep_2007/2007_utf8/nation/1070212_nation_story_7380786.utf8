 Rap on pretender degrees

 New Delhi, Feb. 11 (PTI): In an order that would deter private institutes from misleading students by claiming their courses are on a par with degree courses, the state consumer commission has asked an aircraft engineering institute to refund the fees of two candidates.

 There is nothing like on a par or similar. Either it is a degree course or it is not. To assign such status to any course is highly misleading and unfair, the commission headed by Justice J.D. Kapoor said.

 Meeta Sengupta, a resident of Ashram here, had sought refund of the fees for her two daughters who were misled into taking admission in a B.Tech degree course at the Indian Institute of Aircraft Engineering based at Mahipalpur, which was later found not duly recognised as a degree course.

 After the south-west district consumer forum held in August last year that the institute was guilty of deficiency in service and asked it to refund the fees, it went to the state consumer commission, which dismissed the appeal, holding such a practice amounts to unfair trade practice, too.

 Directing the institute to refund to the complainant Rs 1.42 lakh taken for admission in a course which was later found to be on a par with a bachelors degree in aeronautical engineering, Justice Kapoor said a mere mentioning of the claim in the prospectus is self-defeating and squarely comes within the mischief of unfair trade practice.

 Expressing concern on the dilemma and hardship being faced by students who enrol in courses think- ing they are on a par with a particular course, Justice Kapoor observed: This practice is detrimental to the future prospects of candidates as they expect a status similar to those passing out with recognised degree courses.

 Such types of advertisements are nothing short of unfair trade practice and a sort of exploitation of the aspiring candidates, Justice Kapoor said, dismissing the appeal.

 Refusing to buy the institutes argument that the course in question was patronised by Jawaharlal Nehru and recognised by the Union Public Service Commission and the IIT, the judge said no government authority can issue any such notification for any private institute saying the course in question is on a par with a degree course.

 Hope gives way to anger

 Haneefs brother Shoaib

 Bangalore, July 14: Last night, Firdous Arshiya was excitedly anticipating a meeting with husband Mohammed Haneef sometime next week, and imagining his delight at his first sight of their baby daughter.

 This morning, she was close to tears. The grounds on which he has been charged are totally baseless and unfair. Everybody knows he is innocent, she told reporters at her fathers home in BTM Layout. I was expecting them to release him.

 At the third-floor flat where Haneefs mother and brother live, preparations to welcome him home had ground to a sudden halt. The apartment had its doors shut and curtains drawn as reporters and broadcast vans gathered outside the building.

 The family had switched off the calling bell. The usually soft-spoken Shoaib, Haneefs younger brother, replied with a gruff no comments to every reporter who called.

 Firdous was more vocal. The police knew about the SIM card from day one. Why did they wait for 12 days? she asked.

 The SIM card had a two-year validity and since Haneef had used it for only a year, he had given it to his cousin Sabeel Ahmed, a fellow doctor, she claimed.

 Was there anything wrong in him communicating with his cousins (Sabeel and Kafeel Ahmed)? she said. They used to discuss the medical practices in the two countries and compare them.

 Firdous appealed to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and defence minister A.K. Antony to help her out. She said the family was thinking of hiring a lawyer for Haneef.

 Asked if she might fly to Australia, she said she would speak with Haneefs lawyer Peter Russo first. We are trying to contact him (Russo) but have not been able to, she said.

 Ahmeds silent

 The Ahmed family refused to speak about Sabeel being charged. Sorry, we cant react, a relative said.

 Sabeel is the first Indian to be accused with a serious terrorist offence in Britain if one excludes Udham Singh, who shot dead Sir Michael Dwyer in London on March 13, 1940, as retaliation for Jallianwala Bagh.

 The Ahmeds lawyer, B.T. Venkatesh, said: We do not know what the details of the charges are. He added that the British authorities were required to supply all information relating to the charges to Sabeels counsel.

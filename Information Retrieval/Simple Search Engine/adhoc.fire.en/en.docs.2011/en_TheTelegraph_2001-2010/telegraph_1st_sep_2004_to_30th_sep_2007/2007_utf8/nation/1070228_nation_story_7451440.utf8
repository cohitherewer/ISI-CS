 CAS fee blow to channels

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: The Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal today delivered a blow to leading television channels, dismissing their plea against a tariff order which says viewers in CAS areas will pay no more than Rs 5 a month for each channel they get.

 The tribunal dismissed the appeals filed by SET Discovery, Singapore-based ESPN-STAR Sports and ESPN Software India against the order issued by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) in August last year.

 It also dismissed their plea against another Trai order on how broadcasters and cable operators should share revenue in areas where CAS, or conditional access system, is implemented.

 The appellants now have the option of going to court.

 In the run-up to CAS implementation in specified areas in Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai last August, Trai had fixed Rs 5 plus taxes per month as the price households would pay for each channel they see. 

 Broadcasters had protested against the tariff ceiling, saying Trai had no business fixing prices. 

 Television was not an essential commodity, they said.

 The tribunal said in its order: Cable industry may not be an essential commodity in the sense that it is not an item of food without which one cannot survive. Yet, looking at the figures of TV viewership in this country, its importance cannot be underestimated.

 Television had almost attained the status of an essential service, it added.

 The three companies which went to the tribunal represent leading channels.

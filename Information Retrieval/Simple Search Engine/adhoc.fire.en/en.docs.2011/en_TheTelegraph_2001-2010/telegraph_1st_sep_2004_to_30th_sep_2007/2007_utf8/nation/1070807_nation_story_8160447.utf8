 New Delhi, Aug. 6: Runaway contractor Ashok Malhotra was today arrested by the CBI after he dramatically showed up at the studio of a private TV news channel.

 Alleged to be close to Delhi politicians and the kingpin of a multi-crore land scam, Malhotra landed at the Zee News studio from Agra this morning and offered to surrender live on TV.

 The CBI had raided his residence last week, accusing him of colluding with five Delhi Development Authority officials and acquiring plots meant for slum dwellers at throwaway prices. It also found a fleet of luxury cars with VIP number plates at his place as well as incriminating documents.

 The CBI, however, waited till Malhotra emerged from the studio to arrest him. He was then taken to the agency headquarters for questioning.

 Malhotra, missing for the past five days, claimed he had gone underground as he feared for his life. He alleged he was being framed and that he was not a political person.

 The scam has brought the rivalries between Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshits supporters and detractors into the open, but it is not clear yet how the land row is tied up with the luxury cars.

 Dikshit loyalists claimed Delhi ministers Arvinder Singh Lovely, Haroon Yusuf and A.K. Walia had hatched a plot to topple her and were using Malhotra to provide logistical support. He would give luxury cars to MLAs in exchange for their support to the plan.

 The trio today went to meet Sonia Gandhi but were assured that they would be granted an audience later as the Congress chief was not home. Agencies, however, reported that she did meet them.

 Malhotra denied reports that he had relations with Delhi politicians and had used them to secure the land contracts and run a canteen on the DDA premises. But he acknowledged that some leaders had helped him secure VIP car numbers. I have neither links with politics nor do I have any black money. I have a fascination for VIP car numbers.

 He claimed he had 17, not 52, cars as reported in the media and that his total assets were worth less than Rs 10 crore. He claimed the CBI assaulted his aged mother and servants during the raids last week.

 CBI director Vijay Shanker declined comment.

 Asked why the contractor was not arrested as soon as he reached the studio, Shanker said: I think everyone has a chance to tell his side of the story and I dont mind if he chose a television studio as his platform. The Delhi cabinet today decided to freeze registration of fancy numbers for cars, given only on the recommendation of ministers and MLAs, till the finalisation of a new policy.

 Aag puts out remake fire

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Calcutta, Aug. 31: More people were waiting for the remake of Sholay than for the first day, first show of Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag at Inox in the Forum mall here.

 Even more people were queuing up to catch the morning show of Heyy Babyy, which has entered its second week, on the next screen. 

 The lukewarm opening to the much-awaited Amitabh Bachchan-starrer has defied the logic behind Bollywoods remake rush get in maximum people in the first weekend with the known reference points. 

 The below 50 per cent advance bookings for Varmas unofficial remake of Sholay are the second blow to the remake rage after J.P. Duttas Umrao Jaan turned cropper last year. 

 Even Victoria No. 203, the other new release with Aag and another remake, had a very poor start at the turnstiles.

 Before Umrao Jaan, Bollywoods remake juggernaut was going great guns, with Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Devdas, Pradeep Sarkars Parineeta and Farhan Akhtars Don becoming blockbusters. 

 The idea of a remake, as we understand it, works in two ways. First, it is a tribute to a film you have loved watching and second, you are officially adapting an old film rather than just copying it, said Farhan, who bought the rights of the 1978 film from the original makers of Don.

 Both Bhansali and Sarkar, however, said their films were based on the original Sharatchandra Chattopadhyay novels than the popular celluloid versions by Bimal Roy.

But constant comparisons between Shah Rukh Khan and Dilip Kumar and between Meena Kumari and Vidya Balan meant that the audiences out there would always compare the new film with the old one.

 Not everyone will compare, said Varma. You will have all kinds of audiences coming in to watch Aag those who are fans of Sholay, those who are not that much into Sholay, those who havent seen Sholay. So there is always bound to be mixed reactions whenever a film is re-interpreted.

 But the key lies in how you reinterpret the film. Like Bhansali changed the very humble setting of Bimal Roys Devdas into a grandiose larger-than-life backdrop for his 2002 version and Farhan changed the plot points and characterisations for audiences to find new twists in a thriller like Don. 

 My Brother Nikhil director Onir, who is remaking Sai Paranjpes Chashme Buddoor, said: You have to modernise the film with nuances from the original so that a whole new generation can relate to the ethos in the content.

 The big dud in Aag can actually thwart people from producing remakes, trade analysts feel. 

 Mumbai-based film critic Indu Mirani said: It will surely come as a blow because remakes had become the easy formula in Bollywood. You just cant transport a film three decades later and not change any of the other settings or characters. Remake or not, a film has to be an entity on its own.

 While the Aag effect remains to be seen, there are already many movies on the remake bandwagon. Pritish Nandy Communications, after buying the official remake rights of Sholay from the Sippys, will make a new Sholay, a prequel, a sequel and even an animated version of the 1975 Ramesh Sippy classic. 

 Then there are two people making Devdas all over again. Anurag Kashyaps version is called Dev D while Sudhir Mishra is making Aur Devdas. And then Salman Khan and his brothers will be seen in a new Amar Akbar Anthony. 

 For Bollywood, the remake game has just begun.

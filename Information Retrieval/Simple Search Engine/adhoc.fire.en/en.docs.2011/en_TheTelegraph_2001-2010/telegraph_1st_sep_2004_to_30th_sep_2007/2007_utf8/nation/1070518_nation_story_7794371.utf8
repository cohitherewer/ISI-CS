 Amar promises Congress cushion for President

 Delhi, May 17: The stalemate in the presidential electoral college has been broken and the odds have started shifting in favour of the UPA-Left combine.

 The decisive thrust was provided by the Samajwadi Partys decision to abide by the Lefts choice even if the candidate belongs to the Congress.

 In the changed political situation, we will go with the decision of the Left parties, Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh said today.

 The statement spelt a reversal of Amars stand that his party would not go with the Left if it backed a Congress candidate.

 For the Congress, it was no less than a big relief. The electoral colleges fragmentation had become a cause of concern for the Congress.

 Sources traced the Samajwadi Partys change of heart to the growing realisation that after the Uttar Pradesh debacle, the party needed to cling to the Left and re-assert its anti-BJP posture.

 The shift in the partys stated position took place during two days of talks Mulayam Singh Yadav had with party leaders in the capital. After laying down the line on the presidential poll, the party chief left for Lucknow yesterday. 

 In the presidential electoral college of 10,98,882, the UPA and the Left together have 5,34,366 votes while the NDA has 3,64,242. The remaining 2,00,274 votes belong to parties and Independents not attached either to the UPA-Left or the NDA. The Samajwadi Partys vote value is nearly 59,671.

 With the party deciding to follow its Left friends, the UPA-Left combines strength rises to 5,94,037 more than the halfway mark of 5,49,441.

 Samajwadi Party sources said the BJP had approached Amar yesterday for support to its candidate. But several Samajwadi Party leaders were of the opinion that going with the NDA would be suicidal.

 Amar, however, did not forget to express his unhappiness with the Congress, accusing it of playing politics of animosity and enmity.

 The Samajwadi Partys change of stand took away the element of desperation that was compelling the Congress to intensify its bid to woo BSP leader Mayavati sooner than later. Mayavatis party has a vote value of nearly 60,000.

 Simultaneously, it has also weakened the BJP-led NDAs bid to force a contest. The Samajwadi Partys decision to put its flock behind the Congress-Left combine could lend momentum to a bid to find a consensus candidate.

 But the Congress is miffed with the Left parties for jumping the gun and going virtually public with the name of Pranab Mukherjee as their candidate for President.

 Party sources said even before the Congress took a collective view, the Left leaders, for reasons best known to them, had leaked Mukherjees name. We have not decided on any name, a Congress source said.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi have held broad consultations but the Congress leadership has yet to take the final decision.

 Although the Samajwadi Party has promised its votes, the Congress is not taking any chances. Mayavatis chief political aide, Satish C. Mishra, was in the capital today and he reportedly met Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel.

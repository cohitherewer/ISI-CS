 Sarabjit kin to tap global court

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, July 29: Mohammed Haneefs freedom has given hope to the family of Sarabjit Singh, an Indian death-row convict in Pakistan.

 Sarabjits family is planning to approach the UN-run International Court of Justice.

 When there is no one to listen to our plight in India, it is better to approach an international court. We are in touch with human rights organisations worldwide and hope to secure Sarabjits release, sister Dalbir said from the familys Bhikhiwind home, near Amritsar.

 The family last saw Sarabjit on August 28, 1990, before he crossed the border, apparently in an inebriated state. 

 He was later charged with engineering blasts in various cities of Pakistan given the death sentence. 

 But Dalbir claims her brother is innocent, like Haneef.

 The family offered thanks-giving prayers today for Haneefs release but Dalbir found it strange that the government had thrown its weight behind the man initially suspected of having links to the UK terror plots. Neither the Prime Minister nor any other minister has appealed to President Pervez Musharraf or any other authority seeking Sarabjits release, she said.

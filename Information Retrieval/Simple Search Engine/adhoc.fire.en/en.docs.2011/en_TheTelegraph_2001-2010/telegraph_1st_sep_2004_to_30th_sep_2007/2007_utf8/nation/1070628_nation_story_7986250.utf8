 Reforms 3 supporters

 New Delhi, June 27: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said there were only three supporters within the Congress when he launched the economic reforms in the early nineties.

 One of the supporters was Mani Shankar Aiyar, Singh said, pointing to his colleague seated in the audience at a book release, reports PTI. 

 He said the Congress had differences. But times have changed. Good results are for everyone to see.

 What Singh didnt say but probably was on his mind was Aiyar, too, has changed. The minister had said in April that I was always something of a Leftist but I became a complete Marxist only after the economic reforms.

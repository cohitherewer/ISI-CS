 Gujjar wrath hits Gurgaon 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 4: Gujjar fury singed Gurgaon today, leaving the IT hub crippled.

 Showing solidarity with members of their community who are fighting for Scheduled Tribe status in Rajasthan, the Gujjars of Gurgaon blocked the main road that leads to the Haryana satellite city through the day.

 The Mehrauli-Gurgaon road is a lifeline for thousands who travel to and from Delhi everyday. 

 BPO offices, high-end residential complexes and swanky malls may be the hallmark of Gurgaon. But the citys fringes, which have a large Gujjar population, came to the forefront today.

 National Highway 8 was the only link to the capital that remained open. Many with their own vehicles took the longer detour, but it was of no help to those depending on public transport. 

 Manmeet, 24, had started from Mehrauli for his office, Patni Computers in Gurgaon, around 9 in the morning. He was stranded till 12.30. 

 Manmeet said the bus he had boarded was diverted towards Aya Nagar, one of the worst-affected areas. Passengers were told to get off, while the Gujjars were clashing with the police outside. 

 Manmeet hid behind a kiosk for hours till temporary calm was restored. By that time, he had decided to take the day off.

 Near Ghitorni, another stretch on the Mehrauli-Gurgaon road, Gujjar protesters uprooted boards erected by the Delhi Metro Corporation for the construction of a new line to Gurgaon. They used the boards as barricades to stop traffic. 

 There were several like Manmeet who were forced to skip work today, while the rest reached office late. 

 BPO offices admitted a dip in attendance, but said work was not affected much as the peak hours are at night.

 Hearing loss scare in cell use

 At risk? 

 Chandigarh/New Delhi, Aug. 9: Long-term mobile phone users appear to have a greater risk of hearing loss than people who have never used cellphones, says a study by Indian doctors to be presented at an American medical conference. 

 The study by doctors at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, suggests that people who have used mobile phones for more than four years and for longer than 30 minutes a day are at risk of developing hearing loss. 

 This is only a preliminary study the first in India, and it has thrown up results that point to a need for a larger study, said Naresh Panda, the head of the otolaryngology department at PGIMER. 

 But industry executives have rubbished the claim, arguing that there is no evidence from anywhere in the world to show that mobile phones pose any risk to health. 

 This is complete rubbish, said Pankaj Mohendroo, president of the Indian Cellular Association. Mobile phones have been used in India since 1995 and there are no observed health effects. 

 More than 180 million people in India and up to a billion people worldwide use mobile phones. Surveys suggest that a subscriber in India uses a mobile phone for about 400 minutes each month less than 15 minutes each day, industry analysts said. 

 In the past 15 years of increasing mobile phone use around the world, theres absolutely no substantive evidence that mobile phones pose any health risk, said G.K. Chakrapani, country general manager, Nokia Enterprise Solutions. 

 Panda himself concedes the study merely points to a possible link. This study does not in any way establish a cause-and-effect relationship between mobile phone use and hearing loss, he said. 

 The PGIMER doctors compared hearing abilities of groups of people who had used mobile phones for various periods with people who had never used mobile phones. 

 The hearing loss was more in the dominant ear (the ear of use), Panda told The Telegraph. Ear warmth, fullness in the ears and strange noises in the ear are warning signals which users should not ignore. 

 The findings have been accepted for presentation at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery in Washington DC in September. 

 Mobile phones emit low levels of radio frequency radiation. But the US Food and Drug Administration had reviewed studies several years ago and said available scientific evidence does not demonstrate any adverse health effects associated with the use of mobile phones.

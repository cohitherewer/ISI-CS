 Cop turns train hero

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Jan. 28: A cop sitting in an air-conditioned coach of a derailed Tamil Nadu train today cut open a bogie that had tilted at right angles and pulled out nearly 75 people.

 Inspector-general Sylendra Babu was fortunately in none of the four bogies of the Coimbatore-Chennai Cheran Express that had jumped tracks near Vaniyambadi at 3.30 am. A fifth had tilted dangerously.The train suddenly jerked and halted and, on getting down, I found that three or four bogies were derailed and one compartment had completely turned 90 degrees, he said after reaching Chennai.

 Babu and some co-passengers spotted a pickaxe, possibly left by construction workers. With it, they cut open the vestibule and pulled out the passengers.

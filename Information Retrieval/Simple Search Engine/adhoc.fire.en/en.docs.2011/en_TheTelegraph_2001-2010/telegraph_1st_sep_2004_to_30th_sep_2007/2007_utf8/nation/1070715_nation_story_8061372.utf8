 Melbourne/New Delhi, July 14: An email by Mohammed Haneef has led Australian police to conclude that the car-bomb suspect wasnt entirely truthful about why he was in a hurry to leave the country.

 The Indian doctor was about to fly out of Australia on a one-way ticket on July 2 when he was detained at Brisbane airport. Haneef claims he was rushing back to Bangalore to see his sick wife and daughter, born on June 26.

 But in an affidavit presented before a magistrate, the police said Haneef had sent an email to an associate shortly after the failed June 29-30 UK attacks, saying he needed to leave Australia at once but not mentioning his wife and child.

 He said he had to leave in a hurry. He made no mention of his sick wife or child, an official said.

 Haneef had also made a flurry of phone calls to India just before his thwarted departure, including one to his brother who told him he had been linked to the bomb plot, prosecutor Clive Porritt said.

 But the Sydney Morning Herald quoted counter-terrorism officials as saying the email wasnt enough to charge the doctor.

 Police chief Mick Keelty said Haneef would be prosecuted in Australia unless British police have any evidence in the UK that would sustain an extradition application.

 Prime Minister John Howard urged caution today, saying Haneef was still entitled to the presumption of innocence.

 But without commenting on his particular circumstances, all of this is a reminder that terrorism is a global threat, he said.

 The Australian high commissioner to India, John McCarthy, met senior Indian diplomat Nalin Surie to brief him about Haneefs case. He confirmed that an Australian police officer was in India seeking mutual legal assistance about Haneef.

 Australian police have opposed Haneefs bail application, saying he might try to flee the country, but the defence lawyers have argued that the Indian is not a flight risk because his passport has been confiscated.

 Keelty defended the length of time investigators took to charge Haneef. He said the mammoth investigation involved about 300 policemen and lawyers, and a vast quantity of seized material that could fill 3,600 four-drawer filing cabinets.

 More searches

 Australian police are searching a house in Perth in connection with the alleged links between terrorism and some overseas-trained doctors. Forensic officers spent this afternoon carrying material from the house which has been sealed off to a tent set up outside it.

 Six Indian doctors were questioned in Australia after the botched UK bombings but all except Haneef have been released.

 In Britain, a judge has given the police until July 21 to continue questioning Jordanian doctor Mohammed Asha, 26, whose wife was released yesterday without charge. Under British terrorism laws, the police must charge him within 28 days of his arrest, that is, by July 28.

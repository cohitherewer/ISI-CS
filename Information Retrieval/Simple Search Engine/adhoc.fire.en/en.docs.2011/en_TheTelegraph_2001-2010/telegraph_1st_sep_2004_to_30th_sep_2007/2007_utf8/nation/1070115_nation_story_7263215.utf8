 Zahira kin held for liquor sale

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, Jan. 14: Zahira Sheikhs sister-in-law was arrested this morning in Vadodara on charges of bootlegging. 

 Heena, alias Kailas Vasava, was held around 9.30 am, when police raided Vadodaras Best Bakery, where she had been living since the death of husband Nafitulla, in Mumbai over a year ago. A few bottles of liquor were recovered. Sources said she was found with seven bottles of beer and whisky believed to be worth Rs 1,300.

 Vadodara police commissioner P.C. Thakur confirmed Heenas arrest, but said being a woman, she wont be kept in police lock-up. Selling liquor is illegal in Gujarat.

 This is the second time in two months that Heena has been held. Last time, she was arrested on charges of stealing and selling scrap from a construction site.

 Virtually deserted by her in-laws, Heena has been fending for herself and her two-year-old daughter. Her son lives with her mother in-law.

 A few months ago, she started a scrap business. Her arrest this time came after a tip-off from a neighbour. 

 Heena said she was selling liquor as she had no other way to survive. 

 She claimed she was the last person to know about her husbands death.

 China blow to students

 Beijing, Aug. 3 (PTI): Hundreds of Indians studying medicine in China will be affected by Beijings recent decision to limit to 30 the number of medical colleges that can offer courses in English to foreigners.

 The Chinese education ministry took the decision after receiving several complaints that some Chinese medical colleges, without having competent faculty, had rushed to offer degree programmes in English to foreigners, mostly Indians, at cheaper fees. 

 Some colleges have only expanded the enrolment of foreign students for their own economic benefits without improving their teaching methods, and some have even lowered the requirements for admission and never checked the candidates competence in English, the ministry said.

 The list of the schools that can offer courses in English can be found on the ministrys website.

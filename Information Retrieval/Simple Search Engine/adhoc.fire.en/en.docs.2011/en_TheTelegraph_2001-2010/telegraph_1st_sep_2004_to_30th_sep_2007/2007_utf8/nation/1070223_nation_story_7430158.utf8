 Bachchan ads get the axe

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Lucknow, Feb. 22: Amitabh Bachchan will no longer be heard asserting: UP mein hai dum, jurm yahan pe hai kam. 

 At least not till the Election Commission has checked the facts he is selling: that crime in Uttar Pradesh is less than in other states.

 The ad, which cites a Union home ministry report, and another in which Bachchan (in picture) says he would like to be reborn in the heartland state have been ordered off air by the Election Commission a day after it announced the Assembly polls.

 A committee headed by chief electoral officer Anuj Kumar Bishnoi has been set up to review the content of all political ads before granting them approval. Bishnoi said this was in line with a Supreme Court directive.

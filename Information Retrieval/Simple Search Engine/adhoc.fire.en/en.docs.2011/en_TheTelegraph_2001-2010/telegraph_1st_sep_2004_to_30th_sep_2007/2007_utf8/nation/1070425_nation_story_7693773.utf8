 Tuition fee rap on college

 New Delhi, April 24 (PTI): No educational institute can charge complete tuition fees at one go, the Delhi consumer commission has ruled.

 The ruling came on a plea by student Harpreet Walia against the Fore School of Management. A penalty of Rs 10,000 has been imposed on the college, which was also asked to refund Walias fees.

 The institutes or schools should not charge tuition fees for more than two to three months as the student may leave in the midstream if he finds the service deficient and sub-standard or non-yielding, the president of the commission, Justice J.D. Kapoor, said.

 Taking the college to task for not refunding fees of Rs 1.45 lakh to Walia, who had taken admission but could not join classes as she developed appendicitis, Justice Kapoor asked the institute to refund the fee with 9 per cent interest.

 The commission termed the refusal by the college as an unfair trade practice and said it needed to be curbed with heavy hands.

 Declining to accept the plea raised by the college that the student while taking admission had accorded to the clause that fee once paid was not refundable, Justice Kapoor described the clause as unconscionable and void.

 To tell a student that fee once paid is not refundable is uncalled for and an unfair trade practice as no service provider can take or charge the consideration for the service which it is yet to provide, the commission said.

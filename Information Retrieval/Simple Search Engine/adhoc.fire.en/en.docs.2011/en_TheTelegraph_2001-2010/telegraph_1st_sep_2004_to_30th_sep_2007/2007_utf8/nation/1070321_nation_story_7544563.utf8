 Flight congestion surcharge in glare

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 20: Private airlines have been asked to withdraw the congestion surcharge imposed on fliers, civil aviation minister Praful Patel told Parliament today.

 The airlines which argue that they are forced to slap the levy to pay for fuel burnt in circling over airports have been asked to respond by tomorrow, he said.

 The airlines are collecting Rs 150 extra on all routes, though there is no congestion at many airports, the minister said. The exception is the state carrier Indian.

 Arguing that only the Delhi and Mumbai airports face congestion, officials said the surcharge was like a tax not part of the fare that airlines are free to change.

 Patel told the House that the carriers have been left free to fix fares. The government stopped regulating ticket prices after the repeal of the Air Corporation Act, 1953. 

 Airlines have raised fares by 5-10 per cent, mostly through unannounced increases, though oil prices have come down in recent weeks. 

 Bargain-fare tickets are tougher to come by in the busy winter season as the number of seats set aside for cheaper fares have been reduced.

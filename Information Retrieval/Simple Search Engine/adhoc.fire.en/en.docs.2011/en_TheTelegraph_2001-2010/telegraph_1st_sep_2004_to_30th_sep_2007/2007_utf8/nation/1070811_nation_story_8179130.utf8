 Cagey start to riot review in Mumbai

 Vilasrao Deshmukh

 New Delhi/Mumbai, Aug. 10: Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh is believed to have told Congress bosses in Delhi he can do little about the Srikrishna Commission report beyond asking police to take a fresh look at the 92-93 riot cases.

 His alleged remarks reflect many state Congress leaders ambiguity on the issue despite Sonia Gandhis nudge to Deshmukh for sincere implementation of the report that indicts many Shiv Sena politicians and police officers over the massacre of 900 Muslims.

 Deshmukh today handed over the cases detailed in the Srikrishna report to the police to decide if they and how many of them should be reopened. The police will set up a special cell to re-examine 1,371 cases marked true (they happened) but undetected.

 The police have time till October before they face the Supreme Court, hearing petitions questioning the nine-year inaction on the report.

 Sources said Sonia wants to correct the perception that the government spared the Hindus involved in the December-January riots but went after Muslims after the March 12 Bombay blasts.

 Many Congress leaders, however, say a broader perspective is necessary. Their uneasiness is caused by:

 The perception that Bombay blasts judge Pramod Kode and special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam have emerged urban, middle-class heroes after the tough verdicts

 The fear of a Sena resurrection fuelled by cries of Muslim appeasement

 The indictment of three leaders of the Congress, which ruled the state in 92-93

 The fear of police morale being hit by the panels accusation of communal bias

 Ally Nationalist Congress Partys overtures to the Sena after the presidential poll strained BJP-Sena ties.

 The governments unease could affect the cases against Bal Thackeray, named in the report. Of the eight cases against the Sena chief, four have been withdrawn and cant be reopened by the police without a government nod.

 Of the rest, two are tagged false (didnt happen) and undetected, while the status of the other two is unknown. The 1,371 cases being reconsidered can at best include these two.

 Deshmukhs outlook on Hindu-Muslim questions has been dubbed ambivalent. He is said to have once asked aides why he had to carry the burden of secularism.

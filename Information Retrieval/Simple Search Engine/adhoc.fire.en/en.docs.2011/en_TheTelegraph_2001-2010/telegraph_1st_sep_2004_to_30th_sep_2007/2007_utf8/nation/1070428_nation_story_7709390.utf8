 Barrage hope for Bengal

 New Delhi, April 27: Bengals long-standing demand to make the Teesta barrage a national project has earned the Centres favour.

 An assurance to consider the demand came from Union water resource minister Saifuddin Soz when Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta and irrigation minister Subhas Naskar met him today.

 If tagged a national project, the Centre will fund 90 per cent of the barrage work. Its seal should also speed up the irrigation project, bringing relief to north Bengal residents.

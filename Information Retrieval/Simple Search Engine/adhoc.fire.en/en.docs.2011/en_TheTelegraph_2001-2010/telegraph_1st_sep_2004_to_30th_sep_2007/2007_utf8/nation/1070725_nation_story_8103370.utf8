 Satyam group GM snatched amp; freed

Hyderabad, July 24: A senior Satyam group executive kidnapped this morning was freed from his captors late tonight at a farmhouse on the outskirts of the city, police said.

 According to Hyderabad police commissioner Balwinder Singh, a team raided the hideout, 25km from the city, to pull V. Satyanarayana out of captivity, capping the hostage drama that, some reports suggest, began when the 40-year-old manager went to drop his kids to school.

 A ransom call for Rs 25 lakh helped the police track down the four abductors. The engineer is safe and the kidnappers are being interrogated behind bars, Singh said.

 Some reports suggested Satyanarayana, a general manager with Satyams insurance unit, was abducted from the school. Others said he was dragged out of his Accent on the way back and bundled into a Qualis by his abductors.

 Satyanarayana called his wife Lakshmi to say he had been kidnapped two hours after he disappeared. Investigations into the case had veered towards a possible real estate angle, with reports that Satyanarayana had a long-running dispute with his landlord. 

 But Lakshmi denied such problems. A police source had also played down the real estate row, saying their informers in the business would have had a clue about the incident.

 As the police tried to piece together the jigsaw, one version was that Satyanarayanas car was stopped at a clock tower near the Secunderabad railway station when he was driving back home after dropping his children to school. The police had found Satyanarayanas car near the airport in Begumpet. His mobile, left behind in the car, had been scanned for the calls he received before he was picked up. The phone is expected to help unravel the kidnap plot.

 Neighbours said Satyanarayana takes his children to Geetanjali School in Begumpet, about 8km from their upscale Secunderabad apartment, every morning.

 Earlier, the police had ruled out the involvement of Maoists or militant outfits. If they were militants, they would have taken the children away, too, an officer said. Suspicion also fell on an inter-state gang of robbers, who often work as guards or construction hands. The interrogation will now reveal if the abductors are, indeed, part of a larger kidnapping syndicate. 

 The abduction rattled Satyam, which was in touch with the police and Satyanarayanas family through the day. 

 The kidnapping was the first involving an IT professional in Hyderabad, home to nearly 1.5 lakh software experts. The Hyderabad Software Exporters Association, a forum of key IT firms, had said earlier in the day it was concerned about Satyanarayanas safety.

 The incident might be a source of worry for hundreds of IT firms, some part of the elite Fortune 500 list. 

 The only other instances of trouble in recent times had been the assault on a woman call-centre employee and the stabbing of an IT professional during a brawl in a pub.

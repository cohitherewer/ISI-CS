 Arjun to seek ruling review

 New Delhi, March 29: The human resource development ministry headed by Arjun Singh the main architect of the 27 per cent OBC quota bill is going to seek a review of todays interim court order by a larger judicial bench.

 The ministry will also seek an early date of hearing the court has set the next date of hearing in the third week of August.

 I am convinced the Supreme Court will be convinced that the law is valid, Singh said soon after the apex court struck down the quota for the 2007-08 academic year.

 Sources said the Centre will argue for an earlier date of hearing on the ground that there may be social unrest if the issue is kept hanging till August.

 The process of implementing the 27 per cent quota has already begun. The IIMs have had their admission tests and the admission boards will have to reconvene to work out another mechanism, officials said.

 The HRD ministry is also going to argue against a fresh OBC census on the ground that a nine-judge bench had considered the 1931 figures good enough to sanction a 27 per cent OBC quota in jobs. How can a two-judge bench overturn that decision?

 Till now there has been no census on the basis of caste. In 1978, the Mandal Commission used the 1931 census as its base to project the OBC population at 52 per cent. It was on the basis of this that the commission worked out a 27 per cent quota in jobs. The HRD ministry last year adopted the Mandal model for reservation in higher educational institutions.

 The National Sample Survey Organisation study in 1999 had put the OBC population at 32 per cent on the basis of the same 1931 census. In 1998, the National Family Health Survey placed it at 29 per cent.

 The court had earlier rapped the HRD ministry for projecting 27 per cent quota on the basis of an outdated census and reprimanded the government for rushing the decision.

 Singh has ruled out a caste census, at least by his ministry. The decision has to be taken by the government, he said earlier this month.

 The other argument the Centre is going to underline is the constitutional validity of the act. Singh indicated this when he said: Parliament has upheld the principle of reservation. Parliament will stick to it. There are legal objections. We will try to meet them.

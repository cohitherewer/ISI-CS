 Posco officials gheraoed

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, May 16: The going is getting tougher for Posco officials by the day.

 Five days after three executives of the Korean steel maker were taken hostage for several hours, women of Nuagaon part of the proposed site for the steel project gheraoed two Posco officials for about half-an-hour. 

 The gherao was held even as chief minister Naveen Patnaik today said he was ready for talks with the anti-Posco protesters as long as it was done in a peaceful way. 

 Poscos corporate social responsibility executive Debashis Swain and another executive Prasanta Rout were chased by angry women when they went to Nuagaon around 11.30 am to distribute medicines to woo villagers. 

 Swain, who on Friday was taken hostage for 10 hours, ventured into the village with Prasanta though police had advised them not to.

 Officer-in-charge of Kujanga police station Amarendra Panda said the two executives were kept hostage for about 30 minutes. 

 We had advised the company people to inform us before they visit the area. The situation is volatile and the company people should be cautious, said Panda, adding no FIR had been filed yet.

 Posco officials sought to downplay the incident. There was just some heated argument between the villagers and our officials. Our people then left the area, said Posco spokesperson Shashanka Pattnaik.

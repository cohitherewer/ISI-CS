 Fertiliser crack at Mulayam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 2: Land, food, and now fertilisers.

 Today, the BJP and the Bahujan Samaj Party were in the Congresss firing line for their alleged role in the misappropriation of fertiliser subsidy between 1994 and 2000.

 The last two exposs on the Noida land deal and the sale of foodgrain meant for a pro-poor scheme had dragged in Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadavs name.

 Union minister Kapil Sibal, fielded by the high command to speak on the scandals, alleged that between 1994 and 2000, as many as 29 fertiliser companies in the state made false claims to get subsidies. 

 Reacting to Sibals charges, BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said: Day after day, the minister is speaking on one scam or the other but he is twisting facts to suit the Congresss point of view. The Congress has been in power for three years but what stopped them from ordering a probe earlier? We are ready for one even now.

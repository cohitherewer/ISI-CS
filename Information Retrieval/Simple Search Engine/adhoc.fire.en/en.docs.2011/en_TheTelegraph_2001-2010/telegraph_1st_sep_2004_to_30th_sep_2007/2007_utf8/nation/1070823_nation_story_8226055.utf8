 Rumblings over Modi CD diktat

 BASANT RAWAT 

 Modi: TV trouble

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 22: Cable operators in Gujarat are fuming after poll-bound Narendra Modi asked them to air CDs on prime time tom-tomming his governments achievements.

 Pramod Pandya, the president of the Ahmedabad cable operators association, said government officials distributed the CDs 15 days ago and we were told to show them as many times as possible. 

 The operators, who are not being paid for this, were told to broadcast the CDs between 7pm and 9pm.

 Vipul Patel, a cable operator in Surat, said the office of the mamlatdar the government official in charge of entertainment, among other things sent written orders asking them to give details of the broadcast timings. 

 What is more, the operators were asked to collect the response to the CDs on postcards, which were to be sent to the state government.

 Patel said he received five CDs.

 But when the CDs were shown, complaints started pouring in from viewers across the state. 

 In Surat, cable operators yesterday held a meeting and decided to stop airing them. They also handed a memorandum to local Congress office-bearers, requesting them to take up the matter with their central leadership.

 Surat Congress president Sunil Bhukhanwala is planning to complain to the Election Commission. It is not right to compel anyone to telecast any programme free of cost. 

 Pandya is planning to approach the Centre seeking a policy to bar ruling parties from arm-twisting cable operators and forcing them to broadcast content free of cost.

 But Bhagyesh Jha, a senior official in the state information department, denied that the cable operators were forced to air the CDs and said there was no resistance. What we want is to disseminate information about state government schemes. It is a routine exercise which has nothing to do with politics. 

 The CDs, which have a story line and song and dance interspersed with Modis speeches, show Ratan Tata and the Ambani brothers endorsing the governments achievements. 

 US lobbying

 The chief minister, who was denied a US visa, has drafted the American lobbying firm Apco Worldwide to craft an image makeover that will rid him of his post-Godhra taint. Modi is keen to get a US visa, sources said.

 An official in the chief ministers office said the Washington-based consultancy will help Modi network at the summer Davos in China this September as well as the World Economic Forum in Davos next January. 

 Modi has been invited by the chairman of the World Economic Forum, Klause Schwab, as a special guest to narrate the Gujarat growth story at the forums China summit.

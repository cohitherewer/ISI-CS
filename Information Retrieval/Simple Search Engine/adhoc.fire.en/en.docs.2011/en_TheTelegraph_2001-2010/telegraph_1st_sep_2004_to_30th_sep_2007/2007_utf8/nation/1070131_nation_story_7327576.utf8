 New Delhi, Jan. 30: The UN will be asked to declare October 2 Mahatma Gandhis birthday as international non-violence day, it was announced today.

 A Congress-sponsored conference to commemorate hundred years of the satyagraha concluded with this declaration, moved by Sonia Gandhi. The 300 delegates who had gathered at Vigyan Bhavan for the conference on Peace, Non-violence and Empowerment: Gandhian Philosophy in the 21st Century acclaimed it with a show of hands.

 The declaration also resolved to strengthen the UN system as the principal mechanism for conflict resolution and pacific settlement of disputes and work for reforming its various organs to reflect the changes that have taken place since its inception.

 Sonia stressed that affirmations made in the resolution had to be translated into something tangible and proposed a mechanism to follow up on the implementation.

 Although eminent speakers such as Kenneth Kaunda and Archbishop Desmond Tutu had alluded to Iraq and the crisis in West Asia, there was no specific reference to these conflicts in the resolution. It spoke broadly of the need for people to re-dedicate themselves to the principle of non-violence, to fight the scourge of terrorism and promote a democratic and multilateral world order.

 Copies of a speech given by the late Rajiv Gandhi at a special sitting of the UN General Assembly on disarmament in 1988 were distributed at the session on a nuclear weapons-free and non-violent world order. Rajiv Gandhi had outlined a phased annihilation of nuclear weapons in three stages from 1988 to 2010.

 His son and Amethi MP Rahul Gandhi was expected to intervene in this session. But journalists who arrived sharp at 10 to hear him were disappointed when he didnt show up at all. Sonia came in briefly and left without saying a word.

 Those from the Congress who had spread the word that Rahul would speak looked sheepish and explained that he had already contributed his bit by taking exhaustive notes of the discussions at the two sessions yesterday.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh stressed on Gandhis relevance in contemporary times. Emphasising that the essence of the Mahatmas philosophy was empowerment of every individual, he said democracy was not just about fighting elections. It is about respecting the innate rights of all humans, he added.

 Tutu spoke of how deeply moved he was after Sonia turned down the Prime Ministers post magnanimously and graciously when she sensed it would create a rupture.

 Jawan welfare cheer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 20: Central paramilitary force jawans and their families now have a welfare board they can turn to.

 The Welfare and Rehabilitation Board set up by the Centre will have an all-India presence with six central welfare officers, 29 state welfare officers and 124 district welfare officers to look after the needs of the 8 lakh-odd jawans.

 The boards primary task would be looking after the immediate dependents of personnel dying in harness, helping resolve personal problems relating to childrens education, land and property issues and serious medical problems of jawans and their families.

 It is a welcome step that would help restive jawans feel better as they strongly feel they are treated shabbily in comparison to the army personnel who enjoy a more comfortable life and better welfare schemes, a BSF officer said. 

 In the past five years, the six paramilitary forces CRPF, ITBP, BSF, CISF, SSB and Assam Rifles have lost 6,181 jawans while 1,113 have been rendered disabled. The casualty rate is higher than in the army.

 At the apex level, the board will consist of a chairperson, a vice-chairperson and six members. By rotation, one of the directors-general of the forces will be chairperson. The additional director-general of the same force as the chairperson will be the vice-chairperson. Inspectors-general (administration) of all the six forces will be the other members.

 CRPF director-general S.I.S. Ahmed has been made the first chairperson of the board that is expected to develop a system of monitoring welfare and resettlement activity. 

 WARB will be required to negotiate with banks and financial institutions on behalf of the next of kin of jawans who have died and of retired personnel. 

 It will also be required to arrange counselling for self-employment and alternative employment for incapacitated jawans and the families of the dead. It will formulate strategies for employment of widows and work as the home ministrys principal advisory body in welfare matters, a senior home ministry official said.

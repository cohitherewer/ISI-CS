 Dhaka asks India for militants

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 New Delhi, June 26: Bangladesh has sent Delhi an Interpol red-corner notice asking for the return of about 30 Bangladeshi militants said to be hiding in Indian territory.

 The notice arrived about a week back, on the eve of the foreign secretary-level talks between the two sides. Shivshankar Menon travelled to Dhaka for the talks, which ended today.

 Terrorism and insurgency, under the diplomatic rubric of enhanced security cooperation and information sharing, was the main issue in the bilateral discussions. But for a change, the tone of the talks seemed to focus on co-operation, rather than accusation, sources said.

 Bangladesh, in fact, laid out the red carpet for Menon, giving him access to its leadership. The foreign secretary met army chief General Moeen U. Ahmed, the power behind the throne of caretaker President Fakhruddin Ahmed. Talks were also held with the President and foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Chowdhury.

 India has already been cracking down on some Bangladeshi militants in Bengal, and the Interpol notice will give the police more teeth to do so. On its part, Delhi would like Dhaka to step up action against Ulfa insurgents. These include big fish like Anup Chetia, who has been in Bangladesh for the past 10 years.

 The two sides agreed that India and Bangladesh have a shared destiny, the external affairs ministry said in a statement.

 Both countries are said to have taken forward the issue of the enclaves and adverse possessions the small bits of territory left behind in each others countries since the Bangladeshi liberation war of 1971. If the territory on either side were added up, it would not amount to more than 1000sq metres in favour of Bangladesh. The report of the joint boundary working group, which had travelled to the area recently, was discussed. 

 Menons worldview enjoins the quick resolution of such matters, especially where the benefits are long-lasting. Bangladesh has earlier suggested that the matter of enclaves and adverse possessions be resolved on an as is where is basis. This view is expected to prevail.

 Talks were held on the resolution of the remaining 6.5km of the boundary which is over 4,000sq km long. The two sides pledged to hold more talks on the 1974 land boundary agreement and take the demarcation issue forward. 

 Improving trade, especially the demand for removal of non-tariff barriers by Bangladesh, was a key concern. The working group on trade matters will be convened soon. 

 There was progress on people-to-people issues, such as increased travel. The train service from Joydebpur (just outside Dhaka) to Sealdah, for instance, is likely to begin soon.

 Ticket fine on airline

 New Delhi, April 15 (PTI): The state consumer commission has ordered Emirates airline to pay Rs 36,400 as compensation to a man whose confirmed ticket from here to Cyprus was cancelled at Dubai airport.

 The commission bench headed by Justice J.D. Kapoor directed the airline to pay the amount within a month to V.K. Bhatnagar a resident of Kosambi in Ghaziabad who could not attend a business meeting at Larnaca in Cyprus due to the cancellation.

 According to Bhatnagars complaint, he had booked a ticket with a Delhi-based travel agent in 1997 for his journey to Larnaca via Dubai.

 At Delhis Indira Gandhi International Airport, Bhatnagar, who was allowed to board the flight to Dubai, was informed that his ticket was cancelled, the complaint added.

 He, however, was assured that he would get a seat in the connecting flight to Larnaca at Dubai airport. This was not provided, forcing him to buy another ticket. But Bhatnagar still failed to make it to the Larnaca meeting.

 In view of the fact that the passenger travelled up to Dubai and thereafter he purchased a ticket for Larnaca, we deem that the airline was liable to compensate as to the cost of the ticket purchased as well as expenses incurred for the stay and reasonable compensation for the mental agony, the commission said.

 The order came in response to an appeal filed by Emirates against an earlier order of a district consumer forum, which had asked it to pay Rs 54,400 as compensation to Bhatnagar after holding it guilty of deficiency in services.

 The commission, which partly allowed the airlines appeal by decreasing the fine by Rs 18,000, said Bhatnagar had to be compensated for mental agony.

 New Delhi, July 21: A gentle trickle of rain greeted Pratibha Patil as she stepped out of her house for her first public appearance after being elected President. 

 The occasion was historic Pratibha will be the first woman President of India once she is sworn in. 

 Her striking yellow-and-red Kanjeevaram saree with a gold border stood out in the dull, grey exterior of Pratibhas residence on South Avenue. 

 The election was a victory of principles, a victory of right thinking, she said, without so much as a smile or a wave, much to the disappointment of the photographers who had been waiting for hours.

 The lensmen egged her to wave, and the hand came out feebly and briefly.

 Pratibhas first words were almost identical to those of information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who called the election result a victory of conscience. 

 They would be her last words as a party member for the next five years. 

 She no longer belongs to the party. She now belongs to the nation, Congress leader Ashwani Kumar said as he came out after visiting Pratibha. 

 An hour ago the celebrations started at 5pm Pratibha would have had to drive down to 10 Janpath to meet Sonia Gandhi, and to 7 Race Course Road for a tte--tte with the Prime Minister. 

 Now, the rules of protocol demanded just the opposite.

 Around 6pm, the Congress presidents cavalcade arrived, and her party supporters erupted into slogans like Jai Pratibha and Jai Sonia. 

 Manmohan Singh followed a few minutes later. 

 Sonia and Singh left one after the other, and Pratibhas aides began hinting that it was time to close the enormous white pandal that had been erected for supporters and the media in front of the house. 

 Ab band kar lete hain. Nikalna hain, one of them said.

 Bachchan ad sparks poll row

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Jan. 17: A television ad that has Amitabh Bachchan singing praises of Uttar Pradesh is at the centre of a controversy, with the Congress and V.P. Singhs Jan Morcha complaining to the Election Commission about it.

 Congress vice-president Siraz Mehendi said in a statement this morning: The advertisement was meant to hush up all the frustrations of the ruling party. The party should have spent the advertisement money on some development projects. The Election Commission should take note of its expenses. 

 Elections are due in the state soon.

 In the Samajwadi Party commercial, Bachchan talks about progress in the state and says he would like to be reborn there, on the banks of the Ganga.

 Agra MP Raj Babbar, of the Jan Morcha, said the commercial is being aired at a cost of Rs 5 crore per week per channel and demanded that the ruling party include the cost in its election budget.

 He also appealed to the Election Commission to order a probe. Where has this money come from? This should be the subject of an inquiry, the actor-turned-MP said. 

 Bachchan should also clarify his stand and tell the people if he really believes in what he has said in the ad, Babbar said.

 The tall and lanky film star has been aspiring to a rebirth in this state, he said. However, his father (Harivansh Rai Bachchan) would have never thought of being reborn in a state under chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav.

 Other than the television ad highlighting the Mulayam Singh governments achievements, many Bachchan hoardings with Samajwadi leaders have come up all across the state.

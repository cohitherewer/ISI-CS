 Hush-up charge on Sabeel

 AMIT ROY 

 London, July 16: Sabeel Ahmed, a 26-year-old doctor from Bangalore, asserted his religious identity by wearing traditional white robes when he appeared today in the City of Westminster Magistrates Court. 

 Sabeel, who worked at Halton Hospital in Runcorn, Cheshire, was charged with possessing information which could have prevented an act of terrorism. 

 What this means is that, according to the prosecution, Sabeel allegedly knew that his older brother, Kafeel, 27, and Bilal Talal Abdullah, a 27-year-old Iraqi doctor, were planning acts of terrorism in relation to the failed car bombs in London on June 29 and Glasgow on June 30. The latter has already been charged with conspiracy to cause explosions. 

 Hours after a flaming Cherokee Jeep was rammed into the Glasgow airport terminal, Sabeel was arrested on the evening of June 30 in Liverpool near Lime Street railway station by police who disabled him by shooting him with a Taser gun. 

 He is charged formally under Section 38 of the Terrorism Act 2000 with having information which he knew or believed may be of material assistance in preventing the commission by another of an act of terrorism. 

 The magistrates court in London was heavily guarded as Sabeel came and went quickly. He spoke only to give his name, address and date of birth during the 20-minute hearing. 

 His lawyer, Nadeem Afzal, said his client intended to plead not guilty to the charge. 

 Observers will see it as significant that Sabeel chose to don the clothes of an orthodox Muslim, indicating he is proud to proclaim his Islamic faith, rather than affect the professional look of a doctor by putting on a dark suit and tie. 

 The court heard that Sabeel is the brother of Kafeel Ahmed who was detained at Glasgow airport after the burning Jeep was driven into a terminal building. He suffered 90 per cent burns to his body and remains under armed guard in a specialist burns unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. 

 Karen Jones, prosecuting, told the court that the injured man was in an extremely poor physical state. 

 This should be taken to mean that the authorities do not rate his survival chances as high. 

 She added that the charge against Sabeel is connected to the investigation into the two failed car bombs found in central London and the incident at Glasgow Airport. 

 The court heard that Sabeel holds no tenancy agreement for his home in Ramilies Road in Liverpool, and that he has not applied to extend his working visa. 

 District Judge Anthony Evans remanded Sabeel in custody and said that the case would be reviewed at the magistrates court next Monday before a committal hearing on August 13.

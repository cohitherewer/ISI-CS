 Calcutta, April 12: A late evening squall coupled with a shower brought relief from the heat but left commuters stranded.

 Traffic was disrupted with the storm uprooting trees at several places. Air traffic was also hit as many flights were diverted and some failed to take off on time. Power supply was affected in some parts of south Calcutta.

 The director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore, G.C. Debnath, said todays squall was a Norwester. 

 We had issued a warning for a squall accompanied with hail in Calcutta and seven south Bengal districts. We expect thunderstorms tomorrow in Calcutta and most Bengal districts, he said.

 Debnath said as the wind was blowing in from the sea, there was a heavy incursion of moisture. Also, a cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) over Gangetic Bengal had led to sucking in of more moisture. We now have conditions favourable for formation of thunderclouds. We expect more rains tomorrow.

 Five Calcutta-bound flights were diverted and several others were delayed.

 Air Deccans flights from Delhi, Mumbai and Ranchi and Jet Airwayss flights from Mumbai and Chennai were diverted to Bhubaneswar in the evening. Airport officials said the flights were scheduled to return late in the night.

 According to officials, flight services were disrupted between 6.30 pm and 8 pm. Indians Mumbai flight could not take off at 6.30 pm. Flights of Air Deccan, Air Sahara, Jet and other airlines were also delayed. Things became normal late in the evening.

 On Motilal Nehru Road, a car was damaged after a tree fell on it along with a mesh of electric wires. It led to a traffic snarl. There were reports of similar disruptions in Beleghata, CIT Road and Northern Avenue.

 Maninder conduit picked up

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 25: Delhi police are pinning their hopes on a suspected conduit they picked up last night to uncover the network that supplied drugs to Maninder Singh.

 Sundermurthi was arrested from his house in south Delhis Jangpura area. The police claim he sold the drugs to Saim Siddiqui, a cricket coach at the National Sports Club who was caught with Maninder.

 It is hoped that Sundermurthis arrest will help investigators expose the drug ring and how the cocaine reached the former left-arm spinner. 

 Maninder got bail on Wednesday. Saims custody ended today. 

 Sundermurthi, the police said, is at best a small-time operator who may have procured the drugs from Mumbai and other places. 

 Police teams might head to Mumbai where many drug consignments from Africa reach first to track those who might have supplied the cocaine to Maninder.

 The police will seek the custody of Sundermurthi, who is suspected to have influential people as his clients. His interrogation has yielded references to a couple of well-known personalities, but their identities are not known yet.

 About 125 grams of hashish was found on Sundermurthi during the arrest. The amount is enough to bring trafficking charges against him.

 A.S. Cheema, the narcotics cell chief, said investigations so far showed Sundermurthi sold drugs for quick money.

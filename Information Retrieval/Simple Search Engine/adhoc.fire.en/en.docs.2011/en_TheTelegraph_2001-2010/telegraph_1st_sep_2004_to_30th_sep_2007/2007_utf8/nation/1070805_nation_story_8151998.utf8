 UP opens farm retail to private players

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mayavati: One up on Buddha

 Lucknow, Aug. 4: Mayavati has done what Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee could not allow contract farming and private investment in the agricultural retail market.

 The Uttar Pradesh chief minister has launched a new agriculture policy that follows in the footsteps of Punjab, Gujarat, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. 

 Private players with a net worth of Rs 500 crore and above will be allowed in the farm sector, according to the policy. 

 Contract farming where investors enter into a deal with farmers for the cultivation of a crop, contribute seeds, fertiliser, pesticides, etc. and agree to buy the produce at a pre-determined price is in practice in places in Bengal, but the government has no official policy.

 Let me clarify that the contract between the farmers and the private investors would be over the produce only and the investor can never claim any right on his land, Mayavati said.

 She also said the state would encourage private wholesale markets, ending the monopoly of government-run mandis. Any investor seeking to purchase more than 12.5 acres for a mandi would get incentives, she said. 

 Left-ruled states, including Bengal, have balked at allowing private players into farm retail, arguing that small farmers would not be able to hold their own against large corporate houses. The previous Samajwadi Party regime in Uttar Pradesh had taken the same line, pointing out that 90 per cent of the farmers have small land holdings.

 These farmers would be ruined when the policy is put into effect, said Ambika Chaudhary, revenue minister in the last government.

 But Satish Mishra, the minister in charge of Mayavatis office, said the new policy would help end farmer suicides. The states farmers are in dire need of private investment so that they can get the just price for their produce.

 Bhattacharjee has long been trying to allow private investment into farm retail but has had his plans blocked by the Left Front. Reliances efforts to enter the business raised a furore. The state has now left it to the Centre to formulate a policy on regulating such private investment.

 On contract farming, to which his party is opposed as well, the government has taken the line that it will not intervene so long as both sides the farmer and the private investor are happy. But it has chosen not to come out with an official policy, avoiding controversy.

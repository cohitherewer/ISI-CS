 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Tiff with wife hits new high

 This must have been the height of marital discord for many.

 A 35-year-old farm labourer clambered up a coconut tree and kept an entire village on the edge by staying there for 22 hours before threats to open fire from the police got him down.

 After he went missing from home, seething over a tiff with his wife, Chinnarajs family took almost two hours to find out that he was perched on the 40-feet-high tree.

 When police and fire-services personnel rushed to the spot, in Dharmapuri districts Agaram village, the agile farm worker did his best to keep them from reaching him he plucked and hurled coconuts at them.

 Later, the rescue team was told to accept a few demands if they wanted him to come down. They were asked to deliver food and bidis in a rope-strung cloth bag.

 But, having had his fill and puff, Chinnaraj turned tail. He even slept for a while, though many in the village hadnt been able to catch a few winks. He gave up only after one angry policeman issued the firing threat.

 JNU honours its first teacher

 Jawaharlal Nehru University honoured its first teacher, M.S. Rajan, at a unique Teachers Day celebration. 

 The 84-year-old, the author of several books, started the School of International Studies in 1962. Seven years later, the school, along with the Centre for Russian Studies, came to be recognised by the government as JNU. 

 At the ceremony organised by the JNU Teachers Association, Rajan reminisced about the decades he spent teaching at the university. It may appear strange, but not much has changed here since my time. Yes, the facilities have improved, as is the need of the times, but the ethos of JNU remains the same, Rajan said. 

 JNU chancellor Yashpal handed Rajan a medallion in recognition for his contribution to the university. Some of Rajans former students, who are now teachers at JNU, offered a personal memento to their former teacher. 

 Pay amp; stay for Games

 Delhi clearly savours the prospect of hosting the Common Wealth Games. The Assembly recently cleared a bed-and-breakfast scheme for visitors to the 2010 sports gala.

 Under the plan, households will offer paying-guest accommodation to the foreign tourists arriving for the Games. 

 Chief minister Sheila Dikshit said the legislation, allowing residents to offer the facilities, is a first for any state where large sporting events have been organised. 

 The scheme will help meet the lodging demand for an estimated 30,000 tourists and generate income for the local hosts. Registration and other formalities under the plan have been simplified, though security aspects will be monitored closely. 

 Households signing up must provide the guests parking space, a separate air-conditioned room, laundry facilities and an opportunity to experience the countrys traditions and relish authentic Indian cuisine, Dikshit said. 

 Doll-up store

 Bangalore might have broken new ground in opening a flurry of new malls and plazas.

 Last week, the city was abuzz with the launch of Bare Body Essentials, a store touted as Indias first high-end retail destination dedicated to personal care, cosmetics and perfumes.

 Spread over 3000sqft, the flagship store will stock about 50 cosmetic brands for men and women in the ultra-premium and speciality categories, said U.K. Singh, a member of the board that runs the store.

 Asked why he chose Bangalore, Singh said the city is very cosmopolitan and attuned to global culture and trends. 

 Delhi: Wind up after the days grind to an evening of soulful raagas this Saturday. Malti Gilani and Shanno Khurana present a Hindustani classical vocal recital at the India International Centre auditorium. The show begins at 6pm. Passes available on a first-come first-served basis.

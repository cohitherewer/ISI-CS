 Singh sermon to courts on limits

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 8: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today asked the judiciary to stick to its territory and not stray into legislative or executive matters, bringing the growing tensions between the Centre and the judiciary to the fore.

 The dividing line between judicial activism and judicial over-reach is a thin one. All organs (of state), including the judiciary, must ensure that the dividing lines between them are not breached, he said at a conference of high court chief justices and chief ministers in Delhi.

 The governments much-touted quota policy 27 per cent reservation for OBCs in all central institutes of higher education was recently stayed by the Supreme Court.

 On the responsibilities of the judiciary in the context of judicial reforms to ensure speedy justice Singh asked the judiciary not to over-reach its mandate under the Constitution. 

 While the judiciary, he said, was well within its rights to ask state authorities to perform their duties, attempts to take over the functions of other organs of state could constitute over-reach.

 Substituting mandamus (a writ issued by courts to government officials to perform a function) with a take-over of the functions of another organ may, at times, become a case of over-reach, the Prime Minister said.

 Each organ of the state must respect the other, and respect each others mandates under the Constitution, he said.

 Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, speaking at the conference, however, called tensions between the executive and the judiciary natural and to some extent desirable.

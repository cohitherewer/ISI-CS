 Sachin pays and appeals

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 15: Sachin Tendulkar has paid a part of the tax that was waived on his foreign income, government sources said.

 The cricketer has also filed an appeal before the income-tax commissioner. It is likely to be heard soon, sources in the department said today.

 In a report tabled in Parliament yesterday, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India had said the exemption of around Rs 3.6 crore was unwarranted as the source of the money was endorsement, not an international sporting event. 

 The report also mentioned unfair exemption to Sunil Gavaskar. 

 The CAG report had pulled up the department for allowing the exemption. The tax department had said the two cricketers were artists and were entitled to the exemptions, an argument the CAG overruled.

 Officials in Mumbai said that after the errors were pointed out last year, the department tried to correct them by reopening the assessment of Sachins earnings.

 A tax official, reluctant to specify when or how much Sachin paid, said: The party was told and he agreed to pay a part of the amount.

 The amount could be around Rs 1 crore, about a third of the exemption granted to Sachin, another official said.

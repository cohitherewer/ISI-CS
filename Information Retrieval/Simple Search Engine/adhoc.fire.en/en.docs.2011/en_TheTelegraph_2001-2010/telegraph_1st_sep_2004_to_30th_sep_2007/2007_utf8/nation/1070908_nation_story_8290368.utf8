The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Be-brave sermon from PM 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: Prime 

 Minister Manmohan Singh had a message for the Left at a 

 book release today.

 If we remain divided, defensive and disruptive in our discourse, our children and our grandchildren will not forgive us. They will find us wanting for not having had the courage to grapple with the real challenges of our time, he said, without putting his remarks into a specific context.

 But there were enough hints in Singhs text to suggest that the subtext of his speech was the Indo-US nuclear deal and its rejection by the Left and the Opposition. 

 Too much of political life in India was focused on here and now, he said. Too much of political discourse is obsessed with the past and ignorant about the future. We need people who can think into the future, look at the challenges of tomorrow and take the country forward. 

 The Prime Minister invoked a Nehruvian metaphor: This, I believe, is Indias moment. Let us not dither. Let us not shy away in fear of some ghosts in our mind so that India may truly make its tryst with destiny.

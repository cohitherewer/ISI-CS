 Monsoon to hit Kerala a week early

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 14: The monsoon will hit the Indian mainland a week earlier this year, with the first rains expected in Kerala by May 24 instead of June 1, weather scientists said today.

 They said conditions over the Bay of Bengal were conducive to an early onset but cautioned that its implications on how much rain India would get during the four-month monsoon season remained unclear.

 The monsoon currents arrived in the south Andaman Sea on May 10, about a week in advance of the usual date of May 18, Indian Meteorological Department officials said. Forecasts based on existing weather over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal point to an early onset. 

 The processes that influence the onset of rainfall are different from those that influence the quantum of rainfall in the season, said Madhavan Rajeevan, director of the National Climate Centre in Pune. In the past, weve had years with early onset and good rain as well as early onset and bad rain.

 The early onset over Kerala does not suggest an early monsoon over the interior parts of the country, particularly over northern India, according to weather scientists.

 Last month, the Met department had predicted that the 2007 monsoon rainfall would be slightly 5 per cent below average.

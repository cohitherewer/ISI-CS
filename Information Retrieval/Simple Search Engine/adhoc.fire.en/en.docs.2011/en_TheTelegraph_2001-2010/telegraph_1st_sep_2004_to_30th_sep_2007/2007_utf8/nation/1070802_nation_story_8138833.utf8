 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Click brigade on party spot prowl

 Hyderabad police are worried the citys people are partying too hard and getting far too cosy while attending them.

 They dont want to play nanny, but are rolling up their sleeves to make sure that the line between celebration and indecency is not crossed along the way.

 The police plan to take pictures of couples in indecent postures in public places. Deputy commissioner N. Madhusudhan Reddy feels even pubs are public places and, therefore, will be part of the drive to sanitise hotspots. 

 We have identified six in the Banjara and Jubilee Hills where obscene and provocative dances are performed to attract customers, Reddy said. However, the police say they will be cautious not to harass couples or genuine customers.

 Plainclothes policemen will secretly click away in the joints. The photos will be used as evidence in a crackdown or for possible prosecution against such establishments. The undercover click brigade will also help keep tabs on antisocial elements and crime lords.

 A leg-up for the elderly

 Those who find walking across the capitals traffic-choked streets a pain can look forward to a leg-up of sorts.

 Pedestrians crossing busy junctions on overbridges have some comfort coming their way. Escalators at 12 overbridges at junctions with the heaviest traffic will be up and running soon. 

 The elderly and the physically disadvantaged are the ones who face the biggest problems crossing traffic-ridden junctions. And, unfortunately, these are the very people who find the overbridges most unfriendly. This was a long-felt need, the urban development minister in the Delhi government, A.K. Walia, said. 

 The government has also identified 31 other junctions where the escalators will be installed in the next stage of the project.

 The authorities have asked the Delhi Vidyut Board to provide uninterrupted power supply for the escalators.

 Sun eclipse delayed

 The Sun TV eclipse may have been put off by a few months, but the fault, as is often suspected, lies not with the stars.

 The challenger to the channel, owned by the Maran family which has fallen out with the DMK patriarch M. Karunanidhi, was to have gone on air from August 15. The new date now being mentioned is September 15, which coincides with DMK founder Annadurais birthday.

 Sources say Kalaignar TV, named after Karunanidhi, who is called Kalaignar because of his literary skills, will use the extra time to put in place high-tech equipment and recruit the best broadcasting professionals. The channel is being set up by Rajendran, who owns Raj TV.

 The chief minister is believed to be keen that Kalaignar meaning litterateur is launched with a bang. Billboards announcing the arrival of the channel have come up in front of the office of Murasoli, the party organ. The news channel will focus on the DMKs activities, especially those of Karunanidhis children M.K. Stalin, M.K. Azhagiri, and Kanimozhi.

 Tax twist

 Property owners may have a tax breather coming their way if the Delhi government clears a civic body request.

 The Municipal Corporation of Delhi wants exemptions from property tax for those who had opted for a 1986 scheme under which they wouldnt have to pay any more tax for life if they forked out a 10-year sum in one go.

 An amendment to the Delhi Municipal Corporation act is needed to continue the exemptions. The civic body feels it should honour its commitment and not insist on fresh payments.

 Delhi: This Thursday, renowned artist Satya Prakash Sharma presents some of his best works at the Triveni Kala Sangam on Tansen Marg, next to the busy ITO junction. The exhibition is open from 11am to 8pm. The venue is a two-minute walk from the Mandi House Metro station.

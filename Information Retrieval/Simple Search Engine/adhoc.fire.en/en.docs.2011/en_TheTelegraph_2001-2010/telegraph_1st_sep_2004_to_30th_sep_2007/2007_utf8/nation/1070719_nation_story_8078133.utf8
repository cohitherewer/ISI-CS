 Zee arms to face music in court

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 18: Zee Entertainment will fight the music copyright violation case it faces in court and will not succumb to arm-twisting.

 The decision follows a court injunction on using copyrighted music on its shows. 

 Delhi High Court had passed the interim injunction on July 10 in response to a case filed by the licensing authorities the Indian Performing Rights Society (IPRS) and the Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL). 

 We have not received the court order yet. But we will follow the order and respond to it by Thursday. And then, we plan to file a counter-appeal during the next hearing, which is on October 10, said Ashish Kaul, the executive vice-president of Zee Network and Essel Group. 

 Kaul said the conflict with the IPRS and the PPL began after the two organisations claimed an atrocious amount as licence fee for us- ing music copyrighted to them. 

 As for the talent hunt show, Saregamapa 2007, which the interim order had specifically mentioned, Kaul said it was banal for the IPRS to suggest that the show would have to go off air. 

 Thats because we can very well continue to play music not copyrighted to the IPRS and get along with the show, he added.

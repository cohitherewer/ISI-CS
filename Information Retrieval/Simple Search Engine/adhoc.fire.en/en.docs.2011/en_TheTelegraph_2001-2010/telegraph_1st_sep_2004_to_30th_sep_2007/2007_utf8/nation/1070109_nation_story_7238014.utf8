 New Delhi, Jan. 8: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh continues to have Pakistan on his mind.

 Ahead of external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjees visit to Islamabad on January 13, Singh said he dreamt of the day when the people of South Asia would be able to move freely across boundaries.

 I dream of a day when, while retaining our respective national identities, one can have breakfast in Amritsar, lunch in Lahore and dinner in Kabul. That is how my forefathers lived. That is how I want our grandchildren to live, the Prime Minister said at a meeting of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry today.

 Singh said the destiny of the people of South Asia, and their past and future were interlinked. Indias stability and prosperity was dependent on the economic prosperity of its neighbourhood, he added. 

 The Prime Minister said terrorism and extremism could not be allowed to come in the way of the exploitation of common opportunities.

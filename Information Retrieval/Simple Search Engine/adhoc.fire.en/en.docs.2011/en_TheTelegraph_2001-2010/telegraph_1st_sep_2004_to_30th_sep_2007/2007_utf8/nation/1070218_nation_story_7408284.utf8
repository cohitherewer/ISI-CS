The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Eye on martyr tag

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: The Mulayam Singh Yadav government today brushed off the cloud of Presidents rule hanging over its head, saying it was ready to face the gallows.

 We are ready for martyrdom, the Samajwadi Partys chief whip in Parliament, Mohan Singh, said amid speculation that the Uttar Pradesh government could be dismissed any moment.

 On the hectic political activity in the UPA after governor T.V. Rajeswar sent his report to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Singh said a possible dismissal of the Samajwadi-led government would prove to be a misadventure for the Congress, which heads the ruling coalition at the Centre.

 The imposition of Presidents rule in UP would be nothing but a reflection of the suicidal tendency of the Congress, Singh said. 

 The Samajwadi leader added that the Congress would have to pay a heavy price in the forthcoming Assembly elections if it carried out the threat of dismissing the Mulayam government. The Congress will be wiped out because of this misadventure, which will be a direct help to the BJP.

 As for his own party, Singh said it was prepared for any eventuality as its government has met all the promises it had made to the people of Uttar Pradesh.

 We have finished all our work that we had promised to the people of the state. Now we are ready to face the gallows, Singh added.

 He said the Samajwadi Party would move court if Presidents rule is imposed. We are ready to take a stay from the Supreme Court if the Congress-led UPA government dismisses the UP government.

 Samajwadi sources said the party has already chalked out a strategy to make up for the losses that it might have to suffer in the event of the governments dismissal. 

 The party is planning to take to the streets with a vigorous campaign. 

 This would be an excellent opportunity to shift the focus from the so-called misrule by Mulayam Singh Yadav and to project him as a rebel ready to sacrifice anything to safeguard Muslims from the Congresss design to help the BJP, a senior Samajwadi leader said.

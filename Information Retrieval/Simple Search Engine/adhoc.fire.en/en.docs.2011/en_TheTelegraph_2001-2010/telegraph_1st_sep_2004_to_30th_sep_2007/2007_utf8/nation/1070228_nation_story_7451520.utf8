 Six months to make peace with UN boss

 K.P. NAYAR

 New York, Feb. 27: Nearly six months after Indias nominee came second and threatened Ban Ki-moons chances to be UNs eighth secretary-general, New Delhi has formally made peace with the victorious South Korean.

 Foreign secretary Shivshankar Menon yesterday spent nearly 40 minutes with Ban at the UN headquarters here in a meeting that was described by both sides as very friendly.

 Menon is the first official or minister from New Delhi to meet the new secretary-general although he was elected on October 13 last year.

 Bans point of contact with India since then has been Indias permanent representative here, Nirupam Sen, who attended yesterdays meeting.

 Menon met Ban in the backdrop of Indias bid for a non-permanent seat in the UN Security Council for a two-year term from January 1, 2011.

 New Delhis chances for the seat are bright because its rivals so far for the Asian seat are Kazakhstan and Thailand.

 A victory for India in the autumn of 2010 will come 14 years after its disastrous defeat in a similar election in 1996.

 Ban assured Menon yesterday that he will be neutral in Indias efforts to secure a permanent seat in the Security Council as and when the UNs top table is reorganised.

 There was a streak of catharsis in his assurance because Ban had led South Koreas efforts until late last year to block the Group of Four India, Japan, Brazil and Germany from realising their joint effort to reform the Security Council.

 Seoul is a leading member of the Coffee Club which opposes the Group of Four and Ban was his countrys foreign minister until he moved to the UN.

 What came through from yesterdays meeting between the secretary-general and the foreign secretary was that Ban needs India much more than the other way round, according to a large spectrum of diplomats at the UN. India is one of the trenchant opponents of the secretary-generals current efforts to restructure the UN secretariat, specifically to downgrade the present Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO). India has a huge stake in the DPKO because of its troop contributions to UN operations.

 The non-aligned countries and members of the Group of 77 (G-77), which have around two-thirds majority in the UN General Assembly, have so far frustrated Bans efforts to make sweeping changes at the UN. India is a leader in both groups and New Delhis support is, therefore, crucial for the new secretary-general.

 South Korea is a member of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and is, therefore, not a member of the G-77. It is treaty ally of the US and is, therefore, not in the non-aligned movement.

 Ban has been handicapped by his lack of any previous influence in either group and has been relying on his chief of staff, Vijay Nambiar, to influence these two groups, which have the decisive power of numbers in the General Assembly.

 Ban yesterday ensured that Nambiar was present at the meeting with Menon. Nambiar is a former Indian ambassador to the UN and helped smoothen the peace-making between New Delhi and the new secretary-general.

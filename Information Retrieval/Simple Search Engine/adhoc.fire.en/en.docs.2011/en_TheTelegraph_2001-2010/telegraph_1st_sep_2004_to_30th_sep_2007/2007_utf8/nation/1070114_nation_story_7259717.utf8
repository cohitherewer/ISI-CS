The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 An FM channel from a B-school

 - Tune in for Masti amp; music

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Brain wave

 Hyderabad, Jan. 13: Another FM channel is jostling for space in Hyderabads crowded airwaves. But this is no ordinary radio station. 

 The Indian School of Business (ISB), which celebrates its fifth birthday this year, has gifted itself an in-house FM channel.

 Hello folks. This is Radio ISB your very own fountain of masti and music, welcomes a cheerful voice as the B-school students tune in to take a break from classes.

 Launched on December 3, 2006, the online station transmits its shows through the internal network. The students can listen in on their laptops across the Wi-fi campus.

 Sindhu Shanmugham, the brain behind Radio ISB, said he was pleasantly surprised at the managements response to his proposal.

 When I went to them, I thought my proposal was weird and would be axed right away, but the management was all sweet and cooperative, said the student, whose business acumen had paid dividends even before hes got a degree. 

 ISB also offered the students Rs 10,000. All we needed were two headphones, two microphones and a broadcast software, said Megha, another MBA student, adding that content gathering was not a problem.

 Apart from music, what has caught the students ears are the campus gossip and digs at the faculty and staff. 

 They made fun of us, you know, said Bhuvana Ramalingam, the corporate communications director of ISB, rolling her eyes in mock anger. 

 On the channels daily menu are news hour followed by music, gossip and skits or mimicry by students. 

 A team of five students who have turned part-time radio jockeys runs Radio ISB for two hours every evening. It is more or less a dinner show, said an ISB official.

 The teachers, too, are pleased with the effort.

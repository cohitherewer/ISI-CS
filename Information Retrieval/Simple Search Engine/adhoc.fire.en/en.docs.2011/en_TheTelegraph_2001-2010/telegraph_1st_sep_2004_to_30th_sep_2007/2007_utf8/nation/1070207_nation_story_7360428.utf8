 Bank goonda rap 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: Banks cannot use the services of goondas to recover loans, the Supreme Court said today. 

 The court also directed ICICI Bank to place before it guidelines issued by the RBI and the Indian Banks Association for appointment of recovery agents.

 A bench headed by Justice A.R. Lakshmanan, while hearing an appeal seeking quashing of a criminal complaint against ICICI Bank officials, said that no bank could be allowed to harass and intimidate customers by sending musclemen to recover loans or take away vehicles purchased under the hire-purchase system. 

 You have every right to recover the loan. But that should be only through legal means. But you cannot send goondas and musclemen to recover the loans, the bench told the banks counsel.

 Justice Lakshmanan cited an instance where the judge himself had come across a case where a bank sent its musclemen to the house of a defaulter and intimidated his wife for recovery of the loans. Such methods should be avoided by banks, he added.

 Allahabad High Court had refused to quash a criminal case against top bank officials for using musclemen to seize the vehicle of a person who had defaulted in making payments. 

 The bank, thereafter, approached the apex court against the order. 

 The apex court noted that banks could only recover through legal means and the proper course would have been to first issue a notice to the defaulter to surrender the vehicle and then file a case. 

 Senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the bank, however, said that the RBI and Bank Association guidelines provided for hiring agents to recover loans and vehicles. 

 The court said collection agents could not be allowed to use force and many a times they use force without the knowledge of the bank. They have to resort to legal means, it added.

 Ordering a stay on the arrest of bank officials, the court directed the bank to produce copies of the guidelines within four weeks. 

 Prakash Kaur, who had taken loan for purchase of a commercial vehicle, had alleged that the bank had sent musclemen to seize the vehicle after default in payment.

 While agreeing that strong-arm tactics should not be adopted, the banks counsel said only a few of the agents become overzealous in their pursuit to recover the loans.

 Dad chops call centre teenager

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 19: Delhi 

 police have arrested a man believed to have killed his daughter 

 with an axe after taunts from neighbours about her alleged 

 sexual escapades. 

 Nandan Singh, in his forties, was arrested last night after he murdered 19-year-old Lalita in their Sultanpuri house, police said. 

 The man (Nandan) has admitted to the murder. He broke down in front of us, investigating officer Ravinder Singh said. 

 He told the police that Lalita, a call centre employee, was intimately involved with a man and neighbours had spotted them in a compromising position. He told us that ever since the neighbours spotted the girl with her boyfriend, they started taunting Nandan about Lalitas sexual escapades, Singh said. 

 Nandan said the jeering embarrassed him to the point where he decided to kill her. 

 According to PTI, Nandan had yesterday registered a complaint claiming his daughter had not returned from work, after which police began a probe. The agency added that Lalitas mother had died last year and Nandan had remarried over his daughters objections.

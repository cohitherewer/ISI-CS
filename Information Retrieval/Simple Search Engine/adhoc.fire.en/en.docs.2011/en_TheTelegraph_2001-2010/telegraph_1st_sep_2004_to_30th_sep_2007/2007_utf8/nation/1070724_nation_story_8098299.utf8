 Modi rath set to roll again

 BASANT RAWAT 

 Narendra Modi

Ahmedabad, July 23: Each time trouble comes calling on Narendra Modi, he falls back on his pet pastime: he sets the rath rolling.

 Days after BJP rebels threw egg in his face by cross-voting for Pratibha Patil as President, the Gujarat chief minister has decided to hop on to his rath again, possibly to ensure matters dont get further out of hand before the year-end Assembly elections.

 Modi will kick off his yatra atop his modern-age luxury chariot an imported Volvo bus equipped with a digital screen to tom-tom his achievements on Independence Day.

 Sources close to Modi said the rath would roll through every village in 45 tribal-dominated talukas of eastern Gujarat and the nearly 1,600km coastal belt peopled by Koli fishermen before it draws to a stop on September 10.

 Three Volvo buses are being imported for the yatra at a cost of Rs 2 crore. They are likely to be more technologically advanced than the Swaraj Mazda Modi used for the hugely successful yatra before the 2002 polls.

 The sources said the idea was to go in for a replay of the 2002 yatra to ensure there was a rerun of the election results. Modi had won the Assembly polls that year with a massive majority.

 Modi intends to work his charm on the tribals and the Kolis as these two communities apart from the powerful Patels will determine which party comes out on top in the elections. He has already announced a Rs 28,000-crore package for their welfare. A Modi loyalist said: It is time for us to reach out to the people and win their goodwill.

 Rumblings of discontent against Modi were heard in Surat today. Over 100 members of the Leuva Patel community were detained for protesting against pro-Modi ministers and BJP state chief Purushottam Rupala who were addressing a convention in Varachha, considered Keshubhai Patels stronghold.

 Modi is also believed to have plans for another yatra closer to the elections, during which he will tour the whole state.

 Cross-voters axed

 The BJP today suspended five Gujarat MLAs for voting in favour of Pratibha Patil, but spokesperson Prakash Javadekar sought to play down the link between the cross-voting and the suspensions.

 The BJP, in a statement, cited breach of discipline as the reason for the move. Our message is loud and clear. Indiscipline will not be tolerated, Javadekar said.

 The suspended MLAs are Dhirubhai Gajera, one of the most vocal in criticising Modi ahead of the presidential poll, Gordhan Zadaphia, Balubhai Tanti, Becharbhai Bhadani and Bavkubhai Undhad.

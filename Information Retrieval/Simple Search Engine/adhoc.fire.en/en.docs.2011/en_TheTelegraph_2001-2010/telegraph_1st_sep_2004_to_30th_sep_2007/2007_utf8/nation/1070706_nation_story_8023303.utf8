 Singur salve on Mamata

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Mamata

 New Delhi, July 5: The Prime Minister today said he shared Mamata Banerjees sense of agony and anguish over the violence in Nandigram and Singur.

 What happened in these parts of West Bengal should never have happened anywhere, Manmohan Singh told a group of women journalists at his residence in response to their questions.

 The Left, which props up the Congress-led government at the Centre, may not read too much into these remarks. Theres little else a Prime Minister can be expected to say when asked about incidents such as police firing on villagers or the rape and murder of a young woman.

 Besides, Singh, whose party is eyeing a tie-up with Trinamul in the 2009 general election, would want to keep Mamata happy.

 The Prime Minister was more cautious when asked if he would accept Mamatas demand made at their meeting this week for repeal of the land-acquisition law and return of the acquired land.

 There are established state structures. I did agree to consider her suggestions. But who am I to agree or disagree to acceding to her demands? We will examine her suggestions within the framework of (the) law, he said.

 Asked about the controversy over land acquisition for special economic zones, Singh recalled that when he was deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, it had drawn up a plan on land use that was relevant to the issue.

 As far as SEZs are concerned, we will do nothing to destroy the fertile lands because we are alert to the consequences of large-scale displacement of settled communities.

 Although industrialisation is important for a developed country, Singh said, the rehabilitation policy should give farmers a stake in the industries that come up on their land.

 Asked about the Congresss relations with the Left, the Prime Minister said, We have co-existed and cohabited for three years. Out of this experience there will arise a new co-operation.

 He felt that the Congress, a newcomer to coalition politics, had managed the United Progressive Alliance well.

 He said that three years ago, when his government was born, a lot of people said we were not well equipped to handle coalition politics. But we have not done badly at all.

 Our cabinet meets almost every week. It has stalwarts from other parties but we never had problems. The smooth running of the cabinet system is testimony to the functioning of our coalition government. And I hope these five years will produce a new climate of cooperation.

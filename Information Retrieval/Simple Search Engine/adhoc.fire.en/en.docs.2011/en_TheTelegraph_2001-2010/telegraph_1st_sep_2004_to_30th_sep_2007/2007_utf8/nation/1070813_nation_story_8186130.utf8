 Shell alert in Kashmir blaze zone

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Aug. 12: The blaze in Kashmirs largest ammunition depot is refusing to die, and the villagers who fled their homes yesterday have been asked to stay away as unexploded shells may have landed around the site.

 A fire broke out in the armys 21 Field Ordinance Depot at Khundroo in south Kashmir yesterday morning, killing two civilians, injuring 20 and displacing thousands of villagers living nearby. 

 South Kashmir DIG H.K. Lohia said no explosions were heard in the late afternoon although columns of smoke were billowing. The fire raged through the night and much of the day today, but the flames had ebbed by evening.

 The depot is not just the biggest in the state but also one of the oldest, and was used by the erstwhile Dogra army.

 Peer Mohammad Hussein, a minister in Jammu and Kashmirs coalition government, said there could be unexploded shells in the dozen villages lying within 3km of the depot. Nearly 15,000 villagers have left. They have been told not to return till the area is cleared of the explosive stuff. They have been told not to touch any object lying on the ground, Hussein said.

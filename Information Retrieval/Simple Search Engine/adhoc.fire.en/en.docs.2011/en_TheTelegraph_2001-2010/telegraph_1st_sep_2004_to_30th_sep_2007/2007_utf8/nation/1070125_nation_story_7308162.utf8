 NY couple found dead

 Syosset, New York, (AP): An Indian-origin couple were yesterday found dead in their home by their young sons.

 Nassau county police identified the victims as Jaspal Singh, 46, and Geeta Singh, 38.

 When their sons, Josh, 13, and Ankur, 12, came home from school, no one answered the doorbell, the police said. The boys used a spare key to get in and found their parents lying dead in the bedroom.

 They ran to alert a neighbour, said Michael Moore, 13, who lives across the street. They were saying, How could this happen to us? he said.

 Neighbours said the family, originally from Punjab, had moved into the home less than a year ago from the New York City borough of Queens. 

 A family friend, Raj Maini, said the couple had emigrated 18 years ago. 

 Jaspal had a gas station and a small retail business in Manhattan. 

 Its just crazy. I cant believe it. He was such a good man, Maini said.

 The police said the children were staying with relatives. The motive behind the murders is not known, they added.

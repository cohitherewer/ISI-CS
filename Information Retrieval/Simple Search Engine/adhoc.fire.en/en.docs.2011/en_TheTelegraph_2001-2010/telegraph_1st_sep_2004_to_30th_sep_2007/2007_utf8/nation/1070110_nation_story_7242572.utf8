 Cold spell tells on Delhi schools

 - Chill to continue for another week, says Met office

 All wrapped up

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: Temperatures across much of the northern region will continue to stay at least three degrees below normal over the next week, officials of the Indian Meteorological Department said here today. For children in primary or pre-primary schools in Delhi, that will translate into an extended winter vacation.

 Faced with plunging temperatures in the capital, the Delhi government has asked schools to shut down their primary and pre-primary sections for at least a week. 

 While central and state government schools in the capital will have to remain shut till January 16, private schools have been issued a directive by the Delhi governments directorate of education asking them to follow suit.

 No action will be taken against schools which decide to stay open. However, if anything happens to a child, they will face action, Delhi education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely told The Telegraph. Lovely also said the order could be renewed on January 16, if the cold spell continues.

 Met department officials have warned the western disturbances that are keeping temperatures sub-normal may continue beyond January 16. Across north India, temperatures will stay between three and five degrees centigrade below normal till the middle of the month, Rajesh Parmar, a scientist at the department, said. Northern Punjab and western Rajasthan will see temperatures around zero, he added. 

 The news isnt good for passengers travelling in and out of Delhi fog and mist will persist over the next few days. 

 Most schools in the capital had to close for at least 10 working days in the past three months because of traders protests against the sealing drive. Principals of some private schools are now concerned there might not be enough time to complete the curriculum. How are junior students going to complete their curriculum this way? said Jyotsna Kashyap, principal of Daisydales, a primary school. By evening, most school principles seemed to have accepted the partial shutdown directive.

 Delhi Public School (RK Puram), Sanskriti School, Summer Fields and others schools have decided to suspend primary classes till further orders from the government. 

 We thought the government had asked the entire school to shut down. That would have been a huge problem. Closing primary schools is comparatively all right, said Shyama Chona, principal of DPS (RK Puram). 

 Pre-board examinations for students in Class X and XII are now under way in most schools. Principals were concerned students would not have enough time before their board examinations if the pre-boards are postponed.

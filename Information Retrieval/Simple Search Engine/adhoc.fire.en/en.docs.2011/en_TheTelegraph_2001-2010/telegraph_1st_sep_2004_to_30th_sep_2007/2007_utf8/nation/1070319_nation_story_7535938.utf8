 Buddha meets governor

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 18: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee tonight called on governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi at Raj Bhavan to discuss the Nandigram situation.

 Raj Bhavan sources said Bhattacharjee, who reached Raj Bhavan around 6.15 this evening, was closeted with Gandhi for nearly an hour. 

 This was Bhattacharjees first meeting with Gandhi after the governor issued a public statement virtually indicting the government for Wednesdays police firing in Nandigram.

 The chief minister reportedly expressed regret for the police firing but said he could not comprehend the scale of agitation by villagers. 

 He also briefed Gandhi about the governments decision not to acquire any land in Nandigram for industry.

 During the meeting, Gandhi is believed to have asked Bhattacharjee to ensure that the injured get proper medical care and attention in state-run hospitals.

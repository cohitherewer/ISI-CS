 New Delhi, Jan. 22: Private and foreign education providers will have no autonomy if the CPM has its way.

 The Marxists are strengthening human resource development minister Arjun Singhs hand against the commerce ministry and the lobby which wants the Centre to have a flexible system for private and foreign education providers.

 Ironically, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has been calling for more autonomy to institutions of higher education. His party, however, wants tighter control over all institutions.

 A delegation of the Students Federation of India (SFI), led by CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury, today met the Prime Minister, handing a list of demands that could make the entry and functioning of foreign and private education providers in India as difficult as possible.

 The HRD ministry has been engaged in a tussle with the commerce ministry on the same matter. The CPM is giving the go-ahead to the HRD minister to stick to his stand. The Prime Minister, it is well known, does not for the most part agree with the arguments given either by colleague Arjun or ally Yechury.

 Yechury wants the Centre to institute a regulator that will supervise the functioning of private institutions not just in terms of their entry but will also decide their fee structure and the mode of admission. The CPM wants all private institutions to have the quota regime that is applicable in government institutions.

 At present, the private institutions are outside the reservation framework. The Centre is planning a bill that will make the quota mandatory for unaided deemed universities under the Centre. The bill will not affect private institutions in the states. It is up to the state government to enact quota laws if they want the private institutions to abide by the reservation mandate.

 The CPM is not content just with a strict control over fees and admission. It also wants the Centre to vet the curriculum of the private institutions and to decide the salary structure of teachers. 

 One of the main charges of the CPM against the entry of foreign providers is they have no concept of Indian ethos and culture and their curriculum will be unsuitable for Indian students.

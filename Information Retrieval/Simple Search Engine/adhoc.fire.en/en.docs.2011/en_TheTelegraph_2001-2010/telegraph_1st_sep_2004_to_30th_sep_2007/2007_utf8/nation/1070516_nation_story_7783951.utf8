 Indian Net tutors for UK pupils

 London, May 15 (PTI): Indian tutors can now provide round-the-clock Internet tuition to British students for a fee.

 After its success in the US, Tutorvista, the Internet-based Indian tuition business, today entered into a partnership with Britains Letts Revision Guides to provide online tuition to British students.

 Using an interactive whiteboard, text and voice chat, tutors based in India will provide 24-hours-a-day tuition to British students. The subscription costs 49.99 a month for unlimited sessions, a price the company says makes it a non-elitist product.

 You pay 35 to 50 an hour in London and you have to be available for the tutor, said Tutorvistas UK manager Martin Baker. The whole idea of the model is that it becomes as natural as paying your satellite TV subscription.

 He told the Guardian it is the scale that makes Tutorvista able to undercut British tutors. 

 The Indian company has 500 tutors on its books and is adding 150 to 200 a month. It has the capacity to add 500 a month.

 Spy-stung RAW goes back to school

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 20: Hit by an embarrassing defection of a key officer, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), Indias external intelligence agency, is preparing to retrain its spies.

 RAWs Gurgaon-based training institute will soon adopt a new training module, which will be based on the recommendations of a group of experts. The experts were recently employed to point out shortcomings in the training of the cadre in the wake of the rapidly changing security environment.

 Sources said the recommendations made by the experts have been accepted and would be implemented soon. The agency wants to maintain a quality check on its officers to prevent any breach.

 The redesigning of the training module is part of a series of steps taken to plug holes in the agency and prevent any more defections. Much to the embarrassment of the agency, a joint secretary-level official, Rabinder Singh, fled to the US after leaking secret information to the CIA.

 RAW agents have been on a hunt for Singh, believed to be living in the US. After non-bailable warrants against him were issued, the agency is planning to seek his extradition. Sources said Singh was traced to the US and pressure would be built through diplomatic channels to bring him back.

 Singh has been charged with treason and a trial is on in a Delhi court. He has also been booked under the Official Secrets Act as he allegedly passed on confidential documents to a foreign intelligence agency. He worked as joint secretary (Southeast Asia) and is believed to have fled to Nepal before reaching the US.

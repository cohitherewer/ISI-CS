 Bills to aid women put on hold

 OUR BUREAU 

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: Two bills meant to help women hit the wall today with ministers raising objections.

 Changes to the immoral trafficking act that would have penalised clients of sex workers were put on hold. Some ministers said there was a need to clearly define the term client.

 The other deferred bill proposed to make the anti-sati law more stringent by making the entire community accountable.

 One of the questions thrown up apparently was about the future of a 500-year-old sati temple and how the law would affect the visit of thousands to the temple every year.

 The cabinet was today unable to take up the rehabilitation policy for those displaced by land acquisition for industry as it spent more time than scheduled on education and old-age pension for the poor.

 Officials said the rehabilitation policy is now likely to be taken up at the next cabinet meeting.

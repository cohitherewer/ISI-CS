 Kajra Re, the most wanted

 The Bachchans and Ash perform Kajra Re in the film

 Mumbai, April 20: Aishwarya Rais kaare kaare naina have set many a heart aflutter, and the Bachchans sure cant get enough of them.

 Kajra Re the hit number that had Abhishek Bachchan and Ash shaking a leg with Amitabh in Bunty Aur Babli has become the unofficial theme song of the AbAsh wedding.

 The song was performed thrice at the sangeet on Wednesday night.

 Yes, it was played over and over again on public demand. Mr Bachchan himself came on the stage and jammed with us for Kajra Re, said Ehsaan Noorani of Shankar Ehsaan Loy, who composed the song and performed at the sangeet.

 AbAsh tangoed to another Shankar Ehsaan Loy song, Tujhe aaj maine jo dekha, from Kuch Na Kaho starring the couple.

 But the whistles and cheers were reserved for the song of the ceremony. 

 On screen, the song shows Ashs character flirting with Amitabh rather than Abhishek Bachchan Senior even tells her: Madam, I am your only Adam. But on the sangeet night, the son stole the show as he lip-synced Kajra Re and danced with his bride-to-be. It is not known, however, if he stole papas line as well.

 Last night at Jalsa, after the mehendi at Aishwaryas Bandra flat, the song was back on the dance floor.

 When Abhishek was leaving Jalsa to bring his bride home, the band stuck to the Kajra Re tune. At the wedding, too, the light-eyed Ashs kohl-lined kaare kaare naina (dark eyes) were being celebrated.

 Shilpa at SC door

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 14: Actress Shilpa Shetty today moved the Supreme Court seeking transfer to Mumbai of three cases levelling obscenity charges against her for the controversial kiss with Richard Gere.

 Shilpa (in picture), who is apprehending arrest, also sought an interim stay on criminal proceedings in courts at Jaipur and Mundawar in Rajasthan and Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh which had summoned her.

 Shilpas advocate said his client, who had become the cultural ambassador of India after winning Celebrity Big Brother, was being harassed by people looking for publicity.

 Although his client had not received the summons formally, the complainants, all of them lawyers, were planning to press for arrest warrants on the ground that Shilpa had ignored the summons, he said.

 Himesh in burqa row

 Ajmer, June 27: She fell far short of the standard, while he may have covered up more than he should have.

 Himesh Reshammiya, the musician many love to hate, arrived at Ajmers Khawaja Moinuddhin Chishti dargah in a burqa last night. 

 Although he said he did so to avoid the crowd and apologised later, many at the shrine werent prepared to bring down the curtains on the row.

 In October last year, Katrina Kaif had irked shrine authorities when she shot some sequences of Namaste London Himesh had scored the music for this movie in a short skirt. The actress, along with director Vipul Shah and other members of the crew, were served show-cause notices and asked to apologise. 

 With Himesh, at least some among the authorities are behind him. He is a popular artiste and if he wore a burqa to avoid the crowd, he has not committed a sin, said Sarwar Chisti, spokesman for the Anjuman Committee of the shrines khadims (servers).

 The music director-turned-singer had arrived with four others to seek blessings for the success of Aap Ka Suroor, the Friday release in which he debuts as an actor.

 The fuss started after murmurs of protest from some people who came to know that Himesh had arrived in a veil.

 The 34-year-old composer of chartbusters like Tere Naam and Aashiq Banaya Aapne claimed Qutubuddhin Saki, a khadim at the shrine, advised him to wear the burqa. But if I have made a mistake, I apologise, he said as he came out after offering prayers.

 Saki said: What is wrong with it? It was done to save him from the public. There is no controversy.

 But dargah committee president Peerzda Sibali Qasim said Himesh could have avoided wearing a burqa. If he had informed them in advance they could have managed ziyaarat for him.

 If any untoward or unruly incident had happened with the singer, who could then be held responsible? Sibali asked. The dargah committee can manage ziyaarat for high-profile personalities, including Presidents of various nations and celebrities, he added.

 In Islam, whether a man can wear a burqa or not is a subject that needs to be decided by mullahs and maulvis. We are not saying whatever he has done is right or wrong, but any celebrity or public figure can avoid such things by organising his or her trips in advance and informing the dargah committee, Sibali said.

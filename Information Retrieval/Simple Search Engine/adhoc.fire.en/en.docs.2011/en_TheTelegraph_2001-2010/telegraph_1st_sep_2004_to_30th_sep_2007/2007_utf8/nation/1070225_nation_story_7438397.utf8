 NRI sues British govt

 London, Feb. 24 (PTI): An Indian-origin interpreter and an Iran-born female colleague have taken the British government to court for paying them to do nothing for 15 years and thereby ruining their careers.

 Marti Khan and Odette King, both British nationals, are claiming over $2.9 million as damages, accusing immigration officials of failing to utilise their services properly.

 Both were paid 25,000 per annum to translate for new arrivals at Heathrow airport. They claimed immigration managers failed to reassign their duties after the home office started outsourcing translation jobs to freelance interpreters in 1990.

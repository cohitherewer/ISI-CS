 CPM kicks up tax sop stink

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, April 6: The CPM leadership is trying to heal Nandigram wounds by punching holes in the Centres revised policy on special economic zones (SEZ). 

 The party has voiced unhappiness at the changes finalised by a group of ministers to the SEZ Act, saying it will raise the unresolved problems in Parliament. The second half of the budget session resumes on April 26. 

 The biggest objection is to the fact that exorbitant and unjustified tax concessions have been retained. The concern is that these will mean a huge revenue loss. The tax bonanza was one of the basic problems with the SEZ Act. By keeping this, the government stands to lose tens of thousands of crores, the party said.

 Another sticking point is the provision that does away with the role of states in land acquisition. The CPM doesnt agree with states not being involved in land acquisition, particularly for large SEZs, the party said. 

 There are also fears that direct negotiations with companies will make peasants easy prey to land sharks. Private entities will be able to own, rather than lease, thousands of acres, subverting the land ceiling and town planning laws, the CPM politburo said. In Nandigram, however, state intervention had deepened, not diminished, resistance from those losing land.

 Concerns about the size are also high. The party feels the ceiling of 12,500 acres for multi-product SEZs is too high and says no more than 5,000 acres should be allowed.

 The SEZ concept will not find acceptance without revising tax concessions. The government has ignored the recommendations made by Left parties, the party complained. 

 The party left little doubt that the proposed amendments to the SEZ Act wont be enough to ensure its adoption. 

 The changes suggested by the group of ministers fall short of what is required, the politburo said. 

 For now, the party wants the Centre to wait for the recommendations of a parliamentary committee on commerce. 

 The government should re-examine the whole matter rather than make piecemeal suggestions, the politburo said. 

 The outcry over land acquisition forced the government to put all SEZ approvals on hold. Yesterday, however, the empowered group of ministers sanctioned 83 SEZ projects. But these were ones that have no land problems and had received formal approval earlier.

 By declaring the changes inadequate, the CPM, under fire for the way its government in Bengal tried to acquire land for a chemical hub to be built by the Salim group, wants to undo some of the damage. Last year, it had sent a seven-page note on SEZ amendments to the Centre.

 Garbage in paradise

 Dal Lake: Scare in the air

 Srinagar, April 15: Srinagar is getting ready to receive tourists in the busy summer season with mounds of garbage piled up on its streets and an epidemic scare in the air. 

 Thousands of tonnes of waste is spread across the city a favourite haunt of Bengali holidaymakers after the lone dumping site at Achan for Srinagars 1.3 million residents was closed.

 People in Achan had raised a stink over the disposal of garbage in their neighbourhood. Daily protests and clashes with police this month left dozens injured and led to a temporary closure of the site.

 Shafqat A. Khan, health officer in the Srinagar Municipal Corporation, said around 2,000 metric tonnes of garbage has gathered on the streets. Water bodies, including Dal Lake, have also been affected. The collection of waste, including polythene from Dal Lake, has stopped as we have no place to dump it, he said.

 If nothing is done by tomorrow, we may have to declare a health emergency, Khan said. There is a real chance of an epidemic due to viral and droplet infection and there may be spread of hepatitis. This may harm our tourist season.

 Kashmir, also known as paradise on earth, depends heavily on tourism for its economy. The summer season is the busiest, drawing hordes of visitors from the country and abroad.

 But Achan residents argue that the waste dump has caused them grave health problems. There is no scientific disposal of waste here and this has been happening for the last 23 years. Our children are most vulnerable to the poisonous fluids that accumulate from the dump, said Nazir Ahmad Khan. 

 The corporation has approached the army to allow it to use its dumping site. 

 Several rounds of talks have been held with Achan residents, but without much progress, municipal commissioner Haq Nawaz said. They (residents) have a one-point programme. They want the site closed. 

 Nawaz admitted that there is no scientific disposal of waste in Achan.

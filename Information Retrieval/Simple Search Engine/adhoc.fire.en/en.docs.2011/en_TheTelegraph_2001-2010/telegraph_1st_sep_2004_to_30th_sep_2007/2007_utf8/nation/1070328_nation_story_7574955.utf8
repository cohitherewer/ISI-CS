 SC threat brings on khaki cover

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, March 27: That man in a black coat and white trousers standing beside you on the steps of the countrys highest court could be carrying a bomb.

 Scary, isnt it?

 And cause for worry, too, thinks the Union home ministry.

 It may not be as terrifying as that, but the ministry is taking no chances following intelligence inputs that the Supreme Court could be on the hit list of militant groups. So it is planning to introduce elaborate security arrangements on the courts campus.

 The move has come in the wake of a terrorist attack on a court in Pakistans Quetta in February this year that killed 15 people, including a senior civil judge. Intelligence agencies are also wary after the apex court upheld the death sentence of Afzal Guru, convicted in the December 2001 Parliament attack case.

 The decision to upgrade the courts security was taken at a high-level meeting Union home secretary V.K. Duggal held with top officials of the Intelligence Bureau, Delhi police, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and the justice department on March 5.

 Tomorrow, apex court judge Altamas Kabir and top officials of the home ministry and central security agencies are scheduled to meet to decide on the security blueprint the ministry has prepared.

 Officials said the ministry thinks the arrangements should be in accordance with the wishes of the court, which wants them to be non-obtrusive. We would go as per the directions of the Supreme Court as it knows best what could be obtrusive or not and which security system is best suited for its needs, said an official.

 Sources said the ministrys main worry is the huge gaps in the system to control access to the court.

 It is thronged by thousands of people everyday lawyers, including from other states, and their clients. Anybody wearing an advocates dress, a black coat, white trousers and a white band on the collar, can enter the Supreme Courts premises. Many lawyers who do not have chambers often meet clients in the corridors and even in the library, said a senior ministry official.

 The ministry wants to hand over the courts security to the CISF, which guards nearly all the vital installations in the country, including Parliament, airports, atomic centres, Taj Mahal and important government buildings.

 There would be emphasis on access and movement control with the help of non-obtrusive electronic gadgets. We are planning to issue electronic smart cards to regular Supreme Court lawyers and make some arrangement under which only verified clients can go inside, said an official.

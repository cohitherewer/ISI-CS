 Maoist landmines kill nine cops on patrol

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Raipur, May 28: Constable Ambika Marege, Baldev Netam and 10 others were on patrolling duty in Chhattisgarhs Jagalpur district this evening when Maoists triggered landmine blasts and opened fire, killing nine policemen.

 Marege, Netam and another constable who survived walked several kilometres to reach Mardapur police station in the district.

 According to Jagalpur district police chief G.P. Singh, the 12 policemen had gone patrolling on six motorcycles after they received a tip-off about a Naxalite camp. But local residents said the policemen were performing their routine duty near Kudur village when the blasts occurred. As the policemen fell helplessly, the Maoists snatched their weapons and walked away without facing any resistance, an eyewitness said.

 State home minister Ram Vichar Netam confirmed the incident but claimed that the police fired, too. He supported the Jagalpur SPs version that the police were on the offensive and had gone to bust a Naxalite camp.

 The attack comes a day after Maoists called a successful Dandakaranya bandh to protest against an alleged fake encounter at Ponjer village near Bijapur in which six persons lost their lives. During the bandh, the rebels blew up a railway bridge, triggered landmine blasts and torched property of the Essar Steel Company.

 Naxalites also damaged a railway bridge between Bacheli and Kirandul, about 425 km from Raipur. Three wagons of a goods train were derailed.

 According to Netam, the attacks were planned to prevent security forces from taking action upon receiving intelligence inputs.

 Police officials handling anti-Naxalite operations endorsed Netams line of thinking and added that the rebels walking away with the arms of slain security forces indicated they were short of arms and ammunition.

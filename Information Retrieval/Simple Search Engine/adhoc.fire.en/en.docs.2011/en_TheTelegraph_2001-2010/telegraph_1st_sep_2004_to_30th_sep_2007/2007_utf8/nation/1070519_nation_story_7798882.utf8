 Left raises pitch, Pranab seals lips

 Pranab: Non-committal

 New Delhi, May 18: More voices from the Left Front openly pitched for Pranab Mukherjee as their presidential candidate, but the foreign minister kept speculators guessing.

 An open-ended statement released by the external affairs ministry neither confirmed nor denied that he was in the running for the post.

 A number of news items have appeared in the past few days on the presidential election. These are speculative in nature. I would like to state that I am a Congressman, it said.

 Mukherjee stressed that it was the Congress leadership that decided his role in the party and the government. Whatever responsibilities are assigned to me, I try to discharge those to the best of my capabilities. 

 The Prime Minister, too, was non-committal when asked about Mukherjee on the sidelines of an official programme. Discussions are on, it is too premature. We are discussing with all the allies, he said.

 The Congresss elite Friday group comprising Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi, Ahmed Patel, Mukherjee, Shivraj Patil and A.K. Antony met at the Prime Ministers residence this evening for its weekly meeting. Congress sources said they were expected to run through the developments on the presidential poll front.

 The sources admitted that the party had been put in a tight spot by the Lefts relentless campaign for Mukherjee.

 Today in Midnapore, CPI leader A.B. Bardhan was quoted by agencies as saying he wanted a President who was well-versed with the Constitution, the political and the social aspects of the country and is, above all, a secular person. 

 As Mukherjee scores well on all these points, the Congress brass has been reluctant to relieve him from the government and the party. But the UPA governments record shows that once the Left ups the ante on a major issue, the Congress usually falls in line, a source said.

 However, the Congress is miffed with the Left for speaking ahead of time. It is a matter of form. The Congress is a stickler for propriety and procedure and will never go public on anything without completing the required consultations, a source said.

 There were reports that former Uttarakhand chief minister N.D. Tiwari had hinted to his confidants in the Congress that he was ready to move into Rashtrapati Bhavan with 10 Janpaths nod. 

 Congress treasurer and Uttarakhand in-charge Motilal Vora refused to confirm this. Tiwariji had sought time from Madam (Sonia) for May 13 or 14. But he has not got it so far. Had he come to Delhi, I would be the first to know, he said.

 Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, on the other hand, is believed to be working overtime to garner goodwill and votes in his favour. He has spoken to Sharad Pawar of the Nationalist Congress Party and leaders of the DMK and the PMK.

 Singh not keen on Sidhu seat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 15: The Prime Minister is disinclined to contest the Lok Sabha bypoll from Amritsar despite invitations from Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and the state Congress.

 The seat was vacated by the BJPs Navjot Singh Sidhu after he was convicted of causing a mans death in a road-rage brawl.

 Punjab Congress chief Shamsher Singh Dullo, at a joint news conference with Amarinder here today, said that about 10 days ago, he had requested Manmohan Singh to consider contesting from Amritsar. But the Prime Minister indicated that neither he nor his relatives will fight (from Punjab).

 The Prime Ministers step-brother had recently declared he wanted to contest the Assembly polls as a Congress candidate but was stopped in his tracks by Manmohan Singh.

 A senior Congress official said there was no move in Delhi to field the Prime Minister from Amritsar.

 Manmohan Singhs term in the Rajya Sabha, to which he was elected from Assam, expires in July.

 The Punjab Congress believes that having the Prime Minister contest a Lok Sabha seat from the state would improve its own prospects in the Assembly polls, helping it weather any anti-incumbency sentiment.

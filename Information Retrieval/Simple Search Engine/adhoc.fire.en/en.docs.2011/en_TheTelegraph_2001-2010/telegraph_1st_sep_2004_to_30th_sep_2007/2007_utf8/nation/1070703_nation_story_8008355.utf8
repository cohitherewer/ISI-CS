 Epic touch to President race

 New Delhi, July 2 (PTI): After ghosts, its time for divine intervention. But sadly for Mohan Ramayani, it hasnt worked.

 The presidential race contender from Madhya Pradeshs Datiya has got none other than almighty Ram to propose his candidature. And, if that wasnt enough, his nomination took on epic proportions when officials poring over his papers found that he had Ravans support as well. 

 Ramayani, who clearly takes his name very seriously, has managed to achieve what religion and mythology havent unite Ram and Ravan for a purpose.

 And the purpose is no ordinary one. After all, Pratibha Patil, the UPA-Left contender, has spoken of her conversations with the spirit of a sect founder in which she was told about a great responsibility coming her way.

 But Ramayani, who listed Sita, Bharat, Shatrughan and Dashrath as the other backers, was told his papers werent good enough. Lok Sabha secretary-general P.D.T. Achary must have been a brave man to spike the papers, knowing full well that Ramayani, who also had Kumbhakarna and Meghnad behind him, is no ordinary contestant.

 Besides Pratibha and NDA-backed Independent Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, the only other person to have marshalled over 50 signatures in support was Narendra Nath Dubey Adig the suffix meaning unshakeable.

 But the Varanasi contender whose name is synonymous with resolute will could not prevent his own signature from straying. 

 His papers were tossed out because his signature didnt match the Election Commissions specimen. Adig was disqualified in the previous presidential elections on similar grounds.

 Asked how non-serious candidates could be kept out of the fray, Achary said certain provisions of law must be changed to tackle the problem. Under the existing set of laws, Achary said even if a candidate doesnt have 50 individuals backing him and as many seconding his candidature, his nomination papers have to be accepted. 

 All that a contender has to do is provide a certified copy of the electoral roll showing he is a voter. This needs to be amended and Parliament can do it, Achary said.

 The documents, including those filed by Ramayani and Adig, will be sent to the poll panel, which will examine cases of forged signatures and other dubious aspects. But some in the country might already be thanking God for the entertainment.

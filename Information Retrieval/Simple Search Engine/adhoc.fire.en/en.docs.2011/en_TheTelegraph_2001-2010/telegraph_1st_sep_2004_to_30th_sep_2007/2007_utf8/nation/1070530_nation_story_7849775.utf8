 Dausa, May 29: Brandishing a thick tree trunk menacingly, Rajinder Baisla walks up to each approaching car, followed by a team of about 20 youth none empty-handed. 

 Turn back. The road ends here for you, he says, thumping the trunk against his left palm. 

 With no sign of the administration, Baisla is clearly in command. The vehicles dutifully turn around. 

 Its 5.30 pm and Baislas post beyond Dausa is well within the 50-km stretch on the Jaipur-Agra highway that is completely out of the administrations control. 

 On the outskirts of Jaipur, Rahul Mahajan, the superintendent of police (Dausa), barks out instructions to a joint team of the army, police and paramilitary forces in military style. 

 Its already been over six hours that this territory has been out of our control. Soon itll get dark and well be vulnerable to surprise attacks. We have to launch the assault.

 Now. 

 To his right, an officer of the Intelligence Bureau jokes about whether he will face flak for a failure, then turns to his phone to resume contact with officers on the other side of the blocked stretch. 

 You know this kind of situation the administration locked out of territory well, dont you, he winks at this correspondent, referring to Nandigram. 

 By 6 pm, 50 trucks, vans and jeeps carrying officers of the army, police and the Rapid Action Force have lined up behind Mahajans white Ambassador. 

 What follows could be out of West Asia. For three-and-a-half hours, the security forces battle against civilian protesters tear gas shells lobbing towards Agra, stones towards Jaipur. 

 The tear gas wins, and with a war-like efficiency, the convoy of vehicles belonging to the security forces ploughs its way through enemy territory. 

 By 10.30 pm, the Jaipur-Agra highway has been re-claimed by the administration, but the battle is far from over. 

 Large segments of the Delhi-Jaipur highway are still out of bounds for vehicles and the administration. 

 That, Mahajan says, is tomorrows battle.

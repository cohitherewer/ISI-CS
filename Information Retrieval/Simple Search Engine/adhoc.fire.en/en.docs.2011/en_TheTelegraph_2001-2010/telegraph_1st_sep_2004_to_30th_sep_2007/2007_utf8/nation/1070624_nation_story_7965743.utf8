 Chandigarh, June 23: The town that lost its most famous face in the Colombia disaster seemed to exorcise its demons as Sunita Willams made a safe landing aboard space shuttle Atlantis last night.

 Kalpana Chawlas hometown Karnal distributed sweets today, celebrating younger daughter Sunitas feat.

 Its a proud moment for all Indians. At our school, we have been praying constantly for Sunita after learning of the snag on the Atlantis, Tagore Bal Niketan principal Rajan Lamba said from Karnal.

 We are thankful that the prayers of the children have been answered.

 Atlantiss thermal blanket had developed a tear in space, raising fears of a Colombia re-run. A heat tile had fallen off Kalpanas space shuttle, exposing it to searing heat during re-entry into Earths atmosphere on February 1, 2003.

 Kalpana died with six other astronauts when the spacecraft disintegrated 16 minutes before it was to land at Cape Canaveral in Florida.

 For most in the school, the last few minutes before Atlantis re-entered the atmosphere were tense. Divya Jyoti and Ankush Bishnoi, two students selected by the US space agency Nasa for its summer camp beginning next month, were up till the small hours to watch the landing on television.

 So far, 18 students from the school have taken part in Nasa camps, thanks largely to Kalpana. She had impressed on her seniors in Nasa to invite students from her school, and the practice has survived her.

 I would like to speak to Suniji (Sunita) about Kalpana didi. Its only through her eyes that we can know how Kalpana didi felt in space and what she must have gone through when she realised something was wrong, Divya said.

 Kalpanas father B.D. Chawla said Sunita had not only made India but the whole world proud.

 She is like a chhoti (small) Kalpana for the whole family and just like Kalpana, has made everybody in the country proud, he said.

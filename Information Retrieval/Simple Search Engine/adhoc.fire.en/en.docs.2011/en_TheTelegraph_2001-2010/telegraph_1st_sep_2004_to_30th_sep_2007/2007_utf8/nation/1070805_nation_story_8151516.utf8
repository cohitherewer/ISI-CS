 Justice comes to Haryana doorstep

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Aug. 4: Residents of Haryana, in areas bordering Delhi, will now have the luxury of justice being delivered at their doorstep.

 The countrys first mobile court was inaugurated by Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan at Punhana in Mewat district today.

 The functioning of a mobile court in an economically, educationally and socially backward area of Mewat marks the beginning of a new revolution in the Indian judiciary. It will go a long way in providing speedy and inexpensive justice to the poor people of this area, Balakrishnan said.

 The court-on-wheels has been set up in a specially designed air-conditioned bus. It has a courtroom, a retiring room for the presiding judge, computers, cabinets for books and seats for 10 persons. 

 Presided over by an additional civil judge (senior division), the court will receive civil and criminal applications, grant bail, remand accused in custody, issue summons, receive police reports, record evidence and pronounce decrees and judgments. It will also deliver certified copies of its rulings, sentences and verdicts.

 Balakrishnan said unless speedy and inexpensive justice was ensured to every person, the judicial system would remain incomplete.

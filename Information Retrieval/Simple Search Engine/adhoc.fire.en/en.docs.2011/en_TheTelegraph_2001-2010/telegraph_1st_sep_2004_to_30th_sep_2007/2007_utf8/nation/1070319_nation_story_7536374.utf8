 Jairam sees no SEZ link

 Ramesh: Stress on unity

 Calcutta, March 18: A central minister believes the Nandigram bloodspill had nothing to do with special economic zones (SEZ), but asked Bengal to assure investors quickly that a socially sustainable model of industrialisation will be followed.

 The Union minister of state for commerce and industry, Jairam Ramesh, said last weeks violence could prove a psychological setback if the reassurance doesnt come through. However, he felt it would be wrong to blame the ugly turn of events on the push for special zones.

 What happened at Nandigram shouldnt be attributed to the SEZ model or the process of industrialisation. Its a political problem and should be dealt with accordingly. The CBI will, hopefully, bring out the truth, Ramesh said.

 The minister, on a visit to the city, asserted that the Centre has not notified any SEZ in Nandigram, saying the bloodshed was the result of political culture of confrontation and violence in the state. 

 Ramesh urged all parties to work together and reach out to people who need help.

 He spoke highly of Tata Motors Singur project, saying it would have a multiplier effect the economic term used when one big industry boosts incomes and lures fresh investment in a host of other businesses. 

 The plant, Ramesh said, could pitchfork the eastern and north-eastern regions to the forefront of industrial development.

 It is important for the people of the entire region that it is set up in Bengal. But different projects require to be handled in a different manner. What is true for Singur might not be right for Nandigram, the minister said.

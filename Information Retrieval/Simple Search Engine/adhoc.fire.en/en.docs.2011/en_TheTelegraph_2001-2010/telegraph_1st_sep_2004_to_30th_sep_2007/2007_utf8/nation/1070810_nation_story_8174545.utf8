 Gulmarg on market

 MUZAFFAR RAINA

 Srinagar, Aug. 9: Land sale at Gulmarg, put on ice last year after protests, is being revived but with changes to make sure it does not run into rough weather again.

 Our ministry has already formulated the fresh proposal and it will now go to the cabinet for approval this month itself, state tourism minister Dilawar Mir said. This time, the land will be offered to Kashmiris alone.

 The key objection when the plan was stalled last October was the provision that allowed outsiders to participate in tourism projects to be built on land leased to local groups.

 The states land grants act allows a 99-year lease for both residents and outsiders, but non-Kashmiris have rarely been allotted land. Local residents have over the years taken small plots on lease. But the 70 acres proposed to be offered last year would have been the biggest-ever auction.

 The decision was aimed at generating funds and building better-quality tourism facilities at the resort, a must-see for all tourists in Kashmir. Allowing outsiders to bid would have ensured higher bids but the plan was dropped. 

 Opposition parties, civil society groups and militant outfits were among those who had put up a strong resistance. 

 Hizb-ul Mujahideen had even threatened outsiders with dire consequences if they participated in the process.

 To avoid trouble, the government is treading with caution. We are looking forward to world-class infrastructure and we are leasing land to state subjects for it. No allotments will be made to outsiders, Mir said.

 The minimum price has been fixed at Rs 15 lakh per kanal (about an eighth of an acre) for the 62.5 acres that will be offered at Leopard Valley in the well-known resort.

 Last year, too, the government had claimed that the sale was meant exclusively for the Kashmiris but its notification left room for outsiders, sparking the outcry.

 The fresh proposal being drawn up will leave no scope for joint ventures that includes non-Kashmiris, Mir said.

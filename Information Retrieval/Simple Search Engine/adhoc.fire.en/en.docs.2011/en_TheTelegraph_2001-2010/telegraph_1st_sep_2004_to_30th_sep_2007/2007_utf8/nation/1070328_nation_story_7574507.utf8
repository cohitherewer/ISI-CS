 Pak terror suspects sold to US: Amnesty

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 27: Pakistan authorities and villagers have been cashing in on the war on terror by selling alleged terror suspects to the US, an Amnesty International report released today said.

 The human rights watchdog has alleged that terror suspects apprehended in Pakistan were being secretly handed over to the US for a price without formal extradition procedures.

 Over 85 per cent of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay had not been arrested by US forces but had been secured by paying rewards of up to $5,000, it added.

 The routine practice of offering large rewards for unidentified terror suspects has facilitated arbitrary detention and forced disappearance. Many individuals were arrested by Pakistan police or border officials, army personnel, or captured by local people, and handed over to US law enforcement or intelligence personnel in exchange for a reward, the report said.

 Although Pakistan has formally denied such transfers, an Amnesty official said President Pervez Musharraf had admitted in his autobiography that the country had made money by handing prisoners to the US.

 We have captured 689 and handed over 369 to the United States. We have earned bounties totalling millions of dollars. Those who habitually accuse us of not doing enough in the war on terror should simply ask the CIA how much prize money it has paid to the government of Pakistan, he quoted Musharraf as saying on page 266 of In the Line of Fire: A Memoir.

 Amnesty said a majority of detainees had to be released as no charges were found against them.

 A UK national, Jamal Belmar, told Amnesty after his release from Guantanamo Bay that he was sold by villagers to the Pakistani Army which, in turn, sold him to the Americans in December 2001.

 A Moroccan victim, quoted in the report, described men with black suitcases (US agents) as arriving at a detention centre in Pakistan and bargaining over prisoners. A clap by both parties meant the deal had been sealed.

 Amnesty said the clandestine nature of the war on terror made it impossible to ascertain exactly how many had been arbitrarily arrested.

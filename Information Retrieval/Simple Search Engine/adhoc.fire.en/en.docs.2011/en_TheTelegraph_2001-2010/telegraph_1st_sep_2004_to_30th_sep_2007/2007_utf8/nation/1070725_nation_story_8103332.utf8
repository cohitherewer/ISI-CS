 New Delhi, July 24: During his five-year tenure as President, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam nearly made it till the moon, while his website drew three visitors every second. 

 Kalam criss-crossed the nation in an itinerary so tight sometimes hopping into three towns in a day that, taking into account his foreign visits, he has travelled about 3,84,000km, the distance from Earth to the moon. 

 Along the way, he delivered speeches to school students and business leaders, to former fellow scientists and village folk, to religious leaders and soldiers on Siachen Glacier and sailors inside a submarine often with themes that recurred again and again in speech after speech.

 For instance, over the past year, he has referred to the concept of Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas over 80 times in various speeches, including one delivered to defence staff and officers at Wellington, Tamil Nadu. 

 When Kalam couldnt travel, he delivered speeches via videoconferences facilitated by a multimedia studio set up at Rashtrapati Bhavan sometimes engaging in conversations with the audience. 

 Earlier this year, he delivered a talk from Rashtrapati Bhavan to an international meeting on autism research in Seattle in the US. He once addressed cardiac surgeons in Abu Road (Rajasthan) while he was visiting Madurai. 

 Rashtrapati Bhavan sources said Kalam had at least 199 tours during which he delivered nearly 1,000 speeches.

 In August 2004, the official website of the President was revamped into a dynamic system where each speech he would deliver anywhere would be uploaded as soon as he had finished speaking. 

 It also allowed people to send emails to the President a facility that, sources say, elicited nearly 500 emails each day some serious, some junk and some interesting suggestions, a source said. 

 Weve put into place a system it can continue with the next President, said Vellachamy Ponraj, director of technology interface a post that was created in an attempt to use technology to allow people to talk and listen to the President. 

 Ponraj, who was earlier a scientist at a defence laboratory in Bangalore, said a tracking counter suggests that the website has drawn an average 2,50,000 hits per day, or nearly three visitors each second.

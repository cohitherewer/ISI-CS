 Buzz on bridal lehenga amp; saris

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 A sari on display in the shop

 Lucknow, Jan. 15: A Varanasi boutique owner has claimed he has orders to supply an exquisite bridal lehenga for Aishwarya and 21 Benarasi saris to be given away as wedding gifts (shagun) when she ties the knot with Abhishek Bachchan.

 We received calls this morning from Lucknow and Mumbai from people close to the Bachchan family. They ordered 21 shagun saris worth Rs 2.33 lakh for the wedding of Ash and Abhishek, said Vishnu Jalan, who owns Kabira Dresswear.

 The saris were being sent to Lucknow this evening, but the specially designed lehenga which he says will be a one-piece wonder for Ash wont be ready before the month end, Jalan said. He didnt disclose its price or the identity of those who placed the order.

 After all, the lehenga will be worn by the former Miss World on her marriage day and its priceless, Jalan smiled. Showroom sources put the price at over Rs 2 lakh.

 The 21 saris for guests are mostly in pink, scarlet, mustard, royal blue and magenta. They are studded with exquisite pearls and stones. Kabira Dresswear expects orders for 51 more.

 All orders will be supplied by the end of this month, Jalan said, fuelling speculation that the wedding could be early next month. No date was announced when the engagement was made public yesterday.

 It is no ordinary purchase, but Jalan said he wasnt surprised when he received the calls this morning. They (the callers) are the ones who had paid a visit to my showroom on November 27. They had then bought 11 saris worth Rs 50,000, at the behest of Big B, he said.

 Aishwarya had accompanied the Bachchans to temples in Varanasi on November 27. 

 Allahabad delighted

 Locals exploded crackers and women blew conch-shells as news of the engagement spread in Allahabad, home to the Bachchan family. It was the same in Varanasi.

Mumbai, April 18: The clock had struck 9, but there was still no sign of any celebration. Having waited the entire day outside the gate of the Bachchan bungalow, the media was getting restive.

 Almost an hour later, bhangra beats tore into the air as Amitabh Bachchan emerged from Prateeksha to welcome the brides family. The flashbulbs went into a frenzy and a riot almost broke out at the Guru Nanak Road crossing in Juhu as hundreds of security personnel, Black Cats and policemen struggled to hold the media and passers-by at bay.

 The marriage of the millennium had begun.

 Inside, an ecstatic and a little tense Aishwarya was doing the balle balle with her Mangalorean relatives who had arrived in two huge luxury buses.

 The AbAsh marriage is easily the biggest Bollywood has seen in several years. Never mind the buzz about the 25-30 select guests and the low-key wedding. There were at least 300 people making a song and dance about the AbAsh wedding tonight. 

 Among them were the whos who from tinsel town. Hrithik Roshan, Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan were, however, missing.

 The Calcuttans at the Prateeksha bash included filmmaker Rituparno Ghosh (in a black turban) and cricketer Rohan Gavaskar.

 Besides Ash doing the bhangra, the highlights of the night would be a tango by AbAsh choreographed by Sandeep Soparkar and Amitabh and Jaya taking the floor together.

 The half-hour ritual seemed set to stretch till the small hours of tomorrow.

 Late last night, a private party at Jalsa had the Bachchans in the company of the Ambanis, Amar Singh, Subroto Roy, Sanjay Dutt and Abhisheks close friends.

 Adman Prahlad Kakkar, whose flat in Ashs building La Mer had been used for the sangeet rehearsals, told The Telegraph: Sangeet was always meant to be the most fun part of the celebrations of the three days. After a few minutes of classical music, we are all into dirty dancing! 

 According to other sources, there was a dance duel between Karan Johar and Shiamak Davar, who choreographed Ash and Abhisheks dances at the sangeet.

 Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy were in charge of the music. Kajra re will, of course, be the highlight but we will also perform Salaam-e-ishq and Tenu leke, said Shankar Mahadevan, who had also composed the music for the sangeet ceremony of Lakshmi Mittals daughters wedding in Paris in 2004.

 While Abhishek had his friends Rohan Sippy, Sikandar Kher, Apoorva Lakhia and Goldie Behl stirring up a storm on the dance floor, Ash had neighbour Anjali Tendulkar, and aunts from her hometown in Mangalore in tow. Sachin couldnt make it. 

 Both bride and groom supposedly wore creations of Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla, the Bachchans favourite designer duo. All of Abhisheks friends were given kantha-stitched kurtas by Calcutta designer Sarbari Dutta.

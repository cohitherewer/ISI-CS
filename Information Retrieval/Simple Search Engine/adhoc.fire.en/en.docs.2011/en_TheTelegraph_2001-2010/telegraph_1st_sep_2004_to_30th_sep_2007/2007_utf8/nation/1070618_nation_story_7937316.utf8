 Cross-vote worry for BJP

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, June 17: Presidential candidate Pratibha Patil today went on a canvassing spree but might receive a lot of votes without campaigning for them if what the BJPs fears come true.

 The main Opposition party is afraid that its dissident lawmakers from Rajasthan and Gujarat might vote for Patil to spite their chief ministers, Vasundhara Raje and Narendra Modi.

 There is no way to find out who voted for whom because presidential elections are held through secret ballot, a BJP source said.

 Party president Rajnath Singh today met Rajasthan chief minister Raje, whose position has worsened with the states Gujjar MLAs turning against her after the communitys recent agitation.

 In poll-bound Gujarat, Modi has seen his campaign meetings boycotted and parallel gatherings held by the supporters of Keshubhai Patel.

 An agency report quoted an unnamed BJP leader as saying: There is a problem within the party as far as keeping all our votes intact in favour of (Bhairon Singh) Shekhawat is concerned.

 Rajnath tried to plug another source of potential embarrassment by meeting Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray. The Sena had left ally BJP red-faced by initially celebrating the choice of Patil, a Maharashtrian, by the United Progressive Alliance.

 Historic moment, Marathi President a headline in Sena mouthpiece Saamna had screamed before the reaction was toned down.

 Even without such support, Patil should be sitting pretty but she was up and about town today. The Rajasthan governor met a host of leaders, from defeated contender Karan Singh to Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and the Jan Morchas V.P. Singh to Congress leader Arjun Singh.

 The Janata Dal (United) met but didnt reveal whom it would support. The National Democratic Alliance, likely to field Shekhawat as an Independent to tempt the third front, will meet on Tuesday for a final decision.

 The third front, a motley group of BJP friends and secularists, mulled solving its dilemma by fielding its own candidate but was far from a decision yet. Its leaders meet in Chennai on Monday.

 Happy if sent to jail: Amar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 14: Amar Singh is in hospital now but he thinks jail would be a better place.

 The Samajwadi Party general secretary, who was admitted to the Batra Hospital this afternoon, dared Mayavati to send him and his party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav to prison.

 I will feel very happy if I am sent to jail. Jail is a very nice place. Mayavati will do a good service to me by sending me to jail, he said in an interview to a news channel.

 Hospital sources said Amar, convalescing after a kidney stone surgery, was undergoing a medical check-up. He was kept under observation.

 Breaking his silence after his partys debacle in the Assembly polls, Amar said the real defeat was not of the Samajwadi Party but of the Sonia Gandhi-Rahul Gandhi combine and the BJP.

 He also accused Mayavati, the new Uttar Pradesh chief minister, of practising vendetta politics.

 Amar declared he was not afraid of Sonia, the CBI, the Intelligence Bureau or the RAW, adding that a collective onslaught by Sonia and Mayavati was most welcome.

 He scoffed at suggestions that Amitabh Bachchans campaign had backfired. Mr Bachchan never campaigned for the Samajwadi Party. He campaigned as the brand ambassador for Uttar Pradesh, he said.

 Amar also took a dig at the Congresss performance in the polls and the way the media played up Rahuls campaign. 

 The dimple on his cheeks became national news. His pompous statement that we (the Gandhi family) have broken Pakistan are all tall claims.

 The truth is that the partys (vote) percentage has gone down and so have the seats. Congress is routed. Now every channel is saying it was Rahul babas fault. So I am not going to be on the defensive, he said.

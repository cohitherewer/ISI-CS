 DNA test for Basmati purity 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The DNA fingerprinting technique will be used to determine Basmati adulteration

 New

 Delhi, July 11: Biologist Javaregowda Nagaraju who routinely lends his expertise to assign names to unidentified bodies, indict rapists and establish paternity now has a gift for Indias rice exporters.

 The researcher at the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) in Hyderabad has used the technology to tackle forensic cases to design a test that can detect adulteration in Basmati rice.

 Indian instrumentation company Labindia, which has acquired the technology from CDFD, hopes to release within the next six weeks kits that will help in testing and certifying the purity of Basmati samples.

 The kits are based on repeating DNA sequences that occur in unique patterns in Basmati varieties. Nagaraju and his colleagues had first identified these Basm-ati signatures and demonstrated the potential of DNA tests nearly five years ago.

 We have a foolproof way to distinguish Basmati from non-Basmati rice, said J. Gourishankar, CDFD director. The technology advance has now enabled the development of a test that can be done easily in a single reaction, he said.

 Basmati rice exports have been growing, but there are concerns about adulteration. A survey of 363 samples of rice labelled Basmati conducted by the UK Food Standards Agency five years ago had revealed non-Basmati rice in 167 (46 per cent) samples. Thirty samples had non-Basmati rice content that exceeded 60 per cent.

 While Basmati rice varieties have unique aroma and shape, it is not easy to distinguish them from non-Basmati varieties through traditional visual inspection. There are other methods such as protein profiling, but they are time-consuming and not as reliable as this new technology, said Anupama Gaur, team leader for applications in Labindia.

 Agricultural experts believe the $1billion Basmati export trade is growing and moving towards uniform regulations that will set an upper limit of 7 per cent non-Basmati rice in consignments labelled Basmati.

 The CDFD has used the test to certify more than 500 samples of Basmati rice headed for foreign markets. Gaur said the new kits to be released by September have been tailored to identify all 13 varieties of Basmati exported from India.

 The new test can detect any level of adulteration above 1 per cent, Nagaraju said. While the DNA fingerprinting method is similar to what is used in forensic cases, he said, there is one key difference. 

 Its more difficult in forensic identification, we do qualitative analysis, but in the case of Basmati rice, we need to quantify the levels of adulteration.

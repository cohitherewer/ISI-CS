 Lucknow, March 30: At least 20 people, including five security personnel and 15 inmates, were injured when a clash broke out between inmates and a raiding team at Meerut jail this morning.

 The incident occurred around 8 am, when a special team reached the jail to investigate complaints that some criminals were running an extortion racket on mobile phones. There was a suspicion that this was being done in collusion with jail officials and local police.

 The inmates were instigated by a section of the criminals to attack the officers. One officer said missiles and abuses were hurled at them. Jail authorities and the police were forced to baton-charge inmates to bring the situation under control.

 Several cellphones, narcotics, weapons, CDs and a huge amount of cash were found during the raid, revealing the nexus between police, inmates and prison officials.

 A senior jail official was suspended and a probe ordered against two others. The raiding team accused a section of the jail staff of being in league with hardened criminals. The swoop followed the seizure of a cellphone from an inmate by the Meerut superintendent of police on March 28.

 Agra DIG Kamal Saxena, who was leading the raid, blamed the local police for instigating inmates. We came here on the orders of the government. But Meerut police assured inmates they would stand by them during the raid. That is when the trouble started, he said, holding the jail superintendent and his deputy responsible.

 Senior superintendent of police (Agra) Amrish Gaur said prisoners attacked his team when illegal items were being seized. 

 Jail officials denied the charge, saying it was merely a lack of coordination between Agra police and their counterparts in Meerut that resulted in the fracas. We have identified some of the inmates who attacked the team, said senior superintendent of police (Meerut) Deepesh Juneja. 

 Inspector-general (Meerut range) K.N.D. Diwedi said there had been complaints about the use of mobiles in the jail. Inmates were preventing us from carrying out the raid. The search had to be halted for sometime but we resumed it later. 

 Special forces from the provincial armed constabulary, an elite unit of the state police, have been posted outside the jail, which has more than 2,000 inmates. The situation has been brought under control now and there is nothing to worry, Diwedi said.

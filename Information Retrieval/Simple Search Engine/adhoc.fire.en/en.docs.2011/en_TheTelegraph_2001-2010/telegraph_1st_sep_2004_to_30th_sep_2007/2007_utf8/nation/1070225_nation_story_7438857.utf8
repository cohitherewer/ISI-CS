 Mayavati pullout punch

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Feb. 24: Mayavati today pulled out her 67 Bahujan Samaj Party MLAs from the Assembly to try and embarrass the Uttar Pradesh government two days before it convenes a controversial Assembly session to seek a trust vote.

 The former chief minister sent 78 resignations in all to Speaker Mata Prasad Pandey, including those of two Independents, five BJP members and four Samajwadi Party MLAs, claiming all of them had joined the BSP today.

 The resignations will make it easier for Mulayam Singh Yadav to win Mondays floor test, but it could be a hollow victory. For, Mayavatis seizure of the moral ground against the ridiculously unauthorised session may now put other Opposition parties under pressure to follow suit.

 The BSP chiefs surprise comes days after governor T.V. Rajeswar is believed to have told the Centre that Mondays session would be illegal because the Assemblys five-year term expires on Sunday.

 The resignations are in disgust against the unconstitutional government in Uttar Pradesh, Mayavati said. But her move is also being seen as an attempt to pre-empt cross-voting by her MLAs during the floor test.

 The Speaker said he would decide on the resignations on Monday. The resignations reduce the Houses strength already down to 388 after 13 defectors were disqualified recently to 310. This leaves Mulayam needing just 156 votes. The ruling Samajwadis claim they have 210.

 Even if the 24 other defectors, on whom the Speaker has to take a call on Monday, are disqualified, Mulayam would be left with 190 votes (four of the defectors have returned to the BSP and are among those who resigned today).

 Our task has become easy now. Mayavatis gimmick is not going to work in her favour, said minister Ashoke Vajpayee.

 Mayavati told reporters she was no longer interested in the numbers game as the House had already completed its tenure.

 Her dramatic announcement forced other Opposition parties to consider their options.

 Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal has already said it wouldnt attend the House. But the BJP stopped short of asking its MLAs to resign as many of them have friendly relations with the Samajwadi Party and a hard decision thrust on them may cause a split.

 The BJP has 83 MLAs, of whom 11 are said to have voted for Mulayam during last months trust vote while five sided with Mayavati today.

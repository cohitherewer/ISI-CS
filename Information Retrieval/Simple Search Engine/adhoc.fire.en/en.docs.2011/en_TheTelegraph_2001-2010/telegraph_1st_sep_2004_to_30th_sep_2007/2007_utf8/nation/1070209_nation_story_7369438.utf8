 Bookie who puts his bets on Pak

 OUR BUREAU 

 Mumbai/Delhi, Feb. 8: An old betting hand with a soft spot for the Pakistan cricket team.

 As police investigate the latest betting scandal to hit the world of cricket, a sketchy image emerged of the man in the middle of the storm.

 Cricket bookie Mukesh Kochchar preferred the men in green from across the border for his betting deals and shuttled extensively between the UAE, Mumbai and Delhi, Mumbai police sources said today.

 He worked closely with Dawood Ibrahim, who is believed to be living in Karachi, and his syndicate, which dabbles heavily in cricket betting, especially on teams from the sub-continent.

 Besides a company named Kochchar Finance in Nagpur, he owns a two-storeyed house in Gurgaon, the sources said. But Nagpur police commissioner S.P.S. Yadav said his department did not have definite information that Kochchar Finance belonged to the bookie. 

 We have information that Kochchar dabbled in property dealings, and commodity exports. We suspect that he indulged in property dealings for the underworld, Yadav said.

 A Mumbai police official associated with organised crime investigations said the bookie has been in the business for over a decade. Kochchar is an old hand in the betting business and has been around for the last 15 years at least. He operates out of the UAE, but has a strong base in Mumbais betting circles. Pakistan is his pet team for betting.

 According to Nagpur police, who tapped his phone conversations with Marlon Samuels, the West Indies cricketer who allegedly gave him information on the team, Kochchar used two SIM cards and routed his four phone calls to Samuels through PCOs to dodge the police.

 After breaking quite a bit of sweat, the police finally traced the calls to Faridabad.

 That Kochchar and Samuels shared a close friendship has been acknowledged by the cricketer. But he said he was not aware of Kochchars bookie background.

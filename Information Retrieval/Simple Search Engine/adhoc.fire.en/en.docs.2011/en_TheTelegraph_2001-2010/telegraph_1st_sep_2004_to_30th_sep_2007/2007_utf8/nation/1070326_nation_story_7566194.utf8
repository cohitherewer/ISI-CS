 Car Nicobar, March 25: Defence minister A.K. Antony today said a decision on withdrawal of troops from Jammu and Kashmir would be determined by the assessments of the armed forces and security agencies.

 PDP leader Mufti Mohammed Sayeed has demanded demilitarisation in the state and last week met the Prime Minister. Antonys remarks are an elucidation of the views of the Prime Ministers Office but do indicate a shift of emphasis from the actual to the aspirational.

 I can speak as a civilian and say that I have a dream. I dream of when all our soldiers (in Jammu and Kashmir) can go back to their cantonments. I am waiting for that day. If the situation is fast improving we will review and take the appropriate decision, he explained.

 The defence minister said though the decision would be taken by the political leadership, it would be shaped by the inputs received from the armed forces.

 The generals will watch and tell us, he said. So far as we are concerned, the armed forces were sent there to protect our territory. The threat is still there. The infiltration situation has somewhat stabilised. At the same time infiltrators are now trying out new routes, such as through the coasts.

 Nearly all indicators that the army studies point to a drop in the level of infiltration and insurgent violence in Jammu and Kashmir over the last four years. The ceasefire with Pakistan along the Line of Control and the Actual Ground Position Line has also held true since October 2003. But senior army sources say insurgency is down because of the presence of the military and not because Pakistan has turned off its tap of support for the militants.

 But Antony asserts that the governments position on demands or requests to demilitarise or cut down troop presence is now more nuanced. In contrast to earlier response of outright rejection of such proposals the Centre would now like to take the stand that demilitarisation is an objective it aspires to. However, it was not in a position to take such a measure because the situation on the ground was not ripe yet.

 We are in a democracy. We are not happy to deploy the armed forces, but what can we do? The objective situation has forced our hand, he said.

 Despite a decline in the number of infiltrators, support continues from across the border. He did not name Pakistan but said its military rulers statements and pious wishes are not enough; actions are needed.

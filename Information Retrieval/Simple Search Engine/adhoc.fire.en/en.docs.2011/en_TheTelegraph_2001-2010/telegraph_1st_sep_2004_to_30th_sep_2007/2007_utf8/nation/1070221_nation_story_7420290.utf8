 Cauvery unity at Tamil Nadu meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Karunanidhi

 Chennai, Feb. 20: Taking a leaf from Karnatakas unified approach to the Cauvery issue and sensing that solidarity was the best guarantee for the safety of several lakh Tamils in Bangalore, the political class in Tamil Nadu has closed ranks on the issue.

 At an all-party meeting chaired by chief minister M. Karunanidhi yesterday, all the major political parties in Tamil Nadu shed their differences and unanimously resolved to file a review petition against the Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunals final award.

 The four-hour meeting at the secretariat discussed the merits and demerits of the final award to Tamil Nadu and pitched in a refreshingly low-key fashion for a review after obtaining advice from technical and legal experts to overcome the disadvantages of the tribunals order.

 In marked contrast to earlier instances when political differences would surface among members of delegations to Delhi on the Cauvery issue, yesterdays resolution was unanimously adopted, Tamil Nadu Congress president M. Krishnaswamy told reporters after the meeting.

 Representatives of the main Opposition party, the ADMK, emphasised their leader Jayalalithaas stance to get the Centre to notify the tribunals final award quickly and move the Supreme Court simultaneously to redress Tamil Nadus grievances regarding the award.

 However, the ADMK agreed to the proposal to file a review petition after Karunanidhi in his sum-up indicated that the state was not averse to moving the apex court if necessary, sources said.

 Karunanidhi today said the unity among the parties would send strong signals to the fringe violent and chauvinist groups in Karnataka.

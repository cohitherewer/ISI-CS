 Sonia, Rahul ready for battle

 Rahul and Sonia: All set? 

 New Delhi, March 7: Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Amethi MP Rahul Gandhi started their preparations for the Uttar Pradesh elections in earnest with back-to-back meetings today at 10 Janpath.

 Party sources said the discussions focused on three issues: candidate selection, mobilisation strategies and alliances.

 Ashok Gehlot, the general secretary minding Uttar Pradesh, and Salman Khurshid, the state party chief, were present at the meetings. The eight zonal supervisors have been called separately and asked to give their feedback on the state of the Congress in their areas, profile some of the suitable candidates and explain why they are suitable, detail caste equations and the position of the other parties.

 Among those Sonia and Rahul met today were Rasheed Alvi, Sanjay Singh and R.P.N. Singh. The rest will be called tomorrow.

 The zonal minders stressed that the candidates should be shortlisted at the earliest so that irritants like rebellions could be nipped in the bud and they could get their act together. Sonia and Rahul are expected to be done with this exercise by the end of the week or early next week.

 The meetings also took stock of alliances in Uttar Pradesh. The leaders noted how quick the BJP was to grab the Apna Dal, a caste-based party of Kurmis which has a base in the eastern districts even as the Congress was still drawing up the pluses and minu- ses of potential partners. 

 At any time, the Apna Dal nets a vote share of 4 or 5 per cent, a party functionary conceded.

 The Congress is looking at clinching a deal with the Jan Morcha, led by V.P. Singh. The umbrella outfit includes Samajwadi rebel MP Raj Babbar, the CPI, the NCP and sundry parties representing the most backward castes.

 It is also eyeing Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal, which is strong in western Uttar Pradesh where the Congress needs a foothold. 

 On rallying workers, the only plan Rahul unveiled was to draft 100 young workers from across the country. They have been tasked to work on 100 constituencies where the Congress came a cropper in the last elections and ensure it polls at least 10,000 votes this time.

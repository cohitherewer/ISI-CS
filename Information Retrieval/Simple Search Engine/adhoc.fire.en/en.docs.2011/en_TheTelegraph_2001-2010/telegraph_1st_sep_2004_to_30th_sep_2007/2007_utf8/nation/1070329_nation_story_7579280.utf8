 Geelani denied US visa

New Delhi, March 28 (PTI): Hardline Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani has been denied a visa by the US on the ground that he had refused to renounce violence as a weapon to achieve the independence of Kashmir.

 Geelanis family said they were called to the US consulate in Mumbai and told of the US state departments decision. 

 Geelani (in picture) was operated on at Mumbais Tata Memorial hospital on Monday and doctors had successfully removed a malignant tumour from his surviving kidney. One of his kidneys had been removed in 2003.

 The 77-year-old chairman of the breakaway Hurriyat Conference wanted to undergo treatment in the US.

 When contacted, a US embassy spokesperson confirmed that Geelanis request for a visa had been turned down.

 Asked on what grounds his request was denied, the spokesperson said under US laws, information about visa applications was confidential but Geelani has consistently failed to renounce violence as a means of achieving his political goal in Kashmir.

 The US supports India and Pakistans ongoing discussions on how to resolve important bilateral issues, including the question of Kashmir, the spokesperson added.

 Normal relations and increase in trade and people-to- people ties would benefit both countries and the region, the spokesperson said.

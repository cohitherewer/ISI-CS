 Diamond vote bank cuts Modi at home

 BASANT RAWAT

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 5: Narendra Modi is a hard politician, but diamonds can cut even the hardest.

 In the run-up to the state polls, the chief minister faces an enemy that not only makes up a crucial vote bank but is flush with money because its in the diamond business.

 The Patel community, which controls half of the states Rs 45,000-crore diamond industry, is bankrolling the BJP rebels farmer rallies across the state, held under the banner of an anti-Modi outfit, Sardar Patel Utkarsh Samiti.

 We can go to any extent to overthrow Modi. Money is no constraint, leading diamond exporter Chunnibhai Gajera told The Telegraph.

 The Patels have been the BJPs backbone in Gujarat since the party came to power in 1995. Such was their sway that the party had to pick a Patel as chief minister against the sentiments of the workers and at the cost of popular leader Shankersinh Vaghela.

 Modi had become chief minister replacing Keshubhai Patel in 2001, starting his relations with the influential community on the wrong foot.

 Over the years, the chief ministers dictatorial style caused resentment among the Patels. The discontent erupted into an uprising last month with a massive anti-Modi convention held in the Varachha area of Surat, Gujarats financial capital.

 Varachha has about 8 lakh Patels, most of them involved in Surats diamond industry where nine out of 11 diamonds in the world are cut and polished.

 The enmity deepened last week with the BJP suspending five rebel MLAs all Leuva Patels, who control a large chunk of the vote. Of them, Dhiru Gajera and Gordhan Zadaphia are directly involved in the diamond business.

 Gajeras two brothers Chhunibhai and Vasant are leading diamond exporters and helped found the Utkarsh Samiti.

 These developments are very disturbing for the party, a senior BJP leader in Surat admitted. He said he had no sympathy for the dissidents, but conceded that Modis style of functioning is certainly problematic.

 Among the leaders of the anti-Modi campaign is Jivraj Darukawala of Devi Diamonds, a former state BJP vice-president who is close to Keshubhai. Darukawala owns a private plane, recently invested Rs 1,000 crore in Goa, and runs a business in Hong Kong.

 Its in the backdrop of this that 30-odd Patel diamond merchants decided to boycott Modis dream SEZ project a jewellery park near Surat by withdrawing their deposits and refusing to set up showrooms.

 Tinted glass stumps Dhoni

 Shade trouble

 Ranchi, Jan. 9: After tough times in fending Shaun Pollock amp; Co. on bouncy wickets in South Africa, Team India wicket-keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni faced an awkward situation on his home turf today.

 Driving a Mitshubishi Pajero SUV with tinted glasses on Ranchi roads cost him Rs 90 today. This is the second vehicle of Dhoni to be fined for having tinted glasses. Last month, his Scorpio was fined. 

 Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Naresh Prasad Singh said the traffic police clamped the fine on Dhoni since there was black film on the vehicle he was driving. Dhoni was fined just Rs 90 since this was the first offence with this vehicle, the SSP explained. 

 The cricketer did not object to pay the fine, Singh said. The SSP said the cricketer has been asked to remove the black film from the glasses. The amount of fine will increase if the vehicle is caught with tinted glasses again, he said. 

 We hope he will remove the films, the SSP said, adding driving vehicles with tinted glasses is banned in Ranchi. The district police has launched a drive to check the practice.

 Dhoni could not be contacted, but his elder brother, Narendra Singh Dhoni, said they had paid fine once for the Scorpio and would remove the screen from the Pajero as well. 

 Dhoni left in the morning and would return tomorrow, he said.

 Narendra said: I had tried to convince the police when they charged for tinted glasses in Scorpio that screens on the glasses were necessary for Dhoni since he gets mobbed when identified moving in the city, but in vain, he said.

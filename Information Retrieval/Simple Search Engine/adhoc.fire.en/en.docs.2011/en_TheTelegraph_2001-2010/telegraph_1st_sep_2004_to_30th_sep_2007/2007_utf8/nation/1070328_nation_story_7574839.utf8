 India exit sparks tussle over ad rates 

 New Delhi, March 27 (PTI): Indias early exit from the World Cup has prompted calls to Sony for reworking ad contracts.

 We believe the channel would accommodate some requests, based on its long-term business relationship with advertisers and agencies, said Dara Acidwalla, secretary-general of the Advertising Agencies Association of India. 

 His statement comes a day after the association and the Indian Broadcasting Foundation issued a joint statement asking advertisers, media planners and the channel not to renegotiate Cup deals. 

 Contracts are always bilateral in nature. The parties who have entered into an agreement can modify them based on various reasons....The key is that the parties should agree to the modification. It cannot be unilateral, Acidwalla said. 

 Naresh Chahal, the broadcasting foundations director (finance), said there was no question of renegotiating deals. It is a commercial contract and it has to be honoured, he said. When India reached the finals in 2003, Sony was the broadcaster. At that time did Sony ask advertisers to pay higher than what was agreed in sealed deals?

 The advertisers association has been under pressure from its members to push for renegotiation of contracts. Acidwalla, however, said seasoned advertisers would have factored in the risks while agreeing to the rates. 

 LG exit sign

 LG Electronics is unlikely to renew its sponsorship contract with the International Cricket Council. Industry sources say the South Korean company believes it has achieved substantial visibility in India during the seven years it has been sponsoring the game. The cricket body has not said when it will call fresh bids.

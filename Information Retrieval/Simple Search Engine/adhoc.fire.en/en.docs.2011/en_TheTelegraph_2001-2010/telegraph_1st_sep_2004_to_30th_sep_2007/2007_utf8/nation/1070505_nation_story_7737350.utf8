 On trial in Modi yard: cops smelling of roses

 - Police to shed khaki for perfumed uniforms in pink amp; lavender

 SUJAN DUTTA 

 Ahmedabad, May 4: Narendra Modis police in Gujarat will present a new look next week, draped in smartly outfitted and fragrant uniforms that smell of roses. 

 They are raising a stink at the moment of the putrefied remains of Sohrabuddin Sheikh allegedly killed in a fake encounter and his wife Kauser Bi, also believed to have been killed by the police. 

 But the Gujarat force seems to have taken Woody Allens advice. The director once said nothing is too bad if you are dressed for it. 

 The fragrant new uniforms are expected to draw people to the cops like bees to a flower. The men in uniform would also feel more pleasant in them as the new fabric will moisture manage (read sweat-control) the long armpits of the law and keep the body temperature down by 5 Celsius. 

 The concepts for the designs have been drawn up. The first trials are likely on Wednesday or Thursday. 

 Traffic police in Ahmedabads busy junctions at Paldi, C.G. Road, Satellite, Vastrapur and Maninagar will shed their thick, hot khakis. Instead, they will sport uniforms in blue, lavender, forest greens, beige, brown, pink and dark chocolate. 

 The uniforms will smell of roses, jasmine and lemon. The fragrance, embedded in the fabric, should last at least 40 washings. 

 But the timing is strange. When the police force is looking like a gang of thugs after the fake encounter heat the very definition of the most organised mafia that former chief justice P.N. Bhagwati once called the police force in India they are in the middle of an image makeover in Ahmedabad. 

 The dilemma is Somesh Singhs. 

 Somesh is the young and handsome Bihari who heads the department of apparel design and merchandising at the National Institute of Design here. 

 What a time it is for me! he says. 

 The irony hits him hard even as he feels the length of the beige linen that is a sample for the new uniforms. A Bangalore-based company, Resil Silicones and Finishes, has supplied the sweet-smelling fabric. The aroma is burberry. 

 I was telling my father-in-law just this morning, here I am designing new uniforms and working out how to make the police look good and smart and friendly and here is the police in Gujarat that is looking like a villain to the world, he says. 

 In February, the Gujarat government contracted Somesh and his team for the image makeover. The deputy inspector-general (traffic), Manoj Agarwal, was impressed with the presentations and moved high offices. Somesh has set himself a deadline of four months. 

 We are giving the police with their stressful jobs some aromatherapy, Somesh explains. The uniforms will be fragrant. (When Somesh shows the sample of burberry fabric in his study, a sweet smell wafts across the room.) 

 He and his team will elicit the opinion of the force and from pedestrians and motorists, asking them to jot down remarks on notebooks. 

 On their way to the crossings, where the new uniforms will be displayed, Somesh and some of his team members may drive through Vishala Circle, where Sohrabuddin was said to have been killed in an encounter by D.G. Vanzara and his men. 

 In reality, Sohrabuddin was plucked out of a bus from Hyderabad that night in November 2005, tortured in a police safe house, brought to the crossing in Ahmedabad where Gujarat and Rajasthan police pumped bullets into his battered body. 

 When the new-look police move to Paldi, they will do so with the knowledge that just last evening families of victims held in jail under foisted anti-terror cases by Vanzaras anti-terrorist squad met here to discuss if they could also move court. 

 A sobbing 68-year-old Alina Bibi Alla Rakha of house No. 2202 in Kalupur Panch Kuan was narrating how her son, a maulana, was picked up in May 2003, hung upside down, wrapped in a blanket and beaten from toe to head and back to the toe again during interrogation. The 32-year-old Ahmed Hussain was sent to jail after 41 days in police custody. 

 In Mumbai, the family of Ishrat Jahan Raza, the 19-year-old college girl, is trying to move court, too, against Gujarat police. Ishrat did not need new designs to look beautiful in her bloodied and bullet-ridden salwar-kameez lying prostrate and lifeless in an Ahmedabad street. 

 The 19-year-old student of Khalsa College of Arts and Commerce in Matunga, central Mumbai, was gunned down by Gujarats anti-terrorist squad led by Vanzara in 2004.

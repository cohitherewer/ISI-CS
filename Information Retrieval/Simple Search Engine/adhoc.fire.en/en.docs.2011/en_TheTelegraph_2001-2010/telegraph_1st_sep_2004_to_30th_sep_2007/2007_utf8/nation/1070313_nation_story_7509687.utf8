 Indians hack and steal

 Washington, March 12 (AP): Three men from India have been indicted on federal charges of hacking into online brokerage accounts operated by TD Ameritrade Holding Corp, E-Trade Financial Corp and others to inflate stock values and their own profits.

 The alleged hack-pump-and-dump scheme has cost one brokerage firm at least $2 million in losses, prosecutors said.

 Two of the three suspects Jaisankar Marimuthu, 32, of Chennai and Thirugnanam Ramanathan, 34, an Indian native who lives in Malaysia were arrested in recent weeks in Hong Kong, the US Justice Department said. The third, Chockalingam Ramanathan, 33, also of Chennai, is still at large.

 The case marks the first time hackers suspected of defrauding US-based online brokerage firms have been arrested overseas.

 An estimated 60 customers and nine US brokerage firms, including Ameritrade, E-Trade and OptionsXpress, were duped in the case during a four-month period last year, according to the Justice Department.

 The three suspects bought stocks through the US online firms with their own accounts, according to the 23-count indictment returned in January and unsealed on today in Omaha, Nebraska.

 Operating from Thailand and India, the men then allegedly used stolen identity information to pose as other online share-buyers, inflating the value of myriad securities, including those of search engine giant Google Inc.

 The men later sold their own shares at a higher price turning a profit of more than $121,500, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which filed separate civil charges against all three men in federal court in Nebraska.

 One victim had $180,000 cash and equity in his account, and five days later returned from a trip to find a negative $200,000 balance, according to the SEC.

 A spokesman for OptionsXpress declined to say how much it lost in the scheme or how long the Chicago-based firm had been working with government investigators.

 But John Reed Stark, chief of the SECs Office of Internet Enforcement, praised the online brokerage communitys cooperation, which included responding to requests for information in real-time since the scamsters can manipulate online accounts from nearly anywhere on the planet.

 Dad appeal to hang rapist son

 MUZAFFAR RAINA

 Srinagar, July 30: Ghulam Mohammad Mir is a father who wants his son hanged in public.

 Azhar, 28, is one of the four accused in the alleged rape and murder of a Class VIII student in the village of Langate in Handwara, 80km from Srinagar, that has rocked the Valley.

 It is our humble request before the government and the courts that our son be hanged in public, in our very presence and that too in Langate village, the 60-year-old father said in a statement to the media.

 My son is involved in the gruesome rape and murder of a little girl. We want death for our son so that nobody dares commit such a crime in the future.

 Police sources said the families and relatives of two of the accused the other two are from outside the state are facing social boycott from their neighbours. Mir, a farmer, has another son and two daughters. 

 There was so much anger against the families that we thought they would be lynched. There is round-the-clock security in the village, an officer said.

 Reports of the crime had led to massive protests in the Valley and prompted some militant groups to serve a seven-day deadline to migrant labourers to leave Kashmir. One of the accused, Jahangir, is a carpenter from Bengal and another, Suresh, a cobbler from Rajasthan.

 The militant groups later withdrew their ultimatum after Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani said they should not interfere in such issues. The militant leadership later said no outsider would be harmed and clarified that it only wanted the criminal elements to leave.

 Handwara police chief Haseeb Mugal said Mirs statement would not make much difference to the case.

 The courts look for evidence and not emotions. But yes, we are recording the statement of his father and if he says his son has a criminal record, it will help us, Mugal said.

 Mirs statement says his son is a history-sheeter and that the family had in the past handed him over to the police several times.

 He is a vagabond and a drug addict. Apart from handing him over to the police, we have punished him on several occasions, the father said.

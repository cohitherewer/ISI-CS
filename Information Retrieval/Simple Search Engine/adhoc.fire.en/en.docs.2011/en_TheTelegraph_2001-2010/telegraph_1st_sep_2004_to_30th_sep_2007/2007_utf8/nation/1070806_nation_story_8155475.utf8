 Nikam contempt alert for Bollywood

 Mumbai, Aug. 5 (PTI): Ujjwal Nikam, the prosecutor in the 1993 Bombay blasts case, has warned that a planned Bollywood campaign in support of Sanjay Dutt would amount to contempt of court.

 This type of campaign is unfair. It shakes the confidence of the common man in the judiciary and is an indirect attempt at influencing the court of law, he said. 

 If someone starts such a campaign criticising the order of the court, it certainly amounts to contempt of court, Nikam said. There are still remedies left open to the convicted prisoner. 

 Nikam was reacting to news reports that Bollywood stars were thinking of launching a signature campaign to free Sanjay, who has been given a six-year jail term for illegally possessing weapons.

 The Bombay blasts prosecutor criticised TV channels, too. The way they are running polls and interviews, romanticising the prisoner, is ridiculous. Why isnt Bollywood shedding tears for the victims of the bomb blasts? he asked.

 Sanjay is expected to appeal against his sentence in the Supreme Court.

 A scion too many for House of Scindias 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Jyotiraditya Scindia: Three's a crowd?

 Bhopal, April 15: Akshay Bhansali Scindia left Shivpuri last evening on a happy note after a week-long political familiarisation programme, promising to be back soon.

 But the 27-year-old MTV veejays foray into the Scindia citadel has left many uncomfortable. Some of them are from Congress MP Jyotiraditya Scindias camp. 

 Officially, the Scindias refrain from speaking against each other, but the buzz in Shivpuri is that BJP leader Yashodhara Raje Scindia is preparing son Akshay to contest the 2008 Assembly polls. Shivpuri is part of Jyotiradityas Guna parliamentary seat.

 Tension between the familys two strands is visible on the ground, too. Mother and son didnt stay at Bombay Kothi, the famous Scindia residence, but put up at a modest state-run circuit house and family loyalist Diwan Surendra Lals residence, spread over some 20 acres on the Agra-Mumbai highway that cuts through Shivpuri.

 According to family retainer Sardar Angre, its unusual for Yashodhara not to check into the Kothi. The Kothi was a prized possession of Amma Saheb Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia. The property is run by a trust. Under the law, her daughter Yashodhara has as much right to it as the rest of the family members, he said from Mumbai.

 Until 1998, Yashodhara was a regular at the Kothi, running her Assembly election campaign as a BJP candidate, Shivpuri residents said. However, relations frayed after Madhavrao Scindias death and, by the 2003 polls, her campaign base had shifted to the home of Surendra Lal.

 Angre, a BJP leader of respectable standing, isnt too optimistic about Akshays prospects as a politician. The Scindias must realise democracy isnt about fielding family members. You cant bring anyone from outside India and give a ticket. I think the young man will face a lot of difficulties if he is fielded now, he added.

 He spoke of Jyotiraditya as an example. The MPs biggest problem, he said, was that he had to enter politics without really getting a chance to cut his teeth at it. Madhavrao had gained a lot under the watchful eyes of the Rajmata. But Jyotiraditya didnt get such an orientation.

 During his trip, Akshay spoke haltingly, from a prepared text. On an average, he visited five to six villages a day, spending about half an hour in each. His speeches revolved around the greatness of the Scindias, the need to infuse fresh blood in public life and his belief in the BJP ideology.

 Angre said it was an open secret that Jyotiraditya isnt close to Akshay and Yashodhara. In the family, only Vasundhara Raje (Rajasthan chief minister) is a true inheritor of the Rajmatas legacy, he said. In a recent interview, however, Akshay had denied rifts in the Scindia family but admitted he didnt hang out with Jyotiraditya and Dushyant, Vasundharas son and a BJP MP.

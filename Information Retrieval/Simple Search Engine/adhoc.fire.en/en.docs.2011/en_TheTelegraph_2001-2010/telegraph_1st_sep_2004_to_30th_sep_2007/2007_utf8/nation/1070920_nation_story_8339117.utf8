 War push to Siachen treks 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The Centre today said over 15 trekking expeditions, including foreign teams, have been escorted by the Indian Army to the Siachen Glacier and its neighbourhood since September 2000. 

 The implication was Pakistans objection to an Indian venture that began today was irrelevant. 

 The number of expeditions involving foreigners to Siachen has increased since the US-led war in Afghanistan. 

 What the government does not speak about is the reasons for the rise in frequency in the number of treks. On the face of it, the army is engaged in military exchanges with counterparts from other countries, largely from the West, but also from Central Asia.

 But the gradual glasnost in Siachen that was closed to foreign visits till about 2000 is a fallout of the Afghanistan war since 2001. Foreign particularly US and Nato countries want an increasing exposure in Siachen chiefly to train their troops for the coalition and Nato-sponsored International Security Assistance Force contingents in Afghanistan. 

 Ladakh, the eastern Karakoram and large parts of Afghanistan near its border with Pakistan have similar terrain. 

 In recent years, there have been many foreign trekkers also (to Siachen), defence minister A.K. Antony said.

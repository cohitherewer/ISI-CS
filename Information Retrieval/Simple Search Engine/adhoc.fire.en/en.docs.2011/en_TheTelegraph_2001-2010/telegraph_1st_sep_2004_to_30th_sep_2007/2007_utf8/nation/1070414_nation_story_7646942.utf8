 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Own web snares Spiderman thief

 Like Spiderman, he spun a web, but eventually got entangled himself. Dinesh Jangid climbed into a third-floor apartment through a bathroom duct kept open for renovation.

 But the 28-year-old wasnt resting at such a mean achievement. Testing his acrobatic skills, he pulled off the feat again this time on the 13th floor. But by then, police arrived.

 Unfortunately for Dinesh, he left behind some identity cards on the ground. We found stolen PAN cards and some Tata Indicom SIM cards in a bag that was kept at the base of the apartment, a police officer said. Few thieves leave behind a photo-identification like this one.

 We scanned his SIM card and tracked him down to a mason who he used to work for, said inspector Sanjay Thakur of Powai police station. After his arrest, Dinesh disclosed he had worked as a carpenter in the same building four years back. The knowledge helped him scale the heights but, alas, not the bars of a jail hes in now. 

 Small is not so beautiful

 The Spiderman thief isnt the only one spinning a web. Small units in Andhra Pradesh, the ones that churn out a variety of items from pickles to papads, are now staring at the prospect of falling into the taxmans net.

 Most of these firms in the unorganised sector have been doing brisk business but havent had to pay tax so far. 

 On its part, the Centre identified 77 businesses on which a service tax of 12.2 per cent is to be imposed. The money raised from this source is to be transferred to states. 

 Excited at the prospect of a revenue boost, Andhra Pradesh added 30 other services to the list, suggesting these could be taxed from 2008-09. 

 If the state has its way, even religious discourses, garbage collection services and house rents wont escape the tax net.

 Metro cash on track

 Finances for the metro rail planned in Bangalore appear to be on track. Last week, the Japan Bank for International Co-operation said it would chip in with loans that would help pay for 30 per cent of the project cost.

 The bank, which funded 60 per cent of the Delhi metros first phase, says negotiations have been opened to decide just how much will be required for the Bangalore plan. Like Delhi, the project could change the way Bangalore, hardly the best in public transport, commutes. 

 What we are clear about is that we will provide 30 per cent of the cost of Bangalores metro, said Kikvo Nakagawa, who is chief representative of the bank in India. He dropped enough hints that his organisation could look at funding similar projects in other cities, too. 

 Wave wonder

 Fishermen of Keechankpuppam, a coastal village in Nagapattinam that bore the brunt of the December 2004 tsunami, stumbled on a surprise that had washed ashore: a statue of Goddess Saraswati, with the veena in hand. 

 On the 75-kg idol were inscribed the words Chennai Royapuram-2004. This led many to the conclusion that the statue might have been swept away by the killer tides, but survived over two years of the corrosive waves to glide nearly 325 km south of Chennai in the ocean.

 he fishermen, many of whom still have memories of the tsunami flooding back to their minds, feel the Goddess of Learning has arrived like a blessing. They have decided to install the statue right there in the village.

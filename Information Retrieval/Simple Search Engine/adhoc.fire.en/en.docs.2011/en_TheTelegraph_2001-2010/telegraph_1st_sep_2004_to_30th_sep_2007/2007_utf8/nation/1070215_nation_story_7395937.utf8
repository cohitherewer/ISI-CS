 New Delhi, Feb. 14: National security adviser M.K. Narayanan has said terrorist groups are using stock exchanges to raise funds. 

 Isolated instances of terrorist outfits manipulating the stock markets to raise funds for their operations have been reported. Stock exchanges in Mumbai and Chennai have, on occasion, reported that fictitious or notional companies were engaging in stock market operations, he said in Munich last week. Some of these were traced to terror groups, he said. 

 New Delhi: The CBI on Wednesday put former Uttar Pradesh minister Mehrajuddin Ahmed through a lie detector test to prove his proximity to Meerut University lecturer Kavita Chaudhary, whose murder sparked a political furore.

 Mehrajuddin is not an accused but the CBI had stumbled upon a video showing him with the 29-year-old, who, police said, was involved in a sex-on-camera scandal. 

 Jammu: The alleged custody death of a teenager led to clashes between police and Jammu residents. Showkat Ali, 16, was picked up on Tuesday evening for questioning in a Rs 3-lakh burglary. On Wednesday morning, the police claimed he died of fits, Alis brother-in-law said.

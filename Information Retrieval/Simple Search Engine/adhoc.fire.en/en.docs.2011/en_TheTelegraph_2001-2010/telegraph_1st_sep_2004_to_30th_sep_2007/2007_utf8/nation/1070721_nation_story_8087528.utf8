 Bachchan: The heat 

 is on 

 July 20: Amitabh Bachchan cant possibly offer to donate the land he acquired in a Barabanki village because he does not own it, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati asserted today. 

 The remark comes days after the star wrote to the Pune divisional commissioner, expressing his desire to donate the Barabanki land to the local gram sabha and the plots in Punes Maval to the original farmers.

 Is he (Bachchan) the owner? How can he donate when he does not own them? Mayavati asked. 

 The chief minister, speaking after a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Delhi this morning, denied receiving the letter offering to donate the land in Daulatpur village to the government, apparently to build a school. We have not received any letter from Bachchan, she said.

 The Faizabad commissioner had cancelled the allotment on June 1 on the ground that Bachchan had bought the land by falsely claiming to be a farmer, but Allahabad High Court stayed the order.

 Bachchans lawyer, Ajay Shukla, claimed he handed the letter to the sarpanch of Daulatpur village on July 12. Munnu Singh, the husband of sarpanch Durga Devi, said he received the letter. 

 It was given by a Samajwadi Party leader, an advocate, saying it was from the actor. The letter, I was told, has a proposal to set up a school. I sent it to the chief minister, Singh said. 

 Barabanki district magistrate L. Johri denied having received a letter. If an official letter for return of land comes from anyone, it is supposed to be routed through my office, she said.

 But Amir Haider, a Barabanki advocate who had filed a case against Jaya Bachchan for concealing details about the land in her affidavit filed for the Rajya Sabha polls as a Samajwadi Party candidate, said the star was free to donate two of the three plots in his possession. According to him, it was only the third plot that was disputed and, therefore, could not be donated. 

 Panchayat leaders in Daulatpur said the letter did not specify which slice of land was to be given back to the government.

 The letter only says the Bachchans want to give away all land in Barabanki, said Gautam Saini, a panchayat member. 

 As the controversy rages, some villagers appeared happy that the land could be used for a school. Panchayat members today met district magistrate Johri and urged her to clear the proposal. But, in the absence of any letter, she was not in a position to spell out the administrations stance. 

 Yeh to bahut hi nek kadam hai (it is a very good step), said Punjabi Singh, who has a plot adjacent to the Bachchans disputed land.

 Fresh purchase

 Bachchan has bought two acres of fresh land in Daulatpur to set up a school named after his father Harivansh Rai Bachchan, an agency report said.

 The deal was signed about six days ago, said Vinay Kumar Shukla, who holds the power of attorney for the star.

 According to Shukla, Bachchan bought the plots to honour the sentiment of villagers, who wanted him to retain his relationship with the village.

 It was not possible to set up the school on the land bought earlier because of the legal problems, he said.

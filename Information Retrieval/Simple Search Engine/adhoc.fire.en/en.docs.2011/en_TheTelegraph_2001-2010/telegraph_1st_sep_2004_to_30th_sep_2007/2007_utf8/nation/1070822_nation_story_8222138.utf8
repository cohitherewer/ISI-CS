 Vajpayee in hospital, but stable

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: Atal Bihari Vajpayee was today admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences after he complained of dizziness and palpitation. Doctors said he was stable. 

 The 82-year-old former Prime Minister (in picture) will, however, remain under supervision for at least a day as a precautionary measure.

 Given his history of high blood pressure, the dizziness and palpitation could have been caused by any of several reasons, doctors said. 

 The culprit could be something he ate last night or how he slept, said a doctor at the AIIMS cardio-thoracic sciences department, where Vajpayee is being treated. 

 AIIMS sources said Vajpayee complained of nausea during a series of medical tests he undertook today. There are likely to be more tests tomorrow. 

 The results of all tests he undertook today are not ready. Only after doctors have scrutinised the results of all tests can he be released... if all is fine, AIIMS spokesperson Shakti Gupta said.

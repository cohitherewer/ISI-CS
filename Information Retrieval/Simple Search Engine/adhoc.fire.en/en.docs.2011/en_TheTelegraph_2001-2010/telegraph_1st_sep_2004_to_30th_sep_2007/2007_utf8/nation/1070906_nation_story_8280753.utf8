 Pill alert frees boy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Sept. 5: A kidnapped four-year-old boy suffering from fever and prone to fits was today found at a Khammam village after the names of medicines he had to take were broadcast on TV.

 Rohit Reddy was abducted last evening while playing with his brother and friends outside his Golden Tulips apartment by stalkers who scaled the compound wall and whisked him off in a black Toyota Qualis.

 Villagers of Tekulapalli, 300km from here, found him by the roadside and took him to the local police who informed his family who live in Hyderabads IT corridor.

 We spoke to him over the phone. He is in the safe custody of police. We are very happy, Rohits father G. Ravinder Reddy, a senior Cognizant Technology Solutions executive, said.

 The boy was freed hours after Rohits mother Lalasa, who works with Satyam Computers, appealed for his release on humanitarian grounds as he was ill.

 Tekulapalli police inspector T. Janardhan said Rohits parents had confirmed his identity and sent relatives to take him back to Hyderabad.

 According to Hyderabad police, the ploy to broadcast the names of medicines Rohit, a student of Maharishi Vidyalaya, had to take for convulsions had paid off. Through the mother, we telecast the names of the medicines --- Frisium 5mg and Meftal-P syrup --- to be given to the boy as he suffered from fits, a police officer said.

 He said the information forced the kidnappers to dump the boy, fearing his death in captivity.

 Khammam police said combing of the area where the boy was found had led to a Maoist hideout from where three suspects, including former Maoist leader Venkanna, were picked up.

 The boy has identified the three as his abductors, an officer said.

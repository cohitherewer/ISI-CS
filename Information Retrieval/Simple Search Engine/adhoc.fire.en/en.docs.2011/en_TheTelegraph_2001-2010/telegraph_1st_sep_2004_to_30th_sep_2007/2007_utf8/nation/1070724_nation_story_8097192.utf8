The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Mother of all brawls in Andhra Assembly

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, July 23: Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy today hurled at his predecessor Chandrababu Naidu a colloquial phrase that critics said could be interpreted to mean your mothers womb. 

 I will bare you completely. I will wash your dirty linen in public. You will regret to have been born. This is only a beginning. Wait for the real thing, Reddy said, according to official translation.

 A furore erupted with the Opposition saying the chief ministers turn of phrase in colloquial Telugu means you will regret having come out of your mothers womb.

 Reddy bellowed at Naidu after Telegu Desam Party members complained of police atrocity on party workers for raising questions about a mining contract in the chief ministers home district. 

 The House was adjourned but the din resumed when it reconvened. As many as 13 Desam members were suspended.

 Later, the chief minister denied having insulted Naidus mother. Reddy said he had only talked of making him regret for his life.

 Naidu said he was deeply hurt. Never in the past did any member talk in such a manner. It amounts to insulting mothers. We all adore our mothers, he said.

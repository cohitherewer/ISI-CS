 Murder in Guwahati lounge bar

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Guwahati, July 22: Blood flowed along with spirits in a Guwahati lounge bar-cum-restaurant last night.

 A bullet fired by the man he was having a conversation with over drinks killed sweet-shop owner Rajesh Kumar Shah, 30, around 11.45pm. 

 Tarun Baruah, another businessman, shot Shah after what looked like a heated exchange of words between them, police said.

 Music was blaring inside the lounge, one of the few that give the city a semblance of life after dusk, and the waiters were busy serving drinks and food when Baruah took Shah to a corridor and shot him from point-blank range. The bullet pierced Shahs cheek.

 The accused, a frequent visitor to the lounge bar, fled before anybody could react. He has been absconding since. 

 An employee of the bar said Baruah and Shah seemed to be arguing for the past half an hour.

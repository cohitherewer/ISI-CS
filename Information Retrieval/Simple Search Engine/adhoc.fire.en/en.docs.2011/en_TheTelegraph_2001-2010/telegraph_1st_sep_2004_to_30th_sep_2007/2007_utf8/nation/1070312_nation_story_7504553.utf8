 Lizs 7 rounds draw a blank

 Liz Hurley and Arun Nayar after landing in India

 New Delhi, March 11: Liz Hurley could have spared herself the exertion of walking round the fire seven times at Umaid Bhavan, especially after being on a diet of six raisins for weeks.

 For one thing, she was already married to Arun Nayar, having undergone a civil ceremony in England followed by a Christian blessing service.

 For another, any Hindu blessings she might have expected for her strenuous orbiting of the sacred fire, Sanskrit shlokas and all, can be safely written off.

 Both the parties to a marriage under the Hindu law (Hindu Marriage Act, 1955) have to be Hindus, Delhi High Court lawyer Arjun Bhandari said, adding that Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs also come within the fold.

 The lack of legal sanction to their second wedding ceremony would hardly bother the celeb couple the first one at Gloucesters Sudeley Castle has enough validity to go through any trial by fire. But even religious sanction is being withheld.

 The law would have been happy with a civil marriage, but Hinduism demands conversion, no less.

 If a couple wants to have a religious marriage governed by the Hindu personal law, the non-Hindu partner has to convert to Hinduism, a priest at Arya Samaj Mandir in Vasant Vihar said. Merely performing the customary Hindu ceremonies would not lend religious sanction to their relationship.

 Even mere conversion, it seems, wouldnt have made everyone happy. An astrologer has already declared Hurley a manglik the bearer of the Mars jinx that can be seen as a threat to her husbands well-being, with expiation lying in several trips to temples and a series of expensive rituals.

 If that were not enough, many in Jodhpur have found fault with the couple skipping some of the 16 ceremonies that may not be a must for all Hindu marriages but are necessary for a proper Marwari wedding.

 And some women have pointed to a blemish that no ritual not even diets of raisin and vegetable shakes can wash away. The bride is 41 years old.

 Bhandari, the Delhi lawyer, would not spare even the groom from scrutiny: Do we know for sure that Nayar is a Hindu?

 However, thats academic. The Hindu Marriage Act doesnt apply to foreigners, he said. So, a civil marriage is the only way out even for a Hindu tying the knot with a Hindu if one of them happens to be a foreign citizen.

 None of these knotty legal aspects are likely to be troubling the couple. The Umaid Bhavan show was probably meant to be just that a glittering assembly of bejewelled celebs, who came in their best dresses to be shown the pomp and splendour of an India few Indians have had the fortune to see.

 If the saat phere was a dud, the glitz parade the whole nine yards of it surely wasnt.

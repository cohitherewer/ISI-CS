 Bill blow for Azad

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Jammu, Jan. 16: Senior PDP leader Muzzaffar Hussain Baig today mobilised his partys MLAs to get an Opposition bill passed in the Assembly. The PDP is a partner in the Congress-led government headed by Ghulam Nabi Azad.

 All PDP MLAs, but one, voted for the National Conference bill, which proposes a stiffer sentence and higher fines for revenue officials guilty of issuing fake permanent resident certificates to people who arent natives of Jammu and Kashmir. The National Conferences Mehboob Beig moved the legislation.

 Beig argued that the existing fine of Rs 50,000 was too low to serve as a deterrent. He said the guilty officials should be sentenced to two years imprisonment and fined Rs 2 lakh.

 Junior revenue minister Prem Sagar Aziz opposed the bill, but chief minister Azad was not present in the House.

 The bill was passed after the National Conference and the PDP joined forces. 

 The bills passage is an embarrassment for the government. It has shown that even PDP ministers dont support the regime on some crucial issues.

 Rahul goes ballistic at goonda raj

 New Delhi, April 29: What the Mulayam Singh Yadav governments bark did not provoke, its bite has: a lashout from Rahul Gandhi who branded its regime in Uttar Pradesh goonda raj.

 Called a pig by senior minister Azam Khan last Thursday, Rahul hadnt reacted. Kapil Sibal, the Congress poll campaign in-charge, did not go ballistic either, dismissing it as another example of the Samajwadi Partys brand of low-level politics.

 But after Youth Congress president Ashok Tanwar and his colleagues were allegedly beaten up by policemen yesterday, Rahul hit out at Mulayam. 

 Uttar Pradesh is an example of goonda raj, he fumed, changing his roadshow plans to rush to Deoria in eastern Uttar Pradesh. The reaction has endeared him further to the state Congress, which has been banking on Rahul for a revival.

 So far, only BJP leaders like M. Venkaiah Naidu and Rajnath Singh had used the term goonda raj for the Mulayam regime. 

 Unusually strong words coming from him, said a member of Rahuls roadshow team.

 The young Nehru-Gandhi was in Delhi when he heard Tanwar, Pradeep Jaildar, Manish Dharnia and Rajpal Kharola were stopped in Deoria when they were on a sandesh yatra. 

 Tanwar was to address a news conference but before that, he was picked up by circle officer Chand Hussain, Rahul was told. The Congressmen were taken to a police station where they were allegedly roughed up.

 The Amethi MP decided to reschedule his roadshow he was to fly to Rajgarh in Mirzapur district and reached Deoria at noon. 

 A release mailed by Rahuls media cell quoted him as telling the local media: Our people were campaigning here, they had all the legal permission for the campaign. But they were beaten up relentlessly, this is not acceptable. Their legs have been broken. This is not fair.

 The goonda raj barb came in reply to a question. 

 Rahul asked the Mulayam government not to be partial and to please do their job and be fair. 

 They want to stop the Congress party, but I want to make it clear we are not going to stop, he said, adding he would complain to the Election Commission.

 Rahuls show of solidarity with the young workers appears to have galvanised the party in Deoria, which had slipped out of the Congresss hands in the 90s. 

 Akhilesh Pratap Singh, the party spokesperson who is fighting from Rudrapur in Deoria, said over phone: Rahuljis main message is that he is ready to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with the youths of the state. This incident gave him a chance to prove he means what he says. 

 After several years, our workers felt heres a national leader who is ready to stand by them in distress.

 This was not the first time Rahul departed from his schedule. When Munnalal Maurya, the Congress candidate from Khaga near Fatehpur, was killed in a road accident on Friday, he rushed to the spot in a couple of hours. 

 It was a personal blow for Rahul because Maurya was an educationist who had four or five colleges in this area. Anybody with a commitment for education endears himself to Rahul, said Pankaj Shanker, his media manager.

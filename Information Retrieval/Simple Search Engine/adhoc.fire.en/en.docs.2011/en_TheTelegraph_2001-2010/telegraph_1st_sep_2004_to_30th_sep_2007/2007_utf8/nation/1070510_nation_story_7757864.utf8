 Quota bench plea on hold

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR

 New Delhi, May 9: The Supreme Court division bench, which had stayed the OBC quota in higher education, today reserved its verdict on the Centres plea seeking transfer of all petitions to a larger bench.

 The Centre, which plans to introduce reservation for Other Backward Class students from this year, is expected to ask for the stay to be revoked if the order is in its favour and a larger bench is constituted in time.

 The division bench of Justices Arijit Pasayat and L.S. Panta said it would consider the legal issues suggested by parties to the case before referring the petitions. The judges sought a list of the issues by tomorrow.

 The bench also asked all parties to submit written submissions on their arguments for and against reservation in eight weeks.

 So, even if the larger bench is constituted, the Centres plea on revocation of the stay on the OBC quota can be listed for hearing only after two months, which could be too late.

 But if the chief justice announces the names of the judges who will be on the larger bench in the normal course, it should include Pasayat and Panta the Centre can ask for an earlier sitting. 

 After hearing contentions for and against referring the matter to a larger bench, the judges had asked all parties to come up with legal questions that the court might have to address while taking a decision.

 With several suggestions being submitted today, the bench asked solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati and senior counsel Harish Salve, who represented the anti-reservation group, to compile the issues and submit them before the court by tomorrow morning.

 The judges noted that the questions were of far-reaching consequences and added that all states and recognised political parties would be allowed to plead and put forth their arguments. 

 Former law minister Ram Jethmalani, appearing for the Rashtriya Janata Dal, joined the Centre in seeking adjudication by a larger bench as the matter was of great national importance.

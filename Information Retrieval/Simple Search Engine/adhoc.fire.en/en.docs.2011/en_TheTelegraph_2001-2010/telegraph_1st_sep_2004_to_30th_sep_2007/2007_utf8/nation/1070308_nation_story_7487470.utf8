The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Combat divide but rank restored

 SUJAN DUTTA

New Delhi, March 7: The chiefs of the armed forces have recommended exclusion of women officers from close combat roles where chances of physical contact with the enemy are high, defence minister A.K. Antony disclosed in a written reply in Parliament today, on the eve of International Womens Day.

 But since a row erupted after the Vice-Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Pattabhiraman, was quoted last year as saying that the army can do without women for which he subsequently apologised the force has rejigged its policy on women officers.

 A quiet restoration of rank to a lady officer, who was asked to relinquish her stripes after being ceremonially pipped on International Womens Day last year, epitomises the change. The ministers reply did not dwell on this aspect, but he listed the arms and services into which women are recruited as officers.

 Lieutenant Colonel Priyamvada Mardikar was the first woman in the army (non-medical and nursing corps) to be given the rank on March 8 last year. But she was humiliatingly stripped of her rank (reported in The Telegraph on June 24, 2006) because army headquarters concluded the honour was given erroneously. 

 News of the humiliation of Mardikar further embarrassed the defence ministry, already facing flak because of the vice-chiefs reported remarks, and the then defence minister Pranab Mukherjee (now external affairs minister) asked the Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC) to take a view on women in the armed forces.

 Antonys disclosure today of the COSCs view is a reflection of that study. Defence ministry sources said the study was carried out by the Integrated Defence Staff on instructions from the COSC. It has not recommended granting of permanent commission to lady officers. But it has said lady officers on Short Service Commission should be treated on a par with gentlemen officers under the scheme. Accordingly, the training programme for lady recruits to the Officers Training Academy in Chennai has been reworked.

 Even as the study was being done, the defence ministry took a decision on restoring parity between gentleman and lady officers recruited on Short Service Commission on July 20 last year. 

 It also abolished the Women Special Entry Scheme (WSES) introduced in 1997. Following that Priyamvada Mardikar has been returned her pips and she is now a lieutenant colonel.

 Lady officers in the medical corps and the nursing corps have gone on to become lieutenant generals in the past. These are the only two wings in which lady officers can claim permanent commission.

 In all other wings lady officers will continue to be eligible only for the Short Service Commission with a maximum tenure of 14 years with no option. Mardikar, an engineer, is in her last year of service and is currently posted in Mumbai. She retires this year. Gentlemen officers, if found eligible, have the option of seeking permanent commissions.

 Details of the study for the COSC are not publicly available. But the chiefs are understood to have taken the view that national policy on involvement of women in the combat arms such as in the infantry, on board warships or piloting fighter aircraft is yet to be structured.

 Among the cultural issues associated with the gender divide, there is also ambiguity on operational issues. Scenarios in which a woman may not be able to save lives by bodily lifting wounded soldiers under fire and in which she might be taken captive by an enemy illustrate only some of these issues.

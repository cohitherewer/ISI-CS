 Haneef wins visa battle, family still on toes

 Mohammed Haneef

 Aug. 21: A Brisbane court today overturned the decision to revoke Mohammed Haneefs work visa, saying the immigration minister had used a wrong criterion.

 Minister Kevin Andrews cancelled the visa by adopting a wrong criterion. He fell into jurisdictional error by applying the wrong test, federal court judge Jeffery Spender said.

 The verdict comes as another embarrassment to the Australian government after terror charges against the Indian doctor had to be dropped for lack of evidence.

 The judge also ordered the government to pay Haneef legal expenses. 

 The doctor will, however, have to wait to get a fresh visa as the court granted the government 21 days to respond to its ruling. This means Haneef cannot return to Australia now.

 Spender said Andrews should have ordered the visa cancellation on the ground that London police had informed Australian authorities that Haneef was a suspect. 

 Andrews, who had ordered the cancellation on July 16 on character grounds hours after Haneef was granted bail, defended his decision and said he would appeal.

 When I made the decision to cancel Haneefs visa, I made it in national interest and I stand by that decision, he said in Sydney amid rising criticism from rights bodies, lawyers forums and political parties.

 The Australian Greens party demanded that Andrews quit, saying he had tarnished the countrys reputation. Todays vindication of Haneef by the court makes Andrewss position as minister untenable, party senator Kerry Nettle said. 

 She urged the government to offer Haneef an apology and compensation.

 In Bangalore, Haneefs family welcomed the judgment, saying it was a victory of truth. We had reposed complete trust in Allah and He has ensured justice, Farhadh Jahan, Haneefs mother-in-law, said. 

 But Imran Siddiqui, the relative who travelled to Australia last month to secure Haneefs release, was wary of the appeal. We are ready to fight the legal battle ahead, he said, adding that the doctor was keen to go back to Australia and work.

 Farhadh said the family did not wish that Haneef should return, but added that it was his personal decision. Haneef did not step out to share his feelings. Siddiqui said the doctor had been advised not to speak to the media.

 The 27-year-old was arrested in Brisbane last month when he was about to leave for India and held for more than three weeks on the suspicion that he supported the failed UK terror plots. 

 Andrews said Haneef had an association with two of the British suspects, Sabeel and Kafeel Ahmed. 

 Haneef was charged with providing reckless support to a terrorist organisation because he gave his SIM card to one of his second cousins, Sabeel, when he left Britain in July last year. 

 Haneef claimed he gave the card so that Sabeel could use the extra minutes remaining on the plan, and had no idea of his cousins alleged involvement in the terror plots.

 British police have charged Sabeel with withhold- ing information that could have prevented the terror acts.

 Sabeels brother Kafeel died this month of burns sustained when he crashed an explosive-laden vehicle into Glasgow airport on June 30.

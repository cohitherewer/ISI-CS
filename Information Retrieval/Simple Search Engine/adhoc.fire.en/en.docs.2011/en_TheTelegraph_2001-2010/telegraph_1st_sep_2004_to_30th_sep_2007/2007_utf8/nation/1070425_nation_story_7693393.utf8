 HRD huddles, cant decide

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 24: Buoyed by the happy news from the courts, a confident Arjun Singh had said the issue of the stalled IIM admissions would be sorted out soon.

 At the end of the day, it still hadnt been.

 Human resource development ministry officials first went into a two-hour huddle and then drove to Arjuns residence for another hour-long meeting. 

 But the only result was an announcement that the minister would show his hand tomorrow.

 The Indian Institutes of Management expect the ministry to revoke the ban on the B-schools releasing their general-category admissions lists. The ministry would need to issue a fresh directive allowing the admission process to resume.

 The government, however, is likely to ask the institutes to keep a route open for admissions under the Other Backward Classes quota if the stay is lifted on May 8 or soon after.

 The hope that this might happen came today when the Chief Justice of India advanced the hearing of the challenge to the quotas validity to May 8. 

 This raised the possibility that the case may be handed over to a larger bench that might treat the central governments application against the stay more sympathetically.

 IIM officials said that if the ministry gave them the go-ahead in the next couple of days, they would manage without too many short cuts. Else, the time given to students to make their minds up about joining already likely to be cut from three weeks to two would be drastically reduced.

 The preparatory classes for Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe students, due to start from end-May before the academic session began in end-June or early July, would also have to be pruned.

 Ministry sources had said this afternoon that the government was in no hurry to revoke the ban on the general-category lists being released. But within a couple of hours, Arjun said the issue would be resolved.

 Later in the evening, the ministry refused to reveal what was said at the meetings. It merely said that the minister had been informed of all the facts about the expansions that were to have taken place at the IIMs.

 If the OBC quota is to be introduced from 2007-08, the B-schools will need to increase their seats. Each of them had worked out a plan to do that when the March 29 court stay on the quota made things uncertain.

 The IIMs had wanted to announce the general list after the court stayed the quota for the 2007-08 academic year. But the ministry had refused permission.

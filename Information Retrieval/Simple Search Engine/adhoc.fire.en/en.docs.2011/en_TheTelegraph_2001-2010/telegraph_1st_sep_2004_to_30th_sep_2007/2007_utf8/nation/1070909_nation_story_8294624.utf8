The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Its bijli, not Bush: Sibal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sibal

 Calcutta, Sept. 8: Kapil Sibal today came to Bengal with a message for the Left do not confuse Bush with bijli.

 The Union science and technology minister has been sent by the Congress to counter the CPMs campaign against the civilian nuclear deal.

 Sibal, a member of the UPA-Left committee to sort out differences on the deal, said the Left should not confuse (George W.) Bush with bijli and hold demonstrations when their representatives are on the panel to scan the agreement.

 Nobody has said that we are stopping the nuclear deal but the committee would take into account Left concerns. If the Left has a hidden agenda, the people of the country must know, he told a news conference at the state Congress headquarters.

 The minister said nuclear energy was necessary for the common man and the Left should not hold the country back. 

 The Lefts opposition, he added, was for the sake of opposition. We want to work with the Left and provide a stable government till its full term.

 The government wants Left leaders to sit across the table and hold talks, Sibal said. 

 We dont want the Left to be left out. We want them to be right in.

 The ministers comments came an hour after CPM Bengal secretary and Left Front chairman Biman Bose told a rally in Esplanade this afternoon that the agitation against the Indo-US deal would be stepped up because it would play havoc with the lives of people in the country.

 I am asking all our partymen to launch a vigorous campaign on the dangerous implications of the nuclear treaty. We wont allow our country to be subjugated by American imperialism and the people need to be explained this point, Bose said.

 Sibal dismissed such concerns. He said the Lefts fears that the Hyde Act, a US domestic law, would have an overriding effect on the nuke deal were unwarranted.

 The Lefts position on the Hyde Act aspect is constitutionally and otherwise erroneous. Article 6(2) of the American Constitution gives international treaties the status of law and is called the supreme law. 

 The 123 Agreement has nothing to do with the Hyde Act. The Lefts argument on this count is uninformed and unacceptable, the minister, who has plans to visit CPM-ruled Kerala and Tripura to counter the Lefts campaign, added.

 The minister said the 123 Agreement reflects Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs assurances to the Left.

 Now that the terms of the deal are in public domain, the Left is attacking it. The Left is not saying that the agreement does not reflect the assurances given by the Prime Minister in Parliament. All their arguments are based on anti-Americanism, Sibal said.

 He defended the UPA governments stand that the demand for nuclear energy would go up substantially and help reduce pollution caused by thermal plants.

 Sibal demanded that the Left explain:

 Why the Left thinks the 123 Agreement would impinge on Indias sovereignty;

 Which of the terms of the deal impact on Indias right to take independent decisions; 

 How India can be better off without the nuclear agreement.

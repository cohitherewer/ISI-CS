 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Kalam in comfort, minus power

 A.P.J. 

 Abdul Kalam doesnt want the trappings of power. Now, 

 he realises there isnt enough even to keep the lights 

 on.

 Kalam is in familiar comfort zone, having moved into the same Anna University guesthouse room and having found his old cook. He is also savouring small pleasures, like walking into his favourite Chennai eating joint.

 Within hours of landing here as Professor Kalam last month, he got a taste of a life more ordinary. Chennai is used to powerless evenings, but Kalam hasnt sweated in years. He was preparing for his lecture when lights went out one night. He wanted to spend some time in the verandah of the guesthouse. Z-plus security meant he couldnt. He was later shifted to Raj Bhavan.

 There was speculation the state government, unhappy with Kalam since he missed last months event to honour M. Karunanidhi for his 50 years as lawmaker, could have deliberately pulled the plug. But power board officials blamed faulty wiring in the guesthouse.

 Varsity cheap-coaching leap

 Coaching 

 classes for tough public exams dont necessarily come 

 at a heavy price. Jamia Milia Islamia University is offering 

 such a coaching, for civil services, that costs only Rs 

 250. A sum of Rs 1,000 deposited at admission time will 

 be returned at the end of the course. 

 Private institutes that dot Indias cities charge several thousands. The Jamia coaching will have credibility that a private institute lacks. We arent a fly-by-night operator, we are a central university. And it will be almost free, said Syed Humayun Zafar Zaidi, a professor at the Jamia Centre for Coaching and Career Planning. 

 The nine-month course will see ex-bureaucrats and teachers lecturing aspirants. Classroom teaching, mock tests and group discussions will be part of the grooming. The entrance exam will be conducted on August 8, followed by an interview. Only 35 seats are on offer.

 Vouchers for big schools

 Studying 

 in a good school is no longer just a dream for Naveen, Tanu, 

 and their friends. An NGO, the Centre for Civil Society, 

 has started what it claims is Delhis first school-voucher 

 scheme, funding poor children to enable them to study in 

 schools other than the government ones. 

 Last week, 408 children received the vouchers, each worth Rs 350 per month, for a period of three years from Sheila Dixit. The chief minister was evasive when asked if her government was considering a similar scheme. 

 Let us see how this scheme works first, she said, flashing her characteristic smile. The plan has its own share of critics. One grouse is that Rs 350 is not enough to pay the fees that some of the capitals best schools charge.

 Sceptics argue that the scheme doesnt address the basic problem of how the poor children will mingle with those from a more privileged background in elite schools.

 Beg your pardon

 If 

 Delhi High Court has its way, beggars caught from the mean 

 streets of the capital will be sent back to their home states.

 Judges at the court were told this week about a recent report that showed 95 per cent of the detained beggars werent from the capital. But existing laws under which they were held dont allow them to be sent back.

 The court said that Delhi police has more pressing issues to deal with and packing off the mendicants will leave them with more time to battle bigger crimes.

 The plea was filed by the Delhi Bar Association, which argued that begging had become a nuisance and a source of criminal activities.

 with funk, electronic dance music, with improvisation at

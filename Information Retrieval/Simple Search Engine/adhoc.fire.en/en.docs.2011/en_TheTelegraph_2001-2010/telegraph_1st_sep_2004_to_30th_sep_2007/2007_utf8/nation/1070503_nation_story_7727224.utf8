 Home for boy but none for girl

 - Families fight for custody of abandoned male baby, shun female

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Khandwa, May 2: A millionaire home for the abandoned boy, none for the baby girl.

 Even the tear-streaked cheeks of little Prerna failed to move the two wealthy families who had fought long and hard over Shivs custody.

 After the verdict was out, she remained where she was an unwanted, abandoned girl child.

 But destiny smiled on two-and-a-half-month old Shiv when the district collector handed him over to the Ahujas, a business family in Khandwa, some 250 km south of Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal.

 We have only God to thank, said a beaming Bhagwandas Ahuja. We have been issueless for 22 years and God has blessed us with Shiv when we had almost given up hope.

 I will take good care of him, promised Anjana, the smiling new mother.

 Shiv had been found abandoned in a compartment of the Ratlam-Hingoli Express on February 18. According to passengers, a woman had left the baby saying she would be back soon. 

 When she didnt return after several hours, the railway police were called in and the child was taken to Khandwa district hospital where a nurse named him Shiv.

 Another family from Mumbai, related to the private secretary of a state minister, also claimed the child and the matter reached court. A protracted legal battle followed between the two families the Ahujas and the Mumbai-based Gehlots. Today, Khandwa district court judge C.S. Tiwari granted Shivs custody to the Ahujas after hearing arguments from both sides.

 Lawyer Manish Gupta, who represented the Ahujas, said the court favoured his clients as they are a joint family. 

 The court observed that a joint family can take good care of the child which is not possible in a nuclear family. Since Bhagwandas Ahuja has two older brothers and there are two girl children in the family, the boy will get a good environment, Gupta said.

 Bhagwandas owns a transport firm and a part of the familys sugar business. He said he and Anjana had decided to adopt Shiv the moment they read about the child.

 We are devotees of Lord Shiva. So when we learnt that his name is Shiv, we instantly felt he was a blessing sent for us. So I applied for his custody.

 Asked what they would do if one fine morning Shivs biological parents decide to claim him, Gupta pointed to recent amendments to the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. 

 He said under the act, a child is free for adoption if he or she is abandoned for over two months by the biological parents.

 After this period, regaining custody is very difficult. Moreover, the parents will face criminal proceedings for abandoning the child, he said.

 Soon after the ruling, Shiv was seen smiling in the arms of his new father. A little distance away, Prernas tears wouldnt stop.

 Before the verdict, the judge had asked both the families if they wanted Prerna, who had been founded abandoned in a village fair on February 17.

 Both had declined.

 Jail officials get taste of own pill

 Some jail officials wont order anyone around, at least for some time. 

 Deputy superintendent of police K.S. Meena, assistant superintendent Dhananjay Rawat and constable Mangey Ram, used to wielding the stick on inmates of Tihar jail, now find themselves on the wrong side of the bars.

 Accused of extorting money from Tihar inmates and battering them with rods and sticks if they refused, the officials have been sent to a cell in the same jail. Christopher James, a Patna resident sentenced to three years in jail in a case of cheating, had complained to the court of additional chief metropolitan magistrate that the three beat him up last September after he refused to hand them Rs 5,000. 

 Till they get bail, inmates are likely to teach them a thing or two. This concern was clearly on Meenas mind, as he asked judge Kamini Lau for a cell in a far corner of the jail. His plea was rejected.

 No raise, no clean-up

 A government complex is choking under mounds of mess not cleared for a week because the men tasked with keeping it clean are raising a stink over pay packages.

 The contractor supposed to clean up BR Bhavan, an 80-room building that houses the offices of senior IAS and IPS officers in Andhra Pradesh, isnt picking up the broom till his 120 men are given better PF and health insurance benefits.

 But the road and buildings department, which manages the complex, isnt listening. Who asked him to quote the lowest if he knew of the extra costs before he finalised the deal with us? asked an official. The contractor was picked after he quoted the least price for the job. The 1,200 employees in the building contribute their bit to the two tonnes of waste swept out each day. 

 In the first few days after the problem began, many thought the stench was coming from Hussainsagar Lake, next to the complex. It didnt take long for them to find out the real source.

 But not everyone is upset at all the mess. We hope there will be fewer visitors because of the garbage, said a worker on strike.

 Spat clears successor air

 The DMKs succession secret appears to have tumbled out not in a secretly drafted will, as some might think, but in an Assembly duel.

 It began during a debate last week on grants for an omnibus ministry it oversees local administration, rural development and water supply that is under M.K. Stalin, the younger son of DMK patriarch and chief minister M. Karunanidhi.

 ADMK legislator K.P. Anbazhagan provoked the exchange, making a snide remark that some political parties he didnt name the DMK have a habit of handing weighty portfolios to successors. Reading the comment for what it was, the normally low-profile Stalin retorted, saying successors are named where there are people to pass the baton to. The allusion was to ADMK boss Jayalalithaas single status. 

 Gem of a cabbie

 Cabs in Mumbai are among the countrys more reliable ones and drivers arent too rude either, but finding something youve left behind still needs a lot of luck.

 In a rare instance of honesty, a cab driver returned a bag with jewellery worth over Rs 6 lakh and a loaded revolver to a businessman whod forgotten them in his vehicle.

 Narendra Mehta took Kalid Khans taxi from Zaveri Bazaar in south Mumbai to his home in Malabar Hill. When he stepped out, he forgot his bag containing the valuables. 

 The 39-year-old driver saw the bag on the back seat when he got home. Khan drove back to Malabar Hill police station and handed the bag. Mehta couldnt have been luckier.

 Ragging whip

 New Delhi, May 20: The University Grants Commission is bracing itself to implement the stringent recommendations of the anti-ragging commission on campuses across the country, reports our special correspondent.

 On Wednesday, the Supreme Court accepted the Raghavan committees report, one of which seeks amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code so that such cases get fast-track treatment.

 We are awaiting the findings of the Raghavan committee report. Once it comes, we will circulate it to the universities, said T.R. Kem, the secretary in the UGC, which has 275 universities under it.

 The panel headed by former CBI director R.K. Raghavan has also sought amendments to the Indian Penal Code, making ragging a punishable offence. It wants changes in the evidence act to make ragging compatible with the new rules. 

 The apex court has favoured the lodging of an FIR, in case the victim or guardian is not satisfied with the action taken.

 Recently, the court also ruled that it was upon educational institutions to file an FIR with police if an incident of harassment is brought to their notice.

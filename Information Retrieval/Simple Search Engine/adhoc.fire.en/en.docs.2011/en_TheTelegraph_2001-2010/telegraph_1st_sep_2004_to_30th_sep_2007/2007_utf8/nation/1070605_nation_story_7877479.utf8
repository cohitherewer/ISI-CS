 Gandhis voice from the past 

 AMIT ROY 

 The draft of Gandhis article and Albin Schram, the Austrian banker

 London, June 4: A draft of an article by Mahatma Gandhi, written only 19 days before his assassination on January 30, 1948, and pleading for toleration of Muslims in the newly Partitioned India, is expected to fetch between 9,000 and 12,000 (Rs 7. 2 and 9. 6 lakh) at an auction at Christies in London. 

 The article is among 570 handwritten documents, mostly letters, collected by Albin Schram, an Austrian banker, over 30 years. He kept them hidden in the drawers of a filing cabinet at home. 

 When he died in 2005, his family was surprised to make the discovery. It really is an incredibly dense, very carefully researched collection, said Thomas Venning, director in Christies books department and a specialist in signed letters. To get a collection of letters like this nowadays is really a one-off, its almost unheard of. 

 Christies say the auction on July 3 will be offered through five sections: history; literature; art, science and philosophy; and music and theatre. The sale is expected to realise about 2 million with individual estimates ranging from 500 to 120,000.

 Gandhis words are poignant, as though his spirit has returned to admonish modern India of nine per cent GDP growth. 

 Signed MK Gandhi on January 11, 1948, it is a seven-page draft of an article, Urdu Harijan, which includes a number of corrections and cancellations, suggesting he was very troubled about the direction India was taking. 

 He discusses the Urdu script and the Hindu treatment of Muslims in newly independent India. According to Christies, which has recognised the historical significance of the document, Gandhi announces his regret at having to discontinue the publication of his mouthpiece, Harijan, though he sees it as inevitable because of the dwindling demand the dwindle was to me a sign of resentment against its publication. Gandhi goes on: My view remains unalterable especially at this critical juncture in our history. It is wrong to ruffle Muslim or any other persons feeling when there is no question of ethics. 

 Gandhi founded Harijan in 1933, originally in order to deal with the question of untouchability. The article was written for the journal during the period of intercommunal tension which followed the Partition of India.

 He underscores the advantage of learning the Urdu script: The limitations of this script in terms of perfection are many. But for elegance and grace it will equal any script in the world. 

 He considers the potential of Urdu for shorthand and for the transcription of Sanskrit verses. He says that any suggestion of a boycott of the Urdu script is a wanton affront upon the Muslims of the Union who in the eyes of many Hindus have become aliens in their own land. This is copying the bad manners of Pakistan with a vengeance. 

 His article ends with a ringing call to Muslim friends not only to support the Urdu script but to learn the Nagari script and thus enrich their intellectual capital. 

 The day after the article was written, Gandhi announced his last fast in protest against communal violence. 

 Christies says the letters and documents are by many of the most notable figures of European history from the 13th to the 20th centuries, including Lord Byron, Winston Churchill, Charles Dickens, Elizabeth I, Sigmund Freud, Napoleon, Sir Isaac Newton, Oliver Cromwell, Claude Monet, Oscar Wilde and Charlotte Bronte.

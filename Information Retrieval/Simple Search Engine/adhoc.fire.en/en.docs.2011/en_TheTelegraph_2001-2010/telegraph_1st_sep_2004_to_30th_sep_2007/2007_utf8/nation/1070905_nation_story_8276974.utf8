 Hyderabad, Sept. 4: Some of the RDX smuggled from Bangladesh ahead of last months twin blasts has been shifted to Nalgonda, a suspect has told police.

 The pointers to Nalgonda, 110km from Hyderabad and home to many Islamic institutions, emerged during the narco analysis test on Imran in a Bangalore forensic lab, Hyderabad police sources said.

 Nalgonda also came under the glare after the arrest of local cleric Abdul Rahman for his alleged involvement in the December 2005 attack on the Indian Institute of Science. 

 He (Imran) has confessed to giving shelter, organising transport, providing SIM cards, hiring taxis and buying tickets for them (the bombers), a police source said. More leads could emerge after the narco test on Shakeel alias Sameer. His brain-mapping was done this evening. 

 Sleuths are helping Nalgonda police locate the RDX, which could be around 5kg. 

 Earlier, the police picked up Riyaz Khan, believed to be a member of the Indian Muslim Mohammadi Mujahideen, a little-known outfit.

 Rafzani not a medic

 Vellore police have said Shahi Rafzani, the Bangladeshi held in the case, was a student of a district college, and not Christian Medical College.

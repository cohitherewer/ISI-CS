 Tongue for goddess

 Jammu, April 11 (Reuters): A jobless devotee was admitted to hospital after he cut off his tongue and offered it to a goddess, police said today.

 Doctors stitched the wound but said the man, identified as Suresh Kumar, 24, may not be able to speak again.

 The incident took place yesterday evening when Kumar visited a temple dedicated to Kali on the outskirts of Jammu. Inside the temple, he cut his tongue off with a knife and gave it to the priest to offer it to the deity. He was immediately rushed to hospital.

 I am a true disciple of the goddess and it is my firm belief which has given me the strength to offer my tongue to her, he wrote on a piece of paper when reporters visited him in hospital.

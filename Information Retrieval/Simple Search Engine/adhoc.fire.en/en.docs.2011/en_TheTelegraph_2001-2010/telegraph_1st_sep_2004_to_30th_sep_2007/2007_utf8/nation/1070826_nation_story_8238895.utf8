 Tata strikes blow for nuclear deal

 Ratan Tata

 New Delhi, Aug. 25 (PTI): Ratan Tata has said if the nuclear deal with the US does not finally take off, it would be a serious setback for India and could affect flow of foreign direct investment into the country.

 The comments came during an interview on CNN-IBN, in which the industrialist said the civilian nuclear agreement was, in many ways, the best possible thing for India in a long time.

 I believe the only people happy to see this not happening are probably Pakistan and China, he added.

 On the impact on FDI inflow, Tata said it was possible because there could be repercussions and reactions.

 The tycoon, who took over Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus earlier this year, said the political system needed to change and take a fresh look at ideologies. 

 Asked if the Left, which is opposing the nuke deal, needs to reinvent itself, he avoided a direct reply. We all need to reinvent ourselves, he said. Even the Vatican reinvents itself.

 He hit out at political parties for opposing for the sake of opposing. I really do wish we could go back to the days when we had stronger coalitions or single parties in government and a two-party system in the House where you really dealt with issues and serious ideologies, he said.

 But Tata, whose small car project in Singur is facing stiff political opposition, had a word of praise for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and said it was because of the Bengal chief minister that the company had not moved out of the state.

 A lesser person would have succumbed to the political pressures. And let me tell you what that would have done... I would have just picked up my stakes and gone to another state. Three, four states are wooing us for that project, he said.

 Tata said if a chief minister risked his political position to stand by what he had promised, then he, too, would stand by him, and added that he had seldom met a chief minister more sincere in his desire to improve his state than the Bengal Marxist.

 BJP lands portal punch on Pratibha

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 10: The BJP today unveiled a website questioning Pratibha Patils candidature for the presidential polls.

 This site, www.knowpratibhapatil.com, is touted as an encyclopaedia of sorts on the Left-UPA candidate, who has a clear advantage in numbers against Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. 

 The BJP hopes to remove Shekhawats arithmetical disadvantage by getting a lead in what is billed as a war of public perceptions. 

 This is the first time a political party has launched a portal not to promote a personality or an ideology, but to put down a candidate from a rival formation in an election. 

 The caption on the home page of the BJP portal is India diminished, Indians disgraced. Scripted against a backdrop of a picture showing a smiling Sonia Gandhi clasping Pratibhas hand tightly, it asks: Does this lady, handpicked by Sonia Gandhi, deserve to become the President of India?

 The website was launched by BJP leader Arun Jaitley at party colleague M. Venkaiah Naidus home amid fanfare. The event showed the BJP shedding its insistence on projecting Shekhawat as an Independent candidate and its readiness to jump on the frontline of the battle against the Congress and Sonia. 

 As the site made the BJPs campaign against Pratibha shriller, Manipur MP and former chief minister Rishang Keishing urged L.K. Advani to refrain from the smear campaign against the UPA-Left candidate. 

 But he couched a mild barb in the appeal. That (halting the campaign) might be too much to expect of you or of the party and the Sangh, to which you belong, Keishing said.

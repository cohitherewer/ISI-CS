 The Buzz in Big Cities

 Lage Raho tests jail brains

 Before he gave Gandhi a quaint edge, Munnabhai had been showing thugs short cuts to clear in make-or-break exams. But some from his old tribe, now in jail, wont have it easy as they face posers ironically, on Gandhian ideals. 

 risoners of Kalyan jail on Saturday tried answering objective-type questions in an 80-marks paper on Gandhis principles. They need 30 marks to pass. The exam is part of a programme organised by Bombay Sarvodaya Mandal, Gandhi Study Centre and Kalyans Birla College to mark Gandhis 59th death anniversary. The rewards: a certificate for all those who appear, and khadi clothes to top four scorers. The bonus: a special screening of Lage Raho Munnabhai.

 Hook, line and sinker

 He had contributed a grain of sand to the bridge from which Ram mounted his Lanka offensive. Now, as he cringed watching dredging vessels run amok over the mythical bridge off the Rameshwaram coast, the squirrel whod earned a pat from the Lord himself was wondering what things had come to. Recently, however, there appeared to be some divine intervention. Aquarius, a Dredging Corp vessel, found its spud broken when it tried to slice through the bridge, believed to be buried under the coral reefs in the shallow sea. Then, Thangam, a 150-tonne floating crane, arrived to retrieve the broken spud, but saw its locking device collapse. Officials now have their hopes pinned on Hanuman a 200-tonne crane. The Lord might bless this one.

 Biryani bites Down Under

 The aroma from Hyderabad House, a renowned biryani maker in the city of the Nizams, will soon waft through Sydney and Saudi Arabias Al Kobhar. The eatery famed for its dum-ka-biryani and mirchi-ka-salan is cooking up franchisee deals that will take it overseas.

 Owner Zubair Mazharuddin says the Saudi Arabia and Australia outlets will open by the month-end. Not only spices, but cooks will be ferried to give overseas customers a taste of what Hyderabad is best known for. The aim is to take the chain to 15 other nations. If he succeeds, Zubair could see his Rs 10-crore annual sales rise five-fold. Other Hyderabadi temptations, like kebabs, nahari and paya, will also be on the menu abroad. We will also offer an array of dishes popular with vegetarians, Zubair said.

Mumbai: Catch five-time Grammy winner Buddy Guy (American blues and rock guitarist and singer) at the Johnnie Walker One Tree Music Festival on the MMRDA Grounds in Bandra-Kurla Complex on Sunday. Tickets at Planet M outlets and Rhythm House for Rs 600. Show starts at 7.30 pm.

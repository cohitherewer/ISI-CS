 Patil ahead in President race

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 New Delhi, June 8: Union home minister Shivraj Patil is set to be the countrys next President if Congress sources close to the high command are to be believed.

 Patil has remained tight-lipped but a peacock dancing outside his 4 Janpath residence this evening summed up the mood inside.

 Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, till recently the front-runner for the post, has taken over as the Congresss chief negotiator for the presidential polls, signalling he is out of the race.

 The partys crack team of negotiators which includes Ahmad Patel, A.K. Antony, Motilal Vora and Janardhan Dwivedi has sounded almost all United Progressive Alliance partners on Patil.

 The feedback hasnt been too disappointing but Left and Nationalist Congress Party leaders are said to be not too enthusiastic.

 Informally, the NCP leadership raised three reservations. One, Patil had lost the 2004 Lok Sabha polls from Latur. Two, in a long career he has held only two major posts Lok Sabha Speaker from 1991-96 and Union home minister since 2004. Three, he has been an ineffectual home minister.

 But NCP spokesman D.P. Tripathi later clarified that his party would go along with the UPA once the Congress named its candidate.

 Several top Left leaders such as Sitaram Yechury and Prakash and Brinda Karat are out of the country. Sources said the Left would give its structured and considered opinion when they returned from Israel and the US.

 Many senior Congress leaders are surprised at Sonias choice of Patil. A few suggested this was perhaps guru dakshina (teachers fees), for Patil had helped Sonia shape up as an able parliamentarian between 1999 and 2004.

 The former Lok Sabha Speaker had enlightened the then first-time MP on the nuances of parliamentary practices. He had briefed her on key issues and often acted as an intermediary between Sonia, then the leader of the Opposition, and the ruling National Democratic Alliance in his capacity as deputy leader of the House.

 Also, Patils relatively less controversial past, loyalty and his thrust on probity and procedure seem to have impressed the Congress chief.

 Congress sources said Motilal Vora had been a contender but his age went against him.

 It was the indispensable tag that scuttled Pranabs chances. Sources said Sonia personally communicated to the foreign minister that the party was unable to spare him for Rashtrapati Bhavan.

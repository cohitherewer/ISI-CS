 Orphan bloom finds root

 G.S. MUDUR 

 Rafflesia: Tiny kin

 New Delhi, Jan. 12: Scientists have identified the family of the worlds largest, yet mysterious orphan, flower discovered about 180 years ago by East India Company officials in the rainforests of Sumatra. 

 The blood red coloured Rafflesia, which can grow one metre wide and looks and smells like rotting flesh, belongs to the family of plants that produce castor oil, rubber and cassava, US scientists have said.

 Botanist Charles Davis at Harvard University and his colleagues used genetic studies to show that the closest relatives of the giant flower belong to a family of plants whose flowers are tiny, just millimetres across. 

 Their findings, published today in the US journal Science, indicate that Rafflesias flowers have grown 79-fold over the past 46 million years. 

 This flower looks almost extra-terrestrial. And no one has been brave enough to speculate where it might fit in the tree of plant life, Davis, an assistant professor at Harvard University, said.

 Its what we call a carrion mimic, and may be repulsive to people, Davis said in a telephone interview. It looks and smells like rotting meat and even generates some heat, but these features lure carrion flies which are pollinators.

 The scientists believe the accelerated increase in the size of the Rafflesia flowers is one of the most dramatic size changes observed in the plant and animal kingdoms. If humans grew at a comparable pace, Davis said, an adult would be 146 metres tall the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza. 

 Rafflesia is a strange plant that does not have leaves, stems, or even roots, but lives as a parasite, extracting nutrition from another plant in the grapevine family. 

 Although scientists routinely use genetic analysis to cluster plants and animals into families, the hunt for a family for Rafflesia has been frustrating as it lacks the genes involved in photosynthesis the hallmark of most plants. 

 It was discovered 180 years ago by Sir Stamford Raffles, governor of the East India Company in Sumatra and Joseph Arnold, a naturalist. Arnold, who later died of malaria during the expedition, had described the flower as the greatest prodigy of the vegetable world. 

 Davis and his colleagues had to probe deep into the genome of Rafflesia looking for genes to help establish its ancestry. Because Rafflesia has abandoned photosynthetic genes, we had to look at other parts of the plants genome.

 There are about 50 species of Rafflesia flowers.

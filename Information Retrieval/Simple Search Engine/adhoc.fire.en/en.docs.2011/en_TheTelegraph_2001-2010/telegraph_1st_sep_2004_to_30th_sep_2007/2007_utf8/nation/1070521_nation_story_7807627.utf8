 Cannes, May 20: Cannes is starting to be a family affair for the Bachchans. After the daughter-in-law comes the father-in-law.

 Tomorrow is a big day for the Big B, who is apparently making his first visit to Cannes.

 Amitabh Bachchan is coming for the world premiere of his new comedy, Cheeni Kum, in which he plays a 64-year-old London chef who falls for a woman of 34 (her father is younger than him).

 Amitji first time! confirmed his host, Kishore Lulla, chairman and CEO of Eros International, whose production and distribution company was set up 30 years ago this week and who has himself been coming to Cannes for 20 years.

 Although Cheeni Kum is neither in competition nor getting an official screening from the festival authorities, Bachchans visit will not go unnoticed by the media.

 Cannes will create awareness for Cheeni Kum worldwide, enthused Lulla.

 After five consecutive visits, Aishwarya has worked out how to get media attention. She introduced her husband, Abhishek, to the red carpet five days ago.

 Aishwarya has managed to get a little business done while she was here. The Cannes trade press is reporting that a long-delayed international project, Singularity, written by Roland Joffe (director of City of Joy and The Killing Fields), is about to be revived.

 The story is about a British officer in colonial India who falls in love with an Indian woman (Aishwarya) and an American marine biologist struggling to save his research partner trapped in the wreckage of a merchant ship.

 Belgium-based Corsan has agreed to a $35-million funding deal with Indias Neelmudra Entertainment. Filming is due to begin in January in India and South Africa. The plot is set across two time periods and continents.

 According to Corsan World Sales, which is representing Singularity in Cannes, the film will be ready for release before the end of 2008. It is expected to feature Hollywood star Brendan Fraser opposite Aishwarya.

 Tomorrow, though, Cannes will belong to Bachchan and Bachchan to Cannes. He will meet the media on board the Cest la vie (Thats Life), the gracious yacht Lulla has hired for Cannes. Earlier today, Lulla took his buyers for a little sail in near-perfect weather.

 Even without such hospitality, his buyers are more receptive these days to his sales pitch.I remember when I came 20 years ago, people would not even look at Indian cinema, he recalled. Now at least there is respect.

 As for Bachchan, he is the biggest ambassador the country has today for promoting Indian cinema. He is a legend. We are proud to have him. We always take pride in bringing Indian cinema. We brought Shah Rukh Khan first for Devdas. We brought Aishwarya. We brought Ajay (Devgan) and Saif (Ali Khan) for Omkara. Now we are bringing Mr Bachchan.

 Since Eros launched on the London Stock Exchange in June last year, its shares have gone up in value from 1.76-4. We have very happy shareholders, he enthused. We have to take Indian cinema to the world, to the different markets and convince them that Indian cinema will be on a par with Hollywood.

 There will be a direct clash tomorrow, though. A Mighty Heart, starring Angelina Jolie as Mariane Pearl, the widow of American journalist Daniel Pearl, also receives its eagerly anticipated world premiere tomorrow.

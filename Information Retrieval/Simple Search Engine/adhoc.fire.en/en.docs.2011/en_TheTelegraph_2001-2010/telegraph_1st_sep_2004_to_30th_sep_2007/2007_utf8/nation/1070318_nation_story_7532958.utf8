Adhikarypara (Nandigram), March 17: Shot in the leg and presumed dead, 19-year-old Moni Rana had been packed into a gunny bag and dumped in a police jeep with four other bloodstained bodies.

 When the jeep reached the Tamluk hospital morgue and the cops dragged the bag out, they heard a moaning sound. Once the bag was untied, a startling sight awaited them. Moni was alive.

 For the 19-year-old, the real ordeal began after a police bullet hit his leg at Adhikarypara village on Wednesday. He slumped to the ground unconscious. When he regained his senses, he was on his way to the morgue, 60 km away, with corpses for company. 

 The boy has now been admitted to hospital.

 He ran as soon as the police opened fire at the gathering, but could not go far because a bullet hit his left leg. He collapsed where another man was lying with a bullet wound in his chest. Then I fled, said Prabir Das, Monis neighbour. Das hid in a mud hut nearby, from where he watched two police vehicles roaring in. 

 Moni, in a T-shirt and lungi, was not moving. After throwing four bodies into the vehicle, two policemen caught hold of Monis legs and dragged him to a jeep as if it was a dead body. A policeman took out a gunny sack and put Moni into it before throwing him into the vehicle.

 According to another witness, Ganpathi Dhara, everyone had assumed Moni had died. We immediately ran to his house and told his sister Purnima about the tragedy.

 Purnima said she was informed around 2 pm that her brother had been killed by policemen.

 My husband Amal Rana had fled from the village fearing police torture. I didnt know what to do. We could not go to Nandigram because the entire area had been surrounded by policemen, she said.

 Unaware that their dead neighbour was alive, residents of Adhikarypara went from the Nandigram health centre to the Tamluk hospital morgue looking for Moni. But he was not among the dead. Suddenly, one of my friends ran out from the hospital ward and told me Moni was lying on one of the hospital beds, said one of them. 

 A doctor said the police had brought the wounded teenager. He was bleeding profusely. There was a deep wound on his left leg. He had to be operated upon immediately. Now his condition is stable.

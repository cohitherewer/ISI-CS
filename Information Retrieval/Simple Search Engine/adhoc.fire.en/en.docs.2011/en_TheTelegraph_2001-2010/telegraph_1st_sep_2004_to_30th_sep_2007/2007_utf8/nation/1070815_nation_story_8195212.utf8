 Slums to Chevrolet

 Mumbai, Aug. 14: This is the first time anyone in Babu Chhokas family will celebrate Independence Day.

 The plumber, whose debt-ridden family migrated from Bihar to Mumbai in the 1970s, is one of Indias new band of land millionaires. Last week, he sold his run-down 500sqft tenement to a land shark for Rs 1.4 crore. 

 He readily admits the land didnt belong to him: it was leased to his father in the 1980s by the government under a slum rehabilitation scheme.

 But who cares? The money is with me and the builders believe they can sort it out with the authorities.

 Chhoka defends himself with two clichs that justify almost anything.

 Number one: Why shouldnt I? What has the government done for us?

 But the land he just sold came from the government, didnt it?

 Not at all. We grabbed the land. They legalised it by giving us lease rights because they wanted our votes. If they want it again, they better legalise this sale as well, says Chhoka, flaunting the greatest power a citizen wields in independent India.

 Number two: Everybodys doing it.

 He cites the deals his neighbours in Mumbais Bharat Nagar slums have cut with builders.

 Bharat Nagar is prime land, located next to the posh new destination of big companies. The Bandra-Kurla Complex, with its mammoth steel-and-glass structures, can compete with some of the worlds best business districts.

 For the 9,000-odd slum tenants, turning crorepatis overnight thanks to the skyrocketing land prices in Mumbai, the trickle-down effect of the new Indian economy is a reality.

 Those who could hardly afford two square meals a day now drive fancy cars and are talking about buying flats in the suburbs, says Chhokas 60-year-old neighbour Nazuddin Patwari, who has seen the city change beyond recognition.

 No one came to Bandra-Kurla 40 years ago. It was marshy wasteland. Now look around you its a goldmine, he says.

 In the 1980s, about 3,000 slum dwellers were given tenancy rights by the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority. Many have illegally added floors to their tenements and rented them out.

 Now they are selling the plots themselves. But few of them are willing to talk about the illegal deals.

 Its not possible to keep a tab on personal transactions between the buyer and the seller. Under the law, a legal owner can sell his premises but when the same plot is developed under the SRA (Slum Rehabilitation Authority), his tenancy rights in the new construction are revoked, says SRA chief executive officer Debashish Chakravarty.

 But then, land and slums are usually political issues. It is up to the ministers and the local peoples representatives to decide what should be done.

 Chhoka knows what hes going to do: he will take his family out tomorrow in his Chevrolet Optra. Well watch the Prime Ministers address on our new plasma TV and then go to Essel World, he grins.

 My wife wants to cap it with dinner at a five-star hotel. Lets see. I keep telling her that these places are full of snobs. We may have the money, but theyll still throw us out, Chhoka shakes his head.

 Bourgeois tag on Left

 SANJAY K. JHA

 Bhopal, Sept. 21: Indias communists have been called many names but todays label of bourgeois was probably a first.

 BJP president Rajnath Singh dubbed the Left the new bourgeoisie for what he saw as its duplicity in propping up the UPA government while staying fiercely opposed to its policies.

 Marxists see the capitalist bourgeoisie as their main enemy and describing a Marxist as bourgeois is a bit like calling an ultra-orthodox Jew a Nazi.

 However, in the rhetoric of communist parties, the adjective bourgeois not only denotes a social class but is also used as an insult, signifying superficiality, lack of authenticity and hypocrisy. It was this sense that Rajnath seemed to be trying to exploit.

 The manner in which the Left parties are continuously enjoying the benefits of power without accountability is peculiar. Over the last one-and-a-half years, the Left Front has probably not won even a single seat in the Assembly elections and municipal corporations, the BJP chief said at the inauguration of the partys three-day national executive.

 However, given the manner in which the Left as a super-national party is bulldozing its point of view on every national policy makes one wonder whether, in a complete antithesis, it has moved away from the concept of Marxism and emerged as the new political bourgeoisie.

 The BJP chief found the communists hypocritical on many counts. He said the Lefts opposition to the Indo-US nuclear deal, unlike the BJPs, was based on prejudices and recalled that the CPM had supported the Chinese nuclear tests in 1964 but opposed the Pokhran tests in 1998. 

 He added that the Left was never interested in Indias strategic weapons programme.

 The CPM has recently faced unexpected insults from political opponents. 

 In citadel Kerala last July, a financial scandal involving CPM mouthpiece Deshabhimani led to state Congress chief Ramesh Chennithala dubbing it a party of thieves.

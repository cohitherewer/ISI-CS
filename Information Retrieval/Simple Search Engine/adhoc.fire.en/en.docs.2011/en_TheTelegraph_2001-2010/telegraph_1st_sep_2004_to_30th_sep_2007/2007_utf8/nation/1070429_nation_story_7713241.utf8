 Bad back keeps Atal away from booth

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 28: Atal Bihari Vajpayee was missing from Uttar Pradesh through most of the election campaign. Today, a bad back prevented him from casting his vote in Lucknow.

 The former Prime Ministers Lucknow trip was called off yesterday a day ahead of the fifth round of polling for the Assembly and Vajpayee stayed put at his Delhi home.

 An aide described the ache as a sprain on the right side of the back. There was a problem with his back and last evening, the doctor asked him to call off the trip, he said.

 The BJP leaders near-total absence from the campaign scene in Uttar Pradesh so far has been attributed to bad health by some and by others to his rivalry with party president Rajnath Singh. 

 Vajpayee had been more active during last years municipal-level polls in the state.

 At the beginning of the campaign, the BJPs 83-year-old patriarch was supposed to address a joint rally with its chief ministerial candidate Kalyan Singh and Apna Dal chief Sone Lal Patel. But it was cancelled.

 After staying away from the first four rounds of polling, Vajpayee showed up for campaigning in Lucknow only last Wednesday.

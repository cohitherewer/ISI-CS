 Shot at Dalit Muslim SC status

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: The Centre may explore the possibility of reclassifying Dalit Muslims as scheduled castes, a category from which they were ejected in 1950.

 A 13-member committee, set up by the human resource development ministry to suggest ways of implementing the Sachar committee recommendations, has said Dalit Muslims -- the most backward among the community should be granted the benefit of affirmative action.

 Article 341 of the Constitution allows the President to notify a group as a Scheduled Caste, a category that now includes the most backward sections of Hindus, neo-Buddhists and Sikhs. A Scheduled Caste convert to Christianity or Islam loses the status and the benefit of reservation.

 The Sachar report has shown that Dalit Muslims are more backward educationally than the Scheduled Castes, vindicating those who want reservation for them.

 Granting Scheduled Caste status to Dalit Muslims, however, will require an amendment to the Constitution, which was changed once before to let in the neo-Buddhists and Sikhs.

 Earlier, there had been a suggestion to split the Other Backward Classes into two groups -- other backward castes and most backward castes and include the Dalit Muslims among the second group. This had faced opposition from OBC parties unwilling to share the backward reservation pie.

 Junior HRD minister M.A.A. Fatmi will tomorrow hand in a final report on the 13-member panels recommendations to his senior, Arjun Singh. The ministry is expected to ask the social justice ministry to see if Dalit Muslims can be brought in the Scheduled Caste category. 

 The issue is sensitive because most political parties have so far stood against religion-based reservations. The CPM, however, has called for affirmative action for Muslims following the publication of the Sachar report.

 But no political party, not even the BJP, can afford to openly rubbish the idea of reservation for Dalit Muslims, who form a large enough vote bank. The ruling Congress will be especially warm to the idea on the eve of the Uttar Pradesh polls.

 Muslim MPs and NGOs also want the Centre to set up only-Muslim schools in areas dominated by the community to increase the enrolment of Muslim children, particularly girls.

 They have told Arjun that few Muslim children can go to schools like the Kendriya Vidyalayas and Navodaya Vidyalayas.

 The Sachar report has expressed grave concern at the educational status of Muslims. Muslim children often spend fewer years in school compared with Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe children.

 Analysis of time trends indicate that despite overall improvement in educational status, the rate of progress has been the slowest for Muslims. In other words, while the educational attainments of Muslims have improved over the years, it has done so at a more gradual pace than other socio-religious communities, the Sachar report said.

 Poll pits another mother against son

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Jaya Prada campaigns in Rampur

 Rampur, April 16: A mother-son battle reminiscent of Madhavrao Scindias famous feud with Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia is being played out on a royal turf in Uttar Pradesh.

 The Congresss Noor Bano, the widow of Nawab Zulfiquar Ali Khan, is having to live down the challenge from her son, Nawab Quazim Ali, who walked out of her mothers party to shake hands with Mulayam Singh Yadav.

 Quazim is the Samajwadi Party candidate from neighbouring Swar Tanda, where Noor Bano is backing the Congresss Afroz Ali. What has made matters worse for the mother and son are the barbs flung by parliamentary affairs minister Azam Khan.

 As the candidate from Rampur city, Khan is mixing a high dose of anti-palace sentiments with development chants. The palace is long gone. How can you call a three-room flat a palace? People are rising in revolt against it, including a son (Quazim), says Khan, who kicked up a row with his plan for an Urdu university in Rampur of which he would be pro-chancellor for life.

 The anti-palace tirade leaves Quazim uneasy, but he can do little to rein in Khan. Both dont see eye to eye on most issues and Mulayam is their only bridge. But, Quazim is in no mood to return to his mother or the Congress. 

 Noor Bano has not given up hope, though. He will understand his mistakes, stop drifting and come back one day, she says, adding the attempt by some Samajwadi Party leaders to malign the royal family is obnoxious. 

 Caught in the crossfire is Jaya Prada, the Rampur MP who defeated Noor Bano in the 2004 polls. In a delicate balancing act, she keeps a distance from Khan and campaigns for all Samajwadi Party candidates, including Quazim. I dont look at personal issues. I campaign for a party which stands by the poor, she says.

 Quazim entered politics with his mother in 1999 and won on a Congress ticket from Rampur in 2002. In 2003, when Mulayam formed the government, he changed sides. This is his first election without his mothers help. 

 The State of Rampur, as it was called during the British rule, was a Congress fortress since its merger into the country. Today, the palace facades are crumbling, the giant gates rusted and the walls wear a haunted look. However, the Reza Library, which attracts scholars from the world over, stands out amid the decrepit structures.

 But Khan believes there has been a lot of progress. The development of Rampur is for everyone to see. The government has done a lot for the area in a short span of time. What did Begum (Noor) do when as an MP? he asks.

 The key to success in Rampur lies with Muslims, who make up 60 per cent of the voters. Most of the peasants are Pathans, known to be anti-palace and supporters of Khan.

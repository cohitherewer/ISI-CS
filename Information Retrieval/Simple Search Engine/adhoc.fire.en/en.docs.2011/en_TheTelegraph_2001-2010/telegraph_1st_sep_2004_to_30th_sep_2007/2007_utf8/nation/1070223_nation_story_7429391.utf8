 More relief for urban displaced

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 22: Those displaced by development projects in Bengals municipal areas can hope to get alternative housing as well as livelihood.

 The state government is working on a new rehabilitation policy relating to all road, township and other development projects in the Calcutta metropolitan area as well as in the Siliguri, Haldia, Asansol, Durgapur and Burdwan municipal areas.

 Well arrange for stalls, shops or kiosks for the poor, displaced farmers, said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, who has been asked by the chief minister to draft the overall policy within a few days.

 The state now lacks a comprehensive rehab policy for landlosers. The Land Acquisition Act provides for the displaced to be paid 130 per cent of the plots market value, but there isnt much else.

 The government does have a bare minimum package for below-poverty-level families, but it only seeks to provide a two-cottah plot or a ready house. 

 But the land protests have forced the government to realise the need to also provide alternative means of livelihood.

 On Monday, the government had unveiled a new package for those to be displaced by the Dankuni township, promising to build houses or acquire alternative land.

 It also promised the families it would sponsor the school education of all their children as well as Industrial Training Institute training for one member.

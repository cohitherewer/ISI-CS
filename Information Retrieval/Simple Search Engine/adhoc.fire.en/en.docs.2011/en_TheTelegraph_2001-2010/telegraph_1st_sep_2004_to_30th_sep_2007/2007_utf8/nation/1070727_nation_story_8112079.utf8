 SC quota hearing

 New Delhi, July 26 (PTI): A five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court will from August 7 begin hearing petitions on the validity of the law providing reservation to Other Backward Classes in higher education.

 The court, however, added that it would hear the Centres application seeking vacation of the interim stay on implementing the legislation on July 31, as scheduled.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan did not accept the plea to defer the July 31 hearing after petitioners supporting the Centres request pointed out that an academic year was involved.

 Putting a halt to the implementation of the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006, a two-judge bench had referred the matter to the Chief Justice for allocating it before a larger bench.

 The court was told that before the matter was referred to the Chief Justice, 30 questions had been framed for consideration by a larger bench. Lawyers suggested that the Constitution bench reframe them before formally starting the hearing.

 The court agreed and said it would look into the major questions and then begin the hearing.

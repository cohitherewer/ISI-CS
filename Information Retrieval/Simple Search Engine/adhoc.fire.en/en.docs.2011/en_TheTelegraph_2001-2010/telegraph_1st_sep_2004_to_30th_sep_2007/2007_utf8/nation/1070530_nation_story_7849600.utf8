 Jaitley handed UP crown of thorns

 Jaitley: Ready for challenge

 New Delhi, May 29: The BJP has picked Arun Jaitley to revive its fortunes in Uttar Pradesh, an appointment with which party chief Rajnath Singh hopes to kill two birds.

 Unwrapping a series of changes the first significant allocation of work in the BJP in three years Rajnath put Jaitleys skills to test in a state where the party is down in the dumps. The BJPs Assembly tally in Uttar Pradesh is now languishing at 51, the lowest since 1984.

 Under attack for the poor show in the Assembly polls, Rajnath has launched a counter-attack by packing off his biggest political opponent to prove his mettle in the heartland.

 Sources said Rajnath has scuttled Jaitleys attempts to be installed as general secretary in charge of Himachal Pradesh and Delhi, where he expected to continue the dream run that started from victories in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and, more recently, in Punjab. 

 Jaitley was in charge of all these states. The BJP expects to sweep both Himachal and Delhi that are going to polls early next year. 

 Jaitley, however, showed no signs of having been thwarted. Appearing cheerful, he declared that he was more than ready to take on the challenge.

 Unquestionably, it is a difficult task. But because it is difficult, it is also challenging. The party has recently received a setback in Uttar Pradesh. But I think we have a large base in the state. We also have the added advantage of a galaxy of senior leaders Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalyan Singh and Rajnath Singh from the state whose counsel would be invaluable, Jaitley said. 

 Asked whether he has sufficient time to tone up the party before the Lok Sabha polls in 2009, Jaitley said: More than adequate. Let us not forget that we had 58 Lok Sabha seats in the state not so long ago and still have a very good party infrastructure. I take it as a challenge.

 Jaitley said he would require a deputy to handle Uttar Pradesh affairs. I am going to visit the state soon. I was planning to go abroad early next month but let me see if I can make a quick visit before that.

 The organisational shake-up leaves Maharashtra stalwart Gopinath Munde in charge of Rajasthan. Munde is Pramod Mahajans successor in the BJP.

 Mahajan was the architect of the BJPs victory in Rajasthan and was considered to be on good terms with chief minister Vasundhara Raje, now under fire not only for poor administration but also for a penchant for courting controversy. Mundes appointment is seen as the central leaderships attempt to iron out the wrinkles. 

 The partys deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, Vijay Kumar Malhotra, is replaced in Delhi by general secretary Thawar Chand Gehlot. But Malhotra is happy because the shift rekindles his hopes of being projected as BJPs chief ministerial candidate in Delhi early next year. 

 Former external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha has been handed Karnatakas political affairs. In Andhra Pradesh, the party has chosen spokesperson Prakash Javdekar in a move to downsize former party president M. Venkaiah Naidu who largely holds forth on affairs concerning the southern states. 

 Senior spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad has got independent charge of Tamil Nadu.

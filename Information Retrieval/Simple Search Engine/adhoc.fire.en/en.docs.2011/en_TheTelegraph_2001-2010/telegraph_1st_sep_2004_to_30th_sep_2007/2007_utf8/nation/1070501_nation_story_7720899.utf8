 Give some amp; take some to beat nuke chill in air

 New Delhi, April 30: India and the US will be trying to broker a compromise over the 123 nuclear agreement during talks between foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon and counterpart Nicholas Burns.

 With both sides aware that the nuclear negotiations are being closely followed not only at home but also in the rest of the world, it seems New Delhi might be prepared to accept the US principle that if it carries out a nuclear test, it will have to suffer the consequences.

 Far from the theories that have recently been bandied about over the demise of the bilateral nuclear agreement, New Delhi seems pretty gung-ho about the success of the talks over the next few rounds.

 Sources here argued that in keeping with Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs commitment to Parliament, India will not barter away any rights to the US. 

 On the other hand, the Indian negotiating team will have to be realistic and search for a compromise with the Americans, just as Burns, the US under-secretary of state, seemed to be doing in his Washington Post article two days ago.

 According to US law, any country other than the Permanent Five is barred from carrying out a nuclear test. If it does, it must face serious consequences.

 This includes not only a complete stop to nuclear cooperation between the US and the offending country (in this case, India), but also America taking back all the equipment, material and technology it has given to this country so far, a principle known as the right of return.

 Although India, after the Pokhran tests of 1998, has imposed a voluntary moratorium on testing, it has never been willing to bind itself internationally on this issue.

 Indian scientists, especially from the Department of Atomic Energy, have argued that India, which has painfully built its nuclear programme over the decades in the face of international (read, American) hostility, cannot now be subject to US rules and conditions.

 The fact, however, is that such a US law (the right of return) exists and the Bush administration, considerably weakened by the Iraq fiasco, is in no mood to amend it only for India. Under the circumstances, it seems as though India will have to come round to accepting the principle.

 In exchange, the US will be persuaded to change the language of implementation of this principle, sources said. 

 This means that even if India violates US law and conducts a test, the wording on the manner and quality of the implementation of the right of return law will be left so deliberately vague that India may not have to return the nuclear supplies that it has got from the US so far.

 The second sticking point between India and the US revolves around the right to reprocess nuclear material that is produced by a nuclear reactor, the spent fuel which is good enough to make nuclear bombs. 

 Once again, all countries, except the Permanent Five, are enjoined to return this spent fuel to the country with whom they have a nuclear agreement, although the US has made exceptions considerably complicated ones for Japan and the Euratom Agency.

 However, unlike the right of return principle that is part of US law, the reprocessing condition is not mandated by American law.

 The Menon team now hopes not only to get an exception for India, just like Japan and the Euratom, but will argue that the very small amounts of spent nuclear fuel that is produced in the Indian situation is hardly something that Washington need get nervous about.

 Of course, the language of this particular clause will look into the ratio of spent fuel and the reprocessing quantity. Perhaps, New Delhi could give guarantees that the spent fuel will not be used in the military nuclear reactors that are out of US purview in the first place.

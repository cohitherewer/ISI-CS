 JU frowns on tech entry list

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 9: Jadavpur University today questioned the method adopted by the joint entrance examination (JEE) board for preparing this years merit list for engineering and expressed reluctance to admit students on its basis.

 The university also urged the state higher education department to probe allegations by students and teachers that the list was faulty.

 The charges against the state joint entrance board are serious. We will draw the attention of the higher education minister and wait for a response, said university registrar Rajat Banerjee.

 The issue was discussed at a meeting of the universitys executive council today, where the members unanimously decided to urge the government to set up a separate JEE board to ensure more transparency. At present, the board is part of Bengal Engineering and Science University.

 A section of the students and teachers had objected to doubling the marks scored in mathematics to give more weight to the subject.

 JEE board member secretary Asim Bose said more weight was given to math as it formed the most important part of engineering education. We have discussed the matter with the higher education department. The government has not given any instruction to revise the merit list.

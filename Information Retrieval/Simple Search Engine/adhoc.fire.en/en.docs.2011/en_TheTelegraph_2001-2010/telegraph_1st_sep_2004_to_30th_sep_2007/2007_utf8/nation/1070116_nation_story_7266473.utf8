The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Boss in, BJP out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 15: Truant BJP office-bearers were gently shaken out of their slumber by party president Rajnath Singh this morning.

 The BJP central office at 11, Ashoka Road is normally deserted till late afternoon, with few leaders and office-bearers bothering to turn up for work on a day-to-day basis.

 Rajnath, on the contrary, follows a regimented routine. He is the only BJP president who comes to the party office religiously when he is in Delhi. Having been a teacher for a long time, he is a stickler for discipline.

 Rajnath arrived at 11, Ashoka Road around 10.30 this morning. Instead of hurrying to his own chambers like he usually does, the BJP boss decided to check out whether he had anyone for company. 

 He walked across to the BJP Yuva Morcha offices first. No one neither Morcha president Dharmendra Pradhan nor any office manager was there. After that, Rajnath marched into the Minority Morcha. A similar sight awaited him there dark, empty offices and shuttered blinds, with Morcha president Tanvir Haidar Osmani nowhere to be found.

 The media cell was empty, too, except for a computer operator and the office manager, Shambhu. I had gone to collect a file, said Shambhu, but hurried back when I heard adhyakshji (party president) had come to our office.

 After doing the rounds of a couple of other offices, Rajnath went back to his own.

 The idea was to send a message. People should take their work more seriously than they are currently doing, said a BJP source.

 The party president lingered on the media cell longer than other offices because he is reportedly annoyed with the work culture there.

 During the BJPs national council and executive meeting in Lucknow, the cell was supposed to arrange for journalists train bookings and accommodation. But neither had been made. Rajnath was livid when the matter was reported to him, especially because the people given the task had flown to Lucknow instead of travelling with the media contingent.

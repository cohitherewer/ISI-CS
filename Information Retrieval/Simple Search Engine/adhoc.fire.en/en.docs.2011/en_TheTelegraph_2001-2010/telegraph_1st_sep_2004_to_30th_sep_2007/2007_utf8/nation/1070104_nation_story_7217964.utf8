 Information blow to officer

 New Delhi, Jan. 3 (PTI): Information relating to an ongoing departmental inquiry against a government official cannot be disclosed under the Right to Information Act, the Central Information Commission has held.

 Any disciplinary process, till such time a chargesheet is issued or the case is closed, has to be treated as a matter under inquiry/investigation..... said information commissioner Padma Balasubramanian in a recent order.

 Sarvesh Kaushal, an IAS official in the Food Corporation of India, filed a petition for disclosure of certain information specific to an ongoing inquiry on misappropriation of crops against him.

 Rejecting his contention that information relating to departmental inquiries were entitled for disclosure under the act, the commission said such proceedings formed part of investigation and, thereby, were excluded from disclosure under the act.

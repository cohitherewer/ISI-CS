 Delhi wrestles with J amp;K troop cut

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, March 28: Mufti Mohammed Sayeeds sustained demand for pullout of troops from Jammu and Kashmir was the subject of discussion as the governments core committee met this evening at Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs residence.

 The meeting, attended by senior ministers Pranab Mukherjee, A.K. Antony and Shivraj Patil, was expected to deliberate on the political implications of the issue and whether it was tenable for the government to go some way on acceding Sayeeds demand.

 Whatever decision is taken will be political. Everything else, the logistics, the phases in which the troop pullout will take place, if at all, will follow from this, said a high-level Congress source.

 Through the last week, following the meetings Mufti had with the Prime Minister and Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the government has been counting the cost of withdrawing the troops. Sources said the factors considered were the enormous price that may have to be paid if the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) demand was not met and the Congresss political losses in the Jammu region and elsewhere.

 Destabilising a political alliance in J amp;K is not the same as doing it in, say, Karnataka. The implications extend beyond the borders to Pakistan, said a source. 

 The government has factored in the chances of Muftis PDP moving closer, and making common cause, with the Hurriyat, in case the alliance with the Congress snaps on the issue of troop pullout.

 Its not as if J amp;K would plunge into a mid-term election because there are reports that the PDP may split if Mufti pulls out support and a faction might want to continue to be a part of the alliance government. The Congress could also count on the National Conference to bail it out in the Assembly. But thats not the point. The worry is instability of any kind would embolden the hardliners and thats a risk not worth taking, said a source.

 On the flip side, chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, who insists on a consensus in the Jammu and Kashmir political establishment before taking a decision, will have to contend with an aggressive campaign from the BJP, which is a force in Jammu, the region he belongs to.

 For the past three days, the BJP has been accusing the government of reducing and relocating troops from the hills of the Jammu region.

 The timing of reduction of troops from this sensitive area is more serious as infiltration increases in summer, party spokesperson Prakash Javadekar told reporters today. He called for an unambiguous explanation from the Prime Minister on the discussions he had with Mufti. The people have a right to know the truth and the government has to ensure that political expediency will not lead to a dilution of critical security considerations, Javadekar said.

 Although there was no official response to the allegation from either the Prime Ministers Office or the Congress, party sources admitted that the row could help the BJP regroup its Hindu constituency in Jammu and Uttar Pradesh, which goes to polls shortly.

 There was also no official comment from the defence establishment to the BJPs statement. Defence ministry sources said a response should be sought from a higher level because the BJP has embroiled the Prime Minister in the matter.

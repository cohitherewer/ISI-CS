 Togadia jab

 New Delhi, July 24: VHP leader Praveen Togadia took a swipe at the BJP today, saying his outfit congratulates Pratibha Patil for being elected President. 

 Togadia said the VHP hopes Pratibha would live up to the tradition of the Rajputs and the Marathas and orders the death penalty for Mohammed Afzal Guru (in the Parliament attack case).

 He also slammed the BJPs choice of Najma Heptullah as vice-presidential candidate. All alliances have given importance to religion than merit in deciding their candidates for the poll.

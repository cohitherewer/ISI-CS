 40% Indian kids missing from birth log

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 New Delhi, Jan. 16: Forty per cent of children in India are missing from official records at least till they turn 18. 

 In spite of a law passed more than four decades ago making birth registration mandatory, 38 per cent of the births in 2004 went unreported, the registrar-generals office in Delhi said. 

 Approximately 26 million children are born every year, out of whom 10 million dont exist on the records and could go missing without a trace.

 They have no identity till they are 18 years of age when they can apply for a voters identity card, says Razia Ismail, convener of the India Alliance for Child Rights (IACR). 

 Backed by the Centre, a network of voluntary organisations has been campaigning all over India to push for registration of births, and is trying to rope in the National Knowledge Commission and the Planning Commission. 

 The demand for the right of every child to an identity may soon find space in the portal the Knowledge Commission is planning on citizens rights. An effort is on to get the Planning Commission to take note of the birth registration campaign in the 11th Five Year Plan.

 Three lakh registration units exist in the country. The government claims that India has the best data collection unit. But the registration figures remain abysmally low, Ismail says. 

 The calculation of unregistered births is based on the number of births officially recorded and an estimate of anticipated births every year.

 Recently, the government passed a law making registration of marriages compulsory. But the birth registration law passed in 1969 does not have a provision for penalty if it is not complied with. 

 Ismail points out that birth registration is essentially about the rights of children something India is committed to. 

 Last year, the human resource development ministry brought out a national action plan for children, but it still remains on paper. Among the 12 key areas listed in the action plan is the aim to achieve 100 per cent civil registration of births. 

 Children are ignored by policymakers. There is neither the political will nor the required focus, Ismail says. Till they are 18, when they can vote, these children do not exist for the state. They have no proof of identity.

 The campaign for birth registration has so far met with marginal success. The IACR is working with Delhis unregistered children. One of the main hurdles is red tapism and the refusal to make the process easy for children who live on the streets and do not have the resources to go to the magistrate and police.

 If you have not been registered at birth, you can still do it later but at a cost that few children without a shelter can afford.

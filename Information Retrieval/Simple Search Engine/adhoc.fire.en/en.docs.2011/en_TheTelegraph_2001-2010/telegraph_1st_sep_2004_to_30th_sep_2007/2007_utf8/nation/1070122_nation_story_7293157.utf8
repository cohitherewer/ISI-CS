 Patriot Munshi booms, but blackout stays

 New Delhi, Jan. 21: Indira Gandhi invoked the foreign hand. The BJP found the ISI a convenient bogey. Priya Ranjan Das Munshi plays the patriotic card.

 Today, Nimbus got a taste of the information and broadcasting ministers patriotism when the Mumbai company stood accused of going against national interests by refusing to share telecast rights of the first India-West Indies one-day match. 

 Nimbus holds the broadcast rights to all BCCI-organised events played in the country till 2010. It paid $612 million for the deal last year.

 I am sorry to say, but this is the most unpatriotic attitude of the company (Nimbus). We cant allow them to plunder in India and take away all the money. We will ensure that people of India arent deprived, Das Munshi thundered as 55 million homes missed the Nagpur humdinger as it unfolded this afternoon. The action wasnt available on radio, either.

 The minister was quick to promise a law, saying he would get the cabinet to discuss it as early as this week. The matter is almost ready. I am reporting it to the cabinet this week.

 Nimbus today said it is ready to provide the signals, but the company wants Doordarshan (DD) to ensure that the feed is encrypted so that it is available only on DDs terrestrial service the television that viewers get to see through rooftop antennas. The firm says encryption could be done in two to three weeks, but Prasar Bharati hadnt accepted the proposal till late tonight.

 The legal option is open. Tomorrow, Nimbus and the cricket board could go to the Supreme Court. We tried to settle the matter with DD but it rejected sharing revenue on a 75-25 per cent basis. The petition can be filed tomorrow, BCCI vice-president Shashank Manohar said in Nagpur.

 The four-match series, which ends on January 31, is being shown on Nimbus Neo Sports.

 The governments uplink guidelines say private channels must share live feed of all matches of national interest with Doordarshan, but Nimbus chief Harish Thawani has been insisting these norms arent binding. 

 Sources said it might not be easy for Das Munshi to win the cabinets endorsement on the sports broadcasting signals bill. Senior ministers, including Sharad Pawar, are reportedly in favour of a transparent system for sharing of sports signals with DD. 

 Pawar, also the BCCI boss, is against forcing private sports channels to share signals with DD if they feel the terms arent in their interest. 

 I dont understand why the minister (Das Munshi) is so livid. Doordarshan uses unencrypted signals, which can be caught in India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, West Asia, Malaysia and Singapore. We have licensees in these countries. If the match is telecast on DD (other than its terrestrial service), unlicensed broadcasters and cable operators can telecast it, too. This will create a huge piracy issue, Nimbus vice-president (marketing) Yannick Colaco said tonight. 

 This isnt Das Munshis first attempt at playing broadcast nanny. Hes asked film-makers to stub out smoking scenes, only to retract later that he couldnt imagine Churchill without a cigar and Devdas without the bottle. 

 He had Rang de Basanti referred to the defence ministry, and got religious leaders to vet the Da Vinci Code. 

 The broadcast bill which imposed stiff cross-media restrictions and almost shut out sting operations was taken off the cabinet table after objections from the media. That piece of legislation was among his pet subjects.

 Haneef

 Melbourne, July 24: Mohammed Haneef today burst into tears when a relative showed him pictures of his newborn daughter he was apparently rushing home to see when he was arrested on July 2.

 Imran Siddiqui, a cousin of Haneefs wife Firdous, showed him the photos at the Wolston Correctional Centre, near Brisbane, where the Bangalore doctor has been kept since his visa was cancelled.

 In the half-hour visit, Haneef was reduced to tears several times as he looked at the pictures of his daughter, born on June 27. I think they were tears of joy, Siddiqui said.

 Haneef told investigators he was trying to fly home to see his daughter, who was suffering from jaundice, when he was arrested in connection with the failed UK terror plots. Obviously, he was very proud. He had the look of a doting dad, Haneefs lawyer Peter Russo said. 

 Siddiqui tried to comfort the 27-year-old doctor, charged with recklessly providing support to a terrorist organisation.

 I did not tell him that we believe hes innocent. I told him we all know that hes innocent, he said.

 Siddiqui asserted that there is no case against Haneef, and described his brother-in-law as a responsible son who lost his father very early. Hes just trying to understand why this is happening to him. In Bangalore, Firdous said she has been told that her husband was mentally strong to cope with the crisis. Imran (Siddiqui) told me not to worry. He also informed me that Haneef was in good health, she said.

 A Brisbane magistrate granted Haneef bail but he remains behind bars because of immigration minister Kevin Andrewss decision to cancel his temporary skills visa. The terror charges will be heard on August 31.

 Today, as he watched television and went through newspapers for the first time in three weeks, Haneef was said to be baffled by the protests against his arrest, Russo said.

 Indian mission help

 The Indian high commission in Australia is assisting Haneefs family in the legal battle to help him get back his visa. In a statement, the commission said India has conveyed its concern to Canberra about the need for Haneef to be treated fairly.

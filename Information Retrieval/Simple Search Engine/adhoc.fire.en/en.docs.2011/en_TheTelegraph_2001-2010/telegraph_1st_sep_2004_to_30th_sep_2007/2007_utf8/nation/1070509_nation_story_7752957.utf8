 BSP edge with a mystery

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, May 8: Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party was projected to emerge as the single-largest party in Uttar Pradesh after the seven-phase elections drew to a close today.

 From the first leg of polling to the last, the BSP has retained this position. The question, however, was how close the BSP would get to the halfway mark of 202.

 According to exit poll figures put out by four TV news channels STAR News, Times Now, CNN-IBN and NDTV 24x7 the BSP would bag anything between 121 and 168 seats.

 The Samajwadi Party, believed to be on the decline, seemed to have staged a recovery. 

 But the verdict was still out on whether it would emerge second or be pushed to third position by the BJP.

 STAR News and Times Now put Mulayam Singh Yadavs party in third place with 96 and 105 seats while CNN-IBN and NDTV positioned it as a close or a remote second.

 CNN-IBN gave the Samajwadi Party between 99 and 111 seats over 50 seats less than the BSP while NDTV said it would be pipped by a whisker (four seats).

 According to Times Now, the difference between the BSP and the BJP was only two seats. 

 STAR News said the BJP would be far behind. CNN-IBN and NDTV put it at number three.

 There was no change in the Congresss standing at number four. The figures, however, varied from a low of 27 (STAR News) to a high of 45 (NDTV).

 The other parties which included a gamut of secular and caste-based parties were given anything between 10 and 34 seats.

 Significant in this cate-gory was Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Janata Dal. It could not strike an alliance with any of the main players but Ajit reportedly believes he could be a kingmaker in a fractured scenario.

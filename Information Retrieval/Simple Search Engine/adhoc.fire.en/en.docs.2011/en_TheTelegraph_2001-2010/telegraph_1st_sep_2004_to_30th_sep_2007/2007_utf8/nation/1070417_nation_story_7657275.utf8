 Woo deity, but from afar

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, April 16: Want to get up close to the Lord through special yagnas? Sorry, access denied.

 Lord Murugans temporal guardians have decided you must keep your distance whoever you are.

 Authorities of the Sri Subramanyaswami temple in Tiruchendur, one of the six abodes of the deity in Tamil Nadu, have banned special yagnas or yagams (Vedic sacrifices) by VIPs in the first enclosure near the sanctum sanctorum.

 Reason: such offerings were increasingly becoming a private ritual de-linked from the temples administration, minister for Hindu religious and charitable endowments K.R. Periyakaruppan said today. 

 Moreover, he added, the thick smoke and the heat generated from such rituals in the first enclosure tended to damage the ceiling and posed a danger to the structure.

 The seaside shrine that draws thousands of devotees every year has for long allowed yagnas in the outer precincts of the temple. But in recent years, yagams, mainly for VIPs and well-to-do families, began to be performed in the first enclosure for a small fee collected by the priests themselves.

 Among the high and the mighty who visited the temple recently for special prayers were former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and his son, Karnataka chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy.

 Periyakaruppan defended the ban when an Opposition member, Anitha Radhakrishnan, raised the issue in the Assembly. 

 The ADMK leader said the sudden move had hurt the sentiments of pilgrims, who have also been hit by the steep hike in entrance fee from Rs 10 to Rs 100 for special darshan.

 The minister replied that the ban had been imposed mainly to protect the temples structure.

 The move, Periyakaruppan said, has also ensured more space for pilgrims to freely move around, not possible earlier because of the special prayers inside the temple.

 Local residents of Tiruchendur and devotees in general have welcomed the ban. Only the Vedic or Tantric priests at the temple were objecting to the move, Periyakaruppan said.

 He also made it clear that the state government had nothing to do with the decision and people were free to perform yagnas in places earmarked outside the temple.

 The temple administration was also ready to build a separate Yagasala Mandapam solely for such rituals, the minister added.

 Periyakaruppan said representatives of the temples priests had complained to him about the decision and he has asked the Hindu religious and charitable endowments commissioner to study the issue and submit a report to the government. Till then, the ban will continue, though the increased entrance fee for special darshan has been put on hold.

 Techie suicide blamed on job

 OUR BUREAU

 May 7: The family of Arpan Das, an analyst with Citigroup Global Services in Mumbai, believes that job dissatisfaction drove him to death.

 The 25-year-old IIT Kanpur graduate from Suri in Birbhum was found hanging from a ceiling fan at his rented apartment in Goregaon yesterday afternoon. He had moved to Mumbai from Bangalore only a month ago.

 A few hours before his death around 11 in the morning Arpan had called up his mother, a math teacher at Tantipara Girls High School in Suri, and said he was unhappy with his job.

 Arpan said he was not liking the job at all and was confused. He said he was not getting to do the work for which he had been recruited and this left him clueless about his job profile, his maternal uncle Nikhilesh Das said from Suri. He had voiced his dissatisfaction to one of his cousins after talking to his mother.

 Nikhilesh added that his nephew was also lonely. Arpan said he was not quite as comfortable with his roommates in Mumbai as he was with those in Bangalore and used to feel very lonely at times. It now appears that he suffered from a serious bout of depression.

 Police in Mumbai, however, said the reason for Arpans suicide is not known yet. He was an introvert and that was making investigations difficult, they added.

 He was a very quiet person. He shared the flat with two others, but they didnt have a clue what was going on with him, said Shivaji Bodake, the deputy commissioner of police, Zone XII. 

 Roommates Saumen Bachchar and Kunal Sharma told the police they had no idea if Das was depressed. When Arpan killed himself, Bachchar was out visiting a friend and Sharma had gone to the airport to drop his mother who had come from Delhi.

 Sharma returned home around 1.30 in the afternoon and found the door locked. When repeated knocks and calls to Arpans cellphone failed to yield a response, he called the watchman. The door was finally opened at 3 pm with a duplicate key, and the two found Arpan hanging from the fan.

 The door was bolted from inside. We found no suicide note and till now we have no leads. We are hoping his parents can throw some light on his state of mind, said Bodake. 

 Arpans mother, brother and a friend will leave for Mumbai tomorrow to bring back his body, which has been kept at Bhagwati Hospital in Borivli. 

 The elder of two brothers, Arpan passed Madhyamik from Birbhum Zilla School in Suri with 91 per cent marks. After his higher secondary exam, he gained admission in Presidency College but dropped out because of ill health. The next year, he joined Ramakrishna Residential College in Narendrapur for graduation in statistics. He did his masters at IIT Kanpur.

 New Delhi, April 18: The chief of US naval operations and the advocate of a Thousand-Ship Navy, Admiral Michael G. Mullen, today explained his concept of the dream maritime force to an approving Indian Navy and sought access to Indian ports for warships of such a fleet.

 Admiral Mullen is widely credited with the idea of the thousand-ship navy (TSN in short) a catch-all phrase that denotes a cooperative of navies to police the oceans. He was asked to explain the concept by senior Indian navy officers and defence experts during a round table discussion hosted by the Indian Navy here today.

 Asked who he thought would be the fleet forces commander in a thousand-ship navy, Admiral Mullen said: There is no commander. There are no entry rules. Nobody can do this alone. The leadership is with all of us. He said the thousand ships would not make for a US-led navy.

 Admiral Mullen said after his discussions that the Indian response to his idea was very positive. The aspiration for a TSN is a multilateral effort outside the UN that will see navies from across the world sharing information on movement of terrorist suspects, strategic complexities and even operating jointly. Admiral Mullen said a trilateral naval exercise that concluded yesterday between Indian, US and Japanese warships was a step in that direction.

 Admiral Mullen met the chief of the Indian Navy, Admiral Sureesh Mehta, and senior officials of the defence ministry this morning. The US admiral is understood to have touched upon a Pentagon request for basing and access of American warships in Indian ports as a matter of routine. 

 Currently such permissions are given case by case. But last month, with discrete Indian approval, the US signed an Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement with Sri Lanka that will permit the US Navy to dock its warships in Lankan ports, a development that some years back would have elicited disapproval from New Delhi.

 Prima facie, the concept (of the thousand-ship navy) is in keeping with the ideas of the Indian Navy, said navy spokesman Captain Vinay Garg. We have been advocating that cooperative arrangements are required in the seas and have been advocating increased maritime domain awareness.

 Admiral Mullen is expected to be given a tour of naval facilities in Mumbai tomorrow. His visit comes a week after meetings in New Delhi between Indian defence officials and the US under-secretary of defence for Asia and the Pacific.

 India-US naval ties lead the military-to-military relations between the two countries since Indian naval ships escorted an American fleet in the 2001 war in Afghanistan and the replenishment of vessels during the 2003 war on Iraq. By May 26 this year the navy-to-navy relations will get another fillip. The Indian Navy expects to commission its first warship acquired from the US on that date. The erstwhile American landing platform dock, the USS Trenton (rechristened Jalashva) is to be inducted into the Indian fleet.

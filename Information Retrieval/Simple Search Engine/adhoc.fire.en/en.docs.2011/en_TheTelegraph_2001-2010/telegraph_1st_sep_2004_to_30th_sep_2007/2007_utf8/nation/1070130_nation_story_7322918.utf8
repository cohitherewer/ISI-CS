 Srinagar, Jan. 29: Her face buried in her mothers chest, three-month-old Insha is unmindful of the tragedy that has befallen her family.

 Their sole breadwinner and Inshas father Abdul Rahman Padder has been killed and her mother Muneera Akhtar has come miles to the city from a south Kashmir village in search of his body.

 Padder is believed to have been killed by police during a fake shootout on Srinagars outskirts. Branded a Pakistani militant, the catch had fetched the police Rs 1.2 lakh as reward.

 Smelling foul play, the Jammu and Kashmir government has ordered an investigation, arrested two cops and attached senior superintendent of police H.R. Parihar and his deputy Bahadur Ram to prevent tampering of the evidence.

 When the issue rocked the Assembly today, chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad used strong words and promised action.

 Any security force person found guilty of killing any innocent for personal reasons, rewards or appeasement will not be spared. Nobody is above law, he told the House.

 We stand by zero tolerance to human rights abuses. Our rock-solid support to security forces does not mean that we will keep our eyes closed to their wrong actions. That should be clear to them.

 But the family is not consoled.

 Who will take care of my four daughters, my son and our aged father? cried Padders widow Akhtar. He was our sole bread earner.

 Padder was a carpenter from Larnoo village in Anantnag and had come to the city to earn a livelihood. 

 He went missing last month, forcing his family to lodge a missing report with the police.

 But for his mobile set, his death would have never come to light. Police tracked his set, with the help of BSNL authorities, and found it in possession of Abdul Rasheed Wagay of Sonawari.

 Wagay told the police that he got it from assistant sub-inspector Farooq Gudoo, who works with the counter-insurgency Special Operations Group of the police at Ganderbal.

 Gudoo and Farooq Ahmad, a police constable, were subsequently arrested and during investigations revealed that they had snatched Padders mobile after his death.

 We have started the investigations and it will take us some time to reach the bottom of the case, said Kashmir DIG Farooq Ahmad, who is heading the investigation.

 Police sources said Padder was taken to Waskar in Ganderbal after he was arrested from Srinagars Batamaloo locality and killed in a fake encounter.

 The police then lodged an FIR at the adjoining Shadipora police station claiming they had killed a Pakistani militant. They also claimed to have recovered an assault rifle and some ammunition.

 This fetched them Rs 1.2 lakh as reward, an official said.

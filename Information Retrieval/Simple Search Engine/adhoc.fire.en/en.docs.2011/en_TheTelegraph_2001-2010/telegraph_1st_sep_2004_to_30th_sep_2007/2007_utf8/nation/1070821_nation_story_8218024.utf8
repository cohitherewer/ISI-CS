 Lucknow, Aug. 20: Descendants of a British hero who fought and died during the Indian Mutiny will retrace his steps but as mutiny tourists.

 One hundred and fifty years after the uprising, they will visit Lucknow to connect with events that unfolded in what many historians see as Indias first war of independence.

 Among the visitors will be Sir Anthony M. Havelock Allen, a descendant of Major General Henry Havelock, who is remembered for recapturing Cawnpore (Kanpur) from the rebels in July 1857.

 The mutiny tourism is being promoted by leading tour operators like Palanquin Travels in London and its agent in India, Tornos.

 Tornos special representative for the programme Ajay Jain said the 20 mutiny tourists would be in India from the second week of September and reach Lucknow on September 24.

 The group would be guided by Rosie Llewellyn-Jones, a London-based architectural historian, and Saul David, also a historian, Jain added.

 The idea is to visit the places connected to events during 1857 and 1858 and to search out the memorials related to these events, Llewellyn-Jones said in an email to the tour organisers here.

 David the author of The Indian Mutiny (shortlisted for the Westminster medal for military literature) had visited Lucknow in February-March this year.

 The group is expected to hold a short religious service on the premises of the Lucknow Residency on September 25, the day relief reached the building, the heart of the British defence, for the first time.

 British inhabitants of Lucknow had taken shelter in the residency and the commander, Sir Henry Lawrence, was expected to be able to hold out for as long as 15 days before relief could arrive. It was 87 days later when a small force under Havelock broke through the besiegers to relieve the half-starved defenders.

 But the rebels laid fresh siege, which continued up to November 17 when Sir Colin Campbell finally broke through.

 The shattered walls still bear the tell-tale marks of cannon shots and the cemetery at the nearby ruined church accommodates the graves of 2,000 men, women and children, including that of Sir Henry Lawrence who died during the first siege, a spokesman for the Archaeological Survey of India said.

 Havelock, chosen to command a column to quell disturbances in Allahabad and to support Sir Henry Lawrence in Lucknow and General Hugh Wheeler in Cawnpore, led his soldiers across Oudh, defeating all the rebel forces in his path despite being outnumbered. But he died in Lucknow on November 24 of dysentery.

 His relatives want to visit all these places before reaching Calcutta, from where they would visit Barrackpore, the scene of sepoy Mangal Pandeys rebellion.

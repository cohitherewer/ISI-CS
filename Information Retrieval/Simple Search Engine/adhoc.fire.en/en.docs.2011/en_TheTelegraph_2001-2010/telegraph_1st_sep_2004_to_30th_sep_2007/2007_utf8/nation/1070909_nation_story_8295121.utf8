The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Colour, humour in solo show

 AMIT ROY 

 London, Sept. 8: Manish Arora has followed Christian Lacroix of Paris in being chosen to hold a prestigious solo fashion show at the Victoria amp; Albert Museum in London, thereby indicating that Indian designers are increasingly meriting serious attention in the West. 

 Delhi-based Arora, 34, was given a solo slot at the V amp;A last night and showed off creations that use Indian textiles and embroidery but could not be further removed from the traditional style of clothes normally associated with either Bollywood or weddings. 

 He was picked for a category called Fashion in Motion, which has previously been given by the V amp;A to some of the best-known designers in the West Vivienne Westwood, Chloe, Stella McCartney, Alexander, Ozwald Boateng and Jean Paul Gaultier and Christian Lacroix. 

 The V amp;A said Arora is renowned for using vivid colour, lavish detailing and humour in his carefully crafted designs. 

 The museum added that Arora launched his own fashion label, Manish Arora, in 1997, three years after he graduated from the National Institute of Fashion Technology. 

 His selection, the last event in the India Now season, does not necessarily mean that Indian designers are now considered as good as their western counterparts. 

 Nor does it mean that fashion weeks in Delhi and Mumbai will immediately be treated with the same seriousness as those held in Paris, Milan, London and New York. 

 But the honour given to Arora suggests the Indian fashion industry is slowly getting there. 

 The person who picked Arora is Oriole Cullen, the curator of Fashion in Motion and also of Fashion and Textiles at the V amp;A. 

 Cullen said: Looking at Indian fashion and the Indian market at the moment, there is a real emergence of new markets and new talent and globally people are becoming aware of that, particularly in India and in China. 

 Explaining her choice of Arora, Cullen told The Telegraph: This summer we chose Manish Arora because it is obviously a fantastic opportunity to tie in with the India Now festival. Manishs designs were quite interesting in that they subvert. 

 She said: With Indian design, people initially see the bright colours and then, oh my goodness, you see the motifs, the amazing crafts and the skills that have been used on the textiles. There is something really joyous about his clothing and his work. He is, in a sense, translating ideas that people see as traditional Indian fashion, the colours and skills, into something that is more relevant for todays market. 

 Asked whether Indian designers were as good as their western counterparts, Cullen responded: That is something very difficult to quantify. There is a lot of great talent in India which we will see maturing over the next few years. The great thing is that there are two Indian designers showing in Paris Fashion Week this coming season, Manish being one of them. 

 On whether it was the Indian economy or Indian designers that was exciting interest in the West, Cullen said: It is a bit of both. There is no way Indian fashion would be attracting attention if it did not merit it. I do think Indian fashion is of a very high standard. 

 She pointed out: The way that the fashion world works is that it is drawn to new talent a lot of the fashion world looks to London for new creative ideas and, certainly, you get that sense of energy coming from India.

 As to when fashion week in Delhi and Mumbai would be placed on a par with those in London, Paris, Milan and New York, Cullen compared India with Italy: When you look back at the 1950s when Italy started as a fashion centre, initially there was Rome and Florence and Milan. It was quite fluid as to who would triumph as a fashion city so it will be interesting to see how it develops in India. But I have every confidence that India will become something on the international fashion map. 

 Arora, who emphasised that his policy was to stay away from Bollywood and weddings, said: Actually, I use a lot of Indian ideas and techniques and textiles and embroidery in a very contemporary way which can be understood by people globally, not just Indians. 

 He stressed: People are buying Indian clothes. I sell in London. I sell in Harrods, I sell in the overseas market, I sell in about 80 stores outside India which proves the fact that it is not just about the Indian economy. It is also about the product which one is selling is being accepted. 

 He was delighted to have been selected by the V amp;A: It is a very big deal, honestly. 

 Last year, he was present at the solo show presented by Lacroix: I never imagined I would do a show of my own. The fact that they have chosen me proves that Indian fashion is being accepted internationally.

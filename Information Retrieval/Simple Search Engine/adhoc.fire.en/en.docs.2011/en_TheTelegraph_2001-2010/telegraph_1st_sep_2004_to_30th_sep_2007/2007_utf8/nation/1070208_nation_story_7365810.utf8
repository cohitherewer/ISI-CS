 New Delhi, Feb. 7: Close to midnight, the urban development ministry notified the controversial Delhi Master Plan, the blueprint for the capitals growth and development till 2021.

 But the document is likely to lead to a protracted battle between various sections of Delhis population.

 The plan is now law, which shields lakhs of traders considered illegal under the earlier draft.

 Critics of the final Master Plan are, however, likely to oppose it in court a petition was filed against the plan earlier today in Delhi High Court, but it was rejected as the plan was yet to come in to effect. The battle for Delhi will have no such restrictions now.

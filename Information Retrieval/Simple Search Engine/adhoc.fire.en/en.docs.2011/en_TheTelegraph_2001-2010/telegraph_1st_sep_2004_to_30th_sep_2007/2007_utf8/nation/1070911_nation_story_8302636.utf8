 Mamata Nobel fight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mamata

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: Mamata Banerjee has asked Manmohan Singh to ensure that the CBI does not close important cases under political pressure from the CPM.

 In a memorandum to the Prime Minister, the Trinamul Congress leader said the communists had damaged the credibility of the premier investigating agency by extracting their pound of flesh from the government in return for supporting the central coalition.

 Mamata raised cases like the theft of Tagores Nobel medallion, Singur and Nandigram and asked the Congress-led Centre not to bow before the CPM.

 Trinamul sources said the Prime Minister expressed surprise that Nandigram and Singur were being revived and argued that the issues had cooled off. But Mamata, who met Singh for 15 minutes, disagreed and asserted that the CPMs highhandedness still prevailed at both places.

 Mamata did not restrict herself to memoranda. She tried to play up the Nobel theft by quitting the Visva-Bharati board in protest.

 In a letter to Singh she said she was grateful for being nominated to the board, but could not keep quiet after the government decided to close the CBI probe into the theft. So she was tendering her resignation.

 Mamata argued that the people of Bengal would lose faith in the CBI as there was an apprehension that the case was closed after the CPM-led state government put pressure on the Centre.

 The perception of the people is that the CPM is involved in this shameful crime, she said and also alleged that other CBI cases were either closed or the culprits not booked because of the pressure mounted by the Left Front government.

 Requesting the Prime Minister to reopen the Nobel theft case, she said a wrong message was going out to the country that the Centre, dependent on the CPM for its survival, was working according to the Left partys diktat.

 She also alleged that the CPM was threatening the officers involved with the probe and asked the Centre to stop all interference by the state government in the CBIs functioning.

 Mamata submitted another memorandum, which asked for a financial package to bail out sick tea gardens in North Bengal. She highlighted the plight of workers and demanded that a monitoring committee be set up to help the closed gardens and ensure healthcare and education for the workers.

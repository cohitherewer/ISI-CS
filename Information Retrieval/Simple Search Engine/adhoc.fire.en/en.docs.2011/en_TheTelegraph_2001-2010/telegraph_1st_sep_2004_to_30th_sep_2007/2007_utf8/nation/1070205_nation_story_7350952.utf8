 3-year-old falls into borewell

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Katni (Madhya Pradesh) Feb. 4: Thousands in Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere were offering prayers tonight for the life of a three-year-old who fell into a 50-foot borewell at Dhureshwar village in Katni district this afternoon.

 Till late tonight, Amit Kushwaha lay at a depth of 20 feet the good news was that he was breathing where hed been perched precariously for the past eight hours.

 The site, over 300 km from Bhopal, was humming with CCTV crews, earth-moving machines, fire brigades, army and paramedics involved in the rescue. But digging a parallel tunnel in the rocky terrain was taking time. 

 Collector Anupam Rajan said: Amit is absolutely fine and we are supplying oxygen into the pit. But the question on everybodys mind was whether Amit will be as lucky as Prince or lose the battle for life like Vijay Pal?

 Prince, the six-year-old rescued from a 60-foot hole in Kurukshetra, became a hero of sorts after his highly-televised rescue last year. Hed been trapped for over 50 hours. On the phone this evening, Princes mother, Karamjit, told Amits father, Rajendra Kushwaha, not to lose hope.

 But the fate of Vijay brought pessimism. The five-year-old Raisen kid was pulled out of a 25-foot hole, but died after the soil around caved in under the weight of onlookers.

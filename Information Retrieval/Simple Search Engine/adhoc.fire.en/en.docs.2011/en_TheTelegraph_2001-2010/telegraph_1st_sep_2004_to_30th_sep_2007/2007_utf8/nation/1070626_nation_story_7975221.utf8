 Diamonds shine in Maya list

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, June 25: Like Amitabh Bachchan, Mayavati is not a farmer. The Uttar Pradesh chief minister today declared Rs 52 crore worth of movable and immovable assets but no car or farmland.

 She furnished a list of her assets along with her nomination papers for a by-election to the Uttar Pradesh legislative council. The Bahujan Samaj Party leader, who was a Rajya Sabha member before becoming chief minister, needs to be a member of the state legislature to keep her chair.

 Her affidavit declared she owned diamonds as well as gold and silver ornaments worth Rs 50,87,529, and that her possessions included 1034.260 gm gold, 76.040 gm diamonds and silver dinner sets.

 She said she owned no shares or bonds, and had Rs 50.27 lakh in cash and Rs 12.88 crore in banks, financial institutions and non-banking financial companies.

 The immovable assets include three commercial and two residential buildings, together worth Rs 37.82 crore. The three commercial buildings are in New Delhi: one 3628.02sqft in area and worth Rs 2.05 crore, another that is 4535.02sqft and worth Rs 1.27 crore, and a third that is 34,112.26sqft (Rs 15.50 crore).

 One of the residential buildings is built on 1.08 acres in Lucknow and is worth Rs 97.42 lakh. The second, of 2194.4 square yards, is worth Rs 18.02 crore and is in New Delhi.

 Mayavati, accused in the Taj corridor corruption case where the governor has denied permission to prosecute her, claimed that no court had ever taken cognisance in any criminal case against her.

 Her predecessor Mulayam Singh Yadav is fighting a wealth case where he is accused of amassing unexplained assets of Rs 100 crore.

 Rahul connects in heartland drive

 Muzaffarnagar, March 20: If there was one big signal that went out of Rahul Gandhis three-day roadshow in Uttar Pradesh, it was this: he finally claimed the heartland as his prime political turf.

 And he proclaimed, loud and clear, that his path to Delhi would be through the state.

 Although my family lives in Delhi, my heart is with UP, he said as speakers anointed him bhavya pradhan mantri (future Prime Minister).

 There were no ifs and buts on his political plans. This is not a one-off visit, the young MP said. 

 I will come back again and again to these very places because I want to work shoulder-to-shoulder with you in building a golden future.

 One of those who hailed Rahul as a leader of the future was the Congresss new ally Rakesh Tikait, the son of Bharatiya Kisan Union founder Mahendra Singh Tikait, who is said to have considerable influence among Jats in at least four west Uttar Pradesh Assembly segments.

 Before a gathering of nearly 50,000, Rakesh declared that his outfit was supporting the Congress because we want to see Rahul Gandhi as the next PM.

 The roadshow has largely answered the disconcerting posers on when and if at all Rahul would fan out of family pocket boroughs Amethi and Rae Bareli into the badlands, though state leaders admitted it came two months too late before the elections.

 The choice of west Uttar Pradesh and Rohailkhand as the route for the Amethi MPs first hard launch was significant because the territory couldnt have been more hostile. The Congress had virtually ceded much of west Uttar Pradesh to the Lok Dal and its subsequent incarnations and later the BJP, while Rohailkhand, dominated largely by Muslims and backward castes, eluded its grasp in the Mandal-Mandir phase.

 Not surprisingly, Rahul, through his speeches and overtures, tried to reclaim part of the Congresss once famed rainbow coalition the happy mix of Brahmin, Muslim and Dalit votes. The most decisive was the way he sought to distance his party from the P.V. Narasimha Rao era.

 Hours before he reached Deoband yesterday, the seat of Dar-ul Uloom, the Islamic seminary whose contribution to the Independence movement was acknowledged again and again by Mahatma Gandhi, Rahul spoke of the Babri Masjids demolition.

 He picked on the demolition and the Congresss total sellout to the BSP in the 1996 alliance for the state polls as the most important reasons for his partys decline in the heartland. Had a member of the Gandhi family been in power then, neither would have happened, he asserted.

 Although Rahul didnt name Rao, his assertion that his father would have allowed the mosques demolition only over his dead body was the first serious political articulation of the feelings of large sections of the Congress which held the late Prime Minister responsible for alienating Muslims.

 Aussie hunt for Net proof

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 Haneef

 July 31: Australian immigration minister Kevin Andrews today cited chat room conversations between Mohammed Haneef and his brother in India to suggest that the doctor may have had prior knowledge of the botched terror plot in the UK.

 Haneefs lawyer Peter Russo said in Bangalore the information is hardly secret. It is more smoke and mirrors and not confidential evidence.

 Andrews, criticised for cancelling the doctors visa, said on the day Haneef attempted to leave Australia, he was told by his brother: Nothing has been found out about you.

 The minister said Haneefs brother asked him when he would get out of Australia. The doctor had replied today, Andrews said.

 The brother asked whether he had permission to take leave and what had he told the (Gold Coast) hospital. Haneef said he told them his baby was born in an emergency caesarean.

 Haneef was then told not to delay his departure and not let anyone else use his number in Australia, nor to give it to anyone.

 The brother added that auntie told him that brother Kafeel used it in some sort of protest over there, Andrews said, referring to UK terror accused Kafeel Ahmed.

 Russo today repeated his call for Andrews to release the material, saying the minister had used its existence to make slanderous allegations against the doctor. 

 He told a radio channel in Bangalore that the details revealed by Andrews had already been covered during a police interview.

 (Andrews) has led the Australian public to believe that this is the secret information, Russo said. It is hardly secret information if it was put to my client in the second record of interview.

 The information was also dismissed as political posturing by Imran Siddiqui, the cousin of Haneefs wife Firdous Arshiya.

 The minister said the Australian Federal Police (AFP) had told him before he made his visa decision that the police suspected the Inter-net conversation might be evidence that Haneef had prior knowledge of the bomb plot.

 British police, however, admitted today that initial information provided to Australian police leading to Haneefs arrest was incorrect. 

 The initial information provided was not correct and it was quickly remedied, a Scotland Yard spokeswoman told PTI.

 Learn from China, Left tells govt

 Karat: Heat on Centre

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: The CPM has hit out at the UPA government for the galloping inflation rate and asked it to take lessons from China.

 The argument that inflation is a consequence of rapid growth does not stand scrutiny. The Chinese economy has been registering rapid growth for three decades. Inflation is currently below 2 per cent in China, says an editorial in the latest issue of the partys mouthpiece, Peoples Democracy.

 The Left parties, instrumental in keeping the UPA in power, are clearly upset with the Centre for failing to control prices. The UPA government is squarely responsible for the present state of affairs, the editorial alleges.

 Usually, it is finance minister P. Chidamabaram who tells the Left to learn from China and its liberalisation policies. This time, the CPM has chosen to pay back the Centre in its own coin.

 The editorial comes a week before the budget session begins. The tone makes it clear the Left will put the government in its line of fire during the session. 

 The BJP is also planning to do the same. But the CPM will demarcate itself from the Opposition, saying the governments biggest failure was not being able to reverse the NDA regimes policies.

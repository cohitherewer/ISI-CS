 Gulistan pages found

 OIR CORRESPONDENT

 Gaya, June 16: The remaining pages of Gulistan bearing Aurangzebs golden calligraphy was recovered following a raid on a village this evening.

 On Thursday, police had retrieved 19 pages, including the cover, of the manuscript from Bajrangi Singh, a member of the gang that had stolen it.

 The remaining 102 pages of Gulistan, stolen from Tekari Raj School in December, was found in the house of Butai Singh, another member of the gang, at Chhakkan Bigha, about 30 km from here.

 With todays haul, the manuscript, copied in golden ink by the Mughal emperor from the original Gulistan, or Rose Garden, written by Persian philosopher Sheikh Saadi, is complete in itself.

 Gaya superintendent of police Amit Jain said Butai had fled.

 The book, kept in a school locker after being gifted by the king of Tekari, had been taken out only once by the royal family.

 The manuscript has lost its original bind as it was torn open by the thieves in their attempt to sell it in parts.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mulayam

 Lucknow, March 21: Mulayam Singh Yadavs season of anxiety is showing no signs of a thaw.

 As if the CBI probe into his properties wasnt enough, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister has found himself in more trouble after a rival candidate complained today that the Samajwadi Party leader submitted an incomplete list of assets with his nomination papers.

 Mulayam had yesterday filed his papers from Bhartana, in Etawah, a constituency he would be contesting in the coming state elections, besides Gunnaur in Badyun district.

 The Congress candidate from Bhartana, Ajay Singh Yadav, complained to the Election Commission that the chief minister had violated rules by withholding information on his assets.

 Ajay alleged that Mulayam submitted an assets list of Rs 5 crore though he had recently said in an affidavit to the Supreme Court that he owned properties worth Rs 30 crore. The Congress candidate whose late father Balram Singh Yadav was a BJP MP and was once close to the chief minister demanded that the poll panel cancel Mulayams nomination papers.

 The issue is now before the Election Commissions office in Etawah, which said the complaint has been forwarded to the panels Delhi office for a final decision.

 Sources said the commission might ask the chief minister to file fresh papers or reject the complaint.

 Mulayam, who is already facing a Supreme Court-ordered CBI probe following an allegation by another Congressman that he and his relatives own property worth Rs 100 core, had yesterday declared that he had cash, including bank deposits, worth Rs 35,51,926.65.

 The statement also mentioned, among others, 14.63 acres of farmland worth Rs 26,57,165, non-agricultural land worth Rs 56,000, a house in Etawah valued at Rs 33,03,757, electronic goods worth Rs 23,945 and furniture valued at Rs 5,93,090. 

 The chief minister said there were six bank deposits in his wife Sadhanas name worth Rs 15,76,163.95. He claimed he owned no vehicles but said his wife had two vehicles, a Toyota valued at over Rs 17 lakh and a two-wheeler.

 The statement said his wife has jewellery worth Rs 77,16,040.25, non-agricultural land in Lucknow valued at Rs 92,183, a house valued at Rs 10,16,800 and furniture worth Rs 80,044. It also mentioned furniture in his fathers name worth Rs 4,90,155.

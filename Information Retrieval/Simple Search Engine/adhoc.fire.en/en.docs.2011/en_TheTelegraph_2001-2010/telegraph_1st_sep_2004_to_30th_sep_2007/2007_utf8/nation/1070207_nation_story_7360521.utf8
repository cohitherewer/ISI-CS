 Sangh amp; CM cross swords

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 Modi,Raje

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: The RSS is faced with a peculiar problem it cannot get along with BJP leaders in states where the party is in power.

 First, Uma Bharti had a pitched battle with Sangh strongman Kaptan Singh Solanki when she was chief minister of Madhya Pradesh. Then Narendra Modis relations with the RSS strained to a point where the Sangh had to remove its Gujarat leader, Manmohan Vaidya, from the state. The latest in this line-up is Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje.

 Raje is currently countering a political offensive by four of her senior cabinet colleagues Ghanshyam Tiwari (minister for education), Gulab Chand Kataria (home), Madan Dilawar (social welfare) and Bhawani Joshi (health). All of them have threatened to resign to protest the chief ministers high-handedness, and the RSS unit in Rajasthan is openly supporting them.

 The turmoil in Rajasthan comes close on the heels of BJP president Rajnath Singh shunting out Modi from the all-powerful central parliamentary board. While Rajnaths personal ambitions may have prompted him to clip Modis wings, the decision was also said to have been aimed at pleasing the Sangh brigade in Gujarat.

 RSS veterans, however, blame the outfits state units for interfering too much.

 They carp about the chief ministers supposedly autocratic style of functioning. We basically feel it is a clash of egos. The local units have been told to stay away from the faction fight within the BJP. Regretfully, our people are openly biased, especially against the chief minister in Rajasthan, said a senior RSS leader.

 Rajnath seems to be at his wits end tackling the tussle in Rajasthan that is rapidly developing into a political crisis.

 Raje has taken the cooperatives department away from the social welfare minister and allocated it to her loyalist, Prabhu Lal Sahni. Dilawar and the other three ministers claim it is a deliberate snub. 

 Rajnath separately met Raje and three of the four dissidents Kataria, Dilawar and Tiwari on Sunday but reportedly could satisfy neither side.

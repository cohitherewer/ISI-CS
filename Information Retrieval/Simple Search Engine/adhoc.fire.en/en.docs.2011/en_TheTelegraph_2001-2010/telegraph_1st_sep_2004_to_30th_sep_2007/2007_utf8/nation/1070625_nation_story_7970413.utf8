 Rajnath pep pill for party

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 24: Leave the Uttar Pradesh, Goa and other debacles behind, look at the elections ahead, set right the rot within and make sure there are no Babubhai Kataras or other embarrassments lurking.

 This is expected to be president Rajnath Singhs sermon to the BJPs national executive, which sits for a two-day session from tomorrow. 

 While zero tolerance to indiscipline will figure prominently in his opening address, sources said, the Uttar Pradesh rout will not. 

 It will be touched upon on the last day when reports from the states are perfunctorily discussed. 

 Rajnaths morale-boosters will be that by ruling solo or in alliance in 10 states, we are ruling over half the population and we are the principal Opposition at the Centre. He is also likely to iterate L.K. Advanis line that the BJP has been instrumental in making Indian politics bipolar.

 To maximise the partys geographical spread, the executive members will be told that the next three months should be used to reorganise units at every level to ensure the BJP is there in every (election) booth. 

 In the rainy season, we cant plan for public meetings and rallies, so the party should concentrate on the organisation, said spokesman Prakash Javadekar. 

 For the first time, specialists from outside, including agricultural scientist M.S. Swaminathan, will address the gathering. 

 With the presidential election approaching, the meeting is expected to brief members on its political implications. There are murmurs in the BJP questioning what the party had hoped to achieve by raking up dirt on the UPA-Left candidate, Pratibha Patil.

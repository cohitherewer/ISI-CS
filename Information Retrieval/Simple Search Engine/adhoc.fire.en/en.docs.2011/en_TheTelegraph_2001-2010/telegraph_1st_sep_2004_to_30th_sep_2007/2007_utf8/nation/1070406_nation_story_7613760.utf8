 The

 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Book mark in clean-up drive

 After special bins and plans to shame litterbugs, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is turning a new leaf in its drive to get the city clean and green. It has published a pocket book listing its rules.

 Written in English and Marathi, the book is meant to serve as a ready reckoner for citizens and civic authorities. The manual will be available from next month at the office of the corporations public relations officer.

 We are sending complimentary copies to around 150 establishments, institutions or NGOs who participated in the process of framing the bylaws by giving feedback. Around 1,000 copies each will be sent to ward offices for the reference of BMC officials, an official said. 

 Through the book, the corporation is trying to spread awareness about the need to push its cleanliness drive by explaining to people their duties and responsibilities. Not long back, Vidya Thakur, the new deputy mayor, said she would start womens special buses. The wheels of change at the BMC have rarely moved faster.

 All-woman hospital

 A clinic in the capital metamorphosed last week into what is being described as north Indias first all-woman hospital, where all diagnostic and medical services are provided exclusively to women. More important, women make up 90 per cent of the clinics staff.

 Fortis La Femme will now offer preventive health checks, bone density measurements and cancer detection services, besides a range of cosmetic surgery and non-invasive procedures. These include facelifts, rhinoplasty, botox and laser removal of wrinkles and acne.

 The hospital says its ambience and services are designed to create a relaxing environment for women. It will continue to offer maternity services with foetal monitoring services, labour rooms and neo-natology clinics. 

 Break-up pangs

 A heritage building that houses St Anns School, among the most popular in Hyderabad, is being partly demolished. The reason: many students died in accidents because a portion of the structure had shrunk the road space.

 We plan to start the demolition during summer holidays and hire another building to run the school till the reconstruction is over, said Charlotte Sequeira, the president of St Anns Educational Society. 

 Headmistress Sister Cicily Mathew said it was painful to see a portion of the 136-year-old building come down, but it was more unbearable to watch students die in accidents caused by traffic jams on the road outside. 

 The construction of a flyover had caused more problems for the school, whose former students include astronaut Rakesh Sharma, actress Diana Hayden and Magsaysay award winner Shanta Sinha.

 Time to reboot

 Indias booming infotech sector faces a talent crunch. Some of us had known that for some time. Now, many in the countrys Silicon Valley feel the hiring pool cant remain so small.

 At a seminar last week to brainstorm on ways to sustain the boom, some industry honchos suggested roping in science, commerce and arts graduates for software jobs. So far, its those with a grounding in technology who have called the shots.

 One executive said Indian IT companies will need 16 lakh hands over the next five years and, if only engineers were to be hired, no more than five to six lakh will get past the job door. Time to reboot the system, folks.

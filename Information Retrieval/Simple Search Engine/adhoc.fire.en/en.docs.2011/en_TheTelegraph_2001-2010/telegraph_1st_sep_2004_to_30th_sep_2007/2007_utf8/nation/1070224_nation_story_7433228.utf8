 Chikungunya test repeat

 A STAFF REPORTER

 VIRAL THREAT

 Chikungunya symptoms

 High temperature

 Joint pain and swelling

 Rashes all over body

 In severe cases, deformities

 Danger

 Morbidity rate is high

Calcutta, Feb. 23: A man who tested positive for chikungunya this week will be tested again because he doesnt have the symptoms, government officials said today.

 Calcutta Municipal Corporation health officials will collect blood from Shakil Khan, 38, tomorrow and send it for tests at the School of Tropical Medicine.

 Khan, a resident of Prince Ghulam Mohammad Shah Road, had visited the outpatients department at the Bhagirathi Neotia Women and Child Care Centre on February 19, complaining of fever and joint pain.

 The hospital had collected a blood sample and sent it to a private laboratory, where it tested positive for chikungunya.

 But member, mayor-in-council (health), Subodh De, said civic health officials visited Khans home today and found that he has neither fever nor any pain.

 The initial test was positive but more tests are required for confirmation. And even if the (confirmatory) tests are positive, it will be considered an old case, said S.N. Dutta, joint director, public health.

 He said state health department staff had combed the locality where Khan lives but found no other suspected chikungunya cases.

 As a precaution, the vector control department has beefed up its anti-mosquito drive in the area. Like dengue, chikungunya also spreads through the Aedes aegypti mosquito.

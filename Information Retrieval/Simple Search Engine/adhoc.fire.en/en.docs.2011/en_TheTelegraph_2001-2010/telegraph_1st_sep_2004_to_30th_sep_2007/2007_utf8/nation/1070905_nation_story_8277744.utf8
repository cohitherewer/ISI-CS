 Databank on missing kids

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 

 New Delhi, Sept. 4: Information on missing children across the country will soon be available at the click of a mouse on a database that would hasten the process of finding and uniting them with their families. 

 The centralised database will be updated every 15 days, officials said. 

 Over 45,000 children go missing every year in the country and 11,000 are never traced, according to a recent study by the National Human Rights Commission. 

 For the first time in India, law enforcers who come across a delinquent child will have access to a consolidated database that would tell them in an instant if the child is missing, and from where he is missing, a senior official in the ministry of women and child development said today. 

 The database, the official said, would be maintained by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, set up by the Centre after the Nithari child murders in Noida. 

 The child rights panel today prepared letters to be sent to all state police chiefs the directors-general of police in all cases, except for Delhi that has a police commissioner informing them of the database. The letters are likely to be sent tomorrow, because of a government holiday today. 

 For over a year now, child rights activists and senior police officers such as Kiran Bedi have been raising the demand for the database, which officials admit is not hard to maintain. 

 As reported in The Telegraph on July 2, the National Human Rights Commission had recommended that such a database be created and maintained by the child rights panel. 

 The panel, in its letter, has asked the police chiefs to provide names, addresses and parents identity of all the children who go missing or are found every 15 days. 

 The police station where the case is registered will be available on the website. So, a police officer who finds a child, perhaps working as a child labourer somewhere, can easily track down where the child went missing, Sandhya Bajaj, a member of the child rights panel, said. 

 The database, officials said, would also help reunite a missing child with his family. One of the biggest challenges in getting children back to their parents is verification of identity. That process will be significantly simplified with the database, Bajaj said.

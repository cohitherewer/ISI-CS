 Amartya health push

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Feb. 10: Nobel laureate Amartya Sen today called for recognising health as a basic human right as it generally enhances capabilities.

 Being alive is a necessary requirement for carrying out the plans and projects that we have reason to value and pursue, and there are not great many things we can do if we are not here at all, he said.

 The economist, delivering a lecture here in memory of the late K.S. Sanjivi who had started voluntary health services in semi-urban and rural areas of Tamil Nadu, said health as a right could be promoted through voluntary efforts and social ethics.

 Sen cited Chinas pre- and post-reforms experience to make the point that sudden privatisation of health insurance in that country had a role in the slowdown of longevity there. There are lessons for India from this, he added.

 Speaking on school education, he said he would address the Left-affiliated All Bengal Primary Teachers Association in Calcutta on Monday and stress on accountability of teachers without which the system cannot be improved.

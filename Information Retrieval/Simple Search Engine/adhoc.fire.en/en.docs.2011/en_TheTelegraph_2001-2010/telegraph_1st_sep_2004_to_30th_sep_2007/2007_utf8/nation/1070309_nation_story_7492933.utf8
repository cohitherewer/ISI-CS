 Asia railway

 New Delhi, March 8: India will help build a trans-Asian railway that will connect Asia and Europe, reports our special correpondent. 

 The Union cabinet tonight cleared signing and ratifying the inter-government agreement on the railway. Several Asian countries, including Russia, China, Iran, Nepal and Sri Lanka, have already joined the initiative started by the UN last year.

 In another decision, the cabinet cleared a revised plan for work on a memorial for fallen policemen, stalled by protests over its design. The National Police Memorial was coming up in the diplomatic enclave, but its large steel frame holding a giant globe was seen as an eyesore by urban planning experts. Construction was halted after the row reached court.

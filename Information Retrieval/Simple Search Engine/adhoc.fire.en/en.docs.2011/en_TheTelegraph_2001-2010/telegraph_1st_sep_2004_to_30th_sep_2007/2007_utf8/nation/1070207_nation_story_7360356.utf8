 Sanjay tastes bias jeers

 Mumbai, Feb. 6: As he walked into the anti-terror court today, Sanjay Dutt was greeted not by the usual chants of Sanju Baba but by placards.

 Sanjay Dutt nayak, hum khalnayak (Sanjay a hero, and us villains)? asked one. Sanjay Dutt chale plane mein, Musalmaan sare jail mein (Sanjay flies high on planes, we Muslims go to jail), mused a second.

 The brief protest by parents and relatives of the other Tada (anti-terror law) convicts, who alleged the actor was getting preferential treatment, overshadowed the arguments on Sanjays plea for probation for good conduct. The court extended his bail till tomorrow when the prosecution begins its argument.

 One placard put it all down to Sanjays political connections his late father was, and his sister is, a Congress MP. CBI ka saath hain, Sonia mummy ka bhi haath hain, Sharad Pawar ka aashirwad hain, Sanjay Dutt ki kya baat hain (Oh to be Sanjay! The CBI is on his side, Sonias lending a hand and Sharad Pawar his blessings). 

 The 50-odd protesters, who had arrived from Raigad, Bhiwandi and Malegaon, were quickly whisked away by police and 38, including 24 women, were detained for a while.

 Inside the court waited a hand-written application seeking an end to alleged discrimination in Sanjays favour. The 69 co-accused all convicted under Tada who signed it said the charges against them were similar to those against Dutt, so they too should be acquitted of Tada charges and tried again under ordinary law.

 The judge admitted the application, asking the CBI to reply tomorrow.

 Far from the protesters ears, Sanjays counsel V.R. Ma-nohar told the court the actor was special: after all, his parents Sunil Dutt and Nargis were Padma Shris and the family did a lot of social work.

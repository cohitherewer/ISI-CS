 Pet death drives couple to suicide

 A retired soldier and his wife hanged themselves last Thursday, unable to cope with the pain from the death of their dog who had been with them for over 13 years.

 C.N. Madanraj, 66, and his wife Tara Bai, 63, were found hanging at their home in Gowthamnagar Colony on Sunday after neighbours told police about a foul smell coming from their house, police officer V. Anantaiah said.

 The couple left behind a suicide note and Rs 2,000 to pay for their own funeral saying they were ending their lives after the death of Puppy. The note also requested that police inform their relatives about their deaths. 

 The childless couple had buried Puppy in the compound of their house on Wednesday after a tearful farewell. A feast was also held in memory of their pet. 

 Dogs have a huge impact on their owners lives, said Vasanti Vadi, secretary of People for Animals, which had helped the couple organise the funeral for their pet. 

 Red signal for rally raj

 Bengal finally has some company when it comes to traffic-stopper protests. Last week, Andhra Pradesh High Court tried to slam the brakes on such rallies in Hyderabad by suggesting a penalty of Rs 50 lakh on parties.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice G.S. Singhvi said protests that hurt the common mans livelihood were illegal. The observation came on a public interest petition filed against a blockade held by Opposition parties that want a planned IIT set up in Adilabad, instead of Medak. 

 he activists refused to let vehicles, including ambulances, pass and turned the highway into a kabaddi ground. The court gave the government 24 hours to file a counter-affidavit describing the action it plans to take. The lawyer representing political parties that had organised the agitation was given time till April 9. The message: the government cant let the city stop. 

 Tongue-tied wonder

 He is himself a picture many wouldnt have seen. But R. Rajendrans portraits arent about a few brush strokes. The 25-year-old artist doesnt hold the brush between his fingers, but by his tongue-folding it into a groove.

 Rajendran has been perfecting the craft for the past seven years, having painted a portrait of President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. It took him 127 hours to pull off the feat. 

 The Pondicherry wonder is poised to break into the Limca Book of Records for his unique style of painting. A few weeks ago, he showcased his skills to a tongue-tied gathering at a popular beach in the city. The tongue-twisting artists next challenge is to paint a 30-feet-by-20 feet-portrait of Mother Teresa. That will get him where he ultimately wants to go the Guinness Book of Records.

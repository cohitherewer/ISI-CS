 Defence gets govt message on US

 SUJAN DUTTA 

 AK Antony

 New Delhi, Aug. 13: A quiet determination to intensify engagements with the US and its allies has overtaken the Indian military establishment despite reservations from China and Iran and domestic pressure from the Left.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs willingness to take on his detractors on the civilian nuclear deal has also been taken as a signal that the defence establishment can be unabashed in its external engagements that are loaded in favour of the US. 

 Officials of the defence ministry will not put it on record but in armed forces headquarters in South Block, the quadri (meaning the quadrilateral involving the US, Japan, Australia and Singapore) with its distinct bias against China is the flavour of the season.

 Senior bureaucrats and military officers in the defence ministry say that Indias course of multilateral military cooperation would not be abandoned in a hurry but we have to acknowledge that we engage most with those who best serve our interests. 

 They also believe that the Lefts protests against the September war games will be like its sloganeering against the exercises with the US Air Force in Kalaikunda, Bengal, last year that did not go beyond tokenism. 

 In Parliament today, defence minister A.K. Antony repeated that Indias armed forces were engaging several countries not only the US in military exercises. Earlier, he had pointed out that engagements with the US and Israel have been pursued by every government meaning I.K. Gujrals United Front and Atal Bihari Vajpayees NDA since the early 1990s. But even against that backdrop, the current phase of engagements is by far the most intensive. 

 From September 4 to 7, India will host the largest war games in its waters the 10th episode of the Malabar series since 2001 with 20 ships from four countries. 

 The second Malabar exercise of the year comes within four months after the US Navy practically hand-held the Indian Navy to the Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force for drills off Chinas east coast. But Delhi still chose to be discreet, sending a small group from its eastern flotilla to make port calls to China even while exercising with the Americans. 

 A comparable move is likely later in the year. While holding the complex Malabar 07-02 involving three aircraft carriers, ship and shore-based planes and a nuclear submarine, a small Indian Army team will also plan for an elementary search and rescue drill with the Chinese in October. 

 In May, China issued a demarche a diplomatic missive seeking information to India, the US, Australia and Japan asking for details on their proposed quadrilateral security initiative. Since then, the word has been quietly dropped even as the engagements have been intensified. 

 Recent Chinese protestations against alleged border infringements in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh are also being interpreted in the defence ministry as objections to the quadri developments. 

 Last week, an Indian Army team was also in Mongolia, Chinas northern neighbour, for a peacekeeping drill co-hosted by the Mongolian defence ministry and the US department of defence. 

 When the eastern fleet is busy in the Bay of Bengal, the navys western fleet will also be deployed in the Persian Gulf. The navy claims this as a huge accomplishment the ability to deploy on both Indian seaboards. 

 The western fleet will engage with elementary and complex exercises with the British and the French, and make port calls to Arab states. 

 However, Iran has been left out of its three-week deployment programme in the Persian Gulf because, as a senior naval officer said: We have not been able to generate an invitation from Tehran.

 The Iranian navy chief had visited India earlier in the year. Besides, the India-Iran friendly naval engagement is older than the current flush of India-US naval engagement. The Indian and Iranian naval fleets also have platforms (like Kilo-class submarines) that have originated from the same source (Soviet Russia). 

 India is currently shipping all its requirements for a road project in Afghanistan through Irans main Bandar Abbas port. It has also promised to assist in Chabahar port. With Pakistan denying transit rights, Iran is the main surface connect that India uses to ferry material to Afghanistan.

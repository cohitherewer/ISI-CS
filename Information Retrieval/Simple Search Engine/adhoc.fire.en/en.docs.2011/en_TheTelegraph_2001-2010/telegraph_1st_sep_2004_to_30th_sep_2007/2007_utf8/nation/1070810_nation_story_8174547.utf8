 Sibling rivalry springs up in UP farm war 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Aug. 9: The green light to contract farming in Uttar Pradesh has prompted a strike threat by the Samajwadi Party, which accuses the Mayavati government of working to help a big industrial house.

 The Samajwadi Party has called a statewide shutdown of mandis government-controlled wholesale markets on August 14 to protest a move it says will destroy the farmer and the small trader.

 Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Retail Limited is set to enter the states agricultural market, a Reliance source said, after the government last week opened the farm sector to private players with a net worth of Rs 500 crore and above.

 Samajwadi Party MP Mohan Singh pointed to the cut-off figure, alleging this was meant to prevent local industries from competing. This is clearly to help a big industrial house, he said.

 Singhs party is believed to be close to Mukeshs brother Anil Ambani, who had started his Dadri power project in the state when it had a Samajwadi Party government. The project continues to be stalled by the failure of Mukesh-promoted Reliance Industries Limited to supply gas.

 Mayavati has said: There is no shadow of any family rivalry on my agriculture policy. I just want to ensure good seed and agricultural aid for the farmers and link their products to the market.

 Under contract farming, investors strike a deal with farmers for the cultivation of a particular crop. The companies promise to help them with seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and other requirements, and agree to buy the produce at a pre-determined price.

 Contract farming would allow Reliance Retail, set to open a network of department stores in the state, to buy directly from farmers.

 The state government has already amended a law that gave sole control of wholesale crop markets to the government, making room for private operators.

 Several farmers associations affiliated to the Samajwadi Party are trying to organise the states cultivators against the pro-industrialist Mayavati government.

 The governments decision to open up the farm sector will spell doom for the farmers and destroy the small traders in the districts, Singh said.

 Mayavati has said: The policy will not be pushed down the farmers throats. They can accept it or reject it.

 Cabinet secretary Sheshank Shekhar said the government would draft a model contract form to be signed by the farmer and the industrialist. The state will act as a facilitator, he said.

 Chief secretary P.K. Mishra said: The system is working fine in China, so why not here?

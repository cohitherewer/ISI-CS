 Leeds, June 9: Shah Rukh Khan might not be present in person at the IIFA in Yorkshire but his spirit is very much in the air in Leeds.

 For a complex set of reasons, possibly to do with his relationship with Amitabh Bachchan, the brand ambassador of IIFA, Shah Rukh is the one serious omission from the Bollywood cast that has arrived for the awards ceremony that was due to be held in Sheffield tonight.

 However, he has been able to do what no other Indian film star has managed inspire an entire play.

 Bollywood Jane, the tale of a 15-year-old Yorkshire lass who is drawn by Bollywood films, is a play that makes frequent use of the music, clips and Shah Rukh and Kajol posters from Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.

 Indeed, huge posters of Shah Rukh and Kajol adorn the walls of the West Yorkshire Playhouse, one of the most important regional theatres in the country, where the play started on June 2 and will run until the end of this month.

 It is again the image of Shah Rukh and Kajol that is used in promotional literature for the play and if the audience overwhelmingly white on Friday evening had not heard of Shah Rukh before, they certainly have now.

 The play has been written not by an Indian or Pakistani but an Englishwoman, Amanda Whittington, who first started writing the script in 2001 as a screenplay.

 I loved Bollywood music Id seen Bollywood movies and had been captivated by them. I thought, This sounds so theatrical, I would love to write something that involves this music. Then I thought, How can I? Im white, its not my culture or my background. How can I presume to write about Bollywood?

 She added: Then I had the idea one day: write about it from a white perspective. Create a white character who stumbles upon it and goes on this wide-eyed journey of discovery. That was my way in.

 She said the character of Jane sees Bollywood as the land of Oz. But it is also about all sorts of things: growing up, falling in love, sexuality and religion.

 All the dance sequences use local Yorkshire girls, white and Asian.

 The film that Whittington chose for Jane to fall in love with is Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge a sort of Bollywood Romeo and Juliet, about a boy and girl who meet, fall in love, cant be together but love wins through.

 Shah Rukh would be pleased.

 Sea yoga drowns teacher amp; student

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 7: A yoga instructor and his film producer-student drowned in the sea off Versova while trying to perform exercises in the water.

 The duo have been identified as Gopal Kapila, 64, and Jainendra Kumar Bhagwan Kutiyar, 37, a small-time producer from Mira Road in Thane district.

 Police said Kutiyar, who had joined the classes two days ago, had gone to Kapilas Versova home in the north-west suburb of Andheri in the morning for yoga lessons.

 On Saturday, Kapila told Kutiyar that he would demonstrate water yoga lessons with pranayam, and took him to Versova beach. Minutes after both entered the sea around 9am, they were swept away by the strong current, said a police officer at Versova police station.

 Locals and morning walkers on the beach fished out their bodies and rushed them to Cooper Hospital in Juhu. Kutiyar died on the way. Doctors tried to resuscitate Kapila, but failed, the police said.

 Kutiyar produced small budget films, and owned a firm, Kutiyar Films and Entertainment Limited.

 Not as popular as regular yoga, its water version is usually performed by experts. It involves some standing exercises with pranayam as well as performing asanas while floating. 

 Experts believe water yoga is more effective than that on land and improves immunity levels dramatically and purifies the digestive system. Water-based yoga therapies are also practised at popular spa resorts.

 Two years ago, Mumbais deputy municipal commissioner G.R. Khairnar was admitted to the intensive care unit after he went on a yoga overdrive with more than 12 hours of exercises.

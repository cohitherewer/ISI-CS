 Home truths in makeover plan

 Slum-dwellers are paying the price of a central government plan that aims to change the face of Chennai.

 Evictions, many of them carried out ruthlessly under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, have driven countless people in shanties to the brink.

 The demolition machine has rolled over 30,000 riverside hutments (mainly along the Cooum and Adyar rivers) as part of the missions river-cleaning drive.

 NGOs fighting for the slum-dwellers are crying foul. They are citing an assurance from Union urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy that there should be no evictions as the central scheme takes shape on the ground.

 One NGO has drawn attention to studies that show untreated effluent released into the two rivers. Armed with the findings, it says picking on slum-dwellers is not fair.

 In many cases, when the displaced were shifted, they had to pay for the accommodation and for water. 

 Some say the conditions are right for Medha Patkar to step in.

 Holes need a cover-up

 If the mounds of garbage werent enough, it is the holes of death now. Hyderabad has to clean up its act fast.

 Last year, a bank manager was swept away to death in a manhole after she slipped off her husbands scooter during a downpour. 

 Not long before that, two school children fell into a similar trap. Their bodies were found floating in a drain miles from where they disappeared.

 he civic bodies have launched a massive campaign ahead of the monsoon to put a lid on all such holes and controversies. But they have a long way to go: around 2 lakh traps will have to be covered in a month. 

 There is also a move to warn people with signboards. But road-widening plans and the Hyderabad Metro project have made the cover-up job more difficult.

 Mock test at airport

 Sirens, clear-out orders, sniffer dogs and bomb squads the Delhi international airport went into a tailspin one afternoon this week. But the tension lasted only a few minutes.

 Luckily for passengers, nothing perilous happened, and they soon realised it was a mock drill staged to test the preparedness of authorities to react to a bomb threat.

 ut those put through the paces proved they were up to their job: the agencies swung into action and evacuated passengers from the terminal in three minutes. They were taken some distance away from the centre.

 The mock exercise was carried out by Delhi International Airport (the company that runs the aviation hub), the CISF, the bureau of civil aviation security and Delhi polices bomb-detection and disposal squads. 

 The exercise was meant to be a drill to see just how well authorities handle a crisis that can occur when there is a bomb threat or a fire, an airport official said.

 Ticket pinch

 Getting around in Delhi will cost more with the government deciding to raise bus, three-wheeler and taxi fares.

 The minimum fare for buses will be Rs 3, up from Rs 2, but the maximum of Rs 10 stays.

 For autos, Rs 10 will be the least one must pay (up from Rs 8). For later stages, the fare has been increased from Rs 3.50 per km to Rs 4.50. 

 Taxis will charge you Rs 15 at the least. After the first slab, the fare will go up from Rs 7 per km to Rs 8.50. Chartered and AC bus tickets could also become dearer.

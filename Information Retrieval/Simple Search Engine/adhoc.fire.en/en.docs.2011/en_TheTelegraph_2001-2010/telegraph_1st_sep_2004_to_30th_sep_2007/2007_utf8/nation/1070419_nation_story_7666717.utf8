 Wishful wardrobe

 (From top) What the students

 want Aishwarya, Abhishek, Jaya and Amitabh

 to wear 

 Mumbai, April 18: If Aishwarya Rai has any doubt how to capture that radiant look on her wedding day, she might ask Binal Gala. The 19-year-old knows exactly what the bride should be wearing.

 A red sari? Nah!

 The student of the International Institute of Fashion Design has designed a grey-and-blue ensemble for the sophisticated Ash, embellished with silver embroidery.

 The borders are diamond-studded. I thought she can surely afford real diamonds, laughs Binal, who has priced her outfit at Rs 90,000.

 A pity that Ash cant write a cheque and walk away with the dress, though. The design is just on paper.

 So are those by Binals peers at the institute, which asked its 100 students to design the dresses for Ash, groom Abhishek and his parents to wear on the big date.

 Abhishek used to experiment a lot. I hated his floral shirts, said Shane Lonan, 20. Now, he has sobered down. He looks great in black and grey. But if you look closely, his collars and cuffs have prints on them and he has a dash of red in almost everything. I have designed this sherwani for him with an Indo-western touch.

 Most of the students admire the Bachchan sense of style, but think Jaya can do better. If Hema Malini can look that good, why cant Jaya? said Khushmeet Suri.

 The 17-year-old has designed an olive-green pure silk sari a cool mixture of crystal beadwork and embroidery with the borders embellished with zardosi. Keeping in mind Jayas age, I have given her a soft fabric. It costs Rs 80,000.

 Poonam Singal is thrilled with her subject: Big B himself. Whatever he wears that day will create a style statement. Not only India but the international market will be watching. So, I have created this mehendi-coloured sherwani using jamdani brocade. I didnt want to give him an ordinary colour. Im sure he can afford it at just Rs 2.5 lakh.

 This was the most topical theme to give our students. An assignment like this makes them work with double the passion and excitement, said V. Gautam, institute director.

 Binal, Khushmeet and Poonam have jointly topped the contest. If the designs match the wedding pictures whenever they come out, that will be the real prize.

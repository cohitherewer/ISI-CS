 House stalls over panel

 Advani: Blatant violation

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: The Opposition has taken exception to the UPA-Left committee on the nuclear agreement, describing it as a deliberate and blatant violation of Parliaments rights, prerogatives and privileges. 

 NDA and third front members kicked up a ruckus in the House, paralysing both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for the whole day.

 The BJP signalled its resolve not to allow Parliament to function if their voice is not paid heed to. A statement released by leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani today said: The setting up of a private committee is a total negation of the Oppositions rights and role in Parliament.

 The statement came amid rumours that the government was planning to adjourn Parliament sine die without a debate on the deal.

 Later, however, it was revealed that the debate is scheduled for tomorrow and the day after.

 Advani said the entire exercise had been rendered meaningless after the creation of the UPA-Left committee. The 15-member panel has been set up to go into the Lefts concerns on the nuclear deal. Its first meeting is likely to be held between September 9 and 13.

 The government has pre-empted the debate, Advani said. What is the meaning if the deal has been subjected to the outcome of the mechanism?

 Describing the NDA demand for a joint parliamentary committee as reasonable, Advani asked how a private panel could decide whether a deal was in national interest.

 Had the government stuck to its original position that international treaties are not scrutinised, we could have accepted that position. But having accepted the demand for a committee under Left pressure, the government cannot say Parliament has no role.

 The statement said the mechanism has trivialised an issue that will impact national security for the next 50 years. 

 The government has voluntarily handed over decision-making to the Left Front. There is now apparently no central government effectively holding the reins of office... the government must recognise the perilous path on which they are obstinately set, it added.

 Advani also cleared doubts about his personal stand on the nuclear issue. In the name of energy security, lets not jeopardise national security, he said.

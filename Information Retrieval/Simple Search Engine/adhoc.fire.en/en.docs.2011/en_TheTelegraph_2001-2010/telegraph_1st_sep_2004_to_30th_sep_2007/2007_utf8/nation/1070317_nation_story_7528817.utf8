 MDMK pulls out of Centre

 Chennai, March 16: The Vaiko-led MDMK today pulled out of the UPA coalition, reports our special correspondent. Cracks had been increasing over the past year, particularly on the issue of Sri Lankan Tamils.

 The decision was taken at the partys regional conference in Coimbatore, a spokesperson said. But left with just two MPs in the Lok Sabha after a split in the party, the MDMK pullout does not threaten the government.

 The MDMK, which had earlier pulled out of the DMK-led coalition in Tamil Nadu, accused the Congress and the Centre of continuing to encourage the anti-democratic, minority and fascist DMK government in the state.

 Shilpa threat to sue Kavita

 AMIT ROY 

 Shilpa: Tough talk

 London, July 24: Shilpa Shetty today denied being involved romantically with businessman Raj Kundra, whom she described as a part of my team, and threatened to take legal action if his estranged wife, Kavita, continued to claim that the Bollywood actress was instrumental in breaking up her marriage. 

 If she continues to TARNISH my name out of any insecurity or otherwise, I will consider taking legal action as I see no reason why my name is being dragged into this mess, warned Shilpa, who put Tarnish in capital letters. 

 The gist of Shilpas long statement is that she met Kundra three months ago, long after his marriage had broken down, and that although he had now become a friend, having worked hard on her perfume project, she was not a marriage wrecker. 

 We are also now friends, which by no angle is a crime in any part of the world, said Shilpa. 

 She lamented: If I was linked to every friend I had I would have no friends left. 

 However, if Shilpa really is contemplating legal action, it is not 25-year-old Kavita Kundra she will have to take on but two of the most aggressive newspapers in the world the News of the World and the Mail on Sunday which carried Kavitas (admittedly hysterical) allegations. They have very deep pockets and relish nothing better than slugging it out in the courts, and without the protection of PR king Max Clifford, from whom Shilpa has parted company she said she was not dumped by him she will emerge with her reputation and family finances totally ruined. 

 As it is, Kavitas name was not even mentioned when the Daily Mail columnist Richard Kay published the following on July 4: Shilpa Shettys mother, Sunanda, has made no secret of her desire for her daughter to find a suitable match and now her prayers may just have been answered. The 32-year-old Celebrity Big Brother bombshell has found love with one of Britains Asian entrepreneurs self-made millionaire Raj Kundra, 30. London-born Kundra, the son of a gold and diamond trader, has made a 6 million fortune in fashion, diamonds and film. He is also the man behind Shilpas new perfume, S2, and the couple began their fragrant affair last month while working on the scent. 

 Now, if she wants to take legal action, she will have to confront the Daily Mail as well. She might very well win but the process could also bankrupt her. The papers will hire the best media lawyers in town and they will trawl through Shilpas best background. 

 Shilpas outrage, though, is completely understandable. Although one cannot be 100 per cent sure, she probably is telling the truth when she insists Kundra is just a friend. But the indications are that Kundra, a 31-year-old yet to make his mark on London society, is, as Clifford suggested yesterday, besotted with Shilpa. Kundra, it seems, is now having to contend with a very angry wife scorned and one literally left holding the baby at home but determined to lash out against her husband with everything she has got. 

 This is the context against which to view Shilpas statement, issued from her home in Mumbai through her new PR agency in London, Sterling Media. 

 The latter proudly announced today: Sterling Media has won the PR account for Shilpa Shetty, acclaimed Bollywood actress who shot straight into the mainstream through her win in Celebrity Big Brother 2007.

 Army of peace in others wars

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is to address nearly 3,000 Indian troops headed for duties with the UN in Africa on April 5 in an acknowledgement that the international commitment now accounts for the largest operational deployment of the Indian Army outside Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast.

 Around 9,000 Indians 10 per cent from central police organisations are currently deployed for UN peace missions, mostly in Africa. 

 This is the highest number of personnel that the Indian Army has assigned to UN duties, the additional director- general (staff duties), Major General R.P.S. Malhan, said here yesterday. Malhan heads the UN cell in army headquarters.

 Since July last year, Indian troops with the UN have been caught between other peoples wars but casualties have been low three killed and nine injured in accidents. 

 The longest and most trying of these wars was Israels over the Hizbollah in Lebanon. 

 The 4 Sikh battalion that was deployed on the thin blue line between Lebanon and Israel and was commended by the UN has now been rotated and replaced by the 15 Punjab.

 India has also been sounded for more personnel, particularly in Sudan where an Indian soldier was killed earlier this week. The Sudanese government is yet to agree to UN troops in its strife-torn western region of Darfur, though diplomatic pressure from the US and other countries is mounting.

 The largest number of Indian troops is currently in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where a brigade-plus force of four battalions and a contingent of the Indian Air Force are mandated to use force if required to keep peace. 

 Southern Sudan has the second-largest Indian contingent, but unlike Congo, the UN resolution under Chapter VI of the charter mandates peacekeeping and not peace enforcement.

 Malhan said the President would address nearly 3,000 troops to be deployed in Congo and Sudan on rotation. 

 But the Indian deployment under the United Nations Mission for Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) would be scaled down by about 300 troops. 

 The UN department of peacekeeping operations informed the Indian Army yesterday that the mandate for the UNMEE was being extended by six months till July.

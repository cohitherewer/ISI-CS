 Prayer row

 Bhopal, Jan. 24: Jabalpur High Court dealt a blow to the BJP regime today when it ruled that participation in mass surya namaskar should be voluntary for students.

 Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, however, said his government would go ahead with the controversial programme tomorrow, which is expected to be attended by over three lakh school and college students.

 Muslim and Christian organisations, while welcoming the high courts interim order, said they would organise a protest in Bhopal at 11 am to coincide with the official launch of the programme in the state capital.

 State education minister Narottam Mishra said participation in the programme was voluntary, but that isnt what his ministrys communication sent to all schools and colleges mentioned.

 The missive threatened disciplinary action against students playing truant. When this was shown to Mishra, he brushed it off as routine wording. Otherwise, no one would show up, the minister said.

 In the high court today, state advocate-general Rabinandan Singh claimed that the circular issued on January 18 had made it clear that the surya namaskar programme would be voluntary and not mandatory.

 A division bench of Chief Justice A.K. Patnaik and Justice R.S. Jha, hearing a petition filed by some Muslim organisations, passed an interim order that only those who want to should attend the programme.

 Arguing on behalf of the petitioners the Jamait Ulema-e-Hind and the Bharatiya Muslim Sangh their counsel contended that recital of mantras during the programme would hurt the religious feelings of minorities. Saying the programme was against the spirit of the Constitution, they alleged that it was aimed at promoting saffron ideology. 

 The bench told the state government that no individual or institution must be forced to take part in the programme. It also issued a notice asking the government to reply within four weeks to the petitioners arguments.

 In Delhi, Chauhan said surya namaskar was part of his governments health for all programme. He added that soon a yoga policy would be launched. His government has sought the services of Baba Ramdev to promote yoga in the state. 

 The surya namaskar protest saw Christian organisations joining hands with Muslim and secular groups. 

 The Catholic Church in Bhopal has announced that it will boycott the Hindu religious practice. Archbishop Pascal Topno has instructed all missionary schools in Madhya Pradesh not to send their students to the programme. 

 Why should we send them there? I think it is clearly a Hindu practice, and definitely not secular, and it should not be imposed on other communities. We are one with the Muslim community on this issue, the archbishop said.

 The spokesperson of the Madhya Pradesh Bishops Council, Father Anand Muttungal, echoed him. We welcome the high court order. The governments move was aimed at dividing the community on the basis of religion, and even the children would have been affected by this, he said.

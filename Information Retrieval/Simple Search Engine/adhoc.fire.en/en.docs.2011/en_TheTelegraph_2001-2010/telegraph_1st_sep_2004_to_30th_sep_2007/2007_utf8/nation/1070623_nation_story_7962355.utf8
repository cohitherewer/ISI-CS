 Centre lines up 30 new varsities

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 22: The Centre plans to set up and fund 30 universities across the country to reduce the burden on existing centrally funded institutions and raise the standard of higher education in India, the Prime Minister announced today. 

 Unveiling the latest chapter of his pet project transforming India into a knowledge economy Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said work on the new central universities would begin within two to three months. 

 Work on the modalities for setting these (universities) up has begun, and the ministry of human resource development, University Grants Commission and the Planning Commission are working to operationalise this in the next two-three months, Singh said in his address at the 150th anniversary of the University of Mumbai. 

 Only 10 per cent children who complete secondary education go for higher studies way behind the 40-50 per cent figure put out by developed countries. The government was targeting raising the Indian figure to 15 per cent over the course of the 11th five-year plan, Singh said. 

 HRD ministry sources said the locations for the new universities have not yet been finalised. 

 India has 20 central universities 18 are funded by the UGC but these are all spread over just nine states, Delhi and Puducherry. 

 The remaining 19 states of India, UGC sources said, would receive first priority in getting central universities. 

 Tamil Nadu which does not have a central university but has considerable clout with the current government is likely to be the first in the assembly line.

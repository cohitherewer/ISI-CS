 Bengal to enforce Hilsa ban

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Weighty matter

 Calcutta, June 4: The Bengal government today promised to enforce strictly the three-year-old ban on the sale or fishing of hilsa weighing less than 500 grams.

 Fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda said officials of his department would carry out random raids on markets and seize all hilsa lighter than half a kilo.

 The government has called a meeting tomorrow at Writers Buildings and summoned all associations representing fishermen, wholesalers and markets, including the major hilsa-selling ones in Diamond Harbour, Digha, Namkhana, Petoaghat, Geonkhali, Howrah and Sealdah.

 We will remind them of the ban and tell them that this time we shall take strong action against violators, a fisheries department official said.

 Nanda said 16 awareness camps would be held for fishermen in East Midnapore and North and South 24-Parganas. The sabhadhipatis of the three districts will be present at tomorrows meeting.

 Weve been warning fishermen for the last three years; now we mean business, Nanda said.

 Indiscriminate netting of young hilsa has led to two species the mukhpora ilish and chandana ilish becoming virtually extinct, the minister said. The quantity of hilsa available in rivers such as the Ganga and Rupnarayan, too, has fallen. The fisheries department officials said four years ago, the states annual hilsa catch was 24,000 tonnes. Last year, it was 20,000 tonnes.

 Nanda explained that this was happening because fishermen were catching young hilsa before the fish could spawn. This had also affected the biodiversity in Bengals rivers. 

 When the ban was imposed, the government had asked fishermen to release any hilsa they caught below the stipulated weight. But no one paid heed. Bangladesh has enforced the ban strictly and got very good results, Nanda said.

 Katara probe glare on BJP

 OUR BUREAU 

 New Delhi/ Ahmedabad, April 20: A Delhi police team will question BJP leaders and workers close to Babubhai Katara in Gujarat when the trafficking-tainted MP is taken there next week, police sources said today.

 Katara is believed to have named five in the partys Gujarat unit who helped him send people abroad illegally. But officials, anxious to ward off accusations of a witch-hunt from the BJP, arent ready to disclose their identities.

 At least five names have come out in his interrogation. All are close to him. While he has told us that their role in the racket (trafficking) was limited, we will carry out our own probe when we visit the state, a senior official in the investigating team said.

 The investigators reckon that a public personality like Katara couldnt have been alone in such a racket, which must have been at least known to others.

 We believe several BJP leaders in Gujarat would have known about his activities. But they did nothing to stop him, or inform law enforcement agencies. That makes them liable to criminal charges as well, an official said.

 A three-member team another will travel with Katara reached his constituency Dahod today to look for family members but drew a blank.

 His residence in Jhalod and his ancestral home in Chitrodia village were locked. Neighbours couldnt say where the MPs wife, Shardaben, and his two sons, Bhavesh and Amit, were.

 The familys lockers have been seized and transactions made by the Kataras and Rajinder, the MPs secretary, from bank accounts in Jhalod are being scanned.

 The family members appear to be absconding for fear of arrest which makes them, and their role in the racket, suspicious, deputy commissioner of police (crime branch) Neeraj Thakur told The Telegraph.

 The police are also finding out if Katara had links with officials in the immigration department and the foreign ministry.

 Thakur revealed that parents of the boy Katara was taking with him on his sons passport live in Toronto.

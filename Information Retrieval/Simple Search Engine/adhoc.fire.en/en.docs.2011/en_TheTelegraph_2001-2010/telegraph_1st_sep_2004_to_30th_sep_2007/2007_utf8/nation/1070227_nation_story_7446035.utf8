 Target airlines calm till trains learn to fly

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Feb. 26: Lalu Prasad is hoping to hijack plane passengers but low-cost airlines say trains will have to learn to fly first to beat them.

 That is what the railways are hoping to pull off sometime in the future with trains travelling at 300-350 km an hour in dedicated high-speed corridors.

 The railway minister has for the first time introduced the concept of peak season and lean season fares for train travel, a tactic airlines have been routinely using.

 Lalu Prasad, who had last year tried to take on the low-cost carriers by lowering fares in the first and second air-conditioned classes, besides offering upgrades, hopes this years round of cuts and variable fares would help bust competition. 

 But airlines said they are unperturbed. Ajay Singh, director of SpiceJet, said: We dont think we will lose out. If the railways have dropped fares, it goes to prove we are on the right track. We think we will continue getting more and more passengers because trains just cant fly. 

 Singhs point is that middle-class India is no longer bothered about a few thousand rupees but places a premium on speed of travel as lifestyles and demands of work have changed. 

 The cuts announced by the rail minister will stimulate more travel and, frankly, the shift that will happen will be from AC three-tier to AC second or first class, not from us, Singh added.

 The fare baskets offered by airlines still remain attractive. Flight costs between Delhi and Calcutta or Mumbai start from about Rs 1,500 and can go up to about Rs 6,000. Second AC Rajdhani fares between the capital and the eastern megapolis stand at about Rs 1,900-2,000, while first AC costs nearly Rs 3,500. 

 Air Deccan chief G.R. Gopinath said: The numbers are huge but it would not impact low-cost air travel. We will not revise our fares as almost all our rates are below first and second class AC.

 But the railways are also planning high-speed passenger corridors with trains running at 300-350 km. Lalu Prasad today said the railways would conduct pre-feasibility studies for high-speed corridors in the northern, western, southern and eastern sectors. 

 If and when this comes about, the airlines will face some rough weather. The maximum operative speed of Indian trains now swings between 100 and 120 km an hour.

 Railway board chairman J.P. Batra said: Empirical evidence abroad has shown that high-speed trains are the preferred mode of travel for distances between 500 and 1,000 km. Once the high-speed service started between Paris and Lyons, all flights on that route had to be withdrawn.

 Ram snags Indias Suez

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Feb. 24: Indias most ambitious navigation project suddenly faces a hurdle from Lord Ram.

 A Tamil Nadu court has asked the Centre to investigate if a chain of islets, being dredged out under the Rs 2,427-crore Sethusamudram Ship Canal Project, is indeed the mythological bridge built by Rams army of monkeys.

 The so-called Adams Bridge a series of sand-dune islets and shallows linking India and Sri Lanka southeast of Dhanushkodi near Rameshwaram is locally believed to be the bridge Ram built to invade Lanka and rescue Sita.

 Its to be dredged out completely to open up a direct route between the Indian east and west coasts, removing the need for ships to sail round Sri Lanka.

 But yesterday, a judge of the Ramanathapuram sub-court asked Delhi to form an experts committee, including geologists and archaeologists, to verify claims that Adams Bridge is nothing less than Rams bridge.

 The judge, Mohammed Abudahir, however, declined to order an interim stay on the dredging and fixed the next hearing for March 5.

 The two petitioners, advocate Kuppu Ram and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh functionary Swami Omkarananda, want the project stalled.

 The Centres counsel has told the court that the governments survey did not reveal any artificial bridge under the shallow seawaters. But the petitioners have claimed that satellite pictures taken by US space agency Nasa show an undersea, ancient bridge-like structure in the region.

 They have quoted certain scientists who believe the structure is man-made, and furnished centuries-old historical documents that make a similar claim.

 Other than the Adams Bridge islets, the shallows of the Palk Bay are to be dredged out under the project, which aims to create a 167-km channel, dubbed the Suez of the East, connecting the Palk Strait to the Bay of Bengal.

 The channel will shorten shipping routes by up to 424 nautical miles (780 km) and sailing time by some 30 hours, saving fuel. Indias import-export trade will save the Rs 1,000 crore a year it now spends in foreign exchange owing to transhipment of cargo outside the country, through Colombo.

 However, the dredging of Adams Bridge, which began a few months ago, has been stalled by a series of accidents.

 First, the dredging vessel Duck-6 sank in the sea. It was replaced by the Dredging Corporation of Indias biggest dredging vessel, Aquarius, but its spud broke.

 The 150-tonne Thangam was sent to retrieve the spud but its giant crane snapped and crashed into the sea. With Aquarius under repairs at the Cochin shipyard, work has stopped.

 We believe that Hanuman is guarding the bridge, said Kuppu Ram over the phone from Ramanathapuram.

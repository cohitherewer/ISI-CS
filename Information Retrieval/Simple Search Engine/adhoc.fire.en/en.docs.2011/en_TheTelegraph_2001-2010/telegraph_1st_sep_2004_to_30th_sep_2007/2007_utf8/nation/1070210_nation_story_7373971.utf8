 J amp;K moves a step closer to Shariat

 Jammu, Feb. 9: The Shariat will come into force in Jammu and Kashmir, like the rest of India.

 The Assembly this evening passed a bill that makes Muslim Personal Law applicable in the state. So far, Muslims in the state were governed by a mix of local customs and components of the personal law in force in the rest of the country.

 The cases in the civil courts would take years and cost a fortune. This was a lengthy, difficult and expensive process for poor Muslims in the state. To save their time and money, these changes were necessary, said National Conference leader Abdul Rahim Rather who tabled the private bill.

 Once the bill becomes an Act it now has to go to the Upper House and then the governor for approval laws governing inheritance, succession, marriage and adoption among Kashmiri Muslims will be aligned with the rest of the country.

 This law would now enable them (Muslims) to get their matters settled in Shariat courts, Rather said.

 Hindus in Kashmir are governed by a separate law.

 Although Jammu and Kashmir is the only Muslim-majority state in the country, it does not have Shariat courts like elsewhere because Article 370 bars automatic extension of Indian laws to the state. 

 The Jammu and Kashmir legislature makes its own civil and criminal laws. In the rest of the country, Muslims are governed by the Indian Shariat Act of 1937. 

 Although the bill was brought by an Opposition MLA, the government did not oppose it. Consumer affairs and animal husbandry minister Taj Mohi-ud-Din, who was substituting for law minister Tariq Hameed Karra, said the law ministry has no problem with the bill being passed. Speaker Tara Chand then put it to vote.

 Probe promise

 Bowing to Opposition pressure, the Jammu and Kashmir government today announced that it would probe all cases of custodial disappearances and human rights violation in the state since 1990.

 Amid adjournment and disruptions by the Opposition National Conference, chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad told the House: If you feel so, we will order probe. Ways and means will be seen.

 Azad said the states intentions should not be suspected. Our intentions are clear, that is why we have put police officers behind bars.

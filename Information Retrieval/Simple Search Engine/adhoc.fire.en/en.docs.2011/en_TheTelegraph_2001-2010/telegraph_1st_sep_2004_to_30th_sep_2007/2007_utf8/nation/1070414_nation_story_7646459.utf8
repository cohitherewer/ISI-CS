 Snub to contempt minister 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Thiruvananthapuram, April 13: Kerala High Court has rejected an apology by local self-government minister Paloli Mohammadkutty in a contempt case.

 Acting Chief Justice K.S. Radhakrishnan and Justice M.N. Krishnan said the ministers apology was not sincere and he had not admitted his guilt. They said his remarks suggesting corruption in a section of the judiciary would have long-term repercussions. The case will be heard again on May 30.

 The minister said the decision did not surprise him. I will not quit. I am ready to go to jail if it comes to that since its not for corruption or sexual misdemeanours. Let the court come to its final conclusion.

 CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan ruled out Mohammadkuttys resignation, citing the case of late chief minister E.M.S. Namboodiripad who remained in office and appealed to the Supreme Court against a high court conviction for contempt.

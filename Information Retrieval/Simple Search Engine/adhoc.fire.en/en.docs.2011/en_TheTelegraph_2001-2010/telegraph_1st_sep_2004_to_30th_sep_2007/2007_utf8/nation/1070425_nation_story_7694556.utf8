 Graduate criminals take UP stage

 DHIRENDRA K. JHA

 New Delhi, April 24: Highly literate criminals in the politics of Uttar Pradesh are set to push their illiterate counterparts into a minority.

 Candidates facing criminal charges have long been a part of state politics, but as the fifth phase of polls approaches, the spotlight has shifted to this new group of contenders.

 An independent election monitoring organisation has found that in this phase, graduates or post-graduates account for more than half the total candidates with criminal cases against them.

 The elections, to be held on April 28, will cover 58 constituencies. There are 863 candidates in the fray, of whom 115 have criminal cases pending against them.

 According to Uttar Pradesh Election Watch, 58 of these 115 are either graduates or postgraduates with professional degrees. Its findings are based on the analysis of affidavits submitted by candidates along with their nomination papers.

 The number shoots up when the combined average for all five phases are counted 65 per cent of the candidates fielded by mainstream political parties are graduates or postgraduates.

 In this phase, the Bahujan Samaj Party, at 45 per cent, tops the list of candidates with pending criminal cases, followed by the ruling Samajwadi Party at 37 per cent. But the positions are interchanged if all five phases are taken into account Mulayam Singh Yadavs party at 34 per cent beats rival Mayavatis BSP, 32 per cent.

 The BJP with 25 per cent is in third place for the April 28 polls, the findings revealed. The Congress lags at 12 per cent. The two retain their positions when all five phases are counted nearly 28 per cent of the BJPs candidates have criminal cases pending against them; the Congress with 20 per cent has a better report card.

 Slight flutter at Andaman yacht parade

 SUJAN DUTTA 

 New destination

 Port Blair, March 23: A dramatic rise in the number of pleasure boats yachts of the rich that have docked in the Andamans since January and the imminence of an oil strike have pushed the unified command of the armed forces here into higher gear. 

 Defence minister A.K. Antony arrives here tomorrow for a three-day tour of the archipelago in the Bay of Bengal during which he will be told of concerns and future prospects because all the action is going to start here soon, the commander-in-chief of the Andaman and Nicobar Command, Air Marshal P.P. Raj Kumar, said today. 

 A total of 69 yachts have docked in Port Blair between January 1 and March 23 this year already seven more than the number recorded in all of 2006. 

 For the district administration and for the ANC Command, this rise is a happy post-tsunami fallout. Since the tsunami of December 2004, this place has got wide publicity, said Air Marshal Raj Kumar. 

 Last year, a leading German tourism agency ranked a beach in the Cinque Island, about 25 km south of Port Blair, among the worlds best. Enquiries have followed. 

 According to records of the yachts that register with the port trust before berthing and the records are monitored by the naval component of the unified command most of the pleasure boats are from Singapore and Malaysia from where they are hired. 

 But the rich tourists are mostly from the West. British and Israeli travellers top the list. 

 Last year, the Andamans also recorded the largest number of domestic tourists around 1.4 lakh but they were typically not high spenders. 

 The arrival of foreign yachts in such large number is also of concern to the navy and the unified command not only because it is a departure from the pattern but also because foreign vessels are now being licensed to explore in two offshore blocks of the Oil and Natural Gas Commission. 

 Till about five years ago, Indian authorities used to voice concern on Chinese presence in the Bay of Bengal islands, particularly in Myanmars Cocos Islands, where Beijing was reported to have set up a listening post. But now the unified command is satisfied that Cocos , about 40 km from the tip of the North Andamans, is not a threat. 

 The licensing of foreign ships for exploration in the Andamans is also done on military advice to the Union ministry of petroleum and natural gas. The navys Flag Officer Defence Advisory Group is consulted on each case. 

 But the unified command has now been given to understand that the likelihood of a gas strike in blocks IV and V under the foreign licensing scheme is very high. That will change the entire nature of the unified commands operations, senior ANC command sources say. 

 We will have to think, for instance, of connections to the mainland, of pipelines, said Air Marshal Raj Kumar.

 Red run: 7 to 16 states in two years

 MANAN KUMAR

New Delhi, May 22: The Maoists have widened their network threefold in the past two years, spreading to 183 districts across 16 states, the Centre believes.

 Over the past year, the rebels have forayed into seven new states, a home ministry report says.

 The ministry lists Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi as the states where the Maoists have established new bases by setting up regional and district-level centres.

 Keralas inclusion is surprising, because the Naxalites are known to have had a presence in the state for many years now.

 In 2005, the Centre had estimated a Maoist presence in 55 districts spread across just seven states.

 The worry is that the plan to extend their area of activity is working perfectly. It could become impossible to contain them once they decide to strike at many places suddenly, a senior home ministry official said.

 The strength of the armed Maoist cadre, too, has risen from 8,000 in 2005 and 11,000 in 2006 to 15,000 in 2007.

 Almost 90 per cent of the armed cadre strength is drawn from the erstwhile Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) and the Peoples War Group (PWG). The rest comes from 34 other organisations, the official said.

 These other groups are playing a crucial role in setting up the bases and enlisting new cadres in the new areas.

 The Naxalites focus on issues relating to Dalits, minorities, tribals and women to widen their base.

 They campaign among these sections, explaining to them how they are exploited by the administration and society. Slowly, they whip up their passions against the exploitative state, the official said.

 They then recruit the committed ones as regular cadres and set up bases.

 The ministry report, released in April, however, claims only marginal increase in Maoist attacks.

 It says Naxalite violence actually went down from a high of 1,608 in 2005 to 1,509 in 2006, although the number of police personnel killed went up slightly, from 153 in 2005 to 157 in 2006.

 (This is because) violence is not the Maoists immediate aim. They take it up as the last resort when their hegemony in an established area, such as Chhattisgarh, is challenged, the official said.

 He added that the government is yet to work out a plan to counter the growth of Maoism in the new areas.

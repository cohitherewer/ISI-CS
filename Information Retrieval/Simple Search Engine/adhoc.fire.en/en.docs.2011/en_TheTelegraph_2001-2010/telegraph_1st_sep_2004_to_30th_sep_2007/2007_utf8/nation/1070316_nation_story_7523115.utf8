 Calcutta, March 15: Tata Motors has said that work on its plant has been much faster in Uttarakhand, and suggested that it would have liked similar progress in Bengal.

 There is an opportunity before Bengal, too. It is up to the state and its people to decide, managing director Ravi Kant said today. 

 The company is setting up a unit in Uttarakhand that will roll out 250,000 small trucks every year. Its small car plant in Singur will have a similar capacity.

 Kant said neither state had any auto industry to speak of till the Tatas decided to invest in new projects. 

 A year ago, there was nothing in Uttarakhand. Today, a project exactly the size of Singur has come up. There are 600 acres for the mother plant and 350 acres for ancillary units. Quietly, everything has happened no talk, no media attention, Kant told an auto dealers seminar here.

 The ancillary units have helped create an auto cluster, drawing other auto industries to the Uttarakhand site. I wish the same had happened here. But whatever has happened, I dont want to go into it, he said, alluding to the protests over land acquisition in Singur.

 Tata Motors, he said, has come forward against great risks and high odds to set up its plant in Bengal. 

 It is for the people to decide what is required. We are committed to participating in the industrialisation drive of Bengal.

 Kant said work at Singur is going on well and the small cars will roll out by the middle of next year. The Uttarakhand unit, built in 11 months only, will begin production soon.

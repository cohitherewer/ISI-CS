The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Basu fingers crossed

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Calcutta, Sept. 29: Jyoti Basu today said a section of the CPM was hopeful a compromise could emerge if the Congress accommodated some Left demands on the nuclear deal.

 After the first session of the CPM central committee meeting, he said a decision had yet to be taken to withdraw support to the UPA.

 This is being taken to mean that the issue of withdrawal of support would be kept hanging till the third week of October.

 No decision has been taken to withdraw support yet. Our decision would depend on the outcome of two meetings of the Left-UPA joint mechanism on the nuke deal on October 5 and 14. I hope the government accepts our demands. If it refuses to budge, we will take appropriate steps, Basu was quoted as saying by his aides.

 The politburo was unanimous with regard to the steps taken by the party on the nuclear deal. The CC members who have spoken so far also agreed with that.

 There was some confusion about Basus remarks in the evening as he was leaving the party headquarters. The impression was he had said the politburo was unanimous about pulling the rug if the UPA refused to accept the Lefts proposals.

 We are also discussing how the government is violating the common minimum programme and what to do if there is an election ahead, Basu said.

 Later, party sources clarified he had not said anything to indicate that the politburo or the central committee had taken such a stand.

 Mounting what looked like a damage-control exercise, an aide and a party official said all options would be explored before the Left decided to snap ties with the Congress.

 Basus words, however, suggested he had conceded some ground to CPM general secretary Prakash Karat who wants the party to send a no-nonsense ultimatum to the Congress.

 Asked if the party was gearing for a showdown, Basu said: It cant be said that way now. We cant compromise on the nuclear issue. Pranabbabu (foreign minister) called me up and asked about our position. I told him we would decide after knowing the Congress decision. I asked him to talk to us after he comes back (from New York).

 The Left leaders refused to commit themselves either way. Let us see what concessions Pranabbabu is able to extract. We are ready to wait as long as the government does not operationalise the nuke deal, said central committee member Mohammad Salim.

 The IAEA discussion would be the first step to operationalising the 123 Agreement. As soon as the government opens talks on India-specific safeguards by October end, we will have to decide about withdrawal of support, said central secretariat member Nilotpal Basu.

 A CPM leader said the Left wanted the UPA to ensure reciprocity of interests over the nuke deal. At least that will redeem the Prime Ministers pledges in July 2005 and August 2006.

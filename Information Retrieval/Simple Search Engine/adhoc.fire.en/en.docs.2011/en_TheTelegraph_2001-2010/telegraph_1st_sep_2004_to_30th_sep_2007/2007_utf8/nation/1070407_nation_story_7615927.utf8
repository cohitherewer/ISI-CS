 Thorns for Bengal in SEZ rules

 - State party fears fallout on industrialisation drive, amendment to land ceiling bill

 Calcutta, April 6: The Bengal CPM has woken up to the pitfalls in the new guidelines that will govern land acquisition for special economic zones.

 The Bengal unit is worried that the Centres move to restrict state governments role in land purchase for SEZs will make more difficult the partys efforts to turn allies around on a crucial land ceiling bill.

 Without amending the bill, no SEZ can come up in Bengal as the law part of the Left Fronts land reforms package restricts holdings to 24 acres in rural areas. Only mills, factories and tea gardens are exempt.

 An amendment bill to ease the restriction had run into resistance from the allies and is now stuck in a House panel. The issue will come up at tomorrows Left Front meeting.

 The SEZ policy announced yesterday had said state governments cannot forcibly acquire land for the zones. This means the land acquisition act, a handy tool that allowed the state government to take over property even if the owner did not give consent, has become irrelevant as far as SEZs are concerned and the promoters will have to buy land directly.

 The CPM leadership feels that since the new policy virtually shuts the government out of land deals, which will now be struck by private investors, the allies will step up their pitch against amending the bill. 

 The bill is crucial not only for SEZs but also for infrastructure projects that will need land.

 The state CPM also fears that though yesterdays guidelines deal only with SEZs, land acquisition by the government for any industry could now come under the glare as the policy has helped create an impression that such takeover is not a desirable practice.

 Asked whether industrialisation would be affected, Jyoti Basu said after the partys weekly state secretariat meeting: Yes, we will face some problems. We are discussing it and would take up the issues with the Centre. 

 The CPM feels that private investors will find it impossible to acquire large tracts in the state where holdings are fragmented.

 In Singur (where a car plant, not an SEZ, is coming up), the government had to deal with more than 12,000 farmers. Despite the hiccups, the process of land acquisition was fast. How can you expect a corporate group to negotiate with such a large number of small landholders to buy land directly for industry? Its cumbersome and time-consuming, said CPM leader Benoy Konar.

 After Nandigram, the state has allowed three steel plants to buy some land directly but industries minister Nirupam Sen has insisted that the state has a right to acquire land in larger public interest. It (the states right to acquire land) is needed both to ensure planned development as well as to protect poor farmers from land speculators, he said.

 The Forward Bloc also demanded the restoration of the states right to acquire land for SEZs.

 Woman cops smut case falls through

 New Delhi, Jan. 1 (PTI): Two persons accused of blackmailing a Delhi policewoman by taking obscene photographs of her have been acquitted by a court as it found the victims testimony doubtful.

 The womans testimony seems doubtful in view of the fact that even on November 30, 1998, the day her alleged obscene photographs were taken, she was found to be neither on leave nor absent from duty, the judge said in his order.

 It was incumbent upon the prosecution to prove this important aspect, he said, while acquitting Badri Nath Sahni and Nirmala Devi of charges under various sections of the Indian Penal Code.

 According to the prosecution, on the morning of November 30, 1998, Sahni allegedly took the woman constable to a house in Adarsh Nagar where she was offered sedative-laced tea. The policewoman claimed she remained unconscious till evening and was later admitted to a nursing home for two days.

 The prosecution also could not produce any medical record of the victims treatment in the nursing home in west Delhi, the judge pointed out.

 According to the prosecution, the policewoman who had worked with Sahni before joining Delhi police in 1996, approached him for filling up a form. Later, she came to know that Sahni and Nirmala had taken obscene photographs of her and they started blackmailing her.

 Sahni and Nirmala were arrested after registration of a case on March 22, 1999. The police are said to have found five photographs and a camera, besides other materials, from the possession of the accused. 

 The court said: For reasons best known to the investigating officer, he did not prefer to send the photos and the camera to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory for obtaining opinion whether those were taken with the camera or not.

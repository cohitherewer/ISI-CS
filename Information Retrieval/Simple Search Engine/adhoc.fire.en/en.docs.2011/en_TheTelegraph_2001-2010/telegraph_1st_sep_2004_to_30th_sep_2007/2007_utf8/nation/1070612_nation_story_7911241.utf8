 Buzz in Big Cities 

 Get smart, get a Metro discount

 It pays to be smart. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is planning to give a 10 per cent discount per trip to all smart card users.

 Most daily commuters use the smart card as it works out cheaper. We want to encourage frequent travellers to purchase the smart cards. Hence, the move, Anuj Dayal, a spokesperson for the DMRC, said. 

 A fortnightly smart card currently costs Rs 100, the monthly Rs 200 and an annual card comes at Rs 700.

 Those who already have smart cards will be charged 10 per cent less on every trip, so their cards will run longer than the stipulated period, Dayal said. 

 Tickets per trip currently range from Rs 6 to 14, depending on the distance.

 Stalins school secret

 M.K. Stalin might have raised quite a few eyebrows because of his unusual name. But it once cost him a place in a school that, too, Jayalalithaas.

 The younger son of DMK boss M. Karunanidhi recently spilled this childhood secret at a wedding. 

 Stalins family had first wanted to name him Ayyathurai combining the names of Periyar, the late Dravidian social reformer, and DMK founder Annadurai.

 That would have made him Periyar and Annadurai rolled into one. But that was not to be. 

 Stalin was born on March 1, 1953, soon after Joseph Stalin had died. And Karunanidhi decided to pay tribute to the Russian communist leader through his son. 

 When the time came to put little Stalin in school, his uncle Murasoli Maran took him to Chennais Church Park Convent. 

 But the school authorities said he could get admission only if he got a different name. They couldnt risk a little dictator in school. 

 Maran conveyed this to Karunanidhi, but the DMK leader refused to change his sons name. So, Stalin changed his school. 

 But it seems it was a blessing in disguise, or else I would have had to study in a school that nurtured Jayalalithaa, the DMK scion shuddered. 

 Ticket to a cosmetic ride

 How about some toiletries with a ticket to ride? Its no joke. Your load could soon be lighter when youre travelling by Central Railway. 

 If the railway authorities have their way, train tickets will come with free sachets of shampoo and bodycare products. 

 But there is a slight problem. The booking clerks supposed to distribute the freebies have opposed the move, saying it would be too time-consuming.

 A cosmetics company is said to have tied up with Central Railway for advertising space on the back of tickets. The company also wants to distribute its products along with tickets for first class, AC two-tier and AC three-tier, as part of its promotional strategy.

 Railway officials, however, said an agreement with the company was yet to be finalised, but they were considering the proposal.

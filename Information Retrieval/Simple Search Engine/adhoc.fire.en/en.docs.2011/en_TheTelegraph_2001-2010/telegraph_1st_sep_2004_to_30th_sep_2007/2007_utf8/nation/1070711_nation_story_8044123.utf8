 Maya targets stadium

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, July 10: When it comes to toning up her Dalit image, nothing stands in the way for Mayavati not even a thriving stadium.

 The Uttar Pradesh chief minister last night sent police to evict inmates of a sprawling city sports complex so that it could be converted into a literary centre named after her mentor Kanshi Ram, the architect of Dalit politics in the state.

 Ironically, Mayavati had herself opened the stadium in 1994. But Kanshi Ram was alive then and the idea of a memorial to him was far from her mind.

 Sports officials and the stadiums inmates, however, got a respite this morning when the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court stayed the move till July 18. Sources said the state government is planning to contest the order.

 The Kanshi Ram Literary Centre is the latest of Mayavatis pet projects that include Dalit landmarks like the Ambedkar Memorial Park, the Parivartan Chowk in the heart of the city and the Ambedkar Maidan, a rally ground on its outskirts.

 She also built a museum of Dalit icons where both her and Kanshi Rams life-size idols have been installed.

 Around 8.30 last night, about 20 officers raided the Gomtinagar stadium that houses sports infrastructure worth Rs 20 crore, including six tennis courts, two badminton courts, a swimming pool and a sprawling outfield where budding cricketers can practise. The stadium can also accommodate 40 students of the state cricket academy.

 When the officers walked into the rooms last night, 25 resident trainee cricketers were having dinner. They were told to leave and their belongings were thrown out. Resident trainers and officials were asked to remove furniture. An hour later, computers, suitcases, books lay on the road.

 When we asked where we will go in the night, we were told to stay in the rooms and leave early in the morning, said Abhijit Mishra, a trainee cricketer. 

 Outside, policemen kept watch, just in case the residents protested. SSP S. Jagdanand said the police were told to ensure that the inmates offered no resistance.

 The move has come less than two months after Mayavati took over as chief minister for the fourth time. 

 She told us that since the stadium was close to the Ambedkar Memorial Park, it would be an appropriate place for the Kanshi Ram Literary Centre to come up, said an officer who didnt want to be named.

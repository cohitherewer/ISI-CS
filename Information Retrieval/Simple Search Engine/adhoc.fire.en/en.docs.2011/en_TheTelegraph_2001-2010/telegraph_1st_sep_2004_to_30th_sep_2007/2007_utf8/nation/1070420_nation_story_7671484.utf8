 Sanjaya voted off Idol

 Sanjaya Malakar

 New York, April 19 (AP): In his improbable run on American Idol, Sanjaya Malakar was the one to watch.

 The string-bean teen with the megawatt smile worked his strange magic on the shows stage week after week, captivating millions and horrifying Simon Cowell, his loudest critic.

 Did Malakar lack talent? For sure. Was he boring? Not by a long shot.

 His reign of goofy charm finally ended last night, when he was voted off the top-rated Fox sing-off. When the result was announced, Malakar wiped away tears and got a big hug from LaKisha Jones, the next lowest vote-getter.

 Im fine, he told host Ryan Seacrest. It was an amazing experience. 

 I can promise you: We wont soon forget you, Seacrest replied.

 Malakar then performed one last song, Something To Talk About. Putting his own twist to the song, the 17-year-old known for his pretty looks and ever-changing hairstyles ad-libbed: Lets give them something to talk about... other than hair.

 On Tuesday nights show, Cowell had slammed his performance as utterly horrendous. And for once, the notoriously mean judge was vindicated. Im beginning to sense something here, a grinning Cowell said when Malakar wound up in the bottom three.

 Six contestants are now left: Jones, Blake Lewis, Jordin Sparks, Chris Richardson, Melinda Doolittle and Phil Stacey.

 Malakar was routinely savaged by Cowell as he developed into one of the weakest, most awkward Idol finalists ever. Still, the gangly teen managed to outlast better singers by cultivating an unlikely fan base that helped him survive round after round of viewer elimination.

 Although his breathy, childlike singing voice paled in comparison with other finalists, his ability to stand out kept him in the competition.

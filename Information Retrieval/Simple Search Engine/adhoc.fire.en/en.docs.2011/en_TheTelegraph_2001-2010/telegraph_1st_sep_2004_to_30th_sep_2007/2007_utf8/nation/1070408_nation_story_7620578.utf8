 New Delhi, April 7: The BJP today swept the civic polls in the capital just about a year before the Assembly elections, kicking off a blame game between the Delhi Congress and embattled chief minister Sheila Dikshit.

 A jubilant BJP, which has already wrested Punjab and Uttarakhand from the Congress, saw the victory as a stepping stone to recapturing the Delhi Assembly for the first time since 1998.

 The Uttar Pradesh elections, which also started today, werent far from Delhi BJP chief Harshavardhans mind, either.

 After Punjab and Uttarakhand, we will win Uttar Pradesh, too. Gujarat will remain ours later this year, and Delhi the next. People are voting in waves against the Congresss arrogance, he said.

 The defeat completes back-to-back disappointments for the Congress in metropolises after the party and its partner, the Nationalist Congress Party, failed to wrest Mumbai from the Shiv Sena-BJP.

 Soon after the results showed that the BJP had won 165 of the Municipal Corporation of Delhis 272 wards to the Congresss 65, Dikshit pointed a finger at the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee, headed by her arch-rival Ram Babu Sharma.

 The committee had not come up to expectations, she said, and called for introspection. Her loyalists accused Sharma and his group of working against the chief minister in some wards.

 Sharmas supporters hit back by accusing Dikshit of being more concerned about the chief ministers chair than the plight of Delhiites.

 Sharma himself blamed issues related to governance, including the sealing and demolition drives, water and power problems and rising prices.

 Dikshit agreed that the sealing of illegal commercial establishments was partly responsible for the rout.

 No government, neither us nor the BJP, would want to do things that go against the will of their electorate. We were bound by court orders, and the sealing turned people against the MCD, she said.

 The All India Congress Committee frowned at the infighting. 

 The party general secretary in charge of Delhi, Ashok Gehlot, said the results could have been somewhat better if Dikshit and Sharma had worked together.

 Harshavardhan appeared keen to stoke the power struggle in the Congress. He said the anti-people Dikshit government, and not so much the Congress, was to blame for the defeat.

 Sheila Dikshit should resign and someone else should take over as chief minister, he added. The chief minister dismissed the demand.

 The Bahujan Samaj Party, which doesnt have a single MLA in the Delhi Assembly, opened its account with a surprise 15 seats while former BJP chief minister Madan Lal Khuranas Bharatiya Janshakti Party won only two.

 The NCP, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and the Lok Janshakti Party won two seats each while Independents bagged 16.

 Voters verdict: no place for tainted

 Bhopal, March 11: The people of Gwalior and Sidhi appear to have followed the Supreme Courts suggestion to a T: hanged the corrupt from a lamppost.

 Three days after an apex court bench said this was the only pill to rid the country of graft, the two Madhya Pradesh seats from where cash-for-question MPs were expelled have voted out the parties to which they belong.

 The Congress was today shown the door in Gwalior, left vacant by the expulsion of its MP, Ram Sewak Gujjar, in 2005. Likewise, the BJP was booted out in Sidhi from where Chandra Pratap Singh was sacked. 

 This is the first round of elections to the seats that fell vacant after the cash-for-questions scandal erupted. Eleven MPs 10 from the Lok Sabha and one from the Rajya Sabha were thrown out after they were caught taking cash to raise questions in the House.

 Although the scandal may not be the only reason for todays bypoll blows, the peoples verdict is a striking one.

 No amount of cajoling and camping in Gwalior by Jyotiraditya Scindia could save the Congresss Ashok Singh, who was defeated by the BJPs Yashodhara Raje Scindia.

 In Sidhi, some 650 km away, Jyotiradityas rival Ajay Singh, son of HRD minister Arjun Singh, beamed as the Congresss Manik Singh defeated the BJPs Kunwar Singh.

 For Jyotiraditya, aunt Yashodharas victory is also a personal blow because the people have not bought his claim that he alone represents the erstwhile Gwalior rulers. 

 Supporters of the former maharaja of Gwalior conceded the defeat would have far-reaching consequences as the seat had fallen to another branch of the Scindia family.

 The Sidhi win shaped by Ajay has added to Jyotiradityas problems. As both are nursing ambitions to head the Madhya Pradesh Congress, todays win could pitch Ajay as a strong contender. Ajay had asked for a free hand to mastermind the Sidhi campaign like Jyotiraditya in Gwalior. Partymen were today heard praising Ajays political acumen and questioning Jyotiradityas.

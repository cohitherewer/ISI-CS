 Ranchi, March 18: Had Saturdays shocker been played out in Ranchi, there wouldnt have been many places for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to duck cricket fans.

 On other occasions, a scoreless dismissal would have led to prayers. Not today, when protests over Saturdays shocker were putting other Team India top guns in the firing line.

 The boundary wall of a house Dhoni is building was damaged. The structure, in the towns Harmu colony, is coming up on a plot gifted to the wicket-keeper by the Jharkhand government.

 Brick-and-mortar backlash over, it was time for effigies to be burnt. Slogans like pay attention to cricket instead of endorsing products rent the air once full of tales about Dhonis heave over the ropes. For once, it appeared as if the rear-guard warrior was on the ropes himself.

 Dhoni has no right to retain the plot. He should work either in advertisements or open a grocery shop, said district vice-president of the Jharkhand Yuva Morcha Arun Kumar. 

 But Narendra, the cricketers elder brother, was unruffled. We are safe. Such demonstrations take place when expectations arent fulfilled. We have taken it sportingly. Brother-in-law Gautam Kumar agreed: India hasnt lost the Cup. People should have patience. Security at the familys Shyamali home was stepped up. 

 Ranchi wasnt the only town seething. In Kanpur, effigies of Virender Sehwag were burnt. 

 In Jalandhar, protest marches against Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar didnt spare local boy Harbhajan. Allahabad, home to Mohammad Kaif, wanted their local lad to replace Sehwag. In Indore, players posters were beaten with shoes and chappals.

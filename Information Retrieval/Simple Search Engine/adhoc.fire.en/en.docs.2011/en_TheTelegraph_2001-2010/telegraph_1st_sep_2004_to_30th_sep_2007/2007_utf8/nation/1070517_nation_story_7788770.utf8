 Pranab fits Lefts bill

 OUR BUREAU

 Fair chance

 New Delhi, May 16: The presidential poll see-saw has tilted again, brightening Pranab Mukherjees chances if two ladies consent.

 The Left parties are warming to the prospect of the external affairs minister as the UPA nominee for the election in July.

 But the Congress will have to decide whether it can afford to spare Mukherjee, a trouble-shooter for the government as well as the party.

 Weighing against the expediency of Mukherjees enormous utility in politics and governance is a perception in the Congress that if it fails to grab the opportunity to install its candidate in the Rashtrapati Bhavan, it may not get another one in a long time.

 The Lefts reported choice yet to be made official virtually knocks Sushil Kumar Shinde out of the race. The power minister was the second name the Congress had proposed to CPI leader A.B. Bardhan. The last option, Karan Singh, was rejected from the start.

 Leaders of four Left parties met here this afternoon. Laying down the Left criteria for the nominee, CPM leader Prakash Karat said: We have decided the person should have a political stature, the requisite background and experience. This should be combined with an understanding of the Constitution. The candidate should know how to strike a balance between the executive, legislature and the judiciary. Above all, the candidate should be able to uphold secular credentials.

 Two persons Mukherjee and Somnath Chatterjee fit the standards set by the Left. The CPM has ruled out Chatterjees candidature. Besides, supporting Mukherjee may help the CPM keep the Congress from leaning towards Mamata Bannerjee.

 Karat said the Left has had consultations with the Congress and the UPA partners. He had also spoken to the Samajwadi Partys Amar Singh. The CPM leaders felt that the government should be able to finalise a name within a day or two.

 The BSP and the Samajwadi Party are still to make their stand clear. Ahmed Patel, Sonia Gandhis political secretary, is in touch with Satish C. Mishra, who was inducted into Mayavatis cabinet today and is considered the de facto deputy chief minister.

 Mishra is understood to have indicated the BSPs choice for a Brahmin, preferably from the heartland. Patel is likely to brief Mishra about the Lefts decision.

 The final decision is expected to be taken after a possible meeting between Mayavati and Sonia next week.

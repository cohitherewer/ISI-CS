 Johns Express stokes tempers

 Islamabad, Jan. 15 (PTI): Members of Pakistans Hazara community, who live on either side of the Afghan border, have called for the boycott of John Abraham-starrer Kabul Express for using derogatory language against them. 

 The Hazara community is offended by the derogatory language used in the film and demands its immediate ban, Ibrahim Hazara, secretary-general of the Hazara Democratic Party, was quoted by the Daily Times as saying today.

 We want the movie director to apologise to Hazaras of the world and urge the government of Pakistan to ban the movie and prevent it from being marketed in the country, Ibrahim said. 

 The movie not only makes an effort to defame the Hazara community but also creates a negative image of Pakistan and Afghanistan, he added.

 The members of the community, with an estimated population of around two lakhs, are Shia Muslims living mostly in Baluchistan.

 Ibrahim led a protest rally in front of the Quetta Press Club that was supported by the Hazara Students Federation.

 Quetta is home to a large number of Hazaras who fled from the Afghan semi-autonomous province of Hazarajat in the late 19th century due to the excesses of the then Afghan king, Abdur Rahman.

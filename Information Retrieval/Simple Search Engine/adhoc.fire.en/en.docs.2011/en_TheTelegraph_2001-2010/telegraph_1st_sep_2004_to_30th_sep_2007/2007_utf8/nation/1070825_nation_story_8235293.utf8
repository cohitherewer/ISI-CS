 Karat snarls, PM misses temple date

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The Sripuram temple

 Vellore, Aug. 24: Prakash Karat might have given Manmohan Singh reasons to pray more often but he has denied him the chance to visit a shrine modelled on the Golden Temple.

 The Prime Minister was to have graced Fridays inauguration of Sripuram, a Lakshmi temple in which nearly 56,000sqft of built-up area is draped in 24-carat gold.

 Spread over 100 acres at the forest-ringed Malaikodi village, 6km from here, the shrine has been built by Sri Sakthi Amma, a small-time godman with a faithful band of rich patrons and a web of foundations abroad, including some in the US, Singapore and Canada. They have been the source of the funds for the Rs 300-crore shrine that took six years and nearly 800 craftsmen to build. 

 There is no comparison with the Golden Temple at Amritsar. This is our dedication to the goddess. The aim is also to help change the hearts of people who will be drawn from all parts of the world, Sakthi Amma said, adding that Singh may find time to visit the shrine during concluding ceremonies a few weeks later.

 With so much gold, the security risk isnt a small one. Nearly 800 police personnel have been rushed to the temple, whose six-year construction was kept a low-key affair.

 Even the entry is not direct. Devotees have to take a long-winding tree-lined path to enter the main shrine. On the way, there are messages inscribed on the walls from the Vedas, the Bible, the Quran and Sakthi Amma himself.

 There is a lot of effort in appearing to be clean and above board. Every bit of gold has been accounted for. Nearly 1.5 tonnes of gold had been imported as bars with the Reserve Bank of Indias permission. The shipments were routed through Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation, the central agency through which sensitive items are purchased abroad, said Sunderrajan, a member of the temple trust.

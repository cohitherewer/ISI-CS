 Nuke experts happy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: The 123-Agreement covering Indo-US cooperation in civilian nuclear energy is the best possible agreement India could have got, two senior nuclear scientists said today, but cautioned that work remained to be done on certain issues. 

 The agreement will allow India to import natural uranium for its reactors and meet current uranium shortages. 

 Im reasonably satisfied. Under the given circumstances, I think this is the best possible agreement between India and the US, M.R. Srinivasan, former Atomic Energy Commission chairman, said. 

 He was among a group of retired scientists that had last year demanded that the deal should not interfere with the indigenous three-state programme and should not curtail indigenous research and development or the countrys nuclear weapons programme. 

 A non-hindrance clause has addressed this, Srinivasan said. 

 Its a good deal the best we could get, said Placid Rodriguez, former director of the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research. 

 But Srinivasan and Rodriguez said Article 6 suggested that work still needs to be done to resolve the issue of reprocessing safeguarded spent fuel.

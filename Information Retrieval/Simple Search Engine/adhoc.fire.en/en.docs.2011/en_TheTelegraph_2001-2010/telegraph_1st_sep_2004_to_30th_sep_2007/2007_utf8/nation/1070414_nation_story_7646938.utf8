 Delhi power for UP

 New Delhi, April 13 (PTI): Anil Ambanis BSES Rajdhani is supplying Delhis surplus power to Uttar Pradesh, sources said.

 The disclosure came on a day Delhi faced severe power shortage with three to four hours of load-shedding during peak hours. 

 BSES Rajdhani sources, however, dismissed suggestions that the power is being given to Uttar Pradesh, now in the middle of elections, because of the rapport between Ambani and chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav.

 The sources said the company, the distribution arm of Reliance Energy, is supplying power to the neighbouring state during off-peak hours after getting the governments approval.

 Uttar Pradesh quoted the highest price for the electricity that was not likely to be used in the national capital, they said, adding that the supply is not at the cost of consumers in Delhi.

 The capital went through a power crisis today due to a series of technical snags, official sources said.

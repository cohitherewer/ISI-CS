 Heat wont keep MP off sun 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Jan. 23: Amid protests from Muslim and Christian organisations, the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government is going ahead with its controversial surya namaskar programme in all state-run schools and colleges on Thursday.

 Even as a group of All India Muslim Personal Law Board members knocked on Jabalpur High Courts door seeking intervention, state education minister Narottam Mishra said all district collectors had been instructed to organise surya namaskar.

 He termed the programme as compulsory for government-run schools and colleges but voluntary for students.

 Surya namaskar is a yoga initiation exercise that is a salutation to the sun as the source of all energy.

 The programme is the brainchild of yoga guru Baba Ramdev who is expected to lead it on Thursday in Bhopal. He is a frequent visitor to Bhopal with the BJP regime rolling out the red carpet for him. Chauhan has promised him 2,000 acres to open a yoga university.

 Joining the Muslim protests, Bhopals archbishop Pascal Topno said: The practices of one religion should not be imposed on people of other religions. Muslims too have voiced their concern over the government decision because it is said to be against their religion. Similarly, one of our commandments says we should not bow down in front of any other God.

 Bhopals deputy qazi Ameerullah said Muslims were not opposed to yoga as such but were against the reported distribution of booklets carrying shlokas in schools that would be recited along with surya namaskar.

 We feel it is yet another attempt by the government to hurt our religious sentiments. We are not going to abide by it under any circumstances, he said recalling that some time ago the BJP regime had tried to make singing Vande Mataram in school mandatory but withdrawn it when Muslims threatened to move court.

 The Congress minority cell too has demanded immediate cancellation of the programme. Muslims are not against yoga and pranayam but such programmes should not be organised by the government. It is the responsibility of the government to honour all faiths instead of promoting any particular religion, state Congresss minority cell president Haji Mohammad Haroon said.

 Mishra, however, said the hue and cry was meaningless as the programme was aimed to inspire the youth to learn about yoga and its benefits. But Haroon said he would protest even if the government made participation voluntary.

 In doing so, the government in effect will be asking Muslim and Christian students not to come to schools and colleges that day and thus creating a rift between them and other students, he said.

 Over three lakh school children are expected to attend the programme, Mishra said.

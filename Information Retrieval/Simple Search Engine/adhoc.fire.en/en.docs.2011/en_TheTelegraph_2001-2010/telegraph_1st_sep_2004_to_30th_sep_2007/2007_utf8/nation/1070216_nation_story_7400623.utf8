 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 15: An American air hostess has been found dead in a hotel bathroom in suburban Mumbai.

 Marylin Duston, an employee of Delta Air Lines, was found sprawled on the bathroom floor last night with a blood-stained curtain wrapped around her neck. The 50-year-old woman was living in a single room in the Taj Mahal Palace amp; Tower in Colaba. 

 Duston had asked the hotel staff to wake her up at 9 pm, but when repeated calls to her room remained unanswered, hotel employees opened the door with a duplicate key around 9.45 pm and found her dead, Colaba police said. 

 She had checked into the hotel on Tuesday night along with other crew members of the airline and was put up in room number 311. According to the police, the rest of the crew checked out this morning. 

 The body was found in the bathroom, which was opened with a security key. There was a curtain wound around her neck. Seeing the circumstances, we have registered a case of accident. We have sent the body for post-mortem and investigations are on, Mumbai DCP Pratap Dighavkar said. 

 The cause of the death would be ascertained only after the autopsy, he added.

 BJP accepts Pratibha

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 24: The BJP will attend the swearing-in ceremony of Pratibha Patil tomorrow because it is a firm believer in the constitutional order.

 The party, however, made it clear it was not apologetic about the issues of corruption and criminal charges it raised against the President-elect in the run-up to the poll.

 Addressing the national executive meeting of the BJPs youth front, L.K. Advani said: The BJP considers the sanctity of the countrys highest constitutional office to be more important than the person who has been elected to occupy it. As a firm believer in the constitutional order, my party will continue to show due respect to the office.

 Advani added that the issues the BJP raked up in the campaign would continue to be as relevant in the time to come as they were before because the effort had provoked all right-thinking people in the country to seriously debate about the choice made by the leadership of the UPA.

 Without mentioning Pratibhas name, Advani accused the UPA leadership of showing callous disregard towards keeping the office of the President away from the suspicion of any kind of taint.

 Advani objected to the Prime Ministers remark that the poll verdict showed the UPAs victory over divisive forces. I wish he did some honest introspection on the serious issues that were highlighted by the media, Advani said.

 Apparently stung by the huge margin of Pratibhas victory, Advani tried to make a virtue out of B.S. Shekhawats rout. For a political party, an election victory enhances its credibility. It is an irony that in this case, the UPAs victory has only highlighted how chaotic the decision-making process is within the UPA.

 He put the win to the clear majority that she enjoyed in the electoral college and said if the general public could have voted, they would have certainly rejected Pratibha.

 The NDA sought to make this point by displaying a huge banner splashed with the signatures of aam janta collected on one of the pro-Shekhawat drives at India Gate.

 Asked if the BJP will give a wide berth to Pratibha, a leader said: Thats not tenable. We will have to deal with the office of the President. Moreover, we have to think of 2009 (the next general elections) and the role the President would play in a fractured polity.

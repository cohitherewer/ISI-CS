 London, Jan. 30: A tabloid newspaper today set a new record for coverage of a Bollywood star indeed, with a big picture of Shilpa Shetty on page one (in picture), the issue could become a collectors item for collectors of Hindi cinema memorabilia to be passed on as a family legacy. 

 The tabloid has devoted the front page Shilpa: Exclusive. Her amazing story in her own words plus pages 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 to the winner of Celebrity Big Brother. 

 To accompany the text, there are nine photographs of Shilpa, including a leggy one of her sitting on some stairs. One should hasten to add that by the standards of British tabloids, the pictures are demure, even coy. 

 A spokesman for the Daily Mirror said: The story has been of interest from the very beginning. 

 The Daily Mirror, which has paid at least 150,000 for the Shilpa exclusive the Suns 100,000 offer had to be exceeded also has an entire leader column on the theme: Bollywood star Shilpa Shettys triumph in Celebrity Big Brother was a victory for a better Britain. 

 It added: As Shilpa puts it today so eloquently, it wasnt a battle between brown and white but right and wrong and gloriously right won.

 Todays Daily Star could be another collectors item it has a Free Shilpa Poster inside. It has used the centrespread to publish one of Shilpas raunchier photographs, which the paper has found an excuse to use on more than one occasion. 

 Incidentally, as winner, Shilpa gets no extra prize money from Channel 4 apart from her entry fee of 225,000. Her advisers want her to stay in Britain for another seven-10 days to thrash out further deals.

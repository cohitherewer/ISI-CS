 Catalogue chain entry

 Shop till you drop

 London, Feb. 24: The Argos brand, a British retail chain which sells a wide range of consumer products via a thick, glossy catalogue, is coming to India, it has been announced in London. 

 Customers can either order online and opt for home delivery or go into a store, queue up after taking a numbered ticket and then pay for the product desired after making their choice from the catalogue. 

 Then follows a wait, which can be lengthy or brief depending on the queue, before the customers number is called on an amplifier when an assistant has located and fetched the product required from an adjoining warehouse. 

 Bulk buying allows Argos prices to be competitive. 

 Goods offered include iPods, television set, DVD players, digital cameras, camcorders, photo printers, PCs, phones, shredders, printers, toys, nursery objects, jewellery and watches, furniture and furnishings, sofas and chairs, beds, duvets, electric blankets, kitchen and laundry, washing machines, heaters, fans, bathroom fittings, satellite navigation for cars, DIY power tools and sports, cycling, fitness and home gym equipment. 

 What the customer cannot do is engage a sales assistant in a long conversation about the merits of a product, declare the object can be procured for a lower price elsewhere and walk out of the store expecting to be recalled. 

 The Argos brand, which was introduced 30 years ago, is owned by the Home Retail Group, which is expanding outside Europe for the first time. The group has 1,000 stores across the UK and the Republic of Ireland, employs 51,000 people and serves 200 million customers a year. 

 The groups chief executive, Terry Duddy, said the Indian move represented an opportunity to establish an initial foothold in a rapidly expanding market. 

 The company has signed a franchising agreement with two of Indias leading retailers Shoppers Stop and Hypercity Retail India to develop the Argos retail format in India. 

 While Argos is not upmarket, it does represent a popular way of shopping for the middle and budget markets. 

 A London housewife, who bought a breadmaker at a time when it was fashionable to make bread at home, said: It blew up because it was the cheapest make, but Argos was very good at replacing it.

 Mumbai, July 29: A serial caller who allegedly harassed Bollywood actresses such as Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra has been arrested in Hyderabad where police lured him using a starlet as decoy.

 Mairaj Rehman alias Don, 29, was once married to Sanjay Dutts current love interest, Maanyata, and claims to be the cousin of a former Indian cricket captain. He was brought to Mumbai after his arrest yesterday and will be in custody till Wednesday.

 The arrest will be met with a huge sigh of relief in Bollywood, where Rehman is believed to have harassed at least 32 women, including Rakhi Sawant, Kangana Ranaut, Neha Dhupia, Yukta Mookhey, Yana Gupta and Nagma.

 The Hyderabad resident faces four FIRs for outraging the modesty of women, which could get him a three-year term. He is also accused in 50 complaints of prank calls, which are a non-cognisable offence.

 Singer Ishita Arun, one of Rehmans targets, said she was happy he has been caught. He is a nuisance and a sick man who needs help, she said.

 The Hyderabad police took the help of a filmmaker and a small-time actress, Sambhavna Seth, to nab Rehman. His phones were tracked through the global positioning network and he was traced to a bar-cum-restaurant, a Mumbai police source said.

 Rehman claims he is a scriptwriter and owns a production firm, Heaven and Heart, in Hyderabad. He says he called up Kareena, Poonam Dhillon and Smriti Mishra to offer them film roles.

 The man had been arrested twice before but received bail both times. But this time, with the cognisable charges, the situation could be different, an officer said.

 The first time the Mumbai police tracked Rehman down in Hyderabad several years ago, he had jumped off the third floor of his apartment building, fracturing both his legs.

 His second arrest came in Mumbai in October 2005, but he got bail three months later. He then left for Hyderabad and missed court hearings.

 After he was accused of harassing a small-time actress, Sapna, and Kareenas secretary Zahid Khan, a Mumbai court cancelled his bail. Mairaj is said to have bought 16 SIM cards with which he made the calls.

 Maanyata, a former item girl, had married him in 2005 but has alleged that he soon began abusing her physically. She said when she asked for a divorce, Rehman disappeared with her passport and other papers.

 Maanyata was not available for comment on the arrest as she is abroad.

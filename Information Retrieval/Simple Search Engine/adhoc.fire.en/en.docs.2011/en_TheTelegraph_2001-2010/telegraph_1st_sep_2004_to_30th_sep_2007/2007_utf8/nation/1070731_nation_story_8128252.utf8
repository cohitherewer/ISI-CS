 Judge posts under glare

 New Delhi, July 30 (PTI): The Supreme Court today asked the Centre to file a report on the appointment of permanent judges in high courts since 1999 after a petitioner challenged a Madras High Court judges appointment.

 The report will have to throw light on the number of additional judges elevated as permanent judges of the high courts, how many such elevations were made on the recommendations of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and the number of such judges appointed on the recommendations of the Supreme Court collegium. 

 A bench of Justices Arijit Pasayat and D.K. Jain asked additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam to file the affidavit within six weeks and posted the matter for hearing in the third week of September.

 The court order came on a petition filed by former Union law minister Shanti Bhushan, questioning the power of the CJI to appoint a judge even after the apex court collegium refused to recommend him. 

 Bhushans query was on the appointment of Justice Ashok Kumar as a permanent judge of Madras High Court despite the Supreme Court collegiums refusal to recommend his name in August 2005.

 Senior counsel Anil Divan, appearing for Bhushan, submitted that Kumar was first appointed in April 2003 as an additional judge of the high court and his services had been extended from time to time.

 But the August 2005 collegium comprising then Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal and two senior judges refused to elevate him as a permanent judge because of adverse reports against him, Divan said.

 Kumar was, however, made a permanent judge of the high court in February this year, disregarding a law laid down by the apex court in the special reference judgment case of 1998.

 In the 1998 case, an apex court bench had ruled that appointments of judges were subject to judicial review. 

 According to the rules, the appointment or elevation of a high court judge is made on the recommendation of the collegium in consultation with Supreme Court judges conversant with the affairs of the court in question. The collegium generally comprises the CJI and the two seniormost judges of the apex court.

 School check-up rules

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: The Centre has decided to frame rules governing medical check-ups in schools, a fortnight after students in a Delhi school were asked to strip for health tests without parental consent.

 Sardar Patel Vidyalaya had earlier this month allowed medical practitioners from a private hospital to conduct tests, where students were asked to remove their clothes, sparking protests from embarrassed children and their parents.

 Parents complained that the school had neither informed the students about the nature of the tests ostensibly a study on adolescent growth patterns nor sought consent from guardians. 

 Boys there were 194 of them were asked to remove their pants, while doctors touched their genitals without wearing gloves. They also touched the private parts of the 185 girls who underwent the tests.

 The school, however, has maintained that it was under the impression that the doctors would conduct a routine medical check-up and that it was not aware that the children would be asked to strip. 

 Under the guidelines, to be prepared on the basis of an inquiry into the incident reported on July 20 in The Telegraph parental consent before even a simple dental check-up is likely to be made mandatory for schools.

 There is no reason to believe that the incident was unique. Until there are strict rules laid out for all schools, protection of the privacy of children cannot be guaranteed, said a member of the inquiry team, which submitted its report today.

 The probe has been conducted by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, a body set up by the Centre in the wake of the Nithari mass murder of children. The probe team consists of commission member Sandhya Bajaj and lawyer Ashok Agarwal.

 The ministries of human resource development and health and family welfare, who will jointly frame the rules, are also likely to recommend that parents be invited by schools when such tests are held.

 The inquiry report demands a public apology from Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, which has among its students relatives of several top politicians, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs grandson.

 However, the report a copy is with The Telegraph neither seeks cancellation of the schools licence nor asks it to pay any compensation to the children. 

 The Medical Council of India has been asked to review the licences of the six doctors led by K.N. Agarwal of Metro Hospital who had conducted the tests.

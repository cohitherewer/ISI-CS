 Ahmedabad/New Delhi, July 16: Gujarat police today charged 13 officers for the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter but gave their political bosses a clean chit, inviting accusations that the probe was an eyewash.

 The 700-page charge sheet, handed to a metropolitan court here by the state CID, said deputy inspector-general D.G. Vanzaras pursuit of personal glory was the lone motive behind the killing of the gangster.

 Sohrabuddin was pulled out of a Hyderabad-Mumbai bus with his wife Kauser Bi on the outskirts of Ahmedabad and shot by a joint team of Gujarat and Rajasthan police in November 2005. 

 The policemen, who are accused of later killing Kauser, said Sohrabuddin was a Lashkar-e-Toiba militant and was on a mission to assassinate chief minister Narendra Modi.

 Vanzara, the police team leader, thought shooting a terrorist would be a quick way to gain promotion and personal gain in career, the charge sheet said.

 Hours later in the Supreme Court, which had ordered the probe, the court-appointed counsel accused the CID of making a mockery of justice and letting off the real offenders.

 Additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam, appointed amicus curiae (friend of the court), said: Something was clearly wrong in the probe and the charge sheet was nothing but a gateway for people to escape.

 Vanzara, in judicial custody with 11 of the other chargesheeted policemen, was widely known as Modis blue-eyed boy and had risen fast up the ranks. The star of many encounters, he used to take his orders from the highest levels, often bypassing his immediate superiors, police sources said.

 The clean chit to politicians will gladden state home minister Amit Shah, known to be close to Modi, and the BJPs Gujarat minder, Om Mathur. Shah had come under a cloud following several dubious police encounters during his tenure, and was said to have decided to resign if the apex court ordered a CBI probe.

 The investigation, ordered on a petition from Sohrabuddins brother Rubabuddin, has been chased by political controversy. The state government had removed the head of the probe team, inspector-general Geeta Johri, midway and then reinstated her when the apex court demanded an explanation.

 The state police chief then raised a furore by asking Johri to report to a senior officer although the court had ordered an independent probe.

 The accused nine from Gujarat and four from Rajasthan include three IPS officers: Vanzara and superintendents Rajkumar Pandian and M. Dinesh.

 All the accused except CID deputy superintendent N.K. Amin are in judicial custody. Their remand expires on July 23 when they will appear in court for an extension or bail. Amin, Vanzaras right-hand man, who is accused of disposing of Kausers body, had secured anticipatory bail.

 The CID, which recorded the statements of 179 witnesses, believes that the Andhra Pradesh police had colluded in the kidnapping of Sohrabuddin.

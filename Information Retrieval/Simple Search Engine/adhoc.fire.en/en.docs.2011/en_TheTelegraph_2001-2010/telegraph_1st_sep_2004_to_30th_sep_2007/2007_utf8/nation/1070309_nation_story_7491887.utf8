 CM rallies Left forces on Tata

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhattacharjee

 Calcutta, March 8: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today held a meeting of his cabinets core committee to brief Left Front allies on the agreement with Tata Motors before making a statement on the Singur deal in the Assembly.

 The meeting, the first of its kind since the front returned to power last May, was called to close ranks among the allies before the Bengal chief minister faces the Opposition, which has been protesting against acquisition of farmland for industry.

 The CPMs three major front partners, the CPI, RSP and the Forward Bloc, are also opposed to the governments industrialisation drive.

 Among those who attended the meeting were the RSPs Kshiti Goswami, CPI leader Nandagopal Bhattacharya and the Forward Blocs Naren De, besides industry minister Nirupam Sen and finance minister Asim Dasgupta.

 According to front sources, the chief minister said of the 997 acres originally set aside for the Tata plant, around 645 acres would be leased out directly now. Ancillary units would come up in another 270-odd acres while the government would develop markets and kiosks for local landlosers in another 65 acres. The land would be leased out to the Tatas for 90 years.

 The company would pay Rs 1 crore a year for the first 30 years as lease rent and the amount might be increased after that. The Tatas would also have to pay an annual interest of .01 per cent on the around Rs 140 crore the government has spent on acquiring the land.

 The government considers the payment of land price as a long-term loan to Tata Motors, the chief minister reportedly explained to the allies.

 The sources said the ministers of the CPMs allies resented such long-term tax relief and land price subsidies.

 The government also proposes to waive the 12 per cent value-added tax that the automobile industry has to pay. In return, Bhattacharjee said, the project would generate at least 16,000-17,000 jobs, including direct employment for 2,700. The Tatas would also set up three ITIs to train local youths in automobile and allied technology.

 Bhattacharjee, who will address front MLAs tomorrow, however, made it clear that negotiations were still on.

 Land talks tip

 Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi said the government was willing to discuss aspects relating to the Singur project.

 A number of new investment proposals from major companies have been received and are under different stages of examination and implementation. These include the Tata Motors project at Singur, he said in his address during the budget session, which began today.

 I reiterate the governments willingness to discuss aspects pertaining to this project with leaders of the Opposition.

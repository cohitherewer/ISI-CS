 Salim stays hopeful on Nandigram

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 2: The Salim Group has said it has not been told of any plan to shift the proposed chemical hub from Nandigram.

 I am confident our project in Nandigram will come up at the right time. I have not heard about any change in the site, Prasoon Mukherjee, the Jakarta-based NRI associated with the Salim Group, said this afternoon after talks with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 I have been told that the government is convincing the villagers so that the project comes up at Nandigram, he added.

 The chief minister, who had said the government would not proceed with the project in Nandigram if the people did not want it, declined comment today.

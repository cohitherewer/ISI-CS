 Print pioneer dead

 Arun Bose, a pioneer printmaker, who spent a good part of his life in New York as a teacher of printmaking and painting at City University, died in New York on Wednesday after prolonged illness. 

 Born in 1934, Boses family had migrated from Dhaka and he was brought up in a house in Colootolla where he would return from time to time to a warm reception from former students such as Bikash Bhattacharjee and old associates like Shyamal Datta Ray.

 Bose (in picture) graduated from Government Art College in 1950 and taught for six years at Indian Art College. His students still remember and respect him as an inspiring mastermoshai.

 Bose went to Paris for higher studies in painting and printmaking. There, he met Krishna Reddy, who took him to Hayters Atelier 17. 

 He returned for a longish stint at Government Art College, after which he went on a Rockefeller Third Fund Fellowship to New York. 

 At City University, where he was a professor for several years, Bose established one of the biggest departments of printmaking in the world.

 In spite of all those years in the US, he was a Calcuttan at heart and this came across in his work. Bose could create flawlessly finished paintings and prints haunted by visions of old courtyards where peacocks strut about, and tiled roofs on which pigeons perch.

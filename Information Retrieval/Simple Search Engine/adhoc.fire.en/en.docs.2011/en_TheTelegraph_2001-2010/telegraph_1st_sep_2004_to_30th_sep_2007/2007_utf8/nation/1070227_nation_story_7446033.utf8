The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 AC for Bengal but little warmth

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 26: An air-conditioned coach here, an escalator there.

 Throw in some line extensions and the Bengal chapter in Lalu Prasads fairy-tale budget is over.

 During the 11th Five-Year Plan, efforts will be made to introduce air-conditioned trains in suburban services in Calcutta, escalators at major stations, along with new trains and extended train lines to various destinations in the City of Joy, Lalu Prasad said in the railway budget.

 A new train added in the region will run daily between Howrah and Rampurhat. Two garib raths have also been introduced the Calcutta-Patna Express will ply three days a week and the Calcutta-Guwahati train two days a week. 

 Political parties in Bengal reacted with dismay.

 Biman Bose, the CPMs Bengal secretary and Left Front chairman, criticised the budget for not meeting the demand for new projects. There is no significant project for the state, except for a new train and two garib raths. There is also no new project for train connectivity. 

 Bose said the budget failed to make any specific allocation or assurance on the Calcutta Metro rail extension from Tollygunge to Garia.

 Trinamul Congress MLA Saugata Roy called the rail budget a budget of gimmicks. The RSP claimed the budget measures were aimed at serving the interests of big industrial houses. 

 Some train lines have been extended to connect more destinations with the state. These include Sealdah-Ajmer Ananya Express going to Udaipur, Sealdah-Darbhanga Gangasagar Express till Jainagar, and Howrah-Darbhanga Passenger going to Jainagar.

 The frequency of the Howrah-Guwahati Saraighat Express has been increased from five days to seven days a week.

 Chair in B-school

 Management guru Lalu Prasads special affection for the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, came to the fore today.

 He announced the establishment of a railway chair at the B-school for research in railway infrastructure and management. Lalu Prasad had been invited to IIM-A last year, where he had also addressed visiting students of Wharton Business School.

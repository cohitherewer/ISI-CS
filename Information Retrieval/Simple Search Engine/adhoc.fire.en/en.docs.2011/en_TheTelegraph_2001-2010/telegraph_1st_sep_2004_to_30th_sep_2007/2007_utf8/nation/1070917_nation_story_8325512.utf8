 Swift probe to save army face

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: Army headquarters has asked for investigations into high-profile cases against its soldiers to be completed within a month of the appointment of a court of inquiry. 

 This follows complaints of delay in action on cases involving human rights issues in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast. 

 The order has been sent to all eight commands of the service but it has officers fuming because of its impractical demands. The officers say the army is ill-equipped for the policing role that the investigations demand of it. 

 A copy of the order is with The Telegraph.

 A court of inquiry is usually the first stage of investigations and is ordered for nearly all unusual incidents in the armed forces, ranging from accidental air crashes to fragging (soldier killing soldier) and complaints of harassment of civilians. 

 The vice-chief of army staff (and army chief-designate), Lt General Deepak Kapoor, has directed all commands of the army that henceforth C of Is (courts of inquiry) in high-profile cases which are under media glare will be completed in one months time.

 The order came after public protests in Kashmir against a fake encounter killing in February this year gave the army a bad name. The vice-chief pointed to an alleged fake encounter in Ganderbal. 

 A court of inquiry was appointed in February but it is yet to be finalised thereby giving rise to many queries from the ministry of defence, the order states.

 Jammu and Kashmir police complained that a man killed by troops in Ganderbal was not who the army said he was, a militant of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, Abu Zahid. He was Abdul Rehman Padroo, a carpenter.

 The vice-chief of army staff has observed with concern that there is undue delay in completion of C of Is in important cases relating to alleged fake encounters, fratricide (soldier killing soldier), unnatural deaths, rapes etc, the order notes. 

 This generates adverse publicity for the army as an organisation and its system of investigation and justice. 

 It asks commanders to ensure that delay reports with reasons for delay (sic) will have to be given to the headquarters discipline and vigilance branch every fortnight.

 The order allows army headquarters to explain to the defence ministry that it is taking action. 

 But, senior officers say, it is a knee-jerk reaction to pressure from the bureaucracy to show results on human rights issues. 

 A senior officer said the vice-chiefs order was issued more than three weeks ago but no report has been filed so far. 

 Besides, they ask why it should be limited to cases under media glare and not cover others that might be equally important.

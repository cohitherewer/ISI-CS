 A rival looms on India Gate

 OUR BUREAU

 Not tall enough?

 New Delhi, May 22: A new war memorial dedicated to the unsung soldiers of the 1857 war of independence may dwarf India Gate.

 Tourists often mistake India Gate as high as a 13-storey building to be a national war memorial. The monument was built by the British to honour the soldiers who died during World War I and the Afghan battles. 

 The government has agreed, in principle, to our request of building a memorial bigger than India Gate. At least 300 guerrilla wars were fought against the British in 1857, said freedom fighter and former MP Shashi Bhushan. He is a member of the committee organising the celebrations to mark 150 years of the revolt.

 The plan for the memorial has been placed before the same committee, which is headed by HRD minister Arjun Singh. Shivraj Patil, Mani Shankar Aiyar and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi are among the other members.

 Sources say the request for the 1857 memorial will soon be sent to the Delhi government, which will allot land. 

 But the decision to build a new memorial could lead to a row with the army, which has been pressing for a national war memorial in Delhi that remembers its own.

 Countless soldiers have died in wars fought by the Indian Army after Independence. These include 1,100 in the 1947-48 operation to drive out Pakistani intruders, 3,250 in the 1962 China war, 3,264 in the 1965 Pakistan war and 3,843 in the 1971 Pakistan war. Another 1,157 were killed in peacekeeping operations in Sri Lanka and 522 in the Kargil conflict.

 Many more have died in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast fighting insurgents.

 The file on a national war memorial has been moving back and forth between the defence and urban development ministries for over five years. The army wants the monument in central Delhi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Allies by PM side

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 17: The Prime Minister enjoys full support on the nuclear deal within the coalition he leads.

 Although some United Progressive Alliance leaders feel that Manmohan Singh might have been wiser to avoid daring the Left to withdraw support, none has misgivings about the Indo-US agreement itself.

 Rural development minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said the deal favoured India and that most of those objecting to it might not have understood its nuances.

 He questioned the Lefts unrelenting anti-Americanism, arguing that the world had changed and there was no use spoiling Delhis relations with Washington.

 The Nationalist Congress Party, DMK and the Lok Janshakti Party, too, support the deal. NCP Rajya Sabha member Tariq Anwar said not only was the deal good for India, it was already done and there was no point asking for a re-negotiation now.

 12 years for marks forgery

 WIELDING THE ROD

 Mumbai, Jan 10: A former law student was handed a prison term of twelve and a half years for manipulating mark sheets in collusion with Nagpur University employees.

 Sunil Mishra, who now heads a board at the universitys mass communication wing, was a first-year student in 1995. A fake-degree scandal broke at the university during 1995-99. His is the third judgment in 80 detected cases.

 The Maharashtra governments special investigation team (SIT) that probed the racket found that Mishra, then president of the National Students Union of India (NSUI) at the university, had failed the exam, managing to secure only 23 marks out of 100 in his Law of Torts paper. After a request for revaluation, his answer scripts were sent to two professors. 

 One gave Mishra 9 out of 100 and the other 36, says the SIT chargesheet. The scores were then sent for tabulation, a process in which 09 was changed to 69 and 36 to 65. The tampering and overwriting on the mark sheets were clearly visible, special public R.P. Joshi said. 

 University-appointed professors are supposed to check revaluation and tabulation registers. Mishras final mark sheet was signed by university employee Madhukar Smarth. 

 However, Prakash Mistry, the controller of examinations when Mishra appeared for his test, was acquitted after prosecution failed to produce enough evidence. Two other accused in the case died by the time trial in the cases commenced on January 22 last year.

 They had been charged under Sections 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery), 471 (using bogus documents as genuine), and 409 (criminal breach of trust by a public servant or an agent) of the Indian Penal Code. 

 On December 28 last year, the court had sentenced Yadav Kohchade, a dismissed assistant registrar of the university, to twelve and half years of imprisonment for his role in forging mark sheets and selling bogus degrees. 

 The anti-corruption bureau had also caught Kohchade offering a bribe of Rs 7 lakh to a police official to get him to conceal his involvement in the scandal.

 On the same day, Mohammed Ishaq, the alleged mastermind of the scandal and a merit-rank student, was punished with a jail term of nine and a half years for using a forged mark sheet. 

 In August 2006, the court had handed Deenanath Nagpure a seven-year jail term and asked him to pay a fine of Rs 20,000.

 The special court had been set up on the orders of Bombay High Court following a public interest petition filed by a local journalist who sought a quick trial in the scandal.

 Vice-chancellor B.B. Chopane and other top university officials had resigned in the wake of the scandal in 1999, but the cases were kept pending in court for five years. This had prompted the public interest plea.

 The scandal had forced the then governor of Maharashtra, P.C. Alexander, to order an overhaul of procedure for revaluation of mark sheets and to incorporate strict security procedures to ensure that university employees or students couldnt manipulate the process.

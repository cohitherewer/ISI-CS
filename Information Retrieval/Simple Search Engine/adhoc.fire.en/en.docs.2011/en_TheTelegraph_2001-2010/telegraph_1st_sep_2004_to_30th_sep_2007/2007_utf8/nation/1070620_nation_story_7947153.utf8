 Rahman at show, minus a suitcase

 - BA replay on missing luggage

 Rahman, Shilpa: Count your bags

London, June 19: British Airways, which mislaid six of Shilpa Shettys 10 suitcases just before she was due to perform at the IIFA events in Yorkshire recently, today lost A.R. Rahmans luggage just before the formal opening of his musical. 

 The composer, who had to undertake some last-minute shopping in London, landed at Heathrow on BA flight 224 from Washingtons Dulles airport minus one of his two suitcases. 

 The one suitcase that arrived unfortunately didnt have much, said Rahman, as he headed in a cab for Oxford Street and Bond Street with his assistant Simon Long to see what he could buy before the opening night of the 25-million West End musical, Lord of the Rings, for which he has partly composed the music. 

 He had hoped to look elegant in his Indian clothes but BA has put paid to that, just as the airline did with Shilpa. 

 The composer had made the mistake of putting many of his valuables into his now-missing suitcase to avoid being harassed at Dulles. 

 You know what American airports are like its like going through nuclear checks, said Rahman, who arrived in London today after a concert in America. 

 I put my laptop in there, with all my music, plus my CDs and DVDs, plus the Indian clothes I was going to wear for the next two-three days, Rahman said. 

 The Daily Mail newspaper has been running an anti-BA campaign for its habit of losing luggage. Todays report BA baggage fiasco leaves 6,000 cases in the rain said: British Airways was last forced to drive a mountain of luggage across Europe by lorry after losing 6,000 cases in a baggage-handling fiasco. 

 When Rahman contacted BA, the airline shrugged off his query. They told me they have no idea where my luggage is. Its not in London and its not in Washington. I am happy today since my musical is opening tonight but this will hit me tomorrow.

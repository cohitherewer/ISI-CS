 Peace with mom-in-law, in three weeks

 Chandigarh, July 8: A wedding specialist is offering a crash course to solve one of the greatest mysteries in the world: how to get along with your mother-in-law.

 International Trade and Exhibition Group (ITE) has decided there is little point in limiting itself to offering advice on bridal beauty and trousseau tips. 

 With spats between brides and mothers-in-law turning households into war zones before the ink on wedding cards can dry, a more explosive problem was waiting to be to be resolved and, perhaps, explored as a potential money-spinner.

 The first of these ITE institutes will be opened in Jaipur, where the feuding is believed to be particularly fierce. ITE director Kiran Sharma says the urge to break away from tradition is more pronounced in big towns. 

 While the saas wants the bahu to adhere to whatever she lays down, the bahu wants to exercise her freedom. Most of the clashes occur at this point. Both need correctional courses, Sharma said on phone from Ludhiana.

 Cooking classes will spice up the three-week course, whose focus will be on fostering closeness between the two family pillars. Both sides will be treated to conflict busters. 

 ITE hit upon the idea of an institute after its survey in Rajasthan found that such relationships were far from cordial. We feel everyone needs a change in their behaviour patterns. There are occasions when the husband must change his attitude when he is thrust into the middle of a saas-bahu problem, Sharma explained.

 Mothers-in-law, psychologists and eminent women personalities will coach the students, guiding them on ways to negotiate the potential minefields of family feuds.

 We will enact situations that are normal in most households and suggest ways to tackle them. For the saas, it is important to treat her bahu as her own daughter, and vice-versa. We will not be giving just tips but making a genuine effort to ensure peace in homes, Sharma said.

 A lot of stress will be laid on extinguishing kitchen flare-ups, given the desire among many to see their daughters-in-law give celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor a run for his money. Cooking is important because every saas wants a bahu who can prepare food well and in modern towns, few girls know how to cook, Sharma stressed.

 Courses for husbands, fathers-in-law, sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law are also planned, but Sharma did not say how much evidence there was on their frequency of combat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Stage set for drama schools

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 

 Kher, Naseeruddin: More to follow?

 New Delhi, March 10: Seven IITs, six IIMs and only one NSD. But the equation may soon change.

 Fifty years after the countrys premier theatre school took birth, the Centre is considering setting up five more National Schools of Drama (NSD) across the country to save the rapidly dying art in India. 

 Calcutta and Bangalore have been finalised as two of the centres the remaining three sites are still being decided. Guwahati is almost certain to be one of them, said sources on the NSD board. A school is planned for western India either in Maharashtra, Gujarat or Goa. 

 And the north will see the final one. Several members of the NSD board are believed to be in favour of Jammu and Kashmir. 

 The new schools are the need of the hour. As essential as water to a dying man, when it comes to solving some of the problems facing theatre in our country, Devendraj Ankur, NSD director told The Telegraph today. 

 The alma mater of stars like Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher admits just 20 students a year for its three-year undergraduate course, leading to a huge seat crunch for aspirants. 

 Most of the work in the Delhi school is in Hindi, since our funds dictate that most performances are for Delhi audiences. A student from Calcutta is, therefore, at a disadvantage while studying in the school. That problem will also get solved, Ankur said. 

 In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha on Thursday, minister of state for urban development Ajay Maken said the Centre was still to decide on a time frame for setting up the schools. 

 The NSD board has recommended that the schools be built one each year to avoid a funds crunch. The board has asked the Planning Commission to initially allocate Rs 3 crore for each of the schools.

 The total budgetary allocation for the Delhi NSD currently is Rs 13 crore Rs 9 crore as planned, the remainder as the non-planned component. 

 Bangalore is likely to have the first of the new five, since NSD already has a part-time school in the Garden City. Either Calcutta or Guwahati, or another site in the Northeast, is expected to be next. 

 The new schools will be modelled on the one in Delhi. 

 All students study the same course in the first year. In the second year, students can choose between acting and production, Ankur said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Not a ripple, just watchful silence in dry lake-bed angling for maritime hub

 The bare, dry lake-bed off this nondescript village looks hardly the sort of place to tempt the countrys shipping minister into a brawl.

 But the 300-acre bowl of dust in Semmanchery is where T.R. Baalu wants to steer his ship of a central maritime university to, bypassing the countrys leading marine engineering institute in Calcutta.

 Days after the move provoked Left MPs into a showdown in Parliament, no ripples are visible in this placid village in DMK leader Baalus South Chennai constituency. The village itself is hardly visible.

 After you have endured an hours bumpy ride to cover the 25 km from Chennai, along the Old Mahaballipuram Road and then on a dirt track, its easy to miss Semmanchery unless you know about the quaint 1,000-year-old Vishnu temple that serves as a road sign.

 A couple of panchayat buildings stand beside a community hall that proudly announces itself to be Baalus gift from his MP local area development funds. Theres no sign of any activity anywhere, the only symbol of modernity being a rectangular plot thats been converted into a parking lot for scores of Volvo buses.

 These buses transport techies to and from the nearby offices of TCS and Cognizant, set up in an area the state wants to turn into an IT corridor with a six-lane highway.

 Semmancherys placid appearance, therefore, can be deceptive. Its silence stems more from a tense watchfulness after the Parliament ruckus that sent Baalus blueprint to a standing committee.

 Nobody here wants to talk about exactly where the Indian Maritime University (IMU) campus would come up if the House panel gives the thumbs-up to Semmanchery.

 In the village, you can see signs of a private promoter developing a part of the land, presumably for a small housing complex for the techies. Walk on, and a stone signboard springs up.

 Trespassers will be prosecuted, it says, informing you the land ahead is central government property. A vast, vacant space stares back at you.

 It looks almost eerie, a deserted stretch with just a few palm trees and thorny shrubs. The only thing the villagers will tell you is that it belonged to the salt department till the industries ministry recently handed it over to the shipping ministry.

 So what led to Semmancherys claims trumping those of not just Calcutta but Mumbai, home to three maritime institutes?

 Mumbai was the first choice but no land was available there, central officials in Chennai say. The authorities at Calcuttas Marine Engineering and Research Institute, however, argue that no new site was needed: their Taratala campus would have sufficed.

 Given the history, infrastructure and faculty strength of MERI, it should have been the logical choice, the institute director told The Telegraph. Three years ago, a University Grants Commission team had recommended just that.

 But Semmanchery has its own logic. Just 5 km away, off the East Coast Road, stands a red-brick structure, the National Maritime Academy, in the village of Utthandy. Built by the shipping ministry in the late 80s, its a nodal training centre for officers of all the 12 major ports in India. It now offers a BSc in nautical science in collaboration with Ignou.

 If the maritime university comes up here, the NMA would be part of it.

 The sources in Chennai said that the MERIs of Calcutta and Mumbai had nothing to worry. Nor did the Lal Bahadur Shastri College of Advanced Maritime Studies and Research, Mumbai, and the Indian Institute of Maritime Studies, Mumbai. Affiliation to the IMU would rob them of neither identity nor autonomy.

 They can choose to retain the old service conditions, too, an official said.

 At MERI, Calcutta, officials argue that their institute would be hurt in the long run. The new courses will naturally be launched at the headquarters, attracting the best brains, an official said.

 In Chennai, officials say the university will help India, a leading supplier of merchant navy personnel to the global market, ward off competition from China, the Philippines and Southeast Asia.

 It will standardise the syllabi at the 100-odd private institutes across India offering marine engineering and related courses. It will take up new areas of research, such as oceanography and marine environment.

 The IMU will be part of a larger National Maritime Complex, with an aquarium and government offices in the marine sector, an official said. It will take a huge load off the directorate-general of shipping.

 kerala rsquo;s maritime plans

 Thiruvananthapuram, March 19 (PTI): The Centre will be asked to set up a distant campus of the proposed maritime university in Kerala, chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan told the Assembly today.

 Replying to a submission by the Congress rsquo;s K.V. Thomas, he said the tourism potential and job opportunities in the sector could be tapped by Kerala, which has a rich maritime

 history.

 The state, with a 700-km-long coast, has had trade links with many countries in the past.

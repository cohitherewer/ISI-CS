 Sanghs Nepal connection

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, April 11: A day before violent clashes between the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (MJF) and Maoists claimed 25 lives in the southern plains of Nepal, MJF chairman Upendra Yadav was confabulating with the RSS in Delhi.

 RSS sources confirmed that Yadav was in Delhi between March 18 and 20. 

 Just a day following his meeting with Sangh functionaries, on March 21, violence erupted in Gaur, a town 80 km south-east of Kathmandu. At least 25 Maoists were killed.

 During his visit, the MJF chairman met Baleshwar Aggarwal, an RSS functionary who runs the Antar-Rashtriya Sahyog Parishad (Forum for International Cooperation), on March 19.

 Yadav was here on March 19. He came to my office. He went back to Nepal on March 20, Aggarwal said. However, Nepalese sources claim that Yadav has been hiding in India since the Gaur massacre.

 Aggarwal admitted that Yadav met several like-minded people in Delhi. But he refused to reveal the names of other RSS functionaries who met Yadav on March 19.

 According to Tarun Vijay, editor of RSS mouthpiece Panchjanya, a meeting had been organised in which Yadav, too, was present. I was asked to attend the meeting. But I could not make it. I would not know who all attended it, Vijay said. 

 It is learnt that the government has sent clear signals of its disapproval of Yadavs activities in India. 

 While sympathising with the issues of representation being raised by the Madhesis, India does not want to encourage any element which may destabilise Nepal or obstruct the ongoing political transition there. The RSS, therefore, is the lone support group for the MJF in India.

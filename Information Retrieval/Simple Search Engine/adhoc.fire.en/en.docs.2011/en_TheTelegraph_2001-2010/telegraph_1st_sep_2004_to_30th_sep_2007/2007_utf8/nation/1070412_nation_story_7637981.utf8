 Wary BJP plays CD deflector

 New Delhi, April 11: The BJP has bought one more day to fight the CD battle by taking its campaign against election commissioner Navin Chawla to the panels lair.

 Accused of distributing the inflammatory CD in Uttar Pradesh, the party is facing proceedings that carry as punishment de-recognition as well as loss of the election symbol.

 At todays hearing before the commission, BJP strategist Arun Jaitley managed to shift the focus from the anti-Muslim CD to whether Chawla is competent to judge the BJP. As a result, the Election Commission scheduled another hearing tomorrow.

 The party has filed a petition in the Supreme Court for Chawlas removal from the commission, which will be heard on Friday. The BJP has accused Chawla of accepting funds from some Congress leaders before he joined the poll panel. Chawla has denied any misconduct.

 Jaitley today said Chawlas natural bias against the BJP was reason enough for him to be taken off when the panel is hearing petitions against the party.

 BJP insiders admit these are delaying tactics, because on the real charge of circulating the CD, the BJP is treading on thin ice. 

 The CD in question is not the only objectionable campaign material that the BJP has been accused of circulating. The party had allegedly distributed another CD with inflammatory content.

 Although the BJP claimed that the second CD was distributed much before the model code of conduct came into force in Uttar Pradesh, party spokespersons have admitted that this disc, too, was meant for use during the campaign.

 The BJPs rivals feel that the CDs constitute repeated violation of the law, for which the punishment is de-recognition and freezing of symbol.

 Under the circumstances, BJP strategists realised that their best option was to deflect attention from the CD.

 For one-and-a-half hours, Jaitley kept his audience in the Election Commission engaged with arguments about why Chawla should not sit in the hearing.

 There is a clear precedent T.N. Seshan as chief election commissioner was to hear a petition by Subramaniam Swamy against Jayalalithaa. But the Supreme Court debarred him from hearing the case simply because Swamys wife had appeared as a lawyer for Seshan in another case, Jaitley said.

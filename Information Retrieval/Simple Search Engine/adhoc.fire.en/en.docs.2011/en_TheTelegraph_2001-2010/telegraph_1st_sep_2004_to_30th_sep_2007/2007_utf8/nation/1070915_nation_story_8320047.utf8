The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Pak call for joint cyber fight

 NISHIT DHOLABHAI

 Net bond

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: Pakistan today said it wanted to join forces with India in fighting cyber crime.

 The offer was made at the concluding session of the seventh Interpol conference on cyber crime, where experts from 36 countries discussed ways to combat the menace.

 The event was marked by unusual bonhomie between the two sides. The good vibes came in the shadow of blasts that have rocked both nations in recent months.

 Channels have been established for cooperation between our two countries since cyber crime is a global scourge, Ammar H. Jaffari, project director at the centre for cyber crime in Pakistans Federal Investigation Agency, said. 

 Pakistan was willing to cooperate in the effort, Jaffari said, adding the time has come to join hands. But he made it clear that talks between the nations would only be held on global platforms, like the Interpol conference they were attending.

 Fighting Net crime acquired urgency after cyber attacks on Estonia in May when all government and business sites were crippled by unending waves of spam. 

 Estonia accused Russia of carrying out the assault, but many countries believed greater cooperation, not confrontation, was needed to foil such strikes. Experts from India worked with those of Nato to help Estonia shore up its electronic defences. 

 The delegates from Pakistan agreed India was ahead in information technology, but Jaffari said Pakistan, too, was trying to take the leap. 

 Five cyber criminals have been convicted in Pakistan under its 2002 electronic transaction ordinance.

 Indias communications minister A. Raja told the conference that the countrys IT laws were being revamped to tackle security concerns arising out of cyber crime. 

 The proposed amendments address concerns such as data protection, data theft, e-commerce frauds, child pornography, identity theft and privacy issues, he added.

 Noboru Nakatani, the assistant director in the Interpol sub-directorate handling high-tech crimes, agreed. What happens online has consequences offline. 

 Besides terrorists using the Internet to plot attacks, India and Pakistan have to battle child pornography and online identity theft. 

 Identity thieves steal credit card numbers and passwords. Even software is not spared.

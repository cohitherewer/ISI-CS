 Hiccup in nuke fine print

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, June 3: Differences between India and the US on the nuclear deal go beyond New Delhis freedom to reprocess spent fuel, on which the two sides appeared to have the biggest disagreement at the end of yesterdays talks in New Delhi.

 For instance, one provision in the latest draft of the 123 Agreement, so called after a provision in US law, says: This Agreement does not require the transfer of any information that the Parties are not permitted under their respective treaties, national laws, and regulations to transfer.

 External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee was obviously referring to the above paragraph when he said in Shimla today that the Bush administration was facing some legal constraints in sealing the 123 Agreement.

 Other paragraphs say restricted data shall not be transferred under this Agreement and that sensitive nuclear technology shall not be transferred under this Agreement unless provided for by an amendment to this Agreement.

 It further defines sensitive nuclear technology as any information (including information incorporated in equipment or an important component) that is not in the public domain and that is important to the design, construction, fabrication, operation, or maintenance of any sensitive nuclear facility, or other such information which may be so designated by agreement of the Parties.

 Sections of the Indian negotiating team, which have an understanding of the real issues involved in the nuclear deal, are still concerned that these provisions are aimed at capping or even rolling back Indias nuclear programme at the right time.

 They say such sweeping provisions make a mockery of the repeated Indian claim that the Hyde Act passed by the US Congress last year does not matter where its prescriptive provisions apply to New Delhi.

 The draft just discussed in Delhi is in a sense a rolling draft because it is being constantly revised with new ideas and compromises, which the Americans called work (that) remains to be done and foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon described as a gap.

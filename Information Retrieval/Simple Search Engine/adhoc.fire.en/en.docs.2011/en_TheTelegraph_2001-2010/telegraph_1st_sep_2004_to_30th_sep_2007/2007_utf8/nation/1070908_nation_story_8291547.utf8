 Rape-tainted sadhus on the run

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, Sept. 7: Five sadhus have gone into hiding after being accused of abducting and raping a woman over four months.

 The case came to light after Sabjibhai, the father of the 21-year-old victim, lodged a complaint with Amreli police. Since she went missing, Sabjibhai had presumed his daughter had eloped with a lover he had not been told of.

 But a month ago, she returned home appearing traumatised, and told her father that she had been abducted and raped by six persons, including the five sadhus from a Swaminarayan temple of the Vadtal sect, in shrines and other places in Ahmedabad and Jaipur. 

 Amreli police superintendent Sandip Singh said he had received the complaint from the victim. I have ordered an inquiry and I am likely to get the report by tomorrow. 

 The sadhus have been in hiding since September 1, the day the victim went to the police with her complaint. 

 But R. Khanduria, the inspector carrying out the investigation, said several questions have been left unanswered. As a police officer, I cannot say anything conclusively until I have completed the inquiry. 

 The woman has told the police that Mansukh Vaghela, who was known to her, offered her a lift while she was waiting for a bus at Amrelis Gigasan village to travel to a relatives place for a family function four months ago.

 During the journey, Mansukh gave her spiked soda water that left her unconscious. When she regained her senses, she found herself in the Swaminarayan temple at Panchala village, about 25km from Junagadhs Keshod town.

 The woman realised she had been abducted but Mansukh threatened her with dire consequences if she did not take orders. She was later shifted to other places, where the accused raped her repeatedly, the police said.

 Before she came home, she was dropped at Mav Jinjva, not far from her own village. 

 Investigators are finding out why Sabjibhai didnt lodge a complaint after his daughter went missing, and why the victim approached the police a month after her abductors released her.

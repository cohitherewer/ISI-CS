 Badal sworn in, along with family

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Chandigarh, March 2: Its all in the family for Parkash Singh Badal. Four relatives were made ministers as the 80-year-old Shiromani Akali Dal chief was sworn in as Punjabs chief minister for the fourth time. 

 Nephew Manpreet, son-in-law Adesh Pratap Singh Kairon and son Sukhbirs brother-in-law Bikramjit Singh Majithia took their oath as ministers, as did Janmeja Singh Sekhon, a relative of Badals younger brother Gurdas, who lost the polls. Governor S.F. Rodrigues administered the oath of office and secrecy to the 18-member council of ministers, which included five from the BJP, before a noisy audience of 50,000 supporters. 

 BJP president Rajnath Singh, Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia, Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, L.K. Advani and Sahib Singh Varma were present at the ceremony, held at the Punjab Cricket Association stadium. Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah also put in an appearance, along with son Omar, as did Janata Dal (United) leader George Fernandes and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar. 

 Badal stressed he wouldnt pursue the policy of vendetta similar to what had been unleashed against his party members by his predecessor Amarinder Singh. I hold nothing against anyone in my heart. The people have voted for us because they were reeling under a repressive and dictatorial regime, he said.

 However, Badal did say mega projects malls, multiplexes and ritzy colonies would be reviewed. We will look into everything done by the Congress government that made the common man suffer, he said. 

 Tomorrow, the chief minister will travel to the Golden Temple in Amritsar.

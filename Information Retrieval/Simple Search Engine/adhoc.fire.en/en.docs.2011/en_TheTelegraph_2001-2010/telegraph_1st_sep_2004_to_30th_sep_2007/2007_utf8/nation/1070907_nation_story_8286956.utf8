 Mumbai, Sept. 6: Alistair Perreira, who drove his Toyota Corolla over seven persons sleeping on a Bandra pavement and crushed them to death after a night out drinking, has been sent to jail.

 Finding him guilty of culpable homicide, Bombay High Court today handed the 21-year-old a three-year jail term and adjourned hearing on the bail application till November 8.

 There is no cause for uncalled sympathy for Alistair who showed a callous attitude and was most irresponsible, the judges said, pulling up the lower court that had sentenced him to six months for rash driving.

 A surprised Perreira, who the court said had shown no remorse, was taken into police custody immediately after the verdict.

 This is yet another example of the Indian judiciary proving that the law is the same for one and all, said Debjyoti Talukdar of a Pune NGO that supported the witnesses and prosecution lawyers.

 The mild sentence handed by the lower court in April was met with outrage, and glaring lapses by police came under scrutiny.

 Two of Perreiras victims were children, aged seven and nine, and one was a pregnant woman. All the adults killed were construction workers. 

 The court rejected the defence plea that the cars engine had failed. He drove in a reckless manner being aware of his obligation towards the safety of persons sleeping on the footpath, the judge said, pointing out that the victims were not sleeping on the pavement by choice.

 Perreira, who did not have to go to jail after the April sentence as he was granted bail, was also fined Rs 5 lakh.

 Last November, the 21-year-old was driving back with five friends after a Sunday night binge at a five-star hotel when he rode onto the pavement, crushing the seven. Three of his friends fled the spot while two stood with Perreira threatening relatives of the victims, an eyewitness said.

 The police forgot to conduct a breathalyser test. No blood or urine reports were submitted in court to prove Perreira was drunk when he was speeding and he was let off with the minor charge of rash driving.

 The judges today castigated the lower court for ignoring material evidence. 

 The witnesses poor construction labourers from Andhra Pradesh had stood their ground, helping to nail Perreira.

 His father, businessman Antony Perreira, blamed his lawyer and called him incompetent. 

 We will appeal in the Supreme Court, he said.

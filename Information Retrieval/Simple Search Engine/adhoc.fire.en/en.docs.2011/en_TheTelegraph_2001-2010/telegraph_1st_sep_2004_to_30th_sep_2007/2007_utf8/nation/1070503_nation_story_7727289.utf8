 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, May 2: Accused of harassing an Indian businessman through corrupt means, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence will for the first time have to lay its documents open for public scrutiny under the Right to Information Act. 

 On May 30, the Central Information Commission (CIC) will inspect correspondence between Russian customs officials and the Indian embassy in Moscow. This is believed to be critical in clinching the suspect role of the directorate, which monitors international economic transactions. 

 Intelligence agencies are exempt from the RTI Act except in cases which the CIC believes could involve corruption or human rights violation. The directorate has been found suspect on both charges.

 This is the first time since the act came into being in 2005 that we have been asked to provide information. We are still trying to prepare a response, Ajay Jain, chief public information officer of the directorate, said. 

 Rajeev Verma, a Delhi-based exporter who regularly sent consignments to Russia, was charged by the directorate in December 2004 with violating export regulations. 

 The showcause served on him claimed that the firms he was exporting goods to either did not exist or werent involved in any import operation.

 When Verma cited the RTI act, he was provided with two letters by the foreign ministry correspondence between the ministry and the directorate which the CIC has found self-contradictory. 

 Also, the letters do not in any way substantiate the allegations. When we ask the DRI or the MEA, they have no clear substance to their allegations either. It is all rather suspicious, a CIC source said. 

 An official in the commission said it appears to be a clear case of corruption followed by harassment and humiliation of an Indian citizen for no fault of his.

 He added that many documents that the CIC wants to see are with the Indian embassy in Russia or with Russian customs officials. The foreign ministry has been asked to get them.

 Gandhi on lips, Sonia set for UN

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 In the Mahatmas shadow

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: Sonia Gandhi is aiming for a high-profile international debut at the plenary session of the UN General Assembly on October 2 by restaking her claim to the Mahatmas legacy.

 Its all very hush-hush, but her party and the foreign ministry are furiously working towards creating a perfect constellation of stars for the Congress president.

 For a start, India persuaded a record 142 countries to co-sponsor a resolution in June proposing that October 2, Mahatma Gandhis birthday, be named International Non-Violence Day.

 Foreign ministry sources said the Satyagraha Conference, organised by the Congress in January to commemorate 100 years of the launch of satyagraha as an instrument of non-violence, had pushed for international status for October 2.

 So Sonia, possibly accompanied by son Rahul and key members of the Congress, will speak at the UN in New York on October 2.

 Her possessive feelings about Gandhis legacy will be underlined with a trip to South Africa this month.

 Mixing memory and contemporary politics, she will address a Cape Town think-tank as well as visit the major sites associated with Gandhi, such as Durban, Phoenix and Johannesburg. 

 Sonia will meet Nelson Mandela and is likely to go to Robben Island, where he spent 26 years in jail. She will also visit the headquarters of the African National Congress in Johannesburg.

 The Congress presidents desire to speak at the General Assembly has, however, thrown a spanner in Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs schedule at the UN.

 Indias turn to speak at the UN is on September 28, which is much too close to October 2.

 South Block will also decide this week whether Singh will make a flying visit to US President George W. Bushs ranch in Crawford, Texas, in early September in a thanksgiving tour for pushing the Indo-American nuclear deal.

 If he does go to Crawford despite Left pressure, the Prime Minister might skip the General Assembly altogether. If he does not go to meet Bush, he and Sonia may well be in New York in consecutive weeks.

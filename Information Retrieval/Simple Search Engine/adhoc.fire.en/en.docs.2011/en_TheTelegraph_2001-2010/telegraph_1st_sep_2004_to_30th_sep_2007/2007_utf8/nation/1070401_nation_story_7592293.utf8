 Naxalite fire

 Midnapore, March 31: A day after killing two CPM leaders at Belpahari in Bengals Maoist heartland, extremists set ablaze two trucks ferrying logs from Lalgarh forest, reports our correspondent. 

 Police said some six Naxalites intercepted the trucks while they were on the way to a depot, about 70 km from the scene of yesterdays strike.

 West Midnapore police chief R. Rajsekharan said the Jharkhand Party (Aditya Kisku), which is in alliance with the CPM in the panchayat, hired Maoists for yesterdays strike. 

 The administration had replaced a Jharkhand Party leader with a CPM one at the helm after the former was charged with swindling funds.

 Talks reach end of road

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, June 1: Hopes for an end to the crisis sparked by Tuesdays police firing on Gujjars receded further as talks between the government and the protesting community collapsed amid fresh violence. 

 This is the end of the talks, at least for now. We have given the government ample chance to prove their sincerity. So far the talks have failed and we will go back to protesting, Gujjar leader Kirori Singh Baisna said this evening. 

 On the streets, the Gujjars clashed with members of the Meena community by evening, the death toll in the days violence had reached five, and over 40 are believed to be injured. 

 The fourth round of talks were held in Jaipur unlike yesterdays three rounds in Dausa, a Gujjar stronghold. 

 We agreed to meet the government in Jaipur, even though they should be coming to us. Yet the government is adamant, said Baisna. 

 Government officials, however, blamed the failure of the talks on the unrealistic demands of the Gujjars. 

 They want us to accept all their demands before they clear the roads and allow the administration in again. Which administration will agree to such a demand? asked a bureaucrat representing the government. They stop the violence and we will consider each of their demands. 

 The Gujjars want the government to ask the Centre to grant Scheduled Tribe status to them. They also want a CBI probe into Tuesdays firing. 

 In Delhi, BJP chief Rajnath Singh told Gujjar leaders: I am in constant touch with the Rajasthan chief minister. You (Gujjar leaders) have to help us restore peace before we discuss anything else.

 The Union home ministry has advised the state to prevent the communities from getting into a confrontation mode against each other. 

 The state can attempt this by talking to the leaders of the two communities down to the district and panchayat level, said a senior ministry official.

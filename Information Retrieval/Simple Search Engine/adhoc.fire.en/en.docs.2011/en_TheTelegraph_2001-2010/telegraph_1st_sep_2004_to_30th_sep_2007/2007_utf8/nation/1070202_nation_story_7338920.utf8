 Bottled: the tangy scent of saucy seaside

 Biologist Andrew Johnston: Pinpointing the gene 

 New Delhi, Feb. 1: Scientists have bottled the smell of the seaside near the British village of Stiffkey, once the home of a controversial preacher who was defrocked because of his alleged licentious lifestyle.

 Biologists at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, have put Stiffkey on the science map by discovering the gene that helps produce dimethyl sulfide (DMS), the tangy, sharp gas that gives the seaside its typical smell.

 Andrew Johnston and his colleagues detected the gene in a bacteria called Marinomonas found around the roots of a grass in a coastal salt marsh near Stiffkey in eastern England.

 The scientists then used genetic engineering to coax another bacteria to produce the gas in the laboratory, and filled it into test tubes and tiny bottles. Their findings will appear in tomorrows issue of the US journal Science.

 The gas concentrated in bottles smells rather unpleasant, the scientists said. The bacteria do make large amounts of the gas, but were not going to become rich, Johnston told The Telegraph.

 Although DMS has been known for more than 30 years, no one had until now pinpointed the gene responsible for its production. The synthesis of DMS is a very important process in the environment, Johnston said.

 Microbes which live near marine plants and organisms along the worlds coasts and salt marshes produce millions of tonnes of DMS. Researchers believe the smell of DMS even at low concentrations allows some sea birds to sniff out the location of marine plants for food. The gas also plays a role in the formation of clouds over the oceans, according to environmental scientists. 

 University of East Anglia officials have said the discovery adds an element of science to Stiffkeys previous and rather diverse reasons for fame. The coastal village was the home of the late prolific British author Henry Williamson who wrote Tarka the Otter in 1927 and died in 1977 by coincidence on the very day that a film crew was shooting the death of Tarka.

 The history of Stiffkey also includes a controversial rector who was defrocked stripped of his right to preach by the church in 1932 for his alleged involvement with prostitutes. The rector, who had been labelled The Prostitutes Padre, later joined a circus where, according to 1930s newspaper clips, he used to enter a lions cage, playing the biblical Daniel in a bid to assert his innocence.

 However, the preacher, who maintained that he had been framed, died in July 1937 two days after he was mauled by a lion during one of his sessions inside the cage.

 The site where biologist Johnston picked up the DMS-making bacteria is a salt marsh north of Stiffkey. The scientists said the starting point for DMS is another molecule called DMSP, which is used by many different marine plants as a stress protectant. When the plants die, some species of bacteria consume the DMSP as food and liberate the DMS gas. 

 The researchers said it is possible other plants found in mangrove regions of the tropics may also produce DMSP. Mangroves can give off the same DMS gas that gives off the seaside smell, he said.

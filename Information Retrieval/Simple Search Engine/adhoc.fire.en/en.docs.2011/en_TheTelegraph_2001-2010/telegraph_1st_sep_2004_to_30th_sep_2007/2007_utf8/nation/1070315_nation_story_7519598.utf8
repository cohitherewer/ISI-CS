 Reluctant son on BJP list

 New Delhi, March 14: The BJP tonight declared a list of 316 candidates for the Uttar Pradesh elections next month, says our special correspondent.

 All 73 sitting MLAs have been given tickets. BJP president Rajnath Singhs son Amit Singh was cleared as the candidate from Chiraigaon in Mirzapur by the partys election committee, but he refused to contest.

 Kalyan Singh, the chief ministerial candidate, is also not in the fray. In all, 403 seats are up for grabs in the polls.

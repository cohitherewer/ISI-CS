 Glare on creamy layer 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 6: A UPA meeting convened by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today discussed the possibility of excluding the creamy layer from the higher education quota.

 The government feels that such a concession would stand it in good stead when the Supreme Court is approached to lift the stay on the introduction of OBC quotas this year.

 If the creamy layer (the better-off) is kept out of the education quota, the government can submit before the court that parity has been restored with reservation in jobs where the affluent cannot claim the benefit.

 At the coordination committee meeting this evening, Union law minister H.R. Bhardwaj is believed to have suggested that excluding the creamy layer could be a credible solution to end the legal impasse.

 The court had raised two issues on the quota controversy. First, the 1931 census on the basis of which the OBC quota was quantified at 27 per cent is too old. Second, the creamy layer among the OBCs should be kept out.

 Political parties are not in favour of a fresh census as an immediate solution because the process will take at least five to six years.

 This is not the first time Bhardwaj has suggested leaving the creamy layer out of the quota. But the human resource development ministry the prime mover of the quota legislation has held its ground against the suggestion. 

 The UPAs southern allies and Ram Vilas Paswan are also opposed to excluding the creamy layer. Keeping out the rich, however, finds favour with the CPM and a section of the Congress.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Pat for Speaker in fight to tame MPs

 - Public backs discipline drive

 Chatterjee: Popular support

 MPs browbeat Somnath Chatterjee when he suggested a fine on those who disrupt Parliament, but many among the public could be behind him.

 The Lok Sabha Speakers office has been flooded with letters congratulating him over his no work, no pay proposal that was thrown out by an all-party meeting in August, sources said.

 Dinesh M. Shah from Vadodara says he was elated at the suggestion and was disappointed when it was rejected.

 Arvind R. Doshi of Mumbai has written to say that 90 per cent of voters backed the Speakers proposal in an opinion poll carried out by a leading Marathi daily. Doshi added his own suggestion: if an MP dies, the Houses should adjourn for about half an hour and then get back to work.

 The Speaker has backing on the streets, too. Social activists and students will hold silent protests across the country on Monday against the frequent disruptions of Parliament that are delaying legislative business.

 The public support extends to Chatterjees attempts to enforce discipline through threats and expulsions. The Speaker had had an MP evicted during the monsoon session and thundered at another: Daily, I will send somebody out.

 One of the letter writers, Manohar Lal Gupta of the Sanatan Dharma Sabha of Bhatinda, has advised the Speaker to use the services of marshals more regularly to quell unruly MPs.

 The August 23 all-party meeting had dismissed a second proposal: a five-day suspension for anyone invading the well of the House. Chatterjee was rudely told it was he and not the unruly members who were lowering the image of Parliament.

 You speak so much, you lose your temper so often, you rebuke us at the slightest provocation, you paint everybody black, the Samajwadi Partys Mohan Singh had said.

 Cornered, with not even his party members supporting him, Chatterjee had conceded that he was perhaps getting agitated too soon and requested the floor leaders to point it out to him if he overstepped his brief.

 Swami Agnivesh, who will be leading Mondays protests in Delhi along with journalist Kuldeep Nayar and former Delhi High Court Chief Justice Rajinder Sachar, had no doubt who was guilty of overstepping.

 The people of India feel disgraced by the frequent disruptions of Parliament. A days disruption costs the exchequer Rs 90 lakh and legislation like the one on unorganised labourers is getting delayed, he said.

 The all-party meeting made two concessions. One, it agreed that question hour should not be disrupted barring exceptional circumstances. Two, it accepted the suggestion that the House should have at least 100 sittings a year.

 Such promises in the past, however, have borne little fruit. The special Lok Sabha session in 1997, held to mark the golden jubilee of Independence, had unanimously passed a resolution not to disrupt question hour or rush to the well.

 Question hour, the prime time for members to seek information and ensure the accountability of the government, however, continues to be derailed for days together.

 A meeting in 2004, too, had pledged to strive to uphold the decorum of the House. But as the Lok Sabha repeatedly descended into chaos over the nuclear deal, Chatterjee told the MPs that even children were more disciplined.

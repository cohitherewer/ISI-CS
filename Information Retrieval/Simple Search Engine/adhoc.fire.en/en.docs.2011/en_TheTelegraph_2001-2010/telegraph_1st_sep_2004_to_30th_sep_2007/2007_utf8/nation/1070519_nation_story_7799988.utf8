 Mecca Masjid in Hyderabad

 Hyderabad, May 18: As many as 8,000 masons and 27,000 labourers toiled for 77 years to build Mecca Masjid.

 Consider a comparison: the Taj Mahal is reported to have been built by 20,000 labourers over 20 years.

 Mecca Masjid took more resources and time probably because the granite and the mud for the bricks came from the Arabian holy land that gave the place of worship its name.

 It is said that each of the two octagonal columns on either side of the hall was made from a single piece of granite that took five years to quarry. The mosque has a courtyard and a large pond flanked by slab seats. 

 Todays blast damaged the pond and it may not be able to store water for the use of worshippers for a while perhaps for the first time in the last 100 years. The mosque is a listed heritage building but it is under the control of the wakf board. It was given a chemical wash in 1995.

 The prayers at the mosque were considered a sensitive event since the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992. Police take extraordinary precautions every Friday. Paramilitary forces, armed with water cannons, keep watch till noon near Charminar. Pickets are put up and movement of vehicles is closely monitored.

 When N. Chandrababu Naidu was chief minister, the police had surrounded the mosque on one December 6 following a tip-off that some mischief-makers had taken shelter there. The then director-general of police, P. Ramulu, had caused an uproar by entering the mosque without removing his shoes. The officer later apologised.

 Tension had begun rising around the mosque since the late eighties. In 1990, over 60 people died in clashes that erupted over a Ganesh procession. Since then, the procession is postponed to the afternoon if the immersion day happens to be a Friday.

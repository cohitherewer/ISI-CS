The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Focus on VP purse, Patil past 

 Wife much richer than Shekhawat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 13: Bhairon 

 Singh Shekhawat isnt exactly a poor man with 

 Rs 27 lakh in his kitty. But at Rs 2.4 crore, his wife Suraj 

 Kanwar is nearly 10 times richer.

 The figures were trotted out by his spokesperson, Sushma Swaraj. Although the BJP has asked for the assets of the presidential contenders to be made public, the law doesnt really require these disclosures to be made.

 Sushma said the assets were being declared to uphold the principles of probity in public life and the right to information of electors. 

 Shekhawat decided to make his wealth public soon after leader of Opposition L.K. Advani urged the Election Commission to ask presidential candidates to disclose their assets. 

 But the panel turned down the request, saying it was not empowered to deal with the issue. 

 The Congress sought to play down the gesture, dubbing the declaration a laughable move and an act of melodrama and farce. 

 There is no legal and constitutional requirement for presidential candidates to declare assets, party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said.

 Instead, the BJP should explain why it did not pass a law making such a declaration mandatory when the NDA was in power, Singhvi said. The returning officer will not accept any declaration that is not legally required.

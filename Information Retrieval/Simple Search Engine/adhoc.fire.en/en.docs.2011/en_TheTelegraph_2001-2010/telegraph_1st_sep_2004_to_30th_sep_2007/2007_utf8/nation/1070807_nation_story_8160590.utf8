 Priya prod works, not lawyer leash

 Diya Mirza, Farhan Akhtar, John Abraham: Speaking up 

 Mumbai, Aug. 6: Bollywood feels special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam has no business threatening the industry for standing by Sanjay Dutt. And legal experts said there was little substance to Nikams threat of a contempt case against those who had signed an online petition for the actors release.

 Anyone can support a campaign for Sanjays release. Only if people start condemning the judge or the legal procedures can action be taken, said advocate Farhana Shah.

 Sanjay is not a criminal and doesnt need to be reformed, said director Farhan Akhtar. He has already spent several months in jail for his recklessness and has since lived as a decent, secular, law-abiding citizen. I do hope the Supreme Court handles his case with more sensitivity.

 The film industry, however, has dropped plans for a protest in the real world for now following a carefully worded appeal by Sanjays sister and MP Priya Dutt, who asked for the law to be allowed to take its own course.

 I, on behalf of the Dutt family would like to thank all the people who have shown their overwhelming support for our brother Sanjay. It has come as a great pillar of strength in this hour of need, she said.

 However, as sad as it is, we must realise that as on date, Sanjay has been convicted. The family although greatly saddened by the judgment has accepted it with a heavy heart. We have full faith in the judicial system of our country and are currently pursuing all legal remedies available to him. 

 We humbly request you as his supporters to pray for us from your heart and mind and let the law takes it own course. 

 The three-day virtual protest, however, marches on. The Support Sanjay Dutt petition at www.petitiononline.com, which is to be sent to President Pratibha Patil, had gathered 1,615 signatures from fans and colleagues by 8pm today. 

 Shah Rukh Khan, Bobby Deol, John Abraham, Diya Mirza and Farhan Akhtar are signatories, sources said.

 A city-based human rights activist and lawyer, Aseem Sarode, objected to Nikams statement, saying it goes against Article 19 of the Constitution that guarantees the right to freedom of expression.

 How do we calculate the mental punishment for the last 13 years (of the trial)? Shouldnt that be deducted from Sanjays sentence? said Rajkumar Hirani who directed the Munnabhai films.

 A second campaign for Sanjays release was to start today with Shah Rukh and Suniel Shetty asking the industry to gather at a hotel. Priyas appeal has put the protest on hold.

 Yes, the event was planned; we received a message about it. But it was called off and we havent got any new dates, said Rajkumar Tiwari, secretary to actors Riteish Deshmukh, Fardeen Khan and Zayed Khan. 

 Nikam, however, stood his ground. These campaigns create doubts in the minds of the common man (about) the judiciary being erroneous in its judgment, he said. I will take legal recourse if I deem it necessary, he said.

 Internet protest, however, isnt confined to the petition. Orkut, the social networking site of Google, has spawned a host of pro-Sanjay communities such as We Love You Sanju, We Pray for You, I Support Sanju Baba, Sanjay Dutt Is Innocent and Please Forgive Sanjay Dutt.

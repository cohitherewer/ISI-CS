 No unions, says Infosys

 Thiruvananthapuram, July 2 (PTI): The man who heads one of Indias largest infotech companies believes the sunrise sector is better off without unions at this point of time.

 There will be a change in the perception and image of the industry if unions are introduced, said Infosys Technologies CEO and managing director Kris Gopalakrishnan.

 Gopalakrishnan said employees in the sector were well paid and happy. Whats the reason for trade unions now? We must seriously consider whether it is the right time to have unions. It might hurt the industry, he said.

 The problems in the industry should be addressed through discussions, he said, adding the associations of companies should take the initiative to push the process.

 According to Gopalakrishnan, the IT sector employs about a million people and is generating two to three lakh jobs every year. 

 Most of these jobs are very well paid and very attractive, he said.

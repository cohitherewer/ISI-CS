 Terai glare on RSS

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, Feb. 1: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is believed to be lending a hand to monarchists in Nepal who have now officially been blamed for provoking sectarian violence in the countrys southern plains.

 Sources said senior Sangh office-bearer Suresh Soni recently met Upendra Yadav, a former Maoist who has sided with the royalists and is now at the forefront of the movement for the rights of the Madhesis of the Terai plains.

 Yadav heads the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum that is said to be working together with the royalist Sadhbhavna Party.

 Soni reportedly met Yadav and several Sadbhavna Party (Badri-Mandal) members on the sidelines of a conference organised in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, on December 19.

 The Sangh doesnt deny the meeting, but a senior pracharak said the organisation no longer wants to be associated with the political process in Nepal.

 The view that we support the King has gained ground because of the pronouncements of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (a sister organisation). But let me make it clear to you: we have nothing to do with the political developments in Nepal, the pracharak said.

 We want the Hindu culture and traditions to be respected and preserved in Nepal. Besides that, we are not involved. I am not saying anything about who met whom but it is wrong to conclude that we are fomenting trouble in Terai.

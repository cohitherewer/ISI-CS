 Parking rap 

 New Delhi, April 23 (PTI): A Delhi municipal corporation parking attendant who took someone elses car for a joyride has been convicted of criminal breach of trust by a court in a six-year-old case.

 The parking attendant was duty-bound to look after the car and not to allow anyone to carry it away but he failed to fulfil his obligation, metropolitan magistrate Ajay Goel said.

 Lalit Kumar, 25, had taken the vehicle for his own use without informing the owner. He has been released on probation for a year in view of his age and clean past.

 The magistrate noted that by not keeping the car safe, Kumar had dishonestly violated owner K.K. Aroras trust. He had also failed to return to Arora the vehicle, which was later recovered by police. 

 Dismissing the defence plea that Kumar was falsely implicated, the court termed the complainants deposition trustworthy and unequivocal. 

 The offence is more of negligence rather than intention and the ends of justice would be met if Kumar is given benefit of probation, the court said. It asked him to furnish a bond of Rs 5,000.

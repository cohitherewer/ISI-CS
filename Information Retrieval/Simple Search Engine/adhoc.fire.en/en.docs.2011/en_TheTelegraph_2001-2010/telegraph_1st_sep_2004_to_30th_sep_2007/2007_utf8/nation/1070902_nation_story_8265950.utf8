 New Delhi, Sept. 1: India should use the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal only to import uranium for its own home-grown reactors and avoid buying foreign reactors whose electricity may be unaffordable, an energy expert said today. 

 Calculations indicate that the cost of electricity from imported reactors may range between Rs 4 and Rs 5 per unit (kWh), which is higher than what is now seen as an acceptable Rs 2 to Rs 3 per unit, said Sudha Mahalingam, an energy economist and a member of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board. 

 Her analysis is based on the assumption that the cost of a foreign nuclear reactor would be about Rs 10 crore per MW of installed capacity, she said. Reactors from France, Russia and the US have capacities of 1,000MW to 1,600MW. 

 If and when the deal is completed, India will have the options of purchasing nuclear reactors as well as buying uranium fuel for its indigenous reactors which, said Nuclear Power Corporation officials, cost about Rs 6 crore per MW. 

 Without imported reactors, well have a relatively modest growth of nuclear power, but with imported reactors, we may witness Enron-type situations, Mahalingam said at a talk delivered at an international conference on the Indo-US nuclear deal here. 

 After Enron had built its 2,100MW gas-fired plant in Maharashtra, the state refused to buy electricity from it on the grounds that it was too expensive. But under Indias two-part power tariff system introduced in 1992, the electricity board was expected to continue paying the company a fixed cost even if it did not purchase a single unit, she said. 

 Mahalingam said it is still unclear if India will be allowed to exclusively import uranium and turn down offers of nuclear reactors.

 Its a very good deal if we can use it only to import uranium, she said. We can go on building our indigenous reactors and we can move towards the fast breeder programme. 

 A senior nuclear scientist said while the indigenous reactors are not inferior in any way, the largest Indian-made reactor is rated for 540MW. There are plans to build a 700MW reactor, but foreign reactors will be larger.

 Easier UK entry 

 Mumbai, Jan. 15 (PTI): British high commissioner Michael Arthur today said his country was taking steps to make it easy for Indian students to gain entry into the UK.

 There are 22,000 Indian students studying in the UK. About five years ago the number was only 5,000, Arthur said, while speaking to journalists on the sidelines of a seminar organised jointly by the Bombay Chamber of Commerce and Industry and British Business Group.

 We are making it easy for Indian students to come in (to the UK), he said. There were presently 500 Indian companies which have set up base in Britain, Arthur added.

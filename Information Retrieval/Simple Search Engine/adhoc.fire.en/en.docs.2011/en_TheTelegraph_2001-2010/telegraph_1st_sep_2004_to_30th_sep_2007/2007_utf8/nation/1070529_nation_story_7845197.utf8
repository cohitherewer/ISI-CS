 Blackmail cuffs on IITian in US

 New Delhi, May 28 (PTI): An Indian-born IITian, Rajadata A. Patkar, has been arrested by the FBI for allegedly blackmailing a top US official over a sexual exploitation row.

 Rajadata has been in custody of US police since March 3 for allegedly blackmailing Bob Awana the secretary to the governor of Hawaii over the officials alleged sexual exploitation of Jullie Mae, a Philippine national and the accuseds girlfriend.

 Rajadata, says his family, was also the Japanese interpreter for late former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.

 The allegation was that while working in Tokyo, Rajadata hacked into his girlfriends email from which he learnt of her alleged sexual exploitation by the US official. Subsequently, it was alleged that Rajadata started blackmailing Awana and reportedly pocketed about $4,000 dollars, a charge that he has denied.

 In a habeas corpus petition filed before the Supreme Court on Monday, Rajadatas mother Snehalata Patkar sought production of her son in India. She said her sons arrest by US police on false charges was illegal and Rajadata being an Indian citizen can be tried only here for the alleged offence.

 A bench of Justices Arijit Pasayat and D.K. Jain, however, rejected the petition saying it cannot give any directives to the US administration.

 New Delhi, Feb. 12: A World Bank-appointed neutral expert today cleared the Baglihar power project in Jammu and Kashmir but told Delhi to reduce the dam height by 1.5 metres.

 Both India and Pakistan are seeing the verdict as their own victory. Pakistan claimed the report was a victory as three of its proposals, including the one on reducing the dam height had been accepted. 

 The neutral experts verdict is binding, Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tasnim Aslam said as Raymond Lafitte released his final determination on the project to diplomats from both sides in Switzerland.

 In Jammu and Kashmir, where the project would generate 450 mw power, state power minister Nawang Ringzin Jora said: We welcome these suggestions and the verdict will not affect the power generation. 

 The reduction in height will have no impact on power generation, water resources minister Saifuddin Soz, too, said. 

 Although Pakistan claimed three of its proposals had been accepted, Soz said the expert has rejected most of the objections raised by Pakistan and has broadly gone in Indias favour.

 The World Bank expert explained that the height of the dam should be reduced by 1.5 metres to conform to the International Commission of Large Dams. The total height is proposed to be 144.5 metres.

 Both India and Pakistan were awaiting the decision keenly as the dam had been a bone of contention for over two decades. 

 In 2005, Pakistan had sought intervention of the World Bank, which is the third party to the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, alleging that construction violated the accord.

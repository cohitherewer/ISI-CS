 Khadim accused in Lucknow net

 Khadims co-owner Parthapratim Roy Burman

 Lucknow/Calcutta, June 23: A key accused in the Khadims abduction was arrested after a chase in Lucknow this morning, with the police touting him as a top militant linked to last months Mecca Masjid blasts.

 Jalaluddin, from Jainagar in South 24-Parganas, is alleged to be the India commander of the Bangladesh-based Harkat-ul Jehad al Islami, blamed for a series of recent strikes, including the March 2006 Varanasi blasts.

 He and an associate, Mohammad Naushad, were challenged at the Wazirganj locality around 6.30 pm as they were walking beside a rickshaw carrying a load of hand grenades, Uttar Pradesh police said.

 The two of them started running and entered a house, but once they realised they had no hope they surrendered, a special task force (STF) source said.

 Officers in Calcutta said Jalaluddin was a key player in the July 2001 kidnapping of Khadims co-owner Parthapratim Roy Burman.

 He had arranged the house in North 24-Parganas Haroa, where the hostage was held from July 25 till his ransom was paid on August 2. He later kept guard as team leader, a senior officer said.

 He figures on the charge-sheet as one of the seven accused absconding. The name we have is Amar, alias Jallal Molla.

 The officer said that a few weeks ago, Bengal sleuths had learnt that Jalaluddin had arrived in Calcutta and boarded the Himgiri Express from Howrah to Lucknow. The Uttar Pradesh police were tipped off.

 The STF seized 9 kg of RDX, an AK-47, a Chinese-made pistol and 20 hand grenades from the rickshaw and the two militants.

 Jalaluddin, who also went by the names of Babu Bhai and Amanullah Mondal, has confessed that Harkats India module has 150 trained operatives, Uttar Pradesh police chief G.L. Sharma said. They have so far imported 100 kg of RDX, with Naushad in charge of its upkeep.

 Sharma said Jalaluddin, who is in his early 30s, became Harkats top commander in India after his predecessor, Muhammad Hashim Qadir alias Arif, was killed in Kashmir in 2005. He is believed to have been behind the July 2005 Shramjeevi Express blast that killed 10 people.

 The outfit is the prime suspect in last months Mecca Masjid blasts in Hyderabad.

 Jalaluddin, a farmers son from Majilpur village, block Bhilpara, had begun as a petty criminal who later joined Dawood Ibrahims gang, police sources said.

 He was arrested in Delhi in October 2001 in the Khadims case. He had given his name as Abdul Rashid, an officer said in Lucknow.

 He was brought to Bengal but soon broke jail and fled to Dhaka where he came into contact with militants in 2002. He has admitted receiving arms training in Pakistans Baluchistan and Kotli.

 Jalaluddins name had cropped up on Thursday after two Harkat militants, Mohammad Yakub and Nasir Ahmad, were arrested in Lucknow with 7 kg of RDX.

 Mumbai university bourse plan runs into govt wall

 Mumbai University

 New Delhi, April 11: Whats 

 sauce for the union isnt sauce for the varsity at 

 least thats what the Centre seems to believe.

 At a time the government is trying to convince unions to allow investment of pension funds in the market, the human resource development ministry is opposing Mumbai Universitys move to invest in the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 The cash-starved university wants to maximise resources by investing in stocks, but the Centre says the move is unprecedented and it cant allow any public institution funded by the government to trade shares in the market. 

 The ministry, headed by Arjun Singh, says it would amount to commercialisation of education and might set a trend that, in the long run, would destroy the foundation of public institutions. A time may come when, ministry officials say, any private agency can buy up universities.

 The ministry has sought clarifications from the university on the proposal and so has the University Grants Commission.

 The university, however, has an ally in the National Knowledge Commission. In its latest report on higher education submitted to the Prime Minister, the commission said: These laws (tax and trust laws) should be changed so that universities can invest in financial instruments of their choice and use the income from their endowments to build a corpus.

 The commission underlined the need to explore other possibilities of revenue to meet fresh challenges. It is essential to stimulate private investment in education as a means of extending educational opportunities, it said.

 Despite the Centres reluctance, the university is going ahead with its Rs 2-lakh feasibility study on the proposed listing and has asked the senate to sanction the amount. University authorities are quoting the examples of China and Korea where institutes of learning are allowed to invest in stocks.

 Universities trading in the stock market is not new in Asia. The practice is in vogue in Korea and China. We are only following a trend begun by the Peking, Li Jiyang and Korea Universities, vice-chancellor Vijay Khole had said last month. Several universities in the UK, Australia and China have their shares traded on the US Nasdaq.

 The move has come at a time when universities are facing a genuine cash crunch, a situation aggravated by the 27 per cent quota for OBCs, expected to come into effect from the academic session beginning this year.

 Mumbai University says its kitty of Rs 250 crore from the state and central governments will not be enough to meet the demands of new infrastructure, more teachers and new centres.

 For the ministry, however, it is a question of principle. It is also against raising tuition fees.

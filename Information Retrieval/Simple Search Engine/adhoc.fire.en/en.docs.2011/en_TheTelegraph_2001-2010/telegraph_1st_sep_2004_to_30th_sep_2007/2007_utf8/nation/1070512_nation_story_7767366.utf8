 Nod to Antarctic station

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 11: Members of the Antarctic Treaty System have approved Indias proposal to set up a second permanent station in Antarctica and decided to impose restraints on tourism to the ice continent.

 The 30th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Committee Meeting concluded here today after endorsing Indias proposal for a new research base at Larsemann Hills, about 2,000 km east of Maitreyi, Indias permanent station.

 The new base will be designed to house 15 scientists through the year and an additional 10 scientists during the Antarctic summer. With the meetings approval, Indian officials will now ask the government for funds to build the station that is expected to cost around Rs 40 crore.

 The project could be ready for operation in about three years, said Rasik Ravindra, director of the National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research in Goa.

 India considers the Larsemann Hills site significant as it is in a region that was connected to India millions of years ago . It is also on the coast unlike Maitreyi, which is about 100 km from the sea.

 The world has also moved on restraining tourism through this meeting, Ravindra said. A working group has recommended that countries should discourage or decline to authorise tour operators using vessels with more than 500 passengers from landing on Antarctica.

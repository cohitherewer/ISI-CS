 Funds-for-kids call to PM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 9: Academics, rights activists, nutritionists and a member of the National Advisory Council (NAC) have urged Manmohan Singh to intervene and ensure that children get a fairer deal in the Union budget as well as the 11th five-year plan.

 A letter signed by Jean Dreze, academic and co-author of several books with Amartya Sen, N.C. Saxena, a NAC member and former bureaucrat, Harsh Mander of the Centre for Equity Studies and RTI campaigner Aruna Roy among others was sent to the Prime Minister today.

 It brings into focus that in the current budget, the government will be spending less than Rs 5,000 crore this year on children under six, who constitute more than 15 per cent of Indias population.

 The petitioners reminded Singh of a meeting some of them had with him on December 19. At the meet, which discussed a report on children under six and a Supreme Court ruling of December 13, 2006, (directing the Centre to give a time frame for the universalisation of the Integrated Child Development Scheme), they were assured of the UPAs commitment to the objective, enshrined in the common minimum programme.

 We are, therefore, startled and dismayed that this commitment is not reflected at all in the Union budget. The allocation for ICDS (Rs 4,761 crore) has barely increased in real terms and is virtually unchanged as a proportion of the GDP, says the letter.

 The group adds that based on fairly conservative calculations of the requirements of universalisation with quality, the NAC had recommended in November 2004 an allocation of at least Rs 9,600 crore for ICDS in 2007-08. 

 This figure needs upward revision in the light of the Supreme Court judgment, yet the actual provision is not even half of this conservative estimate, the letter stresses.

 Against the Rs 5,000 crore allocated for children under six, they said Rs 96,000 crore would be spent on defence. 

 This is a staggering and unacceptable imbalance in budget priorities. The contrast is all the more shocking at a time of growing evidence (particularly from the National Family Health Survey) that there has been no substantial improvement in infant and young child nutrition... in spite of runaway economic growth.

 Copies of the letter have been sent to Sonia, finance minister P. Chidambaram and deputy chairman of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia.

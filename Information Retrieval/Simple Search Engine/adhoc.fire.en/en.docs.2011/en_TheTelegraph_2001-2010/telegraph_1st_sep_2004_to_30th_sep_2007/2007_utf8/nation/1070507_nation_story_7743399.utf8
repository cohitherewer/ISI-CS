 Misconduct glare on biologists

 The report published in The Telegraph on March 6, 2007

 New Delhi, May 6: An academic watchdog has indicted biologists in Pune of scientific misconduct, but is silent on whether a government committee of experts attempted to shield their alleged wrongdoing. 

 The Society for Scientific Values has completed its investigation into allegations that biologist Gopal Kundu and his colleagues at the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, had reused data photographic strips from one research paper into another. 

 As reported in The Telegraph earlier this year, the Journal of Biological Chemistry a top US journal had withdrawn the second paper by the NCCS scientists, even after a committee of senior Indian scientists had exonerated them. 

 A senior editor of the journal said the reasons for the withdrawal of the paper by the Pune scientists would be better described as scientific misconduct rather than a minor lapse of judgement. 

 The society has said its own investigation led it to concur with the journals decision. Kundu and his co-workers are all guilty of misconduct for fabrication of data in their paper, it said in its case summary. 

 The society has called on the expert committee members to reconsider their position in the light of the journal and its parallel, but similar, conclusions.

 The SSV (Society for Scientific Values) currently does not have any evidence to distinguish between wilfull complicity and a genuine error of judgement by the committee, it said, asking the authorities to take appropriate and exemplary action on all the authors of the papers. 

 Kundu has denied wrongdoing and asserted that the allegation of misconduct is baseless. Even if you remove the two blots strips from the paper, the experimental findings remain valid, he told The Telegraph. 

 Both Kundu and the chairman of the committee that exonerated him said they would not like to describe the journals decision to withdraw the paper as wrong, but would prefer to call it a harsh decision. 

 Chairman Govindrajan Padmanaban said he is now preparing a detailed dossier of how the committee arrived at its conclusions and would submit it to the department of biotechnology the agency that supports the NCCS in two weeks. 

 Weve tried to be as objective as possible and there is no need for us to revise our report, said Padmanaban, former director of the Indian Institute of Science. We dont know what methodology the JBC (Journal of Biological Chemistry) used to analyse the data.

 But across Indias biology community, the case has evoked sharp reactions with scientists wondering over the disagreement between the expert committee on one side, and the journal and society on the other. 

 These events raise suspicions of a cover-up, said Lalji Singh, director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad. 

 Its disturbing that members of the committee are highly reputed, represent the face of Indian science to the world, and some of them have been icons for us, said Udaykumar Ranga, a scientist at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bangalore.

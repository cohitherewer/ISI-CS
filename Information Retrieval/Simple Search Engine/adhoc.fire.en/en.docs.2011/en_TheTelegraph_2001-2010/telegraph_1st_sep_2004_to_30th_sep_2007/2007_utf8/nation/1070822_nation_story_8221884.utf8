 MLA threat to kill minister

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Srinagar, Aug. 21: An alleged death threat by a legislator to a senior Congress minister sparked a furore in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly today. 

 Panthers Party MLA Harsh Dev Singh was ordered to leave the session. But he refused to budge and House marshals had to force him out.

 Singh, a former education minister, was voted the best legislator two years ago.

 As soon as the House met this afternoon, rural development minister Jugal Kishore said Singh had threatened to kill him a few days ago. 

 I have given it in writing to you. It is a very serious issue and action should be taken against him, Kishore told Speaker Tara Chand.

 The minister also accused Singh of assaulting him in the Assembly lobby in the presence of other legislators.

 But Singh denied the charge. He said he had not issued any threat but had called the minister a murderer. 

 He is a murderer because he suspended a senior assistant in his department who was later proved not guilty. He could not tolerate the insult and died.

 Mangat Ram Sharma, a Congress minister, backed Kishore. Harsh called me some days ago and threatened to kill Jugal, Sharma said.

 As legislators created a din, the Speaker admitted a motion seeking Singhs suspension. The House accepted it by a voice vote. 

 The Panthers Party had pulled out of the ruling coalition after the Congress refused to snap ties with the PDP for demanding withdrawal of troops from the Valley.

 Land salve to soothe routine wound

 - Amar salvage mission after Shivpal comment

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Jan. 8: Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh today visited Nithari and distributed residential plots to families of some of the child victims in a desperate bid to contain the damage done by chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavs brother Shivpals observations on the killings.

 Public works minister Shivpal the first Samajwadi leader to visit Nithari had angered the residents by saying that such incidents were routine.

 Amar, who visited the village amid heavy deployment of security forces, attacked the Congress and the BJP for politicising the killings.

 Congress president Sonia Gandhi and BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee are trying to politicise the incident. The Uttar Pradesh chief minister has not visited the area but is keeping himself abreast of the developments, he said.

 While Amar was distributing papers of residential plots to 17 families, the rest of the villagers were cordoned off lest they turned violent.

 As soon as Amar left, the villagers came out on the street with photographs of missing children in their hands, shouting: Amar Singh murdabad, Mulayam Singh murdabad.

 Shivpals observations had pushed the Uttar Pradesh government on the back foot and, following sustained pressure from political parties, compelled Mulayam to finally agree to a CBI probe into the killings.

 Amar blamed the media for misquoting Shivpal and accused Sonia of hatching a conspiracy along with the BJP and the Bahujan Samaj Party to pull down the Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Flicker of power hope for Bengal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 12: The power gloom enveloping Bengal lifted a little today with two thermal units whirring back to life.

 However, there wasnt much respite from power cuts for the city and the districts as the deficit was still huge. At 642mw, the cumulative shortfall in the areas covered by the CESC and the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company was 181mw less than yesterday. 

 Calcutta and nearby areas were plunged into darkness for over an hour, while lights were off in the districts for four to five hours.

 The situation improved marginally today and we could supply about 315mw to the CESC grid. Tomorrow, we expect to supply more, said M.K. Roy, the director (commercial) of the distribution agency. The CESCs own units generated about 1,000mw.

 The power crisis, the result of last weeks downpour, began on Monday when about 20,000 tonnes of wet and unusable coal arrived at the Kolaghat plant, forcing the closure of two 210mw units. 

 One of them started today, as did the 500mw thermal unit at the Farakka plant that had collapsed on Tuesday following a tube leak. 

 In the next two days, the situation will improve further as well be able to start another unit in Kolaghat by then. We also expect to start on Saturday the 210mw unit at the Bakreswar power plant that broke down yesterday, said S. Mahapatra, the managing director of Power Development Corporation which runs the power plants.

 At hospital, inhospitable face of India

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: Moth-eaten mattresses, dirty rugs, stained pillows and howls of pain. It could be a refugee camp, but the small white shamiana at Safdarjung Hospital is where India is hosting relatives of Pakistani survivors of the Samjhauta Express blasts.

 Squatting on his haunches at one end of the temporary shelter outside the burns ward at one of the premier hospitals in the capital, Shahnawaz Ahmed looked lost. 

 His nine-year-old son Shamim, who had journeyed across the border with an uncle, is battling for life. 

 My wife Asma (in Karachi) is worrying about Shamim. Her visa wasnt cleared. Im glad she didnt come. Look at this place, the 40-year-olds voice trailed off. 

 Shahnawaz, though, got his visa cleared in just two hours. The businessman recounted how an Indian official in Lahore had hugged him while handing him back his passport. 

 It seemed so different from earlier times I have visited India. We (families of victims) were being treated so well, he said. 

 An agonising 40-hour bus ride from Lahore to Delhi followed. But for Shahnawaz and the others who came to look for their relatives, the ordeal had only begun. 

 Once the authorities brought us to Safdarjung Hospital, we were left to look after ourselves. Delhi is so expensive. I went to look up a hotel near Jama Masjid. But I cannot even afford the cheap places, complained 49-year-old Reshma, the mother of 20-year-old Mohammed Shakil who is lying a few beds away from Shamim.

 If the authorities were being accused of not being hospitable, Ashok Randhawa was being showered with praise.

 From the Delhi blasts in 2005 to the Meerut inferno last year, and now the train bombings the Sarojini Nagar trader isnt new to playing samaritan. 

 The tent that provides shelter to Shahnawaz and the others has been put up by Randhawa. He has also organised a small tea stall outside the burns ward where relatives of the victims can get tea for free. 

 The Sarojini Nagar blast changed me. I would be typically selfish, not spend a penny on anyone else, before the blast. Some of the worst incidents in life make people better, he said. 

 But Randhawa doesnt want any recognition from either the government or the media. Ive got what I wanted. A bhai here has invited me to his home in Karachi. Thats all I need.

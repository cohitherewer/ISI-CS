 Heartland headache for Cong 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 15: Rahul Gandhi is ready to hit the streets of Uttar Pradesh to establish sampark (contact) with people before the April 7 Assembly elections, but his party might have to tread the poll road alone. 

 The Congresss prospective allies like the Jan Morcha and the Rashtriya Lok Dal have reportedly refused to scale down their demands for seats. 

 Congress sources said while the Jan Morcha had asked for 190 seats out of 403, the RLD wanted 100. Had the Congress agreed to the demands, it would have been left with a little over 100 seats. 

 This is unthinkable, we may as well not fight the election, said a cabinet minister. 

 V.P. Singh, the Morcha spearhead, announced this evening that the front, which includes the CPI and other smaller parties, would contest 193 seats on its own.

 Asked to comment on the alliance, Congress president Sonia Gandhi said: Well, we are talking to them.

 When her attention was drawn to the Morchas announcement, she said: I cannot speak on behalf of V.P. Singh.

 from Gandhi My Father, Mandela 

 Calcutta, July 29: All freedom struggles demand political, social and personal sacrifices. It is the price we have to pay.

 In a recorded message to declare open the world premiere of Gandhi My Father at Johannesburg, Nelson Mandela equated his own freedom struggle with that of Mahatma Gandhi. 

 He met the main cast and crew of the Anil Kapoor production a few hours before the premiere at the prestigious Nu Metro, Monte Casino in Johannesburg because he wasnt sure if he would be able to make the evening show owing to ill health. The glittering red carpet premiere was, however, attended by South African President Thabo Mbeki and other cabinet ministers.

 I had once remarked that India gave us barrister Gandhi and South Africa gave back Mahatma Gandhi the great soul, recalled Mandela. 

 Besides Kapoor, those present at the meeting and subsequently at the premiere were director Feroz Abbas Khan and actors Akshaye Khanna, Bhoomika Chawla, Shefali Shah and Darshan Zariwala.

 Gandhi My Father revolves around the strained relationship between Mahatma Gandhi (Zariwala) and his elder son Harilal (Khanna). The way I look at it, every time Harilal looked for Bapu, he found a Mahatma, said Khanna. For Anil Kapoor, it was a story that needed to be told and so his decision to turn to production full-time.

 For Mandela, it was like turning back time when he himself made many a sacrifice for his country. I know the sacrifices that my family has made and the anguish and pain they have gone through, he said. This unique story of a father coming to terms with his family is instructive and deeply moving.

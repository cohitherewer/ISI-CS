 Whatmore gets a rap from BCB

Dhaka: The BCB criticised coach Dav Whatmore on Thursday for expressing interest in succeeding Greg Chappell as India coach. 

The BCB were annoyed Whatmore put his hand up for the India job while the team was still involved in a World Cup campaign. 

We are in the middle of a very high-profile tournament. At this stage any such interest of the coach would certainly distract our team, Riazuddin Al Mamun, a joint-secretary of the BCB, said. He should not have said so, when we have a contract with him. 

 Whatmore confirmed his interest in taking over the reins in India after Chappell handed in his resignation on Wednesday, two weeks after the 1983 champions first-round exit from the World Cup. 

If the opportunity comes along, surely any person who is a professional coach and prides himself in doing a good job would be interested in coaching the Indian team, Whatmore told an Indian news channel. His present contract ends in May. (REUTERS)

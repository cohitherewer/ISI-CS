 Police threatened to arrest celebrating Aussies

 Australians celebrate with the World Cup in Bridgetown 

Melbourne: The World Cup final fiasco was not the last of the unpleasant incidents which marred the tournament in the Caribbean. According to a media report, Australian players ran the risk of being arrested by Barbadian police when they were celebrating their hattrick of Cup triumphs. 

An Australian daily has reported that an agitated police officer allegedly shouldered captain Ricky Ponting when he asked for at least two minutes to sing their victory song at the centre of the Kensington Oval ground after their chaotic 53-run win over Sri Lanka in the rain-marred final. 

The officer also warned the players that they ran the risk of being arrested if they did not leave the ground immediately, the paper learnt a week after the incident. Cricket Australia spokesman Peter Young confirmed the police had ordered the players off the field. 

It was around the time when the players were due to go back to their hotel, but they wanted to sing the team song, as is their habit after big tournaments, at centre wicket, Young said. 

However, the police were at the end of their shift and told the players to move on. They did and went back to the team hotel where they sang the song by the pool. Glenn McGrath led the song, he was quoted as saying by the paper. 

Sergeant Rock of the Barbados police denied any knowledge of a disturbance between his men and the Australian team. That is news to me. I havent heard anything about that, he said. 

Other disasters that hit the World Cup leading many observers to call it the worst ever World Cup included the murder of Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer, scheduling problems and administrative difficulties. Also, there were too many lopsided matches, at all stages of the tournament.

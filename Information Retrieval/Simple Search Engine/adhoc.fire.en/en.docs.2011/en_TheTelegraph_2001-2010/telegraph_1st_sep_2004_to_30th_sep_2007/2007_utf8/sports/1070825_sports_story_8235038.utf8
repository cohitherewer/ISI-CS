 Atwal tied 68th after Round I

Bridgeport (US): A double bogey on the final hole undid all his good work and Arjun Atwal had to settle for an even par round to be tied 68th after the opening round in the National Mining Association Pete Dye Classic golf on the Nationwide Tour in the United States. 

Atwal, trying hard to get back to the PGA Tour, was two-under after 17 holes, which did not look too bad but disaster awaited him in the final hole in the form of a double bogey to mar his show. 

At the top of the table, Parker McLachlin fired a nine-under 63 to surge into the lead, two-stroke ahead of the Scott Parel and David Hearn duo.

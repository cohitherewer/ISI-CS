 India A thrash Kenya

New Delhi: Praveen Kumar produced an allround performance as India A trounced hosts Kenya by 10 wickets in the opening match of the Tri-series in Nairobi on Tuesday. 

Praveen picked up three wickets and then hit an unbeaten 57 to help India overhaul Kenyas paltry total of 98 in 7.4 overs at the Gymkhana Cricket Club Ground. 

Pankaj Singh bagged four for 29 and Praveen three for 28, justifying captain Mohammed Kaifs decision to bowl under overcast conditions. 

The inexperienced Kenyan batting line-up collapsed in just 26.2 overs. 

Skipper Thomas Odoyo stood tall amid the ruins with a 43 (53 balls), but his solo effort was not enough to compensate for others failure. Three batsmen were dismissed without scoring. 

India A were off to a flying start with Yousuf Pathan (29) and Praveen going hammer and tongs. 

Man of the Match Praveen smashed four sixes and six boundaries en route to his half-century. India A take on Sri Lanka A on Wednesday.

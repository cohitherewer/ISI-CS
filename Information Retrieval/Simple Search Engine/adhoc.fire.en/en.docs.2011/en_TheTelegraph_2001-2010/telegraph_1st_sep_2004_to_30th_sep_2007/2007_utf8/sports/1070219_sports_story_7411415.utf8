The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fans target coach

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Fans of the green-and-maroon brigade at the Salt Lake Stadium were obviously a disappointed lot. And it was the current Mohun Bagan coach, Robson Mattos, who incurred their wrath. 

Following Sundays loss, Bagans irate supporters breached the security cordon and went for the coach while he was boarding the team bus. 

However, timely police intervention prevented any mishap as Robson was taken to the team bus amid tight security. The protesters gained in numbers owing largely to the adjacent book fair. 

Mohun Bagan officials, too, appeared to be unhappy with Robson as club secretary Anjan Mitra calling for a meeting with the players on this issue. According to Mitra, the course of action would be decided after Mondays meeting. 

Asked whether its all over for Robson, Mitra said: Its not in my hands I cant decide that. Well talk to players and take all opinions into consideration before arriving at a joint decision.

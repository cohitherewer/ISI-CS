 Alonso wins a thriller

 - Raikkonen retires in rain-marred GP 

 Fernando Alonso with the trophy on Sunday 

Nuerburgring: Two-time defending Formula One champion Fernando Alonso passed Felipe Massa of Ferrari on a slippery track late in the race on Sunday to win the European Grand Prix. 

The McLaren driver closes to within two points of leader Lewis Hamilton in the standings 70-68. 

Hamilton finished ninth and out of the points for the first time in 10 races in his rookie F1 season. He had to start from 10th on the grid after crashing his McLaren in qualifying Saturday. 

Its a new experience for me, not having to find my way to the podium, he said. 

Massa was eight seconds behind in second place with Mark Webber third for Red Bull to equal his career best. 

Kimi Raikkonen retired due to a problem with his Ferrari, thus ending his hopes of a third win in a row for Ferrari and continuing a Nuerburgring jinx. He has twice retired while leading at the Nuerburgring in his time with previous team McLaren. 

The Finn, who started on pole position at a circuit that holds plenty of bitter memories, slowed suddenly on the 35th of 60 laps while running in third position. 

The race was halted after four laps because of a heavy shower. The rain returned with 11 laps left with Massa in the lead ahead of Alonso. Three laps later, it began to rain harder and both drivers went in for wet tires. 

Alonso squeezed out Giancarlo Fisichellas Renault in the pit lane to get into position to attack Massa. 

A great battle ensued over the next two laps and with less than five laps remaining, the two touched wheels as Alonso pushed past and went on to record his 18th career F1 victory. 

He took the chequered flag 8.1 seconds ahead of Massa, who struggled with his last set of tyres, and had a heated exchange with the Brazilian before they stepped on the podium. Alonso later apologised. 

 Austrian Alexander Wurz was fourth 

 for Williams, ahead of Briton David Coulthard for Red Bull 

 and Germanys Nick Heidfeld for BMW Sauber. Polands 

 Robert Kubica was seventh for BMW Sauber and Finlands 

 Heikki Kovalainen took the final point for champions Renault.

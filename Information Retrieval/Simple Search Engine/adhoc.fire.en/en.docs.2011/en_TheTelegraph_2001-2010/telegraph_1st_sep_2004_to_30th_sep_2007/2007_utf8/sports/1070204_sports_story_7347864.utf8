Johannesburg: Graeme Smith and Loots Bosman pounded the Pakistan bowlers as South Africa raced to a 10-wicket win in a Twenty20 International at the Wanderers on Friday night. 

Pakistan struggled to 129 for eight after being sent in, with only two batsmen reaching 20 against South Africas all-pace attack on a hot, humid evening during which the bowlers were able to swing the ball and get movement off the pitch. But any demon in the pitch seemed to disappear as Smith and Bosman went on an all-out attack. 

They took South Africa to 132 for no wicket off only 11.3 overs. It was the highest partnership in the short history of 20-over Internationals. 

Smith smashed 71 not out off 40 balls with nine fours and four sixes, finishing the match with an over-boundary off Afridi, while Bosman was unbeaten on 53 off 32 balls with five fours and two sixes. 

The two sides meet again on Sunday, in the first of five ODIs in Centurion. 

Smith said his bowlers had set up the Twenty20 win. 

There was a little bit in the wicket with the new ball and I thought we bowled superbly, said the skipper. 

New cap Alfonso Thomas, who took a wicket with his first ball in international cricket, took three for 25. 

Smith, playing in his fifth Twenty20 tie, became the first batsman to score three half-centuries in the shortest form of the international game. 

Loots and I had a bit of fun, he said. There was a short boundary on one side which we tried to cash in on. Loots got the momentum started and I just carried on with him.

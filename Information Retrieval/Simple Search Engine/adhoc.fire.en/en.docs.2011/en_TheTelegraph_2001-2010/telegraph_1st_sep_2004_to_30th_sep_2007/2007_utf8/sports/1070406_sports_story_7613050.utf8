 ECB wants Fletcher to continue 

Melbourne: Tom Moody has not been approached to replace Duncan Fletcher as England coach, who has been allowed to continue on the post as long as he wishes. 

ECB spokesman Colin Gibson said Fletcher has the job for as long as he wants. 

Weve got a very fine coach in Duncan Fletcher, who is paid $1million a year. Hes got a year-to-year rolling contract. Hes got the job with England for as long as he wishes and hes concentrating on winning the World Cup, he was quoted as saying by an Australian newspaper. 

Moody, 41, who withdrew from the race to be Australias next coach when he and Tim Nielsen were the final two candidates, is highly thought of after his success with Sri Lanka. (PTI)

England vs Sri lanka Highlights

 Sanath Jayasuriya became the most capped player in ODIs. He was playing in his 385th match, which took him past Sachin Tendulkars tally of 384 matches. For the record, Jayasuriyas tally include one match for the Asian XI.

 Jayasuriya (1001 runs) became the tenth batsman in WC history to aggregate over 1000 runs. He becomes the second Sri Lankan after former teammate Aravinda de Silva (1064) to do so.

 Jayasuriya also becomes the fourth left-hander to achieve the landmark after Brian Lara, Sourav Ganguly and Stephen Fleming.

 Playing in his 22nd ODI match Sajid Mahmood (4/50) claims his maiden four wicket haul. His previous best was the 3/37 which he took against India in Jamshedpur a year ago.

 The reverse sweep six by English keeper Paul Nixon was the 264th overboundary hit during this edition of the WC in 33 matches. The ongoing World Cup now has been witness to most number of sixes, hit in a single edition, surpassing the 263 in 2003 (in 52 matches).

 The 87-run stand between Ravindra Bopara and Paul Nixon was Englands best for the seventh wicket in the WC. The pair obliterates the previous best of 44 (unbeaten) between Ian Gould and Graham Dilley against New Zealand at The Oval in 1983. Incidentally, the Bopara-Nixon effort was the second best for the seventh wicket in the WC. The best still remains as 98 between West Indians Ramnaresh Sarwan and Ridley Jacobs against the Black Caps in Port Elizabeth in 2003.

 This was the sixth time in ODIs England have lost a match by just 2 runs!

 This was the third narrowest win in terms of runs in the WC. On two occasions (in 1987 and 1992) Australia beat India by one run.

 Though Sri Lanka have won eight of their last 11 ODI encounters against England, this was their only second win over England in eight WC matches.

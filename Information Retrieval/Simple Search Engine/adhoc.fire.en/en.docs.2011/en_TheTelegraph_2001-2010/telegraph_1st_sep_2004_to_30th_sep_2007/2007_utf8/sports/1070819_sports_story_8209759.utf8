 Srivats needs to improve: Rajput

A STAFF REPORTER

 Lalchand Rajput 

Calcutta: India Under-19 wicketkeeper-batsman Srivats Goswami didnt have an impressive tour of Sri Lanka recently and coach Lalchand Rajput feels he needs an allround improvement. 

Srivats began with an impressive 77 against the hosts in the one-day tri-series (Bangladesh were the third side) but failed to create any impression in the rest of the matches. He came a cropper with the bat in the two Tests that followed. 

Srivats was the lone representative from the state in the national side. 

His wicketkeeping has to improve His fitness also needs improvement as he is weak on his legs, Rajput told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

Rajput is in the city to conduct a Level-II coaching course. 

Rajput also had some advice on Srivatss batting. He needs to work on the technical aspect He has the tendency to play too many shots that brought about his downfall in Sri Lanka. He should make necessary adjustments. 

Srivats, currently at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore, is aware of his batting shortcomings. 

This was my first tour with the national side. It was great to wear the national colours. The international exposure also helped me a lot. I know I need to work a lot on my batting. Im trying to live up to expectations, he said.

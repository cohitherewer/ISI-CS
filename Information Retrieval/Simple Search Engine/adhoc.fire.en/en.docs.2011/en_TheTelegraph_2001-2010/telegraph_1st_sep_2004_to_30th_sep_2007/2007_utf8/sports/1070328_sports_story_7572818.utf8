 Lance Gibbs tips for the Irish

Georgetown: Former West Indies off-spinner Lance Gibbs, the first spinner to take 300 Test wickets, tutored some of Irelands players at Bourda on Monday ahead of their first Super Eight match. 

Ireland play local rivals England on Friday at Providence Stadium with both teams aiming to record their first points in the table having progressed with none. 

The input of Gibbs, 72, who played for West Indies between 1958 and 1976, will no doubt add to Irelands preparations for what is probably the most important match in their history. 

Gibbs, born in Guyana, spoke to Irelands captain Trent Johnston and off-spinners Kyle McCallan and Andrew White. 

It was interesting, Gibbs said. I told them how to grip the ball. I showed them my spinning finger and I stopped playing in 76 and its still deformed so if they are spinners they should have some indication that theyre spin bowlers.

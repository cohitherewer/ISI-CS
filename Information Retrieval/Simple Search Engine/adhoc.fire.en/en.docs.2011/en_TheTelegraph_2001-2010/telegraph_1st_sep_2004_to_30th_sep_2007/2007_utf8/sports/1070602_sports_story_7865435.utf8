 Indian men in final, women falter

Jaipur: A power-packed display by reigning champions India saw them thrash Australia 3-0 and set up a title clash with Singapore in the mens team event of the 17th Commonwealth Table Tennis Championship here on Friday. 

The womens team, however, went down 0-3 to top seeds Singapore and their title hopes were dashed. They had to be content with bronze which they shared with Australia. 

In mens event, Singapore topped the group E by beating Scotland 3-0 and the summit clash will be a repeat of the Commonwealth Games final in Melbourne last year where India had pulled off a major upset to win the gold. 

Australia and Nigeria will clash for the third place. 

The mens team impressed with their spirited display in their last group F match. 

Australian did a gamble by playing Kiet Song Tran in first singles but could not get the desired result. Shubhajit Saha beat song 11-8, 8-11, 11-3, 11-6 to give India a 1-0 lead. 

Sharath Kamal was up against world No. 101 William Henzell whom he beat in the Commonwealth Games final to win the bronze. 

Sharath mixed his serves well and did now allow Henzell to engage him into rallies. Fast and crisp, Sharath raced to a 11-5, 11-8, 11-6 win to give his team a 2-0 lead. Soumyadeep Roy faltered a bit but ultimately clinched the issue with a fighting 12-10, 12-5, 8-11, 6-11, 11-7 win over Kyle Davis. 

Malaysia, who beat Australia 3-0 in group F will take on Singapore in the final for the womens title. Indian eves lost to much higher ranked Singapore but they did send a few shivers down the rival camp. (PTI)

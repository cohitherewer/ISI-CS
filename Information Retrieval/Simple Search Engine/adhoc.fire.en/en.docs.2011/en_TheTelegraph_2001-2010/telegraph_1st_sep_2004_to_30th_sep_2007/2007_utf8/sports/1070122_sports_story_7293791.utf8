The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav showed the way 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Vengsarkar 

Nagpur: Dilip Vengsarkar appeared cautious despite Sourav Gangulys statement-making 98 at the VCA Stadium on Sunday. He wants to keep his fingers crossed and isnt committing anything. At least, on record. 

Sourav played a good knock today (Sunday). He batted with authority and showed the way. But Im not reading too much into it Theres still a long way to go, the selection committee chairman told The Telegraph. 

His comments came in the backdrop of the selection of the World Cup squad, which will take place next month. The success of the new opening pair will, no doubt, make things difficult. While theres no question about Souravs selection, Gambhirs success will add to the pressure and complicate matters for Virender Sehwag. 

Vengsarkar sounded non-committal. Ill have to speak to other members of the selection committee before taking a final decision Im not in a position now to comment on Sehwags comeback, he said. 

The former India captain didnt see anything wrong in playing on such docile tracks in the build-up to the quadrennial showpiece. 

After all, a record 662 runs were scored today. It means entertainment for the crowd, who came to see India win. 

It is, however, learnt that Sehwag is likely to be tried out during the next set of one-day Internationals against Sri Lanka.

 Bond up for Twenty20 challenge

 Johannesburg: New Zealand bowling spearhead Shane Bond is determined to prove that Twenty20 is not just a batsman rsquo;s game when he returns to the international stage at next week rsquo;s world championships.

 Bond has enjoyed a four-month break since starring for the Black Caps in the World Cup in the Caribbean but he says he will be raring to go when they take on Kenya in their first match on September 12.

 ldquo;It rsquo;s nice to get back outside, everybody is looking forward to getting into some training and getting stuck into some cricket, rdquo; Bond said.

 Depressing, says Pollock

 Johannesburg: Shaun Pollock, one of the most economical pacers in world cricket, reckons the upcoming ICC World Twenty20 will leave many of his fellow bowlers in a state of depression.

 The veteran South African, currently ranked the world rsquo;s top one-day bowler, knows most batsmen will approach the 20-over format with all guns blazing and rewrite the economy rate conventions.

 For Pollock, who finally hit his maiden one-day century in June more than 11 years after his debut, the only chance of redemption will be if he gets a chance to open his shoulders himself once the tournament begins next Tuesday.

 ldquo;I think if you are only a bowler in this form of the game it would be pretty depressing, rdquo; said Pollock.

 WI-Stanford deal likely

 Miami: The WICB are to sign a five-year deal allowing the Stanford Twenty20 competition to become an official part of their calendar.

 The deal ensures that the Twenty20 tournament, a private initiative financed by Texas billionaire Allen Stanford, enjoys the blessing of Caribbean cricket authorities and avoids any clashes with other competitions.

 An agreement also avoids the risk of a rift such as the one in India.

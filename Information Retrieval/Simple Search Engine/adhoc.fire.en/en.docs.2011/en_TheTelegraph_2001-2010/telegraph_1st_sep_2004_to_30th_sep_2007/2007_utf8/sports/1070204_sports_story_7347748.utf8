The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sania will be toughest in Bangalore, says Serena

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Serena Williams

New Delhi: Her fans may still be celebrating, but for Serena Williams the great comeback victory in the Australian Open final is already a thing of the past. Any suggestion that she achieved a near-impossible dream to topple top seed Maria Sharapova in the title round is brushed aside rather casually by the American star. 

On Friday night, when Serena talked at length with the Indian media here during a tele-conference from her Florida home, she sounded rather amused that people were still probing her Australian Open victory. 

Beating Sharapova was last week, said Serena. Its a new week now. She must have gone back home and started practising, said the World No. 14, stopping short of saying she was more concerned about the coming events than the first Grand Slam of the season. 

Sounding sleepy but alert in dealing with every query, Serena was more enthusiastic about coming to play the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour event in Bangalore to be held from February 12-18. Frankly, I am very excited about visiting India. I have never been there and am looking forward to play in India. 

And when the inevitable question came about her opinion on Indian star Sania Mirza, Serena didnt wait a second before admitting that the Hyderabad girl could be her strongest opponent in the Bangalore meet. I expect to receive strong opposition from her. She is a good and a strong player. She plays well against me. 

Serena said she was not able to watch Sania in action in the Australian Open this time as she remained focussed with her own game in the Grand Slam meet. She played well, I believe. She has improved a lot. 

Serena also has no qualms about playing in smaller tournaments even after here victory in the Australian Open. I always want to play more and win more tournaments. Thats a pretty tough job, you must understand. I would also like to team up with Venus to play the doubles and the Fed Cup. 

The only time Serena sounded on the back foot was when she was asked whether the WTA has been doing a satisfactory job on the doping front. Oh my God, was her first reaction before she regained her composure to back the WTA solidly. I think the WTA has been doing a far better job than most other sports federations in the world. I can say that since I have been put to test on so many occasions. 

Serena is also not giving any thought to hanging up her racket. I am not thinking about retirement at the moment, thats for sure. I want to keep going and win. I know I have been playing for a long time, but I want to continue for many more years, may be eight or nine I really dont know. 

In the end, Serena made it clear that its tennis thats bringing her to India and nothing beyond that. No, I dont expect to go around Bangalore for sightseeing. I have to be focussed on my game. 

Meanwhile, Shikha Uberoi has been given a wild card for the event.

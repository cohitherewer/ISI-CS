 Tripura conquer Assam

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Assam lost their second consecutive match in the National Twenty20 match (East Zone) this time a seven-wicket defeat at the hands of Tripura. Having lost to Bengal on Day I, Assam now have virtually no hope of topping the zone. 

Put into bat, Assam were bundled out for a meagre 82 in 15.4 overs, J. Arun Kumar top-scoring with a run-a-ball 31. 

Tripura, now under former Bengal coach Karsan Ghavri, called the shots from the outset. Assam were reduced to 10 for three in the first 20 balls, with both openers Parvez Aziz and Sourav Bhagwati being run out. 

Assam never looked like putting on a big total from that point. The biggest partnership of the innings was just 22, for the fifth wicket between Arun Kumar and Gakul Sharma (22). 

Tripura came up with an outstanding fielding effort and some disciplined bowling. Vinit Jain, Manoj Singh, Tushar and Rajib Saha bagged two wickets each. 

Tripura lost Tapan Sutradhar early and then slumped to 34 for three. But some steady batting by opener Ansul Lamba, who remained unbeaten on 48, and Manoj (14 not out) saw the side through with 33 balls to spare. 

BRIEF SCORES 

Assam 82 in 15.4 ovs (J. Arun Kumar 31). Tripura 86/3 in 14.3 ovs (A. Lamba 48 ..). Tripura won by 7 wkts.

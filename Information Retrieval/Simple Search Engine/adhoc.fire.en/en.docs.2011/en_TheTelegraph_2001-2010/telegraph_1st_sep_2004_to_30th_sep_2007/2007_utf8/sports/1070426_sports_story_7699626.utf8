 Wayne Rooney rips up Milans script

HENRY WINTER in MANCHESTER

Manchester United just never give up. Just when AC Milan were beginning to savour Kakas brace of away goals, letting their minds drift to a straightforward-looking return at the San Siro next week and perhaps even the final in Athens itself, Wayne Rooney wiped the smiles off their famous faces (briefly reported in TWednesdays Late City edition). 

One would have thought the Italians would know a little bit about English resilience by now. Just as Liverpools refusal to surrender stunned Kaka and company in Istanbul two years ago, so a forward raised on the streets of Croxteth embarrassed the lords of Lombardy. 

Thirty seconds into stoppage time, with Milan hugely satisfied with their nights work, Rooney ripped up the script. Just when United did not have a second leg to stand on, Rooney gave them balance and hope. 

It is these moments that make Rooney so special, so popular with teammates, with fans and all others who admire those maestros prepared to sweat ceaselessly for the cause. With the tie tipped in Milans favour, Rooney kept running, kept gambling that the right ball would come. 

Milan paid for listening for the referees final whistle, not the on-rushing foot-steps of Rooney. What a difference one second makes. Just one touch. Just one moment of magic from the England striker as he raced on to Ryan Giggs clever pass. Alessandro Nesta threw himself across, the centre-half belatedly realising Rooneys murderous intent. Too late. The connection was made. Struck hard and fast first time, Rooneys shot sped past Dida at the near post. 

How Milan missed the positional presence and vigilance of Paolo Maldini, whose aching knee forced his removal from central defence at half-time. Milan were leading 2-1 at that stage, the Brazilian zephyr that is Kaka having twice blown through Uniteds back-line after Cristiano Ronaldos early opener. 

The second half of a mesmerising game belonged to United and particularly Rooney. The last time Rooney and United encountered Milan, they had bowed out of the European Cup meekly in 2005, with the rancorous cries of Roy Keane stinging their ears. Uniteds then captain delivered such a caustic critique on MUTV of the hunger levels of some of his teammates that the programme was pulled. 

Uniteds desire could not be questioned on Tuesday night. Even when Kaka was ripping them apart, even when the Italians were giving them a lesson in the art of possession, United kept the faith. 

Leading by example, Giggs was terrific. Ronaldo was a lively outlet, always available, always keen to take on opponents. The game had begun with Nesta managing to block a shot from Rooney, but United still profited. Sir Alex Fergusons men sensed a vulnerability in the visitors ranks. Giggs bent in a corner from the right, and Ronaldos header bounced in off Dida. Such masters of European ring-craft, Milan absorbed this shock, and Uniteds flurries of combinations, and hit back on the counter. 

After 22 minutes, Clarence Seedorf played the killer pass,. Kaka was off and running, escaping from the slow-reacting Michael Carrick, outpacing Gabby Heinze and sliding the ball left-footed past Edwin van der Sar. Agonisingly for United, lightning struck twice. Kaka was imperious, elusive, a thrilling ambassador from the land that gave the world the Beautiful Game. Given half a yard again after 37 minutes, Kaka got away from United once more. He beat Fletcher to the ball, and headed it past Heinze as the Argentine sought to close him down. 

As hope ebbed, Rooney sprang to Uniteds rescue with his first goal just before the hour mark. Fletcher found Carrick, who touched the ball to Paul Scholes.

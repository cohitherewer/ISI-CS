 Postpone visit, Fifa tells United

Kuala Lumpur: Fifa has urged Manchester United to postpone a planned Asian tour in July, backing Asian soccer chiefs who called the team immoral for scheduling a visit that clashes with the regions top tournament. 

Japan, Malaysia, South Korea and Macau which hope to host Manchester United should select new dates that do not clash with the July 7-29 Asian Cup tournament, Fifa president Sepp Blatter said. 

It is legitimate to say you are welcome but please not at a time when we are playing, according to an international calendar accepted by the whole football family, our biggest competition in Asia, Blatter said in a speech to the Asian Football Confederations (AFC) annual congress. 

We have to abide by the ruling of the Asian football family. Manchester United cant come in July, said Tengku Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, the countrys top soccer official. 

Football Association of Malaysia general secretary Ibrahim Saad criticised the AFC for interfering in Malaysias 50th anniversary celebrations. 

I dont think its right for other people to tell our country how we should celebrate our 50th anniversary, he said. 

Mohammed bin Hammam, meanwhile, was on Tuesday sworn in unopposed to a second four-year term as AFC president. 

The 58-year-old was also unopposed when voted into office for his first term. 

The AFC Congress also approved an increase in the number of vice-presidents to five from four and ruled that for the first time one of them must be a woman from 2009.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ...Despite glitches 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Despite some last-minute arrangements, the prevailing excitement around Joseph Sepp Blatters visit to the Maidan was marred by some untoward incidents on Sunday. 

During his stopover at the Mohun Bagan club, legendary Chuni Goswami barely managed to welcome the Fifa president before he was over-powered by the ever-enthusiastic club officials. All of them wanted to get close to Blatter when he was planting a sapling at the club lawn. In addition to this, the frenzied lensmen broke free from the barricade and entered the lawn, leading to a temporary mayhem. 

The worse, however, was still to come. 

Between Blatters visits to East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting club, he was to pay tribute at Gosto Pal statue. Bengal Olympic Association (BOA) organised the occasion. A makeshift wooden stage was set for photographers and electronic mediapersons. As Blatter was about to garland Pals statue near the main entrance of Eden Gardens, the stage crashed but luckily no one was injured. 

A BOA official later said: This is an unfortunate incident, but there were more people on the podium than expected. 

While Blatter didnt wish to dwell on the incident, an All India Football Federation official observed that it couldve been avoided with better organisation.

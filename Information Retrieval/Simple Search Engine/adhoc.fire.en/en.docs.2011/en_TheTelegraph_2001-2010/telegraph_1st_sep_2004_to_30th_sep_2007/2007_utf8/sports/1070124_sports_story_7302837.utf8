 Muzumdar hits 97 vs Baroda

Vadodara: Captain Amol Muzumdar smashed a solid 97 runs to help Mumbai score a respectable 233 in their first innings against Baroda on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy Super League semi-final here on Tuesday. Baroda were at nine runs without loss at the close. 

Muzumdar, who faced 208 balls, hit 18 four during his knock which fell just three run short for a century but took Mumbai past the 200 mark. 

Muzumdar, who played confidently, failed left-arm seemer Irfan Pathans delivery and ended up giving a catch to his brother Yusuf standing in gully. 

Pathan took three wickets conceding 49 runs but he lacked penetration and could not maintain line and length of the bowling. His bowling speed was below 120 kms. 

Another seamer Rakesh Patel continued to shine with the ball by taking three wickets. 

Earlier, the visitors were struggling at 40 for two at one stage after they lost two quick wickets of Wasim Jaffer and Sahil Kukreja and were 96 for four at lunch. 

Muzumdar and Abhishek Nair put up a brave front and stitched a 70-run partnership for the fifth wicket. After Nairs departure, the others followed at regular intervals.

 Malinga may miss Aussie tie 

St Georges: Sri Lanka fast bowler Lasith Malinga is doubtful for the World Cup Super Eight match against champions Australia, according to team manager Michael Tissera (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). 

Malinga, 23, missed the six-wicket Super Eight win over New Zealand on Thursday after damaging left ankle ligaments during a training session. 

With Sri Lanka needing just a win from their two remaining Super Eight games to make the semi-finals, it now looks as if Malinga will miss Mondays match against Australia in a bid to make sure hes fit to face Ireland two days later. 

Hes been walking and feeling much better, Tissera said on Friday. I dont know whether we will risk him for that game (against Australia). Hes doubtful. It may be better to keep him for the game against Ireland. (AGENCIES)

 Collingwoods finesse enough to paper over English cracks

CHRISTOPHER MARTIN-JENKINS in GEORGETOWN

Seventy-two runs from the last six overs and another outstanding innings by Paul Collingwood eventually justified Englands safety-first approach to innings-building in Guyanas tropical heat Sunday. Their total of 266 for seven was enough in the end to beat Ireland, but it was not easy for them either with bat or ball. 

In the field, until Andrew Flintoff returned to snuff out a spirited late flourish, it was England spinners who made the difference. Monty Panesar, with two wickets, bowled well again in conditions that suited him, but the pleasant surprise was the performance of Michael Vaughan, with one for 34 from nine overs of nicely flighted off breaks. 

After another failure with the bat, he demonstrated at once his good cricket brain and his recovery from the fourth operation on his right knee. It was a tough game, he said with feeling and he knows that he will have to start contributing with the bat, too, if England are to progress. 

If Sri Lanka beat the West Indies, England are almost certainly going to have to defeat Sri Lanka in Antigua on Wednesday. Ed Joyce had a miserable match, badly dropping Niall Brien, Irelands top scorer, at mid-wicket when he had made only nine and he will surely have to give way to Andrew Strauss. 

As a unit, England are still doing no more than just enough even against non-Test sides but, as Vaughan emphasised, Ireland bowled and fielded combatively. 

Niall Brien, one of five left-handers in the top five, kept them in the game with a mature innings, paving the way for Trent Johnston and Andrew White to add 58 weighty runs between the 37th and 45th overs. 

Vaughan had to recall Flintoff, who had gone off the field for a time. The titan obliged by bowling Johnston before knocking over two more wickets with fast, straight bowling, but it was not until White paddled Collingwood to Paul Nixon that an upset could be ruled out. 

Ireland had taken two wickets in the first six overs, held England to only a fraction better than four an over while fielding restrictions remained, then took two more wickets as England tried in vain to take control. When Kevin Pietersen clipped Kyle McCallan, the veteran off spinner, to mid-wicket, having looked the only man in Englands top four capable of dominating, the prospect of a seriously imposing total had already gone. 

The England batsmen did not have the mental courage, it seemed, to risk the bold, over-the-top shots that have made the difference for the likes of Matthew Hayden and Graeme Smith, but Collingwood eventually hit three sixes in a performance that combined concentration with skill and stamina. 

Boyd Rankin, Ireland and Derbyshires 6ft 7in opening bowler, took two for 22 in his opening spell of five overs. Joyce obliged him in the second over by leaving a ball that nipped back to uproot his off stump and Vaughan pushed tentatively at a wide ball.

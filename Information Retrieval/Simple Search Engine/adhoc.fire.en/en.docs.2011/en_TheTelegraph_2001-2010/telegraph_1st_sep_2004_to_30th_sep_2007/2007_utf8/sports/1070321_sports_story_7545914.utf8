 Inzamam vows to win it for Woolmer

Kingston: Inzamam-ul Haq will lead Pakistan for one more match, and has vowed to win it for Bob Woolmer. 

Inzamam announced after Woolmers sudden death on Sunday that he will quit as captain and retire from one-day cricket after the World Cup. 

That leaves him one more match, against Zimbabwe on Wednesday. 

Zimbabwe are playing for a place in the Super Eights. Pakistan are playing for pride, and in memory of Woolmer. 

Well do our best for Bob, but whatever we do, it wont be enough, the 37-year-old batsman said. He was a good man. Whenever any of the boys had a problem, hed sit with them, and we were very attached to him. 

On the field, Pakistan will be boosted by the firepower of Shahid Afridi, the enigma who Woolmer rediscovered when he took over in June 2004. 

Hard-hitting Afridi missed the opening losses as he was completing a four-match ICC ban but the leg-spinning all-rounder is available again. 

Inzamam said Woolmer would have helped Pakistan to finish bounce back from the loss to Ireland, and the team owed it to him to win. 

He was a very good coach and human being. Because of this, he had a lot of respect from the team, Inzamam said. He was brave and knew how to handle the situation when everybody was feeling down. He will be well remembered. 

Captain Prosper Utseya, who leads the youngest squad in the tournament with an average age of 22, said he was encouraged despite the defeat to the hosts on Monday. 

I thought the guys fought well against the West Indies, and now we must do the same against Pakistan and see where it takes us, the 21-year-old off-spinner said. 

A Zimbabwe win would move them level on points with Ireland, whose final match is against the West Indies.

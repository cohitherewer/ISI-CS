The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tiwary surgery successful

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Surgery on Manoj Tiwarys injured right shoulder was completed successfully by Dr Andrew Wallace in London on Wednesday. 

The surgery was completed without any complication. A friend called to say that hes fine. Manoj is expected to be discharged after two-three days, brother Raj Kumar said. 

The operation lasted for about an hour. 

Manoj was admitted to King Edward VII Hospital in London in the morning and the surgery started in the afternoon (around 6 pm IST). 

Strangely, the CAB was in the dark about the happenings. We knew about the operation getting underway, but there has been no communication thereafter, joint secretary Saradindu Pal said. 

Manoj was injured during training in Dhaka ahead of the ODI series. He was forced to return and consulted Dr Anant Joshi in Mumbai. However, he was later referred to Dr Wallace.

 Lara: We have the resources to do well 

Kingston: West Indies captain Brian Lara believes his team has the ability to reach at least the semi-finals at the 2007 World Cup. 

Lara claims that the West Indies, who won the first two tournaments in 1975 and 1979, have their best chance yet to add a long-awaited third title. 

We are looking to get to the semi-finals and then take it from there, said Lara, who was forced to sit out his home island Trinidad and Tobagos domestic championship final win over Barbados at the weekend because of a knee injury. 

We have a very good record at home, and the players are really looking forward to this major event. We have a fit team that is ready to go. We have the resources to do well. 

We will be together for a few days before the World Cup gets going. Its the greatest tournament in the West Indies, and we are looking forward to doing very well. 

West Indies have been drawn in group D alongside Pakistan, Ireland and Zimbabwe in the first round of the championship and will face Pakistan in the opening game on March 13.

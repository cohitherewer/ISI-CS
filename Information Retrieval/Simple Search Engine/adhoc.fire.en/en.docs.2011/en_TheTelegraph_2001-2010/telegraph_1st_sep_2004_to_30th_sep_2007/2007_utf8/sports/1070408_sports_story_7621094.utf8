 India win doubles 

Almaty: Captain Leander Paes and Rohan Bopanna won the crucial doubles rubber to put India 2-1 ahead in the Davis Cup Asia-Oceania group I relegation play-off first-round tie against Kazakhstan here on Saturday. 

Paes and Bopanna defeated Dmitry Makeyev and Alexey Kedriouk 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 on an indoor hardcourt at the Baganashil Sports Complex. 

Bopanna had no problems combining with Paes despite this being their first Cup doubles match. 

Bopanna, who had opted out of the previous tie versus Uzbekistan in February, will be aiming to make it three out of three in this tie when he takes on Kedriouk in the first reverse singles. One win on the final day will help India retain their berth in group I of next years zonal competition. 

If the Kazakh wins that battle of number ones, the tie will go down to the wire with young Karan Rastogi scheduled to take on Makeyev. A 2-2 situation may, however, prompt Paes to put himself on for the deciding rubber. (PTI)

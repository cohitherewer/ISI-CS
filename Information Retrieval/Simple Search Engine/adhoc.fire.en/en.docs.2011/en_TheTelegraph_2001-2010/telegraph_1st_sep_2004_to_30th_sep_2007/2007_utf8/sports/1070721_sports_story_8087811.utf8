 Poor start by Jeev 

Carnoustie: Jeev Milkha Singh had a bad day on his British Open debut as he carded six-over-par 77 in the first round on Thursday. 

Jeev failed to capitalise on a strong start with a birdie at the opening hole as he subsequently dropped five bogeys and one double bogey in the years third major. 

Playing alongside former US Ryder Cup captain Tom Lehman and Australian left-hander Nick Hern, Jeev started superbly with a birdie three on the par four 406-yard hole. 

But he started dropping shots on the back nine after turning in one-over. Jeev was particularly disappointed with his finish where he double bogeyed the 17th and bogeyed the 18th with some poor shots. 

It was lack of rhythm or no rhythm at all. I started well but after that, I didnt hit it good at all. I put too much pressure on my putts and didnt make many, said Jeev. (PTI)

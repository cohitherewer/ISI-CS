The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Buchanan man likely for Bangla 

Melbourne: John Buchanans righthand man Richard McInnes was likely to take over as Bangladeshs coach, reports said here today. 

McInnes, the Australian teams performance analyst, seemed the favourite to succeed Dav Whatmore, having coached Bangladesh at Under-19 and A level from 2003-05. 

I know first-hand what it is like over there and Ive had a lot to do with Bangladesh cricket, McInnes was quoted as saying. 

I have had discussions with them after Dav resigned (in April), and of course, I would love the challenge. 

Their results indicate they are becoming a lot more consistent and other teams wont take them lightly any more. 

Some of their young players, with some more experience, will become very good international cricketers.

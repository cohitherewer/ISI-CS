 Qatar hold Japan

Hanoi: Uruguay-born Sebastian Quintana fired a dramatic late equaliser to earn Qatar a 1-1 draw against holders Japan in their Asian Cup opener on Monday. 

Naohiro Takaharas close-range strike in the 61st minute had looked to be good enough until Quintanas deflected free kick flew into the top corner in the 88th minute.

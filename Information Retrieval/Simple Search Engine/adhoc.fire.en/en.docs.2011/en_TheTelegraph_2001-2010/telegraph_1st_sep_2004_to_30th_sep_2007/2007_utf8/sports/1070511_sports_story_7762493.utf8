 Were obliged to tour Zimbabwe: CA

Sydney: Australian officials say they are obliged to go ahead with their scheduled tour of Zimbabwe despite calls from the government to boycott the trip. 

Australias foreign affairs minister Alexander Downer wants the tour cancelled to protest Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabes regime. 

Downer was due to meet with Cricket Australia (CA) officials and the Australian Cricketers Association, but CA spokesman Peter Young told ABC radio the tour would only be cancelled if the safety of the players was at risk. 

The ICC policy is that its obligatory for all ICC nations to visit each other regularly unless its not safe or unless it is impossible for some reason beyond the control of the visiting nation, Young said.

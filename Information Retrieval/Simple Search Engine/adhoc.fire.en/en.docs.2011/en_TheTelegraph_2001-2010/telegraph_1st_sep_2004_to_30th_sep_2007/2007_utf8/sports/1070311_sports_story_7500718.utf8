Indian Wells: Former champion Martina Hingis cruised but top seed Maria Sharapova had to work a little harder to secure victories in their opening matches at the Pacific Life Open on Friday. 

Hingis booked her place in the third round with a 6-1, 6-3 trouncing of Denmarks Caroline Wozniacki while Sharapova rattled up 10 double-faults before beating Dutch player Michaella Krajicek 7-6, 6-4. 

Seventh seed Jelena Jankovic of Serbia brushed aside American Shenay Perry 6-1, 6-3 and Israels Shahar Peer, the 11th seed, knocked out Chinas Sun Tiantian 6-3, 6-0. 

Slovakias Daniela Hantuchova, the 2002 champion at Indian Wells and seeded 14th this year, was given a tougher workout before beating Estonias Kaia Kanepi 6-2, 2-6, 6-1.

London: Dinesh Karthik starred with a sterling 91 as India got off to a good start and then overcame second session hiccups to claim Day I honours in the third and final Test against England at the Brit Oval on Thursday. 

Rahul Dravid and Co. ended the opening day on a comfortable 316 for four with Sachin Tendulkar on 48 (132 balls, 5x4) and V.V.S. Laxman on 20 (37 balls, 2x4) at the crease. 

En route to his unbeaten 20, Laxman became the ninth Indian to complete 5000 Test runs. 

Things could have been even better for the visitors but for two unfortunate dismissals. Karthik was adjudged caught behind even though replays seemed to indicate otherwise, while Sourav Ganguly (37) returned leg-before despite the ball taking a big inside edge before hitting his pad. 

Having won the toss and batted first on a belter of a track, India were well served by openers Karthik and Wasim Jaffer (35) who shared a dazzling 62-run opening stand in 90 balls. 

Dravid then stroked his way to 55 and put on 127 runs for the second wicket along with Karthik in 202 balls. 

The Team India captains decision to bat first was vindicated. The openers exercised extreme caution at the start, taking 3.3 overs to put the first runs on the board. 

Jaffer broke the shackles, hitting two fours off a James Anderson over and a feast of rich strokes followed. He played some gorgeous shots to give India a brilliant start and was the lone batsman to be dismissed in the first session for 35. 

Karthik took 14 balls to get off the mark and survived a close call for leg-before off Chris Tremlett on five. 

But once Jaffer turned on the heat, Karthik opened up as he hit Tremlett for two fours in an over. Dravid took over from where Jaffer had left as he immediately creamed Anderson for two glorious fours. If his first four through covers was all timing and placement, his furious cut past point in the same over let out a clear message that the Indian captain meant business. 

Dravid kept the momentum going in the post-lunch session when he greeted Monty Panesar with two lovely boundaries through the off side. Another cover drive off Tremlett brought up Indias 150 in 34.2 overs. 

Then, as the clouds gathered around the Oval and the ball started to move around, England finally had some solace when Anderson castled Dravid. 

The Team India captain batted 130 minutes for his 55. He faced 101 balls and hit eight fours. 

Karthik made 91 in 218 minutes, facing 151 balls. He hit 10 fours and one six. 

The dismissals of both Dravid and Karthik in quick succession put the brakes on Indias charge but Sachin shrugged off his inertia and rode his luck, while Sourav looked solid as the seasoned duo joined hands to keep the momentum going.

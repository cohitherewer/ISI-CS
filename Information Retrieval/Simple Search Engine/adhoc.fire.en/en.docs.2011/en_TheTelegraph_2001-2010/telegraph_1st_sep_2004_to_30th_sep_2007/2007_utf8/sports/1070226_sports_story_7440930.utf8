 Indo-Bangla Games 

Calcutta: Bengal struck six gold medals to Bangladeshs four on the opening day of the Indo-Bangla Games here on Sunday. 

All the medals came from the pool with swimming being the only event to conclude on Sunday. 

The hosts also added three silver and six bronze medals for a tally of 15, the same number reached by Bangladesh with seven silver and four bronze medals. 

While Sounisa Das (womens 50m backstroke), Akbar Ali Mir (mens 200m IM amp; 400m freestyle), Esha Chakraborty (womens 200m IM), Triparna Paul (womens 400m freestyle) and Monalisa Mondal (womens 50m butterfly) brought gold for Bengal, Mohammed Jewel Ahmed (mens 50m butterfly), Mohammed Shahjahan Ali (mens 50m breaststroke), Mahfuza Khatun (womens 50m breaststroke) and Mohammed Rubel Rana (mens 50m backstroke) delivered for Bangladesh. 

Bengal also had a good day on the field with the mens and womens football teams defeating their Bangladeshi counterparts 3-0 and 1-0, respectively, in the first of the best-of-three-matches. 

The hosts also came up winners in volleyball, beating Bangladesh 25-23, 25-20, 21-25, 25-23. It was a much closer call in kho kho, with Bengal winning 18-17. 

The opening day was not altogether a disappointing one for Bangladesh, though, as they won 60-56 in basketball and 31-13 in kabaddi.

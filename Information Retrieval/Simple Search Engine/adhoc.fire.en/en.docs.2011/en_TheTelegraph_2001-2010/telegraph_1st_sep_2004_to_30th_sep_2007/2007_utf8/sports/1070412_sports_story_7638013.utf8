The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Injured Rohan out of Twenty20

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: If Sourav Gangulys nod to play the last two matches of the National Twenty20 Championship boosted Bengals morale, the squad received a setback on Wednesday when Rohan Gavaskar was ruled out of the meet. 

CAB joint secretary Saradindu Pal said: Rohan has a groin injury, and will be unavailable. Stand-bye Anustup Majumdar will take his place. 

The squad will leave for Ahmedabad (the venue for Bengals matches) on Friday. Sourav, who will play the matches against Madhya Pradesh (April 17) and Mumbai (April 19) will leave on Sunday. Bengal will open their campaign against Tamil Nadu (Sunday). 

Manoj Tewari will remain captain.

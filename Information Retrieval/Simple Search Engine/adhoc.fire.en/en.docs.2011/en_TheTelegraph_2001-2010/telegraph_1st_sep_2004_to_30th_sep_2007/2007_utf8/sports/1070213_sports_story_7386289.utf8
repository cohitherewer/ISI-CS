 Sehwag needed for big events 

 - Balance of the squad is good: More 

 Kiran More 

New Delhi: Former India stumper and chairman of selection committee Kiran More said Virender Sehwag may not be in the best of form at the moment but it was necessary to have him in the squad. 

Sehwag is a very useful player. He is not in the best of form but you take such players for the big events. There are no surprises in the squad. It must have been a tough call for the selectors to leave out Ramesh Powar, More said. 

[More, incidentally, had picked the same World Cup 15, chosen on Monday, for The Telegraph recently.] 

Approving the decision to include youngsters Robin Uthappa and Dinesh Karthik, More said: Both of them have been around for a while now. They will be a surprise element for the opposition. 

Robin has done well, has some solid performances to back him. Dinesh did outstandingly on the South Africa tour. 

The balance is good, with seven batsmen and seven bowlers and two wicketkeepers, More said. 

 The former wicketkeeper felt that fielding would be crucial for Team India in the World Cup in the Caribbean islands. 

Fielding is going to be crucial. It is not going to be easy for the bowlers in one-day cricket and they will need good support from the fielders, More said.

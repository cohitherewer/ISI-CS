 Becks worried about his image

Carson: David Beckham has been dropped on the doorstep of Los Angeles, wrapped in a package of a chic gray suit for fawning fans and anxious media. Now its time to see what he can do with a jersey on. 

After six months of anticipation, the Los Angeles Galaxy showed off their new $32 million man Friday amid cannon-fired confetti, a rock soundtrack and shrieks of glee. 

Becks will now treat a twisted ankle and settle into his Beverly Hills mansion before starting practice with the team sometime next week. 

His first game is against a familiar opponents Chelsea FC of the English Premier League on July 21. 

Before that, hell start trying to convince his fellow players, many of whom make about a 50th of what hell take in, that hes a devoted teammate and regular guy, something he had to struggle with even among his peers in Europe. 

The biggest challenge is the perception of me as a person, he said. Not with people around the US, but with my teammates. Im sure theyve read things and seen the circus and everything that comes with me, and thats possibly my biggest challenge. It was at Real Madrid and it will be here. 

He called the teams medical staff physios rather than trainers, part of a series of trans-Atlantic slips he made Friday as he tried to adjust to American soccer terminology, including the name of the game itself. 

Its football to the rest of the world, and Beckham kept getting soccer stuck in his throat. Ive called it football my whole life, he said, smiling. 

Calling it soccer is not a problem for me. 

At the moment it is because I keep getting it mixed up, but at some point Ill get it after a couple of weeks.

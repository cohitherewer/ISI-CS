 Donald role extended

London: Allan Donald will stay on as a consultant to Englands fast-bowling programme until the end of the Twenty20 World Championship in South Africa in September. 

Donald, whose initial five-week deal was due to end after Saturdays final one-day game against the West Indies, will continue working with fast-bowling coach Kevin Shine, the ECB said on Tuesday. 

We have an exciting crop of bowlers in the England ranks and Im looking forward to continue working with them for the remainder of the summer and the first tour of the winter, Donald said. 

Along with the Twenty20 tournament in South Africa, Donald will be working with England during the forthcoming test and one-day series against India. (Reuters)

 SA dont stand a chance: Warne

Sydney: Shane Warne has dismissed South Africas chances of winning the World Cup, insisting New Zealand and Sri Lanka pose a bigger threat to Australias title defence. 

The retired spinner said South Africa, who recently replaced Australia as the worlds No. 1 ODI team, lacked the flair required to win the championship in the Caribbean, starting on March 13. 

I dont think South Africa have a chance, Warne told the Australian Associated Press on Friday. Theyre very regimented. I know theyre rated the number one side in the world at the moment, but I dont think theyre the best side in the world. 

Warne said New Zealand and Sri Lanka loomed as the biggest dangers to Australias bid to win an unprecedented third straight title. I just like the way they play, he said. 

I reckon they have a chance with the small grounds and the way the wickets will play. Im sure theyll have very good chance. (Reuters)

 Landis will lose case, predicts Armstrong

Denver: Seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong says fellow American Floyd Landis is innocent of doping but he will lose his arbitration case, according to a newspaper report. 

Landis, a former teammate of Armstrong, won the 2006 Tour de France but tested positive for a synthetic steroid during the event. That forced Landis to go to an arbitration hearing against the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). 

Armstrong was quoted in a daily as saying the cards are stacked against Landis. 

I think conventional wisdom is that he will lose, because USADA has never lost a case, said Armstrong on Tuesday. 

The arbitrators dont ever rule for the athletes. Quite frankly the system is set up against the athletes. ... Unfortunately for him, I dont think he did it. 

Thats always been my position, but Im not sure that he is going to get a fair shake in this trial. 

Armstrong himself is at the centre of controversy again this week because of a new book by Irish journalist David Walsh, which alleges Armstrong and his teammates used creative doping methods to win his record seven Tour de France titles. 

It is just the latest allegations faced by Armstrong, who has faced a stream of similar accusations during his run in the worlds most prestigious cycling race. 

I always hear about it, I always read it, and I always see it and it always makes me mad, Armstrong said. 

But you know what? I sleep every night like a baby. I know what Ive been through, I know what I did and how I did it, I know the type of team I had. I believe that we were the best, and thats the thing that gives me the confidence to go forward. 

The good news there is that the people I want to affect, the people that I want to influence, they do not care. They could write a million articles that population of people does not care.

 Randell case

Melbourne: The sodomy case involving former international cricket umpire Steve Randell, facing a string of charges for sexually assaulting deaf children, was heard Monday in a Brisbane court. 

Among the 11 charges levelled against the Australian are five counts of indecent assault, five counts of unlawful anal intercourse and one count of indecent assault of a female. 

No date was set for the next hearing on the case, an Australian portal reported. 

The sex charges are the worst to mar international cricket world till date. 

Randell was jailed for four years in 1999 on 15 counts of indecently assaulting nine girls. 

All were aged 11 and 12 at the time of the assault, when Randell was teaching in a catholic primary school in Burnie, Tasmania, in 1981 and 1982. 

He was released after serving about two years and nine months of the sentence. (PTI)

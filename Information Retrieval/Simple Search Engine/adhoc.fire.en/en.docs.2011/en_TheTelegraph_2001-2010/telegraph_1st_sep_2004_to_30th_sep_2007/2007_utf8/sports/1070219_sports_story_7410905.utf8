Calcutta: After having drawn first blood, Mohun Bagan would blame themselves for Sundays loss. 

For the city giants, everything was going according to plan initially. There was boisterous support, the Sunday crowd being replenished by the parallel book fair; the match started on a high with Bhaichung Bhutia showing glimpses of his prime. But that was it. 

Treading with a weak defence and a confused midfield, the green-and-maroon brigade lost their way midway as Dempo held their nerves to equalise (Ranty Martins) and then settled the issue via MoM Climax Lawrence. 

The 2-1 victory in Round V of the 11th ONGC National Football League at the Salt Lake Stadium propelled the Goan outfit to the top with 10 points, while Mohun Bagan (with four points) plummeted to the bottom in the 10-team standings. 

Air India, who beat Churchill Brothers 2-0 in Mumbai, also have 10 points in their kitty, though they remain on the second spot on basis of goal difference (four). 

There was more misery in store for Mohun Bagan. Bhaichung limped away in the 66th minute after pulling a hamstring and had to be substituted with Dipendu Biswas. The injury was a minor one though, club sources said later. 

For the glamour side, the one moment of glory came in 25th minute. Mehrajuddin Wadoo, Manas Das, Jose Barreto and Bhaichung showed perfect co-ordination to give their team a much-deserved 1-0 lead. From a Mehrajuddin cross, Manas right-footer and Barreto header, Bhaichung netted it sharp. But their glory just lasted 11 minutes. 

In a pathetic defence lapse, Deepak Mondal and Fabio Cortez Vidal were left looking at each other dumbfounded and confused as tournaments top-scorer, Ranty Martins, equalised from a Peter Carvalho pass. With this Ranty took his tally to five. 

The coup de grace came from Lawrance, who surged ahead from a Ranty pass, breaking the weak Mohun Bagan defence and did not make any mistake in beating Subrata Pal.

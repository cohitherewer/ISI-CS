The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The selectors need to talk to me: Prasad

A CORRESPONDENT

Manchester: Venkatesh Prasad feels the national selectors should take him into confidence before picking the bowlers for any series. The bowling coach also said that he was happy with Munaf Patels fitness. 

Munaf went back from Bangladesh. He hasnt played too much cricket. Whats important is that the selectors need to talk to me in terms of how a bowler is bowling Its important to have a good communication and be proactive in terms of fast bowlers. I would like them to talk to me before the selection and I am going to give this proposal to the Board, Prasad said on Wednesday. 

I am pretty happy with Munafs fitness, I am just saying that I need to know from the bowler how he is bowling If there needs to be somebody else to make sure that he is bowling with the same intensity as he had been doing while playing for the country. 

Prasad stressed on the need to bowl in the right areas. Thats what everybody looks to do. 

He also felt bowlers needed to be handled with care. Whats important here is to make sure that they are managed well in between the matches. You cant do much during a game. And its 10 overs in a one-day game and it can go up to 25 overs per innings in a Test matchIts important to manage them well and give them enough rest and recovery period and also keep working on their strengths

 Klien to test for Spyker today

London: Austrian Christian Klien will test for Spyker at Spa on Thursday, a move that takes the Honda reserve driver closer to a Formula One race comeback. 

The move also casts a shadow on the possibility of Indias Narain Karthikeyan currently a test driver with Williams joining the Ferrari-powered team. 

Spyker are looking for a replacement for Dutchman Christijan Albers, whose contract was terminated on Tuesday owing to non-payment by one of his main sponsors. 

Meanwhile, Mark Perkins, the 30-year-old Indian drivers agent, said on Wednesday that Karthikeyan has a burning desire to be back racing in Formula One and would consider any option that helped fulfil his ambition. 

Narain is a racing driver and wants to be racing. He will consider any option that will give him a chance to drive in F1. He has an unquenchable thirst for F1, his agent said from Monaco. 

Perkins said the fastest Indian on wheels also had offers to drive in the GP2 series but F1 remains his ultimate goal. 

GP2 serves as a feeder series to F1, being run on the same weekends and venues as the elite Grands Prix. 

Incidentally, Narain and Spyker team principal Colin Kolles had a spat when the latter had just joined the Midlands-Jordan team management during the 2005 season. But Perkins said Karthikeyan joining hands with Kolles again was not just a probability but a possibility. 

Immediately after firing Albers, Kolles rang us up and asked if Narain would be interested. He knows he has the ability, he said. 

Perkins said Karthikeyan has improved as a driver after his experience as a test driver with Williams. 

Asked if it would be better to be a test driver at a top team such as Williams or to be racing with a lower rung team like Spyker, Perkins said, you have to remember that there is another European driver, Klien, who is also keen to drive for Spyker. 

Klien was already at the Belgian circuit as part of his Honda test duties. However Kolles said the test did not mean the 24-year-old was sure to get the drive. Karthikeyan has also been mentioned as an option. There are many elements to be considered, Kolles said. (AGENCIES)

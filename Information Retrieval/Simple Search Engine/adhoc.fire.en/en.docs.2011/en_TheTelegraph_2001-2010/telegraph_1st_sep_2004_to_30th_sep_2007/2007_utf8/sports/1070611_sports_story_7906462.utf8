Chennai: Mahendra Singh Dhoni and captain Mahela Jayawardene struck superb centuries and shared a record partnership to spur Asia to a 13-run win over Africa on Sunday, sweeping the Afro-Asia Cup series 3-0. 

Asia amassed 331 for eight after electing to bat first for the third time in the series, leaving Africa to attempt another spirited but futile chase before finishing on 318 for seven. 

India wicketkeeper Dhoni and Jayawardene added 218 runs from 178 balls, the highest one-day sixth wicket partnership. The previous mark of 165 was jointly held by Australias Brad Haddin and Mike Hussey and New Zealand duo Craig McMillan and Brendon McCullum. 

Dhoni hammered 139 not out from 97 balls with 15 fours and five sixes in a late flurry with Jayawardene (107) after Kenya paceman Peter Ongondos three quick wickets had made it 72 for five. 

Sri Lanka captain Jayawardene hit nine fours and two sixes to be declared Player of the Series. Ongondo took three for 35 and South African paceman Morne Morkel claimed three for 50 before the Asia pair imposed themselves. 

Earlier, Asia captain Jayawardene, who rested Sourav Ganguly, Zaheer Khan and Saturdays Man-of-the-Match Dilhara Fernando, won the toss for the third straight time and chose to bat. 

Like in the earlier two matches, the Africans neared the target, but could not surpass it. They failed to capitalise on a 117-run opening stand, though the sixth wicket pair of captain Justin Kemp (86, 76b, 3x4, 7x6) and Shaun Pollock (58 not out) came up with a superlative display, adding 122 runs in just 88 balls. 

Coming in at 159 for five after four quick wickets fell for the addition of 42 runs, these two South Africans turned the tide and kept the bowlers at bay with their quick-fire display.

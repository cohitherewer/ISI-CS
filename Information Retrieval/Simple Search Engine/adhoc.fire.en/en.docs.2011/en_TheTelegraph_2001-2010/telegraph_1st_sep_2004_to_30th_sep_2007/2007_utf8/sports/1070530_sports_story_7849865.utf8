 Donald aims to instil some venom

 Allan Donald 

Former South Africa fast bowler Allan Donald wants to put some venom back into Englands bowling following his appointment to Peter Moores coaching team. 

Donald arrives in England later this week to work alongside Moores as fast bowling coach in a consultancy capacity for the third and fourth Tests against the West Indies, followed by the ODI series. If all goes well Donald, who has given up his job as a coach in South Africas High Performance department, hopes to secure a full-time contract with England. 

I hope that I can improve the skill levels, knowhow and technique of bowling, particularly on the mental side, Donald said. 

At this level its not really about coaching people. They have got where they have got because they can bowl. Its more a case of using motivational skills to get England back to where they were, when they beat Australia two years ago. 

I think England have lost a bit of their sting and venom since then. If you look back to how they bowled against Australia they had Hoggard, Flintoff, Harmison and Jones all bowling at about 87mph, but in very tight channels which meant that Australia could not dominate when they batted. They were used to scoring at three or four an over, but England reined them in. 

He added: They need to get back some of the bite they had two years ago. 

Though Donalds international credentials as a player are undisputed he took 330 wickets in 72 Tests he is something of an unknown quantity as a coach. 

He has worked mainly with the youth in South Africa, and his only previous experience of coaching in England was a brief and frustrating one with Warwickshire Second XI two years ago, where he spent too much time in logistical detail. 

Donald, 40, is a Level Three-qualified coach, but admits that he will bring campaign medals rather than coaching badges to the England job. 

He has the advantage of knowing Moores well, having played alongside him in the Free State side that won South Africas one-day competition in 1989 and against him in club cricket in Bloemfontein.

 Maria battles into semis

Tokyo: World No. 1 Maria Sharapova battled her way into the semi-finals of the Pan Pacific Open with a 4-6, 6-0, 6-1 victory over Japans Ai Sugiyama on Friday. 

The Russian moved a step closer to a potential showdown with Martina Hingis in Sundays final despite struggling mightily with her serve. 

Former world No. 1 Hingis, chasing a record fifth Pan Pacific crown, reached the last four by pulverising Australias Samantha Stosur 6-0, 6-1. 

Sharapova admitted her erratic serve was causing her concern.

 Ranadeb Bose and Manoj Tiwary are likely to share the Cricket Association of Bengals best cricketers award this year. Since both players earned the India call-up, it would be difficult to leave out one in choosing the best, a source said. Meanwhile, Satrajit Lahiri and Rajib Dutta may be named coaches in the junior categories. The proposals are now likely to be placed to the president and then to the working committee for approvals. Two under-17 coaches Madan Ghosh and Palash Nandy are likely to be retained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Team India take it easy

London: The Indian cricket team is currently enjoying a two-day break at a resort in Southampton. 

The break is aimed at giving the cricketers time to unwind and gel as a team before the series against England gets underway. 

The players, however, practised for about 75 minutes, including some indoor sessions due to rain interruptions. 

The team will reach Brighton on Friday to prepare for a four-day warm-up match against Sussex which begins in Hove on Saturday. The players will shift to Hove only on Saturday. 

The first Test against England gets underway at Lords on July 19. (PTI)

 Moments that rocked Big w

 all-white Wimbledon

1. The mens final 

Ok, Roger Federer against Rafael Nadal was more bash-crash-thrash than Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe ever were on Centre Court, mainly as a result of the advances in racket technology. But Federer is certainly not a power-head, as he has such an all-court and elegant game, which he demonstrated on Sunday with the intelligent touches, angles and ideas off his strings. Borg loved the way that Federer played, with so many different shots at his disposal on the way to equalling the Swedes record of five Wimbledon titles in a row. 

Nadal also had a few stylish and inventive moments when it was not just about smacking the yellow felt off the ball, such as when he hit a backhand pass while sitting on his backside on the baseline. Technology, although it has changed tennis with snazzier rackets and Hawk-Eye, does not dominate the sport in the way that the scientists, engineers and technicians do in Formula One. 

Indeed, there was probably more artistry and elegance in one of Federers backhands than there was in the entire Silverstone pit lane at the weekend. On Centre Court, we were watching humans, not machines. ITVs coverage of the Lewis Hamilton Grand Prix peaked at 5.1 million, but on the BBC, the Wimbledon mens final drew an audience of 7.3 million viewers. 

Still, such was the power that Federer and Nadal were capable of it was a surprise that health-and-safety did not insist on them playing in crash helmets with the visors pulled down. 

2. The rain 

The wet weather prompted suggestions that it was the worst Wimbledon ever. But the rain was not all that bad, as it led to this announcement from the referees office during one of the thunderstorms, a brighter moment during the greyness: People are walking around with umbrellas up. Lightning and umbrellas dont go well together we suggest you take them down. 

3. Red knickers 

If you are a female tennis player, then the fast track to tennis fame at Wimbledon is to wear interesting underwear, a trick performed by Tatiana Golovin with a pair of red knickers which risked breaking the All England Clubs predominantly white clothing rule. If Golovin goes out early again next year, put her in the Big Brother house. 

4. Hawk-Eye 

One effect of Hawk-Eyes introduction this year on Centre Court and No. 1 Court was that Cyclops, the machine watching the service lines with an infra-red beam, was moved elsewhere. This, unfortunately, meant the show-court crowds were denied what has traditionally got the biggest laugh in tennis, when a bird lands on the grass mid-match and sets off the Cyclops beep. Still, at least the crowds could still enjoy the hilarity of a ball getting stuck in the net, a serve smacking into a line-judge, or, even better, someone shouting out Cmon Tim when Henman had long since departed the tournament. 

Federer is the most vocal opponent of Hawk-Eye, even asking during Sundays victory over Rafael Nadal whether the technology could be switched off. However, it is highly unlikely that Hawk-Eye will be dumped after its first year. 

5. Complaining Russians 

Marat Safin remarked that the pasta in the competitors restaurant was over-priced, but at least his complaint was made with some charm and humour. Safin is a likeable guy. But Nikolay Davydenko is not. Davydenko described Wimbledon as the worlds most boring tournament. Theres hardly anything to do apart from tennis. You constantly find yourself yawning, theres no entertainment here, said Davydenko, the world No. 5 at tennis, but the world No. 1,197 when it comes to star quality. If Davydenko is concerned that Wimbledon is boring, then one way he could liven it up next year would be for him not to turn up. 

6. Accusations of gamesmanship 

My career is actually more stellar than Michael Stichs, Serena Williams said in response to suggestions from the German that she made the most of a calf injury during her fourth-round match against Daniela Hantuchova. 

7. Romance? 

The Wimbledon mixed doubles winners, Jamie Murray and Jelena Jankovic, certainly seemed to be enjoying each others company at the champions dinner at The Savoy on Sunday night. 

I know that there has been a lot of speculation about how well Jelena and I are getting on, but I can assure you that nothing is going on, Murray said on Monday. I know what people have been saying about our relationship, but its just like a brother and a sister. 

The are-they, arent-they debate almost made up for the will-he, wont-he story about his younger brother, Andy, which dominated the run-in to Wimbledon, with the British No. 1 pulling out of the singles on the eve of the tournament because of his damaged wrist. Andy Murray, who lost all the fourth-round points he picked up last year, on Monday dropped out of the top 10, falling five spots to No 13. 

8. A bathroom break 

Tennis is probably the only sport in which going to the loo is controversial, with Feliciano Lopezs bathroom break before the fifth set helping him to check Tim Henmans momentum in their second-round match. The Spaniard won. 

9. Grace Jones 

Pierce Brosnan came in and got all the publicity for inspiring Marion Bartoli to victory over Justine Henin in the semi-finals. But the former James Bond wasnt there for the final. Jones was. Jones was always there during the fortnight. The Bond villain in A View to a Kill, was usually seen in sunglasses and a black hooded top, with a plaster-cast on her hand and wrist, sipping a glass of Pimms. She cheered Venus Williams on to victory against Bartoli. 

10. Federers retro outfit 

What can the world No. 1, in his smart blazer and trousers, do for an encore next year? A top hat perhaps? Tails? White tie?

 Lack of menace not an obstacle for Anderson

 - I enjoy taking the first over I like having that responsibility 

Derek Pringle in Bridgetown 

It has probably gone unnoticed amid the general malaise surrounding Michael Vaughans team in this World Cup, but Englands bowlers have performed pretty well so far. True, they may not have taken the big wickets at big moments, but there has been a consistency rarely present over the past few years. 

They will have to be at their best against South Africa on Tuesday, a match England must win if they are to retain any chance of reaching the semi-finals. With the pitch at Kensington Oval proving fruity for batsmen, the match will probably be decided by the bowling attack that poses the most problems. 

The leader of Englands attack, in that he propels the first ball, is James Anderson, though if you take leader in its stricter sense as someone with authority over others there is no more improbable one than the diffident Anderson. But that lack of menace has not prevented him bowling with distinction. 

Nobody should be surprised. Anderson, 24, may sport the kind of lost-look worn by ejected members of boy bands, but this is his second World Cup his name and reputation as an exciting talent made after a four-wicket burst against Pakistan in Cape Town during the last one. Yet there is scarcely the whiff of veteran about him either, the result of a remodelled bowling action and a run of injuries giving the impression of a career only just under way. 

If we get ourselves into a good position first, then it is South Africa who could be the ones to fold first, said Anderson. If we can put them under early pressure, they have shown in the past that they do struggle. 

Troy Cooley, Englands former bowling coach, was behind the changes to Andersons action. Injury prevention was Cooleys main concern after Andersons wonderfully supple follow-through placed pressure on his neck. The rejig was not a smooth one and Anderson initially lost his control and confidence. 

I enjoy taking the first over and trying to set the tone for the innings, Anderson said. I like having that responsibility 

The results have been impressive. His 4.3 runs per over conceded against the Test-playing countries here is second only to Andrew Flintoff, with 3.47. Given that Andersons first spell is during the first powerplay and his second often at the death, his frugality is impressive. 

Andersons ability to swing the new ball should have brought him more than the four wickets he has so far taken against the bigger teams. Perhaps a predominance of left-handed openers has been a factor, with swing coming into the pads easier to play than when it leaves right-handers. But captains like reliability, too, and in that Anderson has excelled. 

He thinks the boom or bust nature of Tuesdays match will suit the team. 

This situation does bring out the best in us, Anderson said. We know exactly what weve got to do and we cant go in there half-hearted. Weve got to win the game, enjoy it, and show every bit of effort out on the field.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A liberating experience

 - One-day cricket 

 Gavaskar 

Mumbai: It was a great challenge for the Indian batsman to take the one-day game seriously during the early days and the attitude of the team changed in the early 80s during the Australia tour while taking part in a triangular tournament, former captain Sunil Gavaskar said. 

When India played their first one-dayer, it was a great challenge for the batsman to take the one-day game seriously. There was simply no thought given at that time in one-day cricket. 

Though we had the greats, the Mumbai school of batsmanship that was used to play along the ground was there. The cricketing upbringing was not to lift the ball an inch above the ground It was a long time before the Indian batsman could shed that away and play shots safely over the infield, Gavaskar said at a book release function. 

Teams would make a mistake if they do not take Twenty20 seriously, it might be the saviour of one-day cricket as the way one-day format was a saviour to Test cricket, he said. 

What one-day cricket has done has been a liberating experience, it had liberated from the shackles of playing along the ground.

 Bangla may play tri-series in India

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Chittagong: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah hinted on Saturday that Bangladesh may feature in a tri-series during Pakistans tour of India in November. 

India are scheduled to host Pakistan in three Tests and five ODIs, before heading Down Under. 

We will try and work out a tri-series, involving Pakistan and Bangladesh, said Shah, who is here as part of a BCCI delegation. 

During the day Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) officials held a meeting with BCCI president Sharad Pawar on the issue. 

It has been learnt that since Indias international calendar is cramped, a bilateral series will not be possible this year. 

But plans are on to convert the proposed India-Pakistan ODI series in November into a tri-series. 

In another development, Shah also said sending two separate squads for the upcoming tours of Ireland and England was a possibility. 

In Ireland, India will play a three-match series versus South Africa and another match against the hosts. 

We will take on England soon after the tour of Ireland. So, theres a possibility of trying out youngsters in Ireland. However, selectors will have the final say on this, the BCCI secretary pointed out.

 Shields not taking leave, say police

Kingston: Jamaica police have denied that deputy commissioner Mark Shields would be taking a break from the investigation into Bob Woolmers death to go home for Easter. 

Communications director for the Jamaica Constabulary Force Karl Angel has dismissed a report that deputy commissioner of police in charge of crime, Mark Shields, is set to go on leave, Radio Jamaica reported. 

Angel told our news centre Monday that while Shields did apply for leave earlier this year, he has requested that it be deferred due to the investigation, the report claimed. 

A London daily had reported that Shields, a former Scotland Yard detective from Britain, would not be changing his plans for the break.

 Abramovich keeps faith in Mourinho

THE TIMES, LONDON 

Jos Mourinho will be given one more year in which to bring the Champions League trophy to Chelsea, with the club already plotting how to improve their challenge next season. Despite his souring personal feelings towards the manager, Roman Abramovich has indicated his willingness to fund another spending spree, with up to half a dozen new players likely to be recruited. 

The relationship between Abramovich, the owner, and Mourinho may never recover entirely after the rows that broke out at Stamford Bridge earlier in the season and no talks are scheduled to facilitate a reconciliation, but there is a grudging acceptance on both sides that they remain good for each other. 

Having scoured the world for a potential replacement with soundings made to the likes of Roberto Mancini, Frank Rijkaard and Jergen Klinsmann Abramovich has concluded that no one is available who can do the job better. Mourinho, in turn, has ended his flirtation with Real Madrid. 

Meanwhile, it was confirmed that Phillip Carter, a vice-president of Chelsea, was killed along with his teenaged son Andrew, best friend Jonathan Waller and pilot Stephen Holdich after their helicopter crashed close to their home on Tuesday night.

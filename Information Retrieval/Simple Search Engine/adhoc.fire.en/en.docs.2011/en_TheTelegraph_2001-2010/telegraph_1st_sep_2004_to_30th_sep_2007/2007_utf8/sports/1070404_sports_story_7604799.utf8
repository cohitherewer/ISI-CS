 Unsolved puzzles in Woolmer death

 - The world keeps waiting for a headway in investigation 

Donald Trelford

Bob Woolmer never seemed like a man of mystery, yet his death has given rise to a number of puzzling questions that touch on the integrity of the game he served all his adult life. 

The first and most mysterious puzzle, of course, is who, if anyone, murdered him? A second is how such a decent man and I have no reason to doubt the verdict of those who knew him best could have been coach to South Africa and Pakistan at times when they were the most scandal-ridden teams in the world. 

Was it, as a friend of mine suggested when the shocking news first emerged from Room 374 in the Pegasus Hotel in Kingston, that Woolmer simply assumed everyone else was as nice as he was? His purblind faith in his friend Hansie Cronje can be held to support the case for naivety. 

A third, albeit irrelevant question now is why, if he was acknowledged for many years as one of the worlds leading coaches, his own country never employed him? 

The most far-reaching question, however, remains: was his death linked to endemic corruption in the game? While in Britain we wait with varying degrees of impatience for the results of the police inquiry, in the countries most often cited in this connection, India and Pakistan, the jury has already brought in a unanimous verdict of guilty. 

Take this, for example, from an Indian paper. The worlds administrators will try and dismiss Woolmers death as a one-off crime, rather than a malign disease on the body of the game. Greed will screen the truth. It is in the interests of crickets administrators to pretend they cannot smell the stink of corruption, since cricket has given them budgets beyond their wildest fantasies. 

The authors conclusion is surely beyond argument: If the murder is linked to betting syndicates, then the game either finds the will to change its structure or it will die an ignoble death. 

In Pakistan the power of cricket is such that when I interviewed General Musharraf, my ice-breaker was: Mr President, I must apologise on behalf of my country. 

Do you mean for colonialism? he replied, faintly puzzled. 

No, I said, for the fact that an English umpire gave your captain out lbw yesterday when he clearly wasnt. 

From that moment on, we were bosom pals. 

The same tactic would not be so effective, I suspect, with Messrs Blair, Brown or Cameron.

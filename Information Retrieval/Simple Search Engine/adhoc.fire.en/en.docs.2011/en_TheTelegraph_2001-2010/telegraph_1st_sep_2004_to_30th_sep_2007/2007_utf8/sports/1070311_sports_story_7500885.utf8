 Woolmer banks on team spirit

Port of Spain: Pakistans World Cup preparations were hit by countless setbacks. Instead of being torn apart, the team has emerged as a stronger unit, claims coach Bob Woolmer. 

Our team spirit is good and its something that we continue to work on all the time because its a fragile thing, Woolmer said, adding, If things go wrong, team spirit is tested and in Pakistan, over the last six and half months, things didnt go according to plan. 

Pakistan lost allrounder Abdul Razzaq to a knee injury, then pace bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif were ruled out with injuries. Even if they had been fit, the two were under a drug cloud. 

With Wada and ICC trying to get involved, this (dope cloud) was hanging over their heads, Woolmer said. So its best theyre not here. (AP)

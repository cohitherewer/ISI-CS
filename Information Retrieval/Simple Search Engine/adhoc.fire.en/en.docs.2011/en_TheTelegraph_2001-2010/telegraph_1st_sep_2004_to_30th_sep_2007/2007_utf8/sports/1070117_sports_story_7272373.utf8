 Vaughan doubtful vs Australia 

Hobart: England captain Michael Vaughan could be missing his teams next tri-series match against Australia after straining his left hamstring on Tuesday. 

Vaughan suffered the injury while fielding in Englands win over New Zealand in Hobart. 

He was able to bat, scoring 17 off 29 balls, but needed the help of a runner and was later ordered to undergo a scan. 

Englands next game is against Australia in Brisbane on Friday but Vaughan said he was unlikely to play. 

If I am honest, at the minute it is extremely doubtful, Vaughan said. 

Ive not had a hamstring injury before and it is new to me in that I dont know how they react overnight or what it will be like getting on a plane. 

Vaughan, 32, has only just returned to the England fold after two operations on his right knee. 

He missed more than a year of international cricket including the Ashes Tests but was recalled for the triangular one-day series after passing a fitness test.

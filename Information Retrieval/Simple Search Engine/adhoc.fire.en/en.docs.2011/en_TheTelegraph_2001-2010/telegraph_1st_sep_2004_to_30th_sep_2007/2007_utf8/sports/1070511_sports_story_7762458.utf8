 Dhoni, Karthik steer India to five-wicket win

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Dhaka: The World Cup is now history. The Indians dont wish to talk about it. Ravi Shastri has managed to instil a new sense of confidence in them and that showed in their performance on Thursday. 

It was important to start the tour on a positive note and Rahul Dravids men buried the ghost of Port of Spain at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium. 

It was a little after 5.30 pm when Mahendra Singh Dhoni hit the winning runs, sparking wide grins and celebrations in the dressing room balcony. The sense of relief was palpable. 

If Dhonis unbeaten 91 (106 balls, 7x4) will go down as one of his best knocks, Dinesh Karthiks 58 not out (60 balls, 4x4) will also rank very high. The pair added 107 in 108 balls to set up the five-wicket victory. 

Nothing could stop Dhoni. Bothered by cramps for most part of his innings, he kept going. At times, he was limping and struggling to stretch himself onto the front foot. Yuvraj Singhs coming in as a runner did help, but the pain stayed. 

Even a beamer from a frustrated Shahdat Hussain the pacer apologised on the spot failed to disturb his concentration. 

The conditions were tough. The energy-sapping heat and humidity was taking its toll. Having kept wickets for 47 overs after a 45-minute rain delay forced the curtailment and then go to bat after just 29 deliveries in the Indian innings was not easy under the circumstances. 

No doubt, the decision to bring him at No.3 proved a masterstroke. It was not a typical Dhoni knock. There was no show of flamboyance, and he had to work hard for every run. With the Bangladesh spinners throwing a tight leash on this slow and two-paced wicket, Dhoni and Karthik waited patiently and concentrated on the ones and twos. 

The batsmen, however, survived chances too Dhoni a confident leg-before shout and Karthik came through a close run out chance when Mohammed Rafique faltered in gathering at the bowlers end. 

India needed their batsmen to cover the deficiencies on the field. Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag may not have lasted long but they managed to set the momentum. Sehwag, in particular, was in his elements hitting seven boundaries in his 30. 

When Yuvraj fell to one that stopped on him, India were 63 for three and the target of 251 seemed far and away. The home team and crowd sensed another opportunity. 

Dravid added 49 with Dhoni before a tired shot led to the India captains downfall. Another soft dismissal a little later reduced India to 144 for five and the match seemed to be drifting away. Dhoni and Karthik not only arrested the slide, but made the most of every opportunity the Bangladeshis offered. 

In the euphoria of the victory, the lapses in bowling and fielding will not be forgotten. And as Shastri warned, a lot of hard work needs to be done. 

Even the presence of a bowling coach has done very little to improve their performance. Unable to bear the waywardness of Zaheer Khan, Venkatesh Prasad was pacing up and down the boundary ropes passing on instructions as early as the fifth over. 

One Tamim Iqbal had changed Bangladeshs fortunes in the Caribbean. The sight of the lefthander stepping out and clouting Zaheer for a six on that fateful afternoon will not be forgotten in a hurry. 

On Thursday, he again set the momentum with his lethal intention. Zaheer, once more, turned out to be his favourite. 

Despite knowing his strengths, Zaheer consistently pitched the ball up on his off stump. Tamim gleefully accepted the invitation, driving with elan and playing over the infield. 

The momentum was not lost during his 53-ball 45 as Bangladesh took control. Javed Omar held the innings together with a stodgy 80 off 116 balls an innings which also drew praise from Dravid. No less important was Saqibul Hasans 50. 

Even years of experience hasnt taught Zaheer to keep a cool head in the face of adversity. Bangladesh gambled upon disturbing his rhythm and it paid off. He went for 33 in his first five overs and the Indian bowlers failed to turn it around. 

Sreesanth was the sole exception. His efforts were though limited to a tidy opening spell as cramps suffered during fielding restricted him from completing his quota. 

In the end, though, Dhonis knock became the talking point. Bangladesh couldnt produce anything extra to eclipse his efforts.

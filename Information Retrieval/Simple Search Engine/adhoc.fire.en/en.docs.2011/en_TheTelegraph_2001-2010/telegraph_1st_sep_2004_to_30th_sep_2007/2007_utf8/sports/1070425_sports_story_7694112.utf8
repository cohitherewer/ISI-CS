 Police discard snake venom theory

Kingston: A Jamaican police officer has dismissed reports that snake venom may have killed former Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer, saying the theory was hogwash. 

The officer told a Jamaican newspaper that even though forensic experts found a poisonous substance in Woolmers body, the snake venom theory is hogwash. 

All I can say is that a substance was definitely found and it has been sent for further analysis, said the officer on conditions of anonymity. 

Earlier, police refused to divulge whether or not they were close to naming a suspect or making an arrest for the high-profile murder. 

They also trashed speculation that the fingerprint of a Pakistan player was found on Woolmers wrist. The investigation is progressing. I know nothing of a fingerprint, the officer was quoted as saying by the paper. 

The England-born Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room on March 18, the day after Pakistans shock defeat at the hands of minnows Ireland. (PTI)

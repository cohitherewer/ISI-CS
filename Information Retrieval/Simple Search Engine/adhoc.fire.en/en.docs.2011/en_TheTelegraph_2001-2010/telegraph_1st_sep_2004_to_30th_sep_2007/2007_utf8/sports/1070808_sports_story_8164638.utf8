Calcutta: Edmilson Marques, Ashim Biswas and Alvito DCunha served up a heady cocktail on Tuesday afternoon to drown Mohammedan Sporting in a goal deluge at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

In arrears, not once but twice, inside the opening 20 minutes, East Bengal turned the CFL Premier Division match on its head with some classy combination play, eye-catching individual skills and faultless finishing. 

Having made it 2-2 a couple of minutes before half-time, the red-and-golds struck thrice 10 minutes into the final session and added one more to complete the 6-2 rout. 

First a quick look at the goals. Basudeb Mondal scored off a free-kick with the clock showing not even two minutes. Edmilson drew level in the fifth minute. M. Sayju took Mohammedan Sporting in front again in the 19th minute. Edmilson made it 2-2 in the 43rd. Ashim Biswas netted two (46th and 48th), Alvito scored in the 56th and Edmilson completed his hattrick in the 73rd. 

The tennis-like scoreline didnt come as a huge surprise, given Mohammedan Sportings poor form. What was a revelation was the quality of the goals. Very rarely has a high-scoring game seen so many top-class goals. All eight were well-executed efforts, with Sayju and Alvitos probably the best picks. 

Sayju, from a couple of feet inside the 18-yard box, met Basudebs corner kick with a dream right-footed volley which struck the inner edge of the crosspiece and bounced in. 

Alvito, making his first appearance this season, took the fans breath away with a memorable solo. Getting the ball five metres inside the East Bengal half, the skilful medio dodged Basudeb and Sheikh Azim, screened Subhas Mondal before sending the ball like a guided missile into the far corner of the net. 

Edmilsons trio exhibited what a complete striker he is. The Brazilian showed good presence of mind when he found himself short of an Ashim centre from the left, but stretched out his left leg to direct the ball past diving goalkeeper Nasibul Haque. That was East Bengals first equaliser. 

The man who now has five goals in three matches brought East Bengal level a second time with an even better effort. Anticipating a 30-yard lobbed pass from Jayanta Sen by far East Bengals most impressive midfielder Edmilson rushed past the two central defenders and beat the onrushing Nasibul with a perfectly placed shot to the far corner. 

The hattrick goal was the result of a fine 1-2 between substitute Marlangki and Ashim, with Edmilson pushing home the latters cross without much fuss. 

Edmilson did not just score three, he set up Ashims second goal with a mesmerising 40-yard run three minutes into the second half. Ashim, showing a good strikers instinct, ran parallel with the Brazilian and was in position to divert the cross to the desired destination. 

Just before that, Ashim scored with a brilliant chipped shot after Alvito switched play from left to right like only he can. 

It was Ashims brace soon after half-time that hurt Mohammedan Sporting hard. From the comfort of 2-2, they suddenly found themselves in a 2-4 position. 

The first half had seen Mohammedan Sporting put up a spirited fight with Basudeb, Kulothungan and Sayju posing a question or three for the unsettled East Bengal defence. Once an injured Sayju limped off the park in the 37th minute, Mohammedan Sporting lost much of their sting. 

Those manning the defence were hardly equipped to handle East Bengals second-half surge. 

Its crisis time already for Shabbir Alis team. They have now lost two and drawn one for a solitary point from three games. East Bengal, on the other hand, have won all three.

 Injured Zaheer in doubt

Chennai: Indias pace spearhead Zaheer Khan is unlikely to make it to the squad for the upcoming ODI series against South Africa in Ireland due to a hip strain. 

The left-arm pacer suffered the injury while bowling in the second one-dayer of the Afro-Asia Cup here on Saturday. He bowled only 2.4 overs for the hosts before going off the field. 

Bangladeshi seamer Mashrafe Mortaza replaced Zaheer in the third and final match of the series at the M.A. Chidambaram stadium on Saturday. 

The extent of Zaheers injury and how long he would be out of action was to be ascertained yet. 

The Mumbai fast bowler was taken to a local hospital in the company of Indian team Physio John Gloster for an MRI scan of the hip.

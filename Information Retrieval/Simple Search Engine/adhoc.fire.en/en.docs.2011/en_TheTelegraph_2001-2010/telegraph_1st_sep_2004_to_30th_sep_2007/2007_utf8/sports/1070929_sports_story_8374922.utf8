 Baptista stunner in Real win

Madrid: Real Madrid returned to the top of the Primera Liga after a Raul penalty and a spectacular bicycle kick from Julio Baptista gave them a 2-0 victory over Real Betis on Thursday. 

The Real captain, starting up front with Javier Saviola rather than usual partner Ruud van Nistelrooy, who was rested, wasted several good chances but redeemed himself in the 67th minute when Betis defender David Rivas brought him down. 

Robinho scored in the resulting confusion and Real felt aggrieved to have the goal disallowed but Raul settled the matter when he converted the spot-kick for his third league goal of the season. 

The win left the champions on 13 points after five games and sent them back to the top of La Liga. 

Meanwhile, in Rome, Napoli will host Genoa behind closed doors on Sunday as punishment for their fans conduct at Wednesdays Serie A game against Livorno. 

Napoli fans had displayed an offensive banner, set off smoke bombs and thrown bottles, one of which hit the chest of a (referees) assistant, causing him pain, the Italian Soccer League said. (REUTERS)

 Police collect more statements

Kingston: Jamaican police investigating the high-profile Bob Woolmer murder case have collected more statements from Grenada and Barbados through two of its teams. The statements were collected by the two teams of Jamaican detectives which travelled to the eastern Caribbean last week, according to a report on a website. 

I sent a team to Grenada, and another to Barbados. They were received well. Local colleagues in those two countries were extremely supportive of the investigation, deputy commissioner of police Mark Shields was quoted as saying. 

And in fact, all those who we interviewed in order to eliminate (them) from the inquiry assisted the police with statements and all the samples that were required. So I am delighted with the outcome of that, Shields said. 

In the meantime, shields also said efforts were being made for Woolmers body to be sent to Cape Town before the end of the week. He said arrangements were being made for an early flight to repatriate the body. 

Coroner Patrick Murphy had Tuesday ordered the release of the Woolmers body. 

Pakistan coach Woolmer was found murdered in his Jamaicas Pegasus Hotel room on March 18, a day after his team was eliminated from the World Cup following their shocking loss to Ireland. (PTI)

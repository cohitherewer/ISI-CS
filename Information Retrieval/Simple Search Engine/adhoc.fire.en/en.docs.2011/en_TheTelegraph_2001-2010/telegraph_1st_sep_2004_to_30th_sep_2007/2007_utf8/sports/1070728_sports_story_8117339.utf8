 Poor start by Atwal

Omaha (US): Arjun Atwal returned a miserable four-over 75 to be placed at tied 150th after Day I of the $650,000 Cox Classic golf tournament on the Nationwide Tour. 

The former Asian tour No. 1 failed to strike a single birdie and stumbled to four bogeys. 

Atwal would have to come up with an exceptional effort in the second round to make the weekend cut here.

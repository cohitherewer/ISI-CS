 Pakistan still sceptical of murder theory

Karachi: Pakistan cricket officials and players continue to remain sceptical about Jamaica polices claims that Bob Woolmer was murdered during their World Cup campaign in Kingston. 

Due to the sensitive nature of the issue, they are unwilling to speak on record about the incident but they believe that sooner or later investigators and forensic experts will confirm that Woolmer was not murdered but died of natural causes. 

The Pakistan government was dissatisfied with the manner in which investigators in Kingston were approaching the case and hence decided to send their own senior detectives to Jamaica, to observe how the inquiry was being held, a PCB source said. 

The three-member Pakistan delegation, that also includes a diplomat, is set to leave for Jamaica but so far there is no confirmation on whether the Jamaican authorities have agreed to allow the Pakistani delegation to play a pro-active role in the investigations into Woolmers death. 

Everyday they come up with new theories about how Woolmer died. But from what our manager Talat Ali saw when they found Bob lying unconscious in the bathroom, they are more chances that he died of natural causes rather than being murdered, one player said. 

Sources say that when Woolmer was found in his bathroom, two things were evident, which weaken the murder theory. 

One that when the doctors checked him, he was still breathing and secondly, there was vomit all over the bathroom with traces of food. The theory that he may have been strangled thus becomes very weak under the circumstances, said one source.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Graham doesnt believe in frills

 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 

 Pat Symcox on Ford 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Pat Symcox 

Bangalore: Few, perhaps, know Graham Ford better than former South African allrounder Pat Symcox. He was, in fact, coached by Ford in Natal and was one of those to pitch for him when the South African board was looking to groom a successor to Bob Woolmer. 

Symcox, who is on the TV commentators panel for the Afro-Asia Cup, spoke to The Telegraph on Wednesday afternoon almost exclusively about Ford, the frontrunner for the Team India coachs job. 

The following are excerpts 

On having been part of the player-group which suggested that Ford be the one to succeed Woolmer (in 1999) 

(Grins) Graham and I go back a long way...

 Hed been the coach in Natal University when I was playing there... Then,

 later, he convinced me to come out of retirement and again play for Natal...

 At a young stage in his coaching career, Graham was fortunate to work with

 gifted players like Shaun Pollock and Jonty Rhodes... It helped his development

 as a coach. 

On whether Ford is an introvert 

He is, yes... You may find him having a couple of

 beers at the end of the day, but wont find him partying... Hes a private guy who has lived through the trauma of his wife (Elizabeth) having cancer... He has lived through the trauma of one of his sons being born with major complications... Grahams very committed and very strong in the mind. By the way, hes

 a fitness freak and has run three 90-km marathons... 

On Ford being regarded as a coach without ego 

Absolutely... Grahams never wanted to be anything more than a producer of quality cricketers... Youll never find him stepping in front of the players... Hes comfortable that way. Moreover, hes

 happy to bring in experts who could help make a difference. 

On Ford the coach 

He wants to build relationships and man management

 is his strength... He subscribes to doing the basics well... He believes in

 working hard and doesnt believe in frills... Theres nothing fancy about Graham the coach. Hes a cricket man through and through and you wont

 find him politicking... 

On what has made Fords man management

 special 

He can quickly understand where a player is at any point in time... He reads players well... Graham tends to become close to the players and is happy throwing balls if somebody wants an extra hit or will stand around if somebody wants to have an extra bowl... Grahams not the type who, for whatever reason, wont

 talk to a player for days. 

On Ford having been sacked by the South African board 

That was a sad day (in 2002) for cricket in South

 Africa... The match-fixing scandal broke less than a year after he took over

 and, really, Graham had issues to deal with. The records show South Africa

 lost only two Test series in his time and both were to Australia. Pollock didnt play in one and Allan Donald wasnt

 there in the other. So... (After a pause) Sadly, there was a lot of

 politics at that time and he had to work with some players who shouldnt

 have been selected... 

On whether Ford will be the right choice for India 

Look, its not proper for somebody from overseas like me to offer a comment... I cant say whether hes right for the Indian environment where the pressure is huge... What I can say is that Grahams

 very fair and very hard working. 

On Ford being the frontrunner 

Thats what I understand... One of the biggest

 challenges will be understanding the pressure that goes into playing for India

 and coaching India... The coach has to work within (clear) parameters. 

On his thoughts about coaches whove

 worked with Team India in recent years 

Its awkward for me to sit in judgement... However, whats disappointing is that despite such a big system, you keep looking for a foreigner... Surely, with such a big pool of former players, you can groom somebody... The impression I get is that the system has been allowed to deteriorate to such a point that youve constantly got to look at somebody from outside the country... Cant you have one bloke who can do the job? Ideally, when you get a foreigner, one of his roles must be to groom somebody from within the system. Im

 happy that (Venkatesh Prasad) Venky and Robin Singh now have important roles...

 Nothing should stop a specialist from becoming the head coach. 

Finally, on South African icon Donald becoming

 Englands bowling coach 

Oh, Im very disappointed... Allans helping England at a time our new ball-bowlers are getting old and losing sting... Allan, I know, had applied for positions within the South African system but, obviously, nothing developed... Its a shame... He should have been with our bowlers, not with (Michael) Vaughans

 men.

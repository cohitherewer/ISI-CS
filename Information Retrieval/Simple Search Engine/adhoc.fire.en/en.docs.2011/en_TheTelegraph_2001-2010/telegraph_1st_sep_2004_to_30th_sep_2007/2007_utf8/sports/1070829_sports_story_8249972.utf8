The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Ranadeb Bose 

Calcutta: There were five new faces in the CAB XI for the Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup, with the selectors deciding not to consider those who have joined the Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

Manoj Tiwary will lead the side and Ranadeb Bose will be his deputy. However, Ranadeb is most likely to wear the captains hat since theres a strong possibility of Tiwary making the India A squad for the series against South Africa A. The selection for India A will be held in Mumbai on Wednesday. 

Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who backed out after attending an ICL function in Mumbai, made himself unavailable due to a hand injury. Also missing from the squad with an injury is Sourashish Lahiri. Rohan Gavaskar will join the side in Hyderabad from Mumbai. 

Three batsmen Arindam Ghosh, Soham Ghosh and Partha Sarathi Bhattacharya as well as two left-arm spinners Iresh Saxena and Kirti Sarkar are the new faces in the side. Another rookie Amit Biswas will be included if Tiwary is called for national duty. 

Deep Dasgupta, who led Bengal to back-to-back Ranji Trophy finals, wished Tiwary and his side luck. 

All the best to the guys Bengal cricket will always be in my heart, the former captain said. 

Apart from Deep, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, Eklakh Ahmed, Shiv Sagar Singh, Subhajit Paul and Subhamoy Das have joined the ICL from Bengal. They will leave for Chennai on Wednesday for the ICL camp.

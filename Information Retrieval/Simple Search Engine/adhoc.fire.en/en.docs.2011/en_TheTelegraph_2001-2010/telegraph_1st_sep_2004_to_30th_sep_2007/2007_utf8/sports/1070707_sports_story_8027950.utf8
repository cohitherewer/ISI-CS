London: Marion Bartoli stunned top seed Justine Henin to reach the Wimbledon final on Friday, beating the world No. 1 1-6, 7-5, 6-1. 

The 22-year-old Frenchwoman, seeded 18th, produced a dazzling display to hit back from a torrid first set and book a Saturday showdown with three-time champion Venus Williams. 

Richard Gasquet tamed Andy Roddick 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 8-6 to reach the semis for the first time. The 21-year-old Gasquet recovered from two sets and a break down to upset the third-seeded American. 

Im so excited to be in the final, its a dream come true, Bartoli said after the biggest victory of her career. 

Henin, chasing the only Grand Slam title to elude her, looked invincible during a 22-minute first set, swishing away baseline winners at will. 

Venus, however, walloped and screamed her way into her sixth Wimbledon final with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over Serbian teenager Ana Ivanovic. Seeded 23 here after several injury setbacks, the American has overcome a shaky start to display the type of power play that has made her bid for a fourth title at the All England Club. 

At No. 31, she is the lowest-ranked player to reach the womens final since computer rankings began in 1975. 

She was taken to three sets in her first and third round matches and looked like she would not make it much further before raising her game to crush second seed Maria Sharapova and then fifth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova. 

Four-time defending champion Roger Federer, No. 2 Rafael Nadal and No. 4 Novak Djokovic reached the mens semi-finals. 

World No. 1 Roger Federer dropped a set for the first time this year, but still beat Juan Carlos Ferrero 7-6 (2), 3-6, 6-1, 6-3. Federer was broken in the first set on Thursday, when he and Ferrero played for 37 minutes before play was suspended by rain at deuce at 5-5. The 10-time Grand Slam champion won the opening two points on serve on Friday, and then easily won the tiebreaker after Ferrero held. 

On match point with Ferrero serving, Federer flicked a cross-court forehand that Ferrero couldnt reach. 

Nadal was broken once early in the first set, but didnt face any more serious challenges in beating Tomas Berdych 7-6 (1), 6-4, 6-2. 

Nadal had his first match point on Berdychs serve at 5-1 in the third set, but the Czech erased it with an ace. Nadal wasted another in the next game, but won when Berdych sent a forehand into the net. 

Djokovic needed exactly five hours to beat Marcos Baghdatis 7-6 (4), 7-6 (9), 6-7 (3), 4-6, 7-5. The longest Wimbledon singles match every played on one day lasted only five minutes longer. (Agencies)

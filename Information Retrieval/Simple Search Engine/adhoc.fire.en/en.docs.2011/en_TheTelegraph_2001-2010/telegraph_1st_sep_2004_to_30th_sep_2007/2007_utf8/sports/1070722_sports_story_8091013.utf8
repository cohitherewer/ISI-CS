 Brittle Indian batting crumbles again

London: India were looking up to their bowlers to bail them out of trouble after a spineless batting performance allowed England gain a sizeable lead in the rain-hit first Test at Lords on Saturday. 

Pace spearhead Zaheer Khan struck two early blows to check Englands progress in the second innings but two rain stoppages, each lasting about two hours, meant the Indians could not have a real crack at the hosts. 

By close on the third day, England had nudged ahead to 77 for two, an overall lead of 174. Captain Michael Vaughan (16) and Kevin Pietersen (15) were at the crease, and the two had already put on 34 runs for the third wicket. 

Earlier, the Indian batsmen failed to complement the bowlers good work and were bowled out for 201. 

India, chasing Englands first-innings total of 298 all out, had started the day on 145 for four with Sourav Ganguly and Rudra Pratap Singh at the crease. Neither lasted long. 

Anderson bowled Sourav for 34 in the fifth over of the day with an inswinging delivery. Sourav had added only nine runs to his overnight score. RP (17) hit two fours in one over off Test rookie Chris Tremlett before he scooped a short delivery from Sidebottom toward mid-off where Anderson took a running catch. 

Anderson struck again to remove Mahendra Singh Dhoni for 0. Dhoni edged a short delivery to be caught at third slip by Ian Bell and India were struggling on 175 for 7. 

Only V.V.S Laxman remained as a specialist batsman for India, and he soon lost partner Anil Kumble (11), who was deceived by a swinging delivery from Sidebottom to be out leg before. 

Laxman was also troubled by Sidebottom and was out for 15 when he edged a delivery to wicketkeeper Matthew Prior. 

Zaheer was the last man out Andersons fifth wicket when he edged the ball to Strauss at first slip for 7. 

Anderson also took the key wickets of captain Rahul Dravid and Tendulkar in Indias first innings after six months out of Test cricket. 

His last Test was in Sydney in January as he was dropped for the home series against the West Indies that England won 3-0 in July. 

Rains then delayed resumption of play after lunch by an hour and 50 minutes. 

Sreesanth was back to his wayward methods as he bowled at the pads of Cook and conceded two boundaries behind square on his first over. 

The Kerala seamer again erred in his length in the next over and Cook cut him fiercely to the point boundary. 

At the other end, Strauss got off the mark with an edged four off Zaheer that travelled safely through slip. 

However, the left-hander had no problems playing a glorious back foot cover drive when Zaheer pitched it up the next time. 

Strauss was then involved in a few verbal volleys with Sreesanth before he cover-drove him with relish to the fence to drive home a point. 

Zaheer then strayed down the leg side and conceded two boundaries by way of byes as Dhoni failed to stop the ball diving to his right. 

However, the bowler made amends very quickly by removing both openers off successive overs.

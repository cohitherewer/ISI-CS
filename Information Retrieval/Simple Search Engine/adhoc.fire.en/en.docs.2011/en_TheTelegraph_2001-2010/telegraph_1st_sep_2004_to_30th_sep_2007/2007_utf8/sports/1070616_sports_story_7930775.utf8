 CA policy 

Melbourne: Cricket Australia (CA) will quiz Ricky Ponting and his men on whether they use recreational drugs as part of its plans to draw up a tougher drug policy. 

According to a newspaper, Swimming Australia is about to introduce out-of-competition testing for recreational drugs and cricket and rugby boards will soon follow suit. 

Before CA puts in place a testing and enforcement regime, all cricketers will be asked about their personal drug use, the daily said. 

CA is reportedly under pressure from the Australian government. (PTI)

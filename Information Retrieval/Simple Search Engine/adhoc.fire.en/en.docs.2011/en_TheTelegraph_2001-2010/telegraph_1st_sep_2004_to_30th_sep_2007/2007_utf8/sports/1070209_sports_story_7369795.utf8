 Injured Vaughan out of finals 

Melbourne: England captain Michael Vaughan will miss the tri-series finals against Australia due to a recurrence of a hamstring injury. 

The 32-year-old aggravated his torn left hamstring in his sides 14-run victory over New Zealand in Brisbane on Tuesday which sent England into the best-of-three finals against Australia starting on Friday. The second final is in Sydney on Sunday and a third will be played in Adelaide on Tuesday if needed. 

Vaughan will return to Britain on Saturday, having been advised to rest for a period of 10 days.

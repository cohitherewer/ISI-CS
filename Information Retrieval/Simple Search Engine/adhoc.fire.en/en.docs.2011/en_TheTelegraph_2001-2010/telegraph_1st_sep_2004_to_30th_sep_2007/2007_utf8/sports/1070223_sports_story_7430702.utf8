 Dhoni mulls new plan

Ranchi: Team Indias dashing wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni has a new plan for the World Cup to keep the rival teams busy attempt a run-a-ball. 

The No.2 batsman in ICC ODI rankings on Thursday said he would strive hard to take at least one run every ball he faced in the quadrennial showpiece. 

I will try to play well and my effort would be to take a run-a-ball, Dhoni said at the airport on his arrival. 

No team should be taken lightly in the World Cup, said Dhoni, whose confidence is sky-high after he scored 223 runs in five innings in the recently concluded twin one-day series against the West Indies and Sri Lanka. (PTI)

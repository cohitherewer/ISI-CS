 Roddicks 4th at Queens

 Roddick, after his win on Sunday 

London: Andy Roddick saved a match point in the second set before beating Nicolas Mahut 4-6, 7-6 (7), 7-6 (2) Sunday to win his fourth title at the Queens Club grasscourt championship. 

The second-seeded American, who also won the Wimbledon warm-up from 2003-05, is the fourth player to win four titles at Queens Club. Lleyton Hewitt, Boris Becker and John McEnroe have also done that. 

Mahut was not broken once in the match. Roddick, who served 24 aces, had only one break point. That came at 4-4 in the opening set, but Mahut hit a low forehand volley to force an error. Mahut then earned the only break of the match to claim the set. 

Games went with serve in the second set before Roddick faced a match point at 7-6 in the tiebreaker, but Mahut netted a forehand and then made another forehand error to drop the set. 

Both players also held serve easily in the final set. 

On Saturday, Roddick said he was surprised by Roger Federers decision to pull out of the Halle Open this week. The Swiss had won the event from 2003 to 2006 and went on to capture the title at Wimbledon every time. (AGENCIES)

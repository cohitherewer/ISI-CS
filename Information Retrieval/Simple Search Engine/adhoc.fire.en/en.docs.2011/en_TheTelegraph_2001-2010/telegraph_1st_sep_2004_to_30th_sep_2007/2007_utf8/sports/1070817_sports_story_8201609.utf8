The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its crunch time for Subrata, Pereira

 - Referee will be under a lot of pressure: EB coach 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Subrata Bhattacharya thinks the referee will be under tremendous mental pressure while officiating Fridays derby clash at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

The East Bengal coachs comment on the eve of the Sahara CFL Premier Division match came hot on the heels of Mohun Bagans decision to play the match under protest and the IFAs unique step to form a three-member committee to evaluate the match officials. As of now, Fifa referee Subrata Sarkar is expected to be the man with the whistle. 

They (Mohun Bagan) are belittling an institution and its nothing but a pressure tactic. Though we have full faith in local referees, I fear tomorrows (Fridays) officials may commit mistakes under pressure, affecting our team, Bhattacharya said. 

No pressure, no diamonds so goes the saying. But Fridays big clash has taken a different hue for the teams. 

The moment Bhattacharya and Carlos Roberto Pereira decided to swap loyalties, they knew the importance of delivering early. 

There is a long way to go in the Premier Division and Fridays verdict, truth to tell, is unlikely to decide the champions. Its a fact that both teams have been suffering from trophy malnutrition at the national level and that is where the trouble is brewing from. 

Mohun Bagans stand on local refereeing and East Bengals decision to conduct a closed-door practice session on Thursday are interlinked with the fans high demands and optimism. 

Both coaches tried to play down the much-hyped build-up. This is not a big test of my coaching career, said Bhattacharya. 

Pereira was dismissive when asked about his former team. Dont ask me any question on East Bengal, Im a Mohun Bagan man now. Im under no pressure. 

These were comments to camouflage the real thought process. The fact is, the Big Two coaches are under more pressure than their wards. 

Like any other derby, there will be tension and pressure, but my team is prepared for the game, the Brazilian insisted. 

The statistic that Mohun Bagan havent lost to East Bengal in the local league after 2003 should give Pereira some comfort. 

If its a sense of purpose Pereira talked about, Bhattacharya referred to a sense of history. Taking Mohun Bagan for granted will be inviting danger. Ive been involved in such matches many times, both as a player and coach, and I know how to handle the situation. 

Pereira spelt out his strategy: he will use a 5-4-1 formation with Jose Ramirez Barreto being the lone man upfront and Subhashish Roy Chowdhury coming in place of P. Lalawmpuia in the starting XI. 

The coach, however, refused to term his XI as ultra-defensive and revealed hes expecting attacking sparks from his midfield especially James Singh, Dharamjit Singh and S. Venkatesh. 

This is the combination we have tried and tested in practice and I believe it will fetch me gold, he said, adding that Edmilson will be under zonal marking. 

The way we have shaped up makes me confident about a win tomorrow, Barreto said, before leaving the ground amid slogan-chanting fans. 

Bhattacharya, on the other hand, decided to keep his cards close to his chest. With midfield livewire Mehtab Hussain almost out of the frame with injury and Ashim Biswas to miss the game with a double booking, much will depend on how Alvito DCunha feeds Edmilson and Co. 

But its the rear line which is keeping the red-and-gold coach on his toes. Peerless exposed it in such a way in Sundays abandoned game that Bhattacharya had to bring in Madhab Das to stop the foreign duo in the replay two days later. Bhattacharya will again hope that Madhab will muscle out Barreto.

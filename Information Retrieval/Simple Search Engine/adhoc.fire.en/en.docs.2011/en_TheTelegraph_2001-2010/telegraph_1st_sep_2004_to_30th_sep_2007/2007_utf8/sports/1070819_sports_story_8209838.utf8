 Wenger banks on young guns

London: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger believes his youthful side have shown they have the physical presence to maintain their winning start to the season in Sundays potentially explosive match at Blackburn Rovers. 

It is a different Arsenal now, Wenger said on Friday. They are not going to let other teams kick them off the pitch. Arsenal came from behind to beat Fulham 2-1 in their opening Premier League match last Sunday then survived a physical contest to win a tough Champions League qualifier 2-0 at Sparta Prague on Wednesday. 

Wenger said Arsenal would be without Ivory Coast defender Emmanuel Eboue (ankle) and Czech Republic midfielder Tomas Rosicky (knee) but expected Brazilian-born Croatian striker Eduardo to be fit to make his debut.

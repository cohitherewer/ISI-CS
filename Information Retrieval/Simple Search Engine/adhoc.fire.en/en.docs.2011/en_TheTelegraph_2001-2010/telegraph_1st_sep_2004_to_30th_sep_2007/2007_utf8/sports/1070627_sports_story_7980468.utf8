 Qureshi fulfils dream

London: After once hitting the headlines for playing doubles with an Israeli, Pakistans Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi made his solo mark at Wimbledon on Tuesday. 

Qureshi, the first Pakistani to play in the Wimbledon mens singles in 31 years, beat Briton Lee Childs 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 in the first round. 

From the first point I decided to be aggressive. The main thing I was worried about was how to handle the pressure at Wimbledon, Qureshi said. 

Haroon Rahim was the last Pakistani to reach the second round here, in 1975 and 1976. 

I was very loose and relaxed on court today, he said. I dont think Lee expected me to come out today so pumped up and fired up.

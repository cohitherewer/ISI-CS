 Sydney: Australian-based Irish apprentice jockey Damien Murphy died on Sunday from injuries suffered in a race fall at a central New South Wales state track, his family said. The 23-year-old Murphy, who came to Australia 12 months ago, died after being removed from life support at a Sydney hospital.

 Hospital officials said Murphy never regained consciousness after crashing to the turf when his mount Ajays Luck clipped the heels of another runner nearing the finish of a race at Wellington on Friday. He also suffered a heart attack.

 Sao Paulo: Fifa may allow Romario to play for Vasco despite a regulation that would keep the striker out until June. Fifa prohibits players from playing for more than two clubs in a 12-month period, and Romario has already played for Miami FC in the US and Adelaide United in Australia.

 Fifa last week sent a letter to the Brazilian Soccer Confederation, however, asking if it had any objections to letting Romario play in a signal that he might be cleared to join Vasco before June.

 We said there are no objections, CBF lawyer Valed Perry told a paper on Sunday.

 Amsterdam: Midfielder Edgar Davids is to join Ajax Amsterdam as a free agent, the Dutch press agency ANP reported on Sunday. Tottenham Hotspur have given the former Dutch international a free transfer back to the club where he started his professional career in 1991, the agency said.

 Davids and Ajax reportedly agreed to an 18-month deal on Friday and if the 33-year-old passes a medical examination he is set to make his debut next weekend against arch-rivals Feyenoord. Davids helped Ajax win three league titles from 1994-96 plus the UEFA Cup in 1992 and the Champions League in 1995.

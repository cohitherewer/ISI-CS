 Stuart Broad savours a special day

Manchester: Englands young allrounder Stuart Broad said the moderate target set by India eased the pressure on him and Ravi Bopara in the fourth ODI on Thursday night. The pair snatched victory from certain defeat to help England take a 3-1 lead (as reported in Fridays Late City edition). 

We had plenty of time to bat, so there wasnt any scoreboard pressure. We didnt need five or six (an over) where we would have required outrageous shots, said Broad who played an important role in the three-wicket win in the day-night match at Old Trafford. 

We could just play each ball on merit and pick up runs that way. We kept talking to each other, kept it very simple and went down in 10s. When we got to 30-35 (remaining), Ravi said come on, this is not many runs, we can do this if we keep playing. 

We were aiming to win the game and thats what we did. It was fantastic to be involved in that. It was great to get four wickets and some runs, but more pleasing to win the game, said the 21-year-old. 

Broad took a career-best four for 51 as India were all bowled out for 213. 

The Leicestershire allrounder then battled to an unbeaten 45 in an unbroken 99-run stand with Bopara after England had slumping to 114/7. 

Its a special day for me and the lads. It was great to go out there with Ravi, said Broad, savouring his moment.

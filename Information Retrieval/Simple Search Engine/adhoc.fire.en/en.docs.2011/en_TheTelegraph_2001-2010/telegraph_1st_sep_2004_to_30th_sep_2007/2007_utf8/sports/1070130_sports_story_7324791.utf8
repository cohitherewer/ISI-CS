 Mourinho: I believe Ill be manager till 2010 

 - Chelsea coach hopes for double success 

 Jose Mourinho 

London: Jose Mourinho insists hes staying at Chelsea. If Wednesdays results go the wrong way, he might change his mind. 

An ideal outcome for Mourinho would be the Blues moving within three points of United in the Premier League and facing Tottenham rather than favoured Arsenal in the February 25 League Cup final. 

By contrast, if Chelsea lose at home to reviving Blackburn on Wednesday and United beat last-place Watford at home the same night, the Red Devils will be nine points ahead with 13 matches to go. 

Its also likely to be Arsenal facing Chelsea in the League Cup final. The Gunners have home advantage in Wednesdays semi-final second leg against Spurs after the two teams tied 2-2 last week at White Hart Lane. 

If that happens, there will be even more speculation about Mourinhos future at Stamford Bridge. Chelseas midseason slump is partly due to the absence of injured team captain and centreback John Terry. But Mourinho is also unhappy that he has not been given money to spend during the January transfer window, which runs out on Wednesday, and has reportedly fallen out with owner Roman Abramovich. 

Some reports suggest Abramovich wants to fire Mourinho after the season and replace him with a combination of Russia national coach Guus Hiddink and Barcelonas Frank Rijkaard. Inter Milans Roberto Mancini, whose team is 11 points clear in Serie A, has also been linked with a move to Stamford Bridge. 

Mourinho has responded to the continued speculation by saying hes confident he will see out his contract until 2010. 

I am manager today and until the end of the season and I believe Ill be manager until 2010, he said. 

Mourinho also said he would be a tough act to follow. I think it is difficult to be a manager after me at any club, so I would not recommend it, he said. I know the list (of possible replacements) is quite long 11 or 12 managers of Chelsea but even if the list becomes bigger it is no problem for me. I am cool but it is my desire to stay at Chelsea.

 Greig: Sunnys comments not appropriate

 Sunil Gavaskar

Melbourne: Former England captain Tony Greig has criticised Sunil Gavaskar for his comments on the behaviour of Australian cricketers, saying the comments were inappropriate. 

Greig was particularly unhappy that Gavaskar, a former Indian captain, cited the example of ex-Australian cricketer David Hookes to illustrate his point. 

Its inappropriate and I really dont see any great value in this sort of sledging, he was quoted as saying in local media. 

Greig, a close friend of Hookes, said he was shocked by Gavaskars statements, the latest in a war of words between him and Australian captain Ricky Ponting. 

Hookes tragically died three years ago after being punched by a bouncer outside a Melbourne pub. 

Peter Young, CA general manager (public affairs), said Gavaskars comments were unfortunate. Its very disappointing. The World Cup is underway and our players actions will speak for themselves. 

Former Australia captain Allan Border also took exception to Gavaskar citing the death of Hookes. I consider Sunny a friend, but what he said about Hookes and the behaviour of Australian cricketers was totally uncalled for It was totally inappropriate, Border was quoted as saying in a local newspaper. 

Border, 1987 World Cup-winning captain, said Gavaskar had a mistaken cultural view of the way Australia play the game. 

Where Australia may be seen to be playing the game hard and tough could be misconstrued on the subcontinent, he said. 

Border felt Gavaskar, also the ICC Cricket Committee chairman, had missed the point and overlooked the fact there were different cultures at work. I think he is drawing a long bow, blaming our cricketers for misbehaving. While I do admit words are said out in the middle, we play the game hard, but fair, Border asserted. 

Former Australian cricketer Darren Lehmann also joined in the fray. Im pretty disappointed with Gavaskar. His remarks only hurt Hookes family and friends and tarnish his memory. 

A man of Gavaskars stature should know better. His outburst about Hookes was totally out of order and in bad taste, he said. 

As to what he said about the way Australia go about playing the game, hes overlooked the fact there are officials who are empowered to take action if someone is out of order, he added. 

Lehmann also went on to say that he had lost respect for the former Indian captain. 

I came into the international arena a few years after he had retired. He was a player I admired not any more, Lehmann said. (AGENCIES)

Calcutta: Its finally official. Laxmi Ratan Shukla is not joining the Indian Cricket League (ICL) and will continue representing Bengal. I am not enjoying the idea of joining the ICL. My heart is with Bengal and I want to play for the country, said Shukla on Friday. 

I never signed the contract, so there should be no problem. I had gone to Mumbai to discuss a few clauses in the contract The atmosphere wasnt to my liking and I didnt feel comfortable. I felt nervous and felt it wouldnt be proper for me to join the ICL. I cannot play if I have a feeling that I do not belong in the place. My mind wasnt there. Hence the decision he explained. 

Shukla clarified that he did not hold any grudge against the ICL. They were very nice to me. There were no problems, financial or whatever. It was entirely my own decision taken in consultation with my family and friends. 

Why did he then parade with the other players during the presentation on Monday? That just happened. I was there to discuss the contract and couldnt say no I wouldnt say that was a mistake but something I wouldnt do a second time. Its not that I have committed a sin or a crime by doing so I just shook hands with a few legends of the game! 

Has he been pressurised to stay with Bengal? There has been no pressure. I called up a few CAB officials on Monday night itself and told them that I was not joining the ICL. I discussed the same with them on return and their eagerness and enthusiasm moved me, he said. 

Shukla vehemently denied being lured by the CAB with the captaincy offer. There is no truth in that I have not bargained for anything, he said. 

Sources have however confirmed that Shuklas name will be considered for captaincy along with Manoj Tiwary when the selectors meet next month. 

The CAB is also trying to lure Avishek Jhunjhunwala back into its fold. The problem is he has already signed on the dotted line. I was a bit surprised by his decision to join the ICL since he has a bright future. The position is slightly vague. I will talk to him, said president Prasun Mukherjee. 

To stop any more players from crossing over, the CAB is also planning to introduce a contract of its own. 

The CAB authorities, meanwhile, are confident of retaining Shukla and Sourashish Lahiri and they wont have to represent employers Railways this season. The duo however will not take part in the Moin-ud Dowlah meet.

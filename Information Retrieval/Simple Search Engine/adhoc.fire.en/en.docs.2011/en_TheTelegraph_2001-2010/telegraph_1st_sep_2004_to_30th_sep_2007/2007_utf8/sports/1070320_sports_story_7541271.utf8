The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I am extremely sorry, says Flintoff

Gros Islet: England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff said on Monday there would never be a repeat of the late-night drinking binge which led to him being stripped of the World Cup vice-captaincy. 

The 29-year-old was one of six players fined for a breach of team discipline following the six-wicket defeat by New Zealand. He was suspended for Sundays victory over Canada and stripped of vice-captaincy. 

I know that what I did on Friday night was completely wrong and I have to take full responsibility for it there can be no excuses on my part, he said. I know I shouldnt have done what I did and I have to accept the punishment, he had said on Sunday. 

To my teammates and the England supporters that I let down, all I can say is that I am extremely sorry and assure everyone that I will be giving 110 per cent for England for the rest of this tournament. 

After leaving a nightclub close to the teams St Lucia hotel, Flintoff got into a pedalo on the water in the early hours and later needed to be rescued after falling off it, according to British media reports. 

Theres no secret we had a few drinks on Friday. Its been documented in the press what happened afterwards with a little bit of poetic licence, a downbeat Flintoff told reporters at the hotel. There was water involved and a pedalo as well. But I dont want to go into detail. I dont think my life was in danger. 

Its something Im not proud of and something which shouldnt have happened. Being left out for these reasons is something Im upset about and I never want to happen again. 

More revelations about Fridays antics appeared in British newspapers on Monday, with some witnesses saying the players were so drunk in the nightclub they were kissing each other. 

James Anderson, Jon Lewis, Ian Bell, Paul Nixon and Liam Plunkett were the other players fined. 

England coach Duncan Fletcher was generally philosophical about the whole incident. 

I dont really feel let down. There are times in everyones life you need some discipline. I will always support Andrew, he said. The players can go out. Theyve been around a long time and know how to behave. 

Flintoff, who has slimmed down considerably from his early cricket days, would not comment in detail about having the vice-captaincy taken away but was focused on Saturdays final group game with Kenya. (REUTERS)

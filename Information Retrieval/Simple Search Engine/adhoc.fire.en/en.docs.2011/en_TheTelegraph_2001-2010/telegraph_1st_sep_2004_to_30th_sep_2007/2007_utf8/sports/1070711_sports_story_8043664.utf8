 F1 return a possibility

 - Narain an option: Spyker

 Narain Karthikeyan 

London: Indias Narain Karthikeyan could be in line for a Formula One comeback as replacement for dropped Dutch driver Christijan Albers at Spyker. 

Team boss Colin Kolles said on Tuesday that Karthikeyan was on his list of possible options. 

Yet another option was Austrian Christian Klien, currently the Honda test driver after three seasons with Red Bull and their predecessors Jaguar. 

For the moment, no other driver is signed, said Kolles. Obviously, Narain is one of the options I think hes a good option and we are just in the process of evaluating this. Williams are informed about this possibility, yes. 

Markus Winkelhock, already under contract to Spyker as a test driver, may however be drafted in firstat the Nuerburgring in Germany next week. Dutch driver Giedo van der Garde, one of Spykers other testers, does not yet have a super licence. 

The team said earlier on Tuesday that they had dropped Albers with immediate effect owing to non-payment by one of his main sponsors. A decision on the 28-year-olds replacement would be taken in due course.

 Big W not my priority: Henin

Eastbourne: Four-time French Open queen Justine Henin confessed on Monday that she would not be devastated if she never wins Wimbledon. 

But the Belgian world No.1 added that she will making an aggressive run at the only Grand Slam title she is lacking, beginning her preparation on grass this week at the Eastbourne Championships. 

To win all four Grand Slams would be a great achievement, Henin said on Monday, little more than a week after she beat Serbias Ana Ivanovic in the Roland Garros final. 

But I dont know if it would make me any more happy. But to somehow win Wimbledon would be amazing, it would be another great adventure. 

Henin said she was still riding the wave of emotion unleashed in Paris. 

I only arrived here last night (Sunday), she said in the rainy English seaside town. 

Henin said that she decided only at the last minute to keep her date at Eastbourne, the prime WTA tune-up for Wimbledon, which begins in a week. 

Im still not fully recovered but if Im here, Im here to play. I want to get a couple of matches here, said the 25-year-old. 

Henin said she spent the immediate days after her Paris victory with her family, with whom she has been slowly reuniting over the past half-year since splitting with her husband at the start of 2007.

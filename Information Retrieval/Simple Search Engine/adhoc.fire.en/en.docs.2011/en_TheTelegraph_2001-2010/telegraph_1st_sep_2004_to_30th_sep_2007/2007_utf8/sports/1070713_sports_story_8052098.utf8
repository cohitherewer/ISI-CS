 Lawson set for Pak job: Report

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided in principle to appoint former Australian fast bowler Geoff Lawson as their new coach, local media reported on Thursday. 

A newspaper has reported that it had been decided to name Lawson as the new coach when the ad-hoc committee of the board meets here on July 16. 

Initially the board had decided to repose faith in former Australian Dav Whatmore. But his appointment has been opposed by the players and manager Talat Ali who instead supported Lawsons appointment, the newspaper said. 

Sources also confirmed that the board had opened up final negotiations over finances and other perks with Lawson and had dropped talks with Whatmore. (PTI)

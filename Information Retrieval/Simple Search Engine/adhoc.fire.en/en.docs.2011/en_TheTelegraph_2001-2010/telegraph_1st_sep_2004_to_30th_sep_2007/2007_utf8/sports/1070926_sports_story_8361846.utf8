 Anand draws with Kramnik 

 Viswanathan Anand

Mexico City: Viswanathan Anand inched closer to regaining the World Chess Championship title after drawing with Russian arch-rival Vladimir Kramnik in the 10th round of the event here on Monday. 

The result took the Indian ace to 6.5 points and helped him retain his full-point lead over Boris Gelfand of Israel, who played out a draw with Peter Leko of Hungary. 

Kramnik, 1.5 points behind Anand, shared the third spot with Leko and Levon Aronian of Armenia. 

Russian Alexander Grischuk slipped to joint sixth (4.5) with compatriot Alexander Morozevich after losing to Aronian. There was no change in the fortunes of another Peter Svidler (4), who brought up the rear. 

With four rounds to go, there will have to be a major catastrophe for Anand to deny him the crown. The Indian GM has two white games left against Leko and Morozevich, while he will play with black against Grischuk and Svidler. 

According to experts, two points from his remaining three games should be enough for Anand. 

The battle royal between Kramnik and Anand lived up to expectations. In an exciting duel, Anand went for the semi Slav once again and faced the anti-Meran. Kramnik had to win to revive title hopes. Anand, on the other hand, did the needful after some real hard work. 

The middlegame saw Kramnik moving into the drivers seat briefly with his knight threatening to do some damage. Anand came up with a fantastic idea and gave up his rook for the knight. 

Anand picked up a couple of pawns and started pushing them to force Kramnik take some punitive measures. The Russian decided against further tricks on the 41st move and offered the draw. 

After a rather indifferent start, Aronian seemed to be finding his touch. Playing white against Grischuk, the Armenian came up with some high quality chess in the queen pawn opening and cruised home with a brilliant finale. 

In the end, Grischuk was just one move short of queening his central pawn, but it was checkmate on him. 

Gelfand went for his pet Catalan against leko and it seemed that the oldest participant was tiring out. Complications could have remained but Gelfand went for an easy equaliser leading to a draw through perpetual checks.

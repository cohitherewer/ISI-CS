 EB escape with draw 

 - Duley leads United SC charge against former Team 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: East Bengal were lucky to escape with a draw against Chirag United SC in their Sahara CFL Premier Division match on Saturday. 

United SC enjoyed allround superiority and, despite opening the rival goalmouth time and again, they were let down by poor finishing. The match ended 1-1. 

Had there been a Man of the Match award, Sasthi Duley would have walked away with it unchallenged. The former East Bengal medio set the momentum early with a brilliant goal from a free-kick and controlled the proceedings with authority thereafter. Enjoying good support from Gouranga Dutta (another former East Bengal player) and Achintya Saha, Sasthi sent tremors down East Bengals non-existent midfield and defence with his distribution. 

Theodre and Sankar Oraon also proved to be handy upfront. The former, though, was slightly off-colour in the second session after suffering a head injury. 

East Bengal were without three of their regulars Edmilson and Dipankar Roy were out with double bookings while Mehtab Hussain was injured and it reflected poorly on their bench strength. Besides surviving several close calls, a Gouranga shot and a suicidal Anupam Sarkar back header came off the post. 

Only Alvito DCunha and M. Suresh (in patches, though) provided some semblance of a fight. 

After conceding the goal in the ninth minute, East Bengal equalised through Bimal Pairyar almost immediately, heading in an Alvito corner. East Bengal never looked capable of making any more breakthroughs thereafter. 

K. Shankars supervision was of the highest standard and the pressure tactics often employed by the big teams never worked. 

East Bengal coach Subrata Bhattacharya blamed it on the youngsters inexperience and the panic among them following the loss to Mohun Bagan. These were excuses hardly enough to soothe the supporters frayed tempers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB wary of Sporting 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Pereira thinks Sporting Clube de Goas foreign duo Ernest Jeremiah and Dudu Omagbemi might pose a threat to his team ahead of their National Football League Round IX encounter. 

They have two very good forwards in Jeremiah and Dudu and so this team can be rated alongside (top teams like) Dempo and Mahindra United, Pereira said. 

East Bengal will miss the services of Abhra Mondal and Arata Izumi due to injuries. Rajat Ghosh Dastidar is certain to take Mondals place under the bar while S. Malsawmtluanga will start for the red-and-golds on at the Salt lake Stadium on Wednesday. 

On the other hand, the Goan outfit will also miss three of their key players Wilton Gomes, Jose Pereira and Sadanand through injuries. 

However, their coach Clifford Chukuwama was drawing inspiration from his sides past performances. We have beaten East Bengal twice this season and we always fancy a chance tomorrow, he said.

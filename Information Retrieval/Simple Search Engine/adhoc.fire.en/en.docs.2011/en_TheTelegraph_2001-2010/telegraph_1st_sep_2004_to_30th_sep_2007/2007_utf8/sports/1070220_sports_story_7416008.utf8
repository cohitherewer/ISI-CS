 NATIONAL GAMES REVIEW 

 New Delhi: Swimmers Rehan Poncha of Karnataka and Richa Mishra of Delhi hogged all the limelight in the just concluded National Games in Guwahati winning nine and eight gold medals, respectively, but it was Punjab weightlifter Sarabjit Kanda who created the biggest sensation of the Games. 

Participating in the plus 105kg category, Kanda, who is employed with the Punjab Police, stunned the spectators with a total lift of 370 kg, the first Indian to do so. His lift of 205 kg in clean and jerk was also equally impressive as no other Indian has done so before him.

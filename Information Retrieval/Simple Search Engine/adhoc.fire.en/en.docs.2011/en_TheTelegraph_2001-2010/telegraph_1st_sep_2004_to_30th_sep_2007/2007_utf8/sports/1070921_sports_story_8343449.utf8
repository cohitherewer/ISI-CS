 Shoaib could miss series vs SA

Karachi: Pakistans Shoaib Akhtar is unlikely to play in the Test series against South Africa because of a disciplinary inquiry into his conduct starting next week. 

Akhtar was sent home from South Africa a fortnight ago, before the start of the ICC World Twenty20 tournament after he struck teammate Mohammed Asif with a bat during a row. 

The fast bowler said all rounder Shahid Afridi had provoked the brawl and that he accidentally hit Asif with the bat. 

Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf told a news conference that the disciplinary committee would start its work in a weeks time. 

Asked if Akhtar would be considered for the Tests against the visiting South Africa, Ashraf replied: We will not interfere in the working of the disciplinary committee or the selectors. This is a serious issue and will be investigated fully. 

Jacques Kallis has been recalled to the South Africa squad for the Test series in Pakistan in October, adds a report from Durban. 

Kallis was left out of the ICC Twenty20 World Cup squad and reacted to his omission by resigning as vice-captain, saying he was considering his options. South Africa coach Mickey Arthur said Herschelle Gibbs would return to the top of the order in Pakistan. South Africa will play five ODIs in Pakistan after the two Tests.

 Sania-Vania in semis

New Delhi: Top seeds Sania Mirza and her American partner Vania King rallied from a set down to beat the Spanish pair of Nuria Llagostera Vives and Arantxa Parra Santonja and enter the semi-finals of the Morocco Open at Fes. 

Sania and Vania beat their rivals 3-6, 6-2, 10-5 in the thrilling encounter and will next take on the French-Venezuelan pair of Camille Pin and Milagros Sequera for a place in the finals of the $145,000 Tier IV event. 

The top seeds, who were expected to pull off an easy win against their unseeded rivals, were in for a shock as Nuria and Arantxa outplayed them in the opening set to take the initial advantage. 

However, the Indo-US pair came back strongly to clinch the second set and take the match into a decider, which turned out to be an engrossing affair. 

Both the teams matched each other shot for shot as the third set went into a tie-breaker, where Sania and Vania held their nerves.

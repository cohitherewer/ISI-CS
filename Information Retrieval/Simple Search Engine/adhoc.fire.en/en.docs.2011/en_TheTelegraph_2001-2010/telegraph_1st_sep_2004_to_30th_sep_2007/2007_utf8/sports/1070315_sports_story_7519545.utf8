 Anderson breaks finger

Gros Islet: England pace bowler James Anderson has fractured the little finger on his right hand, an England team spokesman said on Wednesday. 

An X-ray confirmed the break and he will be reassessed by medical staff on Thursday. 

Right-arm paceman Anderson is now doubtful for Englands opening World Cup Group C clash with New Zealand on Friday. He was battling with three others for the two seam bowling spots in the line-up. 

The 24-year-old sustained the injury during training and was immediately taken for further examination at a local hospital. 

Anderson has only just recovered from a back problem which forced him out of Englands recent victorious tri-series campaign in Australia. 

Meanwhile, captain Michael Vaughan said on Wednesday he hoped to play a full part in the match versus New Zealand on Friday. 

The 32-year-old has been working his way back to full fitness after knee and hamstring injuries but only fielded for part of the warm-up games with Bermuda and Australia last week. Hopefully Ill prove on Friday that I can get through a game, Vaughan said. 

Ive trained every single day and Ive had nothing go wrong with the hamstring and nothing go wrong with the knee and Im just looking forward to playing cricket now. 

There is absolutely nothing to suggest I wont play a full part in this World Cup.

 Boucher equals world record as SA make it 2-1

Cape Town: South Africa raced to a crushing 10-wicket win over Pakistan in the fourth one-day international at Newlands Sunday. South Africas pace bowlers took advantage of an overcast weather and a helpful pitch as they bundled out Pakistan for 107. 

Then South African opening batsmen Graeme Smith and AB de Villiers hammered a demoralised Pakistan bowling attack to take their side home in only 14 overs, with Smith finishing the match by smashing Abdul Razzaq over midwicket for six. 

Wicketkeeper Mark Boucher equalled the world record for six catches in a ODI. 

The win gave South Africa a 2-1 lead in the five-match series.

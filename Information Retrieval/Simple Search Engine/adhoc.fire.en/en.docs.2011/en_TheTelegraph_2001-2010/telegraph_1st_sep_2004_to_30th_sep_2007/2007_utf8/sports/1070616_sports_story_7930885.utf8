The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No Sir David, for now

London: The iconic David Beckham has been left out of the Queens birthday honours list. 

The omission of Beckham comes amid speculation that he would be knighted, a local newspaper reported on Friday. The honours are to be presented on Saturday. 

The 32-year-old made a dramatic return to the England XI after being left out in the wake of 2006 World Cup debacle. 

Beckham was reportedly favoured for a knighthood following his key role in Londons successful bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games. 

To knight him would have been unprecedented since sportspersons are normally honoured after their retirement, the report said. 

51-year-old cricket legend Ian Botham, wholl be knighted, should have earned the honour long ago for his on-field heroics. 

The former captain was one of Englands greatest allrounders with 5200 runs and 383 wickets in 102 Tests. Besides, he single-handedly led England to victory over Australia in 1981. He was awarded an OBE in 1992. 

But controversies off the field, particularly after his playing days, seemed to have put him out of favour. (PTI)

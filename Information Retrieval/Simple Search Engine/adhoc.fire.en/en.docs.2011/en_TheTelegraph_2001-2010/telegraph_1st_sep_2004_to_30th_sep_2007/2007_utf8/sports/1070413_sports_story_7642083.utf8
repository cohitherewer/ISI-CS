 Dickie Bird 

irked

London: Dickie Bird is irked by plans of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to allow county players to refer decisions to the TV umpire in this seasons 50-over Friends Provident Trophy. 

The umpire that I was brought up to be is finished. Their authority and integrity is being taken away and its a very sad day for cricket, he was quoted as saying in a British tabloid. 

If players are allowed to challenge an umpires decision, all you have left is a man who counts six balls in an over and a glorified hat stand. 

I was not totally opposed to the introduction of technology to help with line decisions but I was worried it would be the thin end of the wedge, he said. (PTI)

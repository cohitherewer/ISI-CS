The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Football, hockey lose status 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Hockey and football are no longer Indias

 top priority. 

In a sensational development, the youth affairs and sports ministry on Wednesday downgraded the two disciplines on its three-tier category list for continuous poor performance in major international tournaments. 

Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday that hockey has been stripped of its priority status and pushed to the general category. Ministry sources later confirmed that football has been demoted from general category to the lowest tier the others category. 

Under the ministrys classification, all sports and national federations have been divided into three categories, based on their performance in major international meets. 

All games that figure in the priority and general categories receive financial assistance for participating in international meets, coaching camps, training abroad, buying equipment and hosting national and international tournaments, while games belonging to the others category do not receive these facilities. 

Football, according to ministry sources, will now only receive government grants for holding national championships. 

Till date, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) was receiving financial assistance from the Centre for hosting camps and sending teams for all major international meets, including the age group championships. 

The ministrys move may cost AIFF a financial loss to the tune of more than Rs 1 crore. 

So far, the ministry was at least footing the bills for sending most of the teams abroad and was paying for coaching camps. If that is stopped, it will cost the federation heavy, said an official. 

The ministrys move came close on the heels of Fifa president Sepp Blatters visit to the country as part of the Asian Football Confederations Vision India project. 

Taking a dig at the games infrastructure here, Blatter had also said that India were in the past, past century. He, however, stressed that the governments help was a prerequisite to developing the game. 

In the Lok Sabha, Aiyar said that the government is concerned with Indias performance in hockey. The ministry, he pointed out, had sought the Indian Olympic Associations intervention to improve the game, but nothing had happened. 

The Union government spent Rs 35,11,935 on national coaching camps for mens hockey, the minister said in a statement. 

Apart from this, an advance of Rs 23,80,950 was given to the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) for meeting the boarding and lodging expenses of the team for participation in the World Cup and Rs 26,61,436 towards passage cost of the team. 

The IHF secretary K. Jyothikumaran criticised the governments decision, saying it would not help anyone. 

The sports ministry has promoted a sport like wushu to the priority list, demoting hockey to general category. We dont know how this is going to help in improving the game, he said. 

In a recent report, International Hockey Federation observer Bob Davidzson has highlighted financial woes, outdated systems and poor coaching modules as some of the vices that continue to plague Indian hockey. 

Aiyars move, thus, has made the task for two under-pressure bodies AIFF and IHF even more difficult.

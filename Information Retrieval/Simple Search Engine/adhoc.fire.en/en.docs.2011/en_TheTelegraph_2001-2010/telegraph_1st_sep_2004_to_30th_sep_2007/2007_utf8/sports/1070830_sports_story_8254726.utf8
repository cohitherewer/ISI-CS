The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Strangely, doctors only for the derby 

 games

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The prasanta dora escape

 Dora 

 Calcutta: Former Indian 

 goalkeeper Prasanta Dora, who is currently doing duty for 

 Calcutta Port Trust in the Sahara CFL Premier Division, 

 has been lucky. Next time however, luck may not be on his 

 side or some other local footballer could end up losing 

 his life. 

 On Tuesday, during a Premier Division 

 match at the Mohun Bagan ground, Dora collapsed following 

 a collision with Peerless footballer Subair Muritala. Owing 

 to the absence of even one doctor at the ground, Dora was 

 rushed to the SSKM hospital without medical attention. Fortunately 

 he survived. According to IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly, arranging 

 doctors for every match is not possible. We 

 have got a medical unit at Eden Gardens and if any player 

 is injured he can be treated there, he said. 

 At the same time the secretary 

 admitted that pressure forces the IFA to ensure 

 doctors are present in derbies between East Bengal and Mohun 

 Bagan. 

 The questions which need to be 

 answered are 

 (a) Should 

 the IFA discriminate between the couple of the big teams 

 and rest, and 

 (b) Should 

 the IFA not use the funds generated, among other things, 

 by television rights, to streamline actually, professionalise 

 the medical aid which should be at hand at all grounds. 

 Significantly, on Tuesday, only 

 two Premier Division matches were held. 

 Meanwhile, Dora was released from 

 the hospital on Wednesday evening. I am feeling fine 

 now But things could have worsened had my teammates not 

 taken me to the hospital. I was totally unconscious. I didnt 

 know there was no doctor on the ground at that time I came 

 to know about this only today, he said. Though 

 this is part of the game, I hope now the authorities will 

 arrange doctors for every match, he added. Following 

 Cristiano Juniors death during the Federation Cup 

 final three years ago, the All India Football Federation 

 has made it mandatory for each club to have a doctor while 

 taking part in a national tournament. Besides, the federations 

 own medical staff is present during the meet. 

 I have submitted my report 

 to the IFA and its up to them to decide on the fate 

 of the match, he said.

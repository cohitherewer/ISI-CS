 Jones smitten by India, Sachin

Montego Bay: Bermuda cricketer Malachi Jones is so enamoured by the quality and reputation of Sachin Tendulkar that he may not mind dropping him. 

Jones is an allrounder who loves India and whose favourite player is Sachin Tendulkar. If a catch was to come his way, you never know he might end up dropping it, said Bermuda captain Irvine Romaine. 

The passion may be right up there for the cricketers from the small island nation, but being amateurs does not help them improve the standard of their game. 

Amateurs we certainly are. We get to play cricket only on Saturdays and Sundays and we train only for two hours, four to six, and that too after work, Romaine said.

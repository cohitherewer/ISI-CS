 Sheffield manager vents ire at Ferguson

GARY JACOB amp; TOM DART

Sheffield United will feel all the more aggrieved that Carlos Tvez helped to ensure that West Ham United avoided relegation Sunday as the Barclays Premier League campaign ended in acrimony, anger and the possibility of legal action. The Argentina forward scored the winner as West Ham defeated Manchester United 1-0 at Old Trafford, where Sir Alex Fergusons decision to leave out four first-choice players provoked ire at Bramall Lane. 

Sheffield were relegated at the end of their first season back in top flight. They lost 1-2 to Wigan Athletic, who survived by virtue of a marginally better goal difference. Neil Warnock, the Sheffield manager, questioned Fergusons decision and criticised Liverpool for fielding an understrength team when they lost to Fulham last week. 

Sir Alex probably sold me a dummy in midweek and to see him celebrating on the pitch after being presented with the Premiership trophy leaves a bitter taste, Warnock said. You can blame everyone really, cant you? 

What goes around comes around. Probably Chelsea will beat United in the Cup Final and AC Milan will do the same to Liverpool in the Champions League. I suppose when youre a foreign manager like Rafa Bentez, he doesnt give two hoots about what Sheffield think, or anybody else. 

Warnocks club will lose out on a minimum of 15 million in television revenue and more in gate receipts, sponsorship and commercial income. Its a gut-wrenching, horrible feeling, Warnock, whose contract expires in the summer, said. He refused to discuss his own future. 

Sheffield are likely to pursue their threat of legal action against the FA Premier League for not deducting points from West Ham for breaches of the rules in the signing of Tvez and Javier Mascherano, the Argentina players. 

They have provisionally arranged a meeting this week with the other members of the Gang of Four Charlton Athletic, Fulham and Wigan angered by the Leagues decision. Another report says Middlesbrough have joined the aggrieved clubs in their quest for justice. The clubs have asked for proof that Tvez has been eligible to play in the past three matches after the independent commission hearing into his transfer.

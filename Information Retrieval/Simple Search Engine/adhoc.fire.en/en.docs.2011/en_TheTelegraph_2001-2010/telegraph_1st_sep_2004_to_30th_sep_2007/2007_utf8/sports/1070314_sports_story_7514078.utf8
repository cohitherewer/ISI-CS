 Bus breaks down

Port of Spain: The Indian contingent, by the way, suffered their first hiccup of the 2007 cricket World Cup as their team bus broke down on their way to the team hotel in St. Anns. 

The bus carrying them from airport to the team hotel broke down on the Churchill-Roosevelt highway in the vicinity of El Socorro junction. 

Upon passing the El Socorro traffic lights, one of the three Team India buses broke down, forcing police to stop the convoy and block off the area, long enough for them to be offloaded and relocated to the back-up bus. 

Then they continued on its way to the Hilton Hotel, where the four visiting teams (India, Sri Lanka, Bermuda And Bangladesh) will stay while they are in Trinidad for the group B matches. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CRA withdraws boycott call 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The Calcutta Referees Association (CRA) has decided to withdraw its boycott call, following a meeting with IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly on Monday. Our decision to hold a few CFL Premier Division matches under outstation referees supervision was not intended to insult the local referees. We have complete faith in them, said Ganguly. 

The local referees decided to boycott all matches from Sunday, protesting the IFAs decision to hire outstation officials. 

Meanwhile, two Premier Division matches Calcutta Port Trust vs Peerless and Eastern Railway vs George Telegraph which were supposed to be held on Sunday, will now be played on Tuesday. The matches will be officiated by local referees.

 Golfers death shocks India

New Delhi: The Indian golf fraternity was in shock after the sudden demise of one of its most upcoming players, Bangalores S. Madaiah, who was killed in a road accident on Saturday. 

Madaiah is survived by his wife, parents, a brother and a sister. 

According to reports, the 26-year-old golfer was involved in a head-on collision with a truck, an accident that took the lives of both him and his travelling companion. 

Ajay Gupta, tour commissioner of Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI), expressed the grief felt by all his colleagues on the tour. 

It is a sad moment for the entire golfing community. Madaiah was one of the best golfers to emerge out of the south in recent years and he had a great future ahead of him, Gupta said. 

PGTI board member, Digvijay Singh added: Madaiah was a talented golfer and had achieved a lot in his short career. But more importantly, he was respected by his counterparts on the tour and got along with everyone. He will definitely be missed. 

Madaiah hailed from a village in Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu. His family moved to Bangalore in search of employment when he was eight. 

His initiation into the sport came through frequent visits to the Karnataka Golf Association course where both his father and mother were employed as daily-wage labourers.

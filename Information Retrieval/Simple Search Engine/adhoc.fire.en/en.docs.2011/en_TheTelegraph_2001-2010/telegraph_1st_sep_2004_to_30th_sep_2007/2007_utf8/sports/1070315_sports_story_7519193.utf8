 Were settled physically and mentally: Chappell

 Chappell

Port of Spain: Team India coach Greg Chappell said a welcome break from non-stop playing has revitalised the players before their World Cup campaign starts on Saturday. 

The 1983 champions face Bangladesh in their opening game in Group B, seen as the toughest because of the presence of Sri Lanka, besides debutants Bermuda. 

India trained in Jamaica and enjoyed time away from frenzied attention back home but opinion has been divided whether it was ideal to arrive so early in the Caribbean. 

Its been a good preparation, Chappell told reporters on Tuesday, a day after the team arrived in the Trinidadian capital of Port of Spain. Its a chance for us to get used to the conditions in a measured way without having to rush anything. 

Weve been doing practice, relaxing, weve been swimming, sailing, snorkelling, things you would expect to do in the West Indies. So its been a nice change of pace from the point of view of what happens on a normal tour, particularly in India where you are playing every three days. 

There has been some worry over an ankle problem to Sourav Ganguly, who did not open the batting in Fridays warm-up victory over the hosts West Indies in Trelawny, Jamaica after he fielded for only for 13 overs. But Chappell said there were no concerns in the side. 

Most of the niggles are gone, so it has just given us a chance to get ripe a bit. Thats what this time was meant for, Chappell said. Were looking forward to our first game, he added. 

People who want to find negatives can go ahead and do so, but the players think differently, Chappell said. The guys have enjoyed just having a few days peace and quiet before the tournaments start. 

Were settled physically and mentally, and the guys are ready for it. Were here to play in a tournament and well get on with the task. 

Chappell also ruled out a big stage fright for the youngsters who would be playing in their first World Cup. 

Its their first World Cup, so people talk about it. But its a cricket tournament and they have played cricket tournaments before. They are ready, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fitness worries for Bagan, EB

JAYDEEP BASU

 Barreto and Alvito, the key men in the Fed Cup clash 

Ludhiana: Far from the madding crowd, frenzied support and varied emotions, East Bengal and Mohun Bagan are quietly lumbering up to cross swords for a place in the Federation Cup final. 

The Calcutta giants will clash in the semi-final on Tuesday at the Guru Nanak stadium here. But unlike in their home town where supporters throng the tent a day before the match and traffic comes to a standstill, the only sizeable presence at the camps was that of the media. 

Both sides, though, are unmindful of the crowd, or the lack of it. But the pressure is telling. 

While East Bengal coach Subrata Bhattacharya does not want to disappoint supporters after the Calcutta Football League failure last month, his Mohun Bagan counterpart, Carlos Pereira, is eager to settle personal scores where he is down 2-3. 

The moods in both camps appear contrasting. Mohun Bagan are racing against time to get their key players fit, while the red and golds are basking in their new found confidence following an awe-inspiring 3-2 win over hosts JCT. 

Bagan players are still recovering from the bout of food poisoning that struck them late on Saturday night. Peter Siddique is on recovery path but the Brazilian coach may persist with Anit Ghosh in case the need arises. 

I dont know how many fit players I will have before the match. Isfhaq (Ahmed) and (Mohammed) Gaffari also complained of stomach upset, the Mohun Bagan coach said. 

On Sunday, Bagan found themselves in a soup and struggled to field a fit side against Viva Kerala after seven players complained of food poisoning. 

Bagan eventually managed to put it across Viva Kerala 3-1, but the fluency was clearly missing. 

But, there is light at the end of the tunnel for Pereira. It is the possible return of Bhaichung Bhutia, who missed the quarter final owing to viral. 

East Bengal have just one injury worry, but that could well be the deciding factor. Brazilian Edmilson has a hamstring injury that is a huge concern for East Bengal coach Subrata Bhattacharya. 

I may not take the risk of playing him (Edmilson) tomorrow, Bhattacharya said late on Monday night after medical report on the Brazilian revealed a minor tear in his hamstring. 

The Brazilian has scored four goals in the last two games and is East Bengals most lethal weapon to take on a suspect Mohun Bagan defence. 

East Bengal will have a second look at Edmilson on Tuesday morning, but the signs emanating from the camp are not encouraging; Bhattacharya having already sounded out Dipendu Biswas. 

Should Edmilson miss out on on Tuesday, East Bengal would be dealt a severe psychological blow. 

Despite the pressure of a high-voltage clash, Bhattacharya remained remarkably cool. He joked with journalists and spoke passionately about his adventures for Mohun Bagan whom he served for close to 25 years as player and coach. 

There is tension during every match, most importantly in a knock-out tournament where our aim is to finish as champions, he said. 

If East Bengal play with the same intensity and shape they did against JCT then it would be a tough job for Mohun Bagan. 

East Bengal lost 3-4 in the CFL tie, but with five additions since then Surkumar Singh, Syed Rahim Nabi, Bolaji Majek, Debabrata Roy and Mehrajuddin Wadoo they are a lot stronger. The Bagan challenge, though, cannot be discounted. If a certain Bhaichung Bhutia or Jose Ramirez Barreto get going, it always gets tough at the other end.

 PCB probe panel to meet today 

Karachi: The three-member PCB committee to probe Pakistans World Cup debacle will meet on Wednesday to discuss the procedure for completing the investigation within the stipulated 30 days. 

We have yet to decide how to go about this task given to us. The preliminary meeting is being convened to formalise the procedures and the areas to be investigated to reach a honest conclusion, PCB director (operations) Saleem Altaf, who is on the committee, said. 

Former Test player Ejaz Butt heads the committee that also includes former Test allrounder and chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed. 

The committee is expected to call Inzamam-ul Haq, who has retired from ODIs, and other players along with the national selectors who have now resigned. 

The committee has been asked to submit its findings in 30 days after which the Board plans to appoint a new coach and captain. 

However, sources said if plans to play a one-day series against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi in mid-May work out then the announcements for the new team management could be made earlier. (PTI)

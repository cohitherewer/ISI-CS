 Only 2 pros in Canada squad

Toronto: Canadas World Cup squad includes a forklift driver, accountant, salesman, and teacher. With just two pros among the 15 players named on Tuesday, Canada will be rank underdogs in its group C matches against England, New Zealand and Kenya in the Caribbean next month. 

But coach Andy Pick, former England A player and England under-19 coach, believed he had players who can make a difference. Weve got six or seven players who can single-handedly alter the result of the game, Pick said. Theyre good enough players to put in a game-changing performance. 

The team features captain John Davison, who plays in Sydney and whose 67-ball century against West Indies was the fastest in World Cup history four years ago; batsman Geoff Barnett, who plays in Blenheim, New Zealand; and Toronto wicketkeeper Ashish Bagai, who was named player of the tournament in the recent World Cricket League (WCL) in Kenya.

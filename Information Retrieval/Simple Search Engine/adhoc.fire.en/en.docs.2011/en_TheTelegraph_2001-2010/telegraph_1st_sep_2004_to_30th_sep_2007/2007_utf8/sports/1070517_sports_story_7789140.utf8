New Delhi: After a three-day stock taking tour of Delhi, the Commonwealth Games Federation Co-ordination Commission is still not fully convinced about the citys ability to host the 2010 Games in time. 

On Wednesday, chairman of the commission Austin Sealy reiterated what he had said on arrival. Addressing a news conference, Sealy said the organisers should remember that Commonwealth Games is the most important sporting event after Olympics. 

The planning and organisation is definitely running behind schedule. The organisers should address this subject urgently. 

Last November, when we came here first, we set them a target. We cant say they met all because there are some grey areas, Sealy said. 

Sealy, it seems, doesnt have much to complain about other stakeholders of the Games such as Delhi government, Municipal Corporation and other agencies. Instead, he hinted the organising committee should improve its performance. 

You have three and a half years to go and the organising committee immediately needs to build a team to deliver. Development of skilled managers cant be delayed and this should be the highest priority, he added. 

Chairman of the organising committee, Suresh Kalmadi, promised things would change before the next visit of the co-ordination commission.

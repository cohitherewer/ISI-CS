 Dad Gilchrist joins squad

Kingstown: Proud new father Adam Gilchrist will not curb his natural attacking game as he prepares to spearhead Australias World Cup defence. 

Gilchrist, who has just become a dad for the third time, arrived too late to feature in his sides warm-up against Zimbabwe, but he is likely to play against England on Friday before the serious matters begin. 

Skipper Ricky Ponting believes that the paternity leave the 35-year-old Gilchrist enjoyed will help inspire him to return to the big-hitting heights. He expects it to be business as usual for Gilchrist. No matter what the situation of the game, he pretty much plays the same way every time. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I dont think the biggest names will be tempted

 - Money, it appears, has been the main attraction: Vengsarkar 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Dilip Vengsarkar 

Mumbai: I accept that the pool of players from which to pick for Team India wasnt big in any case, but those whove joined the Indian Cricket League have done so for reasons I doubt if they discussed things with either family or friends, though 

Well, trust chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar (a former captain) to put things bluntly. 

Speaking to The Telegraph at the sparkling Mumbai Cricket Association office on Tuesday afternoon, he added: Money, it appears, has been the main attraction Theyve made a choice I dont think the biggest names will be tempted simply because theyre already getting plenty when playing international cricket 

According to Vengsarkar, the present scenario is vastly different from the time he and five other Indians (Bishan Bedi, Sunil Gavaskar, Gundappa Viswanath, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar and Syed Kirmani) were approached by Kerry Packers men in 1978-79. 

Then, we hardly got anything There was just no money in international cricket Eventually, nothing materialised as wed been approached rather late and the Establishment sorted things out with Packer Frankly, I dont know what decision I wouldve taken I was, at that point, very young (22) 

Among the finest of batsmen in the Eighties, Vengsarkar had also been approached by Dr Ali Bacher, then organising the rebel tours, for a trip to South Africa. 

Dr Bacher met me in London when, I think, we were on the way back from the West Indies (mid-1989) I put him on to a senior teammate I dont know what happened, but nobody got back to me, Vengsarkar recalled. 

Just as well, for had he been tempted by the Rands, then a ban wouldve followed.

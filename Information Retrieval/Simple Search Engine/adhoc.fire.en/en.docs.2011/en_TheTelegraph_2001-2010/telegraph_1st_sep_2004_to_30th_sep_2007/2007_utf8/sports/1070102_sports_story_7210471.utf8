 Not worried about the Indians: Harris 

Rookie left-arm spinner Paul Harris, who has played for Warwickshire and dons the Titans colours in provincial cricket, is expected to make his Test debut on Tuesday. On Monday afternoon, the 28-year-old (Harare-born) interacted with the Media. 

The following are excerpts 

Im not worried about what they (India) will be doing, Im worried about what I have to do... If picked, Im going to have a job to do... It will be a dream come true as, early on, its here that I played my cricket... I havent been inspired by any left-arm spinner, but have grown with the help of (provincial and former Pakistan coach) Richard Pybus... Hes great and made a left-arm roller into a left-arm spinner... I didnt extend my contract with Warwickshire as I wanted to play for South Africa... Money wasnt an issue and I believe Im the man for the job... Nicky Bojes retirement (last month) didnt mean too much for me... Didnt bother about the message that was sent out (to spinners)... The Indians are known to play spinners well... (Rahul) Dravid is a serious player, but Im not worried about the Indians... Ive worked on my fielding and while I would love to open the batting, I hope Im not sent as jack (No.11)!

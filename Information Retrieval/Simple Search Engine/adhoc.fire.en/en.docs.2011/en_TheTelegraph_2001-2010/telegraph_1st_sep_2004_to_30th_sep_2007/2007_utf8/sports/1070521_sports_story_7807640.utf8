 Jankovic bags Italian Open

 Jelena Jankovic 

Rome: Jelena Jankovic continued her impressive preparation for the French Open when she beat world number three Svetlana Kuznetsova 7-5, 6-1 in the final of the Italian Open on Sunday. 

The 22-year-old Serb, seeded three in Rome, was far too consistent for her Russian adversary, who made a series of unforced errors to lose eight of her 10 service games. 

Its an unbelievable win for me. Ive got better and better through the week, said Jankovic, whose win will move her up to fourth in the world when the new rankings are published on Monday. 

The title was Jankovics third of 2007 and her second on clay following her victory at the prestigious Family Circle Cup in Charleston last month. 

It also capped a year of steady progress for the Serb, who came into last years Rome tournament on the back of 10 successive defeats but reached the quarter-finals to start her climb up the world rankings. 

I almost thought of quitting tennis, she admitted. But it was here that everything turned around. And now one year later Im here holding the trophy and Im number four in the world. Its amazing. 

The hard-fought final that had been expected between two of the most in-form players on the womens circuit never really materialised on Romes centre court. 

Kuznetsova had finished runner-up in three tournaments this year, including last weeks claycourt German Open in Berlin, and had not dropped a set on her way to the Rome final, but her hard-hitting baseline game was misfiring. 

Several times the second seed rallied herself into a winning position only to blast the shot that should have been a winner long or wide.

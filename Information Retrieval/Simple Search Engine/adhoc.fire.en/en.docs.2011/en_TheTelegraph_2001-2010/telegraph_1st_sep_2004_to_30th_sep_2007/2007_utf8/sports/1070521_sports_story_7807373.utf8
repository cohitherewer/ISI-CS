 Hargreaves 

off to United

Berlin: Bayern Munich have reached a transfer agreement with Manchester United for England midfielder Owen Hargreaves, Bayern president Franz Beckenbauer said on Sunday. 

Owen is leaving. That was the players wish. Its a good match and its also a good deal financially, Beckenbauer told a German sports television. 

Beckenbauer did not directly confirm media reports that Bayern will get 25 million euros ($33.75 million) for the Canadian-born Hargreaves. But he did say: Its in that range. 

If confirmed, it would be the highest fee ever for a Bundesliga player. 

Hargreaves, 26, has been pleading with Bayern executives to let him go to United all season in a disappointing year both for him and the club. 

Bayern finished fourth in the Bundesliga and without any silverware after back-to-back league and cup doubles.

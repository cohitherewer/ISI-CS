 Sachin amp; Co. arrive

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chittagong: Team Indias Test specialists arrived in the port city on Monday afternoon. 

The seven players Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble, Sourav Ganguly, V.V.S. Laxman, Wasim Jaffer, V.R.V. Singh and Rajesh Pawar landed here via a direct flight from Calcutta. Kumble and Jaffer were accompanied by their wives, while newly-married Dinesh Karthiks wife also came on the same flight. 

That was, in fact, the last flight to land. All flights thereafter were cancelled owing to inclement weather. 

Manager Surendra Bhave, meanwhile, was seen wearing the India cap during indoor nets on Monday. For the record, he has never represented the national team.

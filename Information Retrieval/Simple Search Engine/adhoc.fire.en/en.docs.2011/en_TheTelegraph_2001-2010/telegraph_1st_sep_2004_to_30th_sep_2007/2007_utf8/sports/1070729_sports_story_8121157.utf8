 Hope Sachin goes past Lara: Donald

 Allan Donald 

Former South African spearhead Allan Donald, who is now Englands bowling consultant, saluted Sachin Tendulkar on Saturday. 

The following are excerpts 

Hes the best Ive seen... Best in my era and theres a lot more cricket in him... He still looks so boyish... Its unbelievable that he has stuck around for so many years (almost 18) and what he has achieved... Its a bit scary to notice the number of hundreds (37) he has notched up in Test cricket, not to forget the ones (41) in ODIs... I hope he goes past (Brian) Laras mark (11,953 runs in Tests) as he deserves it... Hes such a humble, wonderful guy who plays his cricket hard... It will be nice to see him go past that... He has been phenomenal and a credit to the game...

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indian squad to be picked on Feb. 11 or 12 

Vadodara: The Indian squad for the upcoming World Cup in the Caribbean would be chosen on February 11 or 12. 

The selectors, who are to meet in Mumbai on February 3 to pick the squad for the Sri Lanka series, will decide on the date and the venue, either Rajkot or Mumbai, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said on Monday. 

That means the selectors have three more matches, the last of the West Indies series here on Wednesday and two of the four-match Sri Lanka series, to assess the players before making up their mind on the final combination. 

The first two ODIs against Sri Lanka are to be held in Calcutta (February 8) and Rajkot (February 11) and the final 15-member World Cup squad needs to be sent to the International Cricket Council on or before February 13. 

The combination chosen for the first two ODIs against the Lankans who would play the last two matches of the series in Goa (February 14) and Vishakapatnam (February 17) would very much be the squad for the World Cup to be held in March-April. 

Team India are slated to land in the Caribbean on March 1. 

Meanwhile, BCCI was yet to prepare a final draft for the contracts to be issued to the players for their perusal. We are still having discussions on the final draft, Shah said.

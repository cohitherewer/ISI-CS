 Tapes sent to UK

Kingston: Footage of the closed circuit television (CCTV) on the 12th floor of the hotel, where Bob Woolmer was found dead on March 18, has been sent to a laboratory in the United Kingdom. 

The Scotland Yard detectives, who are here to assist the Jamaican police in the investigation of Woolmers mysterious death, sent the tapes to the UK last week and said experts there would take a deeper look at the footage, among other items of interest. 

This was confirmed yesterday by a high-ranking officer of the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF), according to a newspaper report. 

The four Scotland Yard detectives were invited to assist in the Woolmer case at the request of police commissioner Lucius Thomas. Local detectives spent hours transferring hours of footage from VHS tape into a digital format, the paper said. (PTI)

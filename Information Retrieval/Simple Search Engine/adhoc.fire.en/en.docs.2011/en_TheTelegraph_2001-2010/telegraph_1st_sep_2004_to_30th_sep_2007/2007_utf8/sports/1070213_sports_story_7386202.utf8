The Goa Professional League champions, Sporting, tested Nath in two friendly matches and are quite satisfied with his performance. He scored a goal each in both the matches. With Nigerian striker Dudu also on their rolls, Sporting expect Nath to make a significant contribution in the next phase of the National Football League (NFL).

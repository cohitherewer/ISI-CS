 Sunny sorry for comments on Hookes

Melbourne: Sunil Gavaskar has apologised for linking cricketer David Hookes death with the Australias poor on-field behaviour, saying his remarks were uncalled for and inappropriate. 

On live television and radio, sometimes you respond on the spur of the moment with a remark that can cause hurt and pain to others. I realise and I accept that what I said was uncalled for and inappropriate, Gavaskar reportedly told a local radio station. 

Having said that, I hope they have the bigness of heart to forgive me for what I said about David Hookes, he was quoted as saying by the local media. 

The former Indian captain recently wrote in a column that Australia were an unpopular team despite their world domination due to their awful on-field behaviour. 

Gavaskar, however, maintained his criticism of the Aussies. 

What I was trying to say, the West Indies in the 1970s and 80s... They were winning just about everything, but they were universally admired, he said. 

There are so many champions who are universally admired, like your Rod Laver, today there is Roger Federer. 

The Australian team can also be universally admired if they can only curb their behaviour on some occasions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Memories set to rule 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The Invitational Weekend action begins at the RCTC on Saturday at 12.35 pm, but the excitement may only build up minutes before the starter signals the release of the lever for the 3.30 pm event the 1,200m Nanoli Stud Sprinters Cup. All the eight horses in the line-up for afternoons show-piece event are champions in their own right but the race is meant to determine the champion of the champions.

 Oyster Cove, Caprese and Romantic Fire are taking a second try after Spectacular Quest dashed their dreams in the Bangalore edition of the race last year. Get Fresh, Atmosphere and Evatina, having matured late, are taking their chance against youngsters such as Dynasty and Haunting Memories. The race has all the ingredients and a tough competition is on the cards. Yet, one is inclined to give Haunting Memories a solid edge over the rest.

 The Memories, a Placerville-Haunting Beauty daughter, was rated as the best three-year-old youngster in the country until the emergence of her stablemate, Southern Empire. Further, her limitations over the Classic trips must have been the real reason behind owner MAM Ramaswamy pushing the filly into sprints. She possesses a lot of class and she is bound to exploit it over all trips up to a mile. Colm Donoghue partners the filly, saddled by Robert Foley. He is deputising for S. Ganapathy, who is recovering from a heart surgery.

 Aperitivo is another one who boasts of his superior class. The Diffident-Dramatic Irony son takes on six rivals in the 3,000m Olympia Technology Park Stayers Cup. The Vijay Singh-trained six-year-old is rated 140 and it reflects his superior credentials against those rated more than 20 points lower.

 Badge Of Gold will be the hottest property on the day. The Razeen-Veenas Pet son, though up against two well-performed Vijays youngsters, looks home and dry in the 1,400m race. In Bangalore, the Ganapathy-trainee had thrashed good set of rivals in each of his last two outings.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

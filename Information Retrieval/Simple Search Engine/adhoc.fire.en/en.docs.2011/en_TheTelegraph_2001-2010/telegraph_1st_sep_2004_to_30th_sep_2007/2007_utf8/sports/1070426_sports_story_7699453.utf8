 Negi tied 7th after draw

Malmo: Parimarjan Negi let go an advantageous position and settled for a draw with local favourite Tiger Hillarp Persson to drop to tied seventh after Round 7 of the the Sigeman amp; Co. International Chess Championship. 

The draw took the 14-year-old Indians tally to three points for a share of the seventh spot with Dutchman Erwin Lami. 

It turned out to be a good game for Negi After the disappointing loss in the previous round. After a keenly contested battle arising from the Pirc Defence, Negi was able to put Persson under pressure. 

The game was drawn after 53 moves. The Indian will look for wins in the last two rounds against leader Ivan Cheparinov of Bulgaria and Swede Emil Hermansson for a decent finish

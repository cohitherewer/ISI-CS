 Houghton confident 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Having returned to India after nine weeks and a successful hip surgery, the national coach Bob Houghton is confident that things would fall in place in Indian football by the end of the year. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Wednesday, Houghton who will join the pre-Olympic camp in Goa on Friday said he was aware of Indias poor showings in the pre-Olympics. 

During my tenure I couldnt get the services of players like Deepak Mondal, Mahesh Gawali and Climax Lawrence consistently for different reasons. Now that they are fully fit, I am sure the national team would be stronger with them.

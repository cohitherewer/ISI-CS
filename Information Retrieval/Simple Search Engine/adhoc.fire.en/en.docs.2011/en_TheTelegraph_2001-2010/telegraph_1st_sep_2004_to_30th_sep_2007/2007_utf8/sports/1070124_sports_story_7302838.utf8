The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Gibbs hearing today

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Herschelle Gibbs appeal against his two-Test ban for breaching the ICCs Code of Conduct will be heard on Wednesday via teleconference (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition). 

According to an ICC release received here, the hearing will be conducted by former Australia captain Richie Benaud, who is acting as the Appeals Commissioner in this matter. 

The teleconference will also involve Gibbs, his legal representative, Match Referee Chris Broad and a legal representative acting on his behalf. ICCs in-house lawyer Urvasi Naidoo will also be present on the call in an administrative capacity. 

Under the terms of the appeals procedure, Benaud has seven days in which to hear and determine the appeal following his appointment as Appeals Commissioner. 

Benaud has the power to increase, decrease, amend or otherwise substitute his own decision from that made at the previous hearing, and his decision is final and binding. 

Gibbs was charged with making derogatory comments about Pakistanis during the first Test in Centurion on January 14. Stump microphones picked up the South African batsman using abusive language. 

Following a hearing by the Match Referee Broad, he was imposed the two-Test suspension. He was guilty of a Level 3 offence, specifically a breach of clause 3.3 of Code of Conduct. 

Gibbs apologised for the remark but pleaded not guilty to the Level 3 charge. Gibbs subsequently appealed against the ban and played in the second Test.

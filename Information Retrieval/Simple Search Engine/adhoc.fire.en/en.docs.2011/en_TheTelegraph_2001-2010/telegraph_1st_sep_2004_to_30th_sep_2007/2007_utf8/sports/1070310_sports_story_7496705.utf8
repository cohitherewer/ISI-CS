Singapore: Jyoti Randhawa climbed to the top of the leaderboard at the halfway stage of the Singapore Masters golf here on Friday. 

The 34-year-old Gurgaon golfer shot a brilliant round of four-under-par 68 on the demanding masters course at the Laguna National Golf Club and enjoyed a one-stroke lead over Scotlands Barry Hume at 11-under 133. 

Hume overcame a late double-bogey to stand alone in second place at 10-under, while Malaysias Ian Steel and Briton Gary Lockerbie were a shot further back in a tie for third place. 

Overnight joint leader Liang Wen-Chong of China could only manage a level-par second round to be tied for fifth place at eight-under 136 with Irelands Peter Lawrie. 

Among other Indians in the fray, Gaurav Ghei continued his fine run and a two-under 70 gave him tied eighth place at six-under 138. 

Rahil Gangjee and Jeev Milkha Singh also made the halfway cut. Gangjee was tied 24th at four-under 140 after a 68, while Jeev struggled to a one-over 73 and made it to the weekend right on the cut-line. 

S.S.P. Chowrasia (72), Amandeep Johl (71) and Shiv Kapur (77), failed to make the cut which came at two-under 142. (PTI)

 Iran unlikely for Delhi meet

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The ONGC Nehru Cup meet, scheduled in Delhi from August 17-29, will probably be a five-team affair as Iran are unlikely to participate. 

Iran are willing to send a club team, while all other countries (Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, Syria and Bangladesh) are sending their national teams, AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco said during the launch of the tournament logo. We havent accepted that and have asked them to respond in a day or two. 

As of now, Syria ranked 113 in the world will be the best team in the tournament.

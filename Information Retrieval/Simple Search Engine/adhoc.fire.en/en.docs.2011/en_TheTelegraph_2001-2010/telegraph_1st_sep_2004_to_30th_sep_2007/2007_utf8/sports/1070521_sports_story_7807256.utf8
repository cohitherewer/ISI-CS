The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Multiple injuries not a concern, says Raju

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chittagong: National selector Venkatapathi Raju feels India have enough youngsters to fall back upon when key players are injured. 

Injuries are part and parcel of the game. That isnt a concern. We have some good young players as backup, he told The Telegraph on Sunday soon after arriving here along with colleague Ranjib Biswal. 

Manoj Tiwary, Sreesanth and Munaf Patel have already flown back owing to to injury. While R.P. Singh stayed back after the ODIs, Ishant Sharma, Munafs replacement, also joined the squad. 

Raju, selector from South, maintained that the committee is yet to receive any BCCI directive on picking two different squads for Indias tours of Ireland and England. 

Its too early to say anything. We will sit together after the end of this series and discuss the issue, he said. We hope to watch some action tomorrow (Monday), he added. 

Meanwhile, Ramesh Powar celebrated his 29th birthday on Sunday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I aged a bit, says Smith 

Georgetown: Tension was not all that smouldered in the South Africa dressing room during the final moments of their thrilling one-wicket World Cup win over Sri Lanka the players were reduced to nervy cigarette smoking. 

That was a pretty stressful last five overs, captain Graeme Smith told a news conference after his team scraped to the Super Eight victory on Wednesday with 10 balls to spare. I caught a few of the boys having a cigarette or two in the dressing room. 

Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga caused the South Africans anxiety when he became the first player to take four wickets with consecutive deliveries in an international match. He bowled a superb spell to take four wickets in four balls and he certainly made me age a bit. 

Smith said the experience of winning a close game could prove valuable for the South Africans, who have a history of not fulfilling their potential in World Cup tournaments. 

It was one of those tight games that, if you get through, can really spur you on to better things, Smith said. In World Cups gone by weve probably lost those tight games. 

Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene, on the other hand, said his team would bounce back from Wednesdays dramatic defeat.

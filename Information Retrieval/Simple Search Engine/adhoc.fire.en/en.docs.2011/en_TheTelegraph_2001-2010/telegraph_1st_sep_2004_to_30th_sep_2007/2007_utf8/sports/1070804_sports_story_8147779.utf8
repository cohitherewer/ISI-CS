Akron: Jeev Milkha Singh made a decent start with a two-over 72 on a tough scoring day at the challenging Firestone Country Club to be 38th at the end of the first round of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational here. 

Jeev, the Asian Tours UBS Order of Merit winner in 2006, had two birdies and four bogeys, two of which came in late stages of the round on Thursday. 

The field is being shared by three players Hunter Mahan, Paul Casey and Rory Sabbatini who shot 67 each. Defending champion Tiger Woods lurking a stroke back. 

Jeev started on the 10th and immediately birdied the hole, but bogeys on 13th and 16th set him back. He added a birdie on third only to give away shots on fifth and sixth. 

In a star-studded 83-man field, only 13 managed to break par, indicating how tough the course played. Jeev performed better than the average score, which was 72.18 as most players preferred to hang on and reduce mistakes. 

Meanwhile, flying the Asian challenge strongly was Koreas Choi Kyung-Ju who carded a one-over-par 71 in the opening round to lie four shots off the lead on Thursday. Choi had four birdies against three bogeys and one double bogey. 

Putts as short as six feet rolled by and Choi has the misfortune of seeing one of his putts go off the slick greens on the 12th. 

Thailands Thongchai Jaidee, exempted into the event from his win at last seasons Volvo Masters of Asia, shot a 73 which was matched by Koreas Yang Yong-Eun. It was a difficult start for Liang Wen-Chong of China as he scrambled to a 75. South African Anton Haig, currently second on the UBS Order of Merit, carded a 77. 

Mahan, the leader, rolled five birdies in a seven-hole stretch and added to his reputation.

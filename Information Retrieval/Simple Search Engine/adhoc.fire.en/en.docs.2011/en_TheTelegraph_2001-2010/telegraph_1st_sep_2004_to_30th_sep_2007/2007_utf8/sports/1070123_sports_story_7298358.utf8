 Younis, Akmal set up victory

- A bad day for Shoaib 

Port Elizabeth: Determined batting by Younis Khan and Kamran Akmal steered Pakistan to a five-wicket victory in the second Test against South Africa on Monday as the tourists levelled the series 1-1. 

Younis was unbeaten on 67 with Kamran Akmal on 57, the pair adding 99 for the unbroken sixth wicket to pull Pakistan out of trouble to reach the victory target of 191 just before tea on Day IV. 

South Africa were dismissed for 124, Pakistan replied with 265. The home side totalled 331 in their second innings. 

Makhaya Ntini and Shaun Pollock grabbed two wickets apiece to reduce Pakistan to 92 for five, before Younis and wicketkeeper Akmal came together. 

Pakistan resumed their second innings on eight without loss, and Ntini made the breakthrough in the seventh over when Imran Farhat, who scored seven, edged an expansive drive to Jacques Kallis at second slip. 

Two overs later, Yasir Hameed was run out for six by Andre Nels direct hit on the stumps at the non-strikers end from extra cover. 

Pakistan slipped to 48 for three when Mohammed Hafeez was trapped in front by veteran mediumpacer Pollock for 32 with a delivery that seemed to be sliding down the leg side. 

Pollock may have dismissed Younis for five in his next over, but he failed to hold on to a return catch that would have reduced Pakistan to 51 for four. 

Meanwhile, Shoaib Akhtar has been ruled out of the rest of the tour after sustaining a hamstring injury and would return home along with injured pacer Umar Gul. 

Shoaib has been fined and reprimanded by the team management for having a heated argument with coach Bob Woolmer in the dressing room on Saturday, which was captured by the TV cameras.

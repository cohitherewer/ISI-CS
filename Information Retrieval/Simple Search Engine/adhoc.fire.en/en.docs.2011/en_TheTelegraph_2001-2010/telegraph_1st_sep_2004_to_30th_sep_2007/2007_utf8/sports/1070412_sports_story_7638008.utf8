 Heroic Leander spelt doom for Kazakhs

The World Cup debacle has cast a pall of gloom over the whole country. Yesterdays cricket icons are todays disgraced symbols of greed. However, one sporting icon is unassailable and untarnished Leander Paes. An amazing 111 Davis Cup matches over 18 years is his unmatched patriotic tally. 

The 33-year-old, at the fag end of his career, pulled out yet another rabbit from his hat when he won the fifth and deciding match of Indias tie against Kazakhstan. Down a set and 1-4 in the second, Paes haunted by the spectre of defeat and a possible humiliating demotion to group II of the Asia-Oceania zone must have switched to heroic mode! 

I have seen Paes heroic mode from close quarters. It is frightening. He seems possessed. His blood-shot eyes have an incendiary focus and the adrenalin surge takes his performance beyond his natural limits. The victories at Frejus in the Davis Cup quarter final against Leconte and Boetsch of France come to mind. Thomas Hallberg of the ITF said it was the greatest upset in the competitions history. 

Paes has been criticised for not letting Rastogi play the fifth match, especially since Bopanna had defeated Makeyev on the opening day for the loss of only six games. Two factors must have influenced Paes decision. Firstly, Davis Cup history is replete with startling upsets. Tension is so high in a deciding fifth rubber that even a 1245-ranked opponent like Makeyev should not be taken lightly. Secondly, Paes just cannot resist a challenge. 

The selection of Rastogi for the last match was a 50-50 call. But in hindsight, one wonders if Rastogi could have picked up valuable experience. The confident Paes has given India another year in group I and we must be more than content with that. 

The return of Bopanna to Davis Cup play was a godsend. Without him we could possibly have lost the tie. Bopanna has an outstanding serve which as we all know is 50 per cent of the game. With smart tactical play and a higher level of fitness, he could shoot up the rankings and prove to be a good anchor for our Cup team in the future. 

Rastogi, after his good showing against Nadal in the Chennai ATP tournament, has not come up to expectations. Standards of other countries such as Thailand, Korea, Chinese Taipei and China in the Asia-Oceania zone are forging ahead and leaving us far behind. Unless our youngsters can make significant progress this year, we will find ourselves in group II very soon. 

Getting into the World Group of 16 teams will be more than a fairytale. With more than 30 nations in the Asia-Oceania group I, II, III and IV, we must look over our shoulders, improve our standards and keep a vigil on the growing minnows lest we meet the same fate as our poor cricketers. 

When Paes hangs up his boots, there will be a big void which will be almost impossible to fill. 

One reads every week with much concern about Sania Mirza dropping a couple of places in the rankings. I spoke to her father who said that Sania will be back on court in early May and possibly manage to play a couple of tournaments before the French Open. In my view, that is not enough time to be at her killing best. 

While resting and treating the stretched ligament in her knee, Sania is working with much fervour in retaining and improving her upper body strength. Happily, her brand presence and mall-opening activities continue and the AITA would never dream of restricting viewers to three measly sponsors. 

Comebacks are always difficult and require patience and perseverance. Let us wish Sania good luck in her endeavour to be back to her best.

 Chowrasia, Ghei in tied 10th spot

Taipei: Defending champion Gaurav Ghei shot a par 72, four shots off the lead, to be at tied 10th as local amateur Chen Ming-Tsuan emerged the leader on Day I of the Taiwan Masters on Thursday. 

Ming-Tsuan, 20, fired a four-under-par 68. 

Also at 10th spot was Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia (72), while Digvijay Singh (77) was 81st and Rahil Gangjee (92) was 92nd. 

Ming-Tsuan battled tough conditions for a two-stroke advantage over compatriots Lu Wei-Chih and Hsu Mong-Nan together with South African Hendrik Buhrmann, who shot matching 70s. 

Ghei, who won the title here last year to end an 11-year title drought, has been in great form this year, having won the Pine Valley Beijing Open also.

 Haq keen on imitating Inzy

Basseterre: Scotland opener Majid Haq not only shares the surname of Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq, but keenly follows his idols exploits. 

Majid remembers clearly the impact Inazamam had on him when he watched the master batsman on TV during the 1992 World Cup, which Pakistan went on to win. 

I was just nine years old when Inzamam was a thumping success in 1992 and Pakistan won the trophy. It instigated a huge interest in cricket and I took up the game, Majid said. 

Inzamam hit a robust 37-ball 60 in the semi-final against New Zealand in 1992 and then a brisk 35-ball 42 in the final against England as Pakistan claimed the title. 

That (the win) is still fresh in my memory and if I could do the same thing as Inzamam did and help Scotland win, it will make my World Cup, said Majid, also a part-time off-spinner. 

The 24-year-old was born in Paisley, Scotland, but his father came from the same town of Sialkot where Pakistan allrounder Shoaib Malik hails from. His mother is from Sargodha. 

Majid got his first chance to meet Inzamam when Pakistan took on Scotland in a one-day International in Edinburgh last year and although he did not play in that game, it was a moment to cherish.

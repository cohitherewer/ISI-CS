 Hail Maria, Queen of the Ovas

ROBERT PHILIP

 Sharapova can clearly cast a spell on men 

Theres Sidkova, Shevdova, Smashnova and Safarova, Hantuchova, Kuznetsova, Makarova and Onraskova. Theres Vaidisova, Ivanova, Birnerova and Cibulkova, Voracova, Kutuzova, and Im still not even half way over 

In fact, over 50 members of the extended Family Ova descended upon Roland Garros this year, including the magnificently monikered Barbora Zahlavova-Strycova, a double-fisted, double-barrelled maiden from Pilzen, and not to forget, Maria Sharapova. 

A Wimbledon winner in 2004 and reigning US Open champion, the Siberian diva has now won as many Grand Slam titles as Tracy Austin, yet there are those who still concentrate on her secondary career as a model rather than her tennis prowess, dismissing her as one of those dippy blonde babes to whom image is everything. 

As someone whose dress-sense has been described as Crumpled Rumpole, I am a less than dedicated follower of fashion but even I can appreciate that Sharapova does bring a certain je ne sais quoi to each catwalk sorry, court appearance, her latest ensemble comprising a shimmering ostrich blue, halter-neck mini and black leggings. 

Dressed she may have been in the style of the Parisian jeunesse doree (golden youth) who party until dawn at Le Baron, a once highly expensive call-girl bar turned super-exclusive nightclub, but the Russian was all business, despatching Frenchwoman Emilie Loit 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). 

Featured in People magazines 50 Most Beautiful People, Sharapova can clearly cast a spell upon men of a certain age, judging by an incident in the interview room where she looked round and commented: Im sweating profusely. Is it me or is it hot in here? To which came the breathlessly innocent reply, Its definitely you thats hot 

Like my flair for haute couture, my mastery of foreign languages is limited to one priceless Spanish phrase No tengo dinero, mi amigo pagara (I have no money, my friend will pay). It ill behoves me, therefore, to poke fun at the linguistic contortions displayed by the team of interpreters who, in their defence, have to cope with every mother tongue from Mandarin to Magyar, Armenian to American. 

Sharapovas countrywoman, Anastasia Myskina, champion here in 2004 and a former world No.2 but now ranked a lowly 51st having played only one match in 2007 because of a chronic toe injury, was crushed 6-1, 6-0 by American Meghann Shaughnessy. She was asked: You are a champion, you will always be a champion, but what made you play in this tournament? 

Answer: To learn what I can do with my foot Try on a shoe or kick a football, maybe, but perhaps it is too soon to attempt to fly across the clay of Roland Garros. 

Another great source of delight is the official Guide des Joueurs which can provide a pleasing diversion to watching Milagros Sequera of Venezuela and Virginie Razzano of France trade backhands which would have cleared the Arc de Triomphe. 

Sequera won 5-7, 6-3, 9-7 (I am reliably informed because I did not see out the full three hours) but I was more interested in learning that, according to one translator, Dinara Safinas very long arms sounded far more threatening in the original French: des bras tentaculaires 

Dinaras big brother, Marat Safin, is described as being, on a perpetual journey seeking the glory of his past. At 27 he is condemned to struggle, he who dominated the hierarchy in the beginning of the century ah, but the writer knows his or her tennis; Dinara cuffed Tzipora Obziler for the loss of but one game, while the hapless Marat looked anything but a former world No.1 in losing to Serbian Janko Tipsarevic in straight sets. 

Among the other little nuggets hidden away in my players guide was the revelation that Russian Nikolay Davydenko, incarnates polyvalence par excellence Polly Valance? Could she be the twin sister of ex-Neighbours star turned pop singer Holly? 

As Ella Fitzgerald sang, I Love Paris in the Springtime which, if you translate it into French then back into English, becomes I Appreciate Paris in the Motivating Force

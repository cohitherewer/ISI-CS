 Harbhajan for Surrey again

London: Theres some welcome news for India-discard Harbhajan Singh. He has been signed up by Surrey for the latter part of the 2007 season. 

The off-spinner will join the County on July 2. He will be replacing Pakistan allrounder Azhar Mahmood. 

Harbhajan, who played for Surrey in 2005, said he was keen to prove that what was Indias loss, was Surreys gain. 

This is obviously a great opportunity for me personally, and I cant wait to get out there and play some great cricket for Surrey, Harbhajan said. (PTI)
